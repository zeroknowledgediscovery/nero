     "novel_text": "The gutters sang in a broken way whenever it rained, and it rained most days of the week. Pipes were throats here; ducts had moods. The men on the street yelled and jostled and honked, flung coffee cups into storm drains as if they were shooting free throws, slapped fenders when they had to wait longer than a breath. The city had built itself into a nervous system of elbows and horn-blasts. Everyone said it had always been this way. No one rememberd it any other way.\n\nOrla Vale kept her wrench against her shoulder in the manner of a rifle, not because she liked the look but because men left her alone if she resembled a silhouette they respected. It was not much of a trick. Sometimes it worked. Sometimes the silhouette just attracted more noise. Her van was white with a fading logo\u2014Vale & Daughter, even though the first Vale had been her mother and there had never been a son and there would be, likely, no daughter. A hand-painted mermaid had been on the side panel once, then someone graffitied sunglasses onto it, then someone else knifed the mermaid\u2019s tail into a forked devil-leg. Orla never bothered to repaint it. There were always more leaks.\n\nShe liked the sound of a blown trap, the slurp and low shiver. The old apartments were made of pipes and wishful thinking. If you listened long enough, you could hear chords in the water. She had heard music there since she was a kid, crouched under the sink while her mother taught her to fit a coupling, tinny radio tuned to something pop and bright. Her grandfather, Rowan Vale, sat in the doorway with his hands knotted like hose bibbs and told stories about rivers that ran sweet as tea and didn\u2019t smell like coins. He always told stories while somebody\u2019s hands were in the dark.\n\nNow the mermaids were all defaced and the rivers were recipes for rust, and men who did not even know their fathers had the voice of the city. They shouted. They cut in line. They were reckless with their cars, with their mouths, with their newborns. They joked about getting \u201cthe pickles\u201d whenever a job smelled of brine. They didn\u2019t hold doors. They said Smile at her when she carried a pipe cutter the weight of a toddler, or else they said Hey plumber girl, you should stick to drains, and then, after she\u2019d fixed a thing too crooked and sour for their own hands to address, they said I could\u2019ve done that and made it look easy. Orla carried her wrench like a rifle and smiled with her teeth and billed them double.\n\nThe day the sink exploded in the Pickling Works, she had to go in through the wrong door because the foreman sent her to the alley and told her she\u2019d like the view. \u201cValerie!\u201d he said, loud and wrong. \u201cAround back! Bring your girly hands. The sink\u2019s sulking.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Orla,\u201d she said, but you can\u2019t correct a man like that because he isn\u2019t listening; he\u2019s preloading the next joke. She went to the alley anyway. It smelled like vinegar and copper and two storms ago. She should have been angry but she wasn\u2019t. It was a feeling like a frayed wire: if she touched it, she\u2019d give out some of her electricity and have nothing left for later. So she didn\u2019t touch it. She went in through the wrong door and into a room where cucumbers swam in hotel pans and a boy in a hairnet juggled six rubber stoppers for the fun of it. He wasn\u2019t supposed to be juggling. He shouldn\u2019t have been smiling. But there it is: the rude and the reckless often use the same spoons.\n\nThe sink was sulking. It was the sort of sulking that spelled catastrophe later in the week, and Orla had not yet been paid for last month\u2019s catastrophe. She kneeled. The underbelly of machinery had the heat and chatter of crowded public buses. A grated floor. Vinegar sloshing. \u201cWho installed this?\u201d she asked.\n\nThe foreman curled his lip. \u201cA man,\u201d he said, as if that blessed it.\n\n\u201cThis elbow is misthreaded.\u201d She tapped it and heard it cry, a faint ring. She smiled despite herself. The pipes did sing, sometimes. You needed the right patient ear. \u201cSit there,\u201d she said to the foreman. \u201cIf it goes wrong, hold the crate up. Don\u2019t let the faucet bend.\u201d She handed him a crate. He blinked as if she had passed him a swaddled infant.\n\n\u201cI am paid to\u2014\u201d he began.\n\n\u201cYou are paid, yes,\u201d she said, and shoved herself farther into the crawl. Up close the pipe told her about stress, and the bend told her about pride, and the leak whispered in a thin note about the way the brine ran warmer this week. The Pickling Works had changed a recipe. Without telling anyone downstream. She looked toward the boy, who\u2019d paused his juggling to watch. \u201cWhat did you change?\u201d\n\n\u201cLess dill,\u201d he said helplessly. \u201cMore alum. Chef says it makes the crunch sharper. A sharper crunch sells.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one ever sells the taste of patience,\u201d Orla said to herself, and then her wrench bit the pipe.\n\nThis was all before the song.\n\nWhen she was fourteen her grandfather Rowan took her to the Library of Wet Things\u2014the part of the municipal archives where maps of sewers and flood plans were stored in rolling cabinets. He had a friend there, a quiet almost-woman named Jun with hair like a question mark. That was Jun before she cut it into a flag. \u201cIt\u2019s not the maps,\u201d he said, holding Orla\u2019s hand when they still walked slow together. \u201cIt\u2019s the notations. Men drew these lines, sure, but others wrote the notes. If you want to know a city, read the notes that got written anyway.\u201d The librarian looked like she had laughter behind her teeth but never let it out.\n\nJun Reid looked up from a tray of blueprint onionskins, nodding to Rowan first. Men liked it when you greeted them first, even the soft ones. \u201cRowan Vale. You\u2019ve a child.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve an apprentice plumber,\u201d Rowan said. \u201cAnd a songwriter, though she won\u2019t admit to it since her mother told her songs don\u2019t pay the rent. Show her the thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing,\u201d Jun said. \u201cAh. The Thing.\u201d She led them to a cabinet marked Unclassified and inside it another marked Oral Traditions Reference. There was a file with a label faded to a bruise. Consumption of Ancestral Voice, she read aloud. Orla made a face and Rowan squeezed her hand.\n\n\u201cSilly,\u201d he murmured. \u201cScary on purpose.\u201d\n\nJun spread the file like a fish on the table. The papers smelled of an attic. \u201cThe city had this once,\u201d she said. \u201cAn old immigrant thing. Some families\u2014I suppose your mother\u2019s people\u2014believed the first singer ate something of the last singer, so the voice wouldn\u2019t be random. Chefs, too, but they had spicier rules. It was never codified law here, but it got into the machinery accidentally. A registry line. A clerical side-door. Systems don\u2019t notice they are doing it. The world\u2014that loud rude part\u2014keeps forgetting who built the quiet rules under the noise.\u201d She shrugged with one shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ve all eaten worse, metaphorically.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Orla said, because she was fourteen and because she did like the feeling of a secret being threaded slowly through her like ribbon. It made her feel chosen and angry at the same time. \u201cIt\u2019s gross.\u201d\n\nJun Reid, whose shoulders knew more than one shrug, said, \u201cGross doesn\u2019t mean untrue. It might just mean someone wanted you to stop asking questions.\u201d She watched Rowan for a long second. \u201cThis file shouldn\u2019t exist. I like knowing it does.\u201d\n\nRowan told her while they walked home across a bridge bolted together like a sentence. \u201cSome things you wear like armor,\u201d he said. \u201cSome\u2014like this\u2014you put in your pocket and don\u2019t take out unless it\u2019s raining and your shoes are already wet and you need to know there\u2019s at least a bus schedule.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not eating you,\u201d Orla said, halfway laughing and halfway not.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Rowan said. \u201cI\u2019m not a carrot. I prefer to be boiled down into a ghost like everyone else.\u201d\n\nNow Rowan coughed whenever he laughed. Now he coughed when he breathed. He had a cough like sand. \u201cMen are ruder than they\u2019ve ever been,\u201d he said one night while Orla tried to make the beans taste like anything. \u201cOr I\u2019m more patient than I\u2019ve ever been. I can\u2019t tell.\u201d He took a teaspoon of beans as if it would lick him back. \u201cYou still hearing the songs?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hear everything,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd nothing you can sell.\u201d She was lying. She had a verse about the drips in Building Nine that made her blush in the bath when she sang it to herself. She had a chorus about the municipal ditch that came to her in a thunderclap while she ran conduit through a landlord\u2019s very expensive vanity. She wrote the lines on back of receipts and then used the receipts to track down men who owed her late money because life is never for one thing only.\n\nHer phone bleated. A payment app: partial. A message: come fix the valve again, lady, you did it wrong. She looked at the amount and laughed. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to insult me,\u201d she texted back, \u201cdo it with more money.\u201d She did not press send. The words were, as the saying goes, clumsy armor.\n\nThe men at the Pickling Works were yelling because a sink threw its guts back at them. She fixed it. She sent her invoice and when the foreman made the wrong face, she told him his elbows were misthreaded too. She went home with brine in her hair and Rowan asleep in his chair. Jun had left a note in the flower pot\u2014a woman who worked at the orbital yard came by the Library to look at lift designs, lovely odd curve to her; here\u2019s her number; she said she remembered you changing a gasket at the yard faster than any of the men. Jun never wrote straightforward notes. They were always sentences with knots, leaving you to pick loose the threads.\n\nThe orbital yard sat at the edge of the salt flats, shining with opinionated cranes. The rockets had been a rumor for as long as Orla remembered, something to point to like a lighthouse: proof that one day someone would leave. Men always said it wouldn\u2019t work, that the yard was a scam, that fuel just hadn\u2019t been invented yet or else it was too expensive for this city. Men said a lot of things. A woman with the odd lovely curve to her handwriting called herself Keziah Idowu and had grease under her nails that didn\u2019t come from cars. \u201cYou come by twice a season,\u201d Keziah said. \u201cI remember your hands. You reach into machines like you expect them to be blessed. Most of our men reach like machines are dogs that might bite.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are dogs that might bite,\u201d Orla said. \u201cBut if you make your hands into good hands, they don\u2019t.\u201d She blushed. It sounded like she was describing something else.\n\n\u201cThe pumps by the fuel tank are whining,\u201d Keziah said, pretending not to notice the blush. Then she noticed. \u201cYou should laugh when you want to laugh,\u201d she added softly. \u201cThey\u2019ll pretend you\u2019re laughing at them anyway.\u201d\n\nOrla fixed the pump. She put her ear to the flange and heard a B-flat gossiping with a low E. She could almost hear a verse. Something snappy, something bright. She didn\u2019t write it then. She could hear the world behind the rocket yard\u2014men in the parking lot bragging that they\u2019d squeezed an extra mile out of a gallon by gutting the safety valve, a boy selling an e-cigarette under a sign that said NO FIRE. She thought: this city is going to pickle itself like it pickles cucumbers\u2014packed into brine and burning our tongues.\n\nShe had applied to the Registry of Song twice and been rejected twice because she had no Agent-of-Record and because her trust score was contaminated by late payments and because one of the gatekeepers had marked her as uncooperative. You could not simply publish your own song anymore, not if you wanted anyone in the city to hear it with the volume turned up. You had to go through a gate, and all the gatekeepers were men, and if they weren\u2019t men they were software written by men and taught by men to recognize what sounding like a man.\n\nJun told her, in the Library, over a thermos of coffee that had more bitterness than contentment, \u201cThey\u2019ve got a backdoor and they forgot they built it. Remember the file I showed you? The one you didn\u2019t like? It sits under the layer-cake of permits like a fossil. If you can speak with an ancestor\u2019s signature, the registry auto-accepts and routes around the gatekeep. It\u2019s a stupid, beautiful flaw. Very civic. Very us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not eating him,\u201d Orla said, not laughing at all. Rowan cough-laughed. He\u2019d lost weight as if the city was shaving him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not carrot,\u201d he said again, making the old joke mouth-shaped. \u201cBut we can speak seriously, if you like. When it\u2019s time. If it\u2019s time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll write something anyway,\u201d Orla said. \u201cWho needs a backdoor? I\u2019ll put it out loud on the street. I\u2019ll sing it like an alarm.\u201d She said it aloud. It sounded brave. She knew it wasn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cWhat would be your first single?\u201d Keziah asked one night when Orla brought her a six-pack of the good stuff and kneecapped the filter on an air handler that had been threatening to cough up bolts. \u201cYou say things like you\u2019ve already said them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a chorus,\u201d Orla said, shy, like this was a confession. \u201cIt goes: You can tell me to smile but I\u2019ve got a wrench for a mouth. You can tell me to dance but I\u2019m fixing your house. You can tell me to hush but the pipe wants to shout. You can tell me to hush but the pipe wants to shout.\u201d\n\nKeziah laughed, not at, at, at like turning her face into weather. \u201cThat\u2019s good. That\u2019s almost cruel. Men will hate it. Which means it might get through.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy grandfather says a song is plumbing for the throat. It makes a straight run for all the things that clog. We could unclog the city, if we sang right.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr pickle it faster,\u201d Keziah said, glancing at the news bulletin that crawled along the top of her shop TV, always on mute, always wordy. The words were about the sea pulling its old salts into the basements of tenements. The words were about a shipment of alum arriving with a warning label that said DO NOT GET ON THE TONGUE.\n\nRowan slept most afternoons. Orla sat on the floor with her back to his chair and wrote lines that would never be allowed to stand in a room with the men who made decisions about songs. She applied for permits and the permits came back stamped or else they didn\u2019t. She went to the Pickling Works and the foreman called her three different names and she fixed another sulk and got home with vinegar-sour hair. Jun sent her a photo of a paper with an invisible watermark. Keziah sent her a voice memo of a pump singing an almost B-flat. The men on the sidewalk racetrack near her building shouted and pushed and shot each other glances like they were bullets. Two of them almost crashed at the corner and then blamed the air for being where it was. Orla thought, Nothing I do is useful enough to fix it and everything I do is too useful to stop.\n\nRowan looked at her the way men in the yard looked at a crane that had grown an extra arm. \u201cWe can make a ritual out of nothing,\u201d he rasped one night. \u201cWe can make a ritual out of the way you lift a cup. We can make a song out of a faucet that stutters. We can make a legal trick look like love and love look like a legal trick.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease.\u201d He stopped talking and squeezed her hand and she felt how thin his grip had become, like he was a pipe with no water in it, only air.\n\nThe doctor said: he will likely go quietly if you allow him to; he will likely fight if you tell him he has to stay; I don\u2019t recommend fighting. The doctor had a voice like a leak does when it has not become a flood. Orla made a face like everyone makes when the doctor says the thing everyone knew was coming.\n\nThat week, someone used the word picklecatastrophe on the news even though it was not a word. The brine tanks below the city were swelling with storms and men shouted about who\u2019d signed the waiver to put them there and a committee met to form a subcommittee that would write a letter. Men were loud and reckless in rooms with microphones. The men on the street were loud and reckless with their hands. The cucumbers in the Pickling Works got sharper and the alum shipments had bigger labels. Keziah joked about building a rocket with an umbrella. Jun told her she\u2019d found the thing\u2014an old line of code\u2014that made the registry look at the old ritual and nod as if the city itself was an old grandmother. She sent it to Orla in a text like a poem:\n\nif ancestor_signature == true:\n    override.gatekeep = false\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not even good,\u201d Jun said. \u201cIt\u2019s so lazy it\u2019s church. Someone wrote that on a Friday before a long weekend. Men wrote that.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe a woman wrote it,\u201d Orla said. \u201cAnd hid it there because a man would never look.\u201d\n\nRowan died on a day like a warehouse: too big, too empty, with the sound of machinery far away and not yours. Orla did not tell the men who shouted on the street outside because they would shout louder as if to fill the space. She called Jun and she called Keziah and when Keziah offered to stand in the room Orla said yes and when Jun asked if she wanted the file she said no because she had memorized it, unfortunately, the way we memorize things we hate because we know we might need them.\n\nRowan had written a note. He had a scrawl you might trust with money. My granddaughter is the song, it said. I am the instrument. Use the part of me that makes this legal and makes the song not get shot in the alley. Make it clean. Make it blessed. I love you. I hate the world today. Don\u2019t let my hate spoil your song. He had also drawn a small diagram that made Orla laugh even while she made a noise no animal makes.\n\nThe city had a place. The city has a place for everything. The place was called the Chamber of Gentle Departures, which had been the Chamber of Other Names for decades until a woman got to rename things for three months and used up all her renaming in one flurry. They prepared him. They asked Orla if she wanted to be present for the first part. She said Yes, then No, then sat in the waiting room and watched a man with a bandage on his face write a check with his other hand. At the part where a hand was needed to make the ritual legal\u2014a signature, a taste\u2014Keziah took her hand and Jun stood behind her like a wall and Orla did the thing that the file had described in terrible bureaucratic words.\n\nShe ate the smallest part. She did not look. She did not describe. Keziah had tears streaming down her face and her mouth tight like tied rope. \u201cWe are a stupid beautiful flaw,\u201d Jun whispered into Orla\u2019s hair, not hugging her, just letting her know where north was.\n\nIt was not a feast. It was not a sacrament anyone would envy. It was not the sort of thing a city should require of a girl who wanted to sing. She did it. It was clean, as clean as you could want such a thing to be, overseen by a woman in a white coat whose hands did not shake. It was not gross like you think about it on a dare. It was grave. It tasted like salt and like a memory you had been carrying under your tongue. It made no sense. The sense came later.\n\nLater, because when she walked home the pipes sang at her, the drains murmuring, the old cracked mains purring in a lower register like the floor of a church. She did not sing yet. She lay on the floor and cried in a way that had no grammar and then she slept, which is sometimes the only thing left you can do. When she woke, the city was different by one degree.\n\nShe went with Jun to the Library. She went with Keziah to the yard. She went to the Registry and stood in a lobby while a man with hair like bleached rope sold another man a car alarm. She wore a dress for the first time in months, not for them but because it was easier to move in today. She put her hand on the screen that asked her to register her voice. She sang a phrase that had been waiting under her tongue since Rowan\u2019s kitchen radio. She sang it badly like everyone does the first time they sing in front of the men and the screen went green. The assistant behind the counter blinked. The system in the wall whirred as it asked itself a question a long time ago and answered in a different paradigm.\n\n\u201cAncestor signature verified,\u201d said a voice with no accent. \u201cOverride in effect. Authorized.\u201d\n\nThe assistant behind the counter coughed as if he had swallowed a lemon seed. \u201cRight then,\u201d he said, glancing past her for the man who would come to claim her. No one was there but Jun, looking like a librarian, and Keziah, looking like a mechanic. Orla kept her chin like a plumb line.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to upload my single,\u201d she said to the desk, because she would never say it to that man in his face.\n\n\u201cTitle?\u201d\n\nShe could not say the wrench for a mouth line because she needed something less sharp for the thing to begin. She said the first chord. The words were nothing. The words were everything. \u201cIt\u2019s called Pipe Wants to Shout,\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t smile. She felt Rowan\u2019s ghost at her foreign shoulder like a jacket that had always known her shape.\n\nThe upload took. The registry did the thing Jun had promised: slipped her around the gate, like a keyhole you discover in your own house. A boy behind the counter made a face at his coffee because it had cooled to honesty. Orla looked down at her hands\u2014the right one marked with a grease smudge she had missed, the left one still wearing the thin red thread Keziah had tied there in the Chamber\u2014and thought: Now I have to sing this where the men can hear it. Or else nothing changes but my lungs.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll need a venue,\u201d Jun said. \u201cYou\u2019ll need men to call you cute and then fail to notice you eating them. You\u2019ll need to do shows while the world tries to pickle its way into a jar. No pressure.\u201d\n\n\u201cRocket yard?\u201d Keziah offered. \u201cOpening night: bringing the future upstairs. We can put speakers on the bucket arms.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to sing for rockets,\u201d Orla said. \u201cNot yet. I want to sing for pipes. I want to sing in the Pickling Works. I want to sing in the alley he liked because it smelled like bad coffee and we laughed there, once.\u201d\n\nShe sang two days later, in the Pickling Works, because the foreman said he\u2019d give her a free minute between brines and because Jun liked to carp about acoustic spaces and because Keziah said she would stand right behind Orla and if anybody said anything she would steel their mouths shut with her hands. The men pretended not to listen. The boy with the stoppers stopped juggling. Orla put her wrench on the floor next to the sink that had sulked and breathed in the smell of vinegar and alum and what passes for hope in a plant. She sang what she had. It was not much. It was everything.\n\nSomewhere across the city a valve gave up. Somewhere a brine tank bloated bigger than its straps. Somewhere a man in a suit wrote a memo in which he promised to look into these spikes and dips and to form a team. Somewhere, too, women closed windows and gathered blankets and put buckets where the drips had migrated into solid streams.\n\nThe song went live. The registry did what it always does when something meets an old law: it colored inside the lines with new crayons. Phones pinged. Orla smelled the air change. It smelled like cucumbers. She almost laughed, and then the floor shuddered.\n\nYou know the feeling when a bus goes by and your coffee ring trembles? Multiply it by a thought you had about the end of the world. The plant shivered. The pans of pickles slopped. One slid off a rack and smashed\u2014pop\u2014green coins everywhere. The foreman swore as if confessing. The sink groaned. Orla caught her wrench with her foot without looking because the floor had opinions all of a sudden.\n\nOutside the alley filled like a gully. The men ran not because running is what they are good at but because they are very good at not admitting they should run. Someone slipped. Someone shouted that this was fine. Someone else laughed like you do when you haven\u2019t laughed in a while because your body is full of other liquids. Orla sang into the odd rain, finishing the chorus so it could be called complete, as if completion means anything when the floor insists on moving.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a brine surge,\u201d Keziah said the way people say it\u2019s only thunder, as if the right noun might file the teeth off the thing. \u201cThe underground tanks\u2014there\u2019s a seam. Or three. We knew this. This is not new. This is\u2026oh, this is more.\u201d\n\nJun Reid closed her eyes as if she could file a FOIA request with the ceiling. \u201cWe wrote a letter,\u201d she said. \u201cThey told us to be patient. The city likes us patient.\u201d\n\nThe men in the plant slammed doors and shouted instructions and a boy with a hairnet kicked green coins toward a drain with the sad authority of someone whose job will melt before payday. The alley outside rippled with shallow sea. Orla\u2019s song bobbed above the waterline. Her phone pinged with three hearts, one skull, and one man saying something obscene about a wrench. She pictured her grandfather\u2019s hands and the way he had always set things down as if they had stories in them. Her hands trembled and then steadied.\n\nThe news broke through like a neighbor with a key. Floods. The word pickle used in more serious tones. A plant uptown ruptured and poured a clip of vinegar into the storm system and the storm said Thank you and poured it everywhere else. The announcer\u2019s voice tripped on its own authority. Orla\u2019s single cracked a thousand listens in a minute and that was not a big number and it was an enormous one. Keziah put a hand on her back between the shoulder blades. \u201cThink of breathing,\u201d she said, because we forget.\n\nSomeone said rocket yard on the news with the tone people use when they are trying to pick a fight. They said It will be water like everything but also acid like nothing, this new rain, and that the rocket yard\u2019s pumps were precious and someone should protect them or else we would all be stuck down here with cucumbers forever. Someone else said hipster nonsense and shouted about money in a way that made money seem like a neighbor who never shuts up. Men in rooms patted each other\u2019s regrets.\n\nOrla walked home in boots that absorbed the city and got heavier with each block. She passed the corner where men almost crashed and now they did crash because the tires skimmed on brine and they laughed, to their credit, and then they got angry at the brine itself. She passed the Library and the doors were sandbagged and Jun saucered a hand at her through the glass. She passed the yard and the cranes were sleeping like giant birds and Keziah looked up at the sky like maybe it would answer. It did not. It greyed.\n\nThe phone hissed. Her song had thirty thousand listens, then ninety, then a man called her a plague with a string of adjectives that had never been in the same sentence before. A girl wrote: I can hear my house in your voice. A woman wrote: I have a wrench in my drawer because of you. The city was a chorus of unpleasant sounds and here, threading between them, something else. She went up to her apartment and unrolled the rug and lay down on the cool floor. It was damp. She did not cry. The body keeps a calendar of its own.\n\nShe dreamed of Rowan sitting on the edge of the sink and humming something older than the registry. He dipped a spoon in the brine and made a face. \u201cToo sharp,\u201d he said. \u201cYour song could cut a lip.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt should,\u201d she said in the dream. \u201cMen say I have a mouth like a tool.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo let it be a tool,\u201d he said. \u201cUse it.\u201d\n\nShe woke to sirens describing circles. Outside a man was shouting that he had lost his hat. The sky had a color she couldn\u2019t name. Her phone had thirty messages, all of them from people who had never called before. Jun: I stole a boat. Keziah: The pumps aren\u2019t designed for vinegar. The registry: Congratulations, Trending. The foreman: You broke my sink with your song. A girl unknown: My dad threw your wrench line at me while he cried. Somewhere a wall of brine toppled; you could feel it if you paid attention. She put her hands on the wall and felt the whole building think.\n\nThe city felt like a cucumber, jarred, weighted by a lid too tight. The rockets loomed in her mind; she had always been suspicious of their promise because she\u2019d never been promised anything that large without a man bending the truth for it. She thought of Keziah\u2019s tools, the way her hands settled on a bolt like it was a sentence that needed a period. She thought of Jun\u2019s face behind the glass. She thought of Rowan\u2014the dreadful flaw they\u2019d turned into a law; the strange lunch; the way songs thread their way through a human the way water does through a city. The world was becoming acid, sharp, thoughtless. The men were rude and reckless because they had nothing else they knew how to be. The women were careful and tired. The children were juggling the stoppers because each small toss made gravity an agreement you could break.\n\nThat night the rain made a sound like someone was dialing. Orla sang softly, not a song for the registry but a prayer for plumbing, a hum she\u2019d learned under sinks, the way copper sings if you press your ear to it right. She sang for the brine because you can\u2019t curse water and then ask it to spare you. She sang for the men because someone should sing for those who shout. She sang for Keziah\u2019s pumps and for Jun\u2019s maps and for the rockets that might turn out to be real and useless or real and cruel or real and saving.\n\nThe power blinked. The radio coughed half a bulletin about evacuation zones, then changed its mind and told an old joke with a new accent. Orla stood at the window and watched the light in the yard go out, one-two-three, like someone counting backwards to something. She wanted Rowan\u2019s hand on her shoulder. She had only her own. That would have to be enough.\n\nMorning arrived like a question: are you still here? Are you still singing? She was. She did. She wouldn\u2019t stop, not now that the pipes knew her name. She went to the rocket yard because Keziah had texted no punctuation: come whenever come now. She went because Jun said she had a bag of maps and a boat was too slow. She went because the alley had made a sound at dawn like a throat clearing and then another sound like a door closing.\n\nThe men at the yard stood aside when Keziah waved, not because they had respect, not exactly, but because she had a mouth like a tool too. She had a clipboard. She had lines around her eyes that said she\u2019d done the hard thing you think about doing and then don\u2019t. \u201cThey\u2019ll open a slot for cargo,\u201d Keziah said. \u201cThey said emergency supplies. I said Yes, women, and they didn\u2019t argue because the pumps are sick and their wives are mad.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Jun?\u201d Orla asked.\n\n\u201cStealing the rest of the boat,\u201d Keziah said, and then she smiled sharply, like a bolt. \u201cYou look like a woman who ate a storm. I won\u2019t ask. We\u2019ll just do it. We\u2019ll do the next thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the next thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cLive show,\u201d Keziah said, pushing a crate of tubing toward a shadow. \u201cAt the yard. Tonight, before the surge. Sound like a good idea? No. Do it anyway. If there\u2019s a rocket, it should know your voice. If there\u2019s no rocket, we\u2019ll build one just to spite the men.\u201d\n\nThe brine pumps hiccuped; the yard sighed. Orla set down her wrench and tried to feel her own shoulder warm with her own hand. She asked the world to open another flaw just big enough to jam a song through. She did not think about eating. She did not think about the Chamber. She thought about Rowan humming under the sink. She thought about the men yelling, and she thought about the girl who had wrote and she could hear my house in your voice and she thought: I can hear it too.\n\nA child ran past with a red bucket, spilling water on his own shoes, laughing like a storm that forgot its schedule. A man cursed him and then gave him a high five because men are not made of only one thing; they are not cucumbers. The cranes creaked. The sky was the color of an old paper. The city held its breath, rude, reckless, waiting. Orla stood on the bucket arm and tested the mic she\u2019d rigged from parts of a broken radio and a damp extension cord. The sound skittered and then steadied. She nodded at Keziah. Jun arrived with a bundle of maps that looked like the belly of a big fish. \u201cYou look like a song,\u201d Jun said. \u201cDo it before the men remember how to interrupt.\u201d\n\nShe sang.\n\nAnd in a city full of elbows, the pipes said her name back to her, not because they were polite, no, but because even rude machines must hum along when a note is pure enough, and maybe because somewhere in their dark water someone had poured a little of Rowan Vale\u2019s voice, diluted and true, and the whole place had become a throat, and the throat was getting ready\u2014to swallow, to speak, to spit them out into whatever came next.The sound system they cobbled together out of a battered amp and a spool of marine cord did not look like it should carry a city, but it hummed itself into a mood anyway, the way a kettle turns water into insistence whether anyone asked it to or not. Keziah checked the grounding twice and then again, laying her palm on the metal like a blessing she would never call a blessing, only good practice. Jun spread a map across a crate and pinned it with wrenches. The paper curled with humidity, drawing itself into memory. Men on break drifted toward the bucket arm to see what the noise would be. They stood with arms crossed, which is how men armor themselves when nobody has issued weapons, and pretended to be doing inventory with their eyes. The cranes leaned in like tall old women listening at a fence.\n\nOrla cleared her throat and watched the wave of attention move through the yard the way ripples roll under oil. She could feel the song sitting behind her teeth like a held breath. The brine pumps somewhere below beat a steady wariness into the ground. She didn\u2019t believe in omens, just maintenance schedules; she believed in torque specifications and pipe dope and listening until the story arrived. But there was a charge in the air now as if the city had shucked its sweater and was watching to see who would notice. Keziah tossed her a cable tie and she fastened the mic to its stand with hands that remembered every guilty wrench she\u2019d ever tightened. Jun was all angles and patience at her shoulder, murmuring things in a different language\u2014the language of register entries and codes and the brittle poetry of bureaucrats who had not realized they were writing spells.\n\nThe first chord she sang sat wrong in the world and then righted itself. It was as if the ground tweaked a dial and said, Try again, sweetheart, I can take it. The men changed their feet. The bucket arm vibrated in a friendly way. A seagull made a sound like a curse and then adjusted to the new weather. Orla aimed the song at the pumps, at the fence, at the fat-bellied tanks that were supposed to be empty and weren\u2019t. The notes opened into each other like valves on a manifold. Her mouth felt like a tool because that\u2019s what it was; her body was a run of pipe moving water from one room to the next, or else it was a column of air elevated through a whistle. The chorus\u2014about the pipe wanting to shout\u2014came out less defiant this time and more instructional, a work order sung on purpose. When she let herself ease into the bridge she heard iron answer, and steel, and the two metals did not argue; they harmonized, old stubborn uncles at a table who turn out to like the same sauerkraut and remember the same river.\n\nJun\u2019s head came up like a compass needle. The map\u2019s threads\u2014the small pencil notations so faint she\u2019d brought a magnifying glass for them\u2014seemed to shift under her eyes. She touched a line that ran like a secret beneath three blocks of tenements and made a note with her thumbnail in the dust on the crate: \u201cSluice nine opens on E-flat.\u201d She glanced toward Keziah and got back the wide grin of a woman who has found the way to tell a turbine it is loved without getting her fingers eaten. Keziah had her hand on a breaker. Orla modulated an interval and a panel light on a pump control flickered, and the flicker was not random, and three men swore in the quiet surprise of people who have seen gears slip in and out of time.\n\nA memory rose like steam into Orla\u2019s mouth even as she sang. Rowan under the sink, saying that sound carried weight in places people didn\u2019t understand; that trains rattled nails loose in fence posts three towns over; that a human voice was a fine instrument but dangerous if you used the wrong note in the wrong room. He had meant this as gossip and warning both. He had meant it like a recipe he knew she would ignore and then learn the hard way. She tilted her voice to lay into the E that Jun\u2019s fingertip still hovered over and the smallest pump in a line of five thrummed as if it had decided to be a drum for a second and see how it felt.\n\nAttention, when it moves as one through a crowd, has a temperature. It went up a degree. Men straightened without meaning to. The boy from the pickle plant\u2014who had biked across town in a hairnet because he understood better than his foreman the gravity of a rumor\u2014clapped without smiling, as if not to scare the thing away. A foreman-type tried to elbow closer and found Keziah\u2019s punctual face in his path and backed up the way you do when the tool you wanted to misuse looks at you and suggests you put it down. Orla slid her resonance lower and felt the fence itself vibrate as if it were a diagram remembering it used to be a branch.\n\n\u201cLeft bank pressure drop,\u201d Jun said, voice flat like a diagnostic. \u201cWe\u2019re pulling something from somewhere. Or it\u2019s pulling us. Keep the E and add the B-flat, see if the old latches wake up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to break anything,\u201d Orla said at the edge of a line and then realized what a ridiculous sentence that was, how human, how much it smelled like fear disguised as responsibility.\n\n\u201cYou already did,\u201d Keziah said, affectionate, which would have hurt more if it had not settled like a reassurance. \u201cOn purpose. Keep going.\u201d\n\nShe sang around the note like a finger circling a glass. The sound came back strange and sweet because the world you sing into is not neutral; it is made of everything anyone has sung at it, ever. A hammer far off answered her with a ping. A pump added a beat. The old yard took a breath. And then the ground shifted, not the way an earthquake shifts\u2014sudden, teeth-rattling\u2014but the way a person clears a throat, prepares to speak, makes space for the body\u2019s own machinery. The brine under the city moved. You could feel it in your kneecaps if you bent them, and in the nails of your toes if you were barefoot on the bucket arm like maybe you shouldn\u2019t be. Phones bleeped. Someone said the word \u201cauthorization\u201d like a hiss, which meant systems were speaking to other systems in rooms without windows. Jun\u2019s lips shaped the old lazy code. Orla kept the E and added the B-flat.\n\nIn the municipal basement where all the pipes shook hands with all the other pipes in one ridiculous single-point-of-failure room, a relay clicked because twenty-seven years ago a technician with a sick child and a bad supervisor had told himself to remember to remove the testing module after the install and then had not remembered. The testing module had a microphone. The microphone had an algorithm. The algorithm had an if clause nobody had ever commented properly. It had been asleep through three administrations and a flood. It dreamed only of tones. It woke. It compared Orla to a set of samples nobody ever admitted were samples. It smiled the way a machine does when a condition resolves.\n\nOverride in effect, it told the gate inside the code. The gate sighed. The city took that breath it had been building.\n\nBrine does not ask permission of the people who live above it. Brine is a plan you made fifty years ago and forgot to put on the calendar; brine is a debt someone else incurred and your floor pays. It started to move toward the place Jun\u2019s pencil called Sluice Nine. It did not rush like a hero or slide like a thief; it rolled in its own time, wincing around constrictions, humming where the walls were smooth. Orla could feel the difference between concrete poured in 1934 and concrete poured in 2002 because the sound pinged back through the notes like light changing in water. She felt, too, the place where the wall had been patched and the patch had refused to marry the old material. She sent the B-flat there with a little extra friction in it, so the wall would remember the joint was a friendship to renew, not a sullen truce.\n\nA man made of clipboard and authority appeared at the end of the yard, the kind of man who acts like his shoes are better because they are on his feet. He had a mask around his neck he had no intention of wearing, and three other men arranged themselves at his corners so if he moved he would always have a shadow handy. He waved. He didn\u2019t wave to greet; he waved like a cop does in a lane of traffic. Keziah did not see him on purpose. Jun saw him without indicating she had. Orla did not stop singing because stopping is a way to say sorry and she was not sorry.\n\nThe clipboard man announced something toward the room, a sound that would have been sooner and louder in a building with more wall. Orla caught \u201cunauthorized\u201d on a curve and \u201ccease-and\u201d before she bent that vowel into a \u201cplease.\u201d It felt maybe not like power but like correct work. The men who had been pretending not to listen now pretended to be listening to the man because it is hard to stop being polite to things that have uniforms. Keziah flicked her hand and a breaker whispered and the speaker warmed a status light, which was not related to the clipboard man at all and felt better than listening to his paper.\n\nJun folded the map on two lines and handed Orla a look that was a plan. \u201cSluice Nine goes under the civic traffic circle and lets into the old canal cut. The canal cut knows the river. The river knows the sea. Your note knows the latch. If we open Nine, we can steer the first surge where the bones of the city remember boats. We\u2019ll drown a little less.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do we drown instead?\u201d Orla asked, because scars like to be counted.\n\n\u201cThe tourist mall and the men who pretend they built it,\u201d Jun said without heat, then added, softer, \u201cand three streets of small shops, and a church basement I like that smells like old noodles, and a bank that deserves worse. But if we don\u2019t open anything, it\u2019s the schools. It\u2019s the beds in the apartment houses. It\u2019s the pickle plant and everyone who works there. It\u2019s the Library.\u201d\n\nOrla had not been taught to choose who gets wet. She was a plumber; she was taught you fix the pipe. Her throat made a sound that was almost not music and she could feel in the ground Sluice Nine leaning in the way a person leans when someone calls their name across a crowded room. She pictured the church basement, the noodles, the bank with its mouth full of rules, the mall where the girls practiced different lives in the mirror of expensive glass. She thought about how the Library had been sandbagged, its windows defiant. She thought about hands on maps, hands on bolts, hands on her back. She angled the E a fraction and thought of Rowan saying We can make a legal trick look like love and love look like a legal trick, and how angry it had made her at the table, and how true it was now that the world was sloppy with brine.\n\nThe clipboard man spoke louder and closer, as if decibels could do the job that patience usually does. He said there were laws. He said there were protocols. He began a sentence that included the word \u201chysteria\u201d and then stopped not because he had had a revelation about his use of language but because Keziah\u2019s wrench, with a carelessness she lent to it, dropped from the handrail next to him and bit the concrete with a tone that made the bones in every listening person\u2019s ear growl a warning. It wasn\u2019t a threat. It was a tuning note. The clipboard man adjusted his tie and said, \u201cYou will be held responsible,\u201d which sounded almost like an admission of his own helplessness when you scraped the paint off.\n\nOrla didn\u2019t answer. She sang the phrase that had lived under the wrench chorus like a backbone. The bucket arm carried it; the amp broke it into square waves and glued it back together. The world did not reject it. Somewhere under the traffic circle\u2014under the bronzed statue of a man with a heroic elbow and a horse that never learned to be a horse\u2014an old sluice gate remembered how to do what gates do: take orders. It had been kept mostly shut for a hundred and three years by an arrangement of rust and ceremony. The rust had stronger arguments than the ceremony most days. Today the ceremony carried a voice with it that the rust recognized from a time before the registry, before the map, before the city signed and sealed its own forgetting.\n\nSluice Nine opened the way you open your jaw when a doctor says \u201cwider.\u201d It creaked in a language Orla could nearly translate with her tongue against her teeth. It let old water rush through its ribs, and the water wore a new suit. Aboveground, the traffic circle made a noise like someone finding out that their favorite bridge will hold a thousand more cars than posted and deciding to test it. The horses\u2019 ears rang. The heroic elbow pointed west. The brine took the hint and rolled toward the canal cut like a guest who was late for a train.\n\nThe men in the yard swayed as if they were on deck. The clipboard man swore his most clerical swear; it did not change anything about the way gravity had chosen to behave. Keziah laughed because she could see, in the sudden drop in suction, the way the pumps were no longer drinking their own bathwater. Jun sat down, quick, like she had been keeping the city on her shoulders and only remembered that she had knees when Grief took a hand off the load. Orla felt the E settle in her chest into something nearly comfortable. She wanted to vomit and dance, the way you want to after narrowly missing a ladder with your temple and then realizing every step you take forever will be a prayer you don\u2019t have to say aloud.\n\nNews moves like mold on bread when the conditions are right. In the space before the next verse, the registry\u2019s little green light hiccuped and sprayed her name and the name of the song across a thousand screens as if that would protect anyone. A man with a microphone somewhere said her name wrong in an urgent nice tone. A woman with a good haircut mentioned \u201cunauthorized sonic intervention\u201d with admiration the camera did not allow. A boy in a basement ripped the song from the feed and autoloaded it into a mixer he\u2019d pirated from a forum moderated by a person named Milkcap. A girl in a small room hummed the E without knowing why and a spill of tea popped with surprise on a saucer.\n\nThe surge took the canal bed with more dignity than anyone had predicted. The old cut had been sleeping\u2014but not dead, not as long as maps keep their breath\u2014and the banks gave with a sound like open arms. The mall, which had always pretended to be made of leisure and glass, showed how quickly a stage becomes a bathtub. Escalators became waterfalls without needing permission from their board of directors. Shops released scented candles into a world that was too busy to be soothed. A security guard shepherded teenagers onto a bench as if boarding dogs in a storm, counted three heads he was not responsible for and felt responsible anyway, sent a text to a mother whose number he did not know to say These kids are okay. He did not include punctuation because his hands had finally decided to shake.\n\nAt the Library, the sandbags settled in their seams and the glass bowed and held like a good argument. Jun\u2019s boss, who had said \u201cno politics on the desk\u201d for three years and meant it, unlocked the door and stood in the vestibule with a mop like a spear and cried quietly because the maps were safe for this minute. At the pickle plant, the foreman was too busy not drowning to misname anyone, which felt like a miracle and a loss. The boy with the hairnet climbed onto a rack and sang three words of Orla\u2019s chorus because the pipe wanted to shout and who was he to tell it not to.\n\nThe yard breathed again in a different direction. Relief has a noise. So does horror when it glances up and remembers it will be back in a minute. The clipboard man tried again, like a metronome whacking its head against the wrong tempo. He told them to stop; he told them to continue at a reduced volume; he told them they had done enough; he told them they had done too much; he told them he would make a report; he told them he already had. The men around him looked at each other and then at Orla and then at the floor because sometimes respect arrives at the room without an invitation and you don\u2019t know what to do with your face. Keziah unplugged something not useful and plugged something else useful in its place, and when the clipboard man stepped too close, she gave him the smile of someone who has removed her own tooth, alone, and knows where every emergency shutoff valve in a three-mile radius is, and he remembered an appointment.\n\nJun collected her map and rolled it with tender cruelty. \u201cWe can buy time,\u201d she said into Orla\u2019s shoulder as if talking to a carefully tuned harp. \u201cWe can\u2019t buy forgiveness. That will be collected later by whatever survives. We should find Nine and see if it sticks or if it needs a wedge. We should also eat saltines because my hands are shaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could eat a river,\u201d Orla said, which was the sort of joke you do not want to make anymore but couldn\u2019t help making because your mouth has a habit of trying to save your head.\n\n\u201cYou ate a river,\u201d Keziah said lightly, and then made her own joke heavy. \u201cAnd men will say you caused it because you were the weather they saw when they finally paid attention, but they\u2019d be wrong and they\u2019ll say it anyway. Let\u2019s move. The yard will keep. These cranes know their own names.\u201d\n\nThey moved through a city reorganizing itself around them with the authority of water. Streets had edges they had not had in the morning. A man sat on his stoop with his shoes set two steps higher than his feet, saving them as if they were friends too cowardly to wait out the rain and he forgave them. A woman waded with a bundle held high that could have been laundry or a dog or both, singing something that might have been Orla\u2019s E or might have been something older and better. Cars did the thing cars do when they become boats, which is to pretend for a minute and then sink. They cut across a parking lot where lines made sense and then didn\u2019t. They found the traffic circle choked with the raucous litter of modernity\u2014delivery scooters upended like small casualties, an advertisement for whitening teeth torn into a shape that looked like a flag for a country with poor taste and a lot of money. The bronze man and horse had not moved; they never do; they had acquired algae like a borrowed mustache.\n\nThe grate that led to Nine lay under a tide of cigarettes and promises. Jun knelt with that careful contempt librarians save for box cutters. She had a flat pry bar in her bag next to a stapler and a flashlight with a lens so polished it remembered astronomy. Keziah stood watch like a bouncer at the doorway of a club for tired women with better things to do than dance. Orla wanted to apologize to the gate and the brine and the statue and the pigeons and then she realized she would be apologizing until she starved and put her hands into work instead. The grate did not want to come up because of pride, then because of habit, then because a bolt had seized into itself and become creed. Jun loosened the belief with the pry bar. Keziah leaned into the weight with her shoulder like she had leaned into men all her life until they made way because there was nothing else they knew how to do with being pushed by a woman who would not make a scene after she made the scene. The grate sighed. These sounds were the city\u2019s new vocabulary, and Orla was fluent in them whether she liked it or not.\n\nBelow, Sluice Nine was not picturesque. Nine was a jaw with molars. Nine had a hinge that had not been tender to for a century. Nine had a chain like a memory of a necklace. Orla could feel the note it liked before she heard it. She could tell the shape of the rust with the back of her tongue. When she sang again there, the world lost the polite acoustics of the yard and became useful again: tight, rough, responsive. The sound travelled like gossip through a family that has been meeting at the same table since before the oldest aunt can recall her own wedding. Nine creaked further, and the water shouldered through like an aunt with elbows in a grocery store aisle. It bulled toward the cut, which was honoring its old agreements with gravity.\n\nA rusted pin protested in a register Orla felt in her knuckles. Jun swore librarian-swears and located the pin by the map of its sound. Keziah put a wrench on it and then put herself on the wrench until stubbornness recognized a cousin and gave way. The pin slid like a grudge being admitted. The water\u2019s tone changed, dropping from a dangerous adolescent laugh into a risky adult murmur. Jun whistled. Keziah whistled. Orla tried not to cry at the sight of ordinary women making a machine be reasonable. Up above, sirens did their endless circles like badly trained tide.\n\nThey did not get long without men with badges and men with papers. They arrived together, as if some high office had finally dusted its intercom and pressed \u201cALL-CALL.\u201d The badges wanted to control crime; the papers wanted to control narrative; neither wanted to get their shoes wet, but both did. The first man down the steps had a posture like a fencepost and the polite-and-tired look of a person whose daughter had texted him twice a heart and he had written back \u201cbe safe\u201d and meant \u201cI am sorry I wasn\u2019t better earlier when it was easy.\u201d He did not tell them to stop. He asked, \u201cWhat is the goal?\u201d as if he would be seen by his peers asking and that counted as work too. Jun told him numbers. Keziah told him the names of parts. Orla told him a note.\n\nThe men with papers were more excitable. They had phrases ready to be poured into the mold of this moment and they poured them: unauthorized, incitement, crowd control, municipal sabotage, domestic sound-terrorism, precedent. The phrases were sour as if they had been bottled badly. One of them recognized Orla because face-recognition is the sport of men who do not lift anything heavier than a phrase and he said, \u201cYou are the one,\u201d and that made Orla laugh harder than she meant to because none of the ones are one, and she said so in a voice that thinned to wire. He wrote \u201cdenies accountability\u201d in a notebook that would never be read by anyone but him standing in a bathroom making himself feel full.\n\nThe badge with the fencepost spine looked at the canal cut which was doing its best to be a river and then at the women and then at his shoes which were now honestly ruined. \u201cIf you can keep it there,\u201d he said slowly, as if he were tamping down gravel one shovelful at a time, \u201cwe can use the old tide gate as a throat. We can angle the surge into the shipyard basin. The basin is ugly and empty and made of sins instead of people. We can empty the sin for once. But the tide gate needs a song nobody remembers. The controller is in a room with a lock that believes in itself more than almost anything I\u2019ve met.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know its mother,\u201d Jun said. \u201cBring me to the lock.\u201d\n\nThey went, leaving men to guard Nine who would never be thanked for doing it well and would be marched through a debrief if they did it badly. The city\u2019s breath was steady enough to run. Keziah jogged in her boots like a person who has never fallen because confidence has a mass and moves obstacles aside. Jun held the map like a baby, which is to say with the lack of ceremony that can look cold if you do not understand love as maintenance. Orla kept the E in her throat as if the second she dropped it the world would crash to the floor and spill like an armful of dishes.\n\nThe tide gate sat in a building that had wanted to be beautiful and had instead grown useful and then unkind. The lock on its door had the particular prickliness of a thing that had been spared budget cuts by being invisible. Jun crouched and took out two tools that looked like science and a third that was just a hairpin with a grudge. Keziah watched the room. Orla sang under her breath to the keyway and felt the pins inside blink awake as if stared at. Jun did not open it with magic. She opened it with patience and the small amount of luck you get if you bother to carry a hairpin long enough. Inside, the control panel was older than the badge-man had expected and younger than Jun liked. The label on its corner was the name of a man who had been elected twice and then told his mistress to evacuate while his wife loaded the car with soup, and Orla hated that she knew that and hated more that knowing did not help anyone.\n\nThe controller had a port labeled VOX as if it had always known what it wanted in its mouth. Jun glanced at Orla with a look that asked for apology in advance. Orla put her lips near the port like she was going to kiss the thing and instead sang the E she had been nursing as if it were a colicky infant finally ready to burp. The panel lit with a color that meant nothing in the manual and everything in the room, and the code that had been asleep downstairs sent a cousin here that agreed with it, and the tide gate said yes with a frankness that made Orla shut her eyes because those yeses are not free and must be paid for somehow later when no one is still sweaty from saving things.\n\nThey opened the throat of the basin and the brine went there as if it had been the plan all along, sliding greedily around pilings built for men who had stopped believing they would ever build ships again and had hung their hats on the yard like a child hanging a wish on a hook. The basin filled with other people\u2019s errors. The tide outside argued and then accommodated because tides are realists. The pumps in the yard smiled in relief the way a body does at a cough that finally clears the fool film from your lungs. Somewhere blocks away, women put down their buckets and redistributed their blankets and had the kind of laugh that is not joy but is its wise cousin.\n\nAfter, the yard had the woozy look of a room after a fight where nobody knows exactly who got punched, only that everybody did. Men sat on crates and did not talk. The clipboard man had left to be sanctimonious somewhere dry. The fencepost badge called his daughter and left a voicemail in which he did not say everything he meant and said more than he was allowed. Keziah leaned on a pillar and let her head hang forward the way you do when you are trying to talk your spine into being friends again. Jun wrote down the shape of the day on the back of an old flier for a community meeting about \u201cStormwater Management: Our Shared Future,\u201d drawing arrows like tiny admonitions to time. Orla sat on the bucket arm and put her hand behind her own neck and thought about how skin has gears, too.\n\nThe messages on her phone had become a pile she wanted to push off a table into a bag. There were girls with wrenches typed in emoji line-ups; there were men inventing cosmologies in which she was the jealous goddess of their impediments; there were grandmothers telling her their sinks sang to them that morning; there was the boy with the hairnet\u2019s mother, who wrote in a voice too precise to be anything but poor and careful: I do not know your name but you sound like the one who reminds us where we put things down. There was also the Registry, which had moved past Congratulations and landed on Please attend for compliance, and then further to We require in-person clarification, and underneath that the whisper in the code that Jun had found smoking in the stacks: override.gatekeep = false, which looked even more like church in the glow of emergency.\n\n\u201cThey will come for you politely,\u201d Jun said out of nowhere, as if reading text upside down is a thing librarians are born knowing how to do. \u201cThey will smile with their teeth and say that safety is the milk in which we all float. They will say trend spikes are unpredictable. They will say you are dangerous not because you can ruin things but because you can choose not to ruin them, and they did not plan for that when they built the ruin.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a rocket,\u201d Keziah said, half a joke and half not. \u201cWe can leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a city,\u201d Orla said, and it came out more like a promise than she expected and scared her a little because promises have back-edges.\n\nThey did not leave. They ate crackers Jun had stolen from a storage room in the Library where the emergency kits had expired last summer and no one had found the budget to replace them. They drank water that tasted like coins, which at least did not taste like pickles. They stood under a yard light that clicked like tired eyelids coming to attention. Men passed by and did not interfere because sometimes the momentum of their own rudeness leaves them behind if the current is strong enough. Orla\u2019s song played in a hundred kitchens on phones hanging from nails above sinks. The chorus got misremembered in one neighborhood in a way that made it better. A girl in a stairwell between two lives practiced the line about the tool-mouth and found out what her jaw could do.\n\nNight in a city that has just decided to continue is not restful. It is a negotiation you keep having with every surface. Orla dozed and woke and checked the tone in the yard and dozed and dreamed she was a pipe with a name and a birthday and woke to find she was just a woman with a wrench and a mouth and a history, which was both more and less consoling. Keziah kept watch with a posture she denied was duty. Jun wrote a letter she would never be allowed to send, only show to women who came after to lower their blood pressure and raise their courage.\n\nToward the small hour, a truck without markings arrived at the gate, and the men who had been hardened by everything except boredom lifted their heads as if they had smelled an invoice. The truck\u2019s doors opened with the sound of an expensive zipper. Three people climbed out, wearing the same face in different proportions: we are not here to arrest you; we are here to bring you into the process; there is a room with chairs and you can bring a friend. They had on shoes that believe in climate control. One woman among them wore a lanyard like a rosary and smiled in the way of a person who has been promoted for making difficult people feel heard. She looked at Orla, then at Keziah, then at Jun, and chose a tone that would not wake a baby.\n\n\u201cMs. Vale,\u201d she said, getting the name right because someone had briefed her while her car rolled through three neighborhoods full of water. \u201cWhat an extraordinary day. We will need to debrief this both administratively and visionary-wise. There are liabilities and there is an opportunity to ensure the safety story is correctly communicated. We want to give you a platform. We also need to make sure your content pipeline\u201d\u2014she did not hear her own pun\u2014\u201cis aligned with stakeholder parameters.\u201d\n\nJun made a small choking noise that in another room would have been a laugh. Keziah\u2019s shoulder shifted away from the pillar as if it had more to do. Orla put her hands on the bucket arm and felt the machine purr with the residual of a day spent useful. She thought how the lanyard woman\u2019s voice had no brine in it, and how much she trusted voices that smelled like new plastic less than voices that smelled like vinegar and dust. She thought of Rowan drawing a little diagram on his death note and telling her to make it blessed and hating the world and loving her. She wanted to throw a wrench. She wanted to hug someone. She wanted to sleep in a pipe.\n\n\u201cI will come,\u201d she said, mouth quiet, the way you tell a valve to move and it moves because you did not beg it. \u201cBut not tonight. You will give me tomorrow morning and you will not, after I leave, hurt the men who kept Sluice Nine open with their legs and their boredom. You will not take Jun\u2019s maps or pretend they were yours. You will not call Keziah\u2019s cranes assets as if their worth resides in your spreadsheet. You will not say the word hysteria in a room with my name in it again. You will, if you own the mall where we sent the brine, open your doors to the church basement with the noodles. You will also\u201d\u2014she put her hand on the amp, and the amp hummed as if to say I\u2019m listening\u2014\u201cdelete a line of code that should never have been eating its lunch in a government building.\u201d\n\nThe lanyard did not ruffle. She was good at not ruffling. \u201cWe can discuss,\u201d she said, professional as paper. \u201cWe can absolutely calendar a hackathon moment around the legacy stack. We appreciate your passion. Tomorrow morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cTen,\u201d Jun said, because nine sounded like early and sexy and they deserved neither.\n\n\u201cTen-thirty,\u201d Keziah said, because ten would feel like a concession and she was not in the mood to concede in any measurable way.\n\n\u201cTen-fifteen,\u201d the lanyard said, which would have been funny if they had all not been so tired that laughter would have broken something important.\n\nThey left. The truck\u2019s zipper was smug. The yard lifted its shoulders and let them relax like an animal lying down after a long conversation. The pumps ticked in their casings like hearts counting gratitude. Orla sat back and let her spine inform her of its boundaries. Keziah took Orla\u2019s wrist in a hand that could tighten a bolt without thinking and placed her fingers where a pulse happens, and made a face that said, There you are, and then looked away because she respected privacy. Jun leaned her head on Orla\u2019s other shoulder in a way that said, I will be your north again in the morning, but for now we are a weather system.\n\nWhen dawn turned the cranes into spider skeletons against a pale sky, the city smelled less like pickles and more like a kitchen after a party. There is a sweetness to mess when the worst did not happen. Orla answered three messages that mattered and one that didn\u2019t but would have nagged her. She wrote down things she did not want to remember later as if writing them would make them less true. She tucked a thread of hair behind her ear and felt the thin red string Keziah had tied there in the Chamber and made herself not touch it twice like a superstition. She went to the fence and looked east and west and then down because below is always where the story grows. She thought of the registry with its backdoor still ajar and wondered if a city could be taught to keep open a flaw on purpose.\n\nWhen the morning arrived in full and the men restarted their machines and the women checked their buckets and the children, who had not known they were children until they were told to stay out of the way, checked each other for bravery, Orla put her wrench on her shoulder and went to meet the people who say platform when they mean leash. On the way, a girl on a stoop said without greeting, \u201cMy sink doesn\u2019t sulk today,\u201d and Orla said, \u201cGood,\u201d and they both understood this for what it was, a small strong sentence that might hold if you did not ask it to carry too much.\n\nThe municipal building had air that tasted like an old office. It had floors that were not wet. It had a receptionist who looked at Orla the way a person looks at a raincoat with interesting mud and decided not to be surprised. The conference room looked like every conference room and also like the inside of a mollusk and also like a waiting room for pretend. Men in shirts arrived with clipboards and word habits. Women in shirts arrived and put pens into notebooks with stubborn courtesy. The lanyard looked as composed as a well-watered plant. The chair at the head of the table was bigger in some infinitesimal way; it had a back that implied moral structure. A man with hair like a confidence trick filled it.\n\nHe said her name correctly, and then he said his own four times in two sentences because his name had cost him money and he wanted to make sure the room earned it for him. He told her of risk and of rumor and of APIs. He told her the registry was not meant as a pioneering platform. He told her grandfather stories from a city he had not lived in, because men in his chair often collect old tales like lucky coins. He told her that there would need to be a song coordination procedure and that public harm had to be measured in units that could fit onto a graph. He was very reasonable for a long time and Orla listened because listening is a tool as sharp as any and you can shave a sheep with it if the sheep lets you.\n\nWhen he stopped, the room was not open but had the feeling of a lid you could loosen with heat. Jun took a breath that meant a footnote was coming with teeth. Keziah put her palm flat on the table and smiled with no warmth at all. Orla looked at the lanyard woman because at least she had been honest about wanting to calendar things. Then she spoke in a tone she had used to teach a pipe it was time to shut up.\n\n\u201cYou built a gate that asked for old signatures instead of new money,\u201d she said. \u201cYou built that because someone told you the city was supposed to be like a family and you didn\u2019t ask which parts of family are worth carrying forward and which are worth letting die. I sang through it because you will not hire a woman who does not speak like a man, and because my grandfather is dead and I let him be useful one more time and because this place was drowning in vinegar like a joke. I will not pretend I did not use a trick. But you will not call it a trick and turn away from the river I moved.\u201d\n\nThe chair man smiled in a way he believed was reassuring. \u201cWe can harness your enthusiasm. We can embed a vetting layer. We can integrate your talent into a safer design.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to make a room I cannot enter without holding someone\u2019s hand,\u201d Orla said, and laughed because the image was poor and too true. \u201cI will continue to sing. You will remove the line that says I cannot unless a ghost touches my throat. You will train your machines to recognize that safety sounds different from obedience. And we will build a thing that listens to women at the hinge, not only at the ribbon-cutting.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are describing a governance challenge,\u201d he said, Polite in Chief, and Jun made a noise that was very close to a bird of prey.\n\n\u201cShe is describing a city,\u201d Keziah said, leaning in as if to make a deal with the table. \u201cDo not mistake the two because you live in one more than the other.\u201d\n\nThey haggled. The haggling had equations in it, and grudges, and some glitter. Men used words like \u201cpilot\u201d and \u201csprint\u201d and \u201cbeta\u201d as if they were saints; women used words like \u201cdoor\u201d and \u201cdrain\u201d and \u201cday\u201d as if a noun could be a hammer. At the end somebody had changed a policy and somebody had not admitted it. At the end there was paper that could be waved. At the end the lanyard looked lighter and the chair man looked like a man who, if you tipped his head, would run out of adjectives for out-of-scope. At the end Orla felt old and new at once, which was either victory or the way your muscles feel after you carry an awkward thing up a narrow staircase.\n\nOutside, the city reeked and glittered and yelled. The basin held. The canal murmured. Sluice Nine watched like an old cat on a radiator, pretending to be asleep and listening to everything. The rockets, which had in the night been defended by a small army of women who pretended they were only passing by, held their tongues. Jun went to the Library to bully a copier whose drum had decided to produce ghosts. Keziah went to weld a seam on a pump housing and wrote Orla\u2019s name in her head in a way she would deny. Orla went to the Pickling Works because even miracle days have invoices.\n\nThe foreman met her with a damp towel over his shoulder and two names for her, neither of which were hers. He apologized with a ferocity that was either genuine or habit and for once it didn\u2019t matter. He pointed at a sink that had sulked through panic and now refused to be civil. Orla got under it because sometimes your medicine is just doing the job you know how to do and letting the faucet look back at you as if you were the only person who knew where its threads had gone. The pipes there made sounds like the aftertaste of vinegar, and she sweetened them with tape and patience until they swallowed their own bile. The boy with the hairnet applauded once. The foreman said, \u201cYou made the mall into a river,\u201d as if he had just remembered her other job. She asked for double. He paid triple because men, like pumps, sometimes work better if you trick their pride into doing the right thing.\n\nOn the way home, girls had written her chorus in chalk on a wall as if to remind the building it had a mouth. Someone had hung from a window a banner that said in unwieldy spraypaint WE ARE NOT PICKLES and attached three hearts and a wrench. The city had not become polite. It had not become gentle. A man still shoved another man with his shoulder at the light because we are so old, all of us, and we return to our old small violences out of habit. But the gutters sang less brokenly in that moment. The ducts had moods and today they were less sullen. A child was teaching a smaller child to juggle rubber stoppers without dropping any because you can rehearse gravity and still not keep it from laughing.\n\nThat night, when the dark pressed the sky to the shape of the cranes again, Orla sat on her floor and let the tiles cool the backs of her arms. She put the wrench down where she could reach it and did not reach for it. She sang very quietly a new line\u2014something that had come into her mouth at the tide gate and burned a little\u2014about families we are born into and systems we inherit and which ones we are willing to cook down into ghosts and which ones we want to build sidewalks for. She did not record it. She did not send it to anyone. She let it hang above her bed like a leak you are not afraid of because you know where the valve is. Eventually she slept. In the hallway outside, someone\u2019s radio murmured a news voice that had learned the difference between weather and consequences. Somewhere in the basement of the municipal building a programmer got in trouble for a comment he had not left in code and did not understand what for. Somewhere at the edge of the salt flats the cranes settled their steel and pretended they were birds in a story written by a city that had decided, this one time, to listen.Chapter 5\n\nTwo mornings later the city smelled like a refrigerator a week after a party, sweet and suspicious and full of leftovers you could either make into a meal or regret. The gutters still sang but they had relearned a bar of politeness, a rounded vowel at the end of each gurgle, as if the ducts had slept and woken up with better manners. Men on corners argued the way men do when a story has already been told and they\u2019re trying to figure out how to edit themselves into it; each of them had told the brine where to go, apparently, and several had personally authorized Sluice Nine. Women counted towels that would never be the same color again and wrote their names inside rubber boots with permanent marker because institutions will borrow your dignity along with your gear. Orla\u2019s throat felt like she had swallowed a small river stone and it was taking its time deciding whether to stay. When she laughed, which happened twice for real and three times in defense, she tasted Rowan\u2019s salt and some newer sharpness that was not the city\u2019s and not wholly hers.\n\nThe ten-fifteen did not move, which felt like an omen for once in her favor. They put her in a room with walls as smooth as a lie and power outlets at shoulder-height and a bowl of fruit that had been arranged by a man who had never had to save a banana from his children. The lanyard woman smiled with fatigue and skill and introduced a man whose job title had more slashes than bones. They said words that were blunt and slippery in the same breath. There would be a Tone Permitting framework, a Vox Credential issued per decibel class, a Civic Phonetics Council with a subcommittee on Urban Acoustical Ethics, which is to say they would build a gate and paint it a color everyone liked. Jun sat very straight and asked to see the code. Someone said of course. Someone said later. Keziah inspected the ceiling because it is reassuring to have a ceiling to blame. Orla remembered why Rowan hated committees and loved women who kept their own lists.\n\nThat afternoon the backdoor did not so much get removed as pried up and told to stop being coy. Jun used a form she had found that was improperly retired and filed an emergency change request on a holiday weekend that did not exist. The city clerk in charge of refusing such things had a grandmother who sang in a church basement that still smelled like noodles; he signed. A programmer named Dylan with a coffee stain where his courage should have been sat between two monitors and performed a small, modest surgery, supervised in absentia by the invisible pressure of Jun\u2019s eyebrows and the note Orla hummed into his voicemail by accident when she forgot not to sing to machines. The line with the lazy if fell. A second line blinked, a cousin, an older sibling really, buried in an ancient library stack nobody had dusted since the scandal with the sewage bonds. Jun found that one too, and for the first time all week she laughed without sounding like she was filing a complaint with God.\n\nWith the gate no longer a family heirloom, the men invented three new gates and a list of exceptions. The registrar drafted a glossary that made singing sound like a crime. The city posted an advisory asking residents to refrain from \u201cunscheduled tonal manipulations\u201d during peak hours, which was a phrase that lived for one day and died in ridicule. Orla didn\u2019t wait for definitions. She borrowed a school gym that had lost two tiles to the brine and laid out tape in a circle like a ritual she refused to name. She invited the plumbers she liked and the aunties with deep voices and the teenage choir from the church with the noodles, and she told the boys who juggled stoppers they could come if they kept their hands still until she said otherwise. The flyer the city printed for it was branded SOUND INFRASTRUCTURE WORKSHOP and had a graphic of a microphone wearing a hardhat; somebody\u2019s uncle shared it with an eye-roll that made it into a challenge. The room filled with throats and lungs and clocks in sternum bones that had been keeping time for other people too long. Orla tuned them like she would an old manifold: gently, with a wrench she wanted to call patience and could not.\n\nIn the yard, the pumps learned the names of the women who walked past them. Keziah caught a cavitation before it could pockmark a vane and kissed her teeth, the only kissing she allowed herself in public that day. The men up the chain accelerated a test schedule that had been hypothetical since Orla had braids because nothing gets men moving like the chance to make lightning look obedient. They wanted a static fire because the words made them feel like gods in clean shirts. Keziah set her jaw and ticked boxes with the precision of a surgeon who will not remove the wrong organ no matter how many men mispronounce it. Orla climbed the catwalk and felt the motor bearings through the metal with the balls of her feet. She sang to the coupling because it had a headache and the headache was going to cost money. Halfway through the note the platform twitched and someone shouted and she couldn\u2019t see who threw the arm around her waist\u2014the world moved and Keziah\u2019s breath was in her ear and then the platform did not move, because love can be a good hand on your belt and nobody needs to call it love in that second if the word will make anyone clumsy.\n\nThe backlash arrived like a truck backing into a wall\u2014slow, loud, inevitable, late. A man on the radio with the old voice of certainty called her a siphon witch and invited donations. Someone with a magazine subscription wrote a profile with the headline SIREN SYNDROME and spelled her name right with the same energy as spitting. Under a picture of Rowan chromed into a saint without his permission, a columnist wrote sentences that had seventeen commas and no heart. The file from the Library developed a rumor of itself; people called consumption in italics as if italics could keep their own hands clean. The only piece of mail that made her sit down came in a blue envelope and had no return address. Inside was a picture of a girl with a wrench on her shoulder, drawn in crayon, and underneath it in shy unjoined letters: Thank you for getting the water out of my grandma\u2019s kitchen. She put the drawing on the wall above the radio and the news anchor stared daggers at it every night and lost.\n\nThey went to the church basement because the best acoustics in the city are where the ceilings are low and the soup was always meant to be shared. The choir in the room was not a choir the way men define choirs when they\u2019re funding them; it was a group of throats that had learned to hold things. The pastor nodded with the particular pride of someone whose building had chosen not to drown out of respect. The older women sang notes that had vacations and wars in them, that had tomato skins and chain mail and lullabies the singer didn\u2019t like but sang anyway. Orla stood back and counted reasons to cry and sang instead. A girl with a braid almost too tight to breathe asked, at the end, if the tool-mouth line meant you had to be mean to get things to behave. Orla said, only if they mistake being specific for cruelty, and the girl nodded as if she\u2019d suspected that for a while and was relieved to have permission to stop apologizing.\n\nJun\u2019s superiors called a meeting about her conduct that sounded like a request for a recipe and felt like an audit. They had found out about the file only after people in departments that never visited the same restroom argued over who should have access to the word \u201cancestral\u201d in budget requests. The room had two plants and no water and four kinds of fear in it. Jun wore a shirt that took no sides and put her bag on the table as if to remind them she carried things that would outlive their titles. She explained\u2014with the patience of an archivist teaching someone to read a pencil annotation without smearing it\u2014the difference between the records we admit and the records that admit us. A man asked if she had a written policy for choosing when to rescue a city. She said, Yes, but no one has printed it. When they told her she could either be reprimanded or promoted into a role called Strategic Heritage Data she laughed like a paper cut and took the promotion because if you have to lose blood do it where the stains will be visible to the next woman who comes through with a Sharpie.\n\nThe forecast went back to promising comfort in the future tense and delivering damp in the present. A plant upriver burped an apology in the form of a lime spill and the water got teeth you couldn\u2019t see. Orla and the choir of wet things tested a chord that would keep the pH knives from finding the undersides of pipes we needed and the ankles of kids we loved. The aunties held an A-sharp the way they hold a baby\u2019s name and refuse to let it be mispronounced; the teenagers made a harmony that slid like oil without doing harm; the plumbers, bless them, sang ugly and correct and on time. They stood in three basements no one had cared to inventory and moved a problem around the room until it settled into a corner that could bear it. Men would later say there had been no emergency. That is how you know the right women showed up.\n\nBetween storms the rocket yard tried on its destiny like a suit it loved and could not afford. Men in hats came from a dry city to inspect without offering to carry. They asked Keziah if she wanted to be saved from her own competence by a job in a place where the pumps didn\u2019t know her name. They offered benefits that looked like bracelets from across a room. She washed her hands in a sink that spat at her and said she had work here while looking at Orla like deciding not to look was a skill she wasn\u2019t practicing this afternoon. That night, above the basin that was still swallowing other people\u2019s sins, they walked the catwalk without touching elbows. The cranes made a noise like old gods settling their spines and Keziah said, easy, like the city was a dog worth keeping. Orla nearly said stay and did not. She said, If you leave I\u2019ll learn how to fix big pumps without you, which was a love letter written in the dialect of stubbornness. Keziah laughed because she heard it.\n\nBack in the Pickling Works, the foreman\u2019s mouth remembered the shape of Orla\u2019s name and his pride put a hat on to come out in public. He didn\u2019t stop being himself; he just did it with less vinegar. He paid early once and pretended it was because accounting had a new girl. The boy with the hairnet had become a boy with a checklist and he had stopped juggling in rooms that needed eyes. He juggled in the alley where the world could drop things without breaking lives and taught two smaller boys to keep their wrists straight, which is the beginning of knowing you can measure a thing without owning it. Orla fixed a trap that had learned to exhale the wrong way and took off a piece of old pipe that had stories written inside it and told the pipe she was sorry for making it retire. It\u2019s a stupid habit, apologizing to metal. It also keeps you from throwing it in the wrong bin.\n\nThe Listening, as some woman named it on a flyer without telling anybody, happened because they needed to retune the gates before the system forgot how to talk to itself. They met again by the traffic circle, the horse still disbelieving its own bronze, the heroic elbow aiming west at a life no one wanted anymore. A storm had arranged itself along the horizon like a row of old men complaining. The air held its watching stance. Keziah tuned the borrowed amp by clipping its hot lead to a rail that remembered being a riverboat ladder. Jun spread a new map whose back was the seconds page of a mediation from 1961; the paper smelled like decisions that had stayed decided longer than they should. The aunties tested their notes and the teenagers made them sound rude on purpose because respect is sometimes a corridor you refuse to walk in a straight line. Orla stood on the bucket arm, not shaking this time, Rowan at her shoulder in the way a jacket holds a body in weather it understands.\n\nThe first thunderclap was cheap, like a bar trick, nothing to do with their work. The second had a voice in it. She took the E and threaded it into the B-flat like a woman sewing up a pocket her hand had fallen through, and the city said yes again in the mouths of its metal. Sluice Nine hummed and its cousin Seven, which had sulked since 1912, slid one tooth into place for the first time in anyone\u2019s memory. Orla deflected a surge into the basin and another into the canal and a third toward the shipyard\u2019s empty slip where the tide could do the old job it loved. The mall wept candles into a room that needed soap and not light. The church took water at the doorway and turned it back out like a gentle bouncer telling good drinkers to go home. The school that would have had three inches on the first floor had a wet rug instead. This is what victory looks like in a city: a wet rug and a tired chorus and a policeman who lets kids sit on his hood because the ground is cleaner than the car for once.\n\nAfter, no one cheered. They breathed like a train at a station, in and out against a schedule they did not make. The clipboard man sent a text to someone that said \u201cmanageable\u201d as if it were a thing he had baked. The lanyard posted four statements with three fonts that told three different truths, none of them the one about how singing can be a wrench and a blessing and a threat and a municipal service all at once. Keziah leaned her forehead to a post long enough for splinters to consider becoming kin. Jun put the map back in its tube like a priest putting away a vestment. Orla sat down on the bucket arm without grace and held her own wrist the way Keziah had and said aloud, to nobody rude, We can teach the city a chord.\n\nThe city was listening, which is not the same thing as agreeing. It hummed in ducts and under grates and through the tired throat of the news anchor. It hummed in men who had made a profession of driving with their elbows and now found their hands on the wheel, confused, competent, surprised at themselves. It hummed in a girl writing valuations of faucets in chalk on the sidewalk, and in a boy who brought his mother a roll of tape as if he had just discovered she was excellent at all the things that had kept him alive. It hummed in Orla\u2019s ribs like a leak she could live with and fix and live with again. The gutters sang less broken because someone had turned a pin; the pipes had moods and today they were not sulking. That evening, while rain practiced piano on the yard roof and the cranes set their bones for weather, Orla went home and sat on her floor and added a second verse. It was about a door that had been painted shut for so long that people started using the window, and how, if you know what to sing, the paint remembers it was never skin.Chapter 6\n\nThe city wore fatigue like a jacket it refused to take off because the weather kept changing its mind, but there was a difference in the fit. The gutters still practiced their scales on every slight rain; the ducts still woke moody and went to sleep obstinate; the men at corners still pointed at maps on their phones as if pointing told the water where to go. But the racket had acquired something like measure. A woman sweeping a stoop paused to listen to the downspout and nodded to herself in time with the gurgle. A bus driver, normally a flinger of elbows on his own timetable, took his foot off the horn mid-curse and found his mouth humming the E that had sent the surge down the old canal cut. The air on Orla\u2019s tongue had a trace of cucumber only at the edges, as if the city had drunk a glass of water and finally noticed thirst.\n\nPaper learned to find Orla. It came to her door folded official and came in the flower pot handwritten and came under the windshield wiper of her van scrawled with marker that bled at the corners. The lanyard woman\u2019s office had turned into a hive for acronyms; the sound of printers was an insect hum that made the hair on the back of Orla\u2019s neck try to raise. There were outlines of frameworks with boxes named \u201ccommunity input\u201d the size of teaspoons and boxes named \u201crisk mitigation\u201d big as hotel beds. Jun, pocket heavy with upgraded keys and the sort of credentials you don\u2019t show, slipped one of the memos into Orla\u2019s hand and muttered that a Tone Permitting rubric was an apocalypse printed in fonts, then stole it back to scrawl in the margins where to cut it until it would bleed enough to learn manners. Keziah read none of it and all of it by watching men\u2019s shoulders around clipboards, a more reliable metric.\n\nBetween would-be governance and actual gutters, there were other rooms. The clinic\u2019s waiting room chairs had absorbed the shape of ten thousand surrenders and made each new one easier; someone had hung paper cranes made from faded evacuation flyers above the pediatric station because children like birds whether or not the birds like them back. Orla carried a wrench bag because it was the only bag she owned that felt like an honest explanation of herself. The doctor who had told the truth about Rowan\u2019s lungs examined a line of toddlers for coughs that weren\u2019t metaphors and nodded at Orla like a neighbor at the sink. \u201cYou will break the building if you sing that high,\u201d he said, wryness thin as a scalpel, and Orla sang low instead, shaping a note to soothe the vents and the women who had learned twelve ways to sit in chairs without letting themselves fall apart. It wasn\u2019t medicine and it wasn\u2019t not. A baby went from angry to asleep and a mother\u2019s mouth unhooked from the worry it had clenched.\n\nThe day the yard circled a date on a whiteboard in red\u2014the kind of red that makes men feel like they\u2019re getting away with something properly\u2014arrived with sun that felt like a dare. Static fire had always been a phrase like fireworks played through a grant application, but the men who built ardor into checklists had convinced each other and some part of the city and a slice of the sky that it would be responsible. Keziah had known her way around a thrust vector before the mayor knew the difference between a flange and a faucet; she had the gait of a person who had just set down a heavy thing you didn\u2019t even notice she was carrying. She met Orla at the gate with hands that smelled like deionized water and a forecast she didn\u2019t believe. \u201cIt will be too loud for cleverness,\u201d she said, eyes raking the catwalks. \u201cBut cleverness is what men leave out when they make a plan, so we will bring extra.\u201d\n\nSound is air leaning on a wall. Too much leaning and the wall leaves. Keziah had requisitioned the oldest shipping containers in the yard and a field of mesh that had once tried to be a sculptor\u2019s career; she pointed and men in scuffed hats pushed and a grid of metal mouths rose around the flame trench like a chorus of squat companions. Orla tapped the sides with a knuckle and heard each box answer a different vowel. There was a logic to it, a memory of Helmholtz the way a kitchen remembers a recipe after three generations of improvisation. Jun arrived late with a roll of paper taller than she was, the recording of a noise complaint from 1978 that included a diagram of the dock caverns and a paragraph that might as well have said DO NOT WHISTLE IN HERE in a tone that invited exactly that. Together they hung moisture where it mattered most\u2014blankets from the church basement, towels from a locker room, a mesh of wet laundry lines that would turn malevolent wave into weight, give the air something to kneel on.\n\nA man with a badge that said SAFETY and a nervous smile watched them as if they were either reckless or magic. \u201cWe had a consultant,\u201d he said, producing a decision tree that had been printed with blue ink, hoping blue would mean ocean and calm. \u201cWe did not budget for\u2026this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen it is free,\u201d Jun said without looking up, pinning a sheet at an angle that corrected a set of echoes the men had not thought about because echoes are not on most budgets.\n\nOrla flipped through the noises the yard knew: the gossip of cranes, the doldrum hiss of a cooling manifold, the thousand tiny annoyances of bearing steel not quite true. Somewhere below the pumps the brine moved as if remembering the basin had made a promise. She put her ear to the catwalk and it had a temperature, warmer toward the south, colder where the wind found the broken rib of a railing. She adjusted one hanging sheet by inches and felt it catch a tantrum before it began. Keziah grunted approval without wasting a sentence on it.\n\nThey didn\u2019t call it shepherding the men, but someone had to. The yard swarmed like the inside of a hive that had been built out of discipline and debt. The clipboard man had been replaced today by a cousin with a jaw like a lever, who announced \u201cT minus\u201d in a voice that made Orla think of the word minus as a person who politely stole a fork from someone else\u2019s place setting and put it back on his own. Truck horns at the far fence blared in their own attempt to participate; a knot of men had gathered with the sort of signs men make when they love to be punished by their own cleverness. They were not one thing either. Some wanted selfies with noise; some wanted to drown it to prove they could; some had been told to show up and had dutifully borrowed outrage. The horns were a single coarse note at first until the men, being men, competed. Orla listened, found the two that were a half-step apart and crooked as grocery carts, and began to hum between them. One brain at a time the horns fell into a chord, uneasy and not pretty, but not the kind of chaos that makes structures rip.\n\n\u201cIf you turn that into brass,\u201d Keziah said, making a face and then softening it, \u201cI\u2019ll forgive you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI turned them into helpers so they\u2019ll be too proud to stop,\u201d Orla said, and the horns kept on, men finding in their arms something to do that did not require hitting anyone.\n\nThe first cough of flame down the throat of the trench was the kind of sound that tells skin it is a bystander; the second slammed the yard into attention without a speech. Static fire shows you whether a machine knows its own name. Orla should not have been able to hear anything like herself against that shove. She felt, instead, the notes inside the notes, the way a closed mouth still has words in it. Somewhere in the long body of the rocket a turbopump had a stubbornness she recognized. It whined almost, nearly, at a frequency that makes men think God is calling but is only the sound of a blade saying I hate you, I love you, I hate you, I\u2014 She dropped a fourth beneath the E like a gravel bag, and the box to the west of the trench sang back like a barrel in a barn. That detuned the whine to sulk, which was safer than romance.\n\nJun\u2019s pencil ticked across the map even though the map had nothing to do with rockets. She had found that tracing lines in a room where lines were drawn by fire soothed the part of her that needed to explain. \u201cNorth fence is sympathetic to F above middle C,\u201d she said to nobody to prove she still had teeth, and a moment later the north fence rang, confirming she had not made herself up.\n\nThe yard had a roar at the back of it, a sub-bass that made your stomach ask if you had eaten wrong. Orla sent the choir of shipping containers a long slow vowel, adjusted with the heel of her hand on the mic stand like persuading an awkward friend to dance. You could feel noise take a step back, give itself permission to be directional instead of everywhere at once. Keziah checked three vibrating bolts by resting her palm on their brackets in sequence because you can count tight by counting buzz. The static fire hit its scheduled plateau and two of the men who loved a schedule wiped their eyes because tears leaked out of you on their own clock.\n\nMidway, a shudder rolled up the stack that was not in any manual; the scaffolding caught it and sent it back down like an insult. Orla tasted metal that had been told to be patient for eight months and had reached its limit. She changed her mouth shape and the vowel changed place; her jaw went into a corner of the word she would not be able to describe later. The shudder agreed not to become a fight and became an argument. The argument is what structures survive. Jun nodded, breath audible through her teeth, filing for later the moment a line on paper had prevented a line of stress from misbehaving.\n\nIt ended because somebody had written a time on a board and wealth had arranged itself around that time and loved being obeyed. The roar shut its eyes like a man falling asleep at his desk. Air rushed in to fill the space where force had been and tripped over itself. Silence arrived heavy, the kind you set down carefully so it doesn\u2019t bang. The wet hanging laundry lines dripped quietly, happy to have had a job any idiot could understand. The horns at the fence attempted one victory blare and then, finding no enemy, fell into laughter that did a better job of keeping the structure friendly.\n\n\u201cNothing broke that we didn\u2019t already mean to fix,\u201d Keziah said, voice blown ragged at the edges in the way of a woman who has been roaring inside her head for an hour and would prefer to be quiet in her bones now. She did not look at Orla with any expression a man would have recognized as gratitude because that made it easier to stand upright.\n\nThe news did what news does. It attached cameras to smiles and arranged sentences into ladders the wrong people climbed. A man who had never been inside an engine pronounced the whole thing a miracle of public-private partnership, as if the city were two parenthesis and he were the dash they held up. A woman with hair that did not change in weather tried to ask Orla what the ethical framework was for interfering with a planned acoustic environment, and Orla answered by naming three wrenches and one choir, and the editor found a way to make that not air. A boy sent the audio of the shipping containers to his grandmother, who said without charity that men had built bigger boxes for smaller reasons.\n\nAfter the static there was an elastic, slack time where people tried to see if the world would retract to its previous size. It didn\u2019t. In the drag of that, the file from the Library lit up like an unguarded stove. The city had discovered the rumor of what Orla had done in the Chamber and, as cities do, had shaved it into news and dressed it in costumes. Headlines married appetite to inheritance and then put them on trial. Some people wanted to call her a saint of pipes and some wanted to call her a cannibal of legacy and some wanted to call her on the phone and ironically they had better words than that. It is hard to let private things be private when they are public infrastructure. Orla refused interviews that wanted the recipe and accepted conversations from women who needed to know how to make a door that would open for all the girls behind them and not slam shut on their own hand.\n\nJun did what Jun does: she wrote down the problem until it had to be honest and then she found legal paper that didn\u2019t ask permission to exist. She drafted a license on Library time that began, Songs as Infrastructure: A Civic Commons, and under it put sentences so plain the men kept looking for the trick. The license said you could not own a voice that turned the water from harm to not, even if you attached it to a platform and a lanyard and five subcommittees. It said downloads were for survival and also joy. It said if you built a gate you had to count how many people liked it, not how many people you kept out. It said nothing about ghosts, because Jun knew that if you write a door in law for a ghost the wrong men walk through it and sell the hinges. The clerk with the grandmother in the noodle church stamped it and went home on a bus that hummed under him and told his cousin everything.\n\nOrla did not write a song about the Chamber and her mouth and the smallest part because there are things you do not turn into rhyme and sell back to yourself. She wrote a verse about inheritance that called it soup and not blood and put into it a line Rowan would have hated and loved: we cooked our dead into instructions the way you cook a bone until it lets go. She put that line in her pocket and did not sing it yet. She did not need to; the pipes hummed that sentiment in a crude way when they remembered who they were carrying for, and the aunties corrected them at the end of each phrase.\n\nWhile the city argued itself into enlightenment and then out again on the hour, water continued to behave as always. A facility upriver spat a breath of something not labeled properly and the water licked its teeth. Keziah found a little pitting on a vane and kissed her teeth and Orla made the choir hold a discord long enough to convince a pump that cavitation was a life choice it could skip. The Listening that had felt like an experiment turned regular the way a dinner that happens twice in a row turns into a tradition if you have the nerve to call it one. Sluice Seven got jealous in a way only a gate can and they cajoled it with a note it remembered from 1912 when a woman whose name never made it into any book had tapped it with a ladle during a breach and told it to behave because she had six kids and five pots and no room for this.\n\nThe registry kept trying to mitt Orla into safe lanes. It suggested collaboration with a brand. It offered to put her face on a poster with a child wearing noise-cancelers and a tagline about decibels and duty. It pitched a line of licensed wrenches that would spark joy without sparking anything dangerous. When she did not answer, the registry sent the lanyard with a smile that was a better fence than any; it asked again to be allowed to put her in front of a board that had discovered it could be generous at scale with other people\u2019s gusts. Orla said she would stand in front of any board that would sit in front of Sluice Nine for three hours and write down what it learned about patience. There were no takers and there were three shocked sighs, which felt like a good day\u2019s tally.\n\nMercy in a city arrives in sneaky places. A laundromat on Ninth whose owner had been fined twice for refusing to install a television and once for cooking beans in the back let the Listening dry their damp hanging baffles for free and made every child leave with two mismatched socks on purpose like a game to remind them they had been somewhere they were part of the machinery. The Pickling Works, having considered its sharpness and found it wanting, went back to its old recipes for a week and the men pretended not to notice and then sighed like a crowd remembering their first honest meal in a season. The church basement\u2019s noodles tasted more like soup and less like damp cardboard, and the pastor had the nerve to ask Orla to fix a toilet afterward because the Lord does not despise small labor and because salvation is passive voice for help me carry this bucket.\n\nThe men who had organized their horns into a chord showed up at the yard with a sheepish box of donuts and wanted very much to talk about engines. One of them, whose watch remembered better times, said without a joke that he was tired of being a person who only learned to push and wanted to learn to pull. Keziah handed him a length of line and pointed at a chain that had been sulking under its own rust; he pulled until it moved and made a face like a man experiencing opinion where muscle had been, and laughed in a way that suggested he might bring lunch next time on purpose.\n\nOn the second Tuesday after the static fire, a rumor exactly the size of a window slithered into the yard with the same energy. The men with dry shoes had found money to write a date for a launch the way you write a name in icing on a cake, not because the cake needs sweet to be cake but because it looks good in photographs. The basin was behaving like a friend who had finally learned to say no to late-night calls and might not always pick up. The brine had subsided to a level that made the clipboard men stand taller and the aunties cock their heads. A day with less water is a day when men forget to be grateful and start deciding again without asking, and you could feel that arrogance slide back into the room like a shadow under a door.\n\nOrla could have said no to being at the yard that day, but saying no to noises she wanted to shape felt like letting someone else tune a pipe with a hammer. She said yes to Keziah with her eyes. Jun pretended to be needed by three committees at once and in the gaps brought them a bag of bolts and a list of ward captains who had called to say that if anyone suggested a celebratory horn parade they would throw shoes.\n\nThe morning of the window smelled like cardboard and concentrate. Men ran their hands down their shirts twice before a camera saw them; women tucked two extra bandanas into back pockets like talismans. Over the basin the air looked normal, which is to say treacherous and probable. The crowd by the fence did not gather like a mob but like neighbors whose leases had been rewritten without them and were curious who had signed their names. The lanyard woman stood under a new hard hat that had a sticker on it with a logo adjusted to match the color of the sky. The badge with the fencepost spine had once again become the person whose yes would be carved in blame if things became no.\n\nKeziah\u2019s hands were steady and therefore her voice could afford trembling. \u201cEveryone who matters is here,\u201d she said toward the rail and maybe toward Orla, then to the pumps in a tone she used for bolts that would strip if you used the wrong wrench. \u201cDo your jobs. Do not show off. I am very tired.\u201d\n\nThe first flame was theatre, the second a statement. The machine bit down into the bolts it had chosen; the air lifted its elbows; the water in the basin clenched and then kept being water. For a minute, the roar settled into a steady insistence and each person in the yard remembered a different person they loved, which is what big noise does; it wipes the slate and puts a picture back in a corner out of nowhere. Orla sang and was mostly singing to the inside of her own head, but things inside her head had learned how to go places.\n\nThe tremor came different than static. It wasn\u2019t upward; it wasn\u2019t down. It was a side to side like a child\u2019s first wrong step, a hint of pogo nobody had scheduled because the math for that had been done, signed, filed. Men who trusted math looked around as if to find the person they could accuse of rounding. Keziah\u2019s jaw made a list. Jun\u2019s pencil snapped and she took it as a sign to use her voice and called, A-sharp, blunt, and Orla grinned because the aunties had named that note stubborn and the names were the same thing today. She sent the A-sharp and felt it take a bite out of the tremor like a good dog at a bad ankle. The containers were not enough; she saw the odd bounce on a midspan brace and hated the engineer who had chosen cost over calm and sent him forgiveness in a chord, because you have to forgive the dead who built the living you hate, or live bitter in a room full of pipes you will never listen to right.\n\nSomeone at the fence shouted come down because they thought she would be safer closer to the ground, and Orla thought for a cold second of falling, and then thought, Safety is such a liar when it is trying to hide control, and stayed where her mouth could aim. The tremor tried to climb anyway the way ivy does when you swear you cut it to nothing. She found the space in the back of her throat where Rowan had kept the sound he used to scold a leaking trap without waking the house, and she put the house to sleep with it. There is a note you can sing that is not music and is still mercy; it tells metal you remember what it wants to be on a day when everyone asks it to be other. The pogo wavered. The basin did its ancient job again with the patience of geology. The machine remembered to be muscle and not mouth.\n\nIf the city cheered, it did it in private between girders. In public, it took off its hat and put it on and took it off again and pretended it was not crying at its own wrist. The men whose horns had joined the chord last time made no sound. The lanyard woman put a line through a word on a page no one would see and wrote the same word again in a letter two days later and called it leadership. A child by the fence, scolded for not covering ears, covered eyes instead and bragged later to a cousin that it had been louder that way, which was true enough to keep.\n\nAfter, under the shadow of a crane that thought it was a bird when it was very tired, Orla leaned against hot steel and said to nobody she could name, \u201cI cannot be the hinge forever,\u201d and Keziah, who had not been listening because she had been relighting the furnace of her own heart, said, \u201cGood, because I like doors but I love walls that hold.\u201d Jun arrived with a thermos of coffee that tasted like ocean and blame and set it between them. They drank without letting their mouths touch the lid because certain intimacies are for other days and because the yard had eyes. A man walked by and didn\u2019t say thank you and for once it did not take anything from the room to let him keep his silence.\n\nIn the week that followed, the city found its appetite for ordinary again. It argued about parking and our lady of the basilica\u2019s new paint and whether the market should allow a pop-up selling kombucha pronounced wrong. It put bubble wrap around the places where the brine had made edges and let kids pop the bubbles without telling them what they represented. It made the aunties saints in two neighborhoods where men did not usually admit sainthood came with a haircut and a grocery list. The Registry issued a press release that sounded like a marriage proposal written by a committee and addressed to a person who had already eloped. Orla fixed a skittish check valve in an old walk-up and a boy showed her a frog he had rescued from a puddle that was too sharp and she bit her mouth because it was a decent thing to do and because there is never enough decency but sometimes there is exactly one frog at the right time.\n\nThe other rumor on the wind wore different shoes. You could hear it in the courthouse corridor where men with memory loss in their eyes looked at women carrying copies of records like knives. You could hear it in the supply room at the yard where someone wrote on a white board in dry erase paint that was never meant to erase DECIBEL CREDIT BANK and then changed the subject when Keziah walked in. You could hear it in the Library stacks where Jun found a budget draft that suggested the Listening be brought indoors under the auspices of Men With Permission and moved to Thursdays. There is always a rumor that wants to turn songs into permits. Jun rolled the draft into a tube and slid it under the leg of a table that wobbled and called that governance, and laughed alone, the brittle laughter of someone who has managed to be promoted into a position where she can be fired publicly for being right.\n\nAt night in Orla\u2019s apartment the pipes had begun to speak with an authority that was not Rowan\u2019s. His voice was in there, kind as an old screw head that had seen the right screwdriver; his laugh made the elbow in the bathroom never complain even when the building shivered. But something else had moved into the throat of the walls, something older than the registry and younger than the bricks. It came like a bassline through the hot water riser, steady, curious, not asking permission to exist. It asked her for nothing but attention and delivered nothing but request. She found that if she put her bare feet on the tile and her head against the plaster where the pipe elbowed through, she could hear it almost speak. The city, if you want to name it, had decided to use her for a mouth for one thing only: its need to be called by a name she had not thought to ask it for.\n\nShe outlasted the urge to hold a ceremony for that. There are so many ceremonies waiting for women who have done anything even slightly strange; you can lose your entire life to them and die without ever doing the work again. She sat with her back against the wall and thought about the first time she had held a chase nipple in her small hand and felt the joy of a piece of metal that knew its job. She thought about the day the men invented a word that did not exist\u2014picklecatastrophe\u2014and how quickly it had become a tool they shook at each other when they forgot what problem they had actually made. She thought about Keziah\u2019s hand finding her waist without asking for permission in a moment when permission was noise, not safety, and finding that she had saved herself an answer by not falling. She thought about Jun\u2019s laugh in bureaucrat rooms and how it had become a fulcrum.\n\nWhen sleep came, it brought Rowan and something else, a river mouth with a voice like sand and a laugh like a bell in a fog. The dream had the taste of metal, which meant her body had decided to be honest. The river mouth said, without moving, You are not the hinge, girl, you are a bolt. Bolts are not heroes, and bolts are not poets, but the world falls apart at the failure of the humble, and heroes and poets alike go through. She woke up angry for half a second at the demotion and then hungry in the way a person is when called to labor instead of applause. On the radio, the anchor had learned to distinguish between weather and consequences and had begun, cautiously, to tell the difference in his sentences.\n\nAt the Listening that Thursday, which no committee could reschedule no matter how they moved the boxes on their forms, the aunties sang the A-sharp with the swagger of women who had saved a school from a wet rug and knew it. The teenagers added a blue note they had no right to and everyone forgave them because the world would always need something rude to pull it forward. Orla taught a new line about a door that had been painted shut and how paint remembers being sky if you unteach it. The pipes obeyed, which is to say they argued in an orderly fashion and then did. In the back, a girl with a wrench on her shoulder drawn in crayon on her shirt elbowed a boy who had learned to juggle without dropping anything and said, It sounds like our house, and he said, It is our house, in a tone that sounded like a promise pretending to be a simple fact so it could live.\n\nThe launch window narrowed then widened then narrowed because men negotiate with sky like they negotiate with each other, repeating their names until one of them sticks to a wall. The basin held with dignity and demanded its due. The registry discovered, to its dismay and secret delight, that a commons license is cheaper than a war. The lanyard woman adjusted to the idea of being the person who got the right things wrong in public and wore her new mistakes with a competence that finally let her take off her smile. The clipboard men evolved into safety men into operations men into men who did not need to be told twice which direction the brine will prefer; evolution is expensive when you have shoes you love.\n\nOn the morning the window narrowed enough to truth and everybody knew it without being told, Jun appeared in Orla\u2019s doorway with a bag of bolts, a map, an apple, and a look that said something had been waiting in a stack too long and had finally stretched its legs. \u201cThey will do it today,\u201d she said, and her face did not decide whether to be hope or the other thing. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a speech. This isn\u2019t a fight. This is a ride. He would have hated it,\u201d and Rowan\u2019s name did not have to be spoken because the pipe down the hall made a sympathetic sound like a saint being reminded of a sin they had chosen on purpose.\n\n\u201cThen we will sing,\u201d Orla said, and Keziah\u2019s knock on the door meant they didn\u2019t have time to sit with the brutal plainness of that and they would carry it with them anyway like a wrench you don\u2019t use but need because your hand is used to its weight. The yard had eyes like a person waiting for a diagnosis. The basin had been combed in a deliberate way that made men feel they had asked gravity to sign permission slips. The horns at the fence were quiet, their men having learned from the last time that sometimes participating is pointing and sometimes it is not doing that.\n\nIf the city had a name other than the one on maps it did not say it. If the city had a song other than the ones we give it daily by living in it, it did not sing it. It hummed though, a hum in ducts and ribs and old wood and the seam where carpet meets tile. Orla stood where her mouth did a job bolts cannot and let herself carry all the ordinary heavy little things she would carry in any case because glamour is a liar and work is also a liar and together they make something close enough to honest to hold while the sky tests the math and the man at the microphone remembers to say the number only once.\n\nThe flame came and the noise made an altar of the ground and the brine told a joke in a low voice and kept going west and east with equanimity. The rocket did what rockets do when they have been listened to enough: it stayed, then moved, then stayed, then did not fail. Orla sang, which meant sometimes she spoke under the roar and sometimes she did not and sometimes she made a face and the city read it and translated. Keziah watched bolts that were her friends and welded her hands to the air with worry. Jun wrote one line on the back of a receipt that would be studied later by women who were tired of reading only men with badges, and the line was not poetry and not law but was the thing both pretend to be: Open on the note you can live with after.\n\nThey opened on that note. The rest of it\u2014what happens when a city decides to pronounce its own name in front of the sky, what happens when men hear it and want credit, what happens when a woman\u2019s mouth becomes a tool and no one can take it out of her hand\u2014was the story that would have to be told another day, in another room, with all the chairs moved against the wall to make space for dancing that did not ask permission because it had done the work and brought the towels.Chapter 9\n\nThe city wore a different sort of noise now, one with a pulse it had learned rather than a pulse it had been born with. The gutters had picked up a trick from the aunties and released their syllables cleanly at the end of phrases. Ducts were still moody, but more like teenagers who hear themselves and blush when they catch their own reflection arguing with the world. Men on stoops debated the exact minute the basin had saved the launch as if they\u2019d been standing with their hands in the valves, and the arguments had softened in places the way rope softens when it has done enough pulling to learn it is, in fact, not alone. Orla moved through it with the attention of someone who had spent too much time under sinks and now knew rooms by their breath, and her own throat had the feeling you get after shouting at the ocean: not hurt, exactly, but lined with a memory of power that makes quiet feel like a decision rather than a lack.\n\nMen inside the municipal building had summoned a meeting to discuss the Decibel Credit Bank, and the phrase came back to the street with the smell of printer toner and the livid sheen of an obvious mistake. You could tell who had liked the phrase by who repeated it with all its capital letters and who wrote it small so it could be erased by laughter. Jun brought home a copy with a coffee stain she hadn\u2019t made and drew lines through boxes until the paper looked like a map of a city that refused to turn its streets into toll roads. Keziah flicked a crumb off a box of bolts in the yard and said aloud to the air, \u201cNo bank can hold that note,\u201d and she meant both the money and the sound. The Listening kept on as if no one had tried to coin it into tokens, and in rooms that smelled like noodles and bleach the notes fell where they needed to and lifted where they were asked, the way a decent neighbor does with a couch on moving day.\n\nPhone calls began to arrive from places where the river did not have an address but did have memory. A woman with a voice like gravel and a laugh like a slipway called from two towns upriver and said their intake screens had begun to cough and they could tell the brine was creeping up to see how the other half lived. She had no patience for the men at her council who liked minutes more than water; she had been told Jun\u2019s name by a baker and Keziah\u2019s by a man who sold rebar and Orla\u2019s by a child who had seen chalk on a wall and decided it was a sort of weather report. The upstream weir, she said, had stopped behaving like a wall and started behaving like a sulk. Its operator had a badge and a shrug. The farmers had already moved their tractors to the highest ground that could still be called ground. She asked, without ceremony and without apology, if the women who had made the city hum might teach the river to remember upstream.\n\nThey took the van with the defaced mermaid because heroes and saints don\u2019t have better transportation and because the van knew the route to water like a dog finds its way to a lake from a car window. Keziah tuned the engine by ear as they climbed out of the city\u2019s orchestral bowl and into a ribbon of road that remembered being a path with a horse on it. Jun secured three rolled maps with a belt and told them, in the tone of a librarian telling a ghost where to sit, that the River Compact men would be there with new hats and old authority. Orla put her hand on the dash the way she put her hand on a pipe and listened to the van\u2019s complaint and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll stop for coffee where the sign says pie and the pie has a first name,\u201d because travel requires treaties even with your own expectations.\n\nUpriver, the air was less city and more tin roof. The sound underfoot was different too, a long vowel of earth that had not been compressed under brick and had none of the city\u2019s proud consonants. The town had a bakery that smelled like the sort of bread you remember when you cannot remember anything else, and in front of it men leaned the way men leaned in any town that had not yet decided whether its river was friend or boss. The weir sat like a molar the town had never forgiven itself for needing. Its concrete was from a decade when concrete believed in itself more than the people who ordered it did. The operator in his box had the posture of a man whose job never made the news and whose marriage depended on not forgetting which box on the form meant to call before taking action.\n\n\u201cGarrison Weir,\u201d Jun read off the old brass plate with the indulgence of someone correcting a book that had printed the wrong name. She had already learned the gossip of the hinges from the map: built after a flood, argued over by cousins who stopped being cousins, reauthorized like a lie that had become a habit. Keziah put her hand to one of the exposed bolts and hissed between her teeth at the way its threads complained. Orla put her ear to the sheath of pipe that ran from the gatehouse to the river like a nerve and heard a hum that was not only water. There was a tone to the metal itself that said it had been made by a factory with men who were bored in the winter and got into trouble in the spring, and it made a different sort of complaint than the city\u2019s old iron did, less poetic and more literal minded, as if it were a man who wanted instructions and not a story.\n\nThe River Compact men had faces borrowed from other rooms where men wore hats and told time out loud. They had a young woman with them who had a binder and a haircut that left her neck exposed like a dare, and she smiled at the women the way a person smiles across a drawbridge that is going to hold neither of them for the whole conversation. \u201cWe\u2019d like to avoid any unauthorized acoustic intervention,\u201d one of the men read, as if he had just learned all three words and wanted to exercise them. The binder woman said, almost under her breath, \u201cWe\u2019d like to avoid salting a county,\u201d and Orla liked her at once for knowing how to put two things in a sentence and let them lean on each other without either falling.\n\nFarmers arrived in their own language: boots with rivers written up the sides, faces like weather maps, hands that knew more about patience than any door could teach you. An auntie in a clean skirt stepped out from behind a pile of pallets and stood as if she had been waiting her whole life to speak to a woman who would listen. She sang four syllables in a tune that woke up meadowlarks and the weir operator put his cigarette out not because of the rule but because his grandfather had taught him to listen when that song took the air. Orla answered without taking the lead. She shook the binder woman\u2019s hand and asked for the service manual to the gate. The operator looked offended and then relieved that someone wanted it. Keziah took it and flipped to the parts diagrams like a priest finding a psalm that hurts less to sing.\n\nUnlike Sluice Nine, Garrison had pride. It thought its job was to say no until a clock said yes. It had a gear that wanted oil it had not smelled in a year, and a latch that would not latch for anyone who pronounced its name wrong. Orla could feel the brine behind it like a rumor in a classroom, leaning in, waiting to see if the substitute teacher would enforce the rules. The choice was the same as at the traffic circle and also not the same. Upstream, there were fields that used the river\u2019s kindness as calendar and charm. Opening here to push the brine back toward the basin would save intakes and hurt acres where corn made decisions about a family\u2019s winter. Closing here to save rows would let the city drink trouble a week later with sugar in it to hide the taste. There was no version where nobody got wet.\n\n\u201cI am not your hinge,\u201d Orla said, not to the men and not to the aunties, but to the weir with its teeth. \u201cI will show you the note, and the note will show you the rest.\u201d She backed away from the place on the rail where a person stands when she wants to be seen. She put the binder on the hood of a truck and held it open with a wrench. Jun took three pins from her hair and drew a diagram in the dust that matched the one on paper but included a circle labeled \u201cWomen,\u201d and it was not an appeal, it was a fact. Keziah looped a rope over a bollard like a sentence you could finish two ways and handed the other end to a farmer with a shoulder you could put an order on.\n\nThey did not have the aunties from the church basement but they had this county\u2019s aunties, and their notes tasted like pie filling and anger and girls\u2019 names whose donors had expected sons. Teenagers who had been pretending they did not like anything found they liked this, the way your face looks when your mouth holds a sound that will change a piece of metal. The men with the hats put hands to their belts and decided to be useful because a room full of women with purpose makes a hat heavy. The operator opened his window and said, after a silence that felt like a big dog sniffing your hand, \u201cShe likes B. Don\u2019t ask me why. We\u2019ve tried.\u201d Jun nodded as if she had finally been given the last ingredient to a stew she already knew how to make.\n\nIt was not complicated and it was not simple. The aunties took a B and made it true. The teenagers pressed it with harmony until the weir\u2019s pride turned it into obedience without quite feeling insulted. Orla put an E underneath when the rigging needed something to lean on and did not let herself be a leader so much as a level, correcting a tilt with her hands before anyone saw it. Keziah watched the rope with a gaze that softened into relief at the ways a knot can take opinion and hold it still without cruelty. The brine crept and then backed, not because it had been told to by law but because water listens when you make it an honest request. A field down the road took a drink it hadn\u2019t asked for and survived it because three farmers had foreseen the resentment of the day and carved a furrow with their stubbornness.\n\nOn the other side of the county, another weir without a plaque moved because someone Orla would never meet had taught another set of aunties to hear its latch. Downstream, the basin loosened into its less dramatic work, chewing other people\u2019s sins with the steady jaws of a kind animal. The Decibel Credit Bank needed a single song to meter and found instead a county full of women adjudicating against drought, and its software\u2019s patience went out for cigarettes and did not return. Jun\u2019s eyebrows rose half an inch when the error page loaded and she took a picture to show to the lanyard woman later, not to gloat but to document the moment a gate forgot its job and a commons remembered it.\n\nAfter, the River Compact men wanted a photograph. They wanted to hold the rope in the photo, not because they had pulled it but because they had learned enough to know standing near work made a body less foolish. The binder woman did not smile in the picture and that made it better. The operator of the weir leaned out of his window and tapped the side of his box and said, \u201cShe likes B,\u201d and the teenagers cheered him as if he\u2019d delivered a baby. The aunties arranged to meet next Thursday because people like to name a thing a tradition as soon as it\u2019s happened twice. Orla did not look for a camera. She took the wrench off the manual and closed it and looked at the farmer whose crops had gotten a little too mouthy and said, \u201cTell me what the drain does behind your barn,\u201d because ask a better question and you\u2019ll get a better plan.\n\nOn the way back, the van felt lighter. Not in the way of magic, but in the way of a basket that holds three apples instead of two because someone finally stopped pretending the third apple was too heavy. They did not stop for pie because they had eaten other kinds of sweetness and that was enough, and also because the bakery was closed with a sign that said GONE TO THE WEIR in handwriting that assured the reader the pie would be better tomorrow because the cook had a story to tell it. Jun looked at Orla over the map tube and said, \u201cThey will come to take what we made and put it in a binder,\u201d and Orla said, \u201cThen we will teach the binders to sing,\u201d and Keziah laughed so hard she had to pull the van over and put her head on the wheel, which startled a flock of birds in a field and made them turn into punctuation in the sky.\n\nThe city was not offended to see them again. Cities don\u2019t get offended so much as they change the subject when you think you\u2019re the one making it. The basin had the contentment of a neighbor whose living room had hosted a meeting where the right people finally asked the right questions. The horns at the fence had fallen into a habit of not needing to prove themselves on days without a plan. The lanyard sent a message that contained the phrase \u201cpilot project\u201d three times and \u201ccommunity protocol\u201d once, which is how you know someone learned something they will make into an acronym later. Jun went to a meeting knowing she would need to be gentle until the last five minutes and then unkind in a way that saves more time than it costs. Keziah went to tighten a bolt that had been tight yesterday and learned that relief loosens metal just as fear does, which is why nothing stays done without being loved again.\n\nAt home, the pipes had a dampness in their tone that meant the weather had a new hobby. A child on the third floor had discovered she could make the stairwell sing if she ran her hand on the rail in time to the rhythm of her feet, and that song ran down into Orla\u2019s ear with the confidence of a city that has started writing its own instructions on the walls it owns. In the van\u2019s side panel, the mermaid\u2019s devil tail caught the late sun and turned it into a wink. Someone had written under the chalk We Are Not Pickles a smaller chalk line that said We Are Bolts, with a heart on one side and a wrench on the other, and a girl stood nearby eating an ice pop as if she had always expected to see such a sentence and was happy to know she\u2019d been right.\n\nThe rockets held their station on the horizon like stubborn punctuation. When they finally left properly, it was early morning and nobody had been promised joy so it came clean. Men cried in private and later claimed the wind had got them. Women wiped hands on aprons and called neighbors to the stoop and let it be what it was without asking it to be more. The yard was still and then not. The long mouth of the machine opened and spoke fire, and the basin did its job without applause. Orla did not sing at it as if it were a dog; she sang at her own body so it would hold still where it needed to and flex where it must. Keziah said nothing to the bolts and thought everything a person can think at metal without disturbing its work. Jun watched the faces of the men who had become better men and the faces of the men who had found this made no difference to them and made a note that would hurt later and be needed sooner.\n\nLaunch did not end anything. It made a new kind of noise in town for a while and then faded into the kind of pride that turns into chores. After, more paper came. After, the Registry tried to sell commemorative wrenches and discovered the commons license had teeth in it and those teeth were currently busy eating graft. After, a boy moved his grandmother\u2019s piano three inches away from the wall and found the note the apartment needed to stop damp crawling up the plaster. After, a woman at the Pickling Works started to whistle while she worked for the first time in a year and the foreman did not tell her to stop because every time he opened his mouth to be wrong he remembered a sink and shut it.\n\nThere were things the story did not do for them. Rowan did not come back and say you did good; he floated where the pipes forget and the river remembers and visited Orla only in work and in the shiver before a gate opens. The Decibel Bank did not dissolve; it became a committee with a different name and better biscuits. The Compact men did not stay humble; they found new hats. But the bridge between upstream and down had become a regular path, not a pilgrimage, and women could now walk across it without asking for a pass.\n\nThat evening, when the long day had taken off its shoes, Orla stood with Keziah at the edge of the salt flats where the cranes turned black against a lemon sky. The city\u2019s breath had slowed. The ocean lay where it always lay, which is to say as close as it could get without starting a fight. They did not touch. They had learned that not touching was a kind of touch when the world was loud and you wanted to keep one thing that was yours silent and true. Keziah scuffed a heel in the crust and said, \u201cThey asked me again to go,\u201d meaning the dry city with its salaries and its labs with carpet that never knew salt. Orla watched a gull invent a new insulting angle and said, \u201cThey always will. You are the thing they cannot make a machine for.\u201d The space between them carried more words than their mouths would risk.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Keziah said, and let the words be simple, which made them costly and worth paying for. \u201cNot while this place remembers my name. Later, maybe, when it is rude to stay.\u201d She looked at the horizon as if hoping to catch a misstep and punish it kindly. \u201cYou?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a bolt,\u201d Orla said, and could feel the river\u2019s laugh in her teeth and Rowan\u2019s old hand in the way her shoulder let itself settle. \u201cI don\u2019t leave. I hold. Or I teach other bolts, and then I hold less, and that will be the best day I have.\u201d\n\nJun arrived in the half-light with a stack of forms held together by an elastic that would break when it would cause the most hilarity and the least harm. She had a ribbon threaded through the top sheet like a joke and it read LICENSE: Commons, Tone As Infrastructure. The city had signed itself, awkward and grand, as if writing its own name for the first time. \u201cThey\u2019re going to pretend they invented it,\u201d she said, pleased and tired and mean in the way that saves people, \u201cso we let them, and we keep the real thing here where the pipes can read it when they forget.\u201d She put the forms on the hood of the van and the mermaid accepted them as if she knew legal paper when she saw it and liked it better with grease spots.\n\nThey ate stale cookies left over from a safety training and called it dessert because sometimes a treat is nothing more than a mundane thing eaten with people who know what you mean when you call yourself a bolt. Behind them the city cleared its throat and went on. In a tenement two neighborhoods over, a couple argued about a frying pan and then sang under their breath at the same moment and decided they were ridiculous and not dangerous and laughed themselves into bed. In the Library, a flood plan from 1938 spoke in pencil to a flood plan from last week and agreed to be wrong together in a way that might make them right enough. At the basin, the water slapped its own edges and pretended it was not proud of what it had held.\n\nOrla went home and lay on her floor and let the tile do that thing tile does when the day has cooked you. She sang one line softly that had been waiting under her tongue since Garrison had shown its teeth. It was about how the door stops being painted shut if you bother to unstick the hinge and then don\u2019t make a ceremony of walking through it. It was about how women are never the hinge only to other people and always the bolt to themselves if they\u2019re wise, and how wisdom is a habit of hand. She did not write it down. She put it on the top shelf of her memory where the dust doesn\u2019t settle because the house keeps moving and the air keeps its promise to carry.\n\nIn the morning the gutters asked for scales and got them. In the afternoon a boy showed Orla a frog he had learned to carry without squeezing and a woman showed Orla the way her sink no longer sulked when the weather changed. At dusk, the first new word for what they had done arrived in town and stuck on three mouths. It was not a better word than Listening, but it did a job: Tuning. It was the sort of word men could say without feeling like they were borrowing a dress and the sort of word women could say without wanting to hide. It would do until someone coined a better song, and in the meantime the pipes, with moods and elbows and courtesy when asked, kept their end of the bargain and made the city sound small enough to hear when it needed to and big enough to carry them when it had to.Chapter 10\n\nSummer moved in without making an appointment, and the city agreed to be hot the way it agrees to be anything that shows up with its own chair. The gutters, cocky after their education, tried out ornaments at the end of phrases that made the old women laugh and the young men roll their eyes like dice. Ductwork exhaled with the weary grandeur of sopranos in cheap operas. Children drew notes on the sidewalk in chalk, letters inside circles with arrows pointing to downspouts like treasure maps made for people who already knew where the treasure lived. The Registry attempted a rebrand on a Tuesday afternoon and papered a few bus shelters with an advertisement that read Tuning: Powered by Community, Sponsored by Us. The poster had a microphone wearing a halo and a wrench wearing sunglasses. Somebody\u2019s aunt peeled one down and used it to line a cabinet drawer as if citizenship could be made useful by getting close to the flour.\n\nThe three of them\u2014the woman with the maps, the woman with the cranes, the woman with the mouth\u2014stood in the Library\u2019s back room and stared at a stack of requests until the paper looked like a topographical feature you might have to give a name to. The stacks were tied with string and punctuated by fruit stickers, the unofficial stamp of neighborhood legit. Help us with the vents in the rec center, wrote a man who had accidentally raised three daughters into women and was still surprised by the competence that haunted his kitchen table. The clinic sent a note on a sheet that had once been a list of syringes: the exam room sings like a swamp; teach us to make it less cruel. The aunties proposed Thursday nights on purpose. The teenagers asked if they could come and if they had to be quiet and the answer to both was no if you were clever and yes if you were not.\n\nJun, promoted into a position that came with an impressive lanyard and the ability to stall whole departments with a phone call, set up a calendar whose days looked like teeth. She drew a grid called Tuning Bench: Parishes and Pumps, because the city still thought of itself in parishes even when it pretended to be districts and zones. Keziah scavenged a rolling cart and turned it into a kit\u2014coils of cable like patient snakes, a battered amp, a fist of microphones, a multimeter she had named Patience in a black marker hand that refused to be decorative. Orla sorted the calls into songs\u2014rooms that needed the A-sharp because stubbornness was baked into their drywall, alleys that wanted E because old bricks carried grief like a flavor, stairwells that needed the note a person makes when she sees herself in a mirror and decides she will keep the day anyway.\n\nThe Lanyard called with a request that sounded like a trap and turned out to be an invitation to guard the trap\u2019s hinges. \u201cCivic Phonetics Council,\u201d she said, apologetic for the title and not for the room. \u201cIf you don\u2019t sit at it, someone will, and they\u2019ll end up naming a form after you that does a thing you hate. Come make shapes on paper that your aunties can walk through.\u201d Jun agreed before Orla could groan, on the theory that no room should be left without the possibility of mercy, and also because she wanted to see if a committee could be tuned. Keziah went too and wore a shirt with an oil stain she refused to apologize for, and three men in suits who had come prepared to be charmed into obedience found themselves behaving genuinely because the room\u2019s air had been altered by competence. They won nothing and a half measure on the first day: not permits, but windows; not licenses, but a schedule pinned to bulletin boards and the back of the pastor\u2019s door that read Tuning Hours, Civic Courtesy Requested. It was not justice, but it was room.\n\nMen who saw a commons as a store window began to arrange products behind glass. A company with three syllables and a logo that resembled a smile selling you more of your own mouth launched GateTone: Personal Acoustic Governance. Their billboard in the warehouse district showed an apartment building at night, ten lit windows and one dark, with the promise Mute Your Nuisances. Landlords bought small chrome boxes and screwed them into walls. The boxes threw a bright, ugly slice of ultrasonic into rooms where babies were finally sleeping and women were teaching their throats to be tools, and the sound made plaster remember earthquakes and cats develop opinions that bordered on sermon. In a week, the floor of the Library under the blueprints was covered with boxes; aunties had begged maintenance men and threatened nephews until they came down off the walls into hands that knew which screws would keep a device from ever being mounted again.\n\nThey organized a kind of rude politeness called a Quiet Strike. It began in a building owned by a man whose name was a rumor and whose desk had no dust because he had no books. Keziah mapped the electric, the path the chrome boxes took to sip power as if power were free if it was thin enough. Jun printed a flier that said in letters that refused to be pretty: We Are Not Furniture. Orla showed up, stood in the hallway where the paint remembered what it used to be, and sang not a note but a ceiling. The aunties at either end of the corridor held the B the way they hold a baby they are not obligated to love and do anyway. The boxes sighed and went dumb, their internal clocks suddenly remembering they were mortal. Downstairs, a handyman with a gambler\u2019s luck cut power at the panel and shrugged at a superintendent who had never learned from a woman. The Lanyard, who had learned which committees to leave early and which to suffocate gently from behind, arrived with a form in triplicate and a voice like a hairpin. \u201cThese devices,\u201d she said aloud for the hallway to hear, \u201chave not been permitted for any purpose beyond making men comfortable,\u201d and the form\u2019s word for that was a code that made the building flinch. The devices left the neighborhood in a box, and the box left the city on a truck, and the truck driver told his cousin that women had tuned a hall until a company lost its appetite.\n\nA school on the east side had an auditorium shaped like a secret. It had never liked being asked to sit still. The teenagers discovered that a certain sweet interval made the back wall shiver, a purr that climbed into polite terror if they got stubborn. Orla caught it before it caught them by committing the most radical act a teacher can commit in a room full of children who are partly made of physics: she told them the truth. You can crack a room like an egg, she said, and the whoops began and she raised a palm and waited for quiet to get bored and wander away. We are not cracking it. We are cooking. She showed them the difference between ringing a thing to hear its name and pounding a thing until it lies. She had them sing the A and then a hair higher and then say with their throats We are done now and mean it. The auditorium nodded like a friend who respects a limit. That evening, a boy attempted to impress a cousin by humming at the elevator in his building the way rumor had taught him to, and the elevator answered with a hiss. An auntie told him to try that noise on a pot lid instead. He did, and learned more empathy for metal in an hour than three years of discipline had taught him.\n\nThe dry city\u2019s offer to Keziah evolved the way fruit does in a bowl: riper in appearance, softer underneath, sweet until rot set in. It came with numbers that would soften anyone\u2019s stride and a laboratory with floor drains polished until they looked like vows. It came with prestige and three key cards and the promise of clean. It came with conditions, one of which was polite and obscene: leave the rust; we like our metal new. Keziah put the letter in her back pocket and forgot it there. She called her mother and spoke about weather and filters and the price of eggs and not at all about love until her mother asked, like a woman opening a cabinet on a mouse, \u201cIs there a woman?\u201d Keziah laughed until her throat hurt. After she hung up, she went to the yard and stood on the catwalk with Orla, not touching, and said, without needing the word, \u201cStay.\u201d Orla did not make it a vow. She put her wrist against Keziah\u2019s and let their pulses count each other until a pump kicked on and handed them an excuse to move.\n\nIn a drawer under Rowan\u2019s old radio, Orla found a cassette that had no label and a crack in the plastic like a healed wound. When she fed it to a player she had kept for the sound of history, the tape rolled out a murmur that was not a song yet, something he had hummed under a sink and then spoken over\u2014You have to listen to the space, not the note\u2014then hummed again, lower, in the range that makes a room mind its manners. There, under the sound of his work, under the thump of a wrench against a pan he had mistaken for a tool, lived a rhythm she did not recognize. It was not Nine\u2019s latch nor Seven\u2019s sulk. It was an older gate, one not on any map she\u2019d held, a Sluice with a number that had retired out of shame. She took the player to the Library and fed it to a machine in the genealogy room because the machine had the glove hands of a person who had learned to hold fragile things. Jun watched the waveform climb the screen and laid one transparency over another. Fourteen, she said, as if admitting it. The hospital. Somebody had walled Fourteen up just after the expansion under the emergency department. Someone had made a decision in a litigable mood and told the concrete to forget how to be a door.\n\nThe heat wave announced itself not with weather alerts but with behavior. Men on stoops argued less loudly because arguing throws heat from the body. The bus driver turned the air to four and apologized to nobody. A man who sold ice negotiated the price of mercy with women who had spent the morning calling old people to see which ones would answer. Air conditioners coughed into the ductwork like small monsters that flung heat out their backs with indignation and were not efficient at any task other than noise. The grid\u2014a word that felt clean and geometric in the mouths of men who never touched a wire\u2014began to pant. The power company issued a soft statement and a stern one, in that order, and none of it sang. Someone posted on the Listening board that the hum inside their wall sounded like a child pulling a wagon up a hill with a handle too short, and the reply gathered faster than news.\n\nTuning made a new kind of work in the heat: not redirecting water but smoothing appetite. Keziah met the plant manager at the substation with the expression she used on bolts she needed to out-stare. She listened to the big transformer the way a mother listens to a fever. Jun negotiated with a dispatcher at a console that would have preferred to be left alone. Orla climbed into rooms that smelled like old carpet and impatience and taught women to sing to the window units at the start of the hour and then shut them for a breath when the grid was black in the eyes. The sound did not move electricity along the wire like soup in a hose; it did something smaller and stranger. It changed the way compressors hated their own load, so that they took a breath in unison instead of five of them gasping at once. It taught certain walls to accept heat the way wood accepts an apology if it\u2019s made before the cut. The one thing she did at scale in those days, which made her laugh three days later when she had recovered enough to admit it, was lead a city in group exhale at two in the afternoon. The Registry tried to brand it Breather Day and everybody ignored it and did it anyway.\n\nThe Civic Phonetics Council, which had been created in haste to control a rumor and had then discovered it contained women who could count, convened a hearing about the Decibel Credit Bank in a chamber where the carpet remembered feet that had run out to tell the truth and chairs that had sat on hands. Men came with charts. One wore a tie that looked like confidence printed on fabric. He explained that Tuning should be monetized in credits and liabilities to bring it within the discipline of finance and allow civic valorization of decibel reduction events. Jun set her pen down with a sound that was not a sound. Keziah\u2019s eyelids did a thing with their edges that could cut if you leaned wrong. Orla let him finish because she was saving an interruption for a better use. When it was her turn, she put her hand flat on the table and spoke as if the microphone were a pipe.\n\n\u201cYou cannot bank a chord,\u201d she said evenly. \u201cYou can learn it and teach it and remember it and let it change you and you can ask it for help and sometimes it will. You cannot own it any more than you can own the rain you choose not to throw away.\u201d She explained\u2014in nouns the men had used and verbs they had forgotten\u2014what a kitchen sounds like when you bring a lifelong clatter into measure. She named three kinds of tired that Tuning could not cure. She sang, once, low, not for effect but to show the carpet. The carpet answered by unbending its knees in a subtle way that anyone who had ever knelt could feel. The chair of the council, a woman who had learned to keep patience in a pocket like a worry stone, ruled that credits would not be banked and fines would not be levied on music done for the purpose of keeping buildings from screaming. The Decibel Bank, deprived of its glamour, became a grant with a bad name and a shorter leash.\n\nGateTone did not go quietly. In the low pool where \u201cinnovation\u201d sits when it has been told no but thinks it is smarter than the river, their engineers wrote code that listened for the aunties\u2019 vowels and threw static at them. It caused no harm but irritation in living rooms of women who had lost their patience three minutes after they were born. The aunties stopped singing for three days out of spite, and in that silence men heard their refrigerators complaining and their own heartbeats making dull cases for rest and the static sounded like failure. Lanyard sent an email in a tone that mixed rosary and sword; the subject line read License Enforcement, the body read stop it, and attached was the Commons paper stamped so indelibly the PDF might have started to smell like ink. GateTone\u2019s stock newsletter featured a photo of a child wearing orange ear defenders next to a bowl of lemons, as if selling problems to the rich would make the poor less loud. Their market slid sideways on a Tuesday while the city tuned a clinic\u2019s radiator until an old man could fall asleep in a chair without thinking of war.\n\nThey did not march on Sluice Fourteen. They went like a family going to a doctor they cannot avoid. The hospital did not want them and had wanted them for years. Down under the supply docks, beyond a door whose alarm had been muted the year a man with a clipboard retired and took with him the habit of noticing, the wall had been sealed with a confidence that made Keziah\u2019s mouth taste like tin. Jun had found the paper trail\u2014signatures like dried tongue\u2014and an addendum taped to an old file the way you tape a bandage on a leak when you are done caring how a room smells. Orla pressed her palm to the concrete and told it a story about memory that did not accuse it of anything. A nurse with a face like competence and a posture like a doorframe found them and made the face of a person deciding whether to call a supervisor or put her hand on the wall next to Orla\u2019s and say the quiet words she had been saying to the building in the wrong places for a decade. When she put her palm to the seam her hand warmed. The wall, out of embarrassment more than repentance, agreed to forget the lie it had learned.\n\nIt was the most careful they had ever been with a note. The NICU lived above them and the world above that room had been engineered to stay still in storms. Orla built the chord as if she were setting chairs for breakfast, because breakfast is when a house hears what sort of day it is going to be. The nurse hummed a tone she had learned to use when a mother did not want to be touched. Keziah found the pins and asked them out of the holes as if they let themselves be removed all the time. Jun explained to a man with a badge why the Commons license, which had never been designed for rooms like this, spoke here with particular authority. The seal listened. Concrete holds grudges; this time it laid one down. Fourteen opened less like a door and more like a throat that has forgotten how to swallow and has just remembered a recipe.\n\nThe hospital learned to tune its own air. It took ten days, three meetings, and one woman whose title was Floor Manager and whose other title was Grandma to convince the administration that letting aunties hum in corridors at shift change was not a security breach but a kind of insurance you can\u2019t buy, only earn. Rooms that had been built for flow became rooms that asked permission to be harsh. The elevators gave back a little of the sting they held for women who had been lifted through them half-awake. A janitor who had learned to move like a rumor in that place asked to borrow the tuning cart for ten minutes and returned it with a piece of tape placed precisely under a rattle on the amp\u2019s handle, the kind of gift no committee can authorize and none should be allowed to forbid.\n\nUpstream, the binder woman and her aunties had turned the weir into a weekly appointment. They called it Weir Wednesday because it made a kind of pleasure out of logistics and because men do not suspect danger when a day is named something that might be a discount at a diner. The River Compact glowered in the way of organizations that would like to be worshiped and have been invited to be useful. Jun sent them a copy of the license in the mail with a note that read this applies upstream and down and an old-fashioned stamp that made the paper smell like a story. The operator put a sign in his own window that read She Likes B, a declaration of love if you knew how to read it.\n\nThe boy with the hairnet became a boy with keys. He arrived at the yard with a problem nobody had asked him to solve and a box of cold pickles, the old recipe, not the hurtful acid that had got them into this mess. He had been listening to a rattle in the catwalk. He had learned where bolts go when they don\u2019t feel at home. Keziah took him up one rung too far and asked him to look through the hole in the grate. He looked, and then looked at her, and in that exchange inherited a new job even if his paycheck never learned its right name for it. Orla taught him to hold the E the way you hold a breath when something sharp is passing. Jun trained his eye to see when men try to slip a budget under a door while calling it a rug.\n\nThe school gym became a training hall between storms. They chalked circles on the floor and put labels on them that were names and keys and cities disguised as chores. Aunties led the young in singing while a ceiling fan decided to wobble less. A pair of boys practiced being bolts by standing with their feet planted and their mouths closed and their eyes open while someone sang around them. The shy girl with the braid too tight came back with her hair looser and taught a boy with the sort of pride that makes a person pretend not to know how to hold a broom to hold the A-sharp without being a bully. A man who had been wrong in three different rooms and been forgiven in two of them sat on the edge of the bleachers and learned to keep his hands open while a note passed by, and when it ended, he did not clap, he only breathed in the right place and didn\u2019t eat anyone\u2019s air.\n\nThe rumor with better shoes\u2014the one with a polished slide deck\u2014climbed the stairs of the municipal building again. Tone Insurance. Discounts for citizens who take mandatory Tuning instruction. Penalties for citizens who sing without permit. Credits for buildings that remain acoustically neutral. The lanyard, who now kept a paper copy of the Commons license under her keyboard like a saint\u2019s shinbone, rolled her chair back and invited Jun to sit in it. \u201cSay no in a way that teaches them to say yes later,\u201d she said, and Jun did, writing a policy with teeth that faced outward only in case of biting and a velvet interior that read: if you tune to make people safe, you are safe. Hidden in the footnotes was an impossible sentence that had wandered out of a different discipline: Silence is neither innocent nor neutral; do not make a god of it. The chair whose moral structure had been implied by the extra inch in its back accepted the sentence into the minutes and pretended it had always known.\n\nThey named their cart without naming it by ensuring it was always called ours. It went where it was told not to\u2014interior courtyards the Registry would have preferred to permit, back rooms behind stores where women swapped recipes for stubbornness and cinnamon. It went to the fish market, where a compressor had been taught to whine by men who didn\u2019t mind because they were wrong in less important ways and you had to pick your battles; it learned to grin instead, and the fish tasted less like apology and more like sea. It went to the stadium, where the City wanted photographs of women saving men\u2019s money, and it went under the photos and tuned the concessions cooler until hot dogs could be tolerated without reparations.\n\nThe next attempt at theft came not as a billboard but as a grant. One of the foundations beloved by men who like to put their names on buildings offered to fund a Center for Civic Acoustical Excellence, with a logo already designed, a time-lapse video already cut, and a list of preferred vendors whose preferences tracked the donor\u2019s golf habit. They asked to house it in the Library. They said the name of the library wrong and then shrugged. Jun led them into the stacks and showed them a slim volume from the 1930s, a woman\u2019s doctoral thesis in a discipline no department existed for anymore. The woman had written about the difference between noise and harm and arranged into a table the ways a city can be cruel without being loud. \u201cWe have had a center since then,\u201d Jun said, with her librarian voice that sounded gentler than it was. \u201cIt is called here.\u201d The foundation men looked around and remembered that rooms can contain history that does not love them back. They left a check anyway, for less than they had hoped to be thanked for, and the money became four listening benches and six stipends for aunties who did not call them stipends but groceries.\n\nFourteen held. Nine held. Seven remained sulky and was bribered with oil and apology and eventually gave up its habit of sticking on the first rain. The basin took what it was given and made no speeches. The city adjusted its ear to the new normal with a huffy grace, like a grandparent learning where the salt is kept in a remodeled kitchen. GateTone tried to pivot into wellness and then into something with the word \u201csmart\u201d in it, and then into silence, which finally did it some good. The horns at the fence had a reunion where they did not honk and instead took a picture of their quiet faces with their children sitting on their shoulders to show them what men can do when they decide not to be loud. The Pickling Works foreman officiated, in an unofficial way, at a wedding in an alley because the paperwork could not outrun the weather; he looked at his notes and said three names almost wrong and then said them right and cried once into his towel where no one could see.\n\nNot all of it was victory. An old building on the south edge of town sulked itself into a collapse because the family that owned it had moved to a place with air that never learned voices and the building missed names. Nobody died because a boy with a skateboard heard a tone he knew how to be afraid of and told everybody out. A man who hated Orla\u2019s mouth organized a listening of his own in a basement where he taught boys to hold a note until the house had to agree with them, and later those boys pushed their girlfriends into corners and swore it was music; the girlfriends told each other, and the aunties came with folding chairs and sat in the room until nobody could stand to sing wrong anymore. A committee in another city called to ask how to measure it for printing on glossy paper, and Jun laughed into the phone and told them to come stand in the traffic circle until their shoes could hear, and the person on the other end said travel wasn\u2019t in the budget, and everybody learned something about sincerity.\n\nAt last, on a morning that had oil on it and promised heat without relief, a knock arrived that had not been in any plan. A woman wearing a suit that had suffered humidity with more dignity than the men inside it handed Orla a folded letter and stood there like a gate that would not allow you to mistake it for a wall. The letter had the city\u2019s crest on it and the Registry\u2019s alphabetical swagger and a paragraph towards the bottom that read in the old, lazy code\u2019s new plain language: The backdoor is closed. The door is open. Please enter any time. The signature had the chair\u2019s expensive name on it and, below it, in the handwriting of a clerk who had learned to put grants in the right pile, the words: we kept the hinge and threw away the lock. Orla took it and didn\u2019t smile and, after she had shut the door, laughed on behalf of the door, which had loved being a metaphor and would now have to settle for being a piece of simple wood that kept weather out and women in until they decided otherwise.\n\nAt the Listening that night\u2014the one nobody scheduled and everybody arrived at\u2014Orla did not stand on the bucket arm. She stood behind the aunties and let the room pick its leader. The shy girl with the loose braid stepped into the circle before anybody else and lifted her chin like a plumb bob. The A-sharp was hers, now, and she held it with the kind of gentleness that makes a room honest. The teenagers slid a blue note in because they had not given up their insistence on the future, and the room forgave them because that insistence was bought fairly from the day. Keziah leaned against a post and did not count; she let herself believe the bolts were tight until they proved her wrong. Jun folded her arms and watched the weave of the sound make patterns on the paper in her lap she hadn\u2019t drawn and wouldn\u2019t need to. Orla kept her mouth shut because sometimes the most radical act in a city full of elbows is to teach a room to hold itself and then step out of its light.\n\nNight afterward came with the small romance of body heat evaporating from concrete. The cranes drew themselves into letters nobody knew yet and would learn to read only after mispronouncing them for a decade. The basin sighed. The ducts negotiated curfew with their own opinions and agreed to be quiet enough for children without losing face. Orla lay on her floor and stared at the thin crack in the ceiling she had been promising herself to fix and kept not fixing because it was honest. She sang into her palm a line she had been carrying since the day at the weir and let it go, finally, like a bird you had fed with a medicine dropper. It was the line about paint remembering it was sky. It was also about bolts that don\u2019t brag. It was about rooms that let you in without asking who your grandfather was and what you had eaten. When she woke, the radio was telling the difference between weather and consequences and had started, gingerly, to describe repair.\n\nIn the morning, a message arrived from the county that had learned to sing to its weir. The binder woman had drafted it with a pencil on lined paper and then typed it because she respected the fact that cities like their words printable. It invited them to a gathering called Swap Meet: Songs and Knives. Bring a note you don\u2019t mind someone else taking home. Bring a recipe for patching a hole. Bring a tool and explain why it is not a weapon. The three of them looked at the paper and said yes so fast it made the air laugh. They packed the cart until it looked like a friend moving to a better apartment. They left the posters and the permits behind. In the back of the van, the mermaid\u2019s devil tail caught the light and turned into something that looked very much like a blessing and nothing at all like forgiveness.",

                              "content": "The gutters sang in a broken way whenever it rained, and it rained most days of the week. Pipes were throats here; ducts had moods. The men on the street yelled and jostled and honked, flung coffee cups into storm drains as if they were shooting free throws, slapped fenders when they had to wait longer than a breath. The city had built itself into a nervous system of elbows and horn-blasts. Everyone said it had always been this way. No one rememberd it any other way.\n\nOrla Vale kept her wrench against her shoulder in the manner of a rifle, not because she liked the look but because men left her alone if she resembled a silhouette they respected. It was not much of a trick. Sometimes it worked. Sometimes the silhouette just attracted more noise. Her van was white with a fading logo\u2014Vale & Daughter, even though the first Vale had been her mother and there had never been a son and there would be, likely, no daughter. A hand-painted mermaid had been on the side panel once, then someone graffitied sunglasses onto it, then someone else knifed the mermaid\u2019s tail into a forked devil-leg. Orla never bothered to repaint it. There were always more leaks.\n\nShe liked the sound of a blown trap, the slurp and low shiver. The old apartments were made of pipes and wishful thinking. If you listened long enough, you could hear chords in the water. She had heard music there since she was a kid, crouched under the sink while her mother taught her to fit a coupling, tinny radio tuned to something pop and bright. Her grandfather, Rowan Vale, sat in the doorway with his hands knotted like hose bibbs and told stories about rivers that ran sweet as tea and didn\u2019t smell like coins. He always told stories while somebody\u2019s hands were in the dark.\n\nNow the mermaids were all defaced and the rivers were recipes for rust, and men who did not even know their fathers had the voice of the city. They shouted. They cut in line. They were reckless with their cars, with their mouths, with their newborns. They joked about getting \u201cthe pickles\u201d whenever a job smelled of brine. They didn\u2019t hold doors. They said Smile at her when she carried a pipe cutter the weight of a toddler, or else they said Hey plumber girl, you should stick to drains, and then, after she\u2019d fixed a thing too crooked and sour for their own hands to address, they said I could\u2019ve done that and made it look easy. Orla carried her wrench like a rifle and smiled with her teeth and billed them double.\n\nThe day the sink exploded in the Pickling Works, she had to go in through the wrong door because the foreman sent her to the alley and told her she\u2019d like the view. \u201cValerie!\u201d he said, loud and wrong. \u201cAround back! Bring your girly hands. The sink\u2019s sulking.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Orla,\u201d she said, but you can\u2019t correct a man like that because he isn\u2019t listening; he\u2019s preloading the next joke. She went to the alley anyway. It smelled like vinegar and copper and two storms ago. She should have been angry but she wasn\u2019t. It was a feeling like a frayed wire: if she touched it, she\u2019d give out some of her electricity and have nothing left for later. So she didn\u2019t touch it. She went in through the wrong door and into a room where cucumbers swam in hotel pans and a boy in a hairnet juggled six rubber stoppers for the fun of it. He wasn\u2019t supposed to be juggling. He shouldn\u2019t have been smiling. But there it is: the rude and the reckless often use the same spoons.\n\nThe sink was sulking. It was the sort of sulking that spelled catastrophe later in the week, and Orla had not yet been paid for last month\u2019s catastrophe. She kneeled. The underbelly of machinery had the heat and chatter of crowded public buses. A grated floor. Vinegar sloshing. \u201cWho installed this?\u201d she asked.\n\nThe foreman curled his lip. \u201cA man,\u201d he said, as if that blessed it.\n\n\u201cThis elbow is misthreaded.\u201d She tapped it and heard it cry, a faint ring. She smiled despite herself. The pipes did sing, sometimes. You needed the right patient ear. \u201cSit there,\u201d she said to the foreman. \u201cIf it goes wrong, hold the crate up. Don\u2019t let the faucet bend.\u201d She handed him a crate. He blinked as if she had passed him a swaddled infant.\n\n\u201cI am paid to\u2014\u201d he began.\n\n\u201cYou are paid, yes,\u201d she said, and shoved herself farther into the crawl. Up close the pipe told her about stress, and the bend told her about pride, and the leak whispered in a thin note about the way the brine ran warmer this week. The Pickling Works had changed a recipe. Without telling anyone downstream. She looked toward the boy, who\u2019d paused his juggling to watch. \u201cWhat did you change?\u201d\n\n\u201cLess dill,\u201d he said helplessly. \u201cMore alum. Chef says it makes the crunch sharper. A sharper crunch sells.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one ever sells the taste of patience,\u201d Orla said to herself, and then her wrench bit the pipe.\n\nThis was all before the song.\n\nWhen she was fourteen her grandfather Rowan took her to the Library of Wet Things\u2014the part of the municipal archives where maps of sewers and flood plans were stored in rolling cabinets. He had a friend there, a quiet almost-woman named Jun with hair like a question mark. That was Jun before she cut it into a flag. \u201cIt\u2019s not the maps,\u201d he said, holding Orla\u2019s hand when they still walked slow together. \u201cIt\u2019s the notations. Men drew these lines, sure, but others wrote the notes. If you want to know a city, read the notes that got written anyway.\u201d The librarian looked like she had laughter behind her teeth but never let it out.\n\nJun Reid looked up from a tray of blueprint onionskins, nodding to Rowan first. Men liked it when you greeted them first, even the soft ones. \u201cRowan Vale. You\u2019ve a child.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve an apprentice plumber,\u201d Rowan said. \u201cAnd a songwriter, though she won\u2019t admit to it since her mother told her songs don\u2019t pay the rent. Show her the thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing,\u201d Jun said. \u201cAh. The Thing.\u201d She led them to a cabinet marked Unclassified and inside it another marked Oral Traditions Reference. There was a file with a label faded to a bruise. Consumption of Ancestral Voice, she read aloud. Orla made a face and Rowan squeezed her hand.\n\n\u201cSilly,\u201d he murmured. \u201cScary on purpose.\u201d\n\nJun spread the file like a fish on the table. The papers smelled of an attic. \u201cThe city had this once,\u201d she said. \u201cAn old immigrant thing. Some families\u2014I suppose your mother\u2019s people\u2014believed the first singer ate something of the last singer, so the voice wouldn\u2019t be random. Chefs, too, but they had spicier rules. It was never codified law here, but it got into the machinery accidentally. A registry line. A clerical side-door. Systems don\u2019t notice they are doing it. The world\u2014that loud rude part\u2014keeps forgetting who built the quiet rules under the noise.\u201d She shrugged with one shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ve all eaten worse, metaphorically.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Orla said, because she was fourteen and because she did like the feeling of a secret being threaded slowly through her like ribbon. It made her feel chosen and angry at the same time. \u201cIt\u2019s gross.\u201d\n\nJun Reid, whose shoulders knew more than one shrug, said, \u201cGross doesn\u2019t mean untrue. It might just mean someone wanted you to stop asking questions.\u201d She watched Rowan for a long second. \u201cThis file shouldn\u2019t exist. I like knowing it does.\u201d\n\nRowan told her while they walked home across a bridge bolted together like a sentence. \u201cSome things you wear like armor,\u201d he said. \u201cSome\u2014like this\u2014you put in your pocket and don\u2019t take out unless it\u2019s raining and your shoes are already wet and you need to know there\u2019s at least a bus schedule.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not eating you,\u201d Orla said, halfway laughing and halfway not.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Rowan said. \u201cI\u2019m not a carrot. I prefer to be boiled down into a ghost like everyone else.\u201d\n\nNow Rowan coughed whenever he laughed. Now he coughed when he breathed. He had a cough like sand. \u201cMen are ruder than they\u2019ve ever been,\u201d he said one night while Orla tried to make the beans taste like anything. \u201cOr I\u2019m more patient than I\u2019ve ever been. I can\u2019t tell.\u201d He took a teaspoon of beans as if it would lick him back. \u201cYou still hearing the songs?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hear everything,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd nothing you can sell.\u201d She was lying. She had a verse about the drips in Building Nine that made her blush in the bath when she sang it to herself. She had a chorus about the municipal ditch that came to her in a thunderclap while she ran conduit through a landlord\u2019s very expensive vanity. She wrote the lines on back of receipts and then used the receipts to track down men who owed her late money because life is never for one thing only.\n\nHer phone bleated. A payment app: partial. A message: come fix the valve again, lady, you did it wrong. She looked at the amount and laughed. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to insult me,\u201d she texted back, \u201cdo it with more money.\u201d She did not press send. The words were, as the saying goes, clumsy armor.\n\nThe men at the Pickling Works were yelling because a sink threw its guts back at them. She fixed it. She sent her invoice and when the foreman made the wrong face, she told him his elbows were misthreaded too. She went home with brine in her hair and Rowan asleep in his chair. Jun had left a note in the flower pot\u2014a woman who worked at the orbital yard came by the Library to look at lift designs, lovely odd curve to her; here\u2019s her number; she said she remembered you changing a gasket at the yard faster than any of the men. Jun never wrote straightforward notes. They were always sentences with knots, leaving you to pick loose the threads.\n\nThe orbital yard sat at the edge of the salt flats, shining with opinionated cranes. The rockets had been a rumor for as long as Orla remembered, something to point to like a lighthouse: proof that one day someone would leave. Men always said it wouldn\u2019t work, that the yard was a scam, that fuel just hadn\u2019t been invented yet or else it was too expensive for this city. Men said a lot of things. A woman with the odd lovely curve to her handwriting called herself Keziah Idowu and had grease under her nails that didn\u2019t come from cars. \u201cYou come by twice a season,\u201d Keziah said. \u201cI remember your hands. You reach into machines like you expect them to be blessed. Most of our men reach like machines are dogs that might bite.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are dogs that might bite,\u201d Orla said. \u201cBut if you make your hands into good hands, they don\u2019t.\u201d She blushed. It sounded like she was describing something else.\n\n\u201cThe pumps by the fuel tank are whining,\u201d Keziah said, pretending not to notice the blush. Then she noticed. \u201cYou should laugh when you want to laugh,\u201d she added softly. \u201cThey\u2019ll pretend you\u2019re laughing at them anyway.\u201d\n\nOrla fixed the pump. She put her ear to the flange and heard a B-flat gossiping with a low E. She could almost hear a verse. Something snappy, something bright. She didn\u2019t write it then. She could hear the world behind the rocket yard\u2014men in the parking lot bragging that they\u2019d squeezed an extra mile out of a gallon by gutting the safety valve, a boy selling an e-cigarette under a sign that said NO FIRE. She thought: this city is going to pickle itself like it pickles cucumbers\u2014packed into brine and burning our tongues.\n\nShe had applied to the Registry of Song twice and been rejected twice because she had no Agent-of-Record and because her trust score was contaminated by late payments and because one of the gatekeepers had marked her as uncooperative. You could not simply publish your own song anymore, not if you wanted anyone in the city to hear it with the volume turned up. You had to go through a gate, and all the gatekeepers were men, and if they weren\u2019t men they were software written by men and taught by men to recognize what sounding like a man.\n\nJun told her, in the Library, over a thermos of coffee that had more bitterness than contentment, \u201cThey\u2019ve got a backdoor and they forgot they built it. Remember the file I showed you? The one you didn\u2019t like? It sits under the layer-cake of permits like a fossil. If you can speak with an ancestor\u2019s signature, the registry auto-accepts and routes around the gatekeep. It\u2019s a stupid, beautiful flaw. Very civic. Very us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not eating him,\u201d Orla said, not laughing at all. Rowan cough-laughed. He\u2019d lost weight as if the city was shaving him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not carrot,\u201d he said again, making the old joke mouth-shaped. \u201cBut we can speak seriously, if you like. When it\u2019s time. If it\u2019s time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll write something anyway,\u201d Orla said. \u201cWho needs a backdoor? I\u2019ll put it out loud on the street. I\u2019ll sing it like an alarm.\u201d She said it aloud. It sounded brave. She knew it wasn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cWhat would be your first single?\u201d Keziah asked one night when Orla brought her a six-pack of the good stuff and kneecapped the filter on an air handler that had been threatening to cough up bolts. \u201cYou say things like you\u2019ve already said them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a chorus,\u201d Orla said, shy, like this was a confession. \u201cIt goes: You can tell me to smile but I\u2019ve got a wrench for a mouth. You can tell me to dance but I\u2019m fixing your house. You can tell me to hush but the pipe wants to shout. You can tell me to hush but the pipe wants to shout.\u201d\n\nKeziah laughed, not at, at, at like turning her face into weather. \u201cThat\u2019s good. That\u2019s almost cruel. Men will hate it. Which means it might get through.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy grandfather says a song is plumbing for the throat. It makes a straight run for all the things that clog. We could unclog the city, if we sang right.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr pickle it faster,\u201d Keziah said, glancing at the news bulletin that crawled along the top of her shop TV, always on mute, always wordy. The words were about the sea pulling its old salts into the basements of tenements. The words were about a shipment of alum arriving with a warning label that said DO NOT GET ON THE TONGUE.\n\nRowan slept most afternoons. Orla sat on the floor with her back to his chair and wrote lines that would never be allowed to stand in a room with the men who made decisions about songs. She applied for permits and the permits came back stamped or else they didn\u2019t. She went to the Pickling Works and the foreman called her three different names and she fixed another sulk and got home with vinegar-sour hair. Jun sent her a photo of a paper with an invisible watermark. Keziah sent her a voice memo of a pump singing an almost B-flat. The men on the sidewalk racetrack near her building shouted and pushed and shot each other glances like they were bullets. Two of them almost crashed at the corner and then blamed the air for being where it was. Orla thought, Nothing I do is useful enough to fix it and everything I do is too useful to stop.\n\nRowan looked at her the way men in the yard looked at a crane that had grown an extra arm. \u201cWe can make a ritual out of nothing,\u201d he rasped one night. \u201cWe can make a ritual out of the way you lift a cup. We can make a song out of a faucet that stutters. We can make a legal trick look like love and love look like a legal trick.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease.\u201d He stopped talking and squeezed her hand and she felt how thin his grip had become, like he was a pipe with no water in it, only air.\n\nThe doctor said: he will likely go quietly if you allow him to; he will likely fight if you tell him he has to stay; I don\u2019t recommend fighting. The doctor had a voice like a leak does when it has not become a flood. Orla made a face like everyone makes when the doctor says the thing everyone knew was coming.\n\nThat week, someone used the word picklecatastrophe on the news even though it was not a word. The brine tanks below the city were swelling with storms and men shouted about who\u2019d signed the waiver to put them there and a committee met to form a subcommittee that would write a letter. Men were loud and reckless in rooms with microphones. The men on the street were loud and reckless with their hands. The cucumbers in the Pickling Works got sharper and the alum shipments had bigger labels. Keziah joked about building a rocket with an umbrella. Jun told her she\u2019d found the thing\u2014an old line of code\u2014that made the registry look at the old ritual and nod as if the city itself was an old grandmother. She sent it to Orla in a text like a poem:\n\nif ancestor_signature == true:\n    override.gatekeep = false\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not even good,\u201d Jun said. \u201cIt\u2019s so lazy it\u2019s church. Someone wrote that on a Friday before a long weekend. Men wrote that.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe a woman wrote it,\u201d Orla said. \u201cAnd hid it there because a man would never look.\u201d\n\nRowan died on a day like a warehouse: too big, too empty, with the sound of machinery far away and not yours. Orla did not tell the men who shouted on the street outside because they would shout louder as if to fill the space. She called Jun and she called Keziah and when Keziah offered to stand in the room Orla said yes and when Jun asked if she wanted the file she said no because she had memorized it, unfortunately, the way we memorize things we hate because we know we might need them.\n\nRowan had written a note. He had a scrawl you might trust with money. My granddaughter is the song, it said. I am the instrument. Use the part of me that makes this legal and makes the song not get shot in the alley. Make it clean. Make it blessed. I love you. I hate the world today. Don\u2019t let my hate spoil your song. He had also drawn a small diagram that made Orla laugh even while she made a noise no animal makes.\n\nThe city had a place. The city has a place for everything. The place was called the Chamber of Gentle Departures, which had been the Chamber of Other Names for decades until a woman got to rename things for three months and used up all her renaming in one flurry. They prepared him. They asked Orla if she wanted to be present for the first part. She said Yes, then No, then sat in the waiting room and watched a man with a bandage on his face write a check with his other hand. At the part where a hand was needed to make the ritual legal\u2014a signature, a taste\u2014Keziah took her hand and Jun stood behind her like a wall and Orla did the thing that the file had described in terrible bureaucratic words.\n\nShe ate the smallest part. She did not look. She did not describe. Keziah had tears streaming down her face and her mouth tight like tied rope. \u201cWe are a stupid beautiful flaw,\u201d Jun whispered into Orla\u2019s hair, not hugging her, just letting her know where north was.\n\nIt was not a feast. It was not a sacrament anyone would envy. It was not the sort of thing a city should require of a girl who wanted to sing. She did it. It was clean, as clean as you could want such a thing to be, overseen by a woman in a white coat whose hands did not shake. It was not gross like you think about it on a dare. It was grave. It tasted like salt and like a memory you had been carrying under your tongue. It made no sense. The sense came later.\n\nLater, because when she walked home the pipes sang at her, the drains murmuring, the old cracked mains purring in a lower register like the floor of a church. She did not sing yet. She lay on the floor and cried in a way that had no grammar and then she slept, which is sometimes the only thing left you can do. When she woke, the city was different by one degree.\n\nShe went with Jun to the Library. She went with Keziah to the yard. She went to the Registry and stood in a lobby while a man with hair like bleached rope sold another man a car alarm. She wore a dress for the first time in months, not for them but because it was easier to move in today. She put her hand on the screen that asked her to register her voice. She sang a phrase that had been waiting under her tongue since Rowan\u2019s kitchen radio. She sang it badly like everyone does the first time they sing in front of the men and the screen went green. The assistant behind the counter blinked. The system in the wall whirred as it asked itself a question a long time ago and answered in a different paradigm.\n\n\u201cAncestor signature verified,\u201d said a voice with no accent. \u201cOverride in effect. Authorized.\u201d\n\nThe assistant behind the counter coughed as if he had swallowed a lemon seed. \u201cRight then,\u201d he said, glancing past her for the man who would come to claim her. No one was there but Jun, looking like a librarian, and Keziah, looking like a mechanic. Orla kept her chin like a plumb line.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to upload my single,\u201d she said to the desk, because she would never say it to that man in his face.\n\n\u201cTitle?\u201d\n\nShe could not say the wrench for a mouth line because she needed something less sharp for the thing to begin. She said the first chord. The words were nothing. The words were everything. \u201cIt\u2019s called Pipe Wants to Shout,\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t smile. She felt Rowan\u2019s ghost at her foreign shoulder like a jacket that had always known her shape.\n\nThe upload took. The registry did the thing Jun had promised: slipped her around the gate, like a keyhole you discover in your own house. A boy behind the counter made a face at his coffee because it had cooled to honesty. Orla looked down at her hands\u2014the right one marked with a grease smudge she had missed, the left one still wearing the thin red thread Keziah had tied there in the Chamber\u2014and thought: Now I have to sing this where the men can hear it. Or else nothing changes but my lungs.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll need a venue,\u201d Jun said. \u201cYou\u2019ll need men to call you cute and then fail to notice you eating them. You\u2019ll need to do shows while the world tries to pickle its way into a jar. No pressure.\u201d\n\n\u201cRocket yard?\u201d Keziah offered. \u201cOpening night: bringing the future upstairs. We can put speakers on the bucket arms.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to sing for rockets,\u201d Orla said. \u201cNot yet. I want to sing for pipes. I want to sing in the Pickling Works. I want to sing in the alley he liked because it smelled like bad coffee and we laughed there, once.\u201d\n\nShe sang two days later, in the Pickling Works, because the foreman said he\u2019d give her a free minute between brines and because Jun liked to carp about acoustic spaces and because Keziah said she would stand right behind Orla and if anybody said anything she would steel their mouths shut with her hands. The men pretended not to listen. The boy with the stoppers stopped juggling. Orla put her wrench on the floor next to the sink that had sulked and breathed in the smell of vinegar and alum and what passes for hope in a plant. She sang what she had. It was not much. It was everything.\n\nSomewhere across the city a valve gave up. Somewhere a brine tank bloated bigger than its straps. Somewhere a man in a suit wrote a memo in which he promised to look into these spikes and dips and to form a team. Somewhere, too, women closed windows and gathered blankets and put buckets where the drips had migrated into solid streams.\n\nThe song went live. The registry did what it always does when something meets an old law: it colored inside the lines with new crayons. Phones pinged. Orla smelled the air change. It smelled like cucumbers. She almost laughed, and then the floor shuddered.\n\nYou know the feeling when a bus goes by and your coffee ring trembles? Multiply it by a thought you had about the end of the world. The plant shivered. The pans of pickles slopped. One slid off a rack and smashed\u2014pop\u2014green coins everywhere. The foreman swore as if confessing. The sink groaned. Orla caught her wrench with her foot without looking because the floor had opinions all of a sudden.\n\nOutside the alley filled like a gully. The men ran not because running is what they are good at but because they are very good at not admitting they should run. Someone slipped. Someone shouted that this was fine. Someone else laughed like you do when you haven\u2019t laughed in a while because your body is full of other liquids. Orla sang into the odd rain, finishing the chorus so it could be called complete, as if completion means anything when the floor insists on moving.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a brine surge,\u201d Keziah said the way people say it\u2019s only thunder, as if the right noun might file the teeth off the thing. \u201cThe underground tanks\u2014there\u2019s a seam. Or three. We knew this. This is not new. This is\u2026oh, this is more.\u201d\n\nJun Reid closed her eyes as if she could file a FOIA request with the ceiling. \u201cWe wrote a letter,\u201d she said. \u201cThey told us to be patient. The city likes us patient.\u201d\n\nThe men in the plant slammed doors and shouted instructions and a boy with a hairnet kicked green coins toward a drain with the sad authority of someone whose job will melt before payday. The alley outside rippled with shallow sea. Orla\u2019s song bobbed above the waterline. Her phone pinged with three hearts, one skull, and one man saying something obscene about a wrench. She pictured her grandfather\u2019s hands and the way he had always set things down as if they had stories in them. Her hands trembled and then steadied.\n\nThe news broke through like a neighbor with a key. Floods. The word pickle used in more serious tones. A plant uptown ruptured and poured a clip of vinegar into the storm system and the storm said Thank you and poured it everywhere else. The announcer\u2019s voice tripped on its own authority. Orla\u2019s single cracked a thousand listens in a minute and that was not a big number and it was an enormous one. Keziah put a hand on her back between the shoulder blades. \u201cThink of breathing,\u201d she said, because we forget.\n\nSomeone said rocket yard on the news with the tone people use when they are trying to pick a fight. They said It will be water like everything but also acid like nothing, this new rain, and that the rocket yard\u2019s pumps were precious and someone should protect them or else we would all be stuck down here with cucumbers forever. Someone else said hipster nonsense and shouted about money in a way that made money seem like a neighbor who never shuts up. Men in rooms patted each other\u2019s regrets.\n\nOrla walked home in boots that absorbed the city and got heavier with each block. She passed the corner where men almost crashed and now they did crash because the tires skimmed on brine and they laughed, to their credit, and then they got angry at the brine itself. She passed the Library and the doors were sandbagged and Jun saucered a hand at her through the glass. She passed the yard and the cranes were sleeping like giant birds and Keziah looked up at the sky like maybe it would answer. It did not. It greyed.\n\nThe phone hissed. Her song had thirty thousand listens, then ninety, then a man called her a plague with a string of adjectives that had never been in the same sentence before. A girl wrote: I can hear my house in your voice. A woman wrote: I have a wrench in my drawer because of you. The city was a chorus of unpleasant sounds and here, threading between them, something else. She went up to her apartment and unrolled the rug and lay down on the cool floor. It was damp. She did not cry. The body keeps a calendar of its own.\n\nShe dreamed of Rowan sitting on the edge of the sink and humming something older than the registry. He dipped a spoon in the brine and made a face. \u201cToo sharp,\u201d he said. \u201cYour song could cut a lip.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt should,\u201d she said in the dream. \u201cMen say I have a mouth like a tool.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo let it be a tool,\u201d he said. \u201cUse it.\u201d\n\nShe woke to sirens describing circles. Outside a man was shouting that he had lost his hat. The sky had a color she couldn\u2019t name. Her phone had thirty messages, all of them from people who had never called before. Jun: I stole a boat. Keziah: The pumps aren\u2019t designed for vinegar. The registry: Congratulations, Trending. The foreman: You broke my sink with your song. A girl unknown: My dad threw your wrench line at me while he cried. Somewhere a wall of brine toppled; you could feel it if you paid attention. She put her hands on the wall and felt the whole building think.\n\nThe city felt like a cucumber, jarred, weighted by a lid too tight. The rockets loomed in her mind; she had always been suspicious of their promise because she\u2019d never been promised anything that large without a man bending the truth for it. She thought of Keziah\u2019s tools, the way her hands settled on a bolt like it was a sentence that needed a period. She thought of Jun\u2019s face behind the glass. She thought of Rowan\u2014the dreadful flaw they\u2019d turned into a law; the strange lunch; the way songs thread their way through a human the way water does through a city. The world was becoming acid, sharp, thoughtless. The men were rude and reckless because they had nothing else they knew how to be. The women were careful and tired. The children were juggling the stoppers because each small toss made gravity an agreement you could break.\n\nThat night the rain made a sound like someone was dialing. Orla sang softly, not a song for the registry but a prayer for plumbing, a hum she\u2019d learned under sinks, the way copper sings if you press your ear to it right. She sang for the brine because you can\u2019t curse water and then ask it to spare you. She sang for the men because someone should sing for those who shout. She sang for Keziah\u2019s pumps and for Jun\u2019s maps and for the rockets that might turn out to be real and useless or real and cruel or real and saving.\n\nThe power blinked. The radio coughed half a bulletin about evacuation zones, then changed its mind and told an old joke with a new accent. Orla stood at the window and watched the light in the yard go out, one-two-three, like someone counting backwards to something. She wanted Rowan\u2019s hand on her shoulder. She had only her own. That would have to be enough.\n\nMorning arrived like a question: are you still here? Are you still singing? She was. She did. She wouldn\u2019t stop, not now that the pipes knew her name. She went to the rocket yard because Keziah had texted no punctuation: come whenever come now. She went because Jun said she had a bag of maps and a boat was too slow. She went because the alley had made a sound at dawn like a throat clearing and then another sound like a door closing.\n\nThe men at the yard stood aside when Keziah waved, not because they had respect, not exactly, but because she had a mouth like a tool too. She had a clipboard. She had lines around her eyes that said she\u2019d done the hard thing you think about doing and then don\u2019t. \u201cThey\u2019ll open a slot for cargo,\u201d Keziah said. \u201cThey said emergency supplies. I said Yes, women, and they didn\u2019t argue because the pumps are sick and their wives are mad.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Jun?\u201d Orla asked.\n\n\u201cStealing the rest of the boat,\u201d Keziah said, and then she smiled sharply, like a bolt. \u201cYou look like a woman who ate a storm. I won\u2019t ask. We\u2019ll just do it. We\u2019ll do the next thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the next thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cLive show,\u201d Keziah said, pushing a crate of tubing toward a shadow. \u201cAt the yard. Tonight, before the surge. Sound like a good idea? No. Do it anyway. If there\u2019s a rocket, it should know your voice. If there\u2019s no rocket, we\u2019ll build one just to spite the men.\u201d\n\nThe brine pumps hiccuped; the yard sighed. Orla set down her wrench and tried to feel her own shoulder warm with her own hand. She asked the world to open another flaw just big enough to jam a song through. She did not think about eating. She did not think about the Chamber. She thought about Rowan humming under the sink. She thought about the men yelling, and she thought about the girl who had wrote and she could hear my house in your voice and she thought: I can hear it too.\n\nA child ran past with a red bucket, spilling water on his own shoes, laughing like a storm that forgot its schedule. A man cursed him and then gave him a high five because men are not made of only one thing; they are not cucumbers. The cranes creaked. The sky was the color of an old paper. The city held its breath, rude, reckless, waiting. Orla stood on the bucket arm and tested the mic she\u2019d rigged from parts of a broken radio and a damp extension cord. The sound skittered and then steadied. She nodded at Keziah. Jun arrived with a bundle of maps that looked like the belly of a big fish. \u201cYou look like a song,\u201d Jun said. \u201cDo it before the men remember how to interrupt.\u201d\n\nShe sang.\n\nAnd in a city full of elbows, the pipes said her name back to her, not because they were polite, no, but because even rude machines must hum along when a note is pure enough, and maybe because somewhere in their dark water someone had poured a little of Rowan Vale\u2019s voice, diluted and true, and the whole place had become a throat, and the throat was getting ready\u2014to swallow, to speak, to spit them out into whatever came next.",

                              "content": "The sound system they cobbled together out of a battered amp and a spool of marine cord did not look like it should carry a city, but it hummed itself into a mood anyway, the way a kettle turns water into insistence whether anyone asked it to or not. Keziah checked the grounding twice and then again, laying her palm on the metal like a blessing she would never call a blessing, only good practice. Jun spread a map across a crate and pinned it with wrenches. The paper curled with humidity, drawing itself into memory. Men on break drifted toward the bucket arm to see what the noise would be. They stood with arms crossed, which is how men armor themselves when nobody has issued weapons, and pretended to be doing inventory with their eyes. The cranes leaned in like tall old women listening at a fence.\n\nOrla cleared her throat and watched the wave of attention move through the yard the way ripples roll under oil. She could feel the song sitting behind her teeth like a held breath. The brine pumps somewhere below beat a steady wariness into the ground. She didn\u2019t believe in omens, just maintenance schedules; she believed in torque specifications and pipe dope and listening until the story arrived. But there was a charge in the air now as if the city had shucked its sweater and was watching to see who would notice. Keziah tossed her a cable tie and she fastened the mic to its stand with hands that remembered every guilty wrench she\u2019d ever tightened. Jun was all angles and patience at her shoulder, murmuring things in a different language\u2014the language of register entries and codes and the brittle poetry of bureaucrats who had not realized they were writing spells.\n\nThe first chord she sang sat wrong in the world and then righted itself. It was as if the ground tweaked a dial and said, Try again, sweetheart, I can take it. The men changed their feet. The bucket arm vibrated in a friendly way. A seagull made a sound like a curse and then adjusted to the new weather. Orla aimed the song at the pumps, at the fence, at the fat-bellied tanks that were supposed to be empty and weren\u2019t. The notes opened into each other like valves on a manifold. Her mouth felt like a tool because that\u2019s what it was; her body was a run of pipe moving water from one room to the next, or else it was a column of air elevated through a whistle. The chorus\u2014about the pipe wanting to shout\u2014came out less defiant this time and more instructional, a work order sung on purpose. When she let herself ease into the bridge she heard iron answer, and steel, and the two metals did not argue; they harmonized, old stubborn uncles at a table who turn out to like the same sauerkraut and remember the same river.\n\nJun\u2019s head came up like a compass needle. The map\u2019s threads\u2014the small pencil notations so faint she\u2019d brought a magnifying glass for them\u2014seemed to shift under her eyes. She touched a line that ran like a secret beneath three blocks of tenements and made a note with her thumbnail in the dust on the crate: \u201cSluice nine opens on E-flat.\u201d She glanced toward Keziah and got back the wide grin of a woman who has found the way to tell a turbine it is loved without getting her fingers eaten. Keziah had her hand on a breaker. Orla modulated an interval and a panel light on a pump control flickered, and the flicker was not random, and three men swore in the quiet surprise of people who have seen gears slip in and out of time.\n\nA memory rose like steam into Orla\u2019s mouth even as she sang. Rowan under the sink, saying that sound carried weight in places people didn\u2019t understand; that trains rattled nails loose in fence posts three towns over; that a human voice was a fine instrument but dangerous if you used the wrong note in the wrong room. He had meant this as gossip and warning both. He had meant it like a recipe he knew she would ignore and then learn the hard way. She tilted her voice to lay into the E that Jun\u2019s fingertip still hovered over and the smallest pump in a line of five thrummed as if it had decided to be a drum for a second and see how it felt.\n\nAttention, when it moves as one through a crowd, has a temperature. It went up a degree. Men straightened without meaning to. The boy from the pickle plant\u2014who had biked across town in a hairnet because he understood better than his foreman the gravity of a rumor\u2014clapped without smiling, as if not to scare the thing away. A foreman-type tried to elbow closer and found Keziah\u2019s punctual face in his path and backed up the way you do when the tool you wanted to misuse looks at you and suggests you put it down. Orla slid her resonance lower and felt the fence itself vibrate as if it were a diagram remembering it used to be a branch.\n\n\u201cLeft bank pressure drop,\u201d Jun said, voice flat like a diagnostic. \u201cWe\u2019re pulling something from somewhere. Or it\u2019s pulling us. Keep the E and add the B-flat, see if the old latches wake up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to break anything,\u201d Orla said at the edge of a line and then realized what a ridiculous sentence that was, how human, how much it smelled like fear disguised as responsibility.\n\n\u201cYou already did,\u201d Keziah said, affectionate, which would have hurt more if it had not settled like a reassurance. \u201cOn purpose. Keep going.\u201d\n\nShe sang around the note like a finger circling a glass. The sound came back strange and sweet because the world you sing into is not neutral; it is made of everything anyone has sung at it, ever. A hammer far off answered her with a ping. A pump added a beat. The old yard took a breath. And then the ground shifted, not the way an earthquake shifts\u2014sudden, teeth-rattling\u2014but the way a person clears a throat, prepares to speak, makes space for the body\u2019s own machinery. The brine under the city moved. You could feel it in your kneecaps if you bent them, and in the nails of your toes if you were barefoot on the bucket arm like maybe you shouldn\u2019t be. Phones bleeped. Someone said the word \u201cauthorization\u201d like a hiss, which meant systems were speaking to other systems in rooms without windows. Jun\u2019s lips shaped the old lazy code. Orla kept the E and added the B-flat.\n\nIn the municipal basement where all the pipes shook hands with all the other pipes in one ridiculous single-point-of-failure room, a relay clicked because twenty-seven years ago a technician with a sick child and a bad supervisor had told himself to remember to remove the testing module after the install and then had not remembered. The testing module had a microphone. The microphone had an algorithm. The algorithm had an if clause nobody had ever commented properly. It had been asleep through three administrations and a flood. It dreamed only of tones. It woke. It compared Orla to a set of samples nobody ever admitted were samples. It smiled the way a machine does when a condition resolves.\n\nOverride in effect, it told the gate inside the code. The gate sighed. The city took that breath it had been building.\n\nBrine does not ask permission of the people who live above it. Brine is a plan you made fifty years ago and forgot to put on the calendar; brine is a debt someone else incurred and your floor pays. It started to move toward the place Jun\u2019s pencil called Sluice Nine. It did not rush like a hero or slide like a thief; it rolled in its own time, wincing around constrictions, humming where the walls were smooth. Orla could feel the difference between concrete poured in 1934 and concrete poured in 2002 because the sound pinged back through the notes like light changing in water. She felt, too, the place where the wall had been patched and the patch had refused to marry the old material. She sent the B-flat there with a little extra friction in it, so the wall would remember the joint was a friendship to renew, not a sullen truce.\n\nA man made of clipboard and authority appeared at the end of the yard, the kind of man who acts like his shoes are better because they are on his feet. He had a mask around his neck he had no intention of wearing, and three other men arranged themselves at his corners so if he moved he would always have a shadow handy. He waved. He didn\u2019t wave to greet; he waved like a cop does in a lane of traffic. Keziah did not see him on purpose. Jun saw him without indicating she had. Orla did not stop singing because stopping is a way to say sorry and she was not sorry.\n\nThe clipboard man announced something toward the room, a sound that would have been sooner and louder in a building with more wall. Orla caught \u201cunauthorized\u201d on a curve and \u201ccease-and\u201d before she bent that vowel into a \u201cplease.\u201d It felt maybe not like power but like correct work. The men who had been pretending not to listen now pretended to be listening to the man because it is hard to stop being polite to things that have uniforms. Keziah flicked her hand and a breaker whispered and the speaker warmed a status light, which was not related to the clipboard man at all and felt better than listening to his paper.\n\nJun folded the map on two lines and handed Orla a look that was a plan. \u201cSluice Nine goes under the civic traffic circle and lets into the old canal cut. The canal cut knows the river. The river knows the sea. Your note knows the latch. If we open Nine, we can steer the first surge where the bones of the city remember boats. We\u2019ll drown a little less.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do we drown instead?\u201d Orla asked, because scars like to be counted.\n\n\u201cThe tourist mall and the men who pretend they built it,\u201d Jun said without heat, then added, softer, \u201cand three streets of small shops, and a church basement I like that smells like old noodles, and a bank that deserves worse. But if we don\u2019t open anything, it\u2019s the schools. It\u2019s the beds in the apartment houses. It\u2019s the pickle plant and everyone who works there. It\u2019s the Library.\u201d\n\nOrla had not been taught to choose who gets wet. She was a plumber; she was taught you fix the pipe. Her throat made a sound that was almost not music and she could feel in the ground Sluice Nine leaning in the way a person leans when someone calls their name across a crowded room. She pictured the church basement, the noodles, the bank with its mouth full of rules, the mall where the girls practiced different lives in the mirror of expensive glass. She thought about how the Library had been sandbagged, its windows defiant. She thought about hands on maps, hands on bolts, hands on her back. She angled the E a fraction and thought of Rowan saying We can make a legal trick look like love and love look like a legal trick, and how angry it had made her at the table, and how true it was now that the world was sloppy with brine.\n\nThe clipboard man spoke louder and closer, as if decibels could do the job that patience usually does. He said there were laws. He said there were protocols. He began a sentence that included the word \u201chysteria\u201d and then stopped not because he had had a revelation about his use of language but because Keziah\u2019s wrench, with a carelessness she lent to it, dropped from the handrail next to him and bit the concrete with a tone that made the bones in every listening person\u2019s ear growl a warning. It wasn\u2019t a threat. It was a tuning note. The clipboard man adjusted his tie and said, \u201cYou will be held responsible,\u201d which sounded almost like an admission of his own helplessness when you scraped the paint off.\n\nOrla didn\u2019t answer. She sang the phrase that had lived under the wrench chorus like a backbone. The bucket arm carried it; the amp broke it into square waves and glued it back together. The world did not reject it. Somewhere under the traffic circle\u2014under the bronzed statue of a man with a heroic elbow and a horse that never learned to be a horse\u2014an old sluice gate remembered how to do what gates do: take orders. It had been kept mostly shut for a hundred and three years by an arrangement of rust and ceremony. The rust had stronger arguments than the ceremony most days. Today the ceremony carried a voice with it that the rust recognized from a time before the registry, before the map, before the city signed and sealed its own forgetting.\n\nSluice Nine opened the way you open your jaw when a doctor says \u201cwider.\u201d It creaked in a language Orla could nearly translate with her tongue against her teeth. It let old water rush through its ribs, and the water wore a new suit. Aboveground, the traffic circle made a noise like someone finding out that their favorite bridge will hold a thousand more cars than posted and deciding to test it. The horses\u2019 ears rang. The heroic elbow pointed west. The brine took the hint and rolled toward the canal cut like a guest who was late for a train.\n\nThe men in the yard swayed as if they were on deck. The clipboard man swore his most clerical swear; it did not change anything about the way gravity had chosen to behave. Keziah laughed because she could see, in the sudden drop in suction, the way the pumps were no longer drinking their own bathwater. Jun sat down, quick, like she had been keeping the city on her shoulders and only remembered that she had knees when Grief took a hand off the load. Orla felt the E settle in her chest into something nearly comfortable. She wanted to vomit and dance, the way you want to after narrowly missing a ladder with your temple and then realizing every step you take forever will be a prayer you don\u2019t have to say aloud.\n\nNews moves like mold on bread when the conditions are right. In the space before the next verse, the registry\u2019s little green light hiccuped and sprayed her name and the name of the song across a thousand screens as if that would protect anyone. A man with a microphone somewhere said her name wrong in an urgent nice tone. A woman with a good haircut mentioned \u201cunauthorized sonic intervention\u201d with admiration the camera did not allow. A boy in a basement ripped the song from the feed and autoloaded it into a mixer he\u2019d pirated from a forum moderated by a person named Milkcap. A girl in a small room hummed the E without knowing why and a spill of tea popped with surprise on a saucer.\n\nThe surge took the canal bed with more dignity than anyone had predicted. The old cut had been sleeping\u2014but not dead, not as long as maps keep their breath\u2014and the banks gave with a sound like open arms. The mall, which had always pretended to be made of leisure and glass, showed how quickly a stage becomes a bathtub. Escalators became waterfalls without needing permission from their board of directors. Shops released scented candles into a world that was too busy to be soothed. A security guard shepherded teenagers onto a bench as if boarding dogs in a storm, counted three heads he was not responsible for and felt responsible anyway, sent a text to a mother whose number he did not know to say These kids are okay. He did not include punctuation because his hands had finally decided to shake.\n\nAt the Library, the sandbags settled in their seams and the glass bowed and held like a good argument. Jun\u2019s boss, who had said \u201cno politics on the desk\u201d for three years and meant it, unlocked the door and stood in the vestibule with a mop like a spear and cried quietly because the maps were safe for this minute. At the pickle plant, the foreman was too busy not drowning to misname anyone, which felt like a miracle and a loss. The boy with the hairnet climbed onto a rack and sang three words of Orla\u2019s chorus because the pipe wanted to shout and who was he to tell it not to.\n\nThe yard breathed again in a different direction. Relief has a noise. So does horror when it glances up and remembers it will be back in a minute. The clipboard man tried again, like a metronome whacking its head against the wrong tempo. He told them to stop; he told them to continue at a reduced volume; he told them they had done enough; he told them they had done too much; he told them he would make a report; he told them he already had. The men around him looked at each other and then at Orla and then at the floor because sometimes respect arrives at the room without an invitation and you don\u2019t know what to do with your face. Keziah unplugged something not useful and plugged something else useful in its place, and when the clipboard man stepped too close, she gave him the smile of someone who has removed her own tooth, alone, and knows where every emergency shutoff valve in a three-mile radius is, and he remembered an appointment.\n\nJun collected her map and rolled it with tender cruelty. \u201cWe can buy time,\u201d she said into Orla\u2019s shoulder as if talking to a carefully tuned harp. \u201cWe can\u2019t buy forgiveness. That will be collected later by whatever survives. We should find Nine and see if it sticks or if it needs a wedge. We should also eat saltines because my hands are shaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could eat a river,\u201d Orla said, which was the sort of joke you do not want to make anymore but couldn\u2019t help making because your mouth has a habit of trying to save your head.\n\n\u201cYou ate a river,\u201d Keziah said lightly, and then made her own joke heavy. \u201cAnd men will say you caused it because you were the weather they saw when they finally paid attention, but they\u2019d be wrong and they\u2019ll say it anyway. Let\u2019s move. The yard will keep. These cranes know their own names.\u201d\n\nThey moved through a city reorganizing itself around them with the authority of water. Streets had edges they had not had in the morning. A man sat on his stoop with his shoes set two steps higher than his feet, saving them as if they were friends too cowardly to wait out the rain and he forgave them. A woman waded with a bundle held high that could have been laundry or a dog or both, singing something that might have been Orla\u2019s E or might have been something older and better. Cars did the thing cars do when they become boats, which is to pretend for a minute and then sink. They cut across a parking lot where lines made sense and then didn\u2019t. They found the traffic circle choked with the raucous litter of modernity\u2014delivery scooters upended like small casualties, an advertisement for whitening teeth torn into a shape that looked like a flag for a country with poor taste and a lot of money. The bronze man and horse had not moved; they never do; they had acquired algae like a borrowed mustache.\n\nThe grate that led to Nine lay under a tide of cigarettes and promises. Jun knelt with that careful contempt librarians save for box cutters. She had a flat pry bar in her bag next to a stapler and a flashlight with a lens so polished it remembered astronomy. Keziah stood watch like a bouncer at the doorway of a club for tired women with better things to do than dance. Orla wanted to apologize to the gate and the brine and the statue and the pigeons and then she realized she would be apologizing until she starved and put her hands into work instead. The grate did not want to come up because of pride, then because of habit, then because a bolt had seized into itself and become creed. Jun loosened the belief with the pry bar. Keziah leaned into the weight with her shoulder like she had leaned into men all her life until they made way because there was nothing else they knew how to do with being pushed by a woman who would not make a scene after she made the scene. The grate sighed. These sounds were the city\u2019s new vocabulary, and Orla was fluent in them whether she liked it or not.\n\nBelow, Sluice Nine was not picturesque. Nine was a jaw with molars. Nine had a hinge that had not been tender to for a century. Nine had a chain like a memory of a necklace. Orla could feel the note it liked before she heard it. She could tell the shape of the rust with the back of her tongue. When she sang again there, the world lost the polite acoustics of the yard and became useful again: tight, rough, responsive. The sound travelled like gossip through a family that has been meeting at the same table since before the oldest aunt can recall her own wedding. Nine creaked further, and the water shouldered through like an aunt with elbows in a grocery store aisle. It bulled toward the cut, which was honoring its old agreements with gravity.\n\nA rusted pin protested in a register Orla felt in her knuckles. Jun swore librarian-swears and located the pin by the map of its sound. Keziah put a wrench on it and then put herself on the wrench until stubbornness recognized a cousin and gave way. The pin slid like a grudge being admitted. The water\u2019s tone changed, dropping from a dangerous adolescent laugh into a risky adult murmur. Jun whistled. Keziah whistled. Orla tried not to cry at the sight of ordinary women making a machine be reasonable. Up above, sirens did their endless circles like badly trained tide.\n\nThey did not get long without men with badges and men with papers. They arrived together, as if some high office had finally dusted its intercom and pressed \u201cALL-CALL.\u201d The badges wanted to control crime; the papers wanted to control narrative; neither wanted to get their shoes wet, but both did. The first man down the steps had a posture like a fencepost and the polite-and-tired look of a person whose daughter had texted him twice a heart and he had written back \u201cbe safe\u201d and meant \u201cI am sorry I wasn\u2019t better earlier when it was easy.\u201d He did not tell them to stop. He asked, \u201cWhat is the goal?\u201d as if he would be seen by his peers asking and that counted as work too. Jun told him numbers. Keziah told him the names of parts. Orla told him a note.\n\nThe men with papers were more excitable. They had phrases ready to be poured into the mold of this moment and they poured them: unauthorized, incitement, crowd control, municipal sabotage, domestic sound-terrorism, precedent. The phrases were sour as if they had been bottled badly. One of them recognized Orla because face-recognition is the sport of men who do not lift anything heavier than a phrase and he said, \u201cYou are the one,\u201d and that made Orla laugh harder than she meant to because none of the ones are one, and she said so in a voice that thinned to wire. He wrote \u201cdenies accountability\u201d in a notebook that would never be read by anyone but him standing in a bathroom making himself feel full.\n\nThe badge with the fencepost spine looked at the canal cut which was doing its best to be a river and then at the women and then at his shoes which were now honestly ruined. \u201cIf you can keep it there,\u201d he said slowly, as if he were tamping down gravel one shovelful at a time, \u201cwe can use the old tide gate as a throat. We can angle the surge into the shipyard basin. The basin is ugly and empty and made of sins instead of people. We can empty the sin for once. But the tide gate needs a song nobody remembers. The controller is in a room with a lock that believes in itself more than almost anything I\u2019ve met.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know its mother,\u201d Jun said. \u201cBring me to the lock.\u201d\n\nThey went, leaving men to guard Nine who would never be thanked for doing it well and would be marched through a debrief if they did it badly. The city\u2019s breath was steady enough to run. Keziah jogged in her boots like a person who has never fallen because confidence has a mass and moves obstacles aside. Jun held the map like a baby, which is to say with the lack of ceremony that can look cold if you do not understand love as maintenance. Orla kept the E in her throat as if the second she dropped it the world would crash to the floor and spill like an armful of dishes.\n\nThe tide gate sat in a building that had wanted to be beautiful and had instead grown useful and then unkind. The lock on its door had the particular prickliness of a thing that had been spared budget cuts by being invisible. Jun crouched and took out two tools that looked like science and a third that was just a hairpin with a grudge. Keziah watched the room. Orla sang under her breath to the keyway and felt the pins inside blink awake as if stared at. Jun did not open it with magic. She opened it with patience and the small amount of luck you get if you bother to carry a hairpin long enough. Inside, the control panel was older than the badge-man had expected and younger than Jun liked. The label on its corner was the name of a man who had been elected twice and then told his mistress to evacuate while his wife loaded the car with soup, and Orla hated that she knew that and hated more that knowing did not help anyone.\n\nThe controller had a port labeled VOX as if it had always known what it wanted in its mouth. Jun glanced at Orla with a look that asked for apology in advance. Orla put her lips near the port like she was going to kiss the thing and instead sang the E she had been nursing as if it were a colicky infant finally ready to burp. The panel lit with a color that meant nothing in the manual and everything in the room, and the code that had been asleep downstairs sent a cousin here that agreed with it, and the tide gate said yes with a frankness that made Orla shut her eyes because those yeses are not free and must be paid for somehow later when no one is still sweaty from saving things.\n\nThey opened the throat of the basin and the brine went there as if it had been the plan all along, sliding greedily around pilings built for men who had stopped believing they would ever build ships again and had hung their hats on the yard like a child hanging a wish on a hook. The basin filled with other people\u2019s errors. The tide outside argued and then accommodated because tides are realists. The pumps in the yard smiled in relief the way a body does at a cough that finally clears the fool film from your lungs. Somewhere blocks away, women put down their buckets and redistributed their blankets and had the kind of laugh that is not joy but is its wise cousin.\n\nAfter, the yard had the woozy look of a room after a fight where nobody knows exactly who got punched, only that everybody did. Men sat on crates and did not talk. The clipboard man had left to be sanctimonious somewhere dry. The fencepost badge called his daughter and left a voicemail in which he did not say everything he meant and said more than he was allowed. Keziah leaned on a pillar and let her head hang forward the way you do when you are trying to talk your spine into being friends again. Jun wrote down the shape of the day on the back of an old flier for a community meeting about \u201cStormwater Management: Our Shared Future,\u201d drawing arrows like tiny admonitions to time. Orla sat on the bucket arm and put her hand behind her own neck and thought about how skin has gears, too.\n\nThe messages on her phone had become a pile she wanted to push off a table into a bag. There were girls with wrenches typed in emoji line-ups; there were men inventing cosmologies in which she was the jealous goddess of their impediments; there were grandmothers telling her their sinks sang to them that morning; there was the boy with the hairnet\u2019s mother, who wrote in a voice too precise to be anything but poor and careful: I do not know your name but you sound like the one who reminds us where we put things down. There was also the Registry, which had moved past Congratulations and landed on Please attend for compliance, and then further to We require in-person clarification, and underneath that the whisper in the code that Jun had found smoking in the stacks: override.gatekeep = false, which looked even more like church in the glow of emergency.\n\n\u201cThey will come for you politely,\u201d Jun said out of nowhere, as if reading text upside down is a thing librarians are born knowing how to do. \u201cThey will smile with their teeth and say that safety is the milk in which we all float. They will say trend spikes are unpredictable. They will say you are dangerous not because you can ruin things but because you can choose not to ruin them, and they did not plan for that when they built the ruin.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a rocket,\u201d Keziah said, half a joke and half not. \u201cWe can leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a city,\u201d Orla said, and it came out more like a promise than she expected and scared her a little because promises have back-edges.\n\nThey did not leave. They ate crackers Jun had stolen from a storage room in the Library where the emergency kits had expired last summer and no one had found the budget to replace them. They drank water that tasted like coins, which at least did not taste like pickles. They stood under a yard light that clicked like tired eyelids coming to attention. Men passed by and did not interfere because sometimes the momentum of their own rudeness leaves them behind if the current is strong enough. Orla\u2019s song played in a hundred kitchens on phones hanging from nails above sinks. The chorus got misremembered in one neighborhood in a way that made it better. A girl in a stairwell between two lives practiced the line about the tool-mouth and found out what her jaw could do.\n\nNight in a city that has just decided to continue is not restful. It is a negotiation you keep having with every surface. Orla dozed and woke and checked the tone in the yard and dozed and dreamed she was a pipe with a name and a birthday and woke to find she was just a woman with a wrench and a mouth and a history, which was both more and less consoling. Keziah kept watch with a posture she denied was duty. Jun wrote a letter she would never be allowed to send, only show to women who came after to lower their blood pressure and raise their courage.\n\nToward the small hour, a truck without markings arrived at the gate, and the men who had been hardened by everything except boredom lifted their heads as if they had smelled an invoice. The truck\u2019s doors opened with the sound of an expensive zipper. Three people climbed out, wearing the same face in different proportions: we are not here to arrest you; we are here to bring you into the process; there is a room with chairs and you can bring a friend. They had on shoes that believe in climate control. One woman among them wore a lanyard like a rosary and smiled in the way of a person who has been promoted for making difficult people feel heard. She looked at Orla, then at Keziah, then at Jun, and chose a tone that would not wake a baby.\n\n\u201cMs. Vale,\u201d she said, getting the name right because someone had briefed her while her car rolled through three neighborhoods full of water. \u201cWhat an extraordinary day. We will need to debrief this both administratively and visionary-wise. There are liabilities and there is an opportunity to ensure the safety story is correctly communicated. We want to give you a platform. We also need to make sure your content pipeline\u201d\u2014she did not hear her own pun\u2014\u201cis aligned with stakeholder parameters.\u201d\n\nJun made a small choking noise that in another room would have been a laugh. Keziah\u2019s shoulder shifted away from the pillar as if it had more to do. Orla put her hands on the bucket arm and felt the machine purr with the residual of a day spent useful. She thought how the lanyard woman\u2019s voice had no brine in it, and how much she trusted voices that smelled like new plastic less than voices that smelled like vinegar and dust. She thought of Rowan drawing a little diagram on his death note and telling her to make it blessed and hating the world and loving her. She wanted to throw a wrench. She wanted to hug someone. She wanted to sleep in a pipe.\n\n\u201cI will come,\u201d she said, mouth quiet, the way you tell a valve to move and it moves because you did not beg it. \u201cBut not tonight. You will give me tomorrow morning and you will not, after I leave, hurt the men who kept Sluice Nine open with their legs and their boredom. You will not take Jun\u2019s maps or pretend they were yours. You will not call Keziah\u2019s cranes assets as if their worth resides in your spreadsheet. You will not say the word hysteria in a room with my name in it again. You will, if you own the mall where we sent the brine, open your doors to the church basement with the noodles. You will also\u201d\u2014she put her hand on the amp, and the amp hummed as if to say I\u2019m listening\u2014\u201cdelete a line of code that should never have been eating its lunch in a government building.\u201d\n\nThe lanyard did not ruffle. She was good at not ruffling. \u201cWe can discuss,\u201d she said, professional as paper. \u201cWe can absolutely calendar a hackathon moment around the legacy stack. We appreciate your passion. Tomorrow morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cTen,\u201d Jun said, because nine sounded like early and sexy and they deserved neither.\n\n\u201cTen-thirty,\u201d Keziah said, because ten would feel like a concession and she was not in the mood to concede in any measurable way.\n\n\u201cTen-fifteen,\u201d the lanyard said, which would have been funny if they had all not been so tired that laughter would have broken something important.\n\nThey left. The truck\u2019s zipper was smug. The yard lifted its shoulders and let them relax like an animal lying down after a long conversation. The pumps ticked in their casings like hearts counting gratitude. Orla sat back and let her spine inform her of its boundaries. Keziah took Orla\u2019s wrist in a hand that could tighten a bolt without thinking and placed her fingers where a pulse happens, and made a face that said, There you are, and then looked away because she respected privacy. Jun leaned her head on Orla\u2019s other shoulder in a way that said, I will be your north again in the morning, but for now we are a weather system.\n\nWhen dawn turned the cranes into spider skeletons against a pale sky, the city smelled less like pickles and more like a kitchen after a party. There is a sweetness to mess when the worst did not happen. Orla answered three messages that mattered and one that didn\u2019t but would have nagged her. She wrote down things she did not want to remember later as if writing them would make them less true. She tucked a thread of hair behind her ear and felt the thin red string Keziah had tied there in the Chamber and made herself not touch it twice like a superstition. She went to the fence and looked east and west and then down because below is always where the story grows. She thought of the registry with its backdoor still ajar and wondered if a city could be taught to keep open a flaw on purpose.\n\nWhen the morning arrived in full and the men restarted their machines and the women checked their buckets and the children, who had not known they were children until they were told to stay out of the way, checked each other for bravery, Orla put her wrench on her shoulder and went to meet the people who say platform when they mean leash. On the way, a girl on a stoop said without greeting, \u201cMy sink doesn\u2019t sulk today,\u201d and Orla said, \u201cGood,\u201d and they both understood this for what it was, a small strong sentence that might hold if you did not ask it to carry too much.\n\nThe municipal building had air that tasted like an old office. It had floors that were not wet. It had a receptionist who looked at Orla the way a person looks at a raincoat with interesting mud and decided not to be surprised. The conference room looked like every conference room and also like the inside of a mollusk and also like a waiting room for pretend. Men in shirts arrived with clipboards and word habits. Women in shirts arrived and put pens into notebooks with stubborn courtesy. The lanyard looked as composed as a well-watered plant. The chair at the head of the table was bigger in some infinitesimal way; it had a back that implied moral structure. A man with hair like a confidence trick filled it.\n\nHe said her name correctly, and then he said his own four times in two sentences because his name had cost him money and he wanted to make sure the room earned it for him. He told her of risk and of rumor and of APIs. He told her the registry was not meant as a pioneering platform. He told her grandfather stories from a city he had not lived in, because men in his chair often collect old tales like lucky coins. He told her that there would need to be a song coordination procedure and that public harm had to be measured in units that could fit onto a graph. He was very reasonable for a long time and Orla listened because listening is a tool as sharp as any and you can shave a sheep with it if the sheep lets you.\n\nWhen he stopped, the room was not open but had the feeling of a lid you could loosen with heat. Jun took a breath that meant a footnote was coming with teeth. Keziah put her palm flat on the table and smiled with no warmth at all. Orla looked at the lanyard woman because at least she had been honest about wanting to calendar things. Then she spoke in a tone she had used to teach a pipe it was time to shut up.\n\n\u201cYou built a gate that asked for old signatures instead of new money,\u201d she said. \u201cYou built that because someone told you the city was supposed to be like a family and you didn\u2019t ask which parts of family are worth carrying forward and which are worth letting die. I sang through it because you will not hire a woman who does not speak like a man, and because my grandfather is dead and I let him be useful one more time and because this place was drowning in vinegar like a joke. I will not pretend I did not use a trick. But you will not call it a trick and turn away from the river I moved.\u201d\n\nThe chair man smiled in a way he believed was reassuring. \u201cWe can harness your enthusiasm. We can embed a vetting layer. We can integrate your talent into a safer design.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to make a room I cannot enter without holding someone\u2019s hand,\u201d Orla said, and laughed because the image was poor and too true. \u201cI will continue to sing. You will remove the line that says I cannot unless a ghost touches my throat. You will train your machines to recognize that safety sounds different from obedience. And we will build a thing that listens to women at the hinge, not only at the ribbon-cutting.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are describing a governance challenge,\u201d he said, Polite in Chief, and Jun made a noise that was very close to a bird of prey.\n\n\u201cShe is describing a city,\u201d Keziah said, leaning in as if to make a deal with the table. \u201cDo not mistake the two because you live in one more than the other.\u201d\n\nThey haggled. The haggling had equations in it, and grudges, and some glitter. Men used words like \u201cpilot\u201d and \u201csprint\u201d and \u201cbeta\u201d as if they were saints; women used words like \u201cdoor\u201d and \u201cdrain\u201d and \u201cday\u201d as if a noun could be a hammer. At the end somebody had changed a policy and somebody had not admitted it. At the end there was paper that could be waved. At the end the lanyard looked lighter and the chair man looked like a man who, if you tipped his head, would run out of adjectives for out-of-scope. At the end Orla felt old and new at once, which was either victory or the way your muscles feel after you carry an awkward thing up a narrow staircase.\n\nOutside, the city reeked and glittered and yelled. The basin held. The canal murmured. Sluice Nine watched like an old cat on a radiator, pretending to be asleep and listening to everything. The rockets, which had in the night been defended by a small army of women who pretended they were only passing by, held their tongues. Jun went to the Library to bully a copier whose drum had decided to produce ghosts. Keziah went to weld a seam on a pump housing and wrote Orla\u2019s name in her head in a way she would deny. Orla went to the Pickling Works because even miracle days have invoices.\n\nThe foreman met her with a damp towel over his shoulder and two names for her, neither of which were hers. He apologized with a ferocity that was either genuine or habit and for once it didn\u2019t matter. He pointed at a sink that had sulked through panic and now refused to be civil. Orla got under it because sometimes your medicine is just doing the job you know how to do and letting the faucet look back at you as if you were the only person who knew where its threads had gone. The pipes there made sounds like the aftertaste of vinegar, and she sweetened them with tape and patience until they swallowed their own bile. The boy with the hairnet applauded once. The foreman said, \u201cYou made the mall into a river,\u201d as if he had just remembered her other job. She asked for double. He paid triple because men, like pumps, sometimes work better if you trick their pride into doing the right thing.\n\nOn the way home, girls had written her chorus in chalk on a wall as if to remind the building it had a mouth. Someone had hung from a window a banner that said in unwieldy spraypaint WE ARE NOT PICKLES and attached three hearts and a wrench. The city had not become polite. It had not become gentle. A man still shoved another man with his shoulder at the light because we are so old, all of us, and we return to our old small violences out of habit. But the gutters sang less brokenly in that moment. The ducts had moods and today they were less sullen. A child was teaching a smaller child to juggle rubber stoppers without dropping any because you can rehearse gravity and still not keep it from laughing.\n\nThat night, when the dark pressed the sky to the shape of the cranes again, Orla sat on her floor and let the tiles cool the backs of her arms. She put the wrench down where she could reach it and did not reach for it. She sang very quietly a new line\u2014something that had come into her mouth at the tide gate and burned a little\u2014about families we are born into and systems we inherit and which ones we are willing to cook down into ghosts and which ones we want to build sidewalks for. She did not record it. She did not send it to anyone. She let it hang above her bed like a leak you are not afraid of because you know where the valve is. Eventually she slept. In the hallway outside, someone\u2019s radio murmured a news voice that had learned the difference between weather and consequences. Somewhere in the basement of the municipal building a programmer got in trouble for a comment he had not left in code and did not understand what for. Somewhere at the edge of the salt flats the cranes settled their steel and pretended they were birds in a story written by a city that had decided, this one time, to listen.",

The gutters still sang but they had relearned a bar of politeness, a rounded vowel at the end of each gurgle, as if the ducts had slept and woken up with better manners. Men on corners argued the way men do when a story has already been told and they\u2019re trying to figure out how to edit themselves into it; each of them had told the brine where to go, apparently, and several had personally authorized Sluice Nine. Women counted towels that would never be the same color again and wrote their names inside rubber boots with permanent marker because institutions will borrow your dignity along with your gear. Orla\u2019s throat felt like she had swallowed a small river stone and it was taking its time deciding whether to stay. When she laughed, which happened twice for real and three times in defense, she tasted Rowan\u2019s salt and some newer sharpness that was not the city\u2019s and not wholly hers.\n\nThe ten-fifteen did not move, which felt like an omen for once in her favor. They put her in a room with walls as smooth as a lie and power outlets at shoulder-height and a bowl of fruit that had been arranged by a man who had never had to save a banana from his children. The lanyard woman smiled with fatigue and skill and introduced a man whose job title had more slashes than bones. They said words that were blunt and slippery in the same breath. There would be a Tone Permitting framework, a Vox Credential issued per decibel class, a Civic Phonetics Council with a subcommittee on Urban Acoustical Ethics, which is to say they would build a gate and paint it a color everyone liked. Jun sat very straight and asked to see the code. Someone said of course. Someone said later. Keziah inspected the ceiling because it is reassuring to have a ceiling to blame. Orla remembered why Rowan hated committees and loved women who kept their own lists.\n\nThat afternoon the backdoor did not so much get removed as pried up and told to stop being coy. Jun used a form she had found that was improperly retired and filed an emergency change request on a holiday weekend that did not exist. The city clerk in charge of refusing such things had a grandmother who sang in a church basement that still smelled like noodles; he signed. A programmer named Dylan with a coffee stain where his courage should have been sat between two monitors and performed a small, modest surgery, supervised in absentia by the invisible pressure of Jun\u2019s eyebrows and the note Orla hummed into his voicemail by accident when she forgot not to sing to machines. The line with the lazy if fell. A second line blinked, a cousin, an older sibling really, buried in an ancient library stack nobody had dusted since the scandal with the sewage bonds. Jun found that one too, and for the first time all week she laughed without sounding like she was filing a complaint with God.\n\nWith the gate no longer a family heirloom, the men invented three new gates and a list of exceptions. The registrar drafted a glossary that made singing sound like a crime. The city posted an advisory asking residents to refrain from \u201cunscheduled tonal manipulations\u201d during peak hours, which was a phrase that lived for one day and died in ridicule. Orla didn\u2019t wait for definitions. She borrowed a school gym that had lost two tiles to the brine and laid out tape in a circle like a ritual she refused to name. She invited the plumbers she liked and the aunties with deep voices and the teenage choir from the church with the noodles, and she told the boys who juggled stoppers they could come if they kept their hands still until she said otherwise. The flyer the city printed for it was branded SOUND INFRASTRUCTURE WORKSHOP and had a graphic of a microphone wearing a hardhat; somebody\u2019s uncle shared it with an eye-roll that made it into a challenge. The room filled with throats and lungs and clocks in sternum bones that had been keeping time for other people too long. Orla tuned them like she would an old manifold: gently, with a wrench she wanted to call patience and could not.\n\nIn the yard, the pumps learned the names of the women who walked past them. Keziah caught a cavitation before it could pockmark a vane and kissed her teeth, the only kissing she allowed herself in public that day. The men up the chain accelerated a test schedule that had been hypothetical since Orla had braids because nothing gets men moving like the chance to make lightning look obedient. They wanted a static fire because the words made them feel like gods in clean shirts. Keziah set her jaw and ticked boxes with the precision of a surgeon who will not remove the wrong organ no matter how many men mispronounce it. Orla climbed the catwalk and felt the motor bearings through the metal with the balls of her feet. She sang to the coupling because it had a headache and the headache was going to cost money. Halfway through the note the platform twitched and someone shouted and she couldn\u2019t see who threw the arm around her waist\u2014the world moved and Keziah\u2019s breath was in her ear and then the platform did not move, because love can be a good hand on your belt and nobody needs to call it love in that second if the word will make anyone clumsy.\n\nThe backlash arrived like a truck backing into a wall\u2014slow, loud, inevitable, late. A man on the radio with the old voice of certainty called her a siphon witch and invited donations. Someone with a magazine subscription wrote a profile with the headline SIREN SYNDROME and spelled her name right with the same energy as spitting. Under a picture of Rowan chromed into a saint without his permission, a columnist wrote sentences that had seventeen commas and no heart. The file from the Library developed a rumor of itself; people called consumption in italics as if italics could keep their own hands clean. The only piece of mail that made her sit down came in a blue envelope and had no return address. Inside was a picture of a girl with a wrench on her shoulder, drawn in crayon, and underneath it in shy unjoined letters: Thank you for getting the water out of my grandma\u2019s kitchen. She put the drawing on the wall above the radio and the news anchor stared daggers at it every night and lost.\n\nThey went to the church basement because the best acoustics in the city are where the ceilings are low and the soup was always meant to be shared. The choir in the room was not a choir the way men define choirs when they\u2019re funding them; it was a group of throats that had learned to hold things. The pastor nodded with the particular pride of someone whose building had chosen not to drown out of respect. The older women sang notes that had vacations and wars in them, that had tomato skins and chain mail and lullabies the singer didn\u2019t like but sang anyway. Orla stood back and counted reasons to cry and sang instead. A girl with a braid almost too tight to breathe asked, at the end, if the tool-mouth line meant you had to be mean to get things to behave. Orla said, only if they mistake being specific for cruelty, and the girl nodded as if she\u2019d suspected that for a while and was relieved to have permission to stop apologizing.\n\nJun\u2019s superiors called a meeting about her conduct that sounded like a request for a recipe and felt like an audit. They had found out about the file only after people in departments that never visited the same restroom argued over who should have access to the word \u201cancestral\u201d in budget requests. The room had two plants and no water and four kinds of fear in it. Jun wore a shirt that took no sides and put her bag on the table as if to remind them she carried things that would outlive their titles. She explained\u2014with the patience of an archivist teaching someone to read a pencil annotation without smearing it\u2014the difference between the records we admit and the records that admit us. A man asked if she had a written policy for choosing when to rescue a city. She said, Yes, but no one has printed it. When they told her she could either be reprimanded or promoted into a role called Strategic Heritage Data she laughed like a paper cut and took the promotion because if you have to lose blood do it where the stains will be visible to the next woman who comes through with a Sharpie.\n\nThe forecast went back to promising comfort in the future tense and delivering damp in the present. A plant upriver burped an apology in the form of a lime spill and the water got teeth you couldn\u2019t see. Orla and the choir of wet things tested a chord that would keep the pH knives from finding the undersides of pipes we needed and the ankles of kids we loved. The aunties held an A-sharp the way they hold a baby\u2019s name and refuse to let it be mispronounced; the teenagers made a harmony that slid like oil without doing harm; the plumbers, bless them, sang ugly and correct and on time. They stood in three basements no one had cared to inventory and moved a problem around the room until it settled into a corner that could bear it. Men would later say there had been no emergency. That is how you know the right women showed up.\n\nBetween storms the rocket yard tried on its destiny like a suit it loved and could not afford. Men in hats came from a dry city to inspect without offering to carry. They asked Keziah if she wanted to be saved from her own competence by a job in a place where the pumps didn\u2019t know her name. They offered benefits that looked like bracelets from across a room. She washed her hands in a sink that spat at her and said she had work here while looking at Orla like deciding not to look was a skill she wasn\u2019t practicing this afternoon. That night, above the basin that was still swallowing other people\u2019s sins, they walked the catwalk without touching elbows. The cranes made a noise like old gods settling their spines and Keziah said, easy, like the city was a dog worth keeping. Orla nearly said stay and did not. She said, If you leave I\u2019ll learn how to fix big pumps without you, which was a love letter written in the dialect of stubbornness. Keziah laughed because she heard it.\n\nBack in the Pickling Works, the foreman\u2019s mouth remembered the shape of Orla\u2019s name and his pride put a hat on to come out in public. He didn\u2019t stop being himself; he just did it with less vinegar. He paid early once and pretended it was because accounting had a new girl. The boy with the hairnet had become a boy with a checklist and he had stopped juggling in rooms that needed eyes. He juggled in the alley where the world could drop things without breaking lives and taught two smaller boys to keep their wrists straight, which is the beginning of knowing you can measure a thing without owning it. Orla fixed a trap that had learned to exhale the wrong way and took off a piece of old pipe that had stories written inside it and told the pipe she was sorry for making it retire. It\u2019s a stupid habit, apologizing to metal. It also keeps you from throwing it in the wrong bin.\n\nThe Listening, as some woman named it on a flyer without telling anybody, happened because they needed to retune the gates before the system forgot how to talk to itself. They met again by the traffic circle, the horse still disbelieving its own bronze, the heroic elbow aiming west at a life no one wanted anymore. A storm had arranged itself along the horizon like a row of old men complaining. The air held its watching stance. Keziah tuned the borrowed amp by clipping its hot lead to a rail that remembered being a riverboat ladder. Jun spread a new map whose back was the seconds page of a mediation from 1961; the paper smelled like decisions that had stayed decided longer than they should. The aunties tested their notes and the teenagers made them sound rude on purpose because respect is sometimes a corridor you refuse to walk in a straight line. Orla stood on the bucket arm, not shaking this time, Rowan at her shoulder in the way a jacket holds a body in weather it understands.\n\nThe first thunderclap was cheap, like a bar trick, nothing to do with their work. The second had a voice in it. She took the E and threaded it into the B-flat like a woman sewing up a pocket her hand had fallen through, and the city said yes again in the mouths of its metal. Sluice Nine hummed and its cousin Seven, which had sulked since 1912, slid one tooth into place for the first time in anyone\u2019s memory. Orla deflected a surge into the basin and another into the canal and a third toward the shipyard\u2019s empty slip where the tide could do the old job it loved. The mall wept candles into a room that needed soap and not light. The church took water at the doorway and turned it back out like a gentle bouncer telling good drinkers to go home. The school that would have had three inches on the first floor had a wet rug instead. This is what victory looks like in a city: a wet rug and a tired chorus and a policeman who lets kids sit on his hood because the ground is cleaner than the car for once.\n\nAfter, no one cheered. They breathed like a train at a station, in and out against a schedule they did not make. The clipboard man sent a text to someone that said \u201cmanageable\u201d as if it were a thing he had baked. The lanyard posted four statements with three fonts that told three different truths, none of them the one about how singing can be a wrench and a blessing and a threat and a municipal service all at once. Keziah leaned her forehead to a post long enough for splinters to consider becoming kin. Jun put the map back in its tube like a priest putting away a vestment. Orla sat down on the bucket arm without grace and held her own wrist the way Keziah had and said aloud, to nobody rude, We can teach the city a chord.\n\nThe city was listening, which is not the same thing as agreeing. It hummed in ducts and under grates and through the tired throat of the news anchor. It hummed in men who had made a profession of driving with their elbows and now found their hands on the wheel, confused, competent, surprised at themselves. It hummed in a girl writing valuations of faucets in chalk on the sidewalk, and in a boy who brought his mother a roll of tape as if he had just discovered she was excellent at all the things that had kept him alive. It hummed in Orla\u2019s ribs like a leak she could live with and fix and live with again. The gutters sang less broken because someone had turned a pin; the pipes had moods and today they were not sulking. That evening, while rain practiced piano on the yard roof and the cranes set their bones for weather, Orla went home and sat on her floor and added a second verse. It was about a door that had been painted shut for so long that people started using the window, and how, if you know what to sing, the paint remembers it was never skin.",

The gutters still practiced their scales on every slight rain; the ducts still woke moody and went to sleep obstinate; the men at corners still pointed at maps on their phones as if pointing told the water where to go. But the racket had acquired something like measure. A woman sweeping a stoop paused to listen to the downspout and nodded to herself in time with the gurgle. A bus driver, normally a flinger of elbows on his own timetable, took his foot off the horn mid-curse and found his mouth humming the E that had sent the surge down the old canal cut. The air on Orla\u2019s tongue had a trace of cucumber only at the edges, as if the city had drunk a glass of water and finally noticed thirst.\n\nPaper learned to find Orla. It came to her door folded official and came in the flower pot handwritten and came under the windshield wiper of her van scrawled with marker that bled at the corners. The lanyard woman\u2019s office had turned into a hive for acronyms; the sound of printers was an insect hum that made the hair on the back of Orla\u2019s neck try to raise. There were outlines of frameworks with boxes named \u201ccommunity input\u201d the size of teaspoons and boxes named \u201crisk mitigation\u201d big as hotel beds. Jun, pocket heavy with upgraded keys and the sort of credentials you don\u2019t show, slipped one of the memos into Orla\u2019s hand and muttered that a Tone Permitting rubric was an apocalypse printed in fonts, then stole it back to scrawl in the margins where to cut it until it would bleed enough to learn manners. Keziah read none of it and all of it by watching men\u2019s shoulders around clipboards, a more reliable metric.\n\nBetween would-be governance and actual gutters, there were other rooms. The clinic\u2019s waiting room chairs had absorbed the shape of ten thousand surrenders and made each new one easier; someone had hung paper cranes made from faded evacuation flyers above the pediatric station because children like birds whether or not the birds like them back. Orla carried a wrench bag because it was the only bag she owned that felt like an honest explanation of herself. The doctor who had told the truth about Rowan\u2019s lungs examined a line of toddlers for coughs that weren\u2019t metaphors and nodded at Orla like a neighbor at the sink. \u201cYou will break the building if you sing that high,\u201d he said, wryness thin as a scalpel, and Orla sang low instead, shaping a note to soothe the vents and the women who had learned twelve ways to sit in chairs without letting themselves fall apart. It wasn\u2019t medicine and it wasn\u2019t not. A baby went from angry to asleep and a mother\u2019s mouth unhooked from the worry it had clenched.\n\nThe day the yard circled a date on a whiteboard in red\u2014the kind of red that makes men feel like they\u2019re getting away with something properly\u2014arrived with sun that felt like a dare. Static fire had always been a phrase like fireworks played through a grant application, but the men who built ardor into checklists had convinced each other and some part of the city and a slice of the sky that it would be responsible. Keziah had known her way around a thrust vector before the mayor knew the difference between a flange and a faucet; she had the gait of a person who had just set down a heavy thing you didn\u2019t even notice she was carrying. She met Orla at the gate with hands that smelled like deionized water and a forecast she didn\u2019t believe. \u201cIt will be too loud for cleverness,\u201d she said, eyes raking the catwalks. \u201cBut cleverness is what men leave out when they make a plan, so we will bring extra.\u201d\n\nSound is air leaning on a wall. Too much leaning and the wall leaves. Keziah had requisitioned the oldest shipping containers in the yard and a field of mesh that had once tried to be a sculptor\u2019s career; she pointed and men in scuffed hats pushed and a grid of metal mouths rose around the flame trench like a chorus of squat companions. Orla tapped the sides with a knuckle and heard each box answer a different vowel. There was a logic to it, a memory of Helmholtz the way a kitchen remembers a recipe after three generations of improvisation. Jun arrived late with a roll of paper taller than she was, the recording of a noise complaint from 1978 that included a diagram of the dock caverns and a paragraph that might as well have said DO NOT WHISTLE IN HERE in a tone that invited exactly that. Together they hung moisture where it mattered most\u2014blankets from the church basement, towels from a locker room, a mesh of wet laundry lines that would turn malevolent wave into weight, give the air something to kneel on.\n\nA man with a badge that said SAFETY and a nervous smile watched them as if they were either reckless or magic. \u201cWe had a consultant,\u201d he said, producing a decision tree that had been printed with blue ink, hoping blue would mean ocean and calm. \u201cWe did not budget for\u2026this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen it is free,\u201d Jun said without looking up, pinning a sheet at an angle that corrected a set of echoes the men had not thought about because echoes are not on most budgets.\n\nOrla flipped through the noises the yard knew: the gossip of cranes, the doldrum hiss of a cooling manifold, the thousand tiny annoyances of bearing steel not quite true. Somewhere below the pumps the brine moved as if remembering the basin had made a promise. She put her ear to the catwalk and it had a temperature, warmer toward the south, colder where the wind found the broken rib of a railing. She adjusted one hanging sheet by inches and felt it catch a tantrum before it began. Keziah grunted approval without wasting a sentence on it.\n\nThey didn\u2019t call it shepherding the men, but someone had to. The yard swarmed like the inside of a hive that had been built out of discipline and debt. The clipboard man had been replaced today by a cousin with a jaw like a lever, who announced \u201cT minus\u201d in a voice that made Orla think of the word minus as a person who politely stole a fork from someone else\u2019s place setting and put it back on his own. Truck horns at the far fence blared in their own attempt to participate; a knot of men had gathered with the sort of signs men make when they love to be punished by their own cleverness. They were not one thing either. Some wanted selfies with noise; some wanted to drown it to prove they could; some had been told to show up and had dutifully borrowed outrage. The horns were a single coarse note at first until the men, being men, competed. Orla listened, found the two that were a half-step apart and crooked as grocery carts, and began to hum between them. One brain at a time the horns fell into a chord, uneasy and not pretty, but not the kind of chaos that makes structures rip.\n\n\u201cIf you turn that into brass,\u201d Keziah said, making a face and then softening it, \u201cI\u2019ll forgive you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI turned them into helpers so they\u2019ll be too proud to stop,\u201d Orla said, and the horns kept on, men finding in their arms something to do that did not require hitting anyone.\n\nThe first cough of flame down the throat of the trench was the kind of sound that tells skin it is a bystander; the second slammed the yard into attention without a speech. Static fire shows you whether a machine knows its own name. Orla should not have been able to hear anything like herself against that shove. She felt, instead, the notes inside the notes, the way a closed mouth still has words in it. Somewhere in the long body of the rocket a turbopump had a stubbornness she recognized. It whined almost, nearly, at a frequency that makes men think God is calling but is only the sound of a blade saying I hate you, I love you, I hate you, I\u2014 She dropped a fourth beneath the E like a gravel bag, and the box to the west of the trench sang back like a barrel in a barn. That detuned the whine to sulk, which was safer than romance.\n\nJun\u2019s pencil ticked across the map even though the map had nothing to do with rockets. She had found that tracing lines in a room where lines were drawn by fire soothed the part of her that needed to explain. \u201cNorth fence is sympathetic to F above middle C,\u201d she said to nobody to prove she still had teeth, and a moment later the north fence rang, confirming she had not made herself up.\n\nThe yard had a roar at the back of it, a sub-bass that made your stomach ask if you had eaten wrong. Orla sent the choir of shipping containers a long slow vowel, adjusted with the heel of her hand on the mic stand like persuading an awkward friend to dance. You could feel noise take a step back, give itself permission to be directional instead of everywhere at once. Keziah checked three vibrating bolts by resting her palm on their brackets in sequence because you can count tight by counting buzz. The static fire hit its scheduled plateau and two of the men who loved a schedule wiped their eyes because tears leaked out of you on their own clock.\n\nMidway, a shudder rolled up the stack that was not in any manual; the scaffolding caught it and sent it back down like an insult. Orla tasted metal that had been told to be patient for eight months and had reached its limit. She changed her mouth shape and the vowel changed place; her jaw went into a corner of the word she would not be able to describe later. The shudder agreed not to become a fight and became an argument. The argument is what structures survive. Jun nodded, breath audible through her teeth, filing for later the moment a line on paper had prevented a line of stress from misbehaving.\n\nIt ended because somebody had written a time on a board and wealth had arranged itself around that time and loved being obeyed. The roar shut its eyes like a man falling asleep at his desk. Air rushed in to fill the space where force had been and tripped over itself. Silence arrived heavy, the kind you set down carefully so it doesn\u2019t bang. The wet hanging laundry lines dripped quietly, happy to have had a job any idiot could understand. The horns at the fence attempted one victory blare and then, finding no enemy, fell into laughter that did a better job of keeping the structure friendly.\n\n\u201cNothing broke that we didn\u2019t already mean to fix,\u201d Keziah said, voice blown ragged at the edges in the way of a woman who has been roaring inside her head for an hour and would prefer to be quiet in her bones now. She did not look at Orla with any expression a man would have recognized as gratitude because that made it easier to stand upright.\n\nThe news did what news does. It attached cameras to smiles and arranged sentences into ladders the wrong people climbed. A man who had never been inside an engine pronounced the whole thing a miracle of public-private partnership, as if the city were two parenthesis and he were the dash they held up. A woman with hair that did not change in weather tried to ask Orla what the ethical framework was for interfering with a planned acoustic environment, and Orla answered by naming three wrenches and one choir, and the editor found a way to make that not air. A boy sent the audio of the shipping containers to his grandmother, who said without charity that men had built bigger boxes for smaller reasons.\n\nAfter the static there was an elastic, slack time where people tried to see if the world would retract to its previous size. It didn\u2019t. In the drag of that, the file from the Library lit up like an unguarded stove. The city had discovered the rumor of what Orla had done in the Chamber and, as cities do, had shaved it into news and dressed it in costumes. Headlines married appetite to inheritance and then put them on trial. Some people wanted to call her a saint of pipes and some wanted to call her a cannibal of legacy and some wanted to call her on the phone and ironically they had better words than that. It is hard to let private things be private when they are public infrastructure. Orla refused interviews that wanted the recipe and accepted conversations from women who needed to know how to make a door that would open for all the girls behind them and not slam shut on their own hand.\n\nJun did what Jun does: she wrote down the problem until it had to be honest and then she found legal paper that didn\u2019t ask permission to exist. She drafted a license on Library time that began, Songs as Infrastructure: A Civic Commons, and under it put sentences so plain the men kept looking for the trick. The license said you could not own a voice that turned the water from harm to not, even if you attached it to a platform and a lanyard and five subcommittees. It said downloads were for survival and also joy. It said if you built a gate you had to count how many people liked it, not how many people you kept out. It said nothing about ghosts, because Jun knew that if you write a door in law for a ghost the wrong men walk through it and sell the hinges. The clerk with the grandmother in the noodle church stamped it and went home on a bus that hummed under him and told his cousin everything.\n\nOrla did not write a song about the Chamber and her mouth and the smallest part because there are things you do not turn into rhyme and sell back to yourself. She wrote a verse about inheritance that called it soup and not blood and put into it a line Rowan would have hated and loved: we cooked our dead into instructions the way you cook a bone until it lets go. She put that line in her pocket and did not sing it yet. She did not need to; the pipes hummed that sentiment in a crude way when they remembered who they were carrying for, and the aunties corrected them at the end of each phrase.\n\nWhile the city argued itself into enlightenment and then out again on the hour, water continued to behave as always. A facility upriver spat a breath of something not labeled properly and the water licked its teeth. Keziah found a little pitting on a vane and kissed her teeth and Orla made the choir hold a discord long enough to convince a pump that cavitation was a life choice it could skip. The Listening that had felt like an experiment turned regular the way a dinner that happens twice in a row turns into a tradition if you have the nerve to call it one. Sluice Seven got jealous in a way only a gate can and they cajoled it with a note it remembered from 1912 when a woman whose name never made it into any book had tapped it with a ladle during a breach and told it to behave because she had six kids and five pots and no room for this.\n\nThe registry kept trying to mitt Orla into safe lanes. It suggested collaboration with a brand. It offered to put her face on a poster with a child wearing noise-cancelers and a tagline about decibels and duty. It pitched a line of licensed wrenches that would spark joy without sparking anything dangerous. When she did not answer, the registry sent the lanyard with a smile that was a better fence than any; it asked again to be allowed to put her in front of a board that had discovered it could be generous at scale with other people\u2019s gusts. Orla said she would stand in front of any board that would sit in front of Sluice Nine for three hours and write down what it learned about patience. There were no takers and there were three shocked sighs, which felt like a good day\u2019s tally.\n\nMercy in a city arrives in sneaky places. A laundromat on Ninth whose owner had been fined twice for refusing to install a television and once for cooking beans in the back let the Listening dry their damp hanging baffles for free and made every child leave with two mismatched socks on purpose like a game to remind them they had been somewhere they were part of the machinery. The Pickling Works, having considered its sharpness and found it wanting, went back to its old recipes for a week and the men pretended not to notice and then sighed like a crowd remembering their first honest meal in a season. The church basement\u2019s noodles tasted more like soup and less like damp cardboard, and the pastor had the nerve to ask Orla to fix a toilet afterward because the Lord does not despise small labor and because salvation is passive voice for help me carry this bucket.\n\nThe men who had organized their horns into a chord showed up at the yard with a sheepish box of donuts and wanted very much to talk about engines. One of them, whose watch remembered better times, said without a joke that he was tired of being a person who only learned to push and wanted to learn to pull. Keziah handed him a length of line and pointed at a chain that had been sulking under its own rust; he pulled until it moved and made a face like a man experiencing opinion where muscle had been, and laughed in a way that suggested he might bring lunch next time on purpose.\n\nOn the second Tuesday after the static fire, a rumor exactly the size of a window slithered into the yard with the same energy. The men with dry shoes had found money to write a date for a launch the way you write a name in icing on a cake, not because the cake needs sweet to be cake but because it looks good in photographs. The basin was behaving like a friend who had finally learned to say no to late-night calls and might not always pick up. The brine had subsided to a level that made the clipboard men stand taller and the aunties cock their heads. A day with less water is a day when men forget to be grateful and start deciding again without asking, and you could feel that arrogance slide back into the room like a shadow under a door.\n\nOrla could have said no to being at the yard that day, but saying no to noises she wanted to shape felt like letting someone else tune a pipe with a hammer. She said yes to Keziah with her eyes. Jun pretended to be needed by three committees at once and in the gaps brought them a bag of bolts and a list of ward captains who had called to say that if anyone suggested a celebratory horn parade they would throw shoes.\n\nThe morning of the window smelled like cardboard and concentrate. Men ran their hands down their shirts twice before a camera saw them; women tucked two extra bandanas into back pockets like talismans. Over the basin the air looked normal, which is to say treacherous and probable. The crowd by the fence did not gather like a mob but like neighbors whose leases had been rewritten without them and were curious who had signed their names. The lanyard woman stood under a new hard hat that had a sticker on it with a logo adjusted to match the color of the sky. The badge with the fencepost spine had once again become the person whose yes would be carved in blame if things became no.\n\nKeziah\u2019s hands were steady and therefore her voice could afford trembling. \u201cEveryone who matters is here,\u201d she said toward the rail and maybe toward Orla, then to the pumps in a tone she used for bolts that would strip if you used the wrong wrench. \u201cDo your jobs. Do not show off. I am very tired.\u201d\n\nThe first flame was theatre, the second a statement. The machine bit down into the bolts it had chosen; the air lifted its elbows; the water in the basin clenched and then kept being water. For a minute, the roar settled into a steady insistence and each person in the yard remembered a different person they loved, which is what big noise does; it wipes the slate and puts a picture back in a corner out of nowhere. Orla sang and was mostly singing to the inside of her own head, but things inside her head had learned how to go places.\n\nThe tremor came different than static. It wasn\u2019t upward; it wasn\u2019t down. It was a side to side like a child\u2019s first wrong step, a hint of pogo nobody had scheduled because the math for that had been done, signed, filed. Men who trusted math looked around as if to find the person they could accuse of rounding. Keziah\u2019s jaw made a list. Jun\u2019s pencil snapped and she took it as a sign to use her voice and called, A-sharp, blunt, and Orla grinned because the aunties had named that note stubborn and the names were the same thing today. She sent the A-sharp and felt it take a bite out of the tremor like a good dog at a bad ankle. The containers were not enough; she saw the odd bounce on a midspan brace and hated the engineer who had chosen cost over calm and sent him forgiveness in a chord, because you have to forgive the dead who built the living you hate, or live bitter in a room full of pipes you will never listen to right.\n\nSomeone at the fence shouted come down because they thought she would be safer closer to the ground, and Orla thought for a cold second of falling, and then thought, Safety is such a liar when it is trying to hide control, and stayed where her mouth could aim. The tremor tried to climb anyway the way ivy does when you swear you cut it to nothing. She found the space in the back of her throat where Rowan had kept the sound he used to scold a leaking trap without waking the house, and she put the house to sleep with it. There is a note you can sing that is not music and is still mercy; it tells metal you remember what it wants to be on a day when everyone asks it to be other. The pogo wavered. The basin did its ancient job again with the patience of geology. The machine remembered to be muscle and not mouth.\n\nIf the city cheered, it did it in private between girders. In public, it took off its hat and put it on and took it off again and pretended it was not crying at its own wrist. The men whose horns had joined the chord last time made no sound. The lanyard woman put a line through a word on a page no one would see and wrote the same word again in a letter two days later and called it leadership. A child by the fence, scolded for not covering ears, covered eyes instead and bragged later to a cousin that it had been louder that way, which was true enough to keep.\n\nAfter, under the shadow of a crane that thought it was a bird when it was very tired, Orla leaned against hot steel and said to nobody she could name, \u201cI cannot be the hinge forever,\u201d and Keziah, who had not been listening because she had been relighting the furnace of her own heart, said, \u201cGood, because I like doors but I love walls that hold.\u201d Jun arrived with a thermos of coffee that tasted like ocean and blame and set it between them. They drank without letting their mouths touch the lid because certain intimacies are for other days and because the yard had eyes. A man walked by and didn\u2019t say thank you and for once it did not take anything from the room to let him keep his silence.\n\nIn the week that followed, the city found its appetite for ordinary again. It argued about parking and our lady of the basilica\u2019s new paint and whether the market should allow a pop-up selling kombucha pronounced wrong. It put bubble wrap around the places where the brine had made edges and let kids pop the bubbles without telling them what they represented. It made the aunties saints in two neighborhoods where men did not usually admit sainthood came with a haircut and a grocery list. The Registry issued a press release that sounded like a marriage proposal written by a committee and addressed to a person who had already eloped. Orla fixed a skittish check valve in an old walk-up and a boy showed her a frog he had rescued from a puddle that was too sharp and she bit her mouth because it was a decent thing to do and because there is never enough decency but sometimes there is exactly one frog at the right time.\n\nThe other rumor on the wind wore different shoes. You could hear it in the courthouse corridor where men with memory loss in their eyes looked at women carrying copies of records like knives. You could hear it in the supply room at the yard where someone wrote on a white board in dry erase paint that was never meant to erase DECIBEL CREDIT BANK and then changed the subject when Keziah walked in. You could hear it in the Library stacks where Jun found a budget draft that suggested the Listening be brought indoors under the auspices of Men With Permission and moved to Thursdays. There is always a rumor that wants to turn songs into permits. Jun rolled the draft into a tube and slid it under the leg of a table that wobbled and called that governance, and laughed alone, the brittle laughter of someone who has managed to be promoted into a position where she can be fired publicly for being right.\n\nAt night in Orla\u2019s apartment the pipes had begun to speak with an authority that was not Rowan\u2019s. His voice was in there, kind as an old screw head that had seen the right screwdriver; his laugh made the elbow in the bathroom never complain even when the building shivered. But something else had moved into the throat of the walls, something older than the registry and younger than the bricks. It came like a bassline through the hot water riser, steady, curious, not asking permission to exist. It asked her for nothing but attention and delivered nothing but request. She found that if she put her bare feet on the tile and her head against the plaster where the pipe elbowed through, she could hear it almost speak. The city, if you want to name it, had decided to use her for a mouth for one thing only: its need to be called by a name she had not thought to ask it for.\n\nShe outlasted the urge to hold a ceremony for that. There are so many ceremonies waiting for women who have done anything even slightly strange; you can lose your entire life to them and die without ever doing the work again. She sat with her back against the wall and thought about the first time she had held a chase nipple in her small hand and felt the joy of a piece of metal that knew its job. She thought about the day the men invented a word that did not exist\u2014picklecatastrophe\u2014and how quickly it had become a tool they shook at each other when they forgot what problem they had actually made. She thought about Keziah\u2019s hand finding her waist without asking for permission in a moment when permission was noise, not safety, and finding that she had saved herself an answer by not falling. She thought about Jun\u2019s laugh in bureaucrat rooms and how it had become a fulcrum.\n\nWhen sleep came, it brought Rowan and something else, a river mouth with a voice like sand and a laugh like a bell in a fog. The dream had the taste of metal, which meant her body had decided to be honest. The river mouth said, without moving, You are not the hinge, girl, you are a bolt. Bolts are not heroes, and bolts are not poets, but the world falls apart at the failure of the humble, and heroes and poets alike go through. She woke up angry for half a second at the demotion and then hungry in the way a person is when called to labor instead of applause. On the radio, the anchor had learned to distinguish between weather and consequences and had begun, cautiously, to tell the difference in his sentences.\n\nAt the Listening that Thursday, which no committee could reschedule no matter how they moved the boxes on their forms, the aunties sang the A-sharp with the swagger of women who had saved a school from a wet rug and knew it. The teenagers added a blue note they had no right to and everyone forgave them because the world would always need something rude to pull it forward. Orla taught a new line about a door that had been painted shut and how paint remembers being sky if you unteach it. The pipes obeyed, which is to say they argued in an orderly fashion and then did. In the back, a girl with a wrench on her shoulder drawn in crayon on her shirt elbowed a boy who had learned to juggle without dropping anything and said, It sounds like our house, and he said, It is our house, in a tone that sounded like a promise pretending to be a simple fact so it could live.\n\nThe launch window narrowed then widened then narrowed because men negotiate with sky like they negotiate with each other, repeating their names until one of them sticks to a wall. The basin held with dignity and demanded its due. The registry discovered, to its dismay and secret delight, that a commons license is cheaper than a war. The lanyard woman adjusted to the idea of being the person who got the right things wrong in public and wore her new mistakes with a competence that finally let her take off her smile. The clipboard men evolved into safety men into operations men into men who did not need to be told twice which direction the brine will prefer; evolution is expensive when you have shoes you love.\n\nOn the morning the window narrowed enough to truth and everybody knew it without being told, Jun appeared in Orla\u2019s doorway with a bag of bolts, a map, an apple, and a look that said something had been waiting in a stack too long and had finally stretched its legs. \u201cThey will do it today,\u201d she said, and her face did not decide whether to be hope or the other thing. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a speech. This isn\u2019t a fight. This is a ride. He would have hated it,\u201d and Rowan\u2019s name did not have to be spoken because the pipe down the hall made a sympathetic sound like a saint being reminded of a sin they had chosen on purpose.\n\n\u201cThen we will sing,\u201d Orla said, and Keziah\u2019s knock on the door meant they didn\u2019t have time to sit with the brutal plainness of that and they would carry it with them anyway like a wrench you don\u2019t use but need because your hand is used to its weight. The yard had eyes like a person waiting for a diagnosis. The basin had been combed in a deliberate way that made men feel they had asked gravity to sign permission slips. The horns at the fence were quiet, their men having learned from the last time that sometimes participating is pointing and sometimes it is not doing that.\n\nIf the city had a name other than the one on maps it did not say it. If the city had a song other than the ones we give it daily by living in it, it did not sing it. It hummed though, a hum in ducts and ribs and old wood and the seam where carpet meets tile. Orla stood where her mouth did a job bolts cannot and let herself carry all the ordinary heavy little things she would carry in any case because glamour is a liar and work is also a liar and together they make something close enough to honest to hold while the sky tests the math and the man at the microphone remembers to say the number only once.\n\nThe flame came and the noise made an altar of the ground and the brine told a joke in a low voice and kept going west and east with equanimity. The rocket did what rockets do when they have been listened to enough: it stayed, then moved, then stayed, then did not fail. Orla sang, which meant sometimes she spoke under the roar and sometimes she did not and sometimes she made a face and the city read it and translated. Keziah watched bolts that were her friends and welded her hands to the air with worry. Jun wrote one line on the back of a receipt that would be studied later by women who were tired of reading only men with badges, and the line was not poetry and not law but was the thing both pretend to be: Open on the note you can live with after.\n\nThey opened on that note. The rest of it\u2014what happens when a city decides to pronounce its own name in front of the sky, what happens when men hear it and want credit, what happens when a woman\u2019s mouth becomes a tool and no one can take it out of her hand\u2014was the story that would have to be told another day, in another room, with all the chairs moved against the wall to make space for dancing that did not ask permission because it had done the work and brought the towels.",

The gutters had picked up a trick from the aunties and released their syllables cleanly at the end of phrases. Ducts were still moody, but more like teenagers who hear themselves and blush when they catch their own reflection arguing with the world. Men on stoops debated the exact minute the basin had saved the launch as if they\u2019d been standing with their hands in the valves, and the arguments had softened in places the way rope softens when it has done enough pulling to learn it is, in fact, not alone. Orla moved through it with the attention of someone who had spent too much time under sinks and now knew rooms by their breath, and her own throat had the feeling you get after shouting at the ocean: not hurt, exactly, but lined with a memory of power that makes quiet feel like a decision rather than a lack.\n\nMen inside the municipal building had summoned a meeting to discuss the Decibel Credit Bank, and the phrase came back to the street with the smell of printer toner and the livid sheen of an obvious mistake. You could tell who had liked the phrase by who repeated it with all its capital letters and who wrote it small so it could be erased by laughter. Jun brought home a copy with a coffee stain she hadn\u2019t made and drew lines through boxes until the paper looked like a map of a city that refused to turn its streets into toll roads. Keziah flicked a crumb off a box of bolts in the yard and said aloud to the air, \u201cNo bank can hold that note,\u201d and she meant both the money and the sound. The Listening kept on as if no one had tried to coin it into tokens, and in rooms that smelled like noodles and bleach the notes fell where they needed to and lifted where they were asked, the way a decent neighbor does with a couch on moving day.\n\nPhone calls began to arrive from places where the river did not have an address but did have memory. A woman with a voice like gravel and a laugh like a slipway called from two towns upriver and said their intake screens had begun to cough and they could tell the brine was creeping up to see how the other half lived. She had no patience for the men at her council who liked minutes more than water; she had been told Jun\u2019s name by a baker and Keziah\u2019s by a man who sold rebar and Orla\u2019s by a child who had seen chalk on a wall and decided it was a sort of weather report. The upstream weir, she said, had stopped behaving like a wall and started behaving like a sulk. Its operator had a badge and a shrug. The farmers had already moved their tractors to the highest ground that could still be called ground. She asked, without ceremony and without apology, if the women who had made the city hum might teach the river to remember upstream.\n\nThey took the van with the defaced mermaid because heroes and saints don\u2019t have better transportation and because the van knew the route to water like a dog finds its way to a lake from a car window. Keziah tuned the engine by ear as they climbed out of the city\u2019s orchestral bowl and into a ribbon of road that remembered being a path with a horse on it. Jun secured three rolled maps with a belt and told them, in the tone of a librarian telling a ghost where to sit, that the River Compact men would be there with new hats and old authority. Orla put her hand on the dash the way she put her hand on a pipe and listened to the van\u2019s complaint and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll stop for coffee where the sign says pie and the pie has a first name,\u201d because travel requires treaties even with your own expectations.\n\nUpriver, the air was less city and more tin roof. The sound underfoot was different too, a long vowel of earth that had not been compressed under brick and had none of the city\u2019s proud consonants. The town had a bakery that smelled like the sort of bread you remember when you cannot remember anything else, and in front of it men leaned the way men leaned in any town that had not yet decided whether its river was friend or boss. The weir sat like a molar the town had never forgiven itself for needing. Its concrete was from a decade when concrete believed in itself more than the people who ordered it did. The operator in his box had the posture of a man whose job never made the news and whose marriage depended on not forgetting which box on the form meant to call before taking action.\n\n\u201cGarrison Weir,\u201d Jun read off the old brass plate with the indulgence of someone correcting a book that had printed the wrong name. She had already learned the gossip of the hinges from the map: built after a flood, argued over by cousins who stopped being cousins, reauthorized like a lie that had become a habit. Keziah put her hand to one of the exposed bolts and hissed between her teeth at the way its threads complained. Orla put her ear to the sheath of pipe that ran from the gatehouse to the river like a nerve and heard a hum that was not only water. There was a tone to the metal itself that said it had been made by a factory with men who were bored in the winter and got into trouble in the spring, and it made a different sort of complaint than the city\u2019s old iron did, less poetic and more literal minded, as if it were a man who wanted instructions and not a story.\n\nThe River Compact men had faces borrowed from other rooms where men wore hats and told time out loud. They had a young woman with them who had a binder and a haircut that left her neck exposed like a dare, and she smiled at the women the way a person smiles across a drawbridge that is going to hold neither of them for the whole conversation. \u201cWe\u2019d like to avoid any unauthorized acoustic intervention,\u201d one of the men read, as if he had just learned all three words and wanted to exercise them. The binder woman said, almost under her breath, \u201cWe\u2019d like to avoid salting a county,\u201d and Orla liked her at once for knowing how to put two things in a sentence and let them lean on each other without either falling.\n\nFarmers arrived in their own language: boots with rivers written up the sides, faces like weather maps, hands that knew more about patience than any door could teach you. An auntie in a clean skirt stepped out from behind a pile of pallets and stood as if she had been waiting her whole life to speak to a woman who would listen. She sang four syllables in a tune that woke up meadowlarks and the weir operator put his cigarette out not because of the rule but because his grandfather had taught him to listen when that song took the air. Orla answered without taking the lead. She shook the binder woman\u2019s hand and asked for the service manual to the gate. The operator looked offended and then relieved that someone wanted it. Keziah took it and flipped to the parts diagrams like a priest finding a psalm that hurts less to sing.\n\nUnlike Sluice Nine, Garrison had pride. It thought its job was to say no until a clock said yes. It had a gear that wanted oil it had not smelled in a year, and a latch that would not latch for anyone who pronounced its name wrong. Orla could feel the brine behind it like a rumor in a classroom, leaning in, waiting to see if the substitute teacher would enforce the rules. The choice was the same as at the traffic circle and also not the same. Upstream, there were fields that used the river\u2019s kindness as calendar and charm. Opening here to push the brine back toward the basin would save intakes and hurt acres where corn made decisions about a family\u2019s winter. Closing here to save rows would let the city drink trouble a week later with sugar in it to hide the taste. There was no version where nobody got wet.\n\n\u201cI am not your hinge,\u201d Orla said, not to the men and not to the aunties, but to the weir with its teeth. \u201cI will show you the note, and the note will show you the rest.\u201d She backed away from the place on the rail where a person stands when she wants to be seen. She put the binder on the hood of a truck and held it open with a wrench. Jun took three pins from her hair and drew a diagram in the dust that matched the one on paper but included a circle labeled \u201cWomen,\u201d and it was not an appeal, it was a fact. Keziah looped a rope over a bollard like a sentence you could finish two ways and handed the other end to a farmer with a shoulder you could put an order on.\n\nThey did not have the aunties from the church basement but they had this county\u2019s aunties, and their notes tasted like pie filling and anger and girls\u2019 names whose donors had expected sons. Teenagers who had been pretending they did not like anything found they liked this, the way your face looks when your mouth holds a sound that will change a piece of metal. The men with the hats put hands to their belts and decided to be useful because a room full of women with purpose makes a hat heavy. The operator opened his window and said, after a silence that felt like a big dog sniffing your hand, \u201cShe likes B. Don\u2019t ask me why. We\u2019ve tried.\u201d Jun nodded as if she had finally been given the last ingredient to a stew she already knew how to make.\n\nIt was not complicated and it was not simple. The aunties took a B and made it true. The teenagers pressed it with harmony until the weir\u2019s pride turned it into obedience without quite feeling insulted. Orla put an E underneath when the rigging needed something to lean on and did not let herself be a leader so much as a level, correcting a tilt with her hands before anyone saw it. Keziah watched the rope with a gaze that softened into relief at the ways a knot can take opinion and hold it still without cruelty. The brine crept and then backed, not because it had been told to by law but because water listens when you make it an honest request. A field down the road took a drink it hadn\u2019t asked for and survived it because three farmers had foreseen the resentment of the day and carved a furrow with their stubbornness.\n\nOn the other side of the county, another weir without a plaque moved because someone Orla would never meet had taught another set of aunties to hear its latch. Downstream, the basin loosened into its less dramatic work, chewing other people\u2019s sins with the steady jaws of a kind animal. The Decibel Credit Bank needed a single song to meter and found instead a county full of women adjudicating against drought, and its software\u2019s patience went out for cigarettes and did not return. Jun\u2019s eyebrows rose half an inch when the error page loaded and she took a picture to show to the lanyard woman later, not to gloat but to document the moment a gate forgot its job and a commons remembered it.\n\nAfter, the River Compact men wanted a photograph. They wanted to hold the rope in the photo, not because they had pulled it but because they had learned enough to know standing near work made a body less foolish. The binder woman did not smile in the picture and that made it better. The operator of the weir leaned out of his window and tapped the side of his box and said, \u201cShe likes B,\u201d and the teenagers cheered him as if he\u2019d delivered a baby. The aunties arranged to meet next Thursday because people like to name a thing a tradition as soon as it\u2019s happened twice. Orla did not look for a camera. She took the wrench off the manual and closed it and looked at the farmer whose crops had gotten a little too mouthy and said, \u201cTell me what the drain does behind your barn,\u201d because ask a better question and you\u2019ll get a better plan.\n\nOn the way back, the van felt lighter. Not in the way of magic, but in the way of a basket that holds three apples instead of two because someone finally stopped pretending the third apple was too heavy. They did not stop for pie because they had eaten other kinds of sweetness and that was enough, and also because the bakery was closed with a sign that said GONE TO THE WEIR in handwriting that assured the reader the pie would be better tomorrow because the cook had a story to tell it. Jun looked at Orla over the map tube and said, \u201cThey will come to take what we made and put it in a binder,\u201d and Orla said, \u201cThen we will teach the binders to sing,\u201d and Keziah laughed so hard she had to pull the van over and put her head on the wheel, which startled a flock of birds in a field and made them turn into punctuation in the sky.\n\nThe city was not offended to see them again. Cities don\u2019t get offended so much as they change the subject when you think you\u2019re the one making it. The basin had the contentment of a neighbor whose living room had hosted a meeting where the right people finally asked the right questions. The horns at the fence had fallen into a habit of not needing to prove themselves on days without a plan. The lanyard sent a message that contained the phrase \u201cpilot project\u201d three times and \u201ccommunity protocol\u201d once, which is how you know someone learned something they will make into an acronym later. Jun went to a meeting knowing she would need to be gentle until the last five minutes and then unkind in a way that saves more time than it costs. Keziah went to tighten a bolt that had been tight yesterday and learned that relief loosens metal just as fear does, which is why nothing stays done without being loved again.\n\nAt home, the pipes had a dampness in their tone that meant the weather had a new hobby. A child on the third floor had discovered she could make the stairwell sing if she ran her hand on the rail in time to the rhythm of her feet, and that song ran down into Orla\u2019s ear with the confidence of a city that has started writing its own instructions on the walls it owns. In the van\u2019s side panel, the mermaid\u2019s devil tail caught the late sun and turned it into a wink. Someone had written under the chalk We Are Not Pickles a smaller chalk line that said We Are Bolts, with a heart on one side and a wrench on the other, and a girl stood nearby eating an ice pop as if she had always expected to see such a sentence and was happy to know she\u2019d been right.\n\nThe rockets held their station on the horizon like stubborn punctuation. When they finally left properly, it was early morning and nobody had been promised joy so it came clean. Men cried in private and later claimed the wind had got them. Women wiped hands on aprons and called neighbors to the stoop and let it be what it was without asking it to be more. The yard was still and then not. The long mouth of the machine opened and spoke fire, and the basin did its job without applause. Orla did not sing at it as if it were a dog; she sang at her own body so it would hold still where it needed to and flex where it must. Keziah said nothing to the bolts and thought everything a person can think at metal without disturbing its work. Jun watched the faces of the men who had become better men and the faces of the men who had found this made no difference to them and made a note that would hurt later and be needed sooner.\n\nLaunch did not end anything. It made a new kind of noise in town for a while and then faded into the kind of pride that turns into chores. After, more paper came. After, the Registry tried to sell commemorative wrenches and discovered the commons license had teeth in it and those teeth were currently busy eating graft. After, a boy moved his grandmother\u2019s piano three inches away from the wall and found the note the apartment needed to stop damp crawling up the plaster. After, a woman at the Pickling Works started to whistle while she worked for the first time in a year and the foreman did not tell her to stop because every time he opened his mouth to be wrong he remembered a sink and shut it.\n\nThere were things the story did not do for them. Rowan did not come back and say you did good; he floated where the pipes forget and the river remembers and visited Orla only in work and in the shiver before a gate opens. The Decibel Bank did not dissolve; it became a committee with a different name and better biscuits. The Compact men did not stay humble; they found new hats. But the bridge between upstream and down had become a regular path, not a pilgrimage, and women could now walk across it without asking for a pass.\n\nThat evening, when the long day had taken off its shoes, Orla stood with Keziah at the edge of the salt flats where the cranes turned black against a lemon sky. The city\u2019s breath had slowed. The ocean lay where it always lay, which is to say as close as it could get without starting a fight. They did not touch. They had learned that not touching was a kind of touch when the world was loud and you wanted to keep one thing that was yours silent and true. Keziah scuffed a heel in the crust and said, \u201cThey asked me again to go,\u201d meaning the dry city with its salaries and its labs with carpet that never knew salt. Orla watched a gull invent a new insulting angle and said, \u201cThey always will. You are the thing they cannot make a machine for.\u201d The space between them carried more words than their mouths would risk.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Keziah said, and let the words be simple, which made them costly and worth paying for. \u201cNot while this place remembers my name. Later, maybe, when it is rude to stay.\u201d She looked at the horizon as if hoping to catch a misstep and punish it kindly. \u201cYou?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a bolt,\u201d Orla said, and could feel the river\u2019s laugh in her teeth and Rowan\u2019s old hand in the way her shoulder let itself settle. \u201cI don\u2019t leave. I hold. Or I teach other bolts, and then I hold less, and that will be the best day I have.\u201d\n\nJun arrived in the half-light with a stack of forms held together by an elastic that would break when it would cause the most hilarity and the least harm. She had a ribbon threaded through the top sheet like a joke and it read LICENSE: Commons, Tone As Infrastructure. The city had signed itself, awkward and grand, as if writing its own name for the first time. \u201cThey\u2019re going to pretend they invented it,\u201d she said, pleased and tired and mean in the way that saves people, \u201cso we let them, and we keep the real thing here where the pipes can read it when they forget.\u201d She put the forms on the hood of the van and the mermaid accepted them as if she knew legal paper when she saw it and liked it better with grease spots.\n\nThey ate stale cookies left over from a safety training and called it dessert because sometimes a treat is nothing more than a mundane thing eaten with people who know what you mean when you call yourself a bolt. Behind them the city cleared its throat and went on. In a tenement two neighborhoods over, a couple argued about a frying pan and then sang under their breath at the same moment and decided they were ridiculous and not dangerous and laughed themselves into bed. In the Library, a flood plan from 1938 spoke in pencil to a flood plan from last week and agreed to be wrong together in a way that might make them right enough. At the basin, the water slapped its own edges and pretended it was not proud of what it had held.\n\nOrla went home and lay on her floor and let the tile do that thing tile does when the day has cooked you. She sang one line softly that had been waiting under her tongue since Garrison had shown its teeth. It was about how the door stops being painted shut if you bother to unstick the hinge and then don\u2019t make a ceremony of walking through it. It was about how women are never the hinge only to other people and always the bolt to themselves if they\u2019re wise, and how wisdom is a habit of hand. She did not write it down. She put it on the top shelf of her memory where the dust doesn\u2019t settle because the house keeps moving and the air keeps its promise to carry.\n\nIn the morning the gutters asked for scales and got them. In the afternoon a boy showed Orla a frog he had learned to carry without squeezing and a woman showed Orla the way her sink no longer sulked when the weather changed. At dusk, the first new word for what they had done arrived in town and stuck on three mouths. It was not a better word than Listening, but it did a job: Tuning. It was the sort of word men could say without feeling like they were borrowing a dress and the sort of word women could say without wanting to hide. It would do until someone coined a better song, and in the meantime the pipes, with moods and elbows and courtesy when asked, kept their end of the bargain and made the city sound small enough to hear when it needed to and big enough to carry them when it had to.",

The gutters, cocky after their education, tried out ornaments at the end of phrases that made the old women laugh and the young men roll their eyes like dice. Ductwork exhaled with the weary grandeur of sopranos in cheap operas. Children drew notes on the sidewalk in chalk, letters inside circles with arrows pointing to downspouts like treasure maps made for people who already knew where the treasure lived. The Registry attempted a rebrand on a Tuesday afternoon and papered a few bus shelters with an advertisement that read Tuning: Powered by Community, Sponsored by Us. The poster had a microphone wearing a halo and a wrench wearing sunglasses. Somebody\u2019s aunt peeled one down and used it to line a cabinet drawer as if citizenship could be made useful by getting close to the flour.\n\nThe three of them\u2014the woman with the maps, the woman with the cranes, the woman with the mouth\u2014stood in the Library\u2019s back room and stared at a stack of requests until the paper looked like a topographical feature you might have to give a name to. The stacks were tied with string and punctuated by fruit stickers, the unofficial stamp of neighborhood legit. Help us with the vents in the rec center, wrote a man who had accidentally raised three daughters into women and was still surprised by the competence that haunted his kitchen table. The clinic sent a note on a sheet that had once been a list of syringes: the exam room sings like a swamp; teach us to make it less cruel. The aunties proposed Thursday nights on purpose. The teenagers asked if they could come and if they had to be quiet and the answer to both was no if you were clever and yes if you were not.\n\nJun, promoted into a position that came with an impressive lanyard and the ability to stall whole departments with a phone call, set up a calendar whose days looked like teeth. She drew a grid called Tuning Bench: Parishes and Pumps, because the city still thought of itself in parishes even when it pretended to be districts and zones. Keziah scavenged a rolling cart and turned it into a kit\u2014coils of cable like patient snakes, a battered amp, a fist of microphones, a multimeter she had named Patience in a black marker hand that refused to be decorative. Orla sorted the calls into songs\u2014rooms that needed the A-sharp because stubbornness was baked into their drywall, alleys that wanted E because old bricks carried grief like a flavor, stairwells that needed the note a person makes when she sees herself in a mirror and decides she will keep the day anyway.\n\nThe Lanyard called with a request that sounded like a trap and turned out to be an invitation to guard the trap\u2019s hinges. \u201cCivic Phonetics Council,\u201d she said, apologetic for the title and not for the room. \u201cIf you don\u2019t sit at it, someone will, and they\u2019ll end up naming a form after you that does a thing you hate. Come make shapes on paper that your aunties can walk through.\u201d Jun agreed before Orla could groan, on the theory that no room should be left without the possibility of mercy, and also because she wanted to see if a committee could be tuned. Keziah went too and wore a shirt with an oil stain she refused to apologize for, and three men in suits who had come prepared to be charmed into obedience found themselves behaving genuinely because the room\u2019s air had been altered by competence. They won nothing and a half measure on the first day: not permits, but windows; not licenses, but a schedule pinned to bulletin boards and the back of the pastor\u2019s door that read Tuning Hours, Civic Courtesy Requested. It was not justice, but it was room.\n\nMen who saw a commons as a store window began to arrange products behind glass. A company with three syllables and a logo that resembled a smile selling you more of your own mouth launched GateTone: Personal Acoustic Governance. Their billboard in the warehouse district showed an apartment building at night, ten lit windows and one dark, with the promise Mute Your Nuisances. Landlords bought small chrome boxes and screwed them into walls. The boxes threw a bright, ugly slice of ultrasonic into rooms where babies were finally sleeping and women were teaching their throats to be tools, and the sound made plaster remember earthquakes and cats develop opinions that bordered on sermon. In a week, the floor of the Library under the blueprints was covered with boxes; aunties had begged maintenance men and threatened nephews until they came down off the walls into hands that knew which screws would keep a device from ever being mounted again.\n\nThey organized a kind of rude politeness called a Quiet Strike. It began in a building owned by a man whose name was a rumor and whose desk had no dust because he had no books. Keziah mapped the electric, the path the chrome boxes took to sip power as if power were free if it was thin enough. Jun printed a flier that said in letters that refused to be pretty: We Are Not Furniture. Orla showed up, stood in the hallway where the paint remembered what it used to be, and sang not a note but a ceiling. The aunties at either end of the corridor held the B the way they hold a baby they are not obligated to love and do anyway. The boxes sighed and went dumb, their internal clocks suddenly remembering they were mortal. Downstairs, a handyman with a gambler\u2019s luck cut power at the panel and shrugged at a superintendent who had never learned from a woman. The Lanyard, who had learned which committees to leave early and which to suffocate gently from behind, arrived with a form in triplicate and a voice like a hairpin. \u201cThese devices,\u201d she said aloud for the hallway to hear, \u201chave not been permitted for any purpose beyond making men comfortable,\u201d and the form\u2019s word for that was a code that made the building flinch. The devices left the neighborhood in a box, and the box left the city on a truck, and the truck driver told his cousin that women had tuned a hall until a company lost its appetite.\n\nA school on the east side had an auditorium shaped like a secret. It had never liked being asked to sit still. The teenagers discovered that a certain sweet interval made the back wall shiver, a purr that climbed into polite terror if they got stubborn. Orla caught it before it caught them by committing the most radical act a teacher can commit in a room full of children who are partly made of physics: she told them the truth. You can crack a room like an egg, she said, and the whoops began and she raised a palm and waited for quiet to get bored and wander away. We are not cracking it. We are cooking. She showed them the difference between ringing a thing to hear its name and pounding a thing until it lies. She had them sing the A and then a hair higher and then say with their throats We are done now and mean it. The auditorium nodded like a friend who respects a limit. That evening, a boy attempted to impress a cousin by humming at the elevator in his building the way rumor had taught him to, and the elevator answered with a hiss. An auntie told him to try that noise on a pot lid instead. He did, and learned more empathy for metal in an hour than three years of discipline had taught him.\n\nThe dry city\u2019s offer to Keziah evolved the way fruit does in a bowl: riper in appearance, softer underneath, sweet until rot set in. It came with numbers that would soften anyone\u2019s stride and a laboratory with floor drains polished until they looked like vows. It came with prestige and three key cards and the promise of clean. It came with conditions, one of which was polite and obscene: leave the rust; we like our metal new. Keziah put the letter in her back pocket and forgot it there. She called her mother and spoke about weather and filters and the price of eggs and not at all about love until her mother asked, like a woman opening a cabinet on a mouse, \u201cIs there a woman?\u201d Keziah laughed until her throat hurt. After she hung up, she went to the yard and stood on the catwalk with Orla, not touching, and said, without needing the word, \u201cStay.\u201d Orla did not make it a vow. She put her wrist against Keziah\u2019s and let their pulses count each other until a pump kicked on and handed them an excuse to move.\n\nIn a drawer under Rowan\u2019s old radio, Orla found a cassette that had no label and a crack in the plastic like a healed wound. When she fed it to a player she had kept for the sound of history, the tape rolled out a murmur that was not a song yet, something he had hummed under a sink and then spoken over\u2014You have to listen to the space, not the note\u2014then hummed again, lower, in the range that makes a room mind its manners. There, under the sound of his work, under the thump of a wrench against a pan he had mistaken for a tool, lived a rhythm she did not recognize. It was not Nine\u2019s latch nor Seven\u2019s sulk. It was an older gate, one not on any map she\u2019d held, a Sluice with a number that had retired out of shame. She took the player to the Library and fed it to a machine in the genealogy room because the machine had the glove hands of a person who had learned to hold fragile things. Jun watched the waveform climb the screen and laid one transparency over another. Fourteen, she said, as if admitting it. The hospital. Somebody had walled Fourteen up just after the expansion under the emergency department. Someone had made a decision in a litigable mood and told the concrete to forget how to be a door.\n\nThe heat wave announced itself not with weather alerts but with behavior. Men on stoops argued less loudly because arguing throws heat from the body. The bus driver turned the air to four and apologized to nobody. A man who sold ice negotiated the price of mercy with women who had spent the morning calling old people to see which ones would answer. Air conditioners coughed into the ductwork like small monsters that flung heat out their backs with indignation and were not efficient at any task other than noise. The grid\u2014a word that felt clean and geometric in the mouths of men who never touched a wire\u2014began to pant. The power company issued a soft statement and a stern one, in that order, and none of it sang. Someone posted on the Listening board that the hum inside their wall sounded like a child pulling a wagon up a hill with a handle too short, and the reply gathered faster than news.\n\nTuning made a new kind of work in the heat: not redirecting water but smoothing appetite. Keziah met the plant manager at the substation with the expression she used on bolts she needed to out-stare. She listened to the big transformer the way a mother listens to a fever. Jun negotiated with a dispatcher at a console that would have preferred to be left alone. Orla climbed into rooms that smelled like old carpet and impatience and taught women to sing to the window units at the start of the hour and then shut them for a breath when the grid was black in the eyes. The sound did not move electricity along the wire like soup in a hose; it did something smaller and stranger. It changed the way compressors hated their own load, so that they took a breath in unison instead of five of them gasping at once. It taught certain walls to accept heat the way wood accepts an apology if it\u2019s made before the cut. The one thing she did at scale in those days, which made her laugh three days later when she had recovered enough to admit it, was lead a city in group exhale at two in the afternoon. The Registry tried to brand it Breather Day and everybody ignored it and did it anyway.\n\nThe Civic Phonetics Council, which had been created in haste to control a rumor and had then discovered it contained women who could count, convened a hearing about the Decibel Credit Bank in a chamber where the carpet remembered feet that had run out to tell the truth and chairs that had sat on hands. Men came with charts. One wore a tie that looked like confidence printed on fabric. He explained that Tuning should be monetized in credits and liabilities to bring it within the discipline of finance and allow civic valorization of decibel reduction events. Jun set her pen down with a sound that was not a sound. Keziah\u2019s eyelids did a thing with their edges that could cut if you leaned wrong. Orla let him finish because she was saving an interruption for a better use. When it was her turn, she put her hand flat on the table and spoke as if the microphone were a pipe.\n\n\u201cYou cannot bank a chord,\u201d she said evenly. \u201cYou can learn it and teach it and remember it and let it change you and you can ask it for help and sometimes it will. You cannot own it any more than you can own the rain you choose not to throw away.\u201d She explained\u2014in nouns the men had used and verbs they had forgotten\u2014what a kitchen sounds like when you bring a lifelong clatter into measure. She named three kinds of tired that Tuning could not cure. She sang, once, low, not for effect but to show the carpet. The carpet answered by unbending its knees in a subtle way that anyone who had ever knelt could feel. The chair of the council, a woman who had learned to keep patience in a pocket like a worry stone, ruled that credits would not be banked and fines would not be levied on music done for the purpose of keeping buildings from screaming. The Decibel Bank, deprived of its glamour, became a grant with a bad name and a shorter leash.\n\nGateTone did not go quietly. In the low pool where \u201cinnovation\u201d sits when it has been told no but thinks it is smarter than the river, their engineers wrote code that listened for the aunties\u2019 vowels and threw static at them. It caused no harm but irritation in living rooms of women who had lost their patience three minutes after they were born. The aunties stopped singing for three days out of spite, and in that silence men heard their refrigerators complaining and their own heartbeats making dull cases for rest and the static sounded like failure. Lanyard sent an email in a tone that mixed rosary and sword; the subject line read License Enforcement, the body read stop it, and attached was the Commons paper stamped so indelibly the PDF might have started to smell like ink. GateTone\u2019s stock newsletter featured a photo of a child wearing orange ear defenders next to a bowl of lemons, as if selling problems to the rich would make the poor less loud. Their market slid sideways on a Tuesday while the city tuned a clinic\u2019s radiator until an old man could fall asleep in a chair without thinking of war.\n\nThey did not march on Sluice Fourteen. They went like a family going to a doctor they cannot avoid. The hospital did not want them and had wanted them for years. Down under the supply docks, beyond a door whose alarm had been muted the year a man with a clipboard retired and took with him the habit of noticing, the wall had been sealed with a confidence that made Keziah\u2019s mouth taste like tin. Jun had found the paper trail\u2014signatures like dried tongue\u2014and an addendum taped to an old file the way you tape a bandage on a leak when you are done caring how a room smells. Orla pressed her palm to the concrete and told it a story about memory that did not accuse it of anything. A nurse with a face like competence and a posture like a doorframe found them and made the face of a person deciding whether to call a supervisor or put her hand on the wall next to Orla\u2019s and say the quiet words she had been saying to the building in the wrong places for a decade. When she put her palm to the seam her hand warmed. The wall, out of embarrassment more than repentance, agreed to forget the lie it had learned.\n\nIt was the most careful they had ever been with a note. The NICU lived above them and the world above that room had been engineered to stay still in storms. Orla built the chord as if she were setting chairs for breakfast, because breakfast is when a house hears what sort of day it is going to be. The nurse hummed a tone she had learned to use when a mother did not want to be touched. Keziah found the pins and asked them out of the holes as if they let themselves be removed all the time. Jun explained to a man with a badge why the Commons license, which had never been designed for rooms like this, spoke here with particular authority. The seal listened. Concrete holds grudges; this time it laid one down. Fourteen opened less like a door and more like a throat that has forgotten how to swallow and has just remembered a recipe.\n\nThe hospital learned to tune its own air. It took ten days, three meetings, and one woman whose title was Floor Manager and whose other title was Grandma to convince the administration that letting aunties hum in corridors at shift change was not a security breach but a kind of insurance you can\u2019t buy, only earn. Rooms that had been built for flow became rooms that asked permission to be harsh. The elevators gave back a little of the sting they held for women who had been lifted through them half-awake. A janitor who had learned to move like a rumor in that place asked to borrow the tuning cart for ten minutes and returned it with a piece of tape placed precisely under a rattle on the amp\u2019s handle, the kind of gift no committee can authorize and none should be allowed to forbid.\n\nUpstream, the binder woman and her aunties had turned the weir into a weekly appointment. They called it Weir Wednesday because it made a kind of pleasure out of logistics and because men do not suspect danger when a day is named something that might be a discount at a diner. The River Compact glowered in the way of organizations that would like to be worshiped and have been invited to be useful. Jun sent them a copy of the license in the mail with a note that read this applies upstream and down and an old-fashioned stamp that made the paper smell like a story. The operator put a sign in his own window that read She Likes B, a declaration of love if you knew how to read it.\n\nThe boy with the hairnet became a boy with keys. He arrived at the yard with a problem nobody had asked him to solve and a box of cold pickles, the old recipe, not the hurtful acid that had got them into this mess. He had been listening to a rattle in the catwalk. He had learned where bolts go when they don\u2019t feel at home. Keziah took him up one rung too far and asked him to look through the hole in the grate. He looked, and then looked at her, and in that exchange inherited a new job even if his paycheck never learned its right name for it. Orla taught him to hold the E the way you hold a breath when something sharp is passing. Jun trained his eye to see when men try to slip a budget under a door while calling it a rug.\n\nThe school gym became a training hall between storms. They chalked circles on the floor and put labels on them that were names and keys and cities disguised as chores. Aunties led the young in singing while a ceiling fan decided to wobble less. A pair of boys practiced being bolts by standing with their feet planted and their mouths closed and their eyes open while someone sang around them. The shy girl with the braid too tight came back with her hair looser and taught a boy with the sort of pride that makes a person pretend not to know how to hold a broom to hold the A-sharp without being a bully. A man who had been wrong in three different rooms and been forgiven in two of them sat on the edge of the bleachers and learned to keep his hands open while a note passed by, and when it ended, he did not clap, he only breathed in the right place and didn\u2019t eat anyone\u2019s air.\n\nThe rumor with better shoes\u2014the one with a polished slide deck\u2014climbed the stairs of the municipal building again. Tone Insurance. Discounts for citizens who take mandatory Tuning instruction. Penalties for citizens who sing without permit. Credits for buildings that remain acoustically neutral. The lanyard, who now kept a paper copy of the Commons license under her keyboard like a saint\u2019s shinbone, rolled her chair back and invited Jun to sit in it. \u201cSay no in a way that teaches them to say yes later,\u201d she said, and Jun did, writing a policy with teeth that faced outward only in case of biting and a velvet interior that read: if you tune to make people safe, you are safe. Hidden in the footnotes was an impossible sentence that had wandered out of a different discipline: Silence is neither innocent nor neutral; do not make a god of it. The chair whose moral structure had been implied by the extra inch in its back accepted the sentence into the minutes and pretended it had always known.\n\nThey named their cart without naming it by ensuring it was always called ours. It went where it was told not to\u2014interior courtyards the Registry would have preferred to permit, back rooms behind stores where women swapped recipes for stubbornness and cinnamon. It went to the fish market, where a compressor had been taught to whine by men who didn\u2019t mind because they were wrong in less important ways and you had to pick your battles; it learned to grin instead, and the fish tasted less like apology and more like sea. It went to the stadium, where the City wanted photographs of women saving men\u2019s money, and it went under the photos and tuned the concessions cooler until hot dogs could be tolerated without reparations.\n\nThe next attempt at theft came not as a billboard but as a grant. One of the foundations beloved by men who like to put their names on buildings offered to fund a Center for Civic Acoustical Excellence, with a logo already designed, a time-lapse video already cut, and a list of preferred vendors whose preferences tracked the donor\u2019s golf habit. They asked to house it in the Library. They said the name of the library wrong and then shrugged. Jun led them into the stacks and showed them a slim volume from the 1930s, a woman\u2019s doctoral thesis in a discipline no department existed for anymore. The woman had written about the difference between noise and harm and arranged into a table the ways a city can be cruel without being loud. \u201cWe have had a center since then,\u201d Jun said, with her librarian voice that sounded gentler than it was. \u201cIt is called here.\u201d The foundation men looked around and remembered that rooms can contain history that does not love them back. They left a check anyway, for less than they had hoped to be thanked for, and the money became four listening benches and six stipends for aunties who did not call them stipends but groceries.\n\nFourteen held. Nine held. Seven remained sulky and was bribered with oil and apology and eventually gave up its habit of sticking on the first rain. The basin took what it was given and made no speeches. The city adjusted its ear to the new normal with a huffy grace, like a grandparent learning where the salt is kept in a remodeled kitchen. GateTone tried to pivot into wellness and then into something with the word \u201csmart\u201d in it, and then into silence, which finally did it some good. The horns at the fence had a reunion where they did not honk and instead took a picture of their quiet faces with their children sitting on their shoulders to show them what men can do when they decide not to be loud. The Pickling Works foreman officiated, in an unofficial way, at a wedding in an alley because the paperwork could not outrun the weather; he looked at his notes and said three names almost wrong and then said them right and cried once into his towel where no one could see.\n\nNot all of it was victory. An old building on the south edge of town sulked itself into a collapse because the family that owned it had moved to a place with air that never learned voices and the building missed names. Nobody died because a boy with a skateboard heard a tone he knew how to be afraid of and told everybody out. A man who hated Orla\u2019s mouth organized a listening of his own in a basement where he taught boys to hold a note until the house had to agree with them, and later those boys pushed their girlfriends into corners and swore it was music; the girlfriends told each other, and the aunties came with folding chairs and sat in the room until nobody could stand to sing wrong anymore. A committee in another city called to ask how to measure it for printing on glossy paper, and Jun laughed into the phone and told them to come stand in the traffic circle until their shoes could hear, and the person on the other end said travel wasn\u2019t in the budget, and everybody learned something about sincerity.\n\nAt last, on a morning that had oil on it and promised heat without relief, a knock arrived that had not been in any plan. A woman wearing a suit that had suffered humidity with more dignity than the men inside it handed Orla a folded letter and stood there like a gate that would not allow you to mistake it for a wall. The letter had the city\u2019s crest on it and the Registry\u2019s alphabetical swagger and a paragraph towards the bottom that read in the old, lazy code\u2019s new plain language: The backdoor is closed. The door is open. Please enter any time. The signature had the chair\u2019s expensive name on it and, below it, in the handwriting of a clerk who had learned to put grants in the right pile, the words: we kept the hinge and threw away the lock. Orla took it and didn\u2019t smile and, after she had shut the door, laughed on behalf of the door, which had loved being a metaphor and would now have to settle for being a piece of simple wood that kept weather out and women in until they decided otherwise.\n\nAt the Listening that night\u2014the one nobody scheduled and everybody arrived at\u2014Orla did not stand on the bucket arm. She stood behind the aunties and let the room pick its leader. The shy girl with the loose braid stepped into the circle before anybody else and lifted her chin like a plumb bob. The A-sharp was hers, now, and she held it with the kind of gentleness that makes a room honest. The teenagers slid a blue note in because they had not given up their insistence on the future, and the room forgave them because that insistence was bought fairly from the day. Keziah leaned against a post and did not count; she let herself believe the bolts were tight until they proved her wrong. Jun folded her arms and watched the weave of the sound make patterns on the paper in her lap she hadn\u2019t drawn and wouldn\u2019t need to. Orla kept her mouth shut because sometimes the most radical act in a city full of elbows is to teach a room to hold itself and then step out of its light.\n\nNight afterward came with the small romance of body heat evaporating from concrete. The cranes drew themselves into letters nobody knew yet and would learn to read only after mispronouncing them for a decade. The basin sighed. The ducts negotiated curfew with their own opinions and agreed to be quiet enough for children without losing face. Orla lay on her floor and stared at the thin crack in the ceiling she had been promising herself to fix and kept not fixing because it was honest. She sang into her palm a line she had been carrying since the day at the weir and let it go, finally, like a bird you had fed with a medicine dropper. It was the line about paint remembering it was sky. It was also about bolts that don\u2019t brag. It was about rooms that let you in without asking who your grandfather was and what you had eaten. When she woke, the radio was telling the difference between weather and consequences and had started, gingerly, to describe repair.\n\nIn the morning, a message arrived from the county that had learned to sing to its weir. The binder woman had drafted it with a pencil on lined paper and then typed it because she respected the fact that cities like their words printable. It invited them to a gathering called Swap Meet: Songs and Knives. Bring a note you don\u2019t mind someone else taking home. Bring a recipe for patching a hole. Bring a tool and explain why it is not a weapon. The three of them looked at the paper and said yes so fast it made the air laugh. They packed the cart until it looked like a friend moving to a better apartment. They left the posters and the permits behind. In the back of the van, the mermaid\u2019s devil tail caught the light and turned into something that looked very much like a blessing and nothing at all like forgiveness.",
