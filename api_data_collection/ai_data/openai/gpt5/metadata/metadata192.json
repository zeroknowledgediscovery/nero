     "novel_text": "He said water was the only thing that never lied, but then again, he said a lot of things in the morning when the light came in flat through the curtains and the birds along Nelson Mandela Drive screeched like someone had begun to pry open the sky. Pretoria mornings always made Kabelo feel accused. There was the chlorine \u2014 a cough of it lingering like a bad joke on his throat \u2014 and there was the old woman next door dragging her mop across the stoep, the sound like felt wrapped around a blade. And there was something else, a press, the same one that told him to jump when he was on the higher dive board and the pool below looked like a moving mouth.\n\nHe tied the elastic of his goggles around his wrist before he left, a reflex, like a charm. You don\u2019t need it on the road, but still. He slung his thick towel over his shoulder, the one with a faded Springbok emblem, and stepped into the cooler hallway that smelled of cooking oil and dust. His mother had fallen asleep on the couch again, the TV still buzzing from a replay of a series where everyone spoke with the sort of clipped English that made his teeth ache. He switched it off with his toe.\n\n\u201cMama,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI\u2019m going now.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t wake, or if she did, she pretended not to, because she had learned when he needed words and when he needed silence. Her hair was wrapped in a pink scarf; her wrists were stacked with cheap bangles that clinked even in sleep. His own wrists were bare except for the goggle elastic. He thought of kissing her forehead. He didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t like to move sleeping people. What if you woke them into the wrong life?\n\nThe street outside already had its own breath. A white Quantum idled by the spaza shop where the owner, Mister Choi, was sweeping dust that would only return. A boy in an old Kaizer Chiefs jersey kicked a flat ball against the wall with the stubborn rhythm of someone calling down rain. The traffic light at the corner \u2014 the robot \u2014 lagged, clicked, lagged, surrendered. A woman in a nurse uniform smoked under a jacaranda that had not yet decided if it would flower. It was too early for purple. It was not too early for smoke.\n\nHe started down the road with the towel over his shoulder and his plastic sandals making that slap-slap-slap. Water, he thought. Water is waiting. It was a singular thought but it made itself big, like all true simple things do. He walked past Auntie Mavis\u2019s place and she came out, hips first, hair curlers like an army.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re off to drown yourself again,\u201d she said. \u201cTell your mother I\u2019m making that samp she likes. And tell her to stop letting you carry on with this thing. There\u2019s no future inside water.\u201d\n\nHe laughed, because the only other option was to argue. \u201cMorning, Auntie,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t say: if there\u2019s no future inside water then what about inside air? What about inside all this?\n\n\u201cShe has nightmares when you\u2019re out,\u201d she went on. \u201cYou know that? She sees you going down and not coming up again. And you with those skinny legs.\u201d\n\nHe flexed his leg as if that would fix it. \u201cI\u2019ll be back. I always come back. You know.\u201d\n\n\u201cHah,\u201d she said. \u201cYou only come back because God is too busy to collect you right now. Go, go. Tell your mother about the samp. And don\u2019t look people in the eyes. Not these days.\u201d\n\nIn Pretoria nobody said they were scared, except when they did, but they did it like a joke. He kept his eyes down and counted steps. If he reached the municipal pool before the sun broke clean over the Fountains, he could have it almost to himself. The hawkers at the corner were still setting out sunglasses and cheap cellphone covers, and the taxis had not yet grown impatient enough to sound like an orchestra of crows.\n\nAt the pool gates, the guard looked him over and then looked at the towel.\n\n\u201cYou again,\u201d the guard said.\n\n\u201cMe again,\u201d he said, with the good smile he saved for adults.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got that thing today? That competition thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cPractice,\u201d he said, because they\u2019d had this conversation enough times that it had its own first line.\n\nInside the fences the grass was tight-cut and the water was still, as if nobody had ever put a body into it. He liked that. The idea that he could break the skin of a thing that did not mind being broken. He shrugged off the towel and untied the elastic from his wrist and slipped the goggles up. His cap was already on under his hoodie; he liked to feel the binding of it, the way it made his thoughts sleek.\n\n\u201cStarfish,\u201d he said to himself, and then he slid in, and the water climbed him like a beloved.\n\nSome days he counted laps and some days he refused. Today the blue and white lane ropes blurred into one continuous stripe. His body found its rhythm almost greedily, arms spearing forward, pull, breath to the right. He had a drill he\u2019d made up himself \u2014 the Pretorian Serpent, he\u2019d named it, even though nobody, not even his friend Bongani, knew what he meant when he grinned and said the name. It wasn\u2019t showy, mostly. It was quiet and focused and then it exploded. He could hold his breath under for longer than most. He could draw himself over the water as if it were glass, and sometimes in his head there was music, weird music, not the type they play on the radio. He sometimes imagined it would make people cry, watching him. Even the ones who didn\u2019t care about water would be forced to care, if they saw how he could slice it open and then stitch it closed again with a flick of ankle.\n\nHe swam and he swam and then he was standing and the world came back: the guard discussing politics with a woman in a maroon top, the cicadas turning themselves into a chorus, the smell of fried vetkoek floating over from the stall that had popped up by the fence. He blinked water out of his lashes and he smiled, but the smile felt like it belonged to someone else.\n\nThe email was waiting when he got home, but he didn\u2019t know it yet. He stood at the kitchen sink and ate two bananas and half a cucumber, the cucumber because it tasted like cool water and he wanted to be extra today. He towelled his hair, he checked the bruise along his ribs \u2014 he didn\u2019t remember getting it, which annoyed him \u2014 and he made coffee so strong you could have floated a coin on it.\n\nHis mother was awake now, the scarf slipping back from her forehead, and she rubbed her eyes with both fists like a child. \u201cYou back,\u201d she said, then switched to Setswana, which she did when she was softer. \u201cDid you fly this morning?\u201d\n\n\u201cI flew,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone clapped.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re stupid,\u201d she said fondly. \u201cCome. Eat something. Auntie Mavis sent samp. She\u2019s trying to own me with food.\u201d\n\nKabelo touched her shoulder, then took his phone off the charger. It vibrated in his hand in that particular way that meant an email had dived into the inbox. He had sent his video last week, the one Bongani filmed at the little pool at the gym in town because he couldn\u2019t get permission to use the large pool after hours. \u201cA nation of rules,\u201d he\u2019d said then, half-laughing, because it was easier to laugh when doors were iron. He had cut and edited on his old second-hand laptop until the trackpad was smooth and unresponsive. He had sent the email to a set of addresses that had all looked official in an odd way \u2014 icons and banners and the right spelling \u2014 and then he had tried not to think about them.\n\nThe subject line was not that long. It read: Congratulations! Finalist Notification.\n\nHe felt something wobble in him. He felt his knuckles go cold, which didn\u2019t make sense because surely they should have got hot. He clicked.\n\nDear Mr. K. Maseko,\n\nWe are delighted to inform you that your audition has exceeded expectations.\n\nThe word delighted threw him. It did not have an easy translation that his mother used, and it also did not include space for doubt. He read it again, and again.\n\n\u2026 we wish to invite you to participate in the live Final in London, United Kingdom, scheduled one month from today\u2019s date\u2026\n\nHe felt the house tilt. He broadened his stance without realizing it. He thought of planes, those long white birds that made his stomach do tricks. Bongani at the garage, leaning on the petrol pump and saying, \u201cThey\u2019re not birds, be serious,\u201d but then also, \u201cBro, imagine you on TV with the lights. Imagine the likes.\u201d\n\nHe put the phone down on the table as if it were something that could overheat and take the plastic with it. He spread his fingers out. He could hear his mother fussing with plates on trays. He could hear the neighbor\u2019s radio going out of tune. He could hear something else: something under it all, a low note, the kind divers must get to hear when they\u2019re very close to the bottom. He picked the phone up again. He read the email from start to end. His name. His cheaply-shot video described as innovative. An itinerary attached as a PDF. Accreditation. A promise of accommodation near the theatre. \u201cTheatre,\u201d he said aloud, pronouncing each syllable, feeling silly and formal. He clicked the attachment and something heavy in the air got heavier. There was a logo. There were contact numbers. There was the promise of a small advance if he needed to secure travel before the full production arrangements. \u201cWe are delighted,\u201d it repeated. \u201cThe British public will be delighted.\u201d That was a different use, the word being stretchier than it had any right to be.\n\n\u201cMa,\u201d he said, and then louder: \u201cMama.\u201d\n\nShe came out with the tray, the way of someone who had been carrying trays since she was a girl and would never put one down until it was completed: two plates with the samp, a jug of water with one thin slice of lemon floating in it like a coin, a spoon for the sugar she wouldn\u2019t use. \u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d she said. \u201cYou think I\u2019m not coming.\u201d\n\nHe thrust the phone at her. She took it but didn\u2019t look. \u201cWe read things sitting down,\u201d she said by reflex, and they did.\n\nThey sat and she apologized for the tray noise and put the ear of the phone to her ear like you do with a call if you don\u2019t live in the world of cars that park themselves and fridges that talk. \u201cRead for me,\u201d she said. \u201cYour English is faster.\u201d\n\nHe read. He did it twice, because he could hear how it sounded as it left his mouth and then he could hear how unreal it was and then, when he did it a second time, it began to gain weight and shape. She nodded, very slow, the way she did when she was trying to keep a lid on a laugh.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d he echoed.\n\n\u201cSo you are big now.\u201d\n\nHe couldn\u2019t help it; his laugh was a bark. \u201cIt\u2019s the final,\u201d he said, like someone who would be believed. \u201cThey didn\u2019t ask me for money or anything. They\u2019re sending things. There\u2019s a list.\u201d\n\nHis mother wiped her mouth with a napkin although she had not yet eaten. \u201cA list of what,\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cPassport, of course.\u201d He gulped the water as if it were news. \u201cSwimwear. Costs they will cover. \u2018Talent coordination.\u2019 Sounds like someone who makes sure I don\u2019t melt.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d she said, and her voice got soft and then it got serious, \u201cyou can\u2019t be tricked into boats with no engines.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an airplane,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou promise me. You promise me this has no man waiting to steal your passport.\u201d\n\n\u201cI promise. It\u2019s the\u2026 it\u2019s Britain\u2019s Got Talent.\u201d The name itself made him nervous. It felt like a mountain.\n\nShe nodded: yes, she knew about these shows. She liked them, the way you like watching other people eat nicely, well, as if you are full only by association. Simon-with-the-T-shirts. The lady judge with the face like a Greek statue. The other one who always laughed too big for his tiny mouth. She said the names as though they were an aunty\u2019s children. \u201cBut this is you,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd those people will be looking with big, big eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be delighted,\u201d he said, and then he laughed because the word sounded sweet in his teeth.\n\nHe called Bongani. He didn\u2019t know how else to keep from catching fire in his own chest. The call took a long time to connect; the towers were sulking. When it did, the noise of the garage came through before the voice did: air spitting, a drill, tires shunted, someone asking for change.\n\n\u201cHear me,\u201d Bongani shouted. \u201cI am working. If you want me to love you, buy me a cool drink.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to London,\u201d Kabelo said, not yet aware that this would always be the sentence that split his life into the before and after. \u201cTo the final. The email came. I\u2019m in. I have one month.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause. Then: \u201cLike the show-show?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe show-show. The one people talk about as if it were a church.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d Bongani said. \u201cYou. Hey, man. You\u2019re going to swim in front of those white people and make them faint.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be delighted,\u201d he said again. He was starting to feel the shape of the word in his body.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Bongani said, and his tone shifted because he could be both clown and father in the space of a breath. \u201cOkay, okay. Listen. We have to go to church.\u201d He meant the place where men gathered to make plans and make them foolishly big. He meant the shisa nyama by the field where you could buy a braai pack and then hold court in the smoke. He meant telling everyone even the ones you weren\u2019t sure liked you. He meant becoming so loud that even the silence would have to listen. \u201cTonight. We go tonight. I\u2019m not waiting.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mother,\u201d he said, but then his mother nodded, as if she had heard both sides of the conversation. She was that sort of person.\n\n\u201cTonight,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will go two hours only, come back early. We will phone the lice place.\u201d\n\nHe laughed because this was one of her jokes, a joke about visas that had turned into visas being fleas, and then fleas being lice, and then the embassy being the place where lice lived. She made up the words and the world tried and failed to keep up.\n\nHe spent the afternoon not sure where to look. He looked at the ceiling of his room and noticed a stain that had shaped itself into a dragon. He looked at his toes and felt a sudden panic that they were too long. He looked at his passport \u2014 sense memory of the queue to get it, the man behind the glass barely looking up \u2014 and he looked at his old suitcase and he looked at the spot where his father had used to sit, if he\u2019d ever sat at all. He went to Mr. Lategan, who had technically been his coach once, in the way that a man at the Tuks pool can be a coach if he shouts enough at the right time.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d Mr. Lategan said, as if he were accusing him of stealing something. \u201cLondon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI thought you were joking.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said to find a stage. I found one.\u201d His smile was something that could have been a mistake.\n\nMr. Lategan nodded as if he were chewing an idea. He had small, bright eyes that held onto things longer than they should. \u201cBe careful,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOf the cold?\u201d He tried to make it light.\n\n\u201cOf the part where you think you are the same person on TV as you are here. That\u2019s ice. People slip.\u201d He paused. \u201cYou know your left shoulder drops when you\u2019re tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said, though he didn\u2019t, not really. He would watch it now. He tried to square his shoulders right then.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do too much. They like shiny. But they like simple. And you are\u2014 \u201d\n\nHe left it there. And you are. One day he would fill the blank with something kind. For now it hung.\n\nHe didn\u2019t tell his mother about what he saw at the pool, later that afternoon when he sneaked back after the kids got out and the sun was making diamonds on the surface. He didn\u2019t tell her that a woman had stood by the side with a clipboard and watched him as if she knew his middle name. He didn\u2019t tell her that when he had looked up to smile, because he couldn\u2019t help smiling at anyone who looked serious, she had turned away so fast her hair lifted and he\u2019d seen something stuck to her neck \u2014 a small plaster, or a bit of tape, or a sticker. He didn\u2019t tell his mother how he thought he saw her again later by the robots, standing under the jacaranda with a bag that didn\u2019t belong to the season. She could have been anyone. She could have been no one at all. The city was full of repeated faces. The city was a game of memory that nobody won.\n\nThey went to the shisa nyama when the light folded itself down into the gaps between buildings. Bongani bought the meat because he insisted that success should be tasted in salt first. Men clapped him on the back and some called him \u201cMr. London\u201d and some made a point of asking him what he would do there without meat as if that were the only thing that mattered. Older men told him about the cold and the way the women spoke and how their beer was not beer at all. They sang his name wrong on purpose and made up more stories. It felt good. He felt like a wooden chair right by the fire, he felt useful. He didn\u2019t drink. He put his hands out to the smoke and he listened to the fat sizzle and he thought of how, in a month, he would feel a different kind of wind on his face.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your trick?\u201d a boy asked him, leaning in under the smoke, his face slippery with the oil from the meat. \u201cWhat are you going to do that makes it more than just splashing?\u201d\n\nHe leaned down until they were eye to eye. \u201cI\u2019m going to hold my breath so long they\u2019ll think I\u2019ve gone, then I\u2019ll come up and they\u2019ll be so relieved they\u2019ll love me forever.\u201d\n\nThe boy nodded solemnly, as if relief was a trick you could rehearse. \u201cYou must not drown,\u201d he said, as if it were a secret.\n\n\u201cI must not,\u201d he agreed.\n\nWater remembers.\n\nAt night, when the house finally stopped arguing with itself \u2014 the fridge, the pipes, the bed \u2014 and his mother had gone to bed with a sigh of relief that she did not speak aloud, he lay awake and scrolled. He watched clips of the show and he watched people who had done things that did not make sense: a woman pretending to be a dog and making judges weep with laughter; a boy with a voice like a radio in a long, clean room; a group of dancers with bones that did things bones should not be able to do. He watched until the screen began to blue his face and he felt like maybe he was already somewhere else. He scrolled through the itinerary again. Heathrow. A car to the hotel. A rehearsal call sheet. Talent coordination. He googled the name of the coordinator and found a LinkedIn profile with a picture of a woman with good teeth. He googled the producer. He typed the names into Facebook and found people with the same names in completely different cities, one of whom was a chef who loved sausages.\n\nHe looked up swimming pools in London. He sketched out a plan on the back of an envelope: two swims before the final; one day to rest; a walk along the Thames, which he had heard was brown and cold and smelled like old money. He read about visas and then he read about how cold air will hurt inside your nose. He watched a video of a man throwing boiling water into the air to make snow. He shivered, imagining his lungs shrinking and then opening like fists.\n\nHe fell asleep with the phone on his chest. He woke once in the night and thought he saw someone standing in the doorway, but when he sat up, the shape went flat against the night. He lay back down, told himself his pulse was a tired thing, then counted breaths until the sleep returned and smothered him, gently, with both hands.\n\nThe next morning it felt as if the city had been dipped in something. The sky was brighter than manners allowed. He made a list on a piece of cardboard because paper felt too fragile. Baths to be taken. Shoes to be bought with soles intact. Use of the church bag as a travel carry-on if he could get the wax off it. He phoned the embassy \u2014 the lice place \u2014 and waited in the queue while a recorded voice told him about opening hours and the happiness to serve him. A woman came on the line and he spoke too fast. He did it twice. He booked an appointment. He hung up and paced the length of the small hallway and nearly walked into Auntie Mavis, who had appeared silently with a covered bowl.\n\n\u201cYou must eat,\u201d she said, even before greeting. \u201cYou cannot go on a plane with nothing in your stomach. They don\u2019t feed black people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey do,\u201d he said, and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bus to Polokwane.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t feed black people,\u201d she repeated, unbothered, and then she uncovered the bowl to show him something that was both stew and memory. \u201cAlso, look twice at anyone who looks at you longer than they blink. That\u2019s how they take people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho,\u201d he began, and then stopped. There was a kind of superstition you did not invite. \u201cI\u2019ll eat,\u201d he said.\n\nHe kept moving because if he stopped, the weight of it might find him. He went to the pool and counted laps. He practiced his breath until the edges of the world got fluffy. He walked home differently, as if the streets were new and had to be learned again. He bought a pair of those long socks the rugby boys wore because something about compression felt like being hugged by someone with a good plan. He stopped by the garage and handed Bongani a cool drink and let him talk his way through every possible and impossible scenario on the plane: pilots faint, landing on a river, celebrities in first class who might need him to save them from choking on a nut.\n\nAround dusk he sat with his mother and set the documents out. He wrote a list of the things she would need while he was gone, even though it was only a week. The list had things on it that had no business there \u2014 as if the electricity would not know how to behave if he were not in the house. \u201cWe are not a country that breaks because you leave,\u201d she said, but smiled when she said it.\n\n\u201cPromise me,\u201d she added later, and her voice did a different thing. \u201cPromise me you will not leave me here without telling me if you decide to go forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cMa,\u201d he said, and his throat closed. \u201cI\u2019m not going forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cPromise,\u201d she said again, because she had learned about a different kind of knowing. He promised. He meant it.\n\nThat night he dreamed of a pool in London, but it wasn\u2019t a pool, it was a stage, and the water was not water, it was light moving the way water does. In the dream he walked from the wings and the audience was a single creature with millions of eyes. He did not feel scared because the light was so warm that it felt like a body he had known. He dove and did not fall. He hung, suspended, and then he turned his body into a rope that tied and untied itself. He heard the judges speaking over each other, but their words were jelly sweets, bright and useless. He rose from the water without wetness and when he looked out there was one face he knew, right in the front row: his father, who was either dead or just living in another town with a different memory. His father did not clap. He nodded once as if he\u2019d always been the kind of man who nodded for extraordinary things. It was not fair. He woke up angry and then laughed at himself for it. Dreams will do what they want with your blood. It isn\u2019t personal.\n\nHe went to the embassy with a folder that had his entire life folded into it. He stood in the queue behind a woman who was going to Manchester to see a sister and a man who was going to Birmingham to tend to a funeral. He listened to them say their cities as if cities were the names of unkind cousins. He tried to breathe like the people in the yoga videos. He handed over his passport and his bank statement and the invitation letter and tried not to sweat on the counter. He thought the woman behind the glass looked like a teacher, and that was a relief because teachers have to pretend to believe you.\n\n\u201cPurpose of your visit,\u201d she asked, although the letter nearly shouted it from the paper.\n\n\u201cPerformance,\u201d he said. \u201cBritain\u2019s Got Talent. The final.\u201d\n\nShe looked at him then and her face moved like someone readjusting a painting on the wall. \u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cWow.\u201d It was like catching a glimpse of a friend\u2019s real voice under the careful voice they use for outsiders. She printed something. She stamped something else. She said, \u201cYou will collect on Wednesday.\u201d\n\nHe stepped out of the building into the hot midday and the world didn\u2019t change, but he did. He watched a man selling knock-off sunglasses and thought: you\u2019re a seller of the future in plastic. He watched a little girl eating a lollipop as if it might whisper to her. He watched his own feet and thought: these, toes and all, are going to cross a line that a lot of people only see on maps.\n\nOn the way home he cut across the park. The grass had flattened itself as if to make way for him. A dog ran and then stopped and barked once at him, the sound more like a question than a threat. He saw a woman sitting on a bench, the same kind of clipboard woman from the pool, surely not the same, not really, but the hair the same. She looked at him and looked away and then looked down at her phone. It was nothing. It was everything. He walked slower and then faster and then he called Bongani because the sound of someone else\u2019s nonsense can sometimes scare away your own.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be on the plane and forget us,\u201d Bongani said without preamble. \u201cAnd then when you come back you\u2019ll speak like a kettle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll speak like a tap,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll say garridge instead of garage and you\u2019ll drink tea from a cup that\u2019s thin, thin like paper.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring you a cup,\u201d he promised.\n\n\u201cAnd biscuits,\u201d Bongani said. \u201cNot the hard ones. The ones that know their own mind.\u201d\n\nWhen he got home, his mother had packed and unpacked his bag twice. The first time had been efficient, the second had been emotional. There were things in the bag that had no border crossing ability: a carved wooden spoon; the faded photo of him and his father on the day the Apies River flooded and they\u2019d stood on the bridge watching other people\u2019s things rush away like they couldn\u2019t wait to be nothing.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take that,\u201d he said, lifting the spoon.\n\n\u201cYou will take it in your heart,\u201d she said. She folded it back in anyway, stubbornness layered on love.\n\nThe day before he left, his aunt in Atteridgeville phoned and told him her neighbor\u2019s child had seen him in a dream and in the dream he was wearing red and water was falling up the stairs. He had to wear blue, she said. He promised to wear blue, though he knew the costume they had asked for was silver because the lights would pick it up in a good way. He figured silver was a kind of blue, if you squinted. He said he would listen to dreams even when they were not his.\n\nAnd then finally it was the day. He slept maybe four hours in pieces. He got up before dawn and showered with the water too hot for the weather because he needed to feel washed by something that would sting. He shaved the hair along his legs because he\u2019d seen the swimmers on TV do that and because he loved the way water ran over skin that smooth. He didn\u2019t tell anyone that he sometimes shaved his arms, too. Men in garages would laugh and then ask to touch. He ate oats and hated them and ate them anyway. He checked the passport; he checked the invitation; he checked the charged battery on his phone; he checked the charger; he checked the piece of paper with the address of the hotel printed in big black letters as if words could make you more sure of a place. He kissed his mother\u2019s cheek and pretend-hit his Aunt\u2019s hand when she tried to slip money into his pocket. He allowed her to slip it anyway.\n\nAt the airport the air was both cold and warm, as if the building couldn\u2019t decide if it was a winter or a summer, as if it contained all seasons and you could choose. He watched people walk with the particular stiffness of travellers who are trying not to run. He handed the check-in woman the letter like a magic trick and watched her face change when she realized he wasn\u2019t lying. He took his boarding pass as if it were a fragile thing. He held it too tight. He loosened his grip. He told himself not to pee and then had to pee again. He left his mother at the glass where all the mothers stand and made his mouth into the shape that people make when they are trying not to make a sound. He walked through the body scanner and the machine was kind to him. He put his belt back on with fingers that had forgotten how to move.\n\nBefore boarding, he sat at a metal table and sent Bongani a voice note, because sometimes words typed are brittle. He told him he loved him. He told him to watch the show. He told him to tell the men at the garage that not all heroes wear oil stains. He looked up at the screen and saw the town he was leaving cast down in letters that looked too small for its size.\n\nHe lined up. He moved forward. He handed over the piece of paper again and then he put his foot onto the plane and felt the whole thing holding him in an old kind of way, like a hug you\u2019d been promised as a child and forgot to claim. He took his seat by the window because he had begged. He pressed his hand to the window and felt nothing, because cold has no intention. He watched the other passengers file past: a man with hair like a small animal; a woman with a baby who looked at him with the steady gaze of judgement; a teenager with headphones as big as the moon. He breathed and counted.\n\nHe closed his eyes for a second and saw the stage again, light moving the way water does. He opened them and the plane began to move. His stomach made the small jump. His heart followed. He didn\u2019t think of the white Quantum that sometimes idled by the spaza. He didn\u2019t think of the woman with the clipboard. He didn\u2019t think of anything that wasn\u2019t the lift of wheels, the tilt, the sudden realization that ground had been optional all along.\n\nSomewhere over emptiness, in that first strange dark when the world below is a soft rumor and the world within is too loud to be a friend, he took the elastic off his wrist to rub the mark it left. He held the goggles in his lap like a child with a toy he refuses to give up. He felt the plane bank and he felt an idea do the same. He fell asleep then, mouth slightly open, the way he hated to be seen, and dreamed of a city that greeted him in a language he almost knew, and a girl who asked him a question he couldn\u2019t quite hear, and someone humming unfortunately off-key in the seat behind him. He dreamed, too, that his phone was vibrating with a call he couldn\u2019t answer because his hands were covered in water and he didn\u2019t want to drip on the screen. He woke, sweating, and found a tear tacky on his cheek. He wiped it away and chose the sky again. He did not notice the small vibration that wasn\u2019t the plane, the one deep in the hollow of his shirt where he had put the phone, a vibration from a number he didn\u2019t know with a message that said: Welcome. Please make your way to the exit marked Staff when you arrive, for expedited processing. Reply YES to confirm. He didn\u2019t notice that he had replied in his sleep. He didn\u2019t notice that his wrist still bore the mark where the goggles had been. Some marks don\u2019t understand borders. Some marks are entire languages you carry under your skin.Chapter 3\n\nHe woke with a soft jerk that felt like being tugged back from a river you hadn\u2019t realized was already over your head. The cabin light had been turned low, the sort of low that suggested a morning was waiting outside where morning had no business being. He checked the oval of the window and saw nothing much at first, then the grey revealed itself, a grey with gradients he didn\u2019t have names for. The wing was there, tipped like a long blade, and below it a city that looked as if it had been ironed flat and then folded back up to make room for itself. He swallowed against the dry in his throat. He looked at the other passengers as if maybe one of them would catch his eye and say, yes man, you did it, welcome, but nobody did. A man across the aisle was already watching something on his phone, sound off, subtitles running, eyes steady. The baby two rows up had gone to sleep in the pose of a small dictator, mouth open, fists at shoulder height, intent on dreaming of issuing orders.\n\nThe wheels touched down and the plane sang its soft rubber song. People began to move before anyone told them they could, the human need to stand up triumphant over instruction. Kabelo unclipped his belt on the second sound of the chime because he liked to pretend he obeyed the world when he did not. He felt in his chest something like laughter that had not found its way to his mouth yet. He rubbed the ghost of the goggle elastic on his wrist and it itched the way a healed wound remembers where it is. The cold was different here; it came through the closed window and asked him if he was sure.\n\nWhen the doors opened, the plane breathed out its people and the airport breathed them in. He stepped into the corridor that was both tube and hallway, carpet too clean to admit shoes. The air smelled like cleaned air, like someone from the government had come with a bucket. He felt his eyes sting a little and pretended it was the recycled air and not his blood doing handstands again. He followed the signs that moved like a sentence: Arrivals, Baggage, Passport Control. Everyone\u2019s faces were focused on their own destinations, which was a relief. He carried his small bag like it was his job. He held his letter so it would be very ready. He felt brave and small in equal portions, like a man holding a match in a cave.\n\nHis phone buzzed in a way that made him look at it without meaning to. The message was there and the message was clean in its assumptions: Welcome. Please make your way to the exit marked Staff when you arrive, for expedited processing. Reply YES to confirm. He felt the yes already sent under his thumb like an offense committed by a stranger who shared his body. He blinked at it and for a second considered the delete as if erasure were a time machine, then saw, lower down, another message from the official address of the show, with the logo he had already memorized from the PDF. It said: Our coordinator will meet you at arrivals. Look for the blue lanyard and the sign with your name. He read both messages twice. His mother\u2019s voice did that thing on the inside of his ribs, the one where a laugh is holding hands with a warning. Boats with no engines. He looked up and the crowd was moving. He tucked the phone under his palm the way you hide a stone you plan to throw.\n\nThe line for Passport Control looked like a story about patience. People queued as if they had practiced it since infancy. He joined and watched the officers behind the glass, their faces serious delivered in identical expressions, haircuts like decisions. He held his letter so the page would catch the light just so. He had not moved more than a meter in five minutes when he saw a hand lift a sign beyond the barrier, a hand slender and purposeful, holding a rectangle with his name spelled correctly and the theatre\u2019s logo printed small but present in the corner. The hand belonged to a woman whose hair was the kind of straight that cost effort, and she had a lanyard the blue of a sky that lived in brochures. She looked over the heads as men in uniforms allowed her to be where she was. She caught his eye the way you catch a ball only you see. She lifted her eyebrows like a signal that could pass as question.\n\nHe stepped out of the line without saying sorry because the apology would have been to no one. He held up his letter not because he needed to but because he needed to do something with his hand. An officer with forearms that could have belonged to a wrestler moved a rope for him, and the woman stepped in and placed her palm on the small of his back in that way white cities let their functionaries touch you without asking. Her palm was warm, which surprised him in a country this grey.\n\n\u201cMr. Maseko,\u201d she said, and her voice carried the musical authority of someone who has learned to make vowels do heavy lifting. \u201cWelcome. We\u2019ll get you through the boring bits. How was your flight?\u201d She was smiling like a person whose job was to be the human version of a nod.\n\n\u201cIt had a lot of hours in it,\u201d he said, and her smile widened as if she had a quota of those.\n\n\u201cEleanor,\u201d she said, touching her lanyard. \u201cTalent coordination. We\u2019ve got a car waiting to take you straight to the hotel. Big day tomorrow.\u201d She moved, and he moved, and the officer merely looked at the lanyard as if the lanyard was a passport for its own country. He thought of the other message. He thought of the word staff and how staff was also a stick.\n\nThey took a corridor that did not advertise itself. It had the smell of carpet that has only known polite shoes, and the walls were an off-white that might disguise any kind of dirt if you begged it. Eleanor walked fast but not fast enough for him to fall behind, and her shoes made a sound like a small horse in a distant field. She waved at another person with a lanyard, and that one waved back. He watched the mouths of words on signs that said Restricted and Authorized and imagined the rooms hidden behind them where the city was a body with its skin turned inside out.\n\nAt a door with a badge reader, she put her pass to the black square, and the light went green like money. \u201cRight,\u201d she said, a word that here meant yes and here meant this way and here meant we\u2019re going to pretend none of this is strange. The officer at the next post looked at his passport and at the letter, checked the photo with a gaze so fast it could have been a blink, then stamped as if stamps were an extension of his hand. The stamp felt like an answer to a question he hadn\u2019t had to phrase.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll love London,\u201d Eleanor said, as they walked, and her breath made clouds when they came out to the bit where the air had the right to be cold. \u201cIt\u2019s cruel and beautiful in the same week. We keep all our weather in one day. We keep all our opinions under our coats.\u201d\n\nHe listened and looked and tried to match the rhythm of his steps to the new hum. The glass did not end. The high ceiling felt like a sky that had been domesticated. He thought of the Pretoria robot that liked to hesitate and then surrender. He thought of Auntie Mavis and her insistence on feeding him as if flight burned food faster than breath. He wanted to touch the floor to confirm it would hold him. He watched Eleanor\u2019s hair for the small plaster he had seen on another neck. There was no plaster. There was only a necklace a kind of gold that knew it was better than his eyes could afford.\n\nThe car was not a car you could imagine bumping over potholes. The man holding the door had a face like a closed cupboard and said his name with an economy that made respect sound expensive. The warm air inside smelled of something sweet and chemical, pine maybe, or the memory of pine. As they pulled away, the airport unfolded in a series of long limbs. Outside, London stood up from behind its railings, a city pretending to be shy.\n\nHe had expected to be underwhelmed. People came back and said the same thing in different words: the buildings are old but not that old, the sun makes promises it can\u2019t keep, the river is a brown ribbon that thinks it\u2019s silk. Instead, from the first curve of road he had the feeling that he had walked into a book that had been on the syllabus of his life. Terraced houses leaned into one another as if panicking about falling over alone. Trees were bare in a way Pretoria trees were rarely brave enough to be. Buses wore their red like a lipstick you put on to remind yourself you have a face.\n\n\u201cIs it as big as the TV says?\u201d he asked, half to make noise, half because he wanted to hear Eleanor talk a little more. She clicked her tongue once, an English click, light and amused.\n\n\u201cOn TV, everything\u2019s either smaller or bigger,\u201d she said. \u201cIn person, it\u2019s as big as you. It\u2019s exactly your size if you stand properly.\u201d\n\nHe thought of Mr. Lategan and his warning about the ice of television. He rolled his shoulders back as if training them already to resist their drop. He was acutely aware of the space in the car, the distance between his knees and the seat in front, like he had been upgraded in a life he hadn\u2019t paid for. He took his phone out to tell his mother that he was under almost-sky, and found the message thread again. He clicked the unknown number and watched the way it displayed itself. There was just that one instruction, then the automatic gratitude his finger had sent while he was dreaming of cities that hummed. He wrote back now because sometimes choosing words made a person feel like they were choosing their day.\n\nWho is this, he typed, and immediately regretted the lack of politeness. He added: Sorry, please who is this. It felt like an offering in a place where he did not yet have offerings to give.\n\n\u201cEverything alright?\u201d Eleanor asked, and he realized he had made a small sound without permission.\n\n\u201cJust the usual,\u201d he said. \u201cMy friend wants me to bring him biscuits that know their own mind.\u201d He said it so blandly that it could have been a translation error. She laughed because laughter was easier than asking.\n\nThey crossed a bridge and he could see the water then, the river doing its old-man shuffle, wide and not quite sure it needed to hurry. It had a colour that was in between, not mud exactly, not tea, a colour that deserved a better word than brown. He pressed his hand to the window and felt that same nothing that expensive cold gives. Eleanor followed his gaze and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll hear the river more than you\u2019ll smell it. It gives advice no one asked for.\u201d He wanted to say, water doesn\u2019t lie, but he filed it away because some truths needed to be introduced slowly to new cities.\n\nThe hotel they stopped at had a lobby that made him check his shoes for crimes. There were people sitting at little tables with drinks that looked like plans. A man in a suit too well-behaved to be comfortable asked his name and made a note and produced a key card like a magician hating his audience. Eleanor navigated the check-in process like a woman who had unfurled this dance a hundred times. She handed him an envelope with the show\u2019s logo peek-peeking and the weight of many instructions. He tucked it under his arm as if it might fly off if he didn\u2019t remind it who owned who.\n\n\u201cHave a nap,\u201d she said. \u201cCall sheet\u2019s in there. Tech rehearsal is tomorrow afternoon. We\u2019ve organized a pool for you this evening if you want to shake the travel out of your shoulders.\u201d She leaned in slightly. \u201cAnd listen, don\u2019t let anyone else manage you. There are a lot of\u2026 enthusiasts at this stage. People who\u2019ve discovered they love talent only when it\u2019s nearly crowned. Stick with the blue lanyards. Stick with me or Paul. Don\u2019t give your passport to anyone who sells you a smile.\u201d Her voice carried a different gravity at the end, and he thought of his mother and her boats, and of Auntie Mavis muttering about how they don\u2019t feed black people on planes even when they do.\n\nHe nodded. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry for that kind of thing,\u201d he said, and she tilted her head as if he had said something that required later unpacking.\n\nUpstairs, the room was both precise and generous. The bed looked like a flat ocean that had agreed to hold him up. There were little bottles in the bathroom that smelled like they had been invented to make a person remember they were a body. He put his bag on a chair that didn\u2019t squeak. He stood by the window and saw a sliver of the river between buildings like a secret being shared by strangers. He took off his shoes. He lay on the bed with his arms straight by his sides because he wanted to see what it felt like to surrender without falling.\n\nHe did not sleep because sleeping would make time move badly. He opened the envelope and made his eyes behave. There it all was, neat as a row of clips: rehearsal time, audition stage cues, contact numbers, an emergency card that advised him to present it to any official if anyone told him to change his plan. There was a laminated backstage pass with his picture not yet there, a space waiting for his face as if the plastic were a mouth about to speak his name. There was a voucher for a meal in the hotel restaurant that threatened to turn food into theatre. There was a map with an arrow to the pool, the pool with a name that sounded like a man from a Charles Dickens book had built it.\n\nHe sent his mother a voice note anyway because paper was too cold for certain declarations. \u201cKe fihlile,\u201d he said softly, then in English for her pleasure at the turn of his tongue. \u201cI arrived. It\u2019s big. I didn\u2019t freeze. There\u2019s a lady with hair like a law and she\u2019s looking after me. The river is like an animal. I will call again later. Rest now. Tell Auntie Mavis I have eaten, even if I haven\u2019t, so she stops fighting the plane in her mind.\u201d He listened back to his own voice before sending it, a habit he hated because it made him feel like a man arguing with his echoes.\n\nHis phone blinked and the unknown number blinked with it. We facilitate, the reply read. Your reply is enough. Proceed with trust. He frowned because the sentence had something in it that his ear didn\u2019t like. It wasn\u2019t wrong, but it wasn\u2019t right either. He typed back: Is this from the show. There was no read receipt, only the calm flatness of delivered. A moment later a different message arrived from the official coordinator account: Don\u2019t forget your briefing at 5 PM. Pool reserved from 7 to 8 PM at Ironmonger Row. Please bring cap and goggles; lifeguard provided. It did not have room for a we facilitate anywhere.\n\nHe pulled the elastic out of his pocket as if it could vote. He rolled it between finger and thumb and thought of the woman with the clipboard on the grass at home. He pictured again the plaster on the neck, the way it had looked stuck there like a tiny flag of belonging. He shook his head because the room had too much silence for his brain to be allowed to invent extras. He set an alarm, then another because he could not yet trust this city to remember him. He showered too long, and the hot water ran down his legs and made him feel like London might be forgiven if only for how it could do steam.\n\nHe went downstairs early for the briefing because wrong is often found in lateness. The room they used was called a suite which seemed rude to normal rooms. There were already other people there, filling chairs with their particularities. A man with hair that stuck up as if his hand had been static for a year sat with his eyes closed and his mouth moving as if he were praying an audio book. A pair of twins wearing jackets with sequins mapping unnamed constellations flanked a woman in a wheelchair with a mouth full of jokes she hadn\u2019t told yet. A kid who could not be old enough to have finished grade eight twitched his fingers as if playing a piano only he could see. He breathed easier at the sight of them because there is a particular mercy in being among the weird ones and knowing you are part of their weather.\n\nPaul came in and clapped once and asked them to please not be trouble. He had a clipboard so full it might as well have been a way of saying sorry. He did the quick orientation, the jokes that dissolved any bubbles of frightening silence. He said backstage was both smaller and larger than it looked on TV, which was a philosophical statement hiding in a logistical announcement. He told them who to text if they needed to cry. He reminded them to say yes to all the applause and no to any contracts handed out in hallways that smelled like coffee and ambition.\n\nKabelo watched the way Paul spoke with his whole neck, veins doing other jobs. He watched the room watch him and knew that this ritual had been designed not merely to inform but to soften the edges of the future\u2019s teeth. He nodded at appropriate moments. He said his name when asked and it sounded thinner than at home, like the air had taken a sip of it before returning it to him. He laughed when the others laughed and took notes that were more pictures than words: a square for the stage, a scribble for the river, a rectangle for the pool like a promise he could put between his ribs.\n\nIronmonger Row Baths was not far and yet the way there felt long because turning a city into a map takes time and you always misplace an inch somewhere. He walked because walking taught him faster, and because the light stayed low but stubborn, like a man who has decided not to sit. He passed a shop that sold newspapers no one wanted to touch anymore and a man selling chestnuts from a cart that looked like it had waited under a bridge all summer for this job. The smell was a thing to apologize to; his stomach remembered its role. The pavement held the day\u2019s wet from a drizzle that looked like an argument the sky wasn\u2019t sure about. Cyclists ghosted past on bikes that hummed the sound of hazard.\n\nThe baths themselves sat stubbornly, brick and earnest. The tiles inside made the world into geometry and the women at reception operated the till and the door with a choreography that predated his arrival by decades. He showed the laminated card and the lifeguard on duty, a man with hair the color of toast and a jaw like a chopping board, lifted his chin in greeting and managed not to be bored when he said, \u201cYou\u2019re the telly one.\u201d He said the words telly one with equal parts amusement and solidarity, like having been on television was a sort of cold they all recognized.\n\nThe pool was warmer than he had expected, and the water had a texture different to the one children in Pretoria left behind on him. He slid in and the pool threw its arms around him with the enthusiasm of a dog who has learned your name. He let his body guess at distances and guessed right within three strokes. The tiles moved under him, blue and white and serious. He sank and held and felt the world narrow the way he needed the world to narrow. He could see the lifeguard\u2019s legs from below, planted, a tree on land he could reach if he chose. He did a length with his eyes closed because sometimes trust is a muscle and then opened them and found himself facing a face at the glass, a pale oval with fog around it, a figure on the other side of the viewing window where people sat to watch their people fail to drown.\n\nShe was a woman, or the idea of a woman, wearing a coat with a belt tied too tightly as if that would hold her inside her outline. She had a notebook in her hand and something on her neck that might have been a scarf or might have been nothing at all. He blinked his goggles clear and she was scribbling, and when she looked up she had the practiced glance-away of someone who knows that looking is a declaration. He swam a second length and a third, and the fourth he slowed and spun and came up halfway just to breathe and see, and the window was empty and the bench behind it held only a towel with a picture of a dolphin pretending to be a fish.\n\nThat night in the hotel he ate the meal voucher allowed him and it tasted like all hotels in all cities: a careful flavoring of comfort and control. He called his mother and listened to the familiar rustle of their house as her voice tried on its brave. She told him that the neighbor\u2019s dog had sat on their stoep all afternoon and that meant luck if you believed in the right things. He told her he had swum in water that belonged to other people, and she said, \u201cWater belongs only to God,\u201d with the correctedness of a woman who has seen taps fail and thinks of rivers as people. He didn\u2019t tell her about the message that said we facilitate because it would only have made her see boats in doors. He told her about the chestnuts and how the city burned small things to make big smells, and she laughed and said, \u201cDon\u2019t put that idea into Bongani\u2019s head, he\u2019ll burn the garage and tell me it\u2019s dinner.\u201d\n\nWhen he hung up he sat by the window until his breath made his reflection blur and the river held its line like an older lane rope gone brown with use. He scrolled again, because to scroll late at night is to volunteer your brain for extra shifts. He watched videos of the final stage, the lighting design that made ordinary sparkle like a scandal. He watched how men walked the stage before they performed, the way their shoulders admitted to the weight they had applied to them. He watched a clip of a swimmer from years before, a woman whose routine was less water and more performance art, how she had brought a transparent tank onto the stage and turned breath into a geometry problem everyone solved with their hands over their mouths. The comments under the video were a terrible argument about what counted as talent and what counted as a dare. He closed the app because people who sit in their houses and invent unkindness should not be given the speed of his blood.\n\nThe unknown number wrote once more, very late, as if it had waited for him to get soft. Reminder, it said. Staff exit tomorrow at stage door. Avoid public entrance. Wear jacket with hood. Avoid identifying markers. We will shepherd. He stared at the words and his hands felt too clean. He could hear Mr. Lategan\u2019s voice saying simple is shiny and shiny is simple and you are\u2014 and the blank long and full. He thought of Eleanor and her hair and the blue lanyard that got doors to behave. He wrote back: I have blue lanyard people. Please confirm your names. The gap between his message and any answer stretched like gum. He put the phone face down on the bedside table and the room took a breath he had not given it permission for.\n\nHe brushed his teeth and the water from the tap ran clear and efficiently, and he thought of how water in Pretoria sometimes coughed and then apologized with a hiss. He undressed and climbed into the hotel bed that had been designed to erase the outline of who you were before you lay down. He turned off the light and kept his eyes open long enough to edit the stage in his head until it fit his body. His last thought before the day let go was a small and stubborn one, not the sort of cinematic thought he might have chosen if he were writing his own scene. It was this: do not drown in other people\u2019s systems. It carried him into sleep like a current that knew what it was doing.Chapter 4\n\nMorning arrived sideways, a shy animal nosing at the curtains, and Kabelo\u2019s first thought was that London light had learned its manners from church. It entered without demanding rooms rearrange themselves. He lay very still and listened to the hum the building made, the way the air conditioner swallowed and released, the way distant pipes cleared their throats, the thin far-off roll of a suitcase wheel along carpet. He tested his body in small ways. Ankles flexed, hands opened and closed, shoulder blades pulled together to see if the left would sulk as Mr. Lategan had accused. Nothing hurt that wouldn\u2019t be soothed by water. He reached for his phone, and it showed him a time that didn\u2019t know or care about Pretoria. He looked at the river slice of view and told himself to learn the city in units he understood: breaths, turns, steps between door and stairs. In a country where the weather talked first, he would have to answer properly or risk being considered rude by the sky.\n\nIn the breakfast room, plates made the same noises plates make in any city that prides itself on being the center of its own map. People put food on their dishes as if the day needed an introduction ceremony. A waitress with a ponytail that had negotiated a peace treaty with gravity poured him coffee and called him love without asking permission, and he tried the word on from the inside like a borrowed jacket. He ate eggs that had never seen home oil and bread that cut his gums in a way that made him think of seriousness. He thought of Auntie Mavis\u2019s bowl with the stew that refused to be merely itself, and smiled over his plate like a man with secrets too domestic to be interesting to anyone else. His phone trembled politely on the table; there was a message from Paul reminding him of the hair-and-mic unit at eleven, a short slot with a camera at noon to capture his hands doing things like holding a cup, a technical at two where the stage would pretend to be generous. It calmed him to see the day printed like that, logistics acting as rope. He swallowed another mouthful and told himself he could choose when to be nervous, as if the animal of fear were polite enough to wait outside until invited.\n\nHe walked to the theatre even though a car had been offered, because cities filtered better through soles. He learned the crossings and their patience. He learned that cyclists here said sorry with their shoulders and buses asked for space with their bulk and not their voices. He crossed a small square where pigeons negotiated territory without needing borders drawn, and he stood for a second to watch two men argue softly about a painting in a shop window neither would ever buy. The theatre revealed itself the way theatres do, less as a building than as a notion: arches decorated by someone who believed in curves, doors that expected to be opened with intention, posters pretending the future had already arrived and had stars to show for it. He touched the doorframe as he entered the way he touched the starting block before he sent himself forward at the pool, as if saying hello to a thing with edges could soften it.\n\nBackstage had its own weather. The air was warm from bodies pretending to be calm. The floor wanted to trip you if you didn\u2019t consider it. People introduced themselves and their roles as if reading from a list they were proud of: Stage manager, floor manager, sound, camera two, runner, runner again, runner with more seniority. A woman with a headset and a mouth that had practiced efficient smiles ushered him to a corner where a camera waited to look at him like a person meeting a dog they might adopt. They asked him to hold a mug as if it were very important, to look out a window with his jaw angled like a question, to walk down a corridor once, then twice, then once more with less of his mouth. They asked him how water found him, and he said a sentence that sounded right while leaving out the parts that were not theirs to hold: that he loved the way silence formed around breath, that he liked a stage where audiences couldn\u2019t decide if they wanted to clap or hold their chests, that pools were a kind of church in places where the churches got tired. They asked about Pretoria and he gave them the morning birds and the robot that liked to reconsider its choices, and he did not give them the white Quantum outside the spaza or the woman with the clipboard who might have been no one. This sort of storytelling needed the shape of a bowl it would not spill from.\n\nEleanor appeared with her lanyard as if she had risen out of the building, and she made a little spiral in the air with her finger which translated cleanly to follow me, we\u2019re changing rooms. He went, because following was easier than pretending to be his own map in a house that had already decided its hallways. In the smaller room they called green without either grass or envy, she spoke in a tone that sat in the middle of the scale. \u201cSecurity wants to brief you on small things,\u201d she said, and her eyes flicked like someone reading a note without wanting to show it. \u201cNot because you\u2019re in danger. Because London collects people when it can.\u201d She waited for him to nod and then added as if tossing a coin, \u201cShow me anything odd you get on your phone. People are\u2026 enthusiastic, and some of them are not the kind of fans who clap in public.\u201d Her smile had written across it the word please.\n\nHe unlocked the thread with the unknown number and handed it over. She read and made the kind of noise you make for a fly near your ear. She thumbed something into her own phone with the determination of a woman telling a toaster not to burn the next round. \u201cNot ours,\u201d she said. \u201cNot any of the production partners we trust. We had an issue last year with a man who called himself an agent and turned out to be a bus with no brakes. If you get any instructions not signed by me or Paul or the senior stage managers, you delete them and then send them to me like you\u2019ve sent these. If someone in a corridor says they can get you better light, you agree with them and keep walking.\u201d She looked up, satisfied with a small plan. \u201cAlso there is a very boring sandwich for you, for later, in the fridge in your dressing room. Eat it before you get too brave and forget your head is attached to a body.\u201d\n\nThe technical rehearsal was a machine doing an impression of chaos while actually being a ballet. He stood on the black that ate sound and watched the lights argue their way into a compromise the lighting director could tolerate. The plexi tank had been rolled into position by men with arms that had done this a hundred times for acts that needed boxes, cages, rooms within rooms. It stood there, an aquarium without fish, waiting to be domesticated by his oxygen. He placed his hand flat against it and felt the cold travel into him. He did not perform properly; nobody allowed that. He measured. He counted steps from wing to mark, counted the seconds for the crew to wheel the tank to its kiss with the downstage line, counted the beats it would take for the camera to settle in the right eye. He sat on the rim for a minute and looked up into the rafters where metal held more metal, and he considered how even the wires had to have faith.\n\nThey talked through safety with the seriousness of hospital corridors. A man named Ross, whose hands had a surgeon\u2019s care for clamps and clips, showed him the quick-release on the tank lid. He showed him the sign that would mean stop now, and the other sign that would mean carry on because television required this risk to look like a choice. A medic with plasters like a magician\u2019s deck briefed him on the signs of blood sugar dropping and the taste of panic in the back of the throat. He nodded and repeated back the numbers because repetition was how you teach fear to sit on the step and wait. He slipped into the water, just for a moment, just to hear the sound it made when it agreed. The crew watched him in the way men watch someone handling something sharp; eyes alert, jaws ready to clench. He dipped under and rose and shook water from his cap like a dog pretending not to be ridiculous. Somewhere high in the darkness, a woman\u2019s shape leaned to whisper to someone else, the traitor echo of a clipboard tapping a thigh.\n\nIn the green room later, the cameras returned for their second bite. A producer whose mouth did sincerity like a sport asked him gently if there was anything about his father he wanted to say on camera. He considered saying no the way you consider running a red light when the road is empty and you are late. He said something that was both true and not. He said his father had taught him that not everything that leaves is lost. He said he had learned to forgive people he had not yet met. He did not talk about the bridge over the Apies River and the way the flood had looked like a procession. The producer nodded as if the shape of the sentence would be the same, regardless of the words, once it was put through television\u2019s patient factory.\n\nIt was only as he left the room to pee that he saw the woman again. A flash of coat, the belt cinched like someone who believed in keeping things in place. She stood near the stage door, not on it, in the zone where smokers earned their lungs their trouble. She had a lanyard tucked inside her collar as if it were shyer than she was. She looked up when he looked over and there was the practiced angle-away, the we-weren\u2019t-looking even while we were. Her neck, exposed as she turned, bore that small square of something\u2014the edge of adhesive, the shape familiar like the plasters they stuck on children after injections. He told himself it was the wrong distance to be anything but coincidence, and the word coincidence hurt more than he wanted to admit. He washed his hands a little too long and told his face not to give secrets to the mirror.\n\nPaul found him again with a look that was the cousin of hurry. He made the group of them\u2014twins, boy with invisible piano, woman in the wheelchair whose jokes were starting to filter into the air like incense\u2014stand in a loose circle while he distributed the kind of warnings that sounded like a chorus by the second time you heard them. \u201cEat something easy. No trying new foods during show week unless you want new results from your stomach,\u201d he said, wagging his clipboard. \u201cNo disappearing. No deciding you suddenly trust strangers. Your family members must come through the public entrance with tickets like everyone else; do not hand anyone your pass unless you are fine with finding yourself outside in a city that enjoys the taste of lost people. There will be press at the front door. If you don\u2019t want to talk to them, you don\u2019t have to, and if you do, remember you belong to yourself even when a microphone is under your mouth.\u201d He paused and the pause was a kind of respect. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m extremely fond of you already and want you all to be boring for the next forty-eight hours.\u201d He made them laugh and sent them away to their rooms and their small private rituals.\n\nThe afternoon bent itself into the shape of something survivable. He lay on the dressing room floor and breathed at the ceiling because sometimes breathing needed a view. He stretched the places that forgot they were muscles during travel. He wrote the call times on his palm because he trusted his hand more than he trusted his memory and because the ink\u2019s sting gave his skin a job to do. He ate half the boring sandwich and then the other half because duty has its own hunger. He texted Bongani a picture of his feet in socks that carried the hotel\u2019s name like a secret, and Bongani replied with a picture of the garage dog sleeping under a car with its nose in a pool of shade. He rang his mother and listened to her say his name as if it were an instruction to the air to be kinder. She told him she had bought a sack of oranges and that was luck if you believed in circles. He told her that the city wore its buildings like a coat it refused to take off even indoors. They talked about nothing the way people do when everything is standing outside the door pretending not to listen.\n\nAt seven, Ironmonger Row welcomed him again, stubborn and tiled. The lifeguard nodded and set his jaw to the particular geometry of a man who takes this as a job and a prayer. The water picked up where it had left off. He worked the Serpent until his lungs sang the warning hymns and then he worked it once more for the sake of disobedience. He counted six beats longer than his average and felt the little bloom of pride he would not feed too much in case it turned feral. On his next set, he felt it then: a pressure that wasn\u2019t water. He looked toward the window and saw, not the woman this time, but a man sitting like a coat on the bench, legs crossed at the knee, reading a newspaper as if newspapers still specialized in truth. He had that same not-looking, the attention that flits away in order to be less suspicious when it returns. Kabelo looked away deliberately and the chlorinated light broke itself into pieces against the surface as if nothing at all had happened. He finished his laps and then a few more because sometimes \u201cmore\u201d was the only prayer you could remember.\n\nBack in the hotel corridor, outside his door, a small envelope had been placed with the rectangular humility of hotel paper. His name was written in a hand that tried for neatness and only just made it. He took it inside and opened it not on instinct but because this was a place where other people\u2019s hands had too much practice. Inside, a generic welcome note from the hotel and a card for additional spa services lay as expected, and behind it, folded neatly as a second thought, a single square of plaster with the corner slightly turned, the adhesive dull from too much air. He put it down on the table as if it were a living thing and the table had a heart that might startle. He breathed out and felt the paper of his lungs.\n\nHe dialed reception and asked, in the voice of a man who was practicing being ordinary, whether there had been any mail for room whatever-his-number-was. The woman on the phone said no, dear, nothing that we didn\u2019t give you at check-in. He said thank you like a man in a play. He called Eleanor and reached voicemail and left a message which said only, \u201cCall me when you can, small thing,\u201d and he hated the way the word small made the world want to prove him wrong. The unknown number pinged and his skin did what it had learned to do: become an ear. Reminder: Staff exit tomorrow at stage door. Avoid the crowd. We will shepherd. The punctuation was organized and the tone had the blandness of someone who has told many people what to do and enjoys being obeyed. He took a photo of the message and sent it to Eleanor, and then he placed the phone face down again like he had the night before, as if the screen might start marketing trouble through light.\n\nIt was only when he was brushing his teeth, the hotel mirror turning him into a man who could be anyone, that there was a knock at the door. It was the knock hotels encourage: polite, two taps, the assumption of a person with towels. He paused with the brush in his mouth in the unflattering pose of people in bathrooms. The knock repeated itself with no extra information. He went to the door and looked through the peephole and saw nothing except the distorted suggestion of something that could have been a sleeve. \u201cYes?\u201d he asked in a voice he tried to keep in the key of unbothered. A small beat of silence. Then a woman\u2019s voice, the kind English had when it prepared itself for public spaces. \u201cEvening. Turn-down service.\u201d He took his hand off the knob and placed it against the door instead, feeling the small thud of his own pulse through wood. \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d he said, and waited. A breath. \u201cOf course,\u201d the voice said, and then footsteps arranged themselves in the corridor and went away. He stood there two minutes, counting, because counting was what he had left over.\n\nHe did not sleep so much as visit the idea of sleep and then apologize for leaving early. Dreams did their loud thing and he kept waking with the impression of faces pressed close to glass, of plasters peeled and reapplied like a password on skin. He got up before his alarm and did push-ups between the bed and the wardrobe until his arms shook with gratitude for a simple instruction. He drank water he didn\u2019t want because his body would need it to hold its breath and still want to live. He watched the light do its pale stretching and told himself again that the day needed legs he could trust.\n\nCall time pulled him into the building like a pocket being turned inside out. He let makeup do the small kindnesses it could, dulling the afternoon out of his skin and convincing the camera he was made of one piece. A woman wired him with a mic he would not wear for the performance because water and electronics have never made friends; it was for corridor interviews, footholds for a story someone would craft later to suit airtime and appetite. Producers came and went with clipboards like birds pretending to be heavy. The hosts appeared in their way, the one with eyes that could sell everything and nothing, the other with a grin that made old women decide to forgive the whole country for stealing biscuits. They clasped his shoulder, asked a joke that had traveled from another day and still kept warmth, and confirmed the pronunciation of his name with care that surprised him. He nodded and nodded and told himself that doing this was part of doing what he loved, that some stages come attached to tunnels.\n\nHe did not walk to the stage door. He stood by the kettle and drank a paper cup of water that tasted faintly of previous paper cups. He glanced at his phone and found it lit up like a face that had learned smiling as a defense. A final message from the unknown: Here. Now. Hood up. We will meet you in three breaths. He read it twice and his jaw arranged itself into a thing that kept him from saying what his mouth wanted to say. He forwarded it to Eleanor without commentary because some commentary adds noise to fires. Then he blocked the number because sometimes power is a finger you remember you have. He put the phone on airplane mode for thirty seconds to make it understand what quiet was for and then put it back on the world.\n\nEleanor appeared almost immediately, moving with the speed of someone who remembers they have legs only when they need them. She had a man with her who looked like a bodyguard only if bodyguards were paid in boredom; his eyes took in corners and turned his head as if that required introducing one part of himself to another. \u201cYou stick to us today,\u201d she said, and the sentence did not leave room for other hobbies. \u201cIf anyone tells you I told you to meet them, you bring them to me so I can meet my alleged errand.\u201d She touched his arm with the economy of a conductor tapping a stand. \u201cYou doing alright?\u201d He smiled because it was a tool. \u201cI\u2019m the right size for today,\u201d he said, and she rewarded him with a breath that might later decide to be a laugh.\n\nThey called five minutes in the way only theatres can, with the word five meaning it will be as long or short as it takes to be five. He stood in the wing with a towel over his shoulders that pretended to be ordinary. The plexi tank gleamed its cold invitation. The stage manager asked him if he was ready, which would be comical in any other building. He put his palm flat to the tank once, twice, as if checking a heartbeat. He rolled his neck with the guilty pleasure of a man who knows his body will obey. He thought of Pretoria mornings with their accusations and their dinosaur birds, of the robot that could not decide and the woman with the mop who turned cleaning into a chord. He thought of his mother in her pink scarf, of Auntie Mavis fighting airplanes with stew, of Bongani reading prophecies in oil stains. He thought of the Apies River swelling its dark chest and of how water keeps its own diary whether or not you ask to read it. He put the goggle elastic on his wrist for the walk to mark and then pulled the goggles up when the music and the light and the room agreed to begin.\n\nHe stepped into the light and it warmed him, and for a second London ceased to be a collection of opinions and became simply a temperature. The audience moved like a weather system, a murmur that rose and fell. He placed his hands on the rim of the tank and felt the cold insist one more time on its character. He breathed and counted, the old contractions of lungs that had learned to find room in the small places. He glanced into the first row because he had told himself he would, just once, to prove he could and then not again. Faces presented themselves like fruit in a market: glossy, watchful, hungry, bored. He looked past them without knowing he had, and his gaze landed for a sliver on a man standing by the exit in a jacket with a hood that shadowed his mouth. The man was looking not at the stage but at the crew, at the door, measuring, his head moving in those shallow arcs that don\u2019t want to be called nods. Kabelo placed the picture in his pocket along with all the other pictures and folded it small.\n\nHe lowered himself into the water and the sound inside took him by the jaw the way a mother does when she needs you to listen. The lid closed and the world narrowed in the precise way the world should when you choose it. He was barrel and blood and a creature evolved by his own insistence. He heard, distantly and correctly, the music being what he told it to be, not the sort they played on the radio, the private symphony you needed to learn by doing. He pressed his palms to the glass and imagined it was skin that had learned to be hard for a reason. He counted. He did the Serpent slow, then quicker, then still. He lifted himself inside the rectangle like a man praying with every part of his body at once. He felt the old urgency arrive in manageable packets, and he attended to them like parcels, stacking, storing, returning. He rose and the room made the sound that human throats make when they want to swallow all the air at once. He dropped again, later, and later again, and somewhere in his measuring he understood that the danger today would not be drowning but being kept too long by a system that believed it could own breath if it bought enough lights.\n\nWhen it was done\u2014no music, only the soft metal whirr of the lid\u2019s latch released\u2014he came up and the lights had decided to be kind. He blinked water out of eyelashes that had done their work and he heard a judge saying something with sonorous pleasure, syllables that would later be repeated back to him by people who wanted to speak the day into their kitchen tiles. He did not listen because listening would break the small altar he had built in his ribs. He looked down along the wing where the stage manager stood with hand poised above his headset mic, the signal for whether the floor crew should go or stay, and beyond him, in the seam between two curtains, a sliver of daylight from a door that had not been shut as well as it thought. A face in the seam, anonymized by hood, a breath fogging in the colder air beyond. He lifted his hand as if to wave to a friend. He waved to himself instead, the version of him who had no blue lanyard, no practice at saying no in new cities, who might have thought a staff door was just a door staff used. He looked once toward the wings and in that looking decided to be bored exactly as Paul had asked.\n\nThey rolled the tank away and he stood on the tape that said where he should be while the hosts came and a microphone turned a question into an offering. He answered in the small smiling sentences a man practices while looking at a bathroom mirror that holds his morning breath. \u201cWater doesn\u2019t lie,\u201d he said for the cameras because the sentence had taken an oath before he was born, and the crowd made the noise crowds make when they are given a sentence they can take home. He asked for nothing from them and received more than he could carry in his hands. He looked for Eleanor in the corner of his eye and found her, solid as a translation you trust, her clipboard held like a shield she\u2019d happily use. He saw the hooded man at the seam slide away, absorbed into the building\u2019s lungs. He exhaled and felt the fine print of the day settle on his shoulders and then roll off, silk or water or something invented between them.\n\nBack in the corridor condensed from congratulations and sweat, he let himself be steered because sometimes survival is letting the right people choose you. A young runner with eyebrows too honest to lie gave him his towel and he leaned his face into it not to hide but to remind himself that cloth was still a thing, that not all surfaces were glass and light. Someone put tea into his hand and someone else took away a question before it reached him. He sat for a minute on a low flight case and felt the dull throb along his left shoulder where Mr. Lategan had accused it of betrayal. He rotated it and promised it work and rest. The phone, which he had left on silent as if it were a child and he a bad father, showed him a hill of messages: his mother\u2019s voice so full it sounded like music, Bongani\u2019s shout over men pretending to be quiet at the garage, Auntie Mavis\u2019s short note that said, simply, \u201cWe are clapping,\u201d as if the clapping had been assigned to their house and they had done their part. The unknown thread was silent, its mouth a flat line.\n\nHe closed his eyes for the length of a breath and saw Pretoria as if the city had come to sit on the edge of his bed and watch him sleep. He saw the jacaranda that had not yet permitted itself to flower and he saw the white Quantum napping by the spaza shop and he saw the kid with the flat ball hoping that the wall would one day answer back. He saw water, the way it wore every city with equal indifference and equal love. He opened his eyes to the corridor with all its noise and recognized it as a different kind of river, one that insisted you keep your elbows in when you passed through. He stood and let the day attach its practicalities to him, and he thought of what the medic had said about sugar and the taste of panic, and he tasted nothing but salt and the metallic tang of lights.\n\nBetween interviews he found Eleanor\u2019s eye and she made space around him the way a dog will turn its body to keep rain off a child\u2019s face. \u201cWe\u2019re going together to the cars,\u201d she said, the sentence small and complete. \u201cThere\u2019s been an attempt to collect at the loading bay. We\u2019re asked to vary exits. I\u2019ll bore you with corridors.\u201d He laughed, not because it was funny, but because laughter was a key you could use if you made it when the lock wasn\u2019t expecting you. People think danger announces itself like a drum. Sometimes it comes as a request written in professional grammar with a full stop in exactly the right place.\n\nThey walked a path through the building that seemed designed by someone who loved corners. They passed a room where sequins were having a conversation with bad lighting. They passed a stairwell that smelled like other people\u2019s cigarettes from other shows. They passed a door marked Plant in a font that had not seen sunlight since someone last changed bulbs. The blue lanyards had formed a kind of creek for them to float down. At the last turn before the car park, he looked back once in that unfashionable way people do who know their backs are not eyes, and in the long corridor, under the throat of a strip light that flickered in a way that suggested a maintenance budget, he saw a man standing very still, hands in pockets, face in that hood\u2019s careful hood. The man did not move, but his stillness carried decision. Kabelo placed the image into his pocket without unfolding it and walked into the cold that had rehearsed itself for this hour.\n\nOutside, the cars waited in their correct line, the drivers with their closed-cupboard faces and names spoken in polite syllables. London exhaled mist into everyone's hair. The building made a noise like a ship agreeing with itself. Eleanor put her hand on the small of his back again and it felt like someone closing a gate gently to keep the goats in and the wolves out. He ducked into the car and the seat took him as if it had not been recruited that morning to this exact job. He glanced at the glass and got instead his own face layered with the building\u2019s bare brick and the river of traffic beyond. He laughed too softly for anyone else to hear. He thought of the message he sent to himself before sleeping the night before and let it bloom, not as an order this time but as a promise with an oar: do not drown in other people\u2019s systems. He breathed like a man who had held onto something and found it holding him back with equal kindness. He breathed and gave the driver the address printed bold on the hotel card, not because the driver needed it, but because saying where you\u2019re going out loud sometimes persuades the world to agree.Chapter 6\n\nOn the morning the city remembered its summer and then thought better of it, the birds along Nelson Mandela Drive began their old argument as if they had forgotten how it ended, and Kabelo\u2019s mother woke with her hands already busy. She had fall-back prayers that required both palms to be flat on the table and her eyes to go narrow like she was aiming, and she had lists that didn\u2019t care that paper had always been poor. She made tea too strong for her own preference and stirred it as if strength could be transferred by spoon. The TV sat with its face turned toward the couch in that suggestive way that televisions have, a reminder that you could be watched by your own furniture if you misbehaved. News clips had found him, the show had found him, and now the house had a new draft that came under the door with the neighbors\u2019 curiosity. On the screen, when they ran the piece again between a politician apologizing without using any words and a weather map that turned the country into a bruise, there he was: her boy in a silver that could count as blue, inside a rectangle that looked too small for breath. The camera loved him because cameras love anyone who fights a thing and smiles after. She pressed her finger to the screen very lightly, as if blessing and scolding at once.\n\nAuntie Mavis arrived with the energy of an election. Her mouth came through the door before her hips, then her laugh like a borrowed trumpet. \u201cHe made me cry,\u201d she announced, not bothering with hello. \u201cAnd you know I don\u2019t cry for other people\u2019s children unless they die or marry wrong.\u201d She sat, then stood, then sat again, the body choosing moods the mind hadn\u2019t authorized. She pulled a newspaper out of a plastic bag like a magician finding a dove under a handkerchief. The headline did not have him by name but pretended to, as if fame were a shared surname. It had a grainy still of a man underwater that could have been a metaphor for government if they wanted to stretch.\n\n\u201cThey are saying he\u2019s a champion of breath,\u201d she said, reading, always surprising with the accuracy of a woman the world had tried and failed to keep illiterate. \u201cHah. As if he invented lungs.\u201d She peered around for the remote, found it, pointed it at the world, and then turned the volume low enough to make the moving mouths seem like a silent rehearsal for a life they would live later. \u201cWe will go to the shops today,\u201d she added, without transition. \u201cI will let people greet me like I am clever.\u201d She sucked her teeth and then remembered to be soft. \u201cYou slept?\u201d she asked the mother, and the mother shook her head and then tilted it as if to say, it\u2019s alright; I danced with fear and we\u2019re both tired now.\n\nBy nine there had been four calls offering to pray a blessing that came with a fee, two men in long shirts who introduced themselves as elders of a church that didn\u2019t exist on their street last week, a woman who claimed to be from a magazine that only printed black people if they were standing next to white ones. The elders smiled with their teeth and their hands did that thing of floating just ahead of their bodies, an attempt to touch the air near your shoulder without being accused of touching. \u201cWe are here for security in the spiritual,\u201d one said, and the mother smiled the way a person smiles at a dog who is trying to get into the yard from under the gate. \u201cWe have very good locks,\u201d she said, \u201cand we know how to use them.\u201d She closed the door and leaned back against it because leaning can be a weapon too.\n\nBongani phoned between pumping petrol for a man who wanted his tank to be full but not too full because he didn\u2019t trust the way gauges smiled. The line came through syrupy, as if the towers had decided to chew before they swallowed. \u201cHe was slick,\u201d he said, jumping straight to the music without instruments. \u201cCame to the garage in a jacket that thinks it\u2019s a season. Said he could get me to the UK in time to see the boy\u2019s next show, said family is important to narrative. Imagine telling me about narrative with hair like a stolen cat. I told him my passport is jealous of me and doesn\u2019t leave the house when I\u2019m not there. He laughed with only one side of his face. One of those laughs that took classes. He had a plaster on his neck, like he put a sticker there and forgot it. I saw it and I thought of something I shouldn\u2019t think and then he saw me see it and his laugh lost the little practice it had.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaibo,\u201d the mother said, a sound that was both prayer and swear. \u201cYou tell the garage men if they see that jacket again they must keep him busy with questions about soccer and wait for me to fetch a broom.\u201d\n\nBongani snorted because he had seen her with a broom when the neighbor\u2019s goat had tried to eat her washing and it had been a biblical lesson on boundaries. \u201cI told him,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat if he wants to meet our Mr. London he can watch him on the TV like the rest of us. He said TV is for people who haven\u2019t learned to be real. I said and yet here you are dressed like a flat screen.\u201d He made a little satisfied sound. \u201cThen he went away like milk at the end of the month.\u201d\n\nAfter he hung up, the mother picked up the old Nokia that still lived in the kitchen for emergencies, the one with the battery that refused to learn the meaning of tired, and typed out a message to her son that was both long and short: I saw you. Don\u2019t talk to doors you don\u2019t know. London has many of them. Eat something that remembers a pot. I am listening to the river on the TV. She sent it knowing he would be asleep or busy with people who would think their hands were important enough to hold his decisions. She went to the sink and held her own hands under the tap until the water changed temperature and finally told the truth.\n\nAt the theatre across an ocean, the day had decided to be busy. It busied the corridor, it busied the rehearsal schedules, it busied the small coffee machine until it sighed with martyrdom and then kept going. The show had made a decision about him that did not ask his permission: it would use his face for a particular shade of poster, it would interview him while he tied his shoes because they liked the line of an ankle, it would cut and paste his sentences until they lay flat and behaved. He let it, up to a point, because letting a thing can also be a strategy. He discovered he could step out of his body in tiny, legal ways: he could let them powder his cheekbone until it forgot about its own oil; he could stand at mark and let them circle him with cameras that hummed the hymns of their own gods; he could breathe deeper in the two seconds before he said a name so that the name came out with more authority than the name deserved. He held in his pocket a picture of a hood at a seam of light and it made him aware of his spine.\n\nBetween segments a small boy with a security pass that wasn\u2019t his but whose aunt worked wardrobe was led up to him by a man who looked like this was his difficult new job. The boy had a face as serious as the first day of school. He held out a drawing on printer paper buckled at the edges and it took a second to understand because it was mostly blue scribble and one rectangle and a stick man that had been colored with too much devotion. \u201cThis is your box,\u201d the boy explained with the solemnity of prophets, \u201cand this is you and this one is me. I am under, but I can breathe.\u201d He made sure to say the last bit like a command to the universe. Kabelo took it with the gravity required and promised to tape it to his mirror as if it were the map that would get him home. The man apologized for the intrusion but didn\u2019t make the apology heavy. \u201cHis mom\u2019s on the day shift,\u201d he said, \u201cand he thinks you are some sort of fish.\u201d The boy corrected him without looking up. \u201cDragon,\u201d he said. \u201cFish don\u2019t count. Dragons are allowed.\u201d Kabelo bowed because he believed in dragons and boys who insisted on them.\n\nHe had not expected the river to sound like traffic, but from the bridge where he stood after lunch while a camera decided how to introduce him to England, that\u2019s what it did: the constant hush of cars layered over the older hush of water until the ear chose which ancestor to honor. A woman with a guitar under her arm\u2014one of those buskers who had rejected chords and learned how to be percussion with six strings\u2014nodded at him the universal nod of people who choose public and then hate the crowd. \u201cYou from where the sun is bigger,\u201d she said, without asking, her mouth hidden inside a scarf meant for winter but containing a summer accent. \u201cYou have that squint. The sky here sits too close to your face.\u201d He smiled because sometimes strangers held up a mirror you hadn\u2019t planned for. \u201cIn my place the sky tells you the time like an auntie,\u201d he said. She laughed and tapped the guitar head against her knee. \u201cHere it tells you what it needs,\u201d she said, \u201cand sometimes what it needs is to be left alone.\u201d Her song was a loop that never quite agreed to be a chorus, and he thought of water in pipes, of how truth could be filtered until it thought it tasted better.\n\nEleanor found him with her phone held at a height that suggested bad news had been trained to behave. \u201cWe had a visitor at the stage door,\u201d she said, voice level, as if discussing an invoice that didn\u2019t add up. \u201cHe had a list with names that were almost ours. He had a pass that looked good until you touched it. Security had a conversation with him that will bore him for days.\u201d She showed him a photo on the screen\u2014a man with his chin tilted down the way people do when they want to use a hood as a mask. The photo did not show a plaster or a neck; it showed a way of standing that said I belong to the gaps between other people\u2019s rules. \u201cHe said he was there to shepherd,\u201d she added, and the word went cold as a spoon on a filling. \u201cWe\u2019ll run talent through the front tonight like civilians. Sometimes being ordinary is the cleverest costume.\u201d\n\nHe nodded and put the drawing the boy had given him into the pocket where fear had been living, to share the space. The idea of a shepherd tugged at a place in him that organized memory: his mother\u2019s church had a mural of a man in a robe picked out in cheap gold paint holding a lamb that looked like a cloud had been sheared. He had never liked it. The lamb always looked resigned. He looked at Eleanor\u2019s hair and found, as always, no plaster, only a line of neat on the nape like a decision obeying itself. \u201cIf anyone tells me to meet them at a door I can\u2019t find on a map,\u201d he said, \u201cI will ask them to meet me at the coffee machine instead.\u201d She grinned because coffee machines were the safest diplomacy in any building.\n\nBy late afternoon his body was negotiating a debt with his brain. It wanted a bed and silence that counted to ten slowly. The schedule wanted him on a couch under hot lights answering questions about the community and his creative journey and whether he had always loved holding his breath or if he had learned this out of necessity. He told the truth and then the truth made into a TV shape: that he had always liked how water made logic hush; that in places where people stand in lines for things that never arrive, a person needs to discover a place where they make the decision that sticks. The interviewer was a woman whose job was to nod passionately at everything. She nodded even when he hesitated, as if agreeing to pauses were a sport she had trained for. \u201cIsn\u2019t it such a metaphor,\u201d she murmured, as if letting him in on a secret about himself. He smiled because you can\u2019t argue with a person who uses the word metaphor as if it were a spice.\n\nThe building did its night thing, the lights backstage become a different species, cooler and more intent, the corridor air thicker with other people\u2019s adrenaline. He walked the tape again in soft shoes, not for privacy, just to remind his feet the shape of their obedience. He went to the dressing room and the drawing was taped to the mirror as promised. He wrote to his mother a picture of it instead of looking for words, and she sent back a voice note that made his chest loosen: a description of the neighbor\u2019s daughter doing the noise of an aeroplane with her mouth so accurately that the dog had hidden under the chair. He listened to it twice, then twice again because sometimes repetition is a balm.\n\nHe heard the fire alarm at first as part of the building\u2019s orchestra, a high, insistent instrument that had been given permission finally to have its solo. People who had lived in buildings like this knew instantly whether an alarm was real or bored. The crew moved with the speed of organized water, wrapping cables around arms, lifting what could resent the heat, pointing talent and staff toward exits that had been rehearsed once a year when a man with a clipboard he did not know had watched them with a stopwatch. The alarm\u2019s insistence took over the air. He stood, towel in hand, and looked toward Eleanor, and she had the look people wear when they are doing mathematics linked to corridors. \u201cWe go this way,\u201d she said, loud enough to be heard without turning her voice into panic\u2019s cousin. He followed with his bag, not because bag, but because documentation.\n\nIn a corridor that could have been yesterday\u2019s corridor if corridors had memories, a man stepped into their space with the confidence of someone who had seen this scene in a script. \u201cThis way,\u201d he said, with the assured kindness of uniformed authority, except his uniform was not quite a uniform. His lanyard had a blue that tried to be the show\u2019s blue and an emblem that would have fooled someone who didn\u2019t like reading. Eleanor didn\u2019t even look down. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cwe go that way,\u201d which is a particular kind of bravery: to contradict a sentence that expects to be obeyed without asking. The man\u2019s face did a shift you could miss if you were busy breathing. He looked at Kabelo then, not Eleanor, because he understood how the world arranges decisions, and he did a small head tilt that in certain places means come on, be reasonable. Kabelo surprised himself by lifting his bag higher onto his shoulder and saying with his mouth\u2019s politest muscles, \u201cMy mother would be cross with me if I didn\u2019t do what this lady said.\u201d It deflated the moment with its ridiculous correctness. The man destroyed the distance between polite and angry with a blink. \u201cProceed,\u201d he said, as if he had been in on the plan all along. Only after they had rounded two more corners and been swallowed by a stairwell thick with other people\u2019s coats did he confess to himself that he had felt a hand at the back of his own neck, a cold spot, as if a child had stuck a sticker there without permission.\n\nOutside the congregation of the evacuated stood around as if it were church after the benediction and everyone was allowed to gossip. Someone had brought out the boxes with the reflective blankets, and the sight of grown people wrapped in silver like products suggested to him a shop the world had decided to be. The alarm quieted by degrees, as if embarrassed. Someone from security with a notebook and a face like a cupboard promised in a loud voice that it had been a test triggered by smoke in a place that shouldn\u2019t smoke. People nodded with relief because the word test can be soothing in a city that believes in paperwork. Eleanor leaned slightly toward him so that she was close enough to be a whisper without sacrificing dignity. \u201cSometimes a test is also a test,\u201d she said. \u201cWell done.\u201d He didn\u2019t know exactly what she was congratulating him for\u2014not hiding in a corridor, not obeying a uniform that wasn\u2019t uniform enough\u2014but took it and tucked it where he kept other small medals, the ones that didn\u2019t shine in rooms with lights.\n\nLater, when the evening had tucked itself back in and the audience had been told that they were heroes for waiting, he found himself back under the kind light answering the public\u2019s applause as if shaking hands. The hood at the seam did not return; or if it did, it behaved better. The judges said their programmed lines with sincerity that may have been learned or may have been honest; it didn\u2019t matter because the shape of the sentences fit the shape of his day. Backstage, people were kind with their mouths and their hands and the little jokes that keep fear from turning feral. A runner handed him a phone and said, \u201cMom,\u201d as if that were a role in the script. He pressed it to his ear and her breath came first, then his name, then that small sound she made when she didn\u2019t want to cry but her body had decided to participate in the conversation. He didn\u2019t tell her about the corridor or the man with the blue that was not blue; he told her that the river had threatened to be beautiful at dusk and that a boy had declared him a dragon and that London was a place where oranges cost too much but tasted the same. She told him that Auntie Mavis had instructed three men and the dog to clap at the TV and that they had clapped until the dog sneezed. He heard voices in the background. He closed his eyes for a second at the sound of his name traveling across water and wires without losing letters.\n\nHe walked back to the hotel in a small group because cities are always better when you share their boredom with people who are not boring. The night was a color he couldn\u2019t name in English and didn\u2019t need to. Neon turned puddles into small trapped futures you could step over. He stopped at a shop that had flowers out front as if ready for a funeral or a seduction and bought a single orange, because that was how you kept promises across continents: one small citrus sphere carried in a pocket like intention. The man behind the till said something that had too many vowels to catch, and he nodded the way you nod when you don\u2019t need to understand to be polite.\n\nIn the lobby, a new face at reception looked up with the eager exhaustion of someone on their second week at a job that had already taught them too much about people. \u201cPost,\u201d she said brightly, gathering an envelope from under the counter. He took it because envelopes in lobbies are like questions in church; you accept them even when you know they\u2019ll be about tithes. In the lift he examined the handwriting. It had made an effort, like someone dressing up to go to the shops. Inside, there was hotel paper with a letter pressed into at the top with the dignity of logos. Thank you for staying, it said, in printed words. On the second page, a note in polite pen: Please find enclosed a complimentary pass for our spa\u2014a gift from management. The pass was a rectangle with a little shimmer along its edge, embossed. Tucked behind it, neat and cheap, a plaster, the exact kind stocked in all rooms everywhere for people who open stubborn suitcases with thumbnails and pay the price. He found himself laughing, an involuntary soft bark, not at the mysteriousness of it anymore but at the audacity of hotel generosity: they were trying to fix the world of messages and hoods with a rectangle that would keep a scratch from hairline to chin. He set it on the bedside table like a coin on a shrine, not to worship it but to keep his eye trained to what was ridiculous so he did not drown in what was not.\n\nHe bathed because hot water had been invented for men who felt the city on them like dust. He slid under until his ears went under and the room changed from hotel to ocean, muffled and steady and ancient. He held his breath not to practice but to remember. He felt the hotel around him anyway\u2014the elevator\u2019s cable hum through his bones, the steps of a person in heels in the corridor, the far-away argument of two men who had decided to spit their tired at each other. He thought of the pool at home with its blue that had been dropped into their neighbourhood like a promise and the way Mister Choi would sweep dust at dawn as if beginnings were a floor you could clean. He saw, despite the water over his eyes, his mother closing the door on elders, his aunt feeding a whole street with three chickens because numbers in a pot don\u2019t always obey math, Bongani rolling his eyes so hard they crossed the border and came back with news.\n\nHe surfaced and the bathroom gave his face back to him in sections, fog having smudged the mirror the way shame smudges teenage years. He wiped a circle into the steam and looked at his mouth, at the corners that liked to go up when trouble knocked because smiling had kept him from offending men with sticks when he was younger. He thought of a sentence he would never say on TV because it sounded like a small act trying to be philosophy: your breath is not a commodity. He patted himself dry like a man who had learned to be kind to this particular collection of skin. He slid the elastic onto his wrist and felt the old mark grin. He lay on the bed with the orange in his palm and made himself choose rest over scrolling, because scrolling was a door that never learned to stop opening.\n\nSometime after he had auditioned sleep, a set of teenage girls in the room above decided to make memories by dragging a chair across a wooden floor, then dragging it back, and then shrieking with the unfiltered joy of people whose lives were still primarily about being bodies. He grinned into the pillow because a person could hate that noise in one life and love it in another. His phone blinked once on the bedside table, modest as an eyelash. He reached and saw a message from a number that was not blue-lanyard but was also not the shepherd\u2019s rehearsed politeness. It was from the boy\u2019s aunt, her name saved now that she had completed the ceremony of letting a child approach a stranger. Thank you, it read, for the drawing on your mirror. He slept because gratitude is a hand on the back, too, because a boy had declared him dragon, because his mother had oranges stacked like prayers that didn\u2019t bruise.\n\nIn the morning he woke to rain that didn\u2019t believe it had to commit. It tapped the window like a neighbor trying to see if you were home. He peeled the plaster from the table, turned it in his fingers until the adhesive flashed dull, and stuck it on the inside of his left forearm like a child sticking a sticker on a school book. He looked at it and laughed quietly. If anything asked him to show a pass at a door he did not trust, he would show them his arm. He would say see, I have been marked by the ridiculous, and in the space where ridicule lives, perhaps danger would be confused enough to miss its step. He went downstairs to breakfast, to eggs and bread and love called by strangers, to a day that had already put its boots on. He chewed and counted and planned to walk to the river in the part of the morning when the city enjoyed being ugly. He texted Bongani the picture of the plaster on his arm and wrote only: please tell Auntie I have been vaccinated against nonsense. Bongani\u2019s reply came swift and savage and holy: Nonsense is airborne. Do not breathe with your mouth open.\n\nAt the pool later, the water did not remember him but was glad to see him anyway. He joined it like a person returning to a language they learned first. The lifeguard raised his chin in their ritual of men who pretend speech isn\u2019t necessary, and the window on the other side of the bench held only its reflections: him, blue, a moving rectangle of quiet. He let himself go under longer than a sensible man would before breakfast, to keep from becoming a man who listens for the knock when there isn\u2019t one. Under, the world made sense in a way that would never be possible on a stage, and when he came up he wiped his face with a towel that smelled faintly of a stranger\u2019s soap and told himself out loud a sentence that would make sense nowhere else: water doesn\u2019t lie, and neither will I. He listened to the way the roof echoed his voice back, a soft rebellion, and then swam a lazy length that could convince even a city to unclench its teeth.\n\nBy the time he reached the hotel again, it had learned his footstep. The woman at the desk waved like a teacher who had decided to become a friend. Someone had left a small parcel the size and shape of a book, wrapped in brown paper that had been used twice. He took it up, not heavy enough to be dangerous. Inside, a book indeed, the cover blue not silver, the title something earnest about breath and art written in a font that trusted itself too much, and on the flyleaf a message in a handwriting that had forgotten how to be shy: For when the room asks you to be smaller. Signed with a name he did not recognize and a phone number that promised nothing. He held it and wanted to write a letter to books, to tell them that their generosity could embarrass a human. He put it on the bedside table next to the plaster, next to the orange now flattened into an absence that smelled like time, next to the old elastic that had become a wrist\u2019s repetitive prayer. He sat and let London continue its solo outside, that relentless quiet-loud that made people fall in love with it and say they hated it in the same breath. He took a deep breath because his lungs still belonged solely to him. He exhaled and watched the window fog and clear, fog and clear, like the city practicing how to see him and how to forget. He would learn to do the same. He would learn to be seen as a man in a rectangle of water and then as a man at a bus stop and then as a man in a kitchen in Pretoria eating stew large enough to name. He would learn to be boring when boredom saved lives, and to be extraordinary when light asked nicely, and to be no one at all when men with hoods chose seams. He lay back and let the day kneel and ask his permission to come in. He let it. He promised himself, like a man changing a habit on a Monday, that he would not leave anyone behind in any corridor that could be rearranged into a trap. He promised the river he would listen even when it only wanted to complain. He promised the boy with the dragon drawing that he would keep making rooms where breath could be a sport and not a currency. He closed his eyes and for the first time since the plane had convinced itself it was a bird, he slept without choosing it.Chapter 8\n\nThe day after the day that had tried on three different names and kept them all, London behaved like a kettle at ninety-three degrees, close to boiling and not committing. Kabelo woke with his mouth tasting faintly of metal and triumph and other people\u2019s microphones. He lay still and told his lungs that they had done enough and could have the morning off if they wanted, and they responded by doing what they always did, which was keep him alive without asking for thanks. For a few seconds he couldn\u2019t place the hum in the room\u2014lift cables, air vent, a neighbor\u2019s hairdryer making an argument of air\u2014and then the shape of the night before slotted in and his chest did that private skip that was somewhere between laughter and suspicion. He glanced at the orange peel on the bedside table, cupped like a small boat after the passenger has stood and stepped onto land, and he felt the ridiculous happiness of someone who had done one thing, exactly the thing he had said he would, and had not been stolen by a door in the process.\n\nHe ate breakfast as if breakfast had been a friend before the lights remembered him. He kept his head down over eggs assisted by a salt that did not quite know how to salute and a toast that insisted on its job. The waitress called him love again and he let the word sit in his ear and warm its hands. His phone had developed the particular frenzy that follows television, and he scrolled until he recognized the signs of a brain being asked to be a host for a parade. If he kept looking at people\u2019s love he would lose the ability to recognize any other kind. He put it face down and talked out loud to his fork and the fork agreed: if the day wanted to borrow him, the terms would be printed larger than last time.\n\nAt the theatre the air had learned his name better. People remembered him between coffee and cables and their mouths did small things, the corners lifting in muscle memory. A producer had an itinerary that made noon feel like a threatening stranger. Media wanted a piece of his breath that did not belong to them: a radio spot where a man with an accent that had been to private school twice would ask him what he had meant by his skin under water; a daytime panel where women with hair that obeyed them would nod and say brave like they were discussing a color. He wouldn\u2019t say no to all of it because no is a door too, but he had started noticing the particular chill that arrives when your mouth is doing a different job to your body. If there was a choice between a curtain and water, he would still choose water because water didn\u2019t ask you to become its advertisement.\n\nThe unknown thread on his phone had learned a lesson, or it wanted him to believe it had. It sulked in silence, replaced by the honest aggression of tabloids who wanted to frame him with stock phrases\u2014overnight sensation, township talent, young man swims against the tide\u2014and the more expensive attention of a heritage magazine eager to claim him as something poetic and necessary. There was a voicemail with an American accent that rolled its r\u2019s like marbles, offering representation and a three-minute consult because talent windows were brief and culture moves to New York if you let it. Eleanor skimmed the day\u2019s obligations with that look she had, as if she had learned chess on a board with every square trying to burn her. \u201cWe\u2019ll ration you,\u201d she said, the way people in drought say water, and he nodded because rationing had been his first sport.\n\nThe little boy\u2019s drawing stayed on the mirror even after housekeeping had been, its blue stubbornness a compass point. He put on his cap for a second in the room, ridiculous and perfect, the elastic snapping against the same wrist it had known since it started its service. The plaster he\u2019d stuck to his forearm the night before was holding but its edge had begun to peel, forming a tiny mouth as if the sticker wanted to tell him a joke he would not like. He pressed the corner down the way a father would press a child\u2019s cowlick, firm and pointless. He told himself the absurdity of that square was his amulet and then made himself stop believing in amulets because amulets were just other people\u2019s systems disguised as kindness.\n\nHe crossed the river on foot because you should always apologize to water after asking it to behave on television. The air had that clear cold that makes your teeth feel newly grown. He leaned on a small patch of railing that had gathered initials in black marker, declarations that T loves V and K was here and someone had drawn a heart that looked like two potatoes kissing. He freed his breath in a long stream and watched it leave him. Across the way a busker who might have been the same woman from before or a cousin of her determination tuned a guitar with the intensity of a surgeon deciding how much to cut. She saw his hand on the railing and gave him a nod that in this city counted as intimacy. \u201cYou look like the inside of a matchbox,\u201d she said, humor in the scarf of her voice. He laughed and pointed to his forearm. \u201cI have my vaccination,\u201d he said, and showed her the plaster. She kicked a boot against the case with coins and made a sound that was almost a cough. \u201cWe\u2019re all marked,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of us choose the sticker. Some of us are given one and then pretend it\u2019s jewelry.\u201d\n\nHe got back to the theatre early because being early was also a ritual against theft. In the green room, twins sparkled in daylight like sequins that had been told to be serious. The woman in the wheelchair and her mouth full of jokes she had now spent raised a toast with a paper cup of water and said, \u201cIf we all win, do we have to split the prize into cousins?\u201d and the room did its gentle laugh. The boy with the invisible piano had slept exactly three hours and announced it like a weather report. Paul read out the running order like the names of saints and reminded them their job was to remind the audience they had lungs.\n\nThere was a meeting with the people who found advertising money. It was held in a small room where the furniture had been designed to encourage agreement. A man in a jacket that had been fitted by someone who did not like him very much said he saw brand partnerships for him, partnerships built around athletic fabrics and bottled liquids with names that sounded like machines. Kabelo nodded as if he were listening to a sermon he could not afford to stand up during. The man used phrases that had numbers in them\u2014market capture, cross-platform\u2014and not once did he say the word water. Eleanor sat slightly behind him with the attentive stillness of someone who would not let the world put a bill on the table and then move the salt so you couldn\u2019t reach it. When they left, she said, \u201cWe can let some of them love you. We don\u2019t have to adopt their parents.\u201d He grinned because metaphors were how he spent money on kindness.\n\nIt was in the corridor by the props department that he saw her again, the woman of the clipboard species, hair tied back like a woman who refuses the wind. She had changed her coat for one without a belt but she remained a loyal servant of beige. Her lanyard was inside her blouse as if it were a modesty. She was speaking to a man who could have been a driver or a stagehand or someone pretending to be both, and as she tilted her head he caught the edge of adhesive at her neck again, the tiny dull square like a lie that had achieved statehood. He lowered his eyes because staring is its own permission, and he kept walking until the corridor returned to being a corridor and not a trial. He didn\u2019t tell Eleanor because he was tired of making shapes out of plaster squares when whole men in hoods had tried to shepherd him like a stubborn sheep. He saved it for later like you save bone broth for a day your body insists on soup.\n\nPretoria did not wait for permission to be part of the day. Between rehearsal and a bland sandwich that was doing its best, his mother called. She had timed it as if she had pressed her ear to the universe and listened for a silence big enough to fit her voice. \u201cThey came yesterday,\u201d she said without greeting, and he could hear Auntie Mavis clucking in the background like a hen with opinions. \u201cMen from a\u2026 a foundation. They said they could help you manage the pressure. They said your bank must be strong for your dreams to rest on it. I told them we keep our money under the kettle. They laughed and then they stopped laughing when I kept looking at them. One had a plaster on the neck like he cut himself shaving air. Mavis chased them with a wooden spoon that has discipline.\u201d Auntie Mavis\u2019s voice came in loud without asking; at some point she had learned how to make phones obey. \u201cTell London I am not scared of its little angels. I will introduce them to the broom. Also, your face looked nice on the TV. You looked like you were praying without being shy. Our street is full of noise about you. Mister Choi put your picture next to the cigarettes and said we must all stop smoking for two days in your honor. I told him I would stop for two hours because I am sensible.\u201d He laughed and put his laughter carefully where it wouldn\u2019t spill. He told them he loved them and to keep the door locks as useful, and his mother made him say the words twice in Setswana so the house could agree to be strong.\n\nSecurity tweaked their plan with that brisk British acceptance of inconvenience, the way a butler might sigh and nonetheless find your scarf. No sheep through the loading bay, no unshepherded staff exits; they would take the most public of doors, cameras and all, because anonymity had been painted with a target. He signed the paper that said he had been advised not to be foolish and initialed the places that admitted he would forget and try to be polite at an unwise moment. The unknown number had tried one more time with a new attachment\u2014a PDF wearing a government font offering \u201cexpedited cultural clearance\u201d\u2014and he sent it to Eleanor, who forwarded it to a number saved in her phone as HN, which he later learned meant a detective with boring shoes. The reply came back with a promptness that felt like a personal favor. Known actors, it read. Disposal recommended. He disposed of it by taking it out to the bridge and holding the screen up to the light and then deleting it while watching the river pretend to applaud with its brown hands. It didn\u2019t make the pride in him smaller to do that. It redistributed it.\n\nHe took his nap like a businessman on an airplane, upright but determined. Dreamless would have been a blessing; instead his brain rolled out a mat for a fragment: a door with blue paint flaking, a hand knocking with the confident rhythm of someone who had paid for the right, his mother\u2019s broom lifting to become a kind of stick that shepherds and men with hoods had underestimated. He woke with his heart in his neck and calmed it with the sort of deep breaths that had earned him his right to be here.\n\nThe results show had its own feral energy. The audience came pre-charged with their voting choices like a congregation that arrived with its amens tallied. The hosts did their harmless mischief with the relish of men who had found a way to stay boys, and the judges applied their faces like make-up, eyes warm and glittering and trained. He stood in his mark under the polite heat and felt the word finalist sit inside him like an old auntie settling on a couch, full of commentary. It mattered and it did not, and he did not know how to make the two truths hold hands without one squeezing the other\u2019s knuckles too hard. He had seen other rooms where a vote could change a life and had learned to put a hat under his heart when it rained.\n\nHe had one trick left that belonged to him and not to the show. Before the lid closed on the tank the night before, while the crew checked their latches and their safety signs and Ross counted three things twice, he had asked a question so small he almost didn\u2019t recognize his own voice. Could he write something on the inside. Ross had blinked as if asked a question about poetry while holding a wrench. Use the grease pencil for marks, he\u2019d said, if you must. Cameras might not catch it unless they kiss the glass. He had written nothing then because writing for a rehearsal is like eating for a photograph. But now, results night where the narrative wanted to own him, he slipped a hand to the lip of the tank and palmed the stub of the pencil like a boy swapping sweets at the back of a class. He leaned forward and, under the flare of the audience lights that reflected his silver into matter and story, he printed three words backward so the front would read right. They were not clever. They were not the kind of words that would make a producer clap. They said: I CHOOSE AIR. It was a joke if you wanted it to be, a tautology, a swimmer doing a love letter to oxygen. It was also the whole thing. If anyone with a camera saw it, if anyone at home paused their broadcast, if a boy with a dragon on printer paper caught it and made it part of his rules, then it would carry like a paper boat sometimes does in a storm, farther than its size promises.\n\nWhen the envelope was torn and the wrong name became a right one for somebody else, he was surprised at how exactly he had prepared for that sound. It had the same pitch as morning disappointment, the little fall your stomach does when you open the fridge and remember you forgot to buy milk. Then the applause rose like a solution in search of a problem and the hosts said his name the way good men say names when they need to be kind, and the other finalists touched his shoulder as if he were already a ghost and needed to be reminded of his outline. The woman in the wheelchair who had made more jokes in twenty-four hours than some people make in a life rolled up and said through a grin that did not ask to be believed, \u201cThey are wrong exactly the right amount,\u201d and he believed her because he wanted to and because she carried a may you in a mouth that didn\u2019t owe you anything.\n\nHe smiled with his mouth for the cameras and didn\u2019t sell his eyes. He said the sentences that keep you inside the building until your paperwork is stamped and you have your own name back. He did not swallow disappointment because swallowing is what makes it grow. He stood in it like a puddle and then stepped out because cold water is an old friend. Eleanor\u2019s hand found his shoulder blade the precise way a coach\u2019s hand had once found the place his mother had said had no name in English. \u201cWe\u2019re going to walk through the front,\u201d she said chirp-bright for anyone listening, and under it a river: stay with me now. He stayed.\n\nThe lobby, with its marble pretending to be more honest than it was, had gathered fans like a kitchen gathers cousins. Signs with names hand-lettered in the sleepy love of teenagers, phones lifted like bright starlings, the crackle that happens when people want something and are trying to be nice while wanting it. He stopped for one picture, then two, then three, each with a person whose face he would forget and whose story he would carry anyway, because that is how this business breaks or doesn\u2019t. He said water doesn\u2019t lie to a woman who had cried already and then laughed at herself, she said it back to him as if it were scripture, and for a minute the world had sorted itself into orderly shelves.\n\nThe man with the hood had learned a new costume. He was a man with a cap this time, its brim low enough to make a line where a face should have been. He had the posture of a person who knew the trick of looking like he belonged to the building and he had the patience of a man standing at a bus stop he had set on fire himself. Eleanor did a calculation without using her hands. She altered their path by a meter as if it were a choreography, and the blue lanyards did a small tidal thing without anyone admitting to it. The man did not move toward them but made a small pivot which in certain neighborhoods meant we\u2019ll try later. The plaster on Kabelo\u2019s forearm caught the light as he waved at a girl who had turned eleven specifically to be here, and he felt ridiculous and invincible and loved and hunted and it made him want to run and to stand still at the same time. He left by the front door that had more faces than brick and felt the night greet him as if relieved he had not decided to be a story for other men\u2019s dinner tables.\n\nBack in the cocoon of the car that smelled faintly of ambition and cleaning chemicals, he allowed his head to drop back against the seat. A laugh escaped him at a volume too low to have ambitions. \u201cDid you see it,\u201d he asked Eleanor without turning to look, and she asked what she was supposed to have seen in a voice that had paid taxes. \u201cI wrote on the tank,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the inside. I wrote I choose air.\u201d She made the sound English women make when they approve of a dress in a shop window they cannot afford, a small exhale with mischief in it. \u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cBuy what you want when the lights are asking you to model their taste.\u201d\n\nAt the hotel there was a note for him that made his shoulder muscles pull together before he read it: a card with the detective\u2019s neat handwriting\u2014HN\u2014telling him that men who call themselves shepherds have been arrested twice in this city and keep learning nothing, that vigilance is another kind of cardio, that they had appreciated his being boring. It included a number he could call if asked to explain himself at a border or a lobby. Behind it, as if the world could not resist its own jokes, a small square of plaster was tucked in by somebody with an administrative sense of humor. He put the whole set under the orange peel and told himself he would not talk to inanimate things in a city that had learned to talk back.\n\nHe phoned Bongani because Bongani was the person to call when words needed oil. The line limped and then found its feet. \u201cYou were a miracle with muscles,\u201d Bongani said, and Kabelo had decided to love him forever from the second grade and this confirmed it. \u201cThey didn\u2019t let the right one win because when will they, but you did not drown, which was my only request. Auntie says the boy who drew the dragon has started charging people two rand to look at his paper and he keeps saying, \u2018I am under but I can breathe.\u2019 I told him to raise his price because he is part of capitalism now. Also a man in a cap came back to the garage and the dog bit his shoe like a politician. We all watched and no one helped because sometimes ethics restart themselves without your permission. Tell London if it tries to swallow you we will make that river spit.\u201d Kabelo laughed until his sides warned him gently. He told him he would be home soon enough to be laughed at properly in a garage where men knew how to make jokes stick to the floor.\n\nSleep came like a favor the third night, unsummoned and well-behaved. He put his hand flat on his chest and thought of the Johannesburg-to-Pretoria trains that used to keep time and of the robot near the spaza shop that had never learned the meaning of punctuality. He surrendered to the building\u2019s hum and for once it did not negotiate. He dreamed the most ordinary thing his brain could manage: warm water; his mother washing rice in a pot until the starch rinsed away and the water ran true.\n\nHe did the boring things afterward because boring had saved his skin. He let the show\u2019s press officer walk him through the corridor where photographers waited to tell him to turn his head slightly right. He sat in a small office with a legal pad in front of him and signed his name to a contract that said he could use the footage of himself without being charged for this act of generosity. He ate a sandwich whose only miracle was how efficiently it moved along. He went to the baths one last evening and swam lengths until a tenderness appeared between his shoulder blades and asked to be named. He sat in the steam room and listened to men breathe like engines, the way men share silence like money without saying what their fathers did with their fists. He walked in the rain without his hood like a man who had chosen what he would be wet from. He went into a shop and bought three cheap postcards with London printed in fonts with illusions about themselves, and he wrote each one to people who would not care about fonts: Auntie Mavis, Bongani, his mother who would keep hers in a Bible until the Bible stopped being a book and became a storage unit for important paper.\n\nTwo days later he packed the suitcase properly, not like a man on the run but like a person ending one room and choosing another. He put the plaster in the bottom of the bag between underpants and stubborn socks. He rolled the blue cap careful and placed it between shirts like a truth too fragile to be at the top. He looked around the room and tried to leave it the way you leave a room when you know it belongs to a person who might never know you were here. He went down to the lobby and the man with the closed-cupboard face said his name without error and wished him another kind of luck. The woman with the eager exhaustion of second week at a job waved and made a heart with her hands that she then pretended she had not made. He wanted to tell them all a secret about water that would turn their day into a better version of itself and then he kept it because not all gifts are gifts if they are given when the receiver is not hungry.\n\nAt the airport he did the dance of shoes and belts and liquids like a person who has been taught a new religion and has decided to be a quiet respectful believer. A security officer with a bun so disciplined it could be a proverb looked at his passport and then at his face and said, \u201cLoved you on telly,\u201d in a voice that had been taught not to love anyone. He thanked her and she let the corner of her mouth admit to a childhood. He waited at the gate with his bag held between his feet like a pet that might run, and he watched people watching planes and he thought the thought people think in that place\u2014what is the air like over there\u2014and he answered himself like a clever child\u2014same air, different mess.\n\nOn the plane he took the window again because greed can be holy when you know it. He texted his mother that he was boarding and she sent back three words: we are boiling. He smiled because this meant water on the stove and tea and a house ready to receive a son and possibly chicken if the electricity was friendly. He put his phone on airplane mode with a flourish as if it had been a rebellious teenager and he had won. He smoothed the elastic on his wrist like a man teaching his own heart how to obey. He closed his eyes before the lift and opened them at the tilt that makes your stomach remind you of your animal. He watched the city flatten and then blur and then go away in the way cities never do in your chest. He took his breath and gave it back and took it again as if practicing for older age.\n\nLanding felt like a memory being returned. The air smelled like a question you can answer. Pretoria had arranged its heat as a challenge and a blessing. The birds along Nelson Mandela Drive were at it, the old fight, the sky a complicity of blue. He came through the small airport with the confidence of someone who had already been loved far away and found that love did not give him a new passport to his own rooms. He saw his mother\u2019s mouth before he saw her whole, lips already forming his name for the third time, the way you say a prayer three times not because God is deaf but because repetition is how your own bone believes you. He let her put her hand on his face, that palm with the map of everything on it. He leaned into it as if there were any other religion worth practicing.\n\nAt home the kettle was indeed boiling and Auntie Mavis had flavoured the entire house with a pot that thought it was a history book. Bongani appeared with a grin that made two men jealous and pushed a box at him with the pride of a man who has saved carefully. Inside were goggles the color of petrol rainbows, new enough to smell of factory and regret. \u201cFor when your old elastic finally admits it needs to retire,\u201d he said, and Kabelo laughed because men like them had always been bad at goodbyes and excellent at buying items that said the unsayable. He took the elastic from his wrist and held it between finger and thumb like a relic and then slid it back on because you do not retire faith even when you have a new church.\n\nLater, much later, after stories had been put on the table like salted things and eaten, after Mister Choi had come in with a newspaper clipping that managed to both misquote and love him, after the neighbor\u2019s dog had sat on the stoep exactly where a dog sits when it thinks it is a prophet, after a small girl from up the street had tried to sell him four stones she had declared lucky so she could buy a lollipop, he took himself to the municipal pool because the water had not been allowed a say in this day. He walked there in the late afternoon when the sun decides to be kind to cheeks. The guard at the gate greeted him with the name he had been given at birth and not the one the street had tried to stick to his forehead, and that made a small part of him evaporate and return as rain. Inside the fence the grass did what it always did, and the water lay there like a patient in a good mood. He stripped in the change room that had always smelled like other people\u2019s lives and he put on the blue cap that did not tell stories about the globe. He slid in and the pool climbed him like a beloved who had not been jealous. He pushed off, arms spearing forward, the old drill in his bones, the Pretorian Serpent uncoiling with a certainty that made him feel like a road was being drawn under him.\n\nHe counted laps and then refused to count them. He held his breath until the edges of the world fuzzed slightly and then he did the ridiculous\u2014the thing no medic would sign off: he did one more beat, not for television, not for applause, not for lists and lanyards, but because the water asked and because he knew how to say yes to it. He came up and laughed, the kind of small dumb sound people in love make when they are alone. At the shallow end a boy in a Kaizer Chiefs jersey with shoulders sharp with future stared at him like a reporter. \u201cYou are the one on TV,\u201d he said, not as a question. \u201cSometimes,\u201d Kabelo answered, not to be difficult but because sometimes is the closest the truth lets you come without wearing out. The boy considered this and nodded, as if learning a formula. \u201cI am going to be something else,\u201d he said. \u201cI am going to do it inside air.\u201d Kabelo wanted to hug him and didn\u2019t because men like him were watched differently in pools. He said instead, \u201cGood. The air here is full of us. There is room.\u201d The boy smiled without moving his mouth, and when he turned to go he slipped on the wet concrete and did that stumbling dance all humans do, and caught himself, and pretended he had meant the whole thing.\n\nOn the way home he passed the jacaranda that still hadn\u2019t decided. The robot at the corner flirted with indecision and then chose. The white Quantum idled in the way of Quantums. The world had changed and had not, and he felt the weight of both the way you feel a towel on your shoulders: heavy until it does its job and then you don\u2019t notice it until you are cold again. At the stoep he sat with his mother and Auntie Mavis and the dog and whoever else had decided their feet needed a place to point. He told them about the river that gives advice no one asked for and the woman who believed dragons should be taken seriously and the way doors in London require you to know yourself quickly. Auntie Mavis cracked bones between her teeth with pleasure and said, \u201cWhat I want to know is, did you bring me biscuits that know their own mind.\u201d He went into his bag and produced the tin he had almost forgotten, fancy and foolish, and she held it like a trophy, and he told himself that whatever the show had chosen and whatever the shepherds would try, he had acquired the only prize that made sense, which was the ability to come back to a place that could love him and tell him when he was being stupid.\n\nHe slept that night without dreaming, or if he dreamed he did not remember, which is the body\u2019s best gift. In the morning he woke to water in the tap that burped and then ran right, and he thought of writing letters to the pool at Ironmonger Row and to Eleanor and to the detective with the boring shoes and to the boy with the dragon and to the river, but letters are a luxury in a house where the kettle whistles a schedule. He put the new goggles around his wrist and they made a mark that did not hurt, and he thought perhaps some marks don\u2019t understand borders because some skins are very old, older than passports, older than lanyards, older than men with hoods who love seams. He thought of the words on the tank and how they were both defiance and truism, and he said them again in a kitchen that did not need them to explain anything. He chose air. He chose water. He chose to learn which doors were doors and which were traps that had learned to speak. He stepped outside into a morning that had forgotten television and remembered bread. He walked, and the city, his city, walked with him like a twin.Chapter 10\n\nSummer made itself loud again, stamping its feet on the tin roof like an impatient guest, and the neighborhood responded in kind, turning up its own volume in small, domestic ways. Somewhere down the street a man tuned a car by listening to it the way a choir master listens to altos. Children tried new insults on one another and rolled the words in their mouths like marbles to see if they cracked teeth. Power went and came as if it had been invited to a party it didn\u2019t really want to attend but was too polite to ignore. Kabelo lay on his back on the cool patch of the floor where the tiles remembered being clay and stitched a plan together with the stubborn thread of someone who had done a big thing far away and decided not to let it be the only thing. The plan was boring in the way he had learned to revere: ask the municipality for the hall by the pool on Saturdays; convince Mister Choi to allow a notice on his spaza door without charging advertising rates; find someone with a printer; convince the lifeguard whose name he still didn\u2019t know to allow drills that weren\u2019t on the laminated rules. He imagined the words on paper: Breath School, free for anyone with lungs, donations in oranges accepted. He smiled because oranges had become a family superstition and who was he to disrespect a fruit with that much history.\n\nHis mother watched him with the tact of a woman who has raised ambition before and seen it burn and seen it bake bread. \u201cYou will do it slowly,\u201d she said, as if the sentence were a chair he could sit on. \u201cYou will not let other people\u2019s stories borrow your lungs.\u201d She bundled her scarf in her lap like she was holding a small animal too proud to be petted in front of others. When he told her he wanted to put his name on a notice she pursed her lips and then unwound them from their disapproval. \u201cWrite your name small,\u201d she advised, \u201cand write your times big. People love a time more than a man.\u201d He kissed her cheek because he didn\u2019t know any other ritual that did the job as reliably. Outside, a gull that had wandered too far inland argued with a miner bird, and the sky negotiated on their behalf.\n\nAt the municipal office, the woman behind the counter had a stamp that sounded like it had a personality. It thudded paper with the gravitas of a drum in a church that doesn\u2019t allow dancing. She asked him why he needed the hall and he said because breathing is catching and he wanted to help it spread, and she looked at him over the top of her glasses with the exact expression his primary school teacher had worn when he\u2019d told her he could see numbers in the air. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a category for breath,\u201d she said, not unkindly, and slid him a form that required him to choose between cultural, sporting, religious, or other, the box for other as small as the city\u2019s imagination could afford. He ticked other with an insistence that made his pen threaten to go through the page and wrote in block letters: Water Safety / Community Wellness. She stamped and stamped and then stamped again for good luck, and when she handed him back the papers she said, as if a thought had slipped past her guard, \u201cMy boy is scared of the deep end like it owes him money. You think you could convince him to be in the same room as it without crying?\u201d He nodded and tried to make his yes large enough to fit a child and his mother and the stamp. The woman smiled and her mouth remembered how.\n\nBack at the pool, the lifeguard looked at the paper as if bureaucracy were a species of fish he\u2019d never learned how to scale. He was a square man who stood like a door that had never known how to slam. \u201cNo stunts,\u201d he said, as if reading a sentence off a tiled wall. \u201cNo going under for showing off. No making fathers think they must call the ambulance so they can be heroes in front of their sons.\u201d Kabelo promised what he could promise, which was that he would teach lungs to be patient and bodies to be boring on purpose. He felt the slow shift in the man, the way acceptance sometimes arrives disguised as apathy. \u201cSaturday,\u201d the lifeguard allowed, pointing his whistle like a conductor\u2019s baton, \u201conly after the school crowd goes and before the men with bellies come to stand in the shallow end and talk about Bafana Bafana.\u201d It was a window so tight a hand would barely fit, but he had learned in London how to slip through spaces that thought they weren\u2019t doors.\n\nBongani turned up with a stack of flyers still warm from the machine at the copy shop that had spent a decade promising to upgrade its printers. He held them like a man holding a newborn, careful not to smudge because the ink had not yet committed to its life. \u201cLook at you,\u201d he said, full of pride that liked to wear jokes. \u201cMr. Air. Mister Air Rights. Mister Please Sit With Your Back Straight and Count To Ten.\u201d He read the text out loud with that performative solemnity he used when pretending to be an elder at a funeral. \u201cBreath School. Saturdays. You come with your lungs and a towel, we bring the rest.\u201d He lowered the page and raised an eyebrow. \u201cAre you promising snacks?\u201d Kabelo laughed and shook his head. \u201cOranges,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are a citrus-based organization. Auntie Mavis is chairlady of procurement.\u201d They took the flyers to Mister Choi, who allowed the notice to go under the cigarettes and over the gum with a little bow. \u201cFor you, discount,\u201d he said, and then, because business is business, charged them full price for the pack of cooldrinks.\n\nThe first Saturday, three kids came as if they had been dared. They had the look boys get when they enter a space that has not yet decided whether to love them: chin up, eyes hard, shirt held by two fingers because a mother in a hurry had not tucked it in. A girl came too, late, with plaits so tight they told of an aunt\u2019s ambition and a look that could shame sun. Her mother stood by the fence in a skirt that remembered different kinds of work and watched with her face, the rest of her body storing reactions for later. Kabelo had rehearsed the speech, of course he had, but in the moment he let it go in favor of the truth standing in front of him. \u201cWe are going to learn to be friends with the part of water that is not here,\u201d he said, gesturing to their chests. \u201cWe are going to teach the part of you that panics to sit down. We are going to clap for each other when we do difficult things. We are going to stop when we get stupid.\u201d The boy in the middle snorted and tried on a yawn like a jacket. \u201cI can hold my breath until my cousin fetches a whip,\u201d he bragged. Kabelo smiled and made his smile hard work to look at. \u201cThen you can learn to stop before the whip comes,\u201d he said, and saw that land in the boy\u2019s shoulders.\n\nHe put them through the silly things first: blowing bubbles, naming each bubble after a thing you didn\u2019t want to keep\u2014fear, uncle, darkness, tight shoes\u2014and counting the beats between breath and thought. He showed them how to float without surrender, the way a body can remember it was made inside water once. They laughed at first the way children laugh when you ask them to do something they think lives in a baby\u2019s book. Then the water did what water does, which is put hands on spines without permission and teach. The girl with the plaits closed her eyes of her own accord and Marco, the lifeguard whose name finally revealed itself reluctantly through a joke and a spill of tea, took one step closer just in case. For a half second she panicked because panic is loyal, then she remembered the counting and the counting called her back, and when she stood and wiped her face with the heel of her hand, she looked at him like a person who has opened a secret door inside their body and found a room they will keep to themselves for a while. The mothers at the fence did that non-clapping that women do for their own, the noise in the throat disguised as clearing it. Auntie Mavis, who had appointed herself to walk the perimeter as if other people\u2019s children were inevitably trying to escape, pretended not to look proud and failed.\n\nWord did what it does when it wants to live. By the third Saturday, there were ten, then twenty, a trickle in the shallow end that threatened to become a river. A boy with a burn scar along his forearm like a map of a country no one wanted arrived and refused to take off his T-shirt. Kabelo agreed before he was done asking, because dignity has a speed. A teenager with soft eyes who had learned to make his shoulders a story showed up and asked if he could sit and watch until sitting loosened its grip enough for him to slide in. A grandmother came with two little boys whom she kept correcting in a whisper even when they were silent. \u201cWe will learn to sing underwater,\u201d she muttered under her breath, \u201csince above water the world has gone deaf.\u201d He wrote down names like a collector of comets and learned faces in case someone needed him to remember them later in a corridor. Mister Choi sent a bag of oranges with a note that said, primitively and perfectly, for lungs, and Auntie Mavis carved peels into spirals like party decorations and made the pool smell briefly like a grove.\n\nWhat he did not plan for arrived anyway, because the city respects no calendar. A man in a tight shirt with a charity\u2019s logo that had been designed with words like hope and uplift in mind turned up with a clipboard and the polite smile of someone who has learned to extract signatures the way other people learn to pull weeds. He praised the program in tones that made praise feel like a receipt. He said his foundation could help with documentation for those children who wanted to compete internationally, and if they signed here and here, the network could try them in Johannesburg, in Lagos, in London, in places where talent could be a bridge. He used the words shepherd and pathway as if they were synonyms. He had a plaster on his neck, the small square dull at the edges. Bongani, who had decided to wear a reflective vest for no reason other than to feel official, stepped between him and the fence with the casual majesty of a traffic cone. \u201cThe only thing we are signing here is the register for oranges,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is your organization registered as when you go home and you take off your nice T-shirt?\u201d The man\u2019s smile adjusted but did not break; it had been trained. He held up his clipboard in a way that made it look like a shield. \u201cWe\u2019re on the radio,\u201d he said, as if that were a permit. \u201cThere is a caravan parked two streets away where we can explain this better to mothers who are too busy to stand in the sun. We have a refrigerator.\u201d\n\nKabelo felt the old cold along his neck, that ghost of a child\u2019s sticker placed there by someone you will never meet. He walked toward the fence with his towel over his shoulder like a sash. He did not raise his voice because you do not raise your voice at children or at men who come to collect them. \u201cWe don\u2019t take our children to caravans,\u201d he said, and felt his mother behind him, not in body but in broom. \u201cWe don\u2019t sign papers we cannot read while we are wet. We don\u2019t let anybody who says they will shepherd meet us at doors we did not open.\u201d The man tried to pivot to pleading and went through the motions with bored competence. \u201cWe\u2019re here to give options,\u201d he said, and opted to leave when he realized this line would not hold. When he went, he left the smell of the road and a small square of plaster that had lost its stick and fallen into the grass. A boy picked it up and held it like a beetle, fascinated by the edge between medicinal and sinister. \u201cLeave it,\u201d Auntie Mavis said, voice flat as a plate. \u201cThat thing doesn\u2019t have manners.\u201d\n\nHe received a call one evening from Paul, his voice smoothed by distance and a cup of tea. There was a festival, he said, in a city that liked to call itself world-class, a chance to do something with lights that would be kind, a panel where he could speak about breath and people would nod and then go to supper, an opportunity to be a person who had not been drowned by his own good fortune. They would fly him and give him a hotel which other people would have rushed to a long time ago. He listened and he was flattered because flattery is a spice, and he wrote the dates with the dignity of a man who had learned to put times in big letters. He checked the calendar he had taped to the fridge, the one that had people\u2019s names scribbled on Saturdays with arrows and question marks when a child\u2019s aunt had to work and the breath lesson needed to be moved to the afternoon. He looked at his mother who had chosen to plant beans where nothing had ever wanted to grow and had been rewarded with defiance in green. He told Paul he would think with his lungs and call back when his chest had decided. They said their goodbyes with the kind affection of men who had survived a corridor together. He sat in the doorway with the night ash-cold and thought about how you can turn a life into travel or into a neighborhood, and sometimes both, but never both on the same day.\n\nThat night the power went as if it had run out of patience, and the street performed its old resilience ritual of chairs on stoops and radios balanced like saints. The stars remembered to come and the moon behaved itself, not too full of opinions. A woman from three houses down sang quietly while she shelled peas, a kindness disguised as habit. Two teenagers argued about whether speed or honesty was better in a car. The neighbor\u2019s dog discovered a frog and apologized for it loudly. When his eyes had stopped complaining about the dark, Kabelo noticed a figure standing by the jacaranda that still hadn\u2019t risked flowers. Not hooded, no clipboard, just a person with their hands in their pockets like someone waiting for a bus that had stopped running. He felt his heart do the three beats and then the extra beat he knew too well. He rose before the old fear could wear his shoes, walked to the gate, and called out, the greeting loud enough to be heard by the right people and boring enough not to sound like a story. The figure looked up and the face arranged itself into something that remembered a shared history.\n\nIt was Mr. Lategan, without his coach voice and without the pool echoing him into larger than he was. He had a small parcel under his arm wrapped as if he had tried his best and then accepted that paper has opinions. \u201cYou left these in my locker,\u201d he said, sounding more defensive than the sentence required. Inside the paper were old notes, laminated by sweat and stubbornness, drills that had names like crocodiles and cars, and a photograph of a boy who looked like he had borrowed Kabelo\u2019s face, standing on the starting block with a smile as thin as the line between fear and boast. They stood with the gate between them like civilized men and Lategan watched the way Kabelo held the paper, the way a person watches medicine being measured. \u201cYou didn\u2019t drown,\u201d he said, and the compliment came out elegant because it had taken all day to find the right words. \u201cYour left shoulder behaved when it mattered,\u201d he added in the only love language he had. Then, after a silence that only old men know how to hold, he said, \u201cThere were men asking at the pool. Not the charity types. The types with shoes too new and questions too fast. I told them the only thing we export from this lane is sweat. If they come back, I will chase them with a kickboard.\u201d For the first time in years, Kabelo saw him not as accusation but as a man who had kept an eye out. He thanked him with a nod that let both of them keep their pride.\n\nThe call from London came the next day with a different flavor. Not Paul, not Eleanor, but a woman whose name filled the speaker with perfume and confidence. She was from a brand that could drape him in technical fabrics and teach him to prefer their water to the stuff that came out of taps. He listened and asked about clauses like a man who knew paper could try to adopt you, and he laughed once when she said they would like his story to bend in certain places. \u201cMy story is not a straw,\u201d he told her gently. \u201cIt does not bend to reach the bottom of your cup.\u201d After he hung up he marvelled at his own mouth and at the audacity of electricity when it let the call happen at all. He put the phone on the table and made tea with the reverence he gave to things that kept him tethered to a kitchen and not to a greenroom. He took the cup out to the stoep and found Auntie Mavis in his chair reading a magazine that had his face on the cover reproduced badly and his name spelled almost right. \u201cThey say you are a breath activist,\u201d she announced, proud, and he wanted to laugh because it sounded like something a superhero would stop doing in the sequel so he could raise his child. \u201cI am a boy who knows when to stop,\u201d he said instead, and she nodded as if he had finally said something that belonged in a house.\n\nThe Breath School grew not like weed but like beans\u2014slow at first, then all at once, the tendrils finding trellises where he had not thought to place them. A teacher from the primary school came and asked shyly if he might speak to a class about lungs and choices, and he did, bringing the plastic bottle he loved to crush and uncrush to show air its own tricks. A pastor came with his tie knotted as if it were a moral and asked whether he might mention the program in his sermon, and he said yes because he was not in the business of refusing free microphones as long as they didn\u2019t try to make his words wear shoes they didn\u2019t fit. A mother cried when her boy swam across the shallow end without choking on his own terror. A teen laughed at himself for the first time in a year and the sound made the water look up. An aunt threatened to bring a pot and a gas stove to the poolside because the boys ate like debt and she would not be caught short again. One Saturday a man arrived silently and watched from the shade with a cap pulled low. He didn\u2019t move to the caravans. He didn\u2019t move to the gate. When Kabelo went to him he found a face too familiar, not from television, not from dreams, but from a photograph put back in a Bible and turned into a bookmark.\n\nHis father stood up slowly, as if arguing with old decisions. He had the cautious posture of men who have learned to apologize with their hands. His shirt had been ironed by someone who wanted him to believe in second chances. He had a sleeve rolled twice as if he might be working soon. A small square of plaster lived at the crook of his elbow where a nurse might have found a vein, and it undid Kabelo a little because the body is an archive you cannot burn. \u201cYou swim now on the TV,\u201d his father said, finding the sentence he had practiced in taxis. \u201cYou stayed under like a story that does not end when I think it will.\u201d Kabelo felt a laugh and a sob find each other and agree to be civil. He didn\u2019t hug and he didn\u2019t scold; he pointed to the pool like a man offering a seat at a table and sadness did not go to his knife. His father nodded and sat, and for a long time they watched children teaching their panic a new job. After a while his father said, as if confessing to a teacher, \u201cI did not drown. I walked to the other side of the river and I pretended the other side was all there was.\u201d Then, as if asking not to be turned away, he added, \u201cDo you need a man to sweep, to fix things, to be told what to do?\u201d Some grace rose in Kabelo that was not his and belonged to the place and the morning and to his mother\u2019s broom waiting in the kitchen. \u201cWe are hiring anyone who can carry a stack of towels without stealing them,\u201d he said, and his father smiled like a man who had expected to be asked for tears and was offered a job instead.\n\nOn a Tuesday that smelled like wet bread, a woman came to the pool with a notebook and a camera-shaped like a sentence that would not be too long. She had hair that did not like rules and a face that did not use pity as a tool. He recognized something at her neck\u2014a square as tender as a memory\u2014and forced himself not to look at it as if it were a spell. \u201cLerato,\u201d she said, offering a hand that had been used to hold pens and shoulders. \u201cCommunity paper. I\u2019ve been trying to write about things that work. You would be surprised how few there are.\u201d She watched the children\u2019s faces and didn\u2019t ask them to look at her, which made him like her without negotiation. They spoke in the gaps between whistles and laughter, and she made notes the way a man makes tea: knowing when to stop pouring. When she asked about London he told her about river noise and sandwiches and how a building could develop a personality, and when she asked about the caravan men he told her that water makes truth happen faster. She looked at him the way Auntie Mavis looked at a chicken before she decided what sort of pot it deserved. \u201cPeople are going to try to use your words,\u201d she said, not as a warning but as a weather report. \u201cLet me write them down before they become a brand.\u201d He laughed because brands had tried to sit on his couch and he had moved the cushion.\n\nHer article came out with his name small and the times big and a photograph of the girl with the plaits looking at the water like it had apologized. The headline was not brave or clumsy; it had the look of a sentence that had decided to be useful: A Place To Practice Not Panicking. The paper was pushed under gates and put on counters and used as a doily under cups of tea, which meant the words would leave behind stains that made sense. A man from the municipality turned up with a clipboard and the nervousness of someone who had been told to check whether the rules were being bent. He stayed to the end and put his name on the volunteer list with a question mark by it, which made Kabelo want to hug government.\n\nNights moved into their steady composition, and the danger that had once stood in doorways learned to wait and then to wander off. The unknown numbers quieted like children when you give them a pencil and a task. London sent an email with a photograph of the tank lit like an altar, and he replied with a picture of the municipal pool under a sky trying to remember rain, and for a moment the two places agreed not to be jealous. When he couldn\u2019t sleep, which was less often now because exhaustion had decided to be generous, he walked to the pool and sat on the bench Mister Choi had donated in a burst of philanthropy that smelled like free advertising. The security guard, who had graduated from closing cans to closing gates, saluted him with a boredom that had become affection. He would slip into the water with the permission of a man who cleaned up after himself, and the pool held him without ceremony or cameras or speeches, just the quiet exchange of skin and element.\n\nOn one of those nights, some cloud decided to show off, stacking itself into bruises and opera. Lightning stitched two parts of the sky together with the efficiency of a seamstress who had been working for generations, and the air did that tight thing it does right before it speaks. He floated, the way he taught, at the softness between hearing and heartbeat. He thought about the words he had written on the tank in the theater that had decided to be kind to him that day, and he reached for the chalk stub he kept in his bag because water had taught him that nothing is permanent and therefore everything worth saying must be said again. On the concrete at the deep end, where boys dared one another to jump in and then laughed when they survived, he wrote slow and backwards, the way he had learned to do so that the world standing on the other side could read it. Ke kgetha moya, he printed, the Southerness of it pleasing him, the word for air able to carry spirit and weather and breath without complaining. He stood back and admired it like a man admires a pot that didn\u2019t burn even when it should have.\n\nThe next morning, kids pointed at the words and argued about whether it was Setswana or Sesotho and whether their teacher would give them extra marks for being able to say it out loud without fear. A mother ran her fingers over the letters as if checking whether language had a pulse. The lifeguard pretended he hadn\u2019t seen fresh paint on his concrete and then told a boy not to kick at the K while he hung on the edge. Lerato photographed it and didn\u2019t post the picture right away because sometimes you keep a thing to let it become itself before asking it to be seen. Bongani, when he saw it, read it out loud in the voice he used for drama, then swallowed and turned away to cough because there are sentences that don\u2019t require witnesses to work.\n\nHe called Paul back politely and told him he could come to the festival for one day and no panel and a quick train home because his bread was baking on Saturdays now, and Paul, who had learned to hear that not everything was a metaphor, arranged the tickets like a man setting a table for a person who eats fast and then helps wash dishes. He said no to the brand with the bottled water and yes to a local business that made towels that knew how to survive chlorine. He sent the man with the kickboard a WhatsApp video of a child who had taught fear to sit and the reply came back in three words: Left shoulder proud. He allowed himself to think about Eleanor and her hair and the way she had learned to hold her clipboard the way some women learn to hold very small dangerous animals, and he dictated her a long voice note he never sent that said nothing practical and everything honest: that he had found a way to give the light a job; that being boring had turned out to be the fun part; that if anyone ever tells her to shepherd him through a staff door again she should hit them with her lanyard.\n\nNot everything behaved, and not everything needed to. The caravan came back once, late, with the engine ticking in that expensive way. It parked by the corner where the robot refused to learn shame. Men leaned on it like punctuation marks, and the boy with the burn on his arm watched them the way cats watch birds, too smart to be caught by their own hunger. Kabelo called the detective with the boring shoes because sometimes you call boring on purpose, and a police van arrived with the old, weary indignation of a man who has already taken off his socks and been asked to put them back on. There were conversations with clipboards that blunted edges and paperwork that made nobody feel like a hero, and the caravan discovered other streets and the men learned that some neighborhoods keep brooms inside the doors. It did not feel like victory, more like a deadline extended, but sometimes you take those and you put them on the wall next to photographs of better days.\n\nOn a Thursday too hot for shirts he took his mother to the clinic for a blood pressure check because love chooses its glamour. They waited with women who had tied their children to themselves, with men who looked like they had learned to make small rooms of their own mouths rather than speak. On the noticeboard a paper hung crooked advertising a seminar about human trafficking with a font that had not slept enough. A small square of plaster hung by one corner from it, catching dust, and he felt a ridiculous urge to straighten it, to lend it dignity. He did not. He held his mother\u2019s bag and watched her let a nurse put the cuff on her arm with the same stoic courage she had used to teach him how to stand up in a pool. When the nurse said the numbers and declared them acceptable, his mother clucked her tongue as if she had done the mathematics herself and nodded once to the ceiling like a person thanking a god who had been on time for a change.\n\nWhen the first term of Breath School ended\u2014because Auntie Mavis insisted on terms and certificates or else nobody would respect a job done\u2014he printed ten cheap pieces of paper with elaborate language and gave them to children who held them like visas to cities some of them would never visit. The small boy with the dragon drawing had taped his original art to a cereal box panel and charged one rand to view it, two rand to borrow it for motivation, and he now demanded a certificate as well because capitalism expected its receipts. They took a group photograph that would end up crooked in living rooms and straight in their minds. The words at the deep end sat in the sun, patiently becoming part of the concrete through the slow chemistry of heat and time.\n\nOn Sunday, after the last of the certificates had been admired and spilled juice had been battled in a corner of the hall, the house was temporarily empty of noise. His mother had gone to sit with a neighbor who had been insulted by a cousin in a way that would require an afternoon to undo. Auntie Mavis slept with the television on purposefully, the way some people leave lights, as a deterrent to bad dreams. He walked to the pool alone with a towel around his neck and the key to the gate that Marco had given him like a blessing and a test. The sky had put away its dramatic inclination and replaced it with a modest blue. He slid into the water, which had learned him now, and floated on his back until the world ceased to need explanation.\n\nLater, when he dressed on the bench and laced his shoes, he heard laughter on the other side of the fence and looked up to find Lerato with her camera, her neck bare, the small square gone because skin heals and because motifs are not debts. She didn\u2019t raise the lens. She just stood and watched a man in a city choose air again because choosing is not something you do once. She lifted a hand in an unremarkable wave and he waved back the way neighbors do, as if this, and not lights or visas or alarms, had been the ambition all along. He walked home under trees that were still deciding and past a robot that had learned to be less shy and he thought, with the calm certainty of a person who has finally found a way to be a particular shape in the world, that there would be other doors and other men and other plasters, and there would be towels and oranges and Saturdays and rain. The pool would be open at nine. The children would come, and their panic would need work. The water would not lie. He would not either. He would teach them to stop one beat sooner than bravery asked, and to start one beat earlier than fear allowed, and that would be, for now, enough to keep breath honest.",

                              "content": "He said water was the only thing that never lied, but then again, he said a lot of things in the morning when the light came in flat through the curtains and the birds along Nelson Mandela Drive screeched like someone had begun to pry open the sky. Pretoria mornings always made Kabelo feel accused. There was the chlorine \u2014 a cough of it lingering like a bad joke on his throat \u2014 and there was the old woman next door dragging her mop across the stoep, the sound like felt wrapped around a blade. And there was something else, a press, the same one that told him to jump when he was on the higher dive board and the pool below looked like a moving mouth.\n\nHe tied the elastic of his goggles around his wrist before he left, a reflex, like a charm. You don\u2019t need it on the road, but still. He slung his thick towel over his shoulder, the one with a faded Springbok emblem, and stepped into the cooler hallway that smelled of cooking oil and dust. His mother had fallen asleep on the couch again, the TV still buzzing from a replay of a series where everyone spoke with the sort of clipped English that made his teeth ache. He switched it off with his toe.\n\n\u201cMama,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI\u2019m going now.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t wake, or if she did, she pretended not to, because she had learned when he needed words and when he needed silence. Her hair was wrapped in a pink scarf; her wrists were stacked with cheap bangles that clinked even in sleep. His own wrists were bare except for the goggle elastic. He thought of kissing her forehead. He didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t like to move sleeping people. What if you woke them into the wrong life?\n\nThe street outside already had its own breath. A white Quantum idled by the spaza shop where the owner, Mister Choi, was sweeping dust that would only return. A boy in an old Kaizer Chiefs jersey kicked a flat ball against the wall with the stubborn rhythm of someone calling down rain. The traffic light at the corner \u2014 the robot \u2014 lagged, clicked, lagged, surrendered. A woman in a nurse uniform smoked under a jacaranda that had not yet decided if it would flower. It was too early for purple. It was not too early for smoke.\n\nHe started down the road with the towel over his shoulder and his plastic sandals making that slap-slap-slap. Water, he thought. Water is waiting. It was a singular thought but it made itself big, like all true simple things do. He walked past Auntie Mavis\u2019s place and she came out, hips first, hair curlers like an army.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re off to drown yourself again,\u201d she said. \u201cTell your mother I\u2019m making that samp she likes. And tell her to stop letting you carry on with this thing. There\u2019s no future inside water.\u201d\n\nHe laughed, because the only other option was to argue. \u201cMorning, Auntie,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t say: if there\u2019s no future inside water then what about inside air? What about inside all this?\n\n\u201cShe has nightmares when you\u2019re out,\u201d she went on. \u201cYou know that? She sees you going down and not coming up again. And you with those skinny legs.\u201d\n\nHe flexed his leg as if that would fix it. \u201cI\u2019ll be back. I always come back. You know.\u201d\n\n\u201cHah,\u201d she said. \u201cYou only come back because God is too busy to collect you right now. Go, go. Tell your mother about the samp. And don\u2019t look people in the eyes. Not these days.\u201d\n\nIn Pretoria nobody said they were scared, except when they did, but they did it like a joke. He kept his eyes down and counted steps. If he reached the municipal pool before the sun broke clean over the Fountains, he could have it almost to himself. The hawkers at the corner were still setting out sunglasses and cheap cellphone covers, and the taxis had not yet grown impatient enough to sound like an orchestra of crows.\n\nAt the pool gates, the guard looked him over and then looked at the towel.\n\n\u201cYou again,\u201d the guard said.\n\n\u201cMe again,\u201d he said, with the good smile he saved for adults.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got that thing today? That competition thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cPractice,\u201d he said, because they\u2019d had this conversation enough times that it had its own first line.\n\nInside the fences the grass was tight-cut and the water was still, as if nobody had ever put a body into it. He liked that. The idea that he could break the skin of a thing that did not mind being broken. He shrugged off the towel and untied the elastic from his wrist and slipped the goggles up. His cap was already on under his hoodie; he liked to feel the binding of it, the way it made his thoughts sleek.\n\n\u201cStarfish,\u201d he said to himself, and then he slid in, and the water climbed him like a beloved.\n\nSome days he counted laps and some days he refused. Today the blue and white lane ropes blurred into one continuous stripe. His body found its rhythm almost greedily, arms spearing forward, pull, breath to the right. He had a drill he\u2019d made up himself \u2014 the Pretorian Serpent, he\u2019d named it, even though nobody, not even his friend Bongani, knew what he meant when he grinned and said the name. It wasn\u2019t showy, mostly. It was quiet and focused and then it exploded. He could hold his breath under for longer than most. He could draw himself over the water as if it were glass, and sometimes in his head there was music, weird music, not the type they play on the radio. He sometimes imagined it would make people cry, watching him. Even the ones who didn\u2019t care about water would be forced to care, if they saw how he could slice it open and then stitch it closed again with a flick of ankle.\n\nHe swam and he swam and then he was standing and the world came back: the guard discussing politics with a woman in a maroon top, the cicadas turning themselves into a chorus, the smell of fried vetkoek floating over from the stall that had popped up by the fence. He blinked water out of his lashes and he smiled, but the smile felt like it belonged to someone else.\n\nThe email was waiting when he got home, but he didn\u2019t know it yet. He stood at the kitchen sink and ate two bananas and half a cucumber, the cucumber because it tasted like cool water and he wanted to be extra today. He towelled his hair, he checked the bruise along his ribs \u2014 he didn\u2019t remember getting it, which annoyed him \u2014 and he made coffee so strong you could have floated a coin on it.\n\nHis mother was awake now, the scarf slipping back from her forehead, and she rubbed her eyes with both fists like a child. \u201cYou back,\u201d she said, then switched to Setswana, which she did when she was softer. \u201cDid you fly this morning?\u201d\n\n\u201cI flew,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone clapped.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re stupid,\u201d she said fondly. \u201cCome. Eat something. Auntie Mavis sent samp. She\u2019s trying to own me with food.\u201d\n\nKabelo touched her shoulder, then took his phone off the charger. It vibrated in his hand in that particular way that meant an email had dived into the inbox. He had sent his video last week, the one Bongani filmed at the little pool at the gym in town because he couldn\u2019t get permission to use the large pool after hours. \u201cA nation of rules,\u201d he\u2019d said then, half-laughing, because it was easier to laugh when doors were iron. He had cut and edited on his old second-hand laptop until the trackpad was smooth and unresponsive. He had sent the email to a set of addresses that had all looked official in an odd way \u2014 icons and banners and the right spelling \u2014 and then he had tried not to think about them.\n\nThe subject line was not that long. It read: Congratulations! Finalist Notification.\n\nHe felt something wobble in him. He felt his knuckles go cold, which didn\u2019t make sense because surely they should have got hot. He clicked.\n\nDear Mr. K. Maseko,\n\nWe are delighted to inform you that your audition has exceeded expectations.\n\nThe word delighted threw him. It did not have an easy translation that his mother used, and it also did not include space for doubt. He read it again, and again.\n\n\u2026 we wish to invite you to participate in the live Final in London, United Kingdom, scheduled one month from today\u2019s date\u2026\n\nHe felt the house tilt. He broadened his stance without realizing it. He thought of planes, those long white birds that made his stomach do tricks. Bongani at the garage, leaning on the petrol pump and saying, \u201cThey\u2019re not birds, be serious,\u201d but then also, \u201cBro, imagine you on TV with the lights. Imagine the likes.\u201d\n\nHe put the phone down on the table as if it were something that could overheat and take the plastic with it. He spread his fingers out. He could hear his mother fussing with plates on trays. He could hear the neighbor\u2019s radio going out of tune. He could hear something else: something under it all, a low note, the kind divers must get to hear when they\u2019re very close to the bottom. He picked the phone up again. He read the email from start to end. His name. His cheaply-shot video described as innovative. An itinerary attached as a PDF. Accreditation. A promise of accommodation near the theatre. \u201cTheatre,\u201d he said aloud, pronouncing each syllable, feeling silly and formal. He clicked the attachment and something heavy in the air got heavier. There was a logo. There were contact numbers. There was the promise of a small advance if he needed to secure travel before the full production arrangements. \u201cWe are delighted,\u201d it repeated. \u201cThe British public will be delighted.\u201d That was a different use, the word being stretchier than it had any right to be.\n\n\u201cMa,\u201d he said, and then louder: \u201cMama.\u201d\n\nShe came out with the tray, the way of someone who had been carrying trays since she was a girl and would never put one down until it was completed: two plates with the samp, a jug of water with one thin slice of lemon floating in it like a coin, a spoon for the sugar she wouldn\u2019t use. \u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d she said. \u201cYou think I\u2019m not coming.\u201d\n\nHe thrust the phone at her. She took it but didn\u2019t look. \u201cWe read things sitting down,\u201d she said by reflex, and they did.\n\nThey sat and she apologized for the tray noise and put the ear of the phone to her ear like you do with a call if you don\u2019t live in the world of cars that park themselves and fridges that talk. \u201cRead for me,\u201d she said. \u201cYour English is faster.\u201d\n\nHe read. He did it twice, because he could hear how it sounded as it left his mouth and then he could hear how unreal it was and then, when he did it a second time, it began to gain weight and shape. She nodded, very slow, the way she did when she was trying to keep a lid on a laugh.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d he echoed.\n\n\u201cSo you are big now.\u201d\n\nHe couldn\u2019t help it; his laugh was a bark. \u201cIt\u2019s the final,\u201d he said, like someone who would be believed. \u201cThey didn\u2019t ask me for money or anything. They\u2019re sending things. There\u2019s a list.\u201d\n\nHis mother wiped her mouth with a napkin although she had not yet eaten. \u201cA list of what,\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cPassport, of course.\u201d He gulped the water as if it were news. \u201cSwimwear. Costs they will cover. \u2018Talent coordination.\u2019 Sounds like someone who makes sure I don\u2019t melt.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d she said, and her voice got soft and then it got serious, \u201cyou can\u2019t be tricked into boats with no engines.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an airplane,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou promise me. You promise me this has no man waiting to steal your passport.\u201d\n\n\u201cI promise. It\u2019s the\u2026 it\u2019s Britain\u2019s Got Talent.\u201d The name itself made him nervous. It felt like a mountain.\n\nShe nodded: yes, she knew about these shows. She liked them, the way you like watching other people eat nicely, well, as if you are full only by association. Simon-with-the-T-shirts. The lady judge with the face like a Greek statue. The other one who always laughed too big for his tiny mouth. She said the names as though they were an aunty\u2019s children. \u201cBut this is you,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd those people will be looking with big, big eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be delighted,\u201d he said, and then he laughed because the word sounded sweet in his teeth.\n\nHe called Bongani. He didn\u2019t know how else to keep from catching fire in his own chest. The call took a long time to connect; the towers were sulking. When it did, the noise of the garage came through before the voice did: air spitting, a drill, tires shunted, someone asking for change.\n\n\u201cHear me,\u201d Bongani shouted. \u201cI am working. If you want me to love you, buy me a cool drink.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to London,\u201d Kabelo said, not yet aware that this would always be the sentence that split his life into the before and after. \u201cTo the final. The email came. I\u2019m in. I have one month.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause. Then: \u201cLike the show-show?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe show-show. The one people talk about as if it were a church.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d Bongani said. \u201cYou. Hey, man. You\u2019re going to swim in front of those white people and make them faint.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be delighted,\u201d he said again. He was starting to feel the shape of the word in his body.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Bongani said, and his tone shifted because he could be both clown and father in the space of a breath. \u201cOkay, okay. Listen. We have to go to church.\u201d He meant the place where men gathered to make plans and make them foolishly big. He meant the shisa nyama by the field where you could buy a braai pack and then hold court in the smoke. He meant telling everyone even the ones you weren\u2019t sure liked you. He meant becoming so loud that even the silence would have to listen. \u201cTonight. We go tonight. I\u2019m not waiting.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mother,\u201d he said, but then his mother nodded, as if she had heard both sides of the conversation. She was that sort of person.\n\n\u201cTonight,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will go two hours only, come back early. We will phone the lice place.\u201d\n\nHe laughed because this was one of her jokes, a joke about visas that had turned into visas being fleas, and then fleas being lice, and then the embassy being the place where lice lived. She made up the words and the world tried and failed to keep up.\n\nHe spent the afternoon not sure where to look. He looked at the ceiling of his room and noticed a stain that had shaped itself into a dragon. He looked at his toes and felt a sudden panic that they were too long. He looked at his passport \u2014 sense memory of the queue to get it, the man behind the glass barely looking up \u2014 and he looked at his old suitcase and he looked at the spot where his father had used to sit, if he\u2019d ever sat at all. He went to Mr. Lategan, who had technically been his coach once, in the way that a man at the Tuks pool can be a coach if he shouts enough at the right time.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d Mr. Lategan said, as if he were accusing him of stealing something. \u201cLondon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI thought you were joking.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said to find a stage. I found one.\u201d His smile was something that could have been a mistake.\n\nMr. Lategan nodded as if he were chewing an idea. He had small, bright eyes that held onto things longer than they should. \u201cBe careful,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOf the cold?\u201d He tried to make it light.\n\n\u201cOf the part where you think you are the same person on TV as you are here. That\u2019s ice. People slip.\u201d He paused. \u201cYou know your left shoulder drops when you\u2019re tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said, though he didn\u2019t, not really. He would watch it now. He tried to square his shoulders right then.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do too much. They like shiny. But they like simple. And you are\u2014 \u201d\n\nHe left it there. And you are. One day he would fill the blank with something kind. For now it hung.\n\nHe didn\u2019t tell his mother about what he saw at the pool, later that afternoon when he sneaked back after the kids got out and the sun was making diamonds on the surface. He didn\u2019t tell her that a woman had stood by the side with a clipboard and watched him as if she knew his middle name. He didn\u2019t tell her that when he had looked up to smile, because he couldn\u2019t help smiling at anyone who looked serious, she had turned away so fast her hair lifted and he\u2019d seen something stuck to her neck \u2014 a small plaster, or a bit of tape, or a sticker. He didn\u2019t tell his mother how he thought he saw her again later by the robots, standing under the jacaranda with a bag that didn\u2019t belong to the season. She could have been anyone. She could have been no one at all. The city was full of repeated faces. The city was a game of memory that nobody won.\n\nThey went to the shisa nyama when the light folded itself down into the gaps between buildings. Bongani bought the meat because he insisted that success should be tasted in salt first. Men clapped him on the back and some called him \u201cMr. London\u201d and some made a point of asking him what he would do there without meat as if that were the only thing that mattered. Older men told him about the cold and the way the women spoke and how their beer was not beer at all. They sang his name wrong on purpose and made up more stories. It felt good. He felt like a wooden chair right by the fire, he felt useful. He didn\u2019t drink. He put his hands out to the smoke and he listened to the fat sizzle and he thought of how, in a month, he would feel a different kind of wind on his face.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your trick?\u201d a boy asked him, leaning in under the smoke, his face slippery with the oil from the meat. \u201cWhat are you going to do that makes it more than just splashing?\u201d\n\nHe leaned down until they were eye to eye. \u201cI\u2019m going to hold my breath so long they\u2019ll think I\u2019ve gone, then I\u2019ll come up and they\u2019ll be so relieved they\u2019ll love me forever.\u201d\n\nThe boy nodded solemnly, as if relief was a trick you could rehearse. \u201cYou must not drown,\u201d he said, as if it were a secret.\n\n\u201cI must not,\u201d he agreed.\n\nWater remembers.\n\nAt night, when the house finally stopped arguing with itself \u2014 the fridge, the pipes, the bed \u2014 and his mother had gone to bed with a sigh of relief that she did not speak aloud, he lay awake and scrolled. He watched clips of the show and he watched people who had done things that did not make sense: a woman pretending to be a dog and making judges weep with laughter; a boy with a voice like a radio in a long, clean room; a group of dancers with bones that did things bones should not be able to do. He watched until the screen began to blue his face and he felt like maybe he was already somewhere else. He scrolled through the itinerary again. Heathrow. A car to the hotel. A rehearsal call sheet. Talent coordination. He googled the name of the coordinator and found a LinkedIn profile with a picture of a woman with good teeth. He googled the producer. He typed the names into Facebook and found people with the same names in completely different cities, one of whom was a chef who loved sausages.\n\nHe looked up swimming pools in London. He sketched out a plan on the back of an envelope: two swims before the final; one day to rest; a walk along the Thames, which he had heard was brown and cold and smelled like old money. He read about visas and then he read about how cold air will hurt inside your nose. He watched a video of a man throwing boiling water into the air to make snow. He shivered, imagining his lungs shrinking and then opening like fists.\n\nHe fell asleep with the phone on his chest. He woke once in the night and thought he saw someone standing in the doorway, but when he sat up, the shape went flat against the night. He lay back down, told himself his pulse was a tired thing, then counted breaths until the sleep returned and smothered him, gently, with both hands.\n\nThe next morning it felt as if the city had been dipped in something. The sky was brighter than manners allowed. He made a list on a piece of cardboard because paper felt too fragile. Baths to be taken. Shoes to be bought with soles intact. Use of the church bag as a travel carry-on if he could get the wax off it. He phoned the embassy \u2014 the lice place \u2014 and waited in the queue while a recorded voice told him about opening hours and the happiness to serve him. A woman came on the line and he spoke too fast. He did it twice. He booked an appointment. He hung up and paced the length of the small hallway and nearly walked into Auntie Mavis, who had appeared silently with a covered bowl.\n\n\u201cYou must eat,\u201d she said, even before greeting. \u201cYou cannot go on a plane with nothing in your stomach. They don\u2019t feed black people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey do,\u201d he said, and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bus to Polokwane.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t feed black people,\u201d she repeated, unbothered, and then she uncovered the bowl to show him something that was both stew and memory. \u201cAlso, look twice at anyone who looks at you longer than they blink. That\u2019s how they take people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho,\u201d he began, and then stopped. There was a kind of superstition you did not invite. \u201cI\u2019ll eat,\u201d he said.\n\nHe kept moving because if he stopped, the weight of it might find him. He went to the pool and counted laps. He practiced his breath until the edges of the world got fluffy. He walked home differently, as if the streets were new and had to be learned again. He bought a pair of those long socks the rugby boys wore because something about compression felt like being hugged by someone with a good plan. He stopped by the garage and handed Bongani a cool drink and let him talk his way through every possible and impossible scenario on the plane: pilots faint, landing on a river, celebrities in first class who might need him to save them from choking on a nut.\n\nAround dusk he sat with his mother and set the documents out. He wrote a list of the things she would need while he was gone, even though it was only a week. The list had things on it that had no business there \u2014 as if the electricity would not know how to behave if he were not in the house. \u201cWe are not a country that breaks because you leave,\u201d she said, but smiled when she said it.\n\n\u201cPromise me,\u201d she added later, and her voice did a different thing. \u201cPromise me you will not leave me here without telling me if you decide to go forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cMa,\u201d he said, and his throat closed. \u201cI\u2019m not going forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cPromise,\u201d she said again, because she had learned about a different kind of knowing. He promised. He meant it.\n\nThat night he dreamed of a pool in London, but it wasn\u2019t a pool, it was a stage, and the water was not water, it was light moving the way water does. In the dream he walked from the wings and the audience was a single creature with millions of eyes. He did not feel scared because the light was so warm that it felt like a body he had known. He dove and did not fall. He hung, suspended, and then he turned his body into a rope that tied and untied itself. He heard the judges speaking over each other, but their words were jelly sweets, bright and useless. He rose from the water without wetness and when he looked out there was one face he knew, right in the front row: his father, who was either dead or just living in another town with a different memory. His father did not clap. He nodded once as if he\u2019d always been the kind of man who nodded for extraordinary things. It was not fair. He woke up angry and then laughed at himself for it. Dreams will do what they want with your blood. It isn\u2019t personal.\n\nHe went to the embassy with a folder that had his entire life folded into it. He stood in the queue behind a woman who was going to Manchester to see a sister and a man who was going to Birmingham to tend to a funeral. He listened to them say their cities as if cities were the names of unkind cousins. He tried to breathe like the people in the yoga videos. He handed over his passport and his bank statement and the invitation letter and tried not to sweat on the counter. He thought the woman behind the glass looked like a teacher, and that was a relief because teachers have to pretend to believe you.\n\n\u201cPurpose of your visit,\u201d she asked, although the letter nearly shouted it from the paper.\n\n\u201cPerformance,\u201d he said. \u201cBritain\u2019s Got Talent. The final.\u201d\n\nShe looked at him then and her face moved like someone readjusting a painting on the wall. \u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cWow.\u201d It was like catching a glimpse of a friend\u2019s real voice under the careful voice they use for outsiders. She printed something. She stamped something else. She said, \u201cYou will collect on Wednesday.\u201d\n\nHe stepped out of the building into the hot midday and the world didn\u2019t change, but he did. He watched a man selling knock-off sunglasses and thought: you\u2019re a seller of the future in plastic. He watched a little girl eating a lollipop as if it might whisper to her. He watched his own feet and thought: these, toes and all, are going to cross a line that a lot of people only see on maps.\n\nOn the way home he cut across the park. The grass had flattened itself as if to make way for him. A dog ran and then stopped and barked once at him, the sound more like a question than a threat. He saw a woman sitting on a bench, the same kind of clipboard woman from the pool, surely not the same, not really, but the hair the same. She looked at him and looked away and then looked down at her phone. It was nothing. It was everything. He walked slower and then faster and then he called Bongani because the sound of someone else\u2019s nonsense can sometimes scare away your own.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be on the plane and forget us,\u201d Bongani said without preamble. \u201cAnd then when you come back you\u2019ll speak like a kettle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll speak like a tap,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll say garridge instead of garage and you\u2019ll drink tea from a cup that\u2019s thin, thin like paper.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring you a cup,\u201d he promised.\n\n\u201cAnd biscuits,\u201d Bongani said. \u201cNot the hard ones. The ones that know their own mind.\u201d\n\nWhen he got home, his mother had packed and unpacked his bag twice. The first time had been efficient, the second had been emotional. There were things in the bag that had no border crossing ability: a carved wooden spoon; the faded photo of him and his father on the day the Apies River flooded and they\u2019d stood on the bridge watching other people\u2019s things rush away like they couldn\u2019t wait to be nothing.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take that,\u201d he said, lifting the spoon.\n\n\u201cYou will take it in your heart,\u201d she said. She folded it back in anyway, stubbornness layered on love.\n\nThe day before he left, his aunt in Atteridgeville phoned and told him her neighbor\u2019s child had seen him in a dream and in the dream he was wearing red and water was falling up the stairs. He had to wear blue, she said. He promised to wear blue, though he knew the costume they had asked for was silver because the lights would pick it up in a good way. He figured silver was a kind of blue, if you squinted. He said he would listen to dreams even when they were not his.\n\nAnd then finally it was the day. He slept maybe four hours in pieces. He got up before dawn and showered with the water too hot for the weather because he needed to feel washed by something that would sting. He shaved the hair along his legs because he\u2019d seen the swimmers on TV do that and because he loved the way water ran over skin that smooth. He didn\u2019t tell anyone that he sometimes shaved his arms, too. Men in garages would laugh and then ask to touch. He ate oats and hated them and ate them anyway. He checked the passport; he checked the invitation; he checked the charged battery on his phone; he checked the charger; he checked the piece of paper with the address of the hotel printed in big black letters as if words could make you more sure of a place. He kissed his mother\u2019s cheek and pretend-hit his Aunt\u2019s hand when she tried to slip money into his pocket. He allowed her to slip it anyway.\n\nAt the airport the air was both cold and warm, as if the building couldn\u2019t decide if it was a winter or a summer, as if it contained all seasons and you could choose. He watched people walk with the particular stiffness of travellers who are trying not to run. He handed the check-in woman the letter like a magic trick and watched her face change when she realized he wasn\u2019t lying. He took his boarding pass as if it were a fragile thing. He held it too tight. He loosened his grip. He told himself not to pee and then had to pee again. He left his mother at the glass where all the mothers stand and made his mouth into the shape that people make when they are trying not to make a sound. He walked through the body scanner and the machine was kind to him. He put his belt back on with fingers that had forgotten how to move.\n\nBefore boarding, he sat at a metal table and sent Bongani a voice note, because sometimes words typed are brittle. He told him he loved him. He told him to watch the show. He told him to tell the men at the garage that not all heroes wear oil stains. He looked up at the screen and saw the town he was leaving cast down in letters that looked too small for its size.\n\nHe lined up. He moved forward. He handed over the piece of paper again and then he put his foot onto the plane and felt the whole thing holding him in an old kind of way, like a hug you\u2019d been promised as a child and forgot to claim. He took his seat by the window because he had begged. He pressed his hand to the window and felt nothing, because cold has no intention. He watched the other passengers file past: a man with hair like a small animal; a woman with a baby who looked at him with the steady gaze of judgement; a teenager with headphones as big as the moon. He breathed and counted.\n\nHe closed his eyes for a second and saw the stage again, light moving the way water does. He opened them and the plane began to move. His stomach made the small jump. His heart followed. He didn\u2019t think of the white Quantum that sometimes idled by the spaza. He didn\u2019t think of the woman with the clipboard. He didn\u2019t think of anything that wasn\u2019t the lift of wheels, the tilt, the sudden realization that ground had been optional all along.\n\nSomewhere over emptiness, in that first strange dark when the world below is a soft rumor and the world within is too loud to be a friend, he took the elastic off his wrist to rub the mark it left. He held the goggles in his lap like a child with a toy he refuses to give up. He felt the plane bank and he felt an idea do the same. He fell asleep then, mouth slightly open, the way he hated to be seen, and dreamed of a city that greeted him in a language he almost knew, and a girl who asked him a question he couldn\u2019t quite hear, and someone humming unfortunately off-key in the seat behind him. He dreamed, too, that his phone was vibrating with a call he couldn\u2019t answer because his hands were covered in water and he didn\u2019t want to drip on the screen. He woke, sweating, and found a tear tacky on his cheek. He wiped it away and chose the sky again. He did not notice the small vibration that wasn\u2019t the plane, the one deep in the hollow of his shirt where he had put the phone, a vibration from a number he didn\u2019t know with a message that said: Welcome. Please make your way to the exit marked Staff when you arrive, for expedited processing. Reply YES to confirm. He didn\u2019t notice that he had replied in his sleep. He didn\u2019t notice that his wrist still bore the mark where the goggles had been. Some marks don\u2019t understand borders. Some marks are entire languages you carry under your skin.",

The cabin light had been turned low, the sort of low that suggested a morning was waiting outside where morning had no business being. He checked the oval of the window and saw nothing much at first, then the grey revealed itself, a grey with gradients he didn\u2019t have names for. The wing was there, tipped like a long blade, and below it a city that looked as if it had been ironed flat and then folded back up to make room for itself. He swallowed against the dry in his throat. He looked at the other passengers as if maybe one of them would catch his eye and say, yes man, you did it, welcome, but nobody did. A man across the aisle was already watching something on his phone, sound off, subtitles running, eyes steady. The baby two rows up had gone to sleep in the pose of a small dictator, mouth open, fists at shoulder height, intent on dreaming of issuing orders.\n\nThe wheels touched down and the plane sang its soft rubber song. People began to move before anyone told them they could, the human need to stand up triumphant over instruction. Kabelo unclipped his belt on the second sound of the chime because he liked to pretend he obeyed the world when he did not. He felt in his chest something like laughter that had not found its way to his mouth yet. He rubbed the ghost of the goggle elastic on his wrist and it itched the way a healed wound remembers where it is. The cold was different here; it came through the closed window and asked him if he was sure.\n\nWhen the doors opened, the plane breathed out its people and the airport breathed them in. He stepped into the corridor that was both tube and hallway, carpet too clean to admit shoes. The air smelled like cleaned air, like someone from the government had come with a bucket. He felt his eyes sting a little and pretended it was the recycled air and not his blood doing handstands again. He followed the signs that moved like a sentence: Arrivals, Baggage, Passport Control. Everyone\u2019s faces were focused on their own destinations, which was a relief. He carried his small bag like it was his job. He held his letter so it would be very ready. He felt brave and small in equal portions, like a man holding a match in a cave.\n\nHis phone buzzed in a way that made him look at it without meaning to. The message was there and the message was clean in its assumptions: Welcome. Please make your way to the exit marked Staff when you arrive, for expedited processing. Reply YES to confirm. He felt the yes already sent under his thumb like an offense committed by a stranger who shared his body. He blinked at it and for a second considered the delete as if erasure were a time machine, then saw, lower down, another message from the official address of the show, with the logo he had already memorized from the PDF. It said: Our coordinator will meet you at arrivals. Look for the blue lanyard and the sign with your name. He read both messages twice. His mother\u2019s voice did that thing on the inside of his ribs, the one where a laugh is holding hands with a warning. Boats with no engines. He looked up and the crowd was moving. He tucked the phone under his palm the way you hide a stone you plan to throw.\n\nThe line for Passport Control looked like a story about patience. People queued as if they had practiced it since infancy. He joined and watched the officers behind the glass, their faces serious delivered in identical expressions, haircuts like decisions. He held his letter so the page would catch the light just so. He had not moved more than a meter in five minutes when he saw a hand lift a sign beyond the barrier, a hand slender and purposeful, holding a rectangle with his name spelled correctly and the theatre\u2019s logo printed small but present in the corner. The hand belonged to a woman whose hair was the kind of straight that cost effort, and she had a lanyard the blue of a sky that lived in brochures. She looked over the heads as men in uniforms allowed her to be where she was. She caught his eye the way you catch a ball only you see. She lifted her eyebrows like a signal that could pass as question.\n\nHe stepped out of the line without saying sorry because the apology would have been to no one. He held up his letter not because he needed to but because he needed to do something with his hand. An officer with forearms that could have belonged to a wrestler moved a rope for him, and the woman stepped in and placed her palm on the small of his back in that way white cities let their functionaries touch you without asking. Her palm was warm, which surprised him in a country this grey.\n\n\u201cMr. Maseko,\u201d she said, and her voice carried the musical authority of someone who has learned to make vowels do heavy lifting. \u201cWelcome. We\u2019ll get you through the boring bits. How was your flight?\u201d She was smiling like a person whose job was to be the human version of a nod.\n\n\u201cIt had a lot of hours in it,\u201d he said, and her smile widened as if she had a quota of those.\n\n\u201cEleanor,\u201d she said, touching her lanyard. \u201cTalent coordination. We\u2019ve got a car waiting to take you straight to the hotel. Big day tomorrow.\u201d She moved, and he moved, and the officer merely looked at the lanyard as if the lanyard was a passport for its own country. He thought of the other message. He thought of the word staff and how staff was also a stick.\n\nThey took a corridor that did not advertise itself. It had the smell of carpet that has only known polite shoes, and the walls were an off-white that might disguise any kind of dirt if you begged it. Eleanor walked fast but not fast enough for him to fall behind, and her shoes made a sound like a small horse in a distant field. She waved at another person with a lanyard, and that one waved back. He watched the mouths of words on signs that said Restricted and Authorized and imagined the rooms hidden behind them where the city was a body with its skin turned inside out.\n\nAt a door with a badge reader, she put her pass to the black square, and the light went green like money. \u201cRight,\u201d she said, a word that here meant yes and here meant this way and here meant we\u2019re going to pretend none of this is strange. The officer at the next post looked at his passport and at the letter, checked the photo with a gaze so fast it could have been a blink, then stamped as if stamps were an extension of his hand. The stamp felt like an answer to a question he hadn\u2019t had to phrase.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll love London,\u201d Eleanor said, as they walked, and her breath made clouds when they came out to the bit where the air had the right to be cold. \u201cIt\u2019s cruel and beautiful in the same week. We keep all our weather in one day. We keep all our opinions under our coats.\u201d\n\nHe listened and looked and tried to match the rhythm of his steps to the new hum. The glass did not end. The high ceiling felt like a sky that had been domesticated. He thought of the Pretoria robot that liked to hesitate and then surrender. He thought of Auntie Mavis and her insistence on feeding him as if flight burned food faster than breath. He wanted to touch the floor to confirm it would hold him. He watched Eleanor\u2019s hair for the small plaster he had seen on another neck. There was no plaster. There was only a necklace a kind of gold that knew it was better than his eyes could afford.\n\nThe car was not a car you could imagine bumping over potholes. The man holding the door had a face like a closed cupboard and said his name with an economy that made respect sound expensive. The warm air inside smelled of something sweet and chemical, pine maybe, or the memory of pine. As they pulled away, the airport unfolded in a series of long limbs. Outside, London stood up from behind its railings, a city pretending to be shy.\n\nHe had expected to be underwhelmed. People came back and said the same thing in different words: the buildings are old but not that old, the sun makes promises it can\u2019t keep, the river is a brown ribbon that thinks it\u2019s silk. Instead, from the first curve of road he had the feeling that he had walked into a book that had been on the syllabus of his life. Terraced houses leaned into one another as if panicking about falling over alone. Trees were bare in a way Pretoria trees were rarely brave enough to be. Buses wore their red like a lipstick you put on to remind yourself you have a face.\n\n\u201cIs it as big as the TV says?\u201d he asked, half to make noise, half because he wanted to hear Eleanor talk a little more. She clicked her tongue once, an English click, light and amused.\n\n\u201cOn TV, everything\u2019s either smaller or bigger,\u201d she said. \u201cIn person, it\u2019s as big as you. It\u2019s exactly your size if you stand properly.\u201d\n\nHe thought of Mr. Lategan and his warning about the ice of television. He rolled his shoulders back as if training them already to resist their drop. He was acutely aware of the space in the car, the distance between his knees and the seat in front, like he had been upgraded in a life he hadn\u2019t paid for. He took his phone out to tell his mother that he was under almost-sky, and found the message thread again. He clicked the unknown number and watched the way it displayed itself. There was just that one instruction, then the automatic gratitude his finger had sent while he was dreaming of cities that hummed. He wrote back now because sometimes choosing words made a person feel like they were choosing their day.\n\nWho is this, he typed, and immediately regretted the lack of politeness. He added: Sorry, please who is this. It felt like an offering in a place where he did not yet have offerings to give.\n\n\u201cEverything alright?\u201d Eleanor asked, and he realized he had made a small sound without permission.\n\n\u201cJust the usual,\u201d he said. \u201cMy friend wants me to bring him biscuits that know their own mind.\u201d He said it so blandly that it could have been a translation error. She laughed because laughter was easier than asking.\n\nThey crossed a bridge and he could see the water then, the river doing its old-man shuffle, wide and not quite sure it needed to hurry. It had a colour that was in between, not mud exactly, not tea, a colour that deserved a better word than brown. He pressed his hand to the window and felt that same nothing that expensive cold gives. Eleanor followed his gaze and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll hear the river more than you\u2019ll smell it. It gives advice no one asked for.\u201d He wanted to say, water doesn\u2019t lie, but he filed it away because some truths needed to be introduced slowly to new cities.\n\nThe hotel they stopped at had a lobby that made him check his shoes for crimes. There were people sitting at little tables with drinks that looked like plans. A man in a suit too well-behaved to be comfortable asked his name and made a note and produced a key card like a magician hating his audience. Eleanor navigated the check-in process like a woman who had unfurled this dance a hundred times. She handed him an envelope with the show\u2019s logo peek-peeking and the weight of many instructions. He tucked it under his arm as if it might fly off if he didn\u2019t remind it who owned who.\n\n\u201cHave a nap,\u201d she said. \u201cCall sheet\u2019s in there. Tech rehearsal is tomorrow afternoon. We\u2019ve organized a pool for you this evening if you want to shake the travel out of your shoulders.\u201d She leaned in slightly. \u201cAnd listen, don\u2019t let anyone else manage you. There are a lot of\u2026 enthusiasts at this stage. People who\u2019ve discovered they love talent only when it\u2019s nearly crowned. Stick with the blue lanyards. Stick with me or Paul. Don\u2019t give your passport to anyone who sells you a smile.\u201d Her voice carried a different gravity at the end, and he thought of his mother and her boats, and of Auntie Mavis muttering about how they don\u2019t feed black people on planes even when they do.\n\nHe nodded. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry for that kind of thing,\u201d he said, and she tilted her head as if he had said something that required later unpacking.\n\nUpstairs, the room was both precise and generous. The bed looked like a flat ocean that had agreed to hold him up. There were little bottles in the bathroom that smelled like they had been invented to make a person remember they were a body. He put his bag on a chair that didn\u2019t squeak. He stood by the window and saw a sliver of the river between buildings like a secret being shared by strangers. He took off his shoes. He lay on the bed with his arms straight by his sides because he wanted to see what it felt like to surrender without falling.\n\nHe did not sleep because sleeping would make time move badly. He opened the envelope and made his eyes behave. There it all was, neat as a row of clips: rehearsal time, audition stage cues, contact numbers, an emergency card that advised him to present it to any official if anyone told him to change his plan. There was a laminated backstage pass with his picture not yet there, a space waiting for his face as if the plastic were a mouth about to speak his name. There was a voucher for a meal in the hotel restaurant that threatened to turn food into theatre. There was a map with an arrow to the pool, the pool with a name that sounded like a man from a Charles Dickens book had built it.\n\nHe sent his mother a voice note anyway because paper was too cold for certain declarations. \u201cKe fihlile,\u201d he said softly, then in English for her pleasure at the turn of his tongue. \u201cI arrived. It\u2019s big. I didn\u2019t freeze. There\u2019s a lady with hair like a law and she\u2019s looking after me. The river is like an animal. I will call again later. Rest now. Tell Auntie Mavis I have eaten, even if I haven\u2019t, so she stops fighting the plane in her mind.\u201d He listened back to his own voice before sending it, a habit he hated because it made him feel like a man arguing with his echoes.\n\nHis phone blinked and the unknown number blinked with it. We facilitate, the reply read. Your reply is enough. Proceed with trust. He frowned because the sentence had something in it that his ear didn\u2019t like. It wasn\u2019t wrong, but it wasn\u2019t right either. He typed back: Is this from the show. There was no read receipt, only the calm flatness of delivered. A moment later a different message arrived from the official coordinator account: Don\u2019t forget your briefing at 5 PM. Pool reserved from 7 to 8 PM at Ironmonger Row. Please bring cap and goggles; lifeguard provided. It did not have room for a we facilitate anywhere.\n\nHe pulled the elastic out of his pocket as if it could vote. He rolled it between finger and thumb and thought of the woman with the clipboard on the grass at home. He pictured again the plaster on the neck, the way it had looked stuck there like a tiny flag of belonging. He shook his head because the room had too much silence for his brain to be allowed to invent extras. He set an alarm, then another because he could not yet trust this city to remember him. He showered too long, and the hot water ran down his legs and made him feel like London might be forgiven if only for how it could do steam.\n\nHe went downstairs early for the briefing because wrong is often found in lateness. The room they used was called a suite which seemed rude to normal rooms. There were already other people there, filling chairs with their particularities. A man with hair that stuck up as if his hand had been static for a year sat with his eyes closed and his mouth moving as if he were praying an audio book. A pair of twins wearing jackets with sequins mapping unnamed constellations flanked a woman in a wheelchair with a mouth full of jokes she hadn\u2019t told yet. A kid who could not be old enough to have finished grade eight twitched his fingers as if playing a piano only he could see. He breathed easier at the sight of them because there is a particular mercy in being among the weird ones and knowing you are part of their weather.\n\nPaul came in and clapped once and asked them to please not be trouble. He had a clipboard so full it might as well have been a way of saying sorry. He did the quick orientation, the jokes that dissolved any bubbles of frightening silence. He said backstage was both smaller and larger than it looked on TV, which was a philosophical statement hiding in a logistical announcement. He told them who to text if they needed to cry. He reminded them to say yes to all the applause and no to any contracts handed out in hallways that smelled like coffee and ambition.\n\nKabelo watched the way Paul spoke with his whole neck, veins doing other jobs. He watched the room watch him and knew that this ritual had been designed not merely to inform but to soften the edges of the future\u2019s teeth. He nodded at appropriate moments. He said his name when asked and it sounded thinner than at home, like the air had taken a sip of it before returning it to him. He laughed when the others laughed and took notes that were more pictures than words: a square for the stage, a scribble for the river, a rectangle for the pool like a promise he could put between his ribs.\n\nIronmonger Row Baths was not far and yet the way there felt long because turning a city into a map takes time and you always misplace an inch somewhere. He walked because walking taught him faster, and because the light stayed low but stubborn, like a man who has decided not to sit. He passed a shop that sold newspapers no one wanted to touch anymore and a man selling chestnuts from a cart that looked like it had waited under a bridge all summer for this job. The smell was a thing to apologize to; his stomach remembered its role. The pavement held the day\u2019s wet from a drizzle that looked like an argument the sky wasn\u2019t sure about. Cyclists ghosted past on bikes that hummed the sound of hazard.\n\nThe baths themselves sat stubbornly, brick and earnest. The tiles inside made the world into geometry and the women at reception operated the till and the door with a choreography that predated his arrival by decades. He showed the laminated card and the lifeguard on duty, a man with hair the color of toast and a jaw like a chopping board, lifted his chin in greeting and managed not to be bored when he said, \u201cYou\u2019re the telly one.\u201d He said the words telly one with equal parts amusement and solidarity, like having been on television was a sort of cold they all recognized.\n\nThe pool was warmer than he had expected, and the water had a texture different to the one children in Pretoria left behind on him. He slid in and the pool threw its arms around him with the enthusiasm of a dog who has learned your name. He let his body guess at distances and guessed right within three strokes. The tiles moved under him, blue and white and serious. He sank and held and felt the world narrow the way he needed the world to narrow. He could see the lifeguard\u2019s legs from below, planted, a tree on land he could reach if he chose. He did a length with his eyes closed because sometimes trust is a muscle and then opened them and found himself facing a face at the glass, a pale oval with fog around it, a figure on the other side of the viewing window where people sat to watch their people fail to drown.\n\nShe was a woman, or the idea of a woman, wearing a coat with a belt tied too tightly as if that would hold her inside her outline. She had a notebook in her hand and something on her neck that might have been a scarf or might have been nothing at all. He blinked his goggles clear and she was scribbling, and when she looked up she had the practiced glance-away of someone who knows that looking is a declaration. He swam a second length and a third, and the fourth he slowed and spun and came up halfway just to breathe and see, and the window was empty and the bench behind it held only a towel with a picture of a dolphin pretending to be a fish.\n\nThat night in the hotel he ate the meal voucher allowed him and it tasted like all hotels in all cities: a careful flavoring of comfort and control. He called his mother and listened to the familiar rustle of their house as her voice tried on its brave. She told him that the neighbor\u2019s dog had sat on their stoep all afternoon and that meant luck if you believed in the right things. He told her he had swum in water that belonged to other people, and she said, \u201cWater belongs only to God,\u201d with the correctedness of a woman who has seen taps fail and thinks of rivers as people. He didn\u2019t tell her about the message that said we facilitate because it would only have made her see boats in doors. He told her about the chestnuts and how the city burned small things to make big smells, and she laughed and said, \u201cDon\u2019t put that idea into Bongani\u2019s head, he\u2019ll burn the garage and tell me it\u2019s dinner.\u201d\n\nWhen he hung up he sat by the window until his breath made his reflection blur and the river held its line like an older lane rope gone brown with use. He scrolled again, because to scroll late at night is to volunteer your brain for extra shifts. He watched videos of the final stage, the lighting design that made ordinary sparkle like a scandal. He watched how men walked the stage before they performed, the way their shoulders admitted to the weight they had applied to them. He watched a clip of a swimmer from years before, a woman whose routine was less water and more performance art, how she had brought a transparent tank onto the stage and turned breath into a geometry problem everyone solved with their hands over their mouths. The comments under the video were a terrible argument about what counted as talent and what counted as a dare. He closed the app because people who sit in their houses and invent unkindness should not be given the speed of his blood.\n\nThe unknown number wrote once more, very late, as if it had waited for him to get soft. Reminder, it said. Staff exit tomorrow at stage door. Avoid public entrance. Wear jacket with hood. Avoid identifying markers. We will shepherd. He stared at the words and his hands felt too clean. He could hear Mr. Lategan\u2019s voice saying simple is shiny and shiny is simple and you are\u2014 and the blank long and full. He thought of Eleanor and her hair and the blue lanyard that got doors to behave. He wrote back: I have blue lanyard people. Please confirm your names. The gap between his message and any answer stretched like gum. He put the phone face down on the bedside table and the room took a breath he had not given it permission for.\n\nHe brushed his teeth and the water from the tap ran clear and efficiently, and he thought of how water in Pretoria sometimes coughed and then apologized with a hiss. He undressed and climbed into the hotel bed that had been designed to erase the outline of who you were before you lay down. He turned off the light and kept his eyes open long enough to edit the stage in his head until it fit his body. His last thought before the day let go was a small and stubborn one, not the sort of cinematic thought he might have chosen if he were writing his own scene. It was this: do not drown in other people\u2019s systems. It carried him into sleep like a current that knew what it was doing.",

                              "content": "Chapter 4\n\nMorning arrived sideways, a shy animal nosing at the curtains, and Kabelo\u2019s first thought was that London light had learned its manners from church. It entered without demanding rooms rearrange themselves. He lay very still and listened to the hum the building made, the way the air conditioner swallowed and released, the way distant pipes cleared their throats, the thin far-off roll of a suitcase wheel along carpet. He tested his body in small ways. Ankles flexed, hands opened and closed, shoulder blades pulled together to see if the left would sulk as Mr. Lategan had accused. Nothing hurt that wouldn\u2019t be soothed by water. He reached for his phone, and it showed him a time that didn\u2019t know or care about Pretoria. He looked at the river slice of view and told himself to learn the city in units he understood: breaths, turns, steps between door and stairs. In a country where the weather talked first, he would have to answer properly or risk being considered rude by the sky.\n\nIn the breakfast room, plates made the same noises plates make in any city that prides itself on being the center of its own map. People put food on their dishes as if the day needed an introduction ceremony. A waitress with a ponytail that had negotiated a peace treaty with gravity poured him coffee and called him love without asking permission, and he tried the word on from the inside like a borrowed jacket. He ate eggs that had never seen home oil and bread that cut his gums in a way that made him think of seriousness. He thought of Auntie Mavis\u2019s bowl with the stew that refused to be merely itself, and smiled over his plate like a man with secrets too domestic to be interesting to anyone else. His phone trembled politely on the table; there was a message from Paul reminding him of the hair-and-mic unit at eleven, a short slot with a camera at noon to capture his hands doing things like holding a cup, a technical at two where the stage would pretend to be generous. It calmed him to see the day printed like that, logistics acting as rope. He swallowed another mouthful and told himself he could choose when to be nervous, as if the animal of fear were polite enough to wait outside until invited.\n\nHe walked to the theatre even though a car had been offered, because cities filtered better through soles. He learned the crossings and their patience. He learned that cyclists here said sorry with their shoulders and buses asked for space with their bulk and not their voices. He crossed a small square where pigeons negotiated territory without needing borders drawn, and he stood for a second to watch two men argue softly about a painting in a shop window neither would ever buy. The theatre revealed itself the way theatres do, less as a building than as a notion: arches decorated by someone who believed in curves, doors that expected to be opened with intention, posters pretending the future had already arrived and had stars to show for it. He touched the doorframe as he entered the way he touched the starting block before he sent himself forward at the pool, as if saying hello to a thing with edges could soften it.\n\nBackstage had its own weather. The air was warm from bodies pretending to be calm. The floor wanted to trip you if you didn\u2019t consider it. People introduced themselves and their roles as if reading from a list they were proud of: Stage manager, floor manager, sound, camera two, runner, runner again, runner with more seniority. A woman with a headset and a mouth that had practiced efficient smiles ushered him to a corner where a camera waited to look at him like a person meeting a dog they might adopt. They asked him to hold a mug as if it were very important, to look out a window with his jaw angled like a question, to walk down a corridor once, then twice, then once more with less of his mouth. They asked him how water found him, and he said a sentence that sounded right while leaving out the parts that were not theirs to hold: that he loved the way silence formed around breath, that he liked a stage where audiences couldn\u2019t decide if they wanted to clap or hold their chests, that pools were a kind of church in places where the churches got tired. They asked about Pretoria and he gave them the morning birds and the robot that liked to reconsider its choices, and he did not give them the white Quantum outside the spaza or the woman with the clipboard who might have been no one. This sort of storytelling needed the shape of a bowl it would not spill from.\n\nEleanor appeared with her lanyard as if she had risen out of the building, and she made a little spiral in the air with her finger which translated cleanly to follow me, we\u2019re changing rooms. He went, because following was easier than pretending to be his own map in a house that had already decided its hallways. In the smaller room they called green without either grass or envy, she spoke in a tone that sat in the middle of the scale. \u201cSecurity wants to brief you on small things,\u201d she said, and her eyes flicked like someone reading a note without wanting to show it. \u201cNot because you\u2019re in danger. Because London collects people when it can.\u201d She waited for him to nod and then added as if tossing a coin, \u201cShow me anything odd you get on your phone. People are\u2026 enthusiastic, and some of them are not the kind of fans who clap in public.\u201d Her smile had written across it the word please.\n\nHe unlocked the thread with the unknown number and handed it over. She read and made the kind of noise you make for a fly near your ear. She thumbed something into her own phone with the determination of a woman telling a toaster not to burn the next round. \u201cNot ours,\u201d she said. \u201cNot any of the production partners we trust. We had an issue last year with a man who called himself an agent and turned out to be a bus with no brakes. If you get any instructions not signed by me or Paul or the senior stage managers, you delete them and then send them to me like you\u2019ve sent these. If someone in a corridor says they can get you better light, you agree with them and keep walking.\u201d She looked up, satisfied with a small plan. \u201cAlso there is a very boring sandwich for you, for later, in the fridge in your dressing room. Eat it before you get too brave and forget your head is attached to a body.\u201d\n\nThe technical rehearsal was a machine doing an impression of chaos while actually being a ballet. He stood on the black that ate sound and watched the lights argue their way into a compromise the lighting director could tolerate. The plexi tank had been rolled into position by men with arms that had done this a hundred times for acts that needed boxes, cages, rooms within rooms. It stood there, an aquarium without fish, waiting to be domesticated by his oxygen. He placed his hand flat against it and felt the cold travel into him. He did not perform properly; nobody allowed that. He measured. He counted steps from wing to mark, counted the seconds for the crew to wheel the tank to its kiss with the downstage line, counted the beats it would take for the camera to settle in the right eye. He sat on the rim for a minute and looked up into the rafters where metal held more metal, and he considered how even the wires had to have faith.\n\nThey talked through safety with the seriousness of hospital corridors. A man named Ross, whose hands had a surgeon\u2019s care for clamps and clips, showed him the quick-release on the tank lid. He showed him the sign that would mean stop now, and the other sign that would mean carry on because television required this risk to look like a choice. A medic with plasters like a magician\u2019s deck briefed him on the signs of blood sugar dropping and the taste of panic in the back of the throat. He nodded and repeated back the numbers because repetition was how you teach fear to sit on the step and wait. He slipped into the water, just for a moment, just to hear the sound it made when it agreed. The crew watched him in the way men watch someone handling something sharp; eyes alert, jaws ready to clench. He dipped under and rose and shook water from his cap like a dog pretending not to be ridiculous. Somewhere high in the darkness, a woman\u2019s shape leaned to whisper to someone else, the traitor echo of a clipboard tapping a thigh.\n\nIn the green room later, the cameras returned for their second bite. A producer whose mouth did sincerity like a sport asked him gently if there was anything about his father he wanted to say on camera. He considered saying no the way you consider running a red light when the road is empty and you are late. He said something that was both true and not. He said his father had taught him that not everything that leaves is lost. He said he had learned to forgive people he had not yet met. He did not talk about the bridge over the Apies River and the way the flood had looked like a procession. The producer nodded as if the shape of the sentence would be the same, regardless of the words, once it was put through television\u2019s patient factory.\n\nIt was only as he left the room to pee that he saw the woman again. A flash of coat, the belt cinched like someone who believed in keeping things in place. She stood near the stage door, not on it, in the zone where smokers earned their lungs their trouble. She had a lanyard tucked inside her collar as if it were shyer than she was. She looked up when he looked over and there was the practiced angle-away, the we-weren\u2019t-looking even while we were. Her neck, exposed as she turned, bore that small square of something\u2014the edge of adhesive, the shape familiar like the plasters they stuck on children after injections. He told himself it was the wrong distance to be anything but coincidence, and the word coincidence hurt more than he wanted to admit. He washed his hands a little too long and told his face not to give secrets to the mirror.\n\nPaul found him again with a look that was the cousin of hurry. He made the group of them\u2014twins, boy with invisible piano, woman in the wheelchair whose jokes were starting to filter into the air like incense\u2014stand in a loose circle while he distributed the kind of warnings that sounded like a chorus by the second time you heard them. \u201cEat something easy. No trying new foods during show week unless you want new results from your stomach,\u201d he said, wagging his clipboard. \u201cNo disappearing. No deciding you suddenly trust strangers. Your family members must come through the public entrance with tickets like everyone else; do not hand anyone your pass unless you are fine with finding yourself outside in a city that enjoys the taste of lost people. There will be press at the front door. If you don\u2019t want to talk to them, you don\u2019t have to, and if you do, remember you belong to yourself even when a microphone is under your mouth.\u201d He paused and the pause was a kind of respect. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m extremely fond of you already and want you all to be boring for the next forty-eight hours.\u201d He made them laugh and sent them away to their rooms and their small private rituals.\n\nThe afternoon bent itself into the shape of something survivable. He lay on the dressing room floor and breathed at the ceiling because sometimes breathing needed a view. He stretched the places that forgot they were muscles during travel. He wrote the call times on his palm because he trusted his hand more than he trusted his memory and because the ink\u2019s sting gave his skin a job to do. He ate half the boring sandwich and then the other half because duty has its own hunger. He texted Bongani a picture of his feet in socks that carried the hotel\u2019s name like a secret, and Bongani replied with a picture of the garage dog sleeping under a car with its nose in a pool of shade. He rang his mother and listened to her say his name as if it were an instruction to the air to be kinder. She told him she had bought a sack of oranges and that was luck if you believed in circles. He told her that the city wore its buildings like a coat it refused to take off even indoors. They talked about nothing the way people do when everything is standing outside the door pretending not to listen.\n\nAt seven, Ironmonger Row welcomed him again, stubborn and tiled. The lifeguard nodded and set his jaw to the particular geometry of a man who takes this as a job and a prayer. The water picked up where it had left off. He worked the Serpent until his lungs sang the warning hymns and then he worked it once more for the sake of disobedience. He counted six beats longer than his average and felt the little bloom of pride he would not feed too much in case it turned feral. On his next set, he felt it then: a pressure that wasn\u2019t water. He looked toward the window and saw, not the woman this time, but a man sitting like a coat on the bench, legs crossed at the knee, reading a newspaper as if newspapers still specialized in truth. He had that same not-looking, the attention that flits away in order to be less suspicious when it returns. Kabelo looked away deliberately and the chlorinated light broke itself into pieces against the surface as if nothing at all had happened. He finished his laps and then a few more because sometimes \u201cmore\u201d was the only prayer you could remember.\n\nBack in the hotel corridor, outside his door, a small envelope had been placed with the rectangular humility of hotel paper. His name was written in a hand that tried for neatness and only just made it. He took it inside and opened it not on instinct but because this was a place where other people\u2019s hands had too much practice. Inside, a generic welcome note from the hotel and a card for additional spa services lay as expected, and behind it, folded neatly as a second thought, a single square of plaster with the corner slightly turned, the adhesive dull from too much air. He put it down on the table as if it were a living thing and the table had a heart that might startle. He breathed out and felt the paper of his lungs.\n\nHe dialed reception and asked, in the voice of a man who was practicing being ordinary, whether there had been any mail for room whatever-his-number-was. The woman on the phone said no, dear, nothing that we didn\u2019t give you at check-in. He said thank you like a man in a play. He called Eleanor and reached voicemail and left a message which said only, \u201cCall me when you can, small thing,\u201d and he hated the way the word small made the world want to prove him wrong. The unknown number pinged and his skin did what it had learned to do: become an ear. Reminder: Staff exit tomorrow at stage door. Avoid the crowd. We will shepherd. The punctuation was organized and the tone had the blandness of someone who has told many people what to do and enjoys being obeyed. He took a photo of the message and sent it to Eleanor, and then he placed the phone face down again like he had the night before, as if the screen might start marketing trouble through light.\n\nIt was only when he was brushing his teeth, the hotel mirror turning him into a man who could be anyone, that there was a knock at the door. It was the knock hotels encourage: polite, two taps, the assumption of a person with towels. He paused with the brush in his mouth in the unflattering pose of people in bathrooms. The knock repeated itself with no extra information. He went to the door and looked through the peephole and saw nothing except the distorted suggestion of something that could have been a sleeve. \u201cYes?\u201d he asked in a voice he tried to keep in the key of unbothered. A small beat of silence. Then a woman\u2019s voice, the kind English had when it prepared itself for public spaces. \u201cEvening. Turn-down service.\u201d He took his hand off the knob and placed it against the door instead, feeling the small thud of his own pulse through wood. \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d he said, and waited. A breath. \u201cOf course,\u201d the voice said, and then footsteps arranged themselves in the corridor and went away. He stood there two minutes, counting, because counting was what he had left over.\n\nHe did not sleep so much as visit the idea of sleep and then apologize for leaving early. Dreams did their loud thing and he kept waking with the impression of faces pressed close to glass, of plasters peeled and reapplied like a password on skin. He got up before his alarm and did push-ups between the bed and the wardrobe until his arms shook with gratitude for a simple instruction. He drank water he didn\u2019t want because his body would need it to hold its breath and still want to live. He watched the light do its pale stretching and told himself again that the day needed legs he could trust.\n\nCall time pulled him into the building like a pocket being turned inside out. He let makeup do the small kindnesses it could, dulling the afternoon out of his skin and convincing the camera he was made of one piece. A woman wired him with a mic he would not wear for the performance because water and electronics have never made friends; it was for corridor interviews, footholds for a story someone would craft later to suit airtime and appetite. Producers came and went with clipboards like birds pretending to be heavy. The hosts appeared in their way, the one with eyes that could sell everything and nothing, the other with a grin that made old women decide to forgive the whole country for stealing biscuits. They clasped his shoulder, asked a joke that had traveled from another day and still kept warmth, and confirmed the pronunciation of his name with care that surprised him. He nodded and nodded and told himself that doing this was part of doing what he loved, that some stages come attached to tunnels.\n\nHe did not walk to the stage door. He stood by the kettle and drank a paper cup of water that tasted faintly of previous paper cups. He glanced at his phone and found it lit up like a face that had learned smiling as a defense. A final message from the unknown: Here. Now. Hood up. We will meet you in three breaths. He read it twice and his jaw arranged itself into a thing that kept him from saying what his mouth wanted to say. He forwarded it to Eleanor without commentary because some commentary adds noise to fires. Then he blocked the number because sometimes power is a finger you remember you have. He put the phone on airplane mode for thirty seconds to make it understand what quiet was for and then put it back on the world.\n\nEleanor appeared almost immediately, moving with the speed of someone who remembers they have legs only when they need them. She had a man with her who looked like a bodyguard only if bodyguards were paid in boredom; his eyes took in corners and turned his head as if that required introducing one part of himself to another. \u201cYou stick to us today,\u201d she said, and the sentence did not leave room for other hobbies. \u201cIf anyone tells you I told you to meet them, you bring them to me so I can meet my alleged errand.\u201d She touched his arm with the economy of a conductor tapping a stand. \u201cYou doing alright?\u201d He smiled because it was a tool. \u201cI\u2019m the right size for today,\u201d he said, and she rewarded him with a breath that might later decide to be a laugh.\n\nThey called five minutes in the way only theatres can, with the word five meaning it will be as long or short as it takes to be five. He stood in the wing with a towel over his shoulders that pretended to be ordinary. The plexi tank gleamed its cold invitation. The stage manager asked him if he was ready, which would be comical in any other building. He put his palm flat to the tank once, twice, as if checking a heartbeat. He rolled his neck with the guilty pleasure of a man who knows his body will obey. He thought of Pretoria mornings with their accusations and their dinosaur birds, of the robot that could not decide and the woman with the mop who turned cleaning into a chord. He thought of his mother in her pink scarf, of Auntie Mavis fighting airplanes with stew, of Bongani reading prophecies in oil stains. He thought of the Apies River swelling its dark chest and of how water keeps its own diary whether or not you ask to read it. He put the goggle elastic on his wrist for the walk to mark and then pulled the goggles up when the music and the light and the room agreed to begin.\n\nHe stepped into the light and it warmed him, and for a second London ceased to be a collection of opinions and became simply a temperature. The audience moved like a weather system, a murmur that rose and fell. He placed his hands on the rim of the tank and felt the cold insist one more time on its character. He breathed and counted, the old contractions of lungs that had learned to find room in the small places. He glanced into the first row because he had told himself he would, just once, to prove he could and then not again. Faces presented themselves like fruit in a market: glossy, watchful, hungry, bored. He looked past them without knowing he had, and his gaze landed for a sliver on a man standing by the exit in a jacket with a hood that shadowed his mouth. The man was looking not at the stage but at the crew, at the door, measuring, his head moving in those shallow arcs that don\u2019t want to be called nods. Kabelo placed the picture in his pocket along with all the other pictures and folded it small.\n\nHe lowered himself into the water and the sound inside took him by the jaw the way a mother does when she needs you to listen. The lid closed and the world narrowed in the precise way the world should when you choose it. He was barrel and blood and a creature evolved by his own insistence. He heard, distantly and correctly, the music being what he told it to be, not the sort they played on the radio, the private symphony you needed to learn by doing. He pressed his palms to the glass and imagined it was skin that had learned to be hard for a reason. He counted. He did the Serpent slow, then quicker, then still. He lifted himself inside the rectangle like a man praying with every part of his body at once. He felt the old urgency arrive in manageable packets, and he attended to them like parcels, stacking, storing, returning. He rose and the room made the sound that human throats make when they want to swallow all the air at once. He dropped again, later, and later again, and somewhere in his measuring he understood that the danger today would not be drowning but being kept too long by a system that believed it could own breath if it bought enough lights.\n\nWhen it was done\u2014no music, only the soft metal whirr of the lid\u2019s latch released\u2014he came up and the lights had decided to be kind. He blinked water out of eyelashes that had done their work and he heard a judge saying something with sonorous pleasure, syllables that would later be repeated back to him by people who wanted to speak the day into their kitchen tiles. He did not listen because listening would break the small altar he had built in his ribs. He looked down along the wing where the stage manager stood with hand poised above his headset mic, the signal for whether the floor crew should go or stay, and beyond him, in the seam between two curtains, a sliver of daylight from a door that had not been shut as well as it thought. A face in the seam, anonymized by hood, a breath fogging in the colder air beyond. He lifted his hand as if to wave to a friend. He waved to himself instead, the version of him who had no blue lanyard, no practice at saying no in new cities, who might have thought a staff door was just a door staff used. He looked once toward the wings and in that looking decided to be bored exactly as Paul had asked.\n\nThey rolled the tank away and he stood on the tape that said where he should be while the hosts came and a microphone turned a question into an offering. He answered in the small smiling sentences a man practices while looking at a bathroom mirror that holds his morning breath. \u201cWater doesn\u2019t lie,\u201d he said for the cameras because the sentence had taken an oath before he was born, and the crowd made the noise crowds make when they are given a sentence they can take home. He asked for nothing from them and received more than he could carry in his hands. He looked for Eleanor in the corner of his eye and found her, solid as a translation you trust, her clipboard held like a shield she\u2019d happily use. He saw the hooded man at the seam slide away, absorbed into the building\u2019s lungs. He exhaled and felt the fine print of the day settle on his shoulders and then roll off, silk or water or something invented between them.\n\nBack in the corridor condensed from congratulations and sweat, he let himself be steered because sometimes survival is letting the right people choose you. A young runner with eyebrows too honest to lie gave him his towel and he leaned his face into it not to hide but to remind himself that cloth was still a thing, that not all surfaces were glass and light. Someone put tea into his hand and someone else took away a question before it reached him. He sat for a minute on a low flight case and felt the dull throb along his left shoulder where Mr. Lategan had accused it of betrayal. He rotated it and promised it work and rest. The phone, which he had left on silent as if it were a child and he a bad father, showed him a hill of messages: his mother\u2019s voice so full it sounded like music, Bongani\u2019s shout over men pretending to be quiet at the garage, Auntie Mavis\u2019s short note that said, simply, \u201cWe are clapping,\u201d as if the clapping had been assigned to their house and they had done their part. The unknown thread was silent, its mouth a flat line.\n\nHe closed his eyes for the length of a breath and saw Pretoria as if the city had come to sit on the edge of his bed and watch him sleep. He saw the jacaranda that had not yet permitted itself to flower and he saw the white Quantum napping by the spaza shop and he saw the kid with the flat ball hoping that the wall would one day answer back. He saw water, the way it wore every city with equal indifference and equal love. He opened his eyes to the corridor with all its noise and recognized it as a different kind of river, one that insisted you keep your elbows in when you passed through. He stood and let the day attach its practicalities to him, and he thought of what the medic had said about sugar and the taste of panic, and he tasted nothing but salt and the metallic tang of lights.\n\nBetween interviews he found Eleanor\u2019s eye and she made space around him the way a dog will turn its body to keep rain off a child\u2019s face. \u201cWe\u2019re going together to the cars,\u201d she said, the sentence small and complete. \u201cThere\u2019s been an attempt to collect at the loading bay. We\u2019re asked to vary exits. I\u2019ll bore you with corridors.\u201d He laughed, not because it was funny, but because laughter was a key you could use if you made it when the lock wasn\u2019t expecting you. People think danger announces itself like a drum. Sometimes it comes as a request written in professional grammar with a full stop in exactly the right place.\n\nThey walked a path through the building that seemed designed by someone who loved corners. They passed a room where sequins were having a conversation with bad lighting. They passed a stairwell that smelled like other people\u2019s cigarettes from other shows. They passed a door marked Plant in a font that had not seen sunlight since someone last changed bulbs. The blue lanyards had formed a kind of creek for them to float down. At the last turn before the car park, he looked back once in that unfashionable way people do who know their backs are not eyes, and in the long corridor, under the throat of a strip light that flickered in a way that suggested a maintenance budget, he saw a man standing very still, hands in pockets, face in that hood\u2019s careful hood. The man did not move, but his stillness carried decision. Kabelo placed the image into his pocket without unfolding it and walked into the cold that had rehearsed itself for this hour.\n\nOutside, the cars waited in their correct line, the drivers with their closed-cupboard faces and names spoken in polite syllables. London exhaled mist into everyone's hair. The building made a noise like a ship agreeing with itself. Eleanor put her hand on the small of his back again and it felt like someone closing a gate gently to keep the goats in and the wolves out. He ducked into the car and the seat took him as if it had not been recruited that morning to this exact job. He glanced at the glass and got instead his own face layered with the building\u2019s bare brick and the river of traffic beyond. He laughed too softly for anyone else to hear. He thought of the message he sent to himself before sleeping the night before and let it bloom, not as an order this time but as a promise with an oar: do not drown in other people\u2019s systems. He breathed like a man who had held onto something and found it holding him back with equal kindness. He breathed and gave the driver the address printed bold on the hotel card, not because the driver needed it, but because saying where you\u2019re going out loud sometimes persuades the world to agree.",

She had fall-back prayers that required both palms to be flat on the table and her eyes to go narrow like she was aiming, and she had lists that didn\u2019t care that paper had always been poor. She made tea too strong for her own preference and stirred it as if strength could be transferred by spoon. The TV sat with its face turned toward the couch in that suggestive way that televisions have, a reminder that you could be watched by your own furniture if you misbehaved. News clips had found him, the show had found him, and now the house had a new draft that came under the door with the neighbors\u2019 curiosity. On the screen, when they ran the piece again between a politician apologizing without using any words and a weather map that turned the country into a bruise, there he was: her boy in a silver that could count as blue, inside a rectangle that looked too small for breath. The camera loved him because cameras love anyone who fights a thing and smiles after. She pressed her finger to the screen very lightly, as if blessing and scolding at once.\n\nAuntie Mavis arrived with the energy of an election. Her mouth came through the door before her hips, then her laugh like a borrowed trumpet. \u201cHe made me cry,\u201d she announced, not bothering with hello. \u201cAnd you know I don\u2019t cry for other people\u2019s children unless they die or marry wrong.\u201d She sat, then stood, then sat again, the body choosing moods the mind hadn\u2019t authorized. She pulled a newspaper out of a plastic bag like a magician finding a dove under a handkerchief. The headline did not have him by name but pretended to, as if fame were a shared surname. It had a grainy still of a man underwater that could have been a metaphor for government if they wanted to stretch.\n\n\u201cThey are saying he\u2019s a champion of breath,\u201d she said, reading, always surprising with the accuracy of a woman the world had tried and failed to keep illiterate. \u201cHah. As if he invented lungs.\u201d She peered around for the remote, found it, pointed it at the world, and then turned the volume low enough to make the moving mouths seem like a silent rehearsal for a life they would live later. \u201cWe will go to the shops today,\u201d she added, without transition. \u201cI will let people greet me like I am clever.\u201d She sucked her teeth and then remembered to be soft. \u201cYou slept?\u201d she asked the mother, and the mother shook her head and then tilted it as if to say, it\u2019s alright; I danced with fear and we\u2019re both tired now.\n\nBy nine there had been four calls offering to pray a blessing that came with a fee, two men in long shirts who introduced themselves as elders of a church that didn\u2019t exist on their street last week, a woman who claimed to be from a magazine that only printed black people if they were standing next to white ones. The elders smiled with their teeth and their hands did that thing of floating just ahead of their bodies, an attempt to touch the air near your shoulder without being accused of touching. \u201cWe are here for security in the spiritual,\u201d one said, and the mother smiled the way a person smiles at a dog who is trying to get into the yard from under the gate. \u201cWe have very good locks,\u201d she said, \u201cand we know how to use them.\u201d She closed the door and leaned back against it because leaning can be a weapon too.\n\nBongani phoned between pumping petrol for a man who wanted his tank to be full but not too full because he didn\u2019t trust the way gauges smiled. The line came through syrupy, as if the towers had decided to chew before they swallowed. \u201cHe was slick,\u201d he said, jumping straight to the music without instruments. \u201cCame to the garage in a jacket that thinks it\u2019s a season. Said he could get me to the UK in time to see the boy\u2019s next show, said family is important to narrative. Imagine telling me about narrative with hair like a stolen cat. I told him my passport is jealous of me and doesn\u2019t leave the house when I\u2019m not there. He laughed with only one side of his face. One of those laughs that took classes. He had a plaster on his neck, like he put a sticker there and forgot it. I saw it and I thought of something I shouldn\u2019t think and then he saw me see it and his laugh lost the little practice it had.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaibo,\u201d the mother said, a sound that was both prayer and swear. \u201cYou tell the garage men if they see that jacket again they must keep him busy with questions about soccer and wait for me to fetch a broom.\u201d\n\nBongani snorted because he had seen her with a broom when the neighbor\u2019s goat had tried to eat her washing and it had been a biblical lesson on boundaries. \u201cI told him,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat if he wants to meet our Mr. London he can watch him on the TV like the rest of us. He said TV is for people who haven\u2019t learned to be real. I said and yet here you are dressed like a flat screen.\u201d He made a little satisfied sound. \u201cThen he went away like milk at the end of the month.\u201d\n\nAfter he hung up, the mother picked up the old Nokia that still lived in the kitchen for emergencies, the one with the battery that refused to learn the meaning of tired, and typed out a message to her son that was both long and short: I saw you. Don\u2019t talk to doors you don\u2019t know. London has many of them. Eat something that remembers a pot. I am listening to the river on the TV. She sent it knowing he would be asleep or busy with people who would think their hands were important enough to hold his decisions. She went to the sink and held her own hands under the tap until the water changed temperature and finally told the truth.\n\nAt the theatre across an ocean, the day had decided to be busy. It busied the corridor, it busied the rehearsal schedules, it busied the small coffee machine until it sighed with martyrdom and then kept going. The show had made a decision about him that did not ask his permission: it would use his face for a particular shade of poster, it would interview him while he tied his shoes because they liked the line of an ankle, it would cut and paste his sentences until they lay flat and behaved. He let it, up to a point, because letting a thing can also be a strategy. He discovered he could step out of his body in tiny, legal ways: he could let them powder his cheekbone until it forgot about its own oil; he could stand at mark and let them circle him with cameras that hummed the hymns of their own gods; he could breathe deeper in the two seconds before he said a name so that the name came out with more authority than the name deserved. He held in his pocket a picture of a hood at a seam of light and it made him aware of his spine.\n\nBetween segments a small boy with a security pass that wasn\u2019t his but whose aunt worked wardrobe was led up to him by a man who looked like this was his difficult new job. The boy had a face as serious as the first day of school. He held out a drawing on printer paper buckled at the edges and it took a second to understand because it was mostly blue scribble and one rectangle and a stick man that had been colored with too much devotion. \u201cThis is your box,\u201d the boy explained with the solemnity of prophets, \u201cand this is you and this one is me. I am under, but I can breathe.\u201d He made sure to say the last bit like a command to the universe. Kabelo took it with the gravity required and promised to tape it to his mirror as if it were the map that would get him home. The man apologized for the intrusion but didn\u2019t make the apology heavy. \u201cHis mom\u2019s on the day shift,\u201d he said, \u201cand he thinks you are some sort of fish.\u201d The boy corrected him without looking up. \u201cDragon,\u201d he said. \u201cFish don\u2019t count. Dragons are allowed.\u201d Kabelo bowed because he believed in dragons and boys who insisted on them.\n\nHe had not expected the river to sound like traffic, but from the bridge where he stood after lunch while a camera decided how to introduce him to England, that\u2019s what it did: the constant hush of cars layered over the older hush of water until the ear chose which ancestor to honor. A woman with a guitar under her arm\u2014one of those buskers who had rejected chords and learned how to be percussion with six strings\u2014nodded at him the universal nod of people who choose public and then hate the crowd. \u201cYou from where the sun is bigger,\u201d she said, without asking, her mouth hidden inside a scarf meant for winter but containing a summer accent. \u201cYou have that squint. The sky here sits too close to your face.\u201d He smiled because sometimes strangers held up a mirror you hadn\u2019t planned for. \u201cIn my place the sky tells you the time like an auntie,\u201d he said. She laughed and tapped the guitar head against her knee. \u201cHere it tells you what it needs,\u201d she said, \u201cand sometimes what it needs is to be left alone.\u201d Her song was a loop that never quite agreed to be a chorus, and he thought of water in pipes, of how truth could be filtered until it thought it tasted better.\n\nEleanor found him with her phone held at a height that suggested bad news had been trained to behave. \u201cWe had a visitor at the stage door,\u201d she said, voice level, as if discussing an invoice that didn\u2019t add up. \u201cHe had a list with names that were almost ours. He had a pass that looked good until you touched it. Security had a conversation with him that will bore him for days.\u201d She showed him a photo on the screen\u2014a man with his chin tilted down the way people do when they want to use a hood as a mask. The photo did not show a plaster or a neck; it showed a way of standing that said I belong to the gaps between other people\u2019s rules. \u201cHe said he was there to shepherd,\u201d she added, and the word went cold as a spoon on a filling. \u201cWe\u2019ll run talent through the front tonight like civilians. Sometimes being ordinary is the cleverest costume.\u201d\n\nHe nodded and put the drawing the boy had given him into the pocket where fear had been living, to share the space. The idea of a shepherd tugged at a place in him that organized memory: his mother\u2019s church had a mural of a man in a robe picked out in cheap gold paint holding a lamb that looked like a cloud had been sheared. He had never liked it. The lamb always looked resigned. He looked at Eleanor\u2019s hair and found, as always, no plaster, only a line of neat on the nape like a decision obeying itself. \u201cIf anyone tells me to meet them at a door I can\u2019t find on a map,\u201d he said, \u201cI will ask them to meet me at the coffee machine instead.\u201d She grinned because coffee machines were the safest diplomacy in any building.\n\nBy late afternoon his body was negotiating a debt with his brain. It wanted a bed and silence that counted to ten slowly. The schedule wanted him on a couch under hot lights answering questions about the community and his creative journey and whether he had always loved holding his breath or if he had learned this out of necessity. He told the truth and then the truth made into a TV shape: that he had always liked how water made logic hush; that in places where people stand in lines for things that never arrive, a person needs to discover a place where they make the decision that sticks. The interviewer was a woman whose job was to nod passionately at everything. She nodded even when he hesitated, as if agreeing to pauses were a sport she had trained for. \u201cIsn\u2019t it such a metaphor,\u201d she murmured, as if letting him in on a secret about himself. He smiled because you can\u2019t argue with a person who uses the word metaphor as if it were a spice.\n\nThe building did its night thing, the lights backstage become a different species, cooler and more intent, the corridor air thicker with other people\u2019s adrenaline. He walked the tape again in soft shoes, not for privacy, just to remind his feet the shape of their obedience. He went to the dressing room and the drawing was taped to the mirror as promised. He wrote to his mother a picture of it instead of looking for words, and she sent back a voice note that made his chest loosen: a description of the neighbor\u2019s daughter doing the noise of an aeroplane with her mouth so accurately that the dog had hidden under the chair. He listened to it twice, then twice again because sometimes repetition is a balm.\n\nHe heard the fire alarm at first as part of the building\u2019s orchestra, a high, insistent instrument that had been given permission finally to have its solo. People who had lived in buildings like this knew instantly whether an alarm was real or bored. The crew moved with the speed of organized water, wrapping cables around arms, lifting what could resent the heat, pointing talent and staff toward exits that had been rehearsed once a year when a man with a clipboard he did not know had watched them with a stopwatch. The alarm\u2019s insistence took over the air. He stood, towel in hand, and looked toward Eleanor, and she had the look people wear when they are doing mathematics linked to corridors. \u201cWe go this way,\u201d she said, loud enough to be heard without turning her voice into panic\u2019s cousin. He followed with his bag, not because bag, but because documentation.\n\nIn a corridor that could have been yesterday\u2019s corridor if corridors had memories, a man stepped into their space with the confidence of someone who had seen this scene in a script. \u201cThis way,\u201d he said, with the assured kindness of uniformed authority, except his uniform was not quite a uniform. His lanyard had a blue that tried to be the show\u2019s blue and an emblem that would have fooled someone who didn\u2019t like reading. Eleanor didn\u2019t even look down. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cwe go that way,\u201d which is a particular kind of bravery: to contradict a sentence that expects to be obeyed without asking. The man\u2019s face did a shift you could miss if you were busy breathing. He looked at Kabelo then, not Eleanor, because he understood how the world arranges decisions, and he did a small head tilt that in certain places means come on, be reasonable. Kabelo surprised himself by lifting his bag higher onto his shoulder and saying with his mouth\u2019s politest muscles, \u201cMy mother would be cross with me if I didn\u2019t do what this lady said.\u201d It deflated the moment with its ridiculous correctness. The man destroyed the distance between polite and angry with a blink. \u201cProceed,\u201d he said, as if he had been in on the plan all along. Only after they had rounded two more corners and been swallowed by a stairwell thick with other people\u2019s coats did he confess to himself that he had felt a hand at the back of his own neck, a cold spot, as if a child had stuck a sticker there without permission.\n\nOutside the congregation of the evacuated stood around as if it were church after the benediction and everyone was allowed to gossip. Someone had brought out the boxes with the reflective blankets, and the sight of grown people wrapped in silver like products suggested to him a shop the world had decided to be. The alarm quieted by degrees, as if embarrassed. Someone from security with a notebook and a face like a cupboard promised in a loud voice that it had been a test triggered by smoke in a place that shouldn\u2019t smoke. People nodded with relief because the word test can be soothing in a city that believes in paperwork. Eleanor leaned slightly toward him so that she was close enough to be a whisper without sacrificing dignity. \u201cSometimes a test is also a test,\u201d she said. \u201cWell done.\u201d He didn\u2019t know exactly what she was congratulating him for\u2014not hiding in a corridor, not obeying a uniform that wasn\u2019t uniform enough\u2014but took it and tucked it where he kept other small medals, the ones that didn\u2019t shine in rooms with lights.\n\nLater, when the evening had tucked itself back in and the audience had been told that they were heroes for waiting, he found himself back under the kind light answering the public\u2019s applause as if shaking hands. The hood at the seam did not return; or if it did, it behaved better. The judges said their programmed lines with sincerity that may have been learned or may have been honest; it didn\u2019t matter because the shape of the sentences fit the shape of his day. Backstage, people were kind with their mouths and their hands and the little jokes that keep fear from turning feral. A runner handed him a phone and said, \u201cMom,\u201d as if that were a role in the script. He pressed it to his ear and her breath came first, then his name, then that small sound she made when she didn\u2019t want to cry but her body had decided to participate in the conversation. He didn\u2019t tell her about the corridor or the man with the blue that was not blue; he told her that the river had threatened to be beautiful at dusk and that a boy had declared him a dragon and that London was a place where oranges cost too much but tasted the same. She told him that Auntie Mavis had instructed three men and the dog to clap at the TV and that they had clapped until the dog sneezed. He heard voices in the background. He closed his eyes for a second at the sound of his name traveling across water and wires without losing letters.\n\nHe walked back to the hotel in a small group because cities are always better when you share their boredom with people who are not boring. The night was a color he couldn\u2019t name in English and didn\u2019t need to. Neon turned puddles into small trapped futures you could step over. He stopped at a shop that had flowers out front as if ready for a funeral or a seduction and bought a single orange, because that was how you kept promises across continents: one small citrus sphere carried in a pocket like intention. The man behind the till said something that had too many vowels to catch, and he nodded the way you nod when you don\u2019t need to understand to be polite.\n\nIn the lobby, a new face at reception looked up with the eager exhaustion of someone on their second week at a job that had already taught them too much about people. \u201cPost,\u201d she said brightly, gathering an envelope from under the counter. He took it because envelopes in lobbies are like questions in church; you accept them even when you know they\u2019ll be about tithes. In the lift he examined the handwriting. It had made an effort, like someone dressing up to go to the shops. Inside, there was hotel paper with a letter pressed into at the top with the dignity of logos. Thank you for staying, it said, in printed words. On the second page, a note in polite pen: Please find enclosed a complimentary pass for our spa\u2014a gift from management. The pass was a rectangle with a little shimmer along its edge, embossed. Tucked behind it, neat and cheap, a plaster, the exact kind stocked in all rooms everywhere for people who open stubborn suitcases with thumbnails and pay the price. He found himself laughing, an involuntary soft bark, not at the mysteriousness of it anymore but at the audacity of hotel generosity: they were trying to fix the world of messages and hoods with a rectangle that would keep a scratch from hairline to chin. He set it on the bedside table like a coin on a shrine, not to worship it but to keep his eye trained to what was ridiculous so he did not drown in what was not.\n\nHe bathed because hot water had been invented for men who felt the city on them like dust. He slid under until his ears went under and the room changed from hotel to ocean, muffled and steady and ancient. He held his breath not to practice but to remember. He felt the hotel around him anyway\u2014the elevator\u2019s cable hum through his bones, the steps of a person in heels in the corridor, the far-away argument of two men who had decided to spit their tired at each other. He thought of the pool at home with its blue that had been dropped into their neighbourhood like a promise and the way Mister Choi would sweep dust at dawn as if beginnings were a floor you could clean. He saw, despite the water over his eyes, his mother closing the door on elders, his aunt feeding a whole street with three chickens because numbers in a pot don\u2019t always obey math, Bongani rolling his eyes so hard they crossed the border and came back with news.\n\nHe surfaced and the bathroom gave his face back to him in sections, fog having smudged the mirror the way shame smudges teenage years. He wiped a circle into the steam and looked at his mouth, at the corners that liked to go up when trouble knocked because smiling had kept him from offending men with sticks when he was younger. He thought of a sentence he would never say on TV because it sounded like a small act trying to be philosophy: your breath is not a commodity. He patted himself dry like a man who had learned to be kind to this particular collection of skin. He slid the elastic onto his wrist and felt the old mark grin. He lay on the bed with the orange in his palm and made himself choose rest over scrolling, because scrolling was a door that never learned to stop opening.\n\nSometime after he had auditioned sleep, a set of teenage girls in the room above decided to make memories by dragging a chair across a wooden floor, then dragging it back, and then shrieking with the unfiltered joy of people whose lives were still primarily about being bodies. He grinned into the pillow because a person could hate that noise in one life and love it in another. His phone blinked once on the bedside table, modest as an eyelash. He reached and saw a message from a number that was not blue-lanyard but was also not the shepherd\u2019s rehearsed politeness. It was from the boy\u2019s aunt, her name saved now that she had completed the ceremony of letting a child approach a stranger. Thank you, it read, for the drawing on your mirror. He slept because gratitude is a hand on the back, too, because a boy had declared him dragon, because his mother had oranges stacked like prayers that didn\u2019t bruise.\n\nIn the morning he woke to rain that didn\u2019t believe it had to commit. It tapped the window like a neighbor trying to see if you were home. He peeled the plaster from the table, turned it in his fingers until the adhesive flashed dull, and stuck it on the inside of his left forearm like a child sticking a sticker on a school book. He looked at it and laughed quietly. If anything asked him to show a pass at a door he did not trust, he would show them his arm. He would say see, I have been marked by the ridiculous, and in the space where ridicule lives, perhaps danger would be confused enough to miss its step. He went downstairs to breakfast, to eggs and bread and love called by strangers, to a day that had already put its boots on. He chewed and counted and planned to walk to the river in the part of the morning when the city enjoyed being ugly. He texted Bongani the picture of the plaster on his arm and wrote only: please tell Auntie I have been vaccinated against nonsense. Bongani\u2019s reply came swift and savage and holy: Nonsense is airborne. Do not breathe with your mouth open.\n\nAt the pool later, the water did not remember him but was glad to see him anyway. He joined it like a person returning to a language they learned first. The lifeguard raised his chin in their ritual of men who pretend speech isn\u2019t necessary, and the window on the other side of the bench held only its reflections: him, blue, a moving rectangle of quiet. He let himself go under longer than a sensible man would before breakfast, to keep from becoming a man who listens for the knock when there isn\u2019t one. Under, the world made sense in a way that would never be possible on a stage, and when he came up he wiped his face with a towel that smelled faintly of a stranger\u2019s soap and told himself out loud a sentence that would make sense nowhere else: water doesn\u2019t lie, and neither will I. He listened to the way the roof echoed his voice back, a soft rebellion, and then swam a lazy length that could convince even a city to unclench its teeth.\n\nBy the time he reached the hotel again, it had learned his footstep. The woman at the desk waved like a teacher who had decided to become a friend. Someone had left a small parcel the size and shape of a book, wrapped in brown paper that had been used twice. He took it up, not heavy enough to be dangerous. Inside, a book indeed, the cover blue not silver, the title something earnest about breath and art written in a font that trusted itself too much, and on the flyleaf a message in a handwriting that had forgotten how to be shy: For when the room asks you to be smaller. Signed with a name he did not recognize and a phone number that promised nothing. He held it and wanted to write a letter to books, to tell them that their generosity could embarrass a human. He put it on the bedside table next to the plaster, next to the orange now flattened into an absence that smelled like time, next to the old elastic that had become a wrist\u2019s repetitive prayer. He sat and let London continue its solo outside, that relentless quiet-loud that made people fall in love with it and say they hated it in the same breath. He took a deep breath because his lungs still belonged solely to him. He exhaled and watched the window fog and clear, fog and clear, like the city practicing how to see him and how to forget. He would learn to do the same. He would learn to be seen as a man in a rectangle of water and then as a man at a bus stop and then as a man in a kitchen in Pretoria eating stew large enough to name. He would learn to be boring when boredom saved lives, and to be extraordinary when light asked nicely, and to be no one at all when men with hoods chose seams. He lay back and let the day kneel and ask his permission to come in. He let it. He promised himself, like a man changing a habit on a Monday, that he would not leave anyone behind in any corridor that could be rearranged into a trap. He promised the river he would listen even when it only wanted to complain. He promised the boy with the dragon drawing that he would keep making rooms where breath could be a sport and not a currency. He closed his eyes and for the first time since the plane had convinced itself it was a bird, he slept without choosing it.",

                              "content": "Chapter 8\n\nThe day after the day that had tried on three different names and kept them all, London behaved like a kettle at ninety-three degrees, close to boiling and not committing. Kabelo woke with his mouth tasting faintly of metal and triumph and other people\u2019s microphones. He lay still and told his lungs that they had done enough and could have the morning off if they wanted, and they responded by doing what they always did, which was keep him alive without asking for thanks. For a few seconds he couldn\u2019t place the hum in the room\u2014lift cables, air vent, a neighbor\u2019s hairdryer making an argument of air\u2014and then the shape of the night before slotted in and his chest did that private skip that was somewhere between laughter and suspicion. He glanced at the orange peel on the bedside table, cupped like a small boat after the passenger has stood and stepped onto land, and he felt the ridiculous happiness of someone who had done one thing, exactly the thing he had said he would, and had not been stolen by a door in the process.\n\nHe ate breakfast as if breakfast had been a friend before the lights remembered him. He kept his head down over eggs assisted by a salt that did not quite know how to salute and a toast that insisted on its job. The waitress called him love again and he let the word sit in his ear and warm its hands. His phone had developed the particular frenzy that follows television, and he scrolled until he recognized the signs of a brain being asked to be a host for a parade. If he kept looking at people\u2019s love he would lose the ability to recognize any other kind. He put it face down and talked out loud to his fork and the fork agreed: if the day wanted to borrow him, the terms would be printed larger than last time.\n\nAt the theatre the air had learned his name better. People remembered him between coffee and cables and their mouths did small things, the corners lifting in muscle memory. A producer had an itinerary that made noon feel like a threatening stranger. Media wanted a piece of his breath that did not belong to them: a radio spot where a man with an accent that had been to private school twice would ask him what he had meant by his skin under water; a daytime panel where women with hair that obeyed them would nod and say brave like they were discussing a color. He wouldn\u2019t say no to all of it because no is a door too, but he had started noticing the particular chill that arrives when your mouth is doing a different job to your body. If there was a choice between a curtain and water, he would still choose water because water didn\u2019t ask you to become its advertisement.\n\nThe unknown thread on his phone had learned a lesson, or it wanted him to believe it had. It sulked in silence, replaced by the honest aggression of tabloids who wanted to frame him with stock phrases\u2014overnight sensation, township talent, young man swims against the tide\u2014and the more expensive attention of a heritage magazine eager to claim him as something poetic and necessary. There was a voicemail with an American accent that rolled its r\u2019s like marbles, offering representation and a three-minute consult because talent windows were brief and culture moves to New York if you let it. Eleanor skimmed the day\u2019s obligations with that look she had, as if she had learned chess on a board with every square trying to burn her. \u201cWe\u2019ll ration you,\u201d she said, the way people in drought say water, and he nodded because rationing had been his first sport.\n\nThe little boy\u2019s drawing stayed on the mirror even after housekeeping had been, its blue stubbornness a compass point. He put on his cap for a second in the room, ridiculous and perfect, the elastic snapping against the same wrist it had known since it started its service. The plaster he\u2019d stuck to his forearm the night before was holding but its edge had begun to peel, forming a tiny mouth as if the sticker wanted to tell him a joke he would not like. He pressed the corner down the way a father would press a child\u2019s cowlick, firm and pointless. He told himself the absurdity of that square was his amulet and then made himself stop believing in amulets because amulets were just other people\u2019s systems disguised as kindness.\n\nHe crossed the river on foot because you should always apologize to water after asking it to behave on television. The air had that clear cold that makes your teeth feel newly grown. He leaned on a small patch of railing that had gathered initials in black marker, declarations that T loves V and K was here and someone had drawn a heart that looked like two potatoes kissing. He freed his breath in a long stream and watched it leave him. Across the way a busker who might have been the same woman from before or a cousin of her determination tuned a guitar with the intensity of a surgeon deciding how much to cut. She saw his hand on the railing and gave him a nod that in this city counted as intimacy. \u201cYou look like the inside of a matchbox,\u201d she said, humor in the scarf of her voice. He laughed and pointed to his forearm. \u201cI have my vaccination,\u201d he said, and showed her the plaster. She kicked a boot against the case with coins and made a sound that was almost a cough. \u201cWe\u2019re all marked,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of us choose the sticker. Some of us are given one and then pretend it\u2019s jewelry.\u201d\n\nHe got back to the theatre early because being early was also a ritual against theft. In the green room, twins sparkled in daylight like sequins that had been told to be serious. The woman in the wheelchair and her mouth full of jokes she had now spent raised a toast with a paper cup of water and said, \u201cIf we all win, do we have to split the prize into cousins?\u201d and the room did its gentle laugh. The boy with the invisible piano had slept exactly three hours and announced it like a weather report. Paul read out the running order like the names of saints and reminded them their job was to remind the audience they had lungs.\n\nThere was a meeting with the people who found advertising money. It was held in a small room where the furniture had been designed to encourage agreement. A man in a jacket that had been fitted by someone who did not like him very much said he saw brand partnerships for him, partnerships built around athletic fabrics and bottled liquids with names that sounded like machines. Kabelo nodded as if he were listening to a sermon he could not afford to stand up during. The man used phrases that had numbers in them\u2014market capture, cross-platform\u2014and not once did he say the word water. Eleanor sat slightly behind him with the attentive stillness of someone who would not let the world put a bill on the table and then move the salt so you couldn\u2019t reach it. When they left, she said, \u201cWe can let some of them love you. We don\u2019t have to adopt their parents.\u201d He grinned because metaphors were how he spent money on kindness.\n\nIt was in the corridor by the props department that he saw her again, the woman of the clipboard species, hair tied back like a woman who refuses the wind. She had changed her coat for one without a belt but she remained a loyal servant of beige. Her lanyard was inside her blouse as if it were a modesty. She was speaking to a man who could have been a driver or a stagehand or someone pretending to be both, and as she tilted her head he caught the edge of adhesive at her neck again, the tiny dull square like a lie that had achieved statehood. He lowered his eyes because staring is its own permission, and he kept walking until the corridor returned to being a corridor and not a trial. He didn\u2019t tell Eleanor because he was tired of making shapes out of plaster squares when whole men in hoods had tried to shepherd him like a stubborn sheep. He saved it for later like you save bone broth for a day your body insists on soup.\n\nPretoria did not wait for permission to be part of the day. Between rehearsal and a bland sandwich that was doing its best, his mother called. She had timed it as if she had pressed her ear to the universe and listened for a silence big enough to fit her voice. \u201cThey came yesterday,\u201d she said without greeting, and he could hear Auntie Mavis clucking in the background like a hen with opinions. \u201cMen from a\u2026 a foundation. They said they could help you manage the pressure. They said your bank must be strong for your dreams to rest on it. I told them we keep our money under the kettle. They laughed and then they stopped laughing when I kept looking at them. One had a plaster on the neck like he cut himself shaving air. Mavis chased them with a wooden spoon that has discipline.\u201d Auntie Mavis\u2019s voice came in loud without asking; at some point she had learned how to make phones obey. \u201cTell London I am not scared of its little angels. I will introduce them to the broom. Also, your face looked nice on the TV. You looked like you were praying without being shy. Our street is full of noise about you. Mister Choi put your picture next to the cigarettes and said we must all stop smoking for two days in your honor. I told him I would stop for two hours because I am sensible.\u201d He laughed and put his laughter carefully where it wouldn\u2019t spill. He told them he loved them and to keep the door locks as useful, and his mother made him say the words twice in Setswana so the house could agree to be strong.\n\nSecurity tweaked their plan with that brisk British acceptance of inconvenience, the way a butler might sigh and nonetheless find your scarf. No sheep through the loading bay, no unshepherded staff exits; they would take the most public of doors, cameras and all, because anonymity had been painted with a target. He signed the paper that said he had been advised not to be foolish and initialed the places that admitted he would forget and try to be polite at an unwise moment. The unknown number had tried one more time with a new attachment\u2014a PDF wearing a government font offering \u201cexpedited cultural clearance\u201d\u2014and he sent it to Eleanor, who forwarded it to a number saved in her phone as HN, which he later learned meant a detective with boring shoes. The reply came back with a promptness that felt like a personal favor. Known actors, it read. Disposal recommended. He disposed of it by taking it out to the bridge and holding the screen up to the light and then deleting it while watching the river pretend to applaud with its brown hands. It didn\u2019t make the pride in him smaller to do that. It redistributed it.\n\nHe took his nap like a businessman on an airplane, upright but determined. Dreamless would have been a blessing; instead his brain rolled out a mat for a fragment: a door with blue paint flaking, a hand knocking with the confident rhythm of someone who had paid for the right, his mother\u2019s broom lifting to become a kind of stick that shepherds and men with hoods had underestimated. He woke with his heart in his neck and calmed it with the sort of deep breaths that had earned him his right to be here.\n\nThe results show had its own feral energy. The audience came pre-charged with their voting choices like a congregation that arrived with its amens tallied. The hosts did their harmless mischief with the relish of men who had found a way to stay boys, and the judges applied their faces like make-up, eyes warm and glittering and trained. He stood in his mark under the polite heat and felt the word finalist sit inside him like an old auntie settling on a couch, full of commentary. It mattered and it did not, and he did not know how to make the two truths hold hands without one squeezing the other\u2019s knuckles too hard. He had seen other rooms where a vote could change a life and had learned to put a hat under his heart when it rained.\n\nHe had one trick left that belonged to him and not to the show. Before the lid closed on the tank the night before, while the crew checked their latches and their safety signs and Ross counted three things twice, he had asked a question so small he almost didn\u2019t recognize his own voice. Could he write something on the inside. Ross had blinked as if asked a question about poetry while holding a wrench. Use the grease pencil for marks, he\u2019d said, if you must. Cameras might not catch it unless they kiss the glass. He had written nothing then because writing for a rehearsal is like eating for a photograph. But now, results night where the narrative wanted to own him, he slipped a hand to the lip of the tank and palmed the stub of the pencil like a boy swapping sweets at the back of a class. He leaned forward and, under the flare of the audience lights that reflected his silver into matter and story, he printed three words backward so the front would read right. They were not clever. They were not the kind of words that would make a producer clap. They said: I CHOOSE AIR. It was a joke if you wanted it to be, a tautology, a swimmer doing a love letter to oxygen. It was also the whole thing. If anyone with a camera saw it, if anyone at home paused their broadcast, if a boy with a dragon on printer paper caught it and made it part of his rules, then it would carry like a paper boat sometimes does in a storm, farther than its size promises.\n\nWhen the envelope was torn and the wrong name became a right one for somebody else, he was surprised at how exactly he had prepared for that sound. It had the same pitch as morning disappointment, the little fall your stomach does when you open the fridge and remember you forgot to buy milk. Then the applause rose like a solution in search of a problem and the hosts said his name the way good men say names when they need to be kind, and the other finalists touched his shoulder as if he were already a ghost and needed to be reminded of his outline. The woman in the wheelchair who had made more jokes in twenty-four hours than some people make in a life rolled up and said through a grin that did not ask to be believed, \u201cThey are wrong exactly the right amount,\u201d and he believed her because he wanted to and because she carried a may you in a mouth that didn\u2019t owe you anything.\n\nHe smiled with his mouth for the cameras and didn\u2019t sell his eyes. He said the sentences that keep you inside the building until your paperwork is stamped and you have your own name back. He did not swallow disappointment because swallowing is what makes it grow. He stood in it like a puddle and then stepped out because cold water is an old friend. Eleanor\u2019s hand found his shoulder blade the precise way a coach\u2019s hand had once found the place his mother had said had no name in English. \u201cWe\u2019re going to walk through the front,\u201d she said chirp-bright for anyone listening, and under it a river: stay with me now. He stayed.\n\nThe lobby, with its marble pretending to be more honest than it was, had gathered fans like a kitchen gathers cousins. Signs with names hand-lettered in the sleepy love of teenagers, phones lifted like bright starlings, the crackle that happens when people want something and are trying to be nice while wanting it. He stopped for one picture, then two, then three, each with a person whose face he would forget and whose story he would carry anyway, because that is how this business breaks or doesn\u2019t. He said water doesn\u2019t lie to a woman who had cried already and then laughed at herself, she said it back to him as if it were scripture, and for a minute the world had sorted itself into orderly shelves.\n\nThe man with the hood had learned a new costume. He was a man with a cap this time, its brim low enough to make a line where a face should have been. He had the posture of a person who knew the trick of looking like he belonged to the building and he had the patience of a man standing at a bus stop he had set on fire himself. Eleanor did a calculation without using her hands. She altered their path by a meter as if it were a choreography, and the blue lanyards did a small tidal thing without anyone admitting to it. The man did not move toward them but made a small pivot which in certain neighborhoods meant we\u2019ll try later. The plaster on Kabelo\u2019s forearm caught the light as he waved at a girl who had turned eleven specifically to be here, and he felt ridiculous and invincible and loved and hunted and it made him want to run and to stand still at the same time. He left by the front door that had more faces than brick and felt the night greet him as if relieved he had not decided to be a story for other men\u2019s dinner tables.\n\nBack in the cocoon of the car that smelled faintly of ambition and cleaning chemicals, he allowed his head to drop back against the seat. A laugh escaped him at a volume too low to have ambitions. \u201cDid you see it,\u201d he asked Eleanor without turning to look, and she asked what she was supposed to have seen in a voice that had paid taxes. \u201cI wrote on the tank,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the inside. I wrote I choose air.\u201d She made the sound English women make when they approve of a dress in a shop window they cannot afford, a small exhale with mischief in it. \u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cBuy what you want when the lights are asking you to model their taste.\u201d\n\nAt the hotel there was a note for him that made his shoulder muscles pull together before he read it: a card with the detective\u2019s neat handwriting\u2014HN\u2014telling him that men who call themselves shepherds have been arrested twice in this city and keep learning nothing, that vigilance is another kind of cardio, that they had appreciated his being boring. It included a number he could call if asked to explain himself at a border or a lobby. Behind it, as if the world could not resist its own jokes, a small square of plaster was tucked in by somebody with an administrative sense of humor. He put the whole set under the orange peel and told himself he would not talk to inanimate things in a city that had learned to talk back.\n\nHe phoned Bongani because Bongani was the person to call when words needed oil. The line limped and then found its feet. \u201cYou were a miracle with muscles,\u201d Bongani said, and Kabelo had decided to love him forever from the second grade and this confirmed it. \u201cThey didn\u2019t let the right one win because when will they, but you did not drown, which was my only request. Auntie says the boy who drew the dragon has started charging people two rand to look at his paper and he keeps saying, \u2018I am under but I can breathe.\u2019 I told him to raise his price because he is part of capitalism now. Also a man in a cap came back to the garage and the dog bit his shoe like a politician. We all watched and no one helped because sometimes ethics restart themselves without your permission. Tell London if it tries to swallow you we will make that river spit.\u201d Kabelo laughed until his sides warned him gently. He told him he would be home soon enough to be laughed at properly in a garage where men knew how to make jokes stick to the floor.\n\nSleep came like a favor the third night, unsummoned and well-behaved. He put his hand flat on his chest and thought of the Johannesburg-to-Pretoria trains that used to keep time and of the robot near the spaza shop that had never learned the meaning of punctuality. He surrendered to the building\u2019s hum and for once it did not negotiate. He dreamed the most ordinary thing his brain could manage: warm water; his mother washing rice in a pot until the starch rinsed away and the water ran true.\n\nHe did the boring things afterward because boring had saved his skin. He let the show\u2019s press officer walk him through the corridor where photographers waited to tell him to turn his head slightly right. He sat in a small office with a legal pad in front of him and signed his name to a contract that said he could use the footage of himself without being charged for this act of generosity. He ate a sandwich whose only miracle was how efficiently it moved along. He went to the baths one last evening and swam lengths until a tenderness appeared between his shoulder blades and asked to be named. He sat in the steam room and listened to men breathe like engines, the way men share silence like money without saying what their fathers did with their fists. He walked in the rain without his hood like a man who had chosen what he would be wet from. He went into a shop and bought three cheap postcards with London printed in fonts with illusions about themselves, and he wrote each one to people who would not care about fonts: Auntie Mavis, Bongani, his mother who would keep hers in a Bible until the Bible stopped being a book and became a storage unit for important paper.\n\nTwo days later he packed the suitcase properly, not like a man on the run but like a person ending one room and choosing another. He put the plaster in the bottom of the bag between underpants and stubborn socks. He rolled the blue cap careful and placed it between shirts like a truth too fragile to be at the top. He looked around the room and tried to leave it the way you leave a room when you know it belongs to a person who might never know you were here. He went down to the lobby and the man with the closed-cupboard face said his name without error and wished him another kind of luck. The woman with the eager exhaustion of second week at a job waved and made a heart with her hands that she then pretended she had not made. He wanted to tell them all a secret about water that would turn their day into a better version of itself and then he kept it because not all gifts are gifts if they are given when the receiver is not hungry.\n\nAt the airport he did the dance of shoes and belts and liquids like a person who has been taught a new religion and has decided to be a quiet respectful believer. A security officer with a bun so disciplined it could be a proverb looked at his passport and then at his face and said, \u201cLoved you on telly,\u201d in a voice that had been taught not to love anyone. He thanked her and she let the corner of her mouth admit to a childhood. He waited at the gate with his bag held between his feet like a pet that might run, and he watched people watching planes and he thought the thought people think in that place\u2014what is the air like over there\u2014and he answered himself like a clever child\u2014same air, different mess.\n\nOn the plane he took the window again because greed can be holy when you know it. He texted his mother that he was boarding and she sent back three words: we are boiling. He smiled because this meant water on the stove and tea and a house ready to receive a son and possibly chicken if the electricity was friendly. He put his phone on airplane mode with a flourish as if it had been a rebellious teenager and he had won. He smoothed the elastic on his wrist like a man teaching his own heart how to obey. He closed his eyes before the lift and opened them at the tilt that makes your stomach remind you of your animal. He watched the city flatten and then blur and then go away in the way cities never do in your chest. He took his breath and gave it back and took it again as if practicing for older age.\n\nLanding felt like a memory being returned. The air smelled like a question you can answer. Pretoria had arranged its heat as a challenge and a blessing. The birds along Nelson Mandela Drive were at it, the old fight, the sky a complicity of blue. He came through the small airport with the confidence of someone who had already been loved far away and found that love did not give him a new passport to his own rooms. He saw his mother\u2019s mouth before he saw her whole, lips already forming his name for the third time, the way you say a prayer three times not because God is deaf but because repetition is how your own bone believes you. He let her put her hand on his face, that palm with the map of everything on it. He leaned into it as if there were any other religion worth practicing.\n\nAt home the kettle was indeed boiling and Auntie Mavis had flavoured the entire house with a pot that thought it was a history book. Bongani appeared with a grin that made two men jealous and pushed a box at him with the pride of a man who has saved carefully. Inside were goggles the color of petrol rainbows, new enough to smell of factory and regret. \u201cFor when your old elastic finally admits it needs to retire,\u201d he said, and Kabelo laughed because men like them had always been bad at goodbyes and excellent at buying items that said the unsayable. He took the elastic from his wrist and held it between finger and thumb like a relic and then slid it back on because you do not retire faith even when you have a new church.\n\nLater, much later, after stories had been put on the table like salted things and eaten, after Mister Choi had come in with a newspaper clipping that managed to both misquote and love him, after the neighbor\u2019s dog had sat on the stoep exactly where a dog sits when it thinks it is a prophet, after a small girl from up the street had tried to sell him four stones she had declared lucky so she could buy a lollipop, he took himself to the municipal pool because the water had not been allowed a say in this day. He walked there in the late afternoon when the sun decides to be kind to cheeks. The guard at the gate greeted him with the name he had been given at birth and not the one the street had tried to stick to his forehead, and that made a small part of him evaporate and return as rain. Inside the fence the grass did what it always did, and the water lay there like a patient in a good mood. He stripped in the change room that had always smelled like other people\u2019s lives and he put on the blue cap that did not tell stories about the globe. He slid in and the pool climbed him like a beloved who had not been jealous. He pushed off, arms spearing forward, the old drill in his bones, the Pretorian Serpent uncoiling with a certainty that made him feel like a road was being drawn under him.\n\nHe counted laps and then refused to count them. He held his breath until the edges of the world fuzzed slightly and then he did the ridiculous\u2014the thing no medic would sign off: he did one more beat, not for television, not for applause, not for lists and lanyards, but because the water asked and because he knew how to say yes to it. He came up and laughed, the kind of small dumb sound people in love make when they are alone. At the shallow end a boy in a Kaizer Chiefs jersey with shoulders sharp with future stared at him like a reporter. \u201cYou are the one on TV,\u201d he said, not as a question. \u201cSometimes,\u201d Kabelo answered, not to be difficult but because sometimes is the closest the truth lets you come without wearing out. The boy considered this and nodded, as if learning a formula. \u201cI am going to be something else,\u201d he said. \u201cI am going to do it inside air.\u201d Kabelo wanted to hug him and didn\u2019t because men like him were watched differently in pools. He said instead, \u201cGood. The air here is full of us. There is room.\u201d The boy smiled without moving his mouth, and when he turned to go he slipped on the wet concrete and did that stumbling dance all humans do, and caught himself, and pretended he had meant the whole thing.\n\nOn the way home he passed the jacaranda that still hadn\u2019t decided. The robot at the corner flirted with indecision and then chose. The white Quantum idled in the way of Quantums. The world had changed and had not, and he felt the weight of both the way you feel a towel on your shoulders: heavy until it does its job and then you don\u2019t notice it until you are cold again. At the stoep he sat with his mother and Auntie Mavis and the dog and whoever else had decided their feet needed a place to point. He told them about the river that gives advice no one asked for and the woman who believed dragons should be taken seriously and the way doors in London require you to know yourself quickly. Auntie Mavis cracked bones between her teeth with pleasure and said, \u201cWhat I want to know is, did you bring me biscuits that know their own mind.\u201d He went into his bag and produced the tin he had almost forgotten, fancy and foolish, and she held it like a trophy, and he told himself that whatever the show had chosen and whatever the shepherds would try, he had acquired the only prize that made sense, which was the ability to come back to a place that could love him and tell him when he was being stupid.\n\nHe slept that night without dreaming, or if he dreamed he did not remember, which is the body\u2019s best gift. In the morning he woke to water in the tap that burped and then ran right, and he thought of writing letters to the pool at Ironmonger Row and to Eleanor and to the detective with the boring shoes and to the boy with the dragon and to the river, but letters are a luxury in a house where the kettle whistles a schedule. He put the new goggles around his wrist and they made a mark that did not hurt, and he thought perhaps some marks don\u2019t understand borders because some skins are very old, older than passports, older than lanyards, older than men with hoods who love seams. He thought of the words on the tank and how they were both defiance and truism, and he said them again in a kitchen that did not need them to explain anything. He chose air. He chose water. He chose to learn which doors were doors and which were traps that had learned to speak. He stepped outside into a morning that had forgotten television and remembered bread. He walked, and the city, his city, walked with him like a twin.",

Somewhere down the street a man tuned a car by listening to it the way a choir master listens to altos. Children tried new insults on one another and rolled the words in their mouths like marbles to see if they cracked teeth. Power went and came as if it had been invited to a party it didn\u2019t really want to attend but was too polite to ignore. Kabelo lay on his back on the cool patch of the floor where the tiles remembered being clay and stitched a plan together with the stubborn thread of someone who had done a big thing far away and decided not to let it be the only thing. The plan was boring in the way he had learned to revere: ask the municipality for the hall by the pool on Saturdays; convince Mister Choi to allow a notice on his spaza door without charging advertising rates; find someone with a printer; convince the lifeguard whose name he still didn\u2019t know to allow drills that weren\u2019t on the laminated rules. He imagined the words on paper: Breath School, free for anyone with lungs, donations in oranges accepted. He smiled because oranges had become a family superstition and who was he to disrespect a fruit with that much history.\n\nHis mother watched him with the tact of a woman who has raised ambition before and seen it burn and seen it bake bread. \u201cYou will do it slowly,\u201d she said, as if the sentence were a chair he could sit on. \u201cYou will not let other people\u2019s stories borrow your lungs.\u201d She bundled her scarf in her lap like she was holding a small animal too proud to be petted in front of others. When he told her he wanted to put his name on a notice she pursed her lips and then unwound them from their disapproval. \u201cWrite your name small,\u201d she advised, \u201cand write your times big. People love a time more than a man.\u201d He kissed her cheek because he didn\u2019t know any other ritual that did the job as reliably. Outside, a gull that had wandered too far inland argued with a miner bird, and the sky negotiated on their behalf.\n\nAt the municipal office, the woman behind the counter had a stamp that sounded like it had a personality. It thudded paper with the gravitas of a drum in a church that doesn\u2019t allow dancing. She asked him why he needed the hall and he said because breathing is catching and he wanted to help it spread, and she looked at him over the top of her glasses with the exact expression his primary school teacher had worn when he\u2019d told her he could see numbers in the air. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a category for breath,\u201d she said, not unkindly, and slid him a form that required him to choose between cultural, sporting, religious, or other, the box for other as small as the city\u2019s imagination could afford. He ticked other with an insistence that made his pen threaten to go through the page and wrote in block letters: Water Safety / Community Wellness. She stamped and stamped and then stamped again for good luck, and when she handed him back the papers she said, as if a thought had slipped past her guard, \u201cMy boy is scared of the deep end like it owes him money. You think you could convince him to be in the same room as it without crying?\u201d He nodded and tried to make his yes large enough to fit a child and his mother and the stamp. The woman smiled and her mouth remembered how.\n\nBack at the pool, the lifeguard looked at the paper as if bureaucracy were a species of fish he\u2019d never learned how to scale. He was a square man who stood like a door that had never known how to slam. \u201cNo stunts,\u201d he said, as if reading a sentence off a tiled wall. \u201cNo going under for showing off. No making fathers think they must call the ambulance so they can be heroes in front of their sons.\u201d Kabelo promised what he could promise, which was that he would teach lungs to be patient and bodies to be boring on purpose. He felt the slow shift in the man, the way acceptance sometimes arrives disguised as apathy. \u201cSaturday,\u201d the lifeguard allowed, pointing his whistle like a conductor\u2019s baton, \u201conly after the school crowd goes and before the men with bellies come to stand in the shallow end and talk about Bafana Bafana.\u201d It was a window so tight a hand would barely fit, but he had learned in London how to slip through spaces that thought they weren\u2019t doors.\n\nBongani turned up with a stack of flyers still warm from the machine at the copy shop that had spent a decade promising to upgrade its printers. He held them like a man holding a newborn, careful not to smudge because the ink had not yet committed to its life. \u201cLook at you,\u201d he said, full of pride that liked to wear jokes. \u201cMr. Air. Mister Air Rights. Mister Please Sit With Your Back Straight and Count To Ten.\u201d He read the text out loud with that performative solemnity he used when pretending to be an elder at a funeral. \u201cBreath School. Saturdays. You come with your lungs and a towel, we bring the rest.\u201d He lowered the page and raised an eyebrow. \u201cAre you promising snacks?\u201d Kabelo laughed and shook his head. \u201cOranges,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are a citrus-based organization. Auntie Mavis is chairlady of procurement.\u201d They took the flyers to Mister Choi, who allowed the notice to go under the cigarettes and over the gum with a little bow. \u201cFor you, discount,\u201d he said, and then, because business is business, charged them full price for the pack of cooldrinks.\n\nThe first Saturday, three kids came as if they had been dared. They had the look boys get when they enter a space that has not yet decided whether to love them: chin up, eyes hard, shirt held by two fingers because a mother in a hurry had not tucked it in. A girl came too, late, with plaits so tight they told of an aunt\u2019s ambition and a look that could shame sun. Her mother stood by the fence in a skirt that remembered different kinds of work and watched with her face, the rest of her body storing reactions for later. Kabelo had rehearsed the speech, of course he had, but in the moment he let it go in favor of the truth standing in front of him. \u201cWe are going to learn to be friends with the part of water that is not here,\u201d he said, gesturing to their chests. \u201cWe are going to teach the part of you that panics to sit down. We are going to clap for each other when we do difficult things. We are going to stop when we get stupid.\u201d The boy in the middle snorted and tried on a yawn like a jacket. \u201cI can hold my breath until my cousin fetches a whip,\u201d he bragged. Kabelo smiled and made his smile hard work to look at. \u201cThen you can learn to stop before the whip comes,\u201d he said, and saw that land in the boy\u2019s shoulders.\n\nHe put them through the silly things first: blowing bubbles, naming each bubble after a thing you didn\u2019t want to keep\u2014fear, uncle, darkness, tight shoes\u2014and counting the beats between breath and thought. He showed them how to float without surrender, the way a body can remember it was made inside water once. They laughed at first the way children laugh when you ask them to do something they think lives in a baby\u2019s book. Then the water did what water does, which is put hands on spines without permission and teach. The girl with the plaits closed her eyes of her own accord and Marco, the lifeguard whose name finally revealed itself reluctantly through a joke and a spill of tea, took one step closer just in case. For a half second she panicked because panic is loyal, then she remembered the counting and the counting called her back, and when she stood and wiped her face with the heel of her hand, she looked at him like a person who has opened a secret door inside their body and found a room they will keep to themselves for a while. The mothers at the fence did that non-clapping that women do for their own, the noise in the throat disguised as clearing it. Auntie Mavis, who had appointed herself to walk the perimeter as if other people\u2019s children were inevitably trying to escape, pretended not to look proud and failed.\n\nWord did what it does when it wants to live. By the third Saturday, there were ten, then twenty, a trickle in the shallow end that threatened to become a river. A boy with a burn scar along his forearm like a map of a country no one wanted arrived and refused to take off his T-shirt. Kabelo agreed before he was done asking, because dignity has a speed. A teenager with soft eyes who had learned to make his shoulders a story showed up and asked if he could sit and watch until sitting loosened its grip enough for him to slide in. A grandmother came with two little boys whom she kept correcting in a whisper even when they were silent. \u201cWe will learn to sing underwater,\u201d she muttered under her breath, \u201csince above water the world has gone deaf.\u201d He wrote down names like a collector of comets and learned faces in case someone needed him to remember them later in a corridor. Mister Choi sent a bag of oranges with a note that said, primitively and perfectly, for lungs, and Auntie Mavis carved peels into spirals like party decorations and made the pool smell briefly like a grove.\n\nWhat he did not plan for arrived anyway, because the city respects no calendar. A man in a tight shirt with a charity\u2019s logo that had been designed with words like hope and uplift in mind turned up with a clipboard and the polite smile of someone who has learned to extract signatures the way other people learn to pull weeds. He praised the program in tones that made praise feel like a receipt. He said his foundation could help with documentation for those children who wanted to compete internationally, and if they signed here and here, the network could try them in Johannesburg, in Lagos, in London, in places where talent could be a bridge. He used the words shepherd and pathway as if they were synonyms. He had a plaster on his neck, the small square dull at the edges. Bongani, who had decided to wear a reflective vest for no reason other than to feel official, stepped between him and the fence with the casual majesty of a traffic cone. \u201cThe only thing we are signing here is the register for oranges,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is your organization registered as when you go home and you take off your nice T-shirt?\u201d The man\u2019s smile adjusted but did not break; it had been trained. He held up his clipboard in a way that made it look like a shield. \u201cWe\u2019re on the radio,\u201d he said, as if that were a permit. \u201cThere is a caravan parked two streets away where we can explain this better to mothers who are too busy to stand in the sun. We have a refrigerator.\u201d\n\nKabelo felt the old cold along his neck, that ghost of a child\u2019s sticker placed there by someone you will never meet. He walked toward the fence with his towel over his shoulder like a sash. He did not raise his voice because you do not raise your voice at children or at men who come to collect them. \u201cWe don\u2019t take our children to caravans,\u201d he said, and felt his mother behind him, not in body but in broom. \u201cWe don\u2019t sign papers we cannot read while we are wet. We don\u2019t let anybody who says they will shepherd meet us at doors we did not open.\u201d The man tried to pivot to pleading and went through the motions with bored competence. \u201cWe\u2019re here to give options,\u201d he said, and opted to leave when he realized this line would not hold. When he went, he left the smell of the road and a small square of plaster that had lost its stick and fallen into the grass. A boy picked it up and held it like a beetle, fascinated by the edge between medicinal and sinister. \u201cLeave it,\u201d Auntie Mavis said, voice flat as a plate. \u201cThat thing doesn\u2019t have manners.\u201d\n\nHe received a call one evening from Paul, his voice smoothed by distance and a cup of tea. There was a festival, he said, in a city that liked to call itself world-class, a chance to do something with lights that would be kind, a panel where he could speak about breath and people would nod and then go to supper, an opportunity to be a person who had not been drowned by his own good fortune. They would fly him and give him a hotel which other people would have rushed to a long time ago. He listened and he was flattered because flattery is a spice, and he wrote the dates with the dignity of a man who had learned to put times in big letters. He checked the calendar he had taped to the fridge, the one that had people\u2019s names scribbled on Saturdays with arrows and question marks when a child\u2019s aunt had to work and the breath lesson needed to be moved to the afternoon. He looked at his mother who had chosen to plant beans where nothing had ever wanted to grow and had been rewarded with defiance in green. He told Paul he would think with his lungs and call back when his chest had decided. They said their goodbyes with the kind affection of men who had survived a corridor together. He sat in the doorway with the night ash-cold and thought about how you can turn a life into travel or into a neighborhood, and sometimes both, but never both on the same day.\n\nThat night the power went as if it had run out of patience, and the street performed its old resilience ritual of chairs on stoops and radios balanced like saints. The stars remembered to come and the moon behaved itself, not too full of opinions. A woman from three houses down sang quietly while she shelled peas, a kindness disguised as habit. Two teenagers argued about whether speed or honesty was better in a car. The neighbor\u2019s dog discovered a frog and apologized for it loudly. When his eyes had stopped complaining about the dark, Kabelo noticed a figure standing by the jacaranda that still hadn\u2019t risked flowers. Not hooded, no clipboard, just a person with their hands in their pockets like someone waiting for a bus that had stopped running. He felt his heart do the three beats and then the extra beat he knew too well. He rose before the old fear could wear his shoes, walked to the gate, and called out, the greeting loud enough to be heard by the right people and boring enough not to sound like a story. The figure looked up and the face arranged itself into something that remembered a shared history.\n\nIt was Mr. Lategan, without his coach voice and without the pool echoing him into larger than he was. He had a small parcel under his arm wrapped as if he had tried his best and then accepted that paper has opinions. \u201cYou left these in my locker,\u201d he said, sounding more defensive than the sentence required. Inside the paper were old notes, laminated by sweat and stubbornness, drills that had names like crocodiles and cars, and a photograph of a boy who looked like he had borrowed Kabelo\u2019s face, standing on the starting block with a smile as thin as the line between fear and boast. They stood with the gate between them like civilized men and Lategan watched the way Kabelo held the paper, the way a person watches medicine being measured. \u201cYou didn\u2019t drown,\u201d he said, and the compliment came out elegant because it had taken all day to find the right words. \u201cYour left shoulder behaved when it mattered,\u201d he added in the only love language he had. Then, after a silence that only old men know how to hold, he said, \u201cThere were men asking at the pool. Not the charity types. The types with shoes too new and questions too fast. I told them the only thing we export from this lane is sweat. If they come back, I will chase them with a kickboard.\u201d For the first time in years, Kabelo saw him not as accusation but as a man who had kept an eye out. He thanked him with a nod that let both of them keep their pride.\n\nThe call from London came the next day with a different flavor. Not Paul, not Eleanor, but a woman whose name filled the speaker with perfume and confidence. She was from a brand that could drape him in technical fabrics and teach him to prefer their water to the stuff that came out of taps. He listened and asked about clauses like a man who knew paper could try to adopt you, and he laughed once when she said they would like his story to bend in certain places. \u201cMy story is not a straw,\u201d he told her gently. \u201cIt does not bend to reach the bottom of your cup.\u201d After he hung up he marvelled at his own mouth and at the audacity of electricity when it let the call happen at all. He put the phone on the table and made tea with the reverence he gave to things that kept him tethered to a kitchen and not to a greenroom. He took the cup out to the stoep and found Auntie Mavis in his chair reading a magazine that had his face on the cover reproduced badly and his name spelled almost right. \u201cThey say you are a breath activist,\u201d she announced, proud, and he wanted to laugh because it sounded like something a superhero would stop doing in the sequel so he could raise his child. \u201cI am a boy who knows when to stop,\u201d he said instead, and she nodded as if he had finally said something that belonged in a house.\n\nThe Breath School grew not like weed but like beans\u2014slow at first, then all at once, the tendrils finding trellises where he had not thought to place them. A teacher from the primary school came and asked shyly if he might speak to a class about lungs and choices, and he did, bringing the plastic bottle he loved to crush and uncrush to show air its own tricks. A pastor came with his tie knotted as if it were a moral and asked whether he might mention the program in his sermon, and he said yes because he was not in the business of refusing free microphones as long as they didn\u2019t try to make his words wear shoes they didn\u2019t fit. A mother cried when her boy swam across the shallow end without choking on his own terror. A teen laughed at himself for the first time in a year and the sound made the water look up. An aunt threatened to bring a pot and a gas stove to the poolside because the boys ate like debt and she would not be caught short again. One Saturday a man arrived silently and watched from the shade with a cap pulled low. He didn\u2019t move to the caravans. He didn\u2019t move to the gate. When Kabelo went to him he found a face too familiar, not from television, not from dreams, but from a photograph put back in a Bible and turned into a bookmark.\n\nHis father stood up slowly, as if arguing with old decisions. He had the cautious posture of men who have learned to apologize with their hands. His shirt had been ironed by someone who wanted him to believe in second chances. He had a sleeve rolled twice as if he might be working soon. A small square of plaster lived at the crook of his elbow where a nurse might have found a vein, and it undid Kabelo a little because the body is an archive you cannot burn. \u201cYou swim now on the TV,\u201d his father said, finding the sentence he had practiced in taxis. \u201cYou stayed under like a story that does not end when I think it will.\u201d Kabelo felt a laugh and a sob find each other and agree to be civil. He didn\u2019t hug and he didn\u2019t scold; he pointed to the pool like a man offering a seat at a table and sadness did not go to his knife. His father nodded and sat, and for a long time they watched children teaching their panic a new job. After a while his father said, as if confessing to a teacher, \u201cI did not drown. I walked to the other side of the river and I pretended the other side was all there was.\u201d Then, as if asking not to be turned away, he added, \u201cDo you need a man to sweep, to fix things, to be told what to do?\u201d Some grace rose in Kabelo that was not his and belonged to the place and the morning and to his mother\u2019s broom waiting in the kitchen. \u201cWe are hiring anyone who can carry a stack of towels without stealing them,\u201d he said, and his father smiled like a man who had expected to be asked for tears and was offered a job instead.\n\nOn a Tuesday that smelled like wet bread, a woman came to the pool with a notebook and a camera-shaped like a sentence that would not be too long. She had hair that did not like rules and a face that did not use pity as a tool. He recognized something at her neck\u2014a square as tender as a memory\u2014and forced himself not to look at it as if it were a spell. \u201cLerato,\u201d she said, offering a hand that had been used to hold pens and shoulders. \u201cCommunity paper. I\u2019ve been trying to write about things that work. You would be surprised how few there are.\u201d She watched the children\u2019s faces and didn\u2019t ask them to look at her, which made him like her without negotiation. They spoke in the gaps between whistles and laughter, and she made notes the way a man makes tea: knowing when to stop pouring. When she asked about London he told her about river noise and sandwiches and how a building could develop a personality, and when she asked about the caravan men he told her that water makes truth happen faster. She looked at him the way Auntie Mavis looked at a chicken before she decided what sort of pot it deserved. \u201cPeople are going to try to use your words,\u201d she said, not as a warning but as a weather report. \u201cLet me write them down before they become a brand.\u201d He laughed because brands had tried to sit on his couch and he had moved the cushion.\n\nHer article came out with his name small and the times big and a photograph of the girl with the plaits looking at the water like it had apologized. The headline was not brave or clumsy; it had the look of a sentence that had decided to be useful: A Place To Practice Not Panicking. The paper was pushed under gates and put on counters and used as a doily under cups of tea, which meant the words would leave behind stains that made sense. A man from the municipality turned up with a clipboard and the nervousness of someone who had been told to check whether the rules were being bent. He stayed to the end and put his name on the volunteer list with a question mark by it, which made Kabelo want to hug government.\n\nNights moved into their steady composition, and the danger that had once stood in doorways learned to wait and then to wander off. The unknown numbers quieted like children when you give them a pencil and a task. London sent an email with a photograph of the tank lit like an altar, and he replied with a picture of the municipal pool under a sky trying to remember rain, and for a moment the two places agreed not to be jealous. When he couldn\u2019t sleep, which was less often now because exhaustion had decided to be generous, he walked to the pool and sat on the bench Mister Choi had donated in a burst of philanthropy that smelled like free advertising. The security guard, who had graduated from closing cans to closing gates, saluted him with a boredom that had become affection. He would slip into the water with the permission of a man who cleaned up after himself, and the pool held him without ceremony or cameras or speeches, just the quiet exchange of skin and element.\n\nOn one of those nights, some cloud decided to show off, stacking itself into bruises and opera. Lightning stitched two parts of the sky together with the efficiency of a seamstress who had been working for generations, and the air did that tight thing it does right before it speaks. He floated, the way he taught, at the softness between hearing and heartbeat. He thought about the words he had written on the tank in the theater that had decided to be kind to him that day, and he reached for the chalk stub he kept in his bag because water had taught him that nothing is permanent and therefore everything worth saying must be said again. On the concrete at the deep end, where boys dared one another to jump in and then laughed when they survived, he wrote slow and backwards, the way he had learned to do so that the world standing on the other side could read it. Ke kgetha moya, he printed, the Southerness of it pleasing him, the word for air able to carry spirit and weather and breath without complaining. He stood back and admired it like a man admires a pot that didn\u2019t burn even when it should have.\n\nThe next morning, kids pointed at the words and argued about whether it was Setswana or Sesotho and whether their teacher would give them extra marks for being able to say it out loud without fear. A mother ran her fingers over the letters as if checking whether language had a pulse. The lifeguard pretended he hadn\u2019t seen fresh paint on his concrete and then told a boy not to kick at the K while he hung on the edge. Lerato photographed it and didn\u2019t post the picture right away because sometimes you keep a thing to let it become itself before asking it to be seen. Bongani, when he saw it, read it out loud in the voice he used for drama, then swallowed and turned away to cough because there are sentences that don\u2019t require witnesses to work.\n\nHe called Paul back politely and told him he could come to the festival for one day and no panel and a quick train home because his bread was baking on Saturdays now, and Paul, who had learned to hear that not everything was a metaphor, arranged the tickets like a man setting a table for a person who eats fast and then helps wash dishes. He said no to the brand with the bottled water and yes to a local business that made towels that knew how to survive chlorine. He sent the man with the kickboard a WhatsApp video of a child who had taught fear to sit and the reply came back in three words: Left shoulder proud. He allowed himself to think about Eleanor and her hair and the way she had learned to hold her clipboard the way some women learn to hold very small dangerous animals, and he dictated her a long voice note he never sent that said nothing practical and everything honest: that he had found a way to give the light a job; that being boring had turned out to be the fun part; that if anyone ever tells her to shepherd him through a staff door again she should hit them with her lanyard.\n\nNot everything behaved, and not everything needed to. The caravan came back once, late, with the engine ticking in that expensive way. It parked by the corner where the robot refused to learn shame. Men leaned on it like punctuation marks, and the boy with the burn on his arm watched them the way cats watch birds, too smart to be caught by their own hunger. Kabelo called the detective with the boring shoes because sometimes you call boring on purpose, and a police van arrived with the old, weary indignation of a man who has already taken off his socks and been asked to put them back on. There were conversations with clipboards that blunted edges and paperwork that made nobody feel like a hero, and the caravan discovered other streets and the men learned that some neighborhoods keep brooms inside the doors. It did not feel like victory, more like a deadline extended, but sometimes you take those and you put them on the wall next to photographs of better days.\n\nOn a Thursday too hot for shirts he took his mother to the clinic for a blood pressure check because love chooses its glamour. They waited with women who had tied their children to themselves, with men who looked like they had learned to make small rooms of their own mouths rather than speak. On the noticeboard a paper hung crooked advertising a seminar about human trafficking with a font that had not slept enough. A small square of plaster hung by one corner from it, catching dust, and he felt a ridiculous urge to straighten it, to lend it dignity. He did not. He held his mother\u2019s bag and watched her let a nurse put the cuff on her arm with the same stoic courage she had used to teach him how to stand up in a pool. When the nurse said the numbers and declared them acceptable, his mother clucked her tongue as if she had done the mathematics herself and nodded once to the ceiling like a person thanking a god who had been on time for a change.\n\nWhen the first term of Breath School ended\u2014because Auntie Mavis insisted on terms and certificates or else nobody would respect a job done\u2014he printed ten cheap pieces of paper with elaborate language and gave them to children who held them like visas to cities some of them would never visit. The small boy with the dragon drawing had taped his original art to a cereal box panel and charged one rand to view it, two rand to borrow it for motivation, and he now demanded a certificate as well because capitalism expected its receipts. They took a group photograph that would end up crooked in living rooms and straight in their minds. The words at the deep end sat in the sun, patiently becoming part of the concrete through the slow chemistry of heat and time.\n\nOn Sunday, after the last of the certificates had been admired and spilled juice had been battled in a corner of the hall, the house was temporarily empty of noise. His mother had gone to sit with a neighbor who had been insulted by a cousin in a way that would require an afternoon to undo. Auntie Mavis slept with the television on purposefully, the way some people leave lights, as a deterrent to bad dreams. He walked to the pool alone with a towel around his neck and the key to the gate that Marco had given him like a blessing and a test. The sky had put away its dramatic inclination and replaced it with a modest blue. He slid into the water, which had learned him now, and floated on his back until the world ceased to need explanation.\n\nLater, when he dressed on the bench and laced his shoes, he heard laughter on the other side of the fence and looked up to find Lerato with her camera, her neck bare, the small square gone because skin heals and because motifs are not debts. She didn\u2019t raise the lens. She just stood and watched a man in a city choose air again because choosing is not something you do once. She lifted a hand in an unremarkable wave and he waved back the way neighbors do, as if this, and not lights or visas or alarms, had been the ambition all along. He walked home under trees that were still deciding and past a robot that had learned to be less shy and he thought, with the calm certainty of a person who has finally found a way to be a particular shape in the world, that there would be other doors and other men and other plasters, and there would be towels and oranges and Saturdays and rain. The pool would be open at nine. The children would come, and their panic would need work. The water would not lie. He would not either. He would teach them to stop one beat sooner than bravery asked, and to start one beat earlier than fear allowed, and that would be, for now, enough to keep breath honest.",
