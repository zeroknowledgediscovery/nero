     "novel_text": "He came up out of the ravine where the cattails whispered and the river forgot its name. A giant, they called him, because no other word made sense when he unfolded from the shadows like a crane from its operator\u2019s shack. He had a bucket in one hand, a brush in the other. There was no smell of turpentine, just a flat darkness that didn\u2019t glint, didn\u2019t take the moon the way ordinary paint would. He hummed as he walked. On the pavement, he left heel-and-toe prints that looked like punctuation marks. His hum was tuneless, an argument with music. Women waiting at the bus stop by the shuttered bakery pressed closer together, jackets tugged tight. He didn\u2019t rush. He never did. It was the slowness that nettled. He raised the brush, let it drip a black that wasn\u2019t quite liquid, wasn\u2019t quite shadow, and laughed without moving his open mouth. \u201cLook at you,\u201d he said, but not to any one of them, and when he flicked the brush, the air itself seemed to bruise. One of the women stepped forward, chin set, but a second woman caught her sleeve. The bus\u2019s headlights rounded the corner, and in the brightness the giant\u2019s dark looked blacker. He touched the bus shelter glass with two fingers and left a smear that the ad beneath couldn\u2019t quite hold. \u201cSmall lights,\" he murmured. \u201cYou\u2019re all small lights.\u201d He did not touch their skin. He painted their reflections.\n\nMr. Winn watched from a kitchen window three floors up, her mug cooling on the sill, her heart thudding the familiar old thud that now and then skipped and then remembered itself. People in the building still called her Mr. because they always had, because she\u2019d taught them math when they were younger and the habit clung like a chalk-smear. She was Winnifred in her passport, Win to the ones who dared, Mr. to everyone else, and she had stopped correcting them some time around her seventieth birthday when energy became a budget. She was eighty now. Her cane leaned against the microwave, a plaster saint in a family that didn\u2019t believe. From here she could see the river, the bus stop, the narrow lots. She could see the man, if he was a man. She saw the way he inclined his head to listen for the bus\u2019s brakes sighing, for the soft shuffle of sneakers. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to make them small,\u201d she told the glass, and her voice came out dry as a moth\u2019s wing. The news had called him a giant because it kept children in their beds and adults at their desks. Giants were fairy-tale. The truth of him was worse, being not quite fairy, not quite tale.\n\nThe night the first video went viral, her granddaughter had texted at 3:12 a.m., a string of messages that didn\u2019t quite form sentences. Mr. Winn had turned on the radio instead of the TV. She trusted the voices that kept company with storms. They said what they knew and left what they didn\u2019t in the hush between weather and the farm report. A name, Bob. It was the demotic of terror, a nickname for a thunderhead. Bob had come from nowhere and everywhere, a man large enough to bend streetlights into bows, a figure in a too-long coat, a sound like a truck idling. He taunted women, the announcer said, no singsong lilt to the words, just a flat line of information. He painted them black\u2014painted their coats, their hair, their shoes, the sidewalk beneath their feet, not with tar or oil but with a black that seemed to insist on itself. A mark. A shaming. Or something more ritual and more stupid. The line between prank and assault was a line he scuffed until it looked like there was no line at all. The radio voice went soft the way people do when they tell you your lab results aren\u2019t what they hoped. The police had a grainy still. Anonymous tips clogged the hotline. Copycats had already begun, across a city nine hours ahead, across a campus three in the other direction. The math of fear is always exponential. One becomes two becomes eight\u2019s echo.\n\n\u201cMr.,\u201d called Indira from the hall, knocking with the bent knuckle she used when she brought soup. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t stand in drafts.\u201d \u201cThen the drafts shouldn\u2019t stand where I\u2019m standing,\u201d Winn said, but she stepped back anyway, smile tucked in. Indira\u2019s face was lit with phone-light. \u201cHe\u2019s down there,\u201d Indira said, pointing like that would help, like Winn didn\u2019t have eyes of her own. \u201cHe won\u2019t come up,\u201d Winn said. \u201cMonsters like slopes.\u201d \u201cIs he a monster?\u201d Indira asked, and Winn let the question be a saucer she put down on the table without answering. They stood, two women in a kitchen that still smelled faintly of last week\u2019s onions. The refrigerator made the sound of a distant shore. \u201cYou can call someone,\u201d Indira said. \u201cWho would come?\u201d Winn felt the old teacher rise in her throat, the tone she used to call a class back to itself. \u201cThey\u2019ll come. They\u2019re always late, and they always come.\u201d \u201cDo you think he knows we\u2019re watching?\u201d Indira whispered. \u201cHe wants the watching,\u201d said Winn, and was surprised at the certainty in her own mouth.\n\nThe first time a copycat killed someone, it wasn\u2019t on purpose, an anchor said later in a voice tuned to hush hysteria. It never is, the anchor added in tone if not in words, and someone had to go to the hospital for saying what she wasn\u2019t allowed to. A young man in a hoodie had flung paint at a woman jogging at dusk along a seawall. She stumbled into traffic. A truck\u2019s driver didn\u2019t see. The numbers changed. They made the crawl at the bottom of every screen into a thicker rope. This is how it works, Mr. Winn thought, not for the first time. We name it. We feed it. It grows. In a grainy clip from Hamburg you could hear a man laughing: \u201cWe\u2019re painting the night,\u201d and a chorus of hoots, a laughter that sounded like coughs. In Lagos a woman sat on a stoop and wiped at her blackened hands with a dishcloth, her mouth a hard, white line, the camera recipient of her controlled fury. In Seoul a subway car stood with its doors open while maintenance crews swabbed at streaks that had seeped into the plexiglass like bruises remembering fists. The words were different because languages are, but the rhythm was the same. This was not just him anymore. This was a contagion that did not need a carrier now that the idea itself had a skeleton. Deaths rose in the way calculators do when your finger holds down a button too long.\n\nMr. Winn took out a notebook with a marbled cover and a list began without her permission. It was always like that. Lists were a reflex, a scratching itch. She wrote dates, times, locations, details that felt useful because they were small. \u201cHe hums,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNo gasoline smell. No brush marks when he moves away.\u201d She wrote: \u201cHe does not run. He is never earlier than the last bus. He looks up.\u201d She had a friend on the force, or had had, years ago, a young officer who\u2019d taken her class twice because math was a beast he wanted to domesticate. He was a detective now and wore his exhaustion like a well-cut suit. She still had his card, the printed number as irrelevant as a street address to a person who preferred bridges. She dialed him anyway. \u201cC\u00f4t\u00e9,\u201d he said, his voice the same as always, a tree trunk. \u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d she said, and waited for him to catch up. He did. \u201cMr. Winn,\u201d he said, warmth tucked under the formalities. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to give you,\u201d he began, and she cut him off. \u201cI\u2019m not asking for secrets,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m asking for your patience.\u201d \u201cThat I have,\u201d he said, and she could hear him set something down on a desk, the wafer of a coffee cup finding a ring. \u201cHe\u2019s out there,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s everywhere,\u201d C\u00f4t\u00e9 answered. \u201cTell your people to stay inside,\u201d she told him, and then laughed because who were her people anymore? \u201cWe\u2019ll increase patrols,\u201d he said instead of the truth, and in the pause they both thought the same thought: late, late, late.\n\nIf the giant had a name before the feeds named him Bob, if he had a mother who held his wrist as they crossed the street and told him not to touch the wet paint on the porch railing, if he had a neighbor who took in his mail when he went away once, none of it mattered now. Now he was a rumor that wore boots. He thought in alternating currents. He walked with a patience learned from watching a river wreck its banks. He did not dream. Or if he did, the dreams were what the world called waking. His hatred was not personal; he would have told you that if you had asked him and stayed long enough to endure the answer. \u201cIt\u2019s pattern,\u201d he would have said, \u201cit\u2019s the smallness of your lights,\u201d but what he meant was thrumming in his wrists, a music like a headache. Women turned the world. Women insisted on being suns. It offended him and that offense was his oxygen. He found a joy in making a gloss of the faces that would not shine for him, as though he could put night back where day had dared to nest. He had no slogans. He found them in the mouths of others, in the comments section that floated him like a sea supports a corpse. He didn\u2019t need to be smart. He needed to be seen. He was very, very good at being seen.\n\nFor a time, after her husband died, Mr. Winn had logged in to rooms filled with strangers who remembered things. She found homes in the places where the records of old roads lived, in the corners of the internet where aerial photographs of towns in 1953 meant something to someone besides a city planner. She had a handle, m.r.w., and a reputation for accuracy. It turned out that the people who hunted lost deeds and collected abandoned maps were the same people who saw patterns before the police framed them. They had threads. They had spreadsheets that looked like quilts. \u201cIt\u2019s a copycat cascade,\u201d someone wrote. \u201cNormalcy bias is broken, so they\u2019ll try anything that looks like story,\u201d wrote another, and Mr. Winn loved her for saying so. A person with a name that wasn\u2019t quite a name\u2014arkady\u2014sent her a file. She had to pick it up like the old days, with more caution than necessary. It was a clip of a garage where someone had recorded a shadow as it went by. Not much. Lucid noise. But in the audio, under the thrum of a refrigerator, you could hear a low voice say, \u201cPaint is confession.\u201d She played it again and again until the phrase lost meaning and turned to rhythm. Paint is confession. Confession to whom? The last time she had confessed anything it had been to her daughter on a bench by the river: I cannot be the woman you need me to be. She had meant patience. She had meant stamina. She had meant: I am old. Her daughter had nodded and held her hand as though Mr. Winn were the child and not the other way around. It had been a good day.\n\nWhen the night market came back to Kitchener after its winter break, the organizers posted signs promising extra security and foolishness at a minimum. The night smelled like sugar and charcoal. Mr. Winn went because she refused not to. She moved through the crowd like a ship through reeds, the cane making a percussive rhythm that kept her honest. Wachowski\u2019s dumpling cart had a line like a pilgrim trail. A girl at a stall called CandleLit sold jars the size of fists with wicks braided like sailors\u2019 knots. At the entrance, a police van idled, officers standing in pairs with the stiffness of people who want to be anywhere else. Mr. Winn found a bench made of three planks and a history of splinters. She let the crowd move around her. She had learned to be still. Around her, phones pointed at food and faces. The paint was obvious when it came because it did not catch the light. The giant did. He moved at the edge first, the way a storm tries out its voice before it takes to the center. A woman laughed too loudly at something in the next stall and the laughter cracked. He didn\u2019t go for her. He reached for the canvas of a mural someone had commissioned for the event, a wash of bright oranges and blues, a woman\u2019s face composed of flowers, a celebration, and with one calm swipe he salted it with night. The crowd hissed like a continent of kettles. He turned and the black he\u2019d made seemed to expand, a wet blot on the eye.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a right to that,\u201d Mr. Winn said, not sure whether she was talking to the art or the air around it. He heard her. Of course he heard her. He found her with an ease she found obscene, a snap of attention like a lighthouse beam falling square on a window that thought itself a secret. He smiled. He wasn\u2019t young, but he wasn\u2019t old. His face was the kind you forgot immediately while remembering forever the idea of it. He tipped his head at her, as if she\u2019d told a joke that he liked. \u201cYou like rules,\u201d he said. \u201cI like boundaries,\u201d she said. \u201cThey keep the wrong people out.\u201d He raised the brush. He didn\u2019t bring it close. He tapped it against his shoulder in a bored little rhythm. The black did not splatter. This was the thing that broke her heart more than anything: the black obeyed him. \u201cYou think names will help you,\u201d he said. \u201cThey always have,\u201d she said. He waited as if for a better answer and when none came, he turned away and trailed his brush along the ground in a line that the children would step over tomorrow as though it were the border between lands on a map.\n\nAfterwards, in the wash of siren colors and the sizzle of indignation, people gave her credit she hadn\u2019t earned. \u201cYou stood up to him,\u201d said a young woman with a shaved head and a tattoo of a sparrow on her wrist. \u201cI\u2019m very tired,\u201d said Mr. Winn, and meant it. C\u00f4t\u00e9 found her near the exit, his tie loosened, his face a cantilever of worry. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have engaged,\u201d he told her, the way a teacher tells a kid to keep hands flat on the desk. \u201cHe listens,\u201d she said. \u201cHe listens to hear where the fear is,\u201d C\u00f4t\u00e9 answered. \u201cThen we\u2019ll whisper,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t make jokes,\u201d he told her and then seemed to hear himself and smiled despite where they were. \u201cWe can\u2019t get ahead of him,\u201d he said, low. \u201cWe\u2019re always reading his footprints.\u201d \u201cBecause you keep pretending he\u2019s singular,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s not one. He\u2019s many, and he\u2019s a story.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t arrest a story,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can if it has a body,\u201d she said, and the look he gave her was something like belief and something like grief. He wrote his new number on the back of her hand like anyone\u2019s teenage friend and told her to call only if it mattered. \u201cIt always matters,\u201d she said, and he ran a hand over his hair and didn\u2019t answer.\n\nThe market closed a half hour early without calling it that. Everywhere, the faces of women had a new tightness to the mouth, a new swivel to the head on the neck. If you\u2019d been dropped into that crowd from space you would have said: there are hawks above. News came in even before she got home. A hospital in Newark on lockdown. In Jaipur someone with a bucket and a bandanna had been chased across a roof and had fallen wrong. A vigil in Prague, candles under a statue that wore a shawl of soot. The counts became their own tally marks. The lines on the graphs found a steeper angle as though something had leaned its weight against them. Someone on Stoneflower posted a screenshot of the growth curve with the caption, \u201cThis is not natural\u201d and Arkady answered, \u201cNothing viral needs to be natural once it\u2019s taken root in minds.\u201d Mr. Winn clicked and clicked until the numbers blurred and what remained was the thudding truth: this would get worse before worse became a measure too small to hold it.\n\nIn the morning, a thin envelope slid under her door. It had a stamp from a town she knew from the taste of its name. Bloom. A postmark like a scar. She sat. She was, if she was honest, a person who believed in omens if they came in the shape of the mail. The note inside had been typed on a machine that refused to give itself to the century. The letters had inconsistent ink, as though some of them had been loved more than others. Win, it read, which put a crack in her heart. Only three people wrote her that, and two of them were dead. The third was Lenka, who had left years ago for a prairie sky and never looked back. The note was four sentences. His paint isn\u2019t paint. It\u2019s the dark of a thing that eats light. Shadows can\u2019t swim. Find where the river is deeper than he thinks. Then, in a smaller script, as though shameful: It will like me less for telling you. She pressed the paper to her mouth as if she could taste the place it had been written. Shadows can\u2019t swim. Ridiculous. Useful. Most truths that mattered started as a thing you could only say slant.\n\nShe spent the day walking the city with the map of it superimposed on her brain like the overlay of a blue diagram. The river bent and split and gathered itself again. Bridges had personalities; some invited, some dared. At the iron footbridge by the old mill, graffiti had been layered so many times you could feel the strata with your fingertips, noble sediment of bored summers. She paused midspan and looked down into water that did not carry a perfect reflection but a rubbed-out version. Her cane leaned against the railing while her free hand held a thermos that had once belonged to her husband, a dent near the cap where the world had tried to whack it into another shape. \u201cHe wants a stage,\u201d she told the wind. \u201cHe wants a chorus and he wants it to sing his tune.\u201d She thought about the last bus stop before the bend, about the way the streetlights failed to reach the riverbank because budget was always what you thought you could hide beneath a word like prudence. It would have to be soon. The city could not keep holding its breath.\n\nThat night she didn\u2019t sleep so much as catalog horizontal hours. She had a dream about a classroom with no desks, the students standing, faces upturned like sunflowers, only their centers were black and the petals dull. She woke with a sentence in her mouth: To solve a problem, you have to believe a solution exists. It wasn\u2019t hers. It belonged to the textbooks she had flung away in disgust years ago. But a bad sentence can hold a good crumb, and she combed it. Believe a solution exists. Not a cure. Not a hero. A way. She found her boots. She found the key to the basement where the building\u2019s old laundry sink held water cool as forgiveness. She filled two bottles and swung them into a bag. She put on the coat that didn\u2019t mind rain. She wrote a note to Indira in case, because this is what you do when you leave the possibility of not returning. Hello I am taking a foolish walk. If I do not return, do not let them say I went quietly. She stuck it to the fridge magnet shaped like a pear.\n\nThe streets at midnight were a quieter kind of busy. A cat preluded her down the block and then ducked into a hedge as though embarrassed by its own company. A man in a parka walked a dog whose leash had LEDs that looked like a child\u2019s bracelet. The river spoke in its many voices. Ahead, the bus stop kept its vigil. There was no bus scheduled now, but buses have their own rules about crisis, and she\u2019d seen them roll up empty just to change the air. He would come. He had learned the schedule of their forgetting. Her cane struck sparks from the sidewalk in her mind, though it did no such thing in actual. She chose the far side of the shelter and stood where the bank sloped toward the water\u2019s shoulder. She was not, she scolded herself, a brave woman. She was simply the one who had gone. That will have to do, she told the imaginary teacher who lived in her sternum. Across the river, a light went on in a house and then off again, the occupant making a decision that was none of her business.\n\nShe heard him before she saw him. Not footsteps. A shift in the night\u2019s voltage. The kind of quiet that isn\u2019t empty but taut. The black came with him. It was as if he had a shadow that had recruited other shadows and all of them waited for his signal to advance. He was tall as a story told by a liar. He stopped beside the shelter and considered the ad for a thrill show in some city that wore its noise like a crown. He set down his bucket. The black did not slosh. \u201cYou again,\u201d he said without turning. \u201cMe,\u201d she said, and the sound was so inadequate she added, \u201cI taught math,\u201d as if competence could be an armor anyone would honor. He faced her then, and the brush lifted on its own as though a man had attached to it merely for show. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to write the world,\u201d he told her, and she didn\u2019t answer because it seemed foolish to disagree about something like that. \u201cYou get to scribble,\u201d he allowed. \u201cYou get to flick your little lights at each other and call it love.\u201d \u201cYou came from somewhere,\u201d she said, and surprised herself with the tear that rose and did not fall. He looked past her as if he had a more interesting student than this one. \u201cEverything comes from somewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what.\u201d He took a step toward her.\n\n\u201cShadows can\u2019t swim,\u201d she said, softly, like a prayer you don\u2019t admit to. He stopped. It was not the words; it was the posture of words. \u201cSomeone told you a joke,\u201d he said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a bad one.\u201d \u201cIt isn\u2019t a joke,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if it is, I\u2019ve chosen to laugh at you and not with you.\u201d \u201cDo you think you can insult a tide?\u201d he asked, and there was something close to admiration in it. \u201cI know tides fail,\u201d she said. \u201cThey fail to drown us every time.\u201d He took another step. The slope behind her waited, a darker dark. Her hands were steady. She thought of the letters in Lenka\u2019s note, some of them bold with habit. She thought of the little girl at the market with the sparrow tattoo who had said you stood up to him and had meant I wish I were you and had been wrong. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d she told him, lying. \u201cI do,\u201d he said, and for the first time there was something in his voice like honesty. \u201cI truly do.\u201d The brush lifted, something in the air tense as the skin of milk in a warmed pot.\n\nShe stepped back. The bank was steeper than it looked, the grasses slick with the day\u2019s leftover damp. The river took her ankle and then her knee. Cold wrote itself around her bones. She did not yell. He leaned forward, amused, but did not offer a hand. The dark around him thickened as if it took a breath. \u201cCareful,\u201d he said, mock concern a chord he could play well. She took another step back because she had committed to this, because retreat had become a kind of advance. The night rearranged itself in that moment into a diagram she could read. She felt the water pulling and the mud letting go. She smelled the city and the river and the paint that was not paint. The brush he held trembled, just slightly, as though it too had a pulse. He lifted it and extended it toward her, curious suddenly to see if the river would take the color the way walls did, if water could be made to admit his mark. He reached. She reached. His shadow tilled itself forward as a field does when a wind scythes it. And then\u2014Chapter 2\n\nAnd then the river did the oldest trick it knew, which was to be many things at once. It was a mirror smeared by thumbprints and a beast with a cold tongue and a ledger that remembered what fell into it. The tip of his brush hovered like a surgeon\u2019s scalpel and when the black that was not paint reached for the water, the water reached back in a way that was not reach at all but refusal. The smear he teased toward her slid off the bristles as if embarrassed to be seen and went to lie on the surface with the smugness of oil until the current tugged and the thing that ate light discovered that the feast was not for it. It puckered. It shivered like skin under a voltage. It tried, with the insistence of a stubborn child, to remain itself and could not. What had always obeyed him made a sound that was not a sound but a feeling in her teeth and the smear tore, not into droplets but into absences that collapsed under their own lack and fell through.\n\nHe flinched for the first time since she\u2019d seen him, a minute pull at the corner of his mouth as if a fish had tugged a hook buried there. His shadow did a strange mathematics, thinning away from the river\u2019s edge as if the slope were a proof it had failed. He shifted his weight, surprised, and the bucket cocked against his shin. She did what she had carried water through ninety minutes of doubt to do. She dragged the bag up from the wet against her hip, worked the cap with fingers that had taught endless children to turn stubborn screw-tops, and flung a bright rope of water across the low air between them. It arced, so small a gesture against so much night, and struck the bristles first. The brush convulsed like a living thing. The black on it did not splash; it retreated, trying to knit itself back into the ferrule and finding no seam that would hold. The little runnels that made a face of him a moment ago\u2014cheekbone shadow, socket, the hint of a jaw\u2014lost their conviction.\n\nHe snarled without voice, the throat working as though he\u2019d swallowed a burr. He reached for her with the empty hand, not for help but for the satisfaction of forward motion, and his boot bit into the grass and then into the mud that had planned this. She had planned this too; she took another back-step because sometimes the trap is the willingness to stumble. The river made a sound at her knee that, if you had no poetry, you would call glug and if you had too much, you would call invitation. She uncapped the second bottle, her hands remembering the thermos from her husband\u2019s factory nights, the tin taste and the winter steam, and she poured again. This time she went for the line where his darkness lay on the ground like fabric. The water, which was only water and did not know itself as weapon or mercy, ran into the black and the black thinned again like a rumor encountering fact.\n\nHe tried to draw the brush back and found that he could not do it clean. Fibers clung, or not fibers, whatever the shadow\u2019s equivalent of hair might be, tugging like weed-roots. For a heartbeat he was a boy in a backyard with a too-strong kite tugging at him, the wind not physics but will. He stepped after it out of habit and the bank, with the impartiality of a ledger, subtracted him a degree of balance. The bucket went over. It did not pour; it leaned and the dark inside of it tried to decide whether to answer gravity like a liquid or like a position held by a soldier. In the indecision the river found opportunity. It pulled, which is to say it recited its catechism of down, and the lip of the bucket kissed the surface and the thing in the bucket made a noise like a string snapped back on a cello and then lost shape.\n\nTo call what happened next panic would be to reduce the moment to a nervous system. He did not flail. He did something worse, which was to calculate and lose. His hand tightened on the brush, the way a person grips a talisman that has never once warranted such faith. The black that had always loved him, if love is obedience, wavered as his shadow did, its edges feathering where the river breathed. He had never looked young to her and he did not now, but the set of his shoulders admitted confusion in the language of muscle. He stepped away from the water and discovered that away had contracted. The strip of grass that had been his dry stage was a scarf, a belt, something narrow that had lost pretension to breadth. His laugh, when it came, had no shape to it. It was the laugh of a man in an elevator that has stopped between floors, hands empty, the plan a mist.\n\nShe was cold to the hip now and her joints were giving her their old lecture, but she\u2019d made promises to herself in the hours the dream with the sunflower faces had eaten. She stayed. She did again the small thing that the large thing disliked. She sloshed what remained along the toe-space of him, a line not at his body but at the insistence outside his body that dressed him. The sound it made didn\u2019t repeat; it never repeated. This time it was almost relief, like a sighed yes in a sleeping room. Shadows can\u2019t swim, Lenka had typed, and here was the footnote: they could drown or they could be rinsed away or they could snap back hard and cut. When a piece of his dark tore free and fell into the river, it made a hole where the night should have been and then the hole filled with an ordinary mid-March black. She watched the absence remembering itself into one more stripe of water.\n\nHe did not run. He shed. He let go of the brush all at once and when it hit the bank it did the worst possible thing, which was nothing. It lay like a stick. It had become a stick. Something in him swarmed, the way hornets braid when their home is kicked. He reached for the bucket and thought better of it, for the first time honoring the river. He took a step back and the knife of mud on his boot tried to cut a second step from the bank and could not. The slim humiliation of it was visible even in the dark. He looked at her as if she had relieved him of a coat and then refused to give it back, as if she had revealed an indecency. \u201cSmall lights,\u201d he said, but the words had no doctrine in them; they were rote. He tugged at the hem of his too-long coat as if to arrange a dignity that would travel and then walked the slow backward line he walked when he was on a stage he had not chosen.\n\nMr. Winn stood still until the cold worked its way through the brave and down to the practical. Her left foot was a complaint she could not ignore and the river, which respected no plan but its own, lifted a little to see if her hip might want to be a rock. She came up out of the water fox-slow, all calculation about which leg deserved to be first, the cane in a loop of strap around her wrist saving itself for the moment it would be more friend than emblem. She watched him cross the sidewalk, his shadow shortened, pinned to his heels like a one-sentence apology. He left no heel-and-toe punctuation now, just the plain grammar of boots. The bucket stayed upended, the brush a stick, the black in the grass a kind of bruise that did not spread, the night adjusting to an absence it had not known it had arranged around a man.\n\nThe bus that pulled up then was one of the hybrids, a hummed contralto riding under its breath. The driver saw her and in the space between habit and policy threw the lever that made his bus lower its knee. He came down two steps and then paused, taking in the river, the toppled things, the woman sopping at the edge of what could only look like a bad idea come to teach a class in consequences. \u201cYou all right, ma\u2019am?\u201d he asked, which was what he had to ask to unlock any other sentence. \u201cI will be,\u201d she said, which was the only answer she could trust. There were two passengers. One of them cried quietly without any connection to this scene, the kind of tired we never legislate; one of them held a bag of groceries like a baby. The driver looked past her into the dark the way you look at a dog that might or might not come when you call its name. \u201cYou want a blanket?\u201d he asked, and when she nodded he went into the belly of the bus and came back with a roll of orange wool that smelled\u2014to her surprise\u2014like clean sun.\n\nBy the time she got herself up the stairs in her building, leaving wet on each step the way a snail leaves a slick, she had made a new list in the recess where lists live. The headings were simple, the subpoints anything but. Water interrupts. Running water eats edges. The brush is not tool; it is permission. The bucket and the brush, when unaccompanied by him, revert to the world. He is bound to the thing or the thing is bound to him in the old way of stories and belts. She peeled off her wet pants in the kitchen, because it was nearer the radiator and because the kitchen had always been the bravest room in any place she\u2019d lived, and wrapped herself in the orange bus blanket for twenty civilized minutes. Then she got up, because reward is not a plan, and put the stick-that-was-a-brush and the upended bucket into the galvanized basin in the basement. She did not touch them with naked hands. It was the sort of precaution best left unspoken if you wanted anyone to take your scientific habits seriously.\n\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 arrived with the morning in his face, thread-tracks where sleep had been and left. He knocked three times and then two, the way people do when they\u2019ve practiced their courtesy. When she opened the door, he did the count in his head you only see when someone who is stubborn has done a sensible thing, and he nodded as if to say: I choose not to lecture you because it would cost too much coin from a purse you don\u2019t carry. \u201cYou look like someone who fell in a story,\u201d he said, and she made the shape of a laugh. He went to the sink without asking because the years let you and took the kettle from the stove and refilled it and set it back as if tea were as tactical as everything else he had learned to do. She told him and he wrote nothing down because the words made enough of a pattern without ink. When she got to the part where the brush became a stick, he put a hand to his mouth, not to hide surprise but to keep it from running off.\n\nThey went down to the basement together as if it were a ritual, the kind where you go toward the thing to make it less holy. The basin sat like a font someone had scooped out of the wrong religion. The bucket leaned and didn\u2019t drip. The stick lay across it with the boredom of a ruler on a desk. He reached and stopped and then reached again, because caution can topple into superstition and he had always been braver than that. His fingers went to the bucket\u2019s lip the way a locksmith goes to a key, all respect. He accelerated the world with a small tilt. They both held breath. Nothing happened except the small chuff of air that lives under emptiness. \u201cIt\u2019s not paint,\u201d he said, making factual what had been atmospheric. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cLenka writes as though we\u2019re living in a folk catalogue. Running water, bridges, invitations refused. Shadows can\u2019t swim.\u201d \u201cLenka?\u201d he asked, and she let him know what there was to tell without bending the light toward romance.\n\nIt should have been a relief and was only a shape that looked like one from a distance. He would increase patrols near the river and the markets; he would put a note on the overnight brief to ask that cruisers carry a case of bottled water meant for parched protestors and now repurposed for witchcraft. He would be laughed at by a man with teeth like polished cutlery, the laugh a thing with three syllables of contempt in it, and then later he would catch that same man undoing the top of a bottle and he would look at the ceiling and tell no one. \u201cYou\u2019ll be careful,\u201d he said, and they both let it sit on the table like a lily. \u201cI will be old,\u201d she said, which was not the same.\n\nStoneflower, which had only ever been a place for maps to find their friends, shifted its fire like any camp does when the wind misbehaves. When she typed her notes, her private was not very private because everyone who needed to know could smell when something had moved under the tent. Arkady came up from under her into the thread like a diver, leaving green trails of code and a word that no longer meant anything to younger mouths: careful. Someone in Reykjav\u00edk posted a clip, thirty seconds of a street where rain had come down and a bucket had not worked the way its carrier had hoped, which is to say the street had become crowded with the wrong kind of river and the man in the too-long coat had decided that a doorway was a better idea. Someone in Durban wrote in a clarity that cut the way good knives do: moving water is a boundary in many stories; we stop calling them stories when they are ours. They began, one of them, two of them, then eight with echo, to put blue icons next to their names, not ribbons because ribbons go hard with pride but drops, the shape so simple it tricks you into thinking it has no teeth.\n\nIn the building, Indira came with soup and expectation. \u201cI saw the blanket,\u201d she said, and Mr. Winn would later bless the universe for people who could make a syllable do that much work. They sat at the old table that had come with a man who could make what wood wants from only a knife and patience and they spoke the kind of sentences that live only between women with no desire to be applauded. They spoke about kettles and the refund the market would not give because it had spent it already and about how to put bottles near places where you might need them without becoming an advertisement for a war. Indira\u2019s niece printed flyers that said Riverwater, a tidy list of places you can fill and an even tidier list of where not to, and a note in a font that made you want to listen: we will not hunt, we will only interrupt. Someone from the second floor added in pen because pens are how revolutions remember themselves: bring cups.\n\nShe slept then, not deeply, but usefully. In the anteroom of sleep she saw the brush twitch back to being a brush like a frog unhexing to frog and she woke hurting and smiled hurt, which had been a private sport of hers since the year her husband\u2019s heart made its last, foolish noise. In the morning the graphs tried to north again and then plateaued, and the anchors\u2019 voices held a border of baffled hope the way cake holds icing on a too-hot day. Copycats who were never more than paint and bile found they were easy to pick up by the scruff when girls with water pistols pinned them at fountain\u2019s edge and sprayed and their shouts broke into adolescents\u2019 squeals against their will. The big one, the one whose not-paint starved under river rules, moved away from the damp and into the parking structures where the air is always wrong. He no longer drew lines on the ground and asked children to hop them. He put his fingers on mirrors and left the kind of smear that makes you check your face for something you cannot see.\n\nShe went with C\u00f4t\u00e9, one afternoon that pretended to be spring but was a liar, into a garage that had become a chapbook of attempts. The mirror of an elevator wore black around its frame like eyeshadow on a person who had slept in it. A line of compact cars had black hats. A last-year snowpile that had become sediment watched them from a corner with indifference. She had brought a thermos because she had learned to bring a thermos to everything, and when she unscrewed the cap the pour did something strange. It went slow where it should have gone quick. It veered like a drip finds a path along a ceiling. It made a new lace out of the black that had thought itself a stain and turned it into nothing more heroic than wet floor. The young officer at C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2019s elbow exhaled in a little hymn and then tried to put the air back in his mouth, embarrassed at having made that much emotion in front of veterans.\n\nThey made the city practice something it had never wished to be good at. Sprinklers were asked to stay up into the night. The water department, which had always thought of itself as the sibling who worked and never got invited to weddings, became the guest everyone wanted to sit beside. Hydrants were tested and their caps painted with humorous murals of fish wearing crowns because if you do not make a little joy of your tools you will grow to hate them. The night market issued its new rules in a voice grown soft with apology and stubbornness both. There would be water tents beside the tarot readers. There would be jugs beside the buses. There would be a child at a folding table with a sign that said free refills in writing that leaned to the left as if running downhill.\n\nNothing cured. He adapted. He learned the timings of sprinklers and chose hours when the water\u2019s art had ended. He ordered an umbrella from a catalogue of amusing goths and when it arrived it blazed black that was simply black, not anything more interesting. He used it primly, which was the only way he could use anything. He went indoors more. He began to sit in the last pews of churches with the confidence of a man who has confused pew for throne, and when women walked past him he hummed his anti-music and let his dark make small taps that would have been kisses if he had been a person who believed in kisses. Mr. Winn stood in a vestibule one Sunday behind a rope of old ladies whose faith was a habit and watched his dark hesitate at a dish of holy water and then move around it with a courtesy that made her laugh in a way that made the usher give her a glance he had been saving since 1973.\n\nAt night she and Indira and four others who did not need a name met in the laundromat because the hum was protective and the light was honest. They rolled coins between their fingers and talked about schedules and about whether the children should be the ones to carry the bottles because they were fast or never the ones because they were those you are obliged to shield. They talked about whether to leak the phrase shadows can\u2019t swim into the sweetpipe of the rumor machine or hold it under their tongues like a peppermint that lost its taste only slowly. Arkady wrote: secrets held too tight turn into teeth; give it away and it will be a song. Lenka wrote again and the postmark was a farm town with a name like a jar of jam and she had typed with even more inconsistency this time, the ink giving up on a couple of vowels. A river is not the only running thing, the note said. There is blood. There are crowds. There are the conveyer belts at the airport that we pretend are polite. She added in the small shame-hand: I am not joking and I am not pleased to be right.\n\nOf the things Mr. Winn had taught, one returned like a native bird. You put numbers to your feelings so they don\u2019t run away with you. A week into water, the calls edged down. The copycats lost interest when they found that women with Nerf guns and adult patience could humiliate them in the uncomplicated way that breaks a boy\u2019s willingness to be brave for the wrong prize. The tally of deaths, which had become a rope dragged behind a boat with too many bodies on it, slackened. Someone put teal ribbons on an iron fence again and their flutter did not feel like an apology no one accepted. And yet the man who was not theorem and not myth had learned the lot numbers of fear. He moved to places where water would be needle and not sheet. He learned grocery aisles, the way the misters go on and off in produce. He learned gyms, the hour their showers fail the health inspection and close. He learned how to be drought.\n\nOne evening, Arkady wrote: come to the pool. Mr. Winn took the sentence into her kitchen and asked it to sit. The pool was a city thing, a rectangle with an echo, the place where summer\u2019s children practice the small civilities of lane etiquette and winter\u2019s elders remember that their bones used to be more than columns. She went, which is to say she let herself be driven by Indira, who had a hand on the wheel that kept time with a song no one else could hear. The lifeguard, a child with shoulders like intentions, closed the doors and pulled the blinds because if you are going to change anything you must make a theatre of it. C\u00f4t\u00e9 was there, which made a wrongness right, and two women who had been painted and who wore that fact like a pin that says I voted. Arkady sat at a table with a laptop and spoke as if she were presenting a plan for a picnic: he likes mirrors; he hates surfaces he cannot count on; he would like to make this water pretend not to be itself.\n\nThey made an experiment from the awkward grace of community. They put a small pane of plexi on a pole and drew a line of his black across it. They lowered it into the water while all the bodies in the room learned to flinch at the same time. The line smudged airlessly and then unmade itself, not dissolving, no chemistry anyone in a white coat would approve, only losing the arrogance that allowed it to be a substance. It took longer than at the river because stillness defers decisions. The painted women in the corner breathed like people who have relearned a word in a language they forgot they spoke. They did it again and this time lowered the brush, which she had not wanted to touch until this moment because touching is a confession when you have been telling yourself you are a mind. The brush trembled against the surface of the water as if remembering the night it had been unmade and refused and she loved it for being wood again.\n\nThe test did not give a cure; it gave a list. Running faster works better than waiting politely. Moving water is a hungrier mouth. Distance isn\u2019t virtue; it is just distance. He, wherever he was that night, might have felt a tug in the hamstrings if that is the kind of story you allow yourself, the kind where the villain\u2019s muscles know when his tools are misbehaving. Mr. Winn sat on the staging and put her feet into the shallow end and ate a piece of chocolate that had been in her pocket since October and tasted of lint and found it exquisite. C\u00f4t\u00e9 stood near the door and talked into his phone with the patience of a man explaining arithmetic to a budget. Arkady packed the laptop with the tenderness people reserve for instruments that have failed them and might yet surprise them. Indira leaned her head on Mr. Winn\u2019s shoulder in a way that said: even warriors have necks.\n\n\u201cPaint is confession,\u201d she told the quiet on their way home, because it had been waiting, wanting to be said not to a recording but to a road. If he were only paint, the confession would have been: I am lazy, I am mean, I am jubilant at my own power. If he was the dark of a thing that eats light, the confession might be: I am hungry and I mistook my hunger for a map. She did not forgive him. She did not make a speech about forgiveness in her head. She named the things she knew how to name. Buildings, streets, the crook in the river, the woman who sang on the porch three doors down in a voice that had never been paid. Her heart did its old skipping trick and then remembered itself and she blessed it for its learning.\n\nHe was not gone. He sat in a booth in a diner that still had the original tiles and watched a waitress brush crumbs into her palm and told himself a story about crumbs and women that would have made a smaller man blush. He watched the window, the way the snow-scar on the curb had turned to a gutter of water and none of it had come into the diner because some buildings have opinions and some doors honor them. He thought about the river and how it had spoken back to him and he felt, for the first time, the pressure of choosing. He could leave. He could go to a city that had paved its river into an act of memory. He could become rumor only and surrender the weight of boots. The comment sections would still float him. He could be borne.\n\nBut there was a bus stop by a hospital he hated for the way it let women emerge stronger than when they went in, as if brokenness were only an opinion. He thought of that glass, how he had once stroked it and made the ad below it choke on a kiss it had not invited. He stood and the diner\u2019s bell on the door made a noise that had been someone\u2019s idea of cheerful. He left his coffee half-drunk because leaving a thing uncompleted was his private sacrament. He walked in that measured way that made the air think twice and the women at the counter leaned toward each other the way birds do when hawks are above. Outside the snowmelt had its own plans. He did not alter his route for water; he did not yet believe in priests.\n\nMr. Winn watched the hospital stop from a distance that kept faith with both prudence and desire. She had a thermos because she would always have a thermos now like people have their keys. She had a girl from the eighth who had spent the summer interning at City and knew how to talk to a parking authority so they beam smoothed instead of roughing up. The glass of the shelter was new and therefore felt brave, and she admired it the way you admire a child winning the first time at anything. When he came, he came like weather called by a conductor. He did not look up at the cameras because he no longer cared about those eyes. He put his two fingers on the glass as if he were greeting it like an old friend. The black tried to come forward with him like a well-trained pet and then stopped with its nose up against the new film some municipal genius had spread with a roller at three that morning, a film that promised hydrophilicity in the kind of brochure that would not normally travel far from trade shows.\n\nHe pressed. He pulled back. The smear he made attempted to be a smear and met its litigant in the thin wet that the film called up from air almost by thought. It would not hold. The ad below, cheap and earnest, did not choke. It simply looked back through the wet at him with the stupid dignity of printed eyes. He let his hand fall. He hummed his un-melody. He turned his head because something had changed and you always turn your head toward change the way you turn toward a dropped tray in a restaurant. Two women step toward him not to attack and not to scold but to stand. They had badges, not police, not anything that will ever carry a gun, badges that said volunteer and a drop shape, and their bodies made a shadow on his shadow the way clouds make promises to fields. He chose not to move at all. He chose to own immobility as if it were skill.\n\nHe stared at the hospital doors and she stared at the bend in the river where it cleared its throat before it mazed through town. She did not look at him. She did not make herself a mirror. She lifted the thermos and poured water in a small curve along the lip of the shelter\u2019s slab and the water went on doing, in this dry season of men\u2019s making, what it had decided to do before men. The volunteer on the right told a joke about hydrants so quiet the other volunteer had to lean to hear it and they both smiled in a way that made the air less sure of itself. Mr. Winn took a new page in her marbled notebook when she got home and wrote on it with a linearity that would have made her younger self smirk. Stories require boundaries. Shadow requires surface. Water upsets both. He requires applause. We can practice silence. She wrote practice twice because everyone always forgets that the word is both noun and verb, both plan and doing.\n\nThat night the building\u2019s roof collected the faintest of rains and the buckets placed there by superstitious women and one good-natured super made small sounds of satisfaction. The internet, which had never loved her, loved what she and Arkady did not claim to have invented and therefore could not be caught taking credit for. There were videos of children\u2014yes, she had lost this argument\u2014holding up mister bottles like talismans and spraying as if christening streets. There were aunties tying ribbons with the drop shape around spigots and hoses. There was a woman in Lagos who said in her calm camera voice: we do not purify him; we do not purify ourselves; we make him slip. There was a priest in a collar not yet yellowed who said: we always had this; we baptized and forgot how.\n\nThe next morning, the envelope on her door had no postmark at all. The letters had been glued in the way of a school project, cut from newspapers and from the edges of magazines that would be missed only by people who care about font. It said, in the flat poetry of threats: rivers dry. She held the card over the sink as if the sink would catch any extra ugliness and she laughed, because people who think themselves storms always forget that storms travel, that there are lakes, that there are pipes, that there are mouths and if they are all you have left you make a river of them too. She got her coat. She tucked the note into the old cookbook she never used because good measures are not always recipes. She went to the elevator and the black on the mirror there had been washed again into ordinary by some underpaid person\u2019s deliberate kindness, and she blessed that person with the decency of anonymity. On the way down she practiced the sentence in her head that she would say to C\u00f4t\u00e9. It was not: we are winning. It was: we are learning.\n\nAcross town, in a garage that took its smells from tires and metal and tired men, he stood with his palm pressed flat to a pillar and felt the vibration of a freight elevator he hadn\u2019t known was there. He liked the feeling because it made him think he was in the world and not merely on it, but then he had always mistaken vibrations for invitation. He tried again the old trick of the brush and found it made nothing but black that wanted to be a stare and could only be blink. He straightened and the men at the workbench found themselves too careful with their wrenches. He picked up a rag someone had left and he carried it with him down the ramp and out into the late day, and if you had looked from far you would have said: a janitor on his way to the next mess. If you had looked closer you would have seen a man practicing an intimacy and failing. If you had looked closer still, you would have seen the place where the rag was dark remember ordinary dirt and dismiss anything grander.\n\nHe went to the river anyway because hunger will visit the house that has locked its doors and will sing under the window until someone cries uncle. He stood on the bank above the deep he had underestimated and wished with an intensity he had only ever lavished on women\u2019s fear. He wished he could believe in something older than his wanting. The river said none of this out loud. It did not gloat like men who win. It went on with its list: stone, leaf, paper, light. It took the city\u2019s talk about it and sluiced that too. It did not refuse him because it is not a person. It refused to be his. That was enough. He turned, and the print he left on the path was ordinary and then there was the smallest sound, a bead of water falling from a branch onto a dried leaf, and he flinched like a horse.\n\nShe sat at her window and let herself be an oak when she was only a woman. She put her hand flat on the glass the way you do when a cat insists on being on the wrong side of a door. Her granddaughter texted her a string of nonsense that resolved into the picture of the child\u2019s hand held under a faucet, water pearling at the base of the thumb, a caption from a life Mr. Winn had not lived at that age: like armor. She wrote back a heart, the old boring emblem that is sometimes a good, quiet truth. She turned off the radio because the farm report had become a dirge in its insistence on the price of corn when she wanted the price of us. She said out loud, to the much-underrated saints of plumbing: keep time with me. Then she did the math on the back of an envelope again like a woman after war, dividing what we have by how many we are and discovering with astonishment what will do when we let it.Chapter 4\n\nThey put the city on a diet of water at the same time they taught it to throw water like a punch and the contradiction sat on every kitchen counter in the form of a note from Public Works. Use less, it said, with the tone of a parent who has been kind for too long. Use smart, the same note added, as if smart could be folded into a faucet. Mr. Winn stood over her sink and did the arithmetic no one who writes those notices ever shows their work on. There were gallons whose destiny was a lawn. There were gallons that were already promised to teeth and tea and a thousand small cleanlinesses. There were gallons that, poured at a bus shelter at the right second, could interrupt a man who had mistaken attention for oxygen. She made a list of taps the city could loosen without killing its own: hydrants for six sharp minutes on the quarter hours when shifts changed, cooling misters that would be fed by the graywater that no one believed in until the word gray turned out to be a kind of moral help. She wrote to a councilor who liked to be the first to know and the reply came back with the pace of a person who peeks over the cubicle wall: come say that into a microphone so that I can be the one who thanks you for it.\n\nStoneflower thrummed not with panic but with project. Arkady posted a video of a fan fitted with a hoop of foil streamers that churned the light in a room until the shadow in it could not stand still long enough to call itself anything but weather. It was nothing like science and everything like it, in the way of kitchen experiments that become recipes because a thousand hands stir them exactly the same wrong way. Someone in Winnipeg replaced the tinsel with strips cut from Mylar blankets they handed out at races and found that moving reflection worked as well as moving water when it came to making darkness lose track of its own outline. The thread became a bazaar of improvised flows: bead curtains that shivered when doors opened, sheets pegged to clotheslines over sidewalks and flapped by box fans stolen from bedrooms, panels on rolling casters that pushed wind ahead of them the way children push enthusiasm. Arkady wrote in a lower font, because of course she did: it is not that we are trying to blind him; we are trying to keep him from finding a surface to be sure of.\n\nHe, who had built his church out of the small faiths of strangers\u2019 faces, adapted with the stubborn purity of a man determined to be original in an era that had no use for originals. He moved away from places that glistened and into places with carpet. He discovered that the black of him could sit, complacent, on upholsteries where water was a threat to deposit rather than a promise to cleanse, and for a spell he haunted waiting rooms the way a bad smell does. He hummed his hurt-music and trailed fingers near the photographs of mountains that administrative assistants put on walls to say: look, we are not a machine, we have views. The volunteers learned to carry sprayers with diluted detergent and to ask receptionists for rags with a conspirator\u2019s smile that made those women feel suddenly and correctly like the keepers of the city. He went to the hospital lobby once more, and the film\u2014some clever soul\u2019s hydrophilic darling\u2014made him scowl because it was invisible and effective, the two things he hates.\n\nThe doctor at her heart clinic listened to Winnifred\u2019s chest and frowned thoughtfully in that way medical school teaches you when the truth is: I would put you in a box if I could and take you home like a rare bread, just to keep listening. His stethoscope was cold. His hands were not. He said the word arrhythmia as if he were afraid he might bruise it. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s been a companion,\u201d and then surprised them both by naming it Teddy, which made him chuckle and made the nurse look down so that her face might not betray her pleasure. \u201cDo not forget that even the best companions know when to go quiet,\u201d the doctor said, which was his way of saying: rest when you can and don\u2019t play at hero. Her granddaughter showed up that afternoon with a plastic tub of chopped fruit and a plan that consisted mostly of standing in the doorway and being eighteen in a way that air likes. They looked at photographs in an album that smelled of basements and of the kind of paper no one makes anymore. The girl traced faces with one finger as if those people were all in there still, moving.\n\nIt was Lenka\u2019s second letter that pushed them to a place no city is ever truly prepared to be comfortable with. Conveyors, she had typed badly, and added a sketch of an airport walkway that had been cut from a magazine years ago and taped to a page in a way that said she\u2019d been saving it for the day it became what it was not. Mr. Winn took it to Indira, who had a cousin on a union executive that still believed solidarity could be tasted. C\u00f4t\u00e9 reached for the lever that made official channels move; he did not pull it gracefully because nothing with that many pulleys can be stroked, but he pulled. The airport director met them with the face of a woman who had negotiated with weather and with pilots who thought they were weather and did not enjoy admitting that a small old woman with a cane had brought her something she could use. \u201cTell me the version that makes me look savvy in a memo,\u201d the director said, which is to say she was ready.\n\nYou never see an airport quiet unless you are either very early or very wrong. The night they took it for themselves, the place hummed like an aquarium. Belts that spent their days shouldering luggage wore only light now and the squeak of bearings that would be greased in the morning by a man named for his grandfather. A custodian whose name was stitched in blue stood with his mop like a spear and blessed them with an expression he probably used when his team scored, if he ever went to games. Mr. Winn placed her hand on the moving walkway\u2019s rubber edge and felt the minute inconsistent bumps that have no poetry until you need them and then they become the stanza you can recite by heart. Arkady activated the curtains, a shiver of water that was not theatrical enough to make toddlers clap and not brutal enough to make teenagers post, just enough to count as running in the right way. They put out cones in a pattern that would make a herd flow without making it feel herded, because Lenka\u2019s note had told them: crowds have current when they choose to.\n\nHe came with his own weather. Of course he did. He had read the rumor the way a man reads his reflection in a window and declares himself handsome because the night allows it. He did not like airports because airports do not care what you like; they are rituals that swallow individuality and spit it back in the exact bag it arrived in. He walked with the disdain that says men in vests should move aside and they did, because vests do not pay them enough to argue with disdain. The brush had been replaced because sticks do not resurrect and there is always another brush in the town that sells Home Improvement to men who are looking for a version of fatherhood. He aimed it at the chrome panelling along the moving walkway, which had been polished by boredom into a mirror so complacent it did not expect to be asked to do any work. When the black met movement, when the bristles found that their certainty ran away from them a fraction of an inch each second without ever consenting to be a single surface, it did not hold. It scummed and slipped and made the sound of teeth lightly worrying glass without leaving a bite.\n\nThe belts ran not fast, because this city was not a city that ever truly rushed, but with a confidence that belonged to machines and to rivers both. Volunteers stepped onto the belt in twos the way a dance begins at a wedding when the DJ knows something about age. They moved along him without stopping and their bodies made a current that bent his shadow oddly, pulling it toward their ankles the way grass leans toward a storm. One woman\u2019s purse brushed his coat and the small apology she gave out of habit was like a blessing he did not know how to receive. He reached for the chrome again and a curtain whispered between his hand and the panel, a mist that did what water does when it is asked politely to decide against the continuation of a mistake. His hum lost confidence. He tried concrete\u2014always a good friend to him in the old days\u2014and found that the film the contractor had laid overnight at the direction of a woman he had never learned the name of made concrete act less like a wall and more like the skin of a fish half out of water.\n\nMr. Winn stood where the belt spit people back into their own legs and she used the lip of her thermos cap the way you would use a thimble to stop blood: precise, unpanicked, repetitive. There was a part of her that grew impatient with the theater of it, not because the work was melodramatic\u2014it was not\u2014but because she had always hated spectacle and here was one of theirs even if it was quieter than he would have asked. C\u00f4t\u00e9 kept up a cheerful murmur into his radio that sounded to anyone who did not know him like a man trying to make a burger order more interesting, and to anyone who did like a string you use when you want to keep a kite from bolting. The belt lifted his dark in slices that did not want to be slices and carried them toward the end where a catchment waited, a trough that the maintenance crew had insisted on calling a fish ladder until the looks from the women in the room made them try again and land on the less romantic\u2014and therefore more useful\u2014term trap. The pieces fell in and made a sulk on the surface. The tiny pump there, the only part of this entire evening that had been expensive enough to make an invoice blush, sent the sulk through a baffle and the sulk forgot that it had ever been a plan.\n\nHe went for the crowd then, which he had never dared because crowds can become something else if you get the scale wrong. He pointed the brush into the tide of women and men and teenagers who had decided that evening that they would practice being a river, and he found that fabric does what mirrors do not: it forgives. The black clung where it landed but it didn\u2019t stay like a thought you can never shake. It smeared into motion and the motion became its own argument. The volunteers wore clothes they had rehearsed in: slicker fabric, old acrylic sweaters that did not keep stains the way a mother keeps grudges, skirts with panels that caught air. A mister hissed where a ceiling tile had been levered out, and the water fell not in big humiliations but in thin, unspectacular lines that you could mistake for a leak if you wanted to. It was enough. His hum turned into what it might have been once before someone told him he was interesting: a habit.\n\nHe dropped the brush when it remembered its first job again, a little too dramatically, like a bad actor\u2019s idea of surrender. The handle bounced on the belt and went skittering down it and three hands reached to pluck it aside before someone fell. He had an umbrella in his coat, which would have made him ridiculous if ridiculous were not often a glove that fits evil perfectly, and he yanked it open in an arc that pushed two people to their heels. The water somewhere described a curve, not dramatic, not even particularly pretty, and struck the umbrella\u2019s skin with a tiny percussion that belonged to summer porches. The black on the umbrella sulked and ran toward the ribs and gathered there into the sort of little puddles that cannot be seen from far. He looked smaller. He always had, a geometry of confidence rather than of height, but this was new: the light in the room had learned him and it kept its opinion.\n\nThey did not catch him. If this were the kind of story where triumph feels like a parade, they would have. A manager with a badge in a clip on his belt would have stepped forward with cuffs and the crowd would have made that applause that tells everyone we are grateful not because we are safe but because we have remembered a rule. He found a seam in the event the way a mouse finds one in a sack of grain, and he went through it with a quickness that took years off him. He left his umbrella open and the janitor with the stitched name lifted it in both hands like a small overturned boat and carried it as if it might bite. The belts ran for another twenty minutes just because it felt good to let something we had asked to do a job keep doing it after the reason had wandered off. The maintenance crew took apart the trap with the tenderness of men who have been mocked for their bulk and know the truth about delicacy, and what they put in a bag to send to a lab looked like the lint that dryers spit out when whole families have been washing clothes all day.\n\nAfterwards, the airport director sat on a bench with Mr. Winn and let her head fall back to look at the ceiling, which was dull and dimpled like the underbelly of a whale in photographs. \u201cI hate that we did something smart,\u201d she said, and then clarified, because she was an honest woman when allowed to be: \u201cI hate that we had to.\u201d Mr. Winn said nothing because it is not polite to tell a person: you are living the moment when you discover that competence is merely the beginning. Indira handed out cups because she had insisted on bringing them, because she had written Bring cups! in pen on a flyer and pens are for this. Arkady sat on the floor in a way that suggested her bones were jointed differently than other people\u2019s and rubbed her eyes under her glasses with the heel of her hand like a person bargaining with a headache. C\u00f4t\u00e9 took a call he did not want and afterward he said to no one and everyone: he\u2019ll try the dam or he\u2019ll try the places where wheels never stop. \u201cWe cannot flood a bridge,\u201d someone said, and Mr. Winn said, \u201cMaybe we can.\u201d\n\nHe went to the river that night because he had nowhere else to go that would speak to him without sarcasm. The water looked up at him with its usual attention span, which is to say it did not hold a grudge and it did not forget. He stared at the dam and thought as hard as he could, which was a kind of apology, a child\u2019s offering of effort. He imagined a dozen ways to make a wound in it and his mind lapped at each the way a tongue laps at a sore tooth. A man came and stood twenty yards away and put a cigarette in his mouth and then did not light it. They shared the silence the way two dogs share the shade of a small tree: without making rules about it. He thought about leaving because men like him always think there is a city somewhere that will not make them work this hard for attention. He imagined deserts. He liked the word because it didn\u2019t ask you to learn the trick of its spelling until too late and he appreciated any word that resented correction.\n\nAt home, Mr. Winn told her kitchen about conveyance because kitchens are where movement begins in a house, in pots, in kettles, in drawers that slide because someone cared enough to get the rails right. They had learned to run water through the evening and to make light misbehave. They had learned to be a crowd that did not become mob. She made a list that had no bullets because this was not war and yet had the smell of it. She wrote: belts, fans, lungs. She wrote: buses lower for old bones\u2014ask the drivers to linger the way they do when the woman with a walker needs a second. She wrote: the dam is not an enemy; it is a rhythm that can be interrupted without revenge. She wrote: the story is a river too; stop feeding it names and the fish will have to learn to eat plants. Her hand hurt when she\u2019d finished and she pressed the heel of it into her own palm and felt the pulse that had been Teddy\u2019s and thought about what it means for an old body to return to a fight one last time and find it still knows every step.\n\nLenka came as lightly as a letter when she did, months late and exactly on time, and the knock she made on the door was the sort made by someone who has calculated the cost of being turned away and will still call it a bargain if it happens. She stood on the thresh and two women whose hair remembered different climates looked each other into the present. They did not hug because there are reunions that deserve patience, and because both of them had learned that any abruptness invites the body to do things it will later resent. They sat because sitting is a discipline. Lenka\u2019s face had made decisions without asking her, which is what faces do when we turn our attention to the state of the world and away from mirrors. \u201cConveyors,\u201d she said, and laughed until her eyes found water that had nothing to do with misters. \u201cYou always did take my homework too seriously,\u201d Mr. Winn answered, and their tea was exactly the right temperature, as if a cue had been thrown from a booth.\n\nThe night market returned like a child who has learned a new word it can\u2019t stop repeating, and the organizers threaded lines above the stalls that tugged bits of foil in breeze. The dumpling cart steamed its offerings like small fogs and young men in shirts with sleeves rolled carefully to the elbow leaned beside it trying to remember why they had decided this was handsome. The bus shelter at the edge had a different photograph in it now, a picture of a woman in a hard hat smiling not at the camera but at something to its left, as if she were getting a joke no one had told and it still amused her. He stood across the street and weighed the market with his eyes the way an angler weighs a stream, and then he did something that nearly hurt her more than the things he had loved to do. He turned away. He did not want to perform where the stage had learned him. He wanted a new audience, though he would never admit that the word he really meant was victim. The city felt the way you feel when you see a hawk change course; it means salvation for some small birds and it means later for others.\n\nThey practiced silence in a way that nearly felt religious if you did not bring God to it. The drop pins multiplied but they did not add glitter to themselves, which was a kind of discipline that impressed Mr. Winn. People filmed less; or if they filmed, they handed their footage to Stoneflower without posting, and the site accepted the work the way a river accepts a piece of bread thrown to it by a toddler who believes in ducks. The anchors learned a new tone\u2014one that reported without rendering\u2014and when a woman in a newsroom slipped and said his name, her cohost touched her forearm lightly to say: remember, we have learned not to feed the river with that. The police, who had been forced by their funding and by their pride into pretending that water curtains were not part of law, began to carry hose couplers with the same absentminded ease with which they had always carried pens. In the laundromat, they pinned a new schedule near the coin machine, not of washing cycles but of shifts for the misters near the university tunnel, and the sound of quarters dropping into the slot had never been so companionable.\n\nHe went inland in his mind. He stood in a warehouse where boxes moved on belts he could not see the ends of and thought about what it would be like to make those belts hate themselves. He imagined painting the packages not with black but with the habit of hesitation. He lifted the brush and he drew a line on the metal lip of a chute and for a split second the line pretended it had a future. Then the chute shook the way a throat does when laughter will not be held and the line fractured, ran, and became a question that did not want his answer. He put the brush to the floor and felt ridiculous and did not like the feeling and did it again in spite of himself because sometimes practice is just cruelty that cannot climb. He was not a man given to private prayers, but he discovered a superstition in himself that had been waiting for an invitation: he began to walk with his palm pressed to things that held motion and to feel for their pulse, as if he could borrow it.\n\nMr. Winn dreamed of rivers whose names she had known when she was young and studying geography not because she believed in empire but because she understood that if you are going to fight anything you ought to know its shape. The Volta braided itself with the Grand, and a creek that had been nothing but a dysfunction behind her childhood school offered her a gold coin it made out of a pop-top. She woke with the sentence that she had disliked when it came in a textbook: calculate your losses now so that you will not be surprised. She put coffee on because she could and she sat at the table because it was there and she used a pen that had trouble starting because the ink had been allowed to think too long and she made two columns. On one side, she wrote what he had not yet done, because even monsters have boundaries they do not know they honor. On the other, she wrote what they had learned to do not because any of them were brave but because practice had made them competent. In the middle, she left a strip of paper blank and didn\u2019t name it anything, because sometimes you have to leave the river a place to run that is not through your house.\n\nWhen the rain came, it came wrong. It came sideways first, and then it came in the tight fists that make gutters forget their jobs. It came hard enough that a woman on television said the word biblical without irony and then apologized to no one because she had meant it. The dam held in the way good engineering does, which is to say it did not ask to be admired. Downstream the river took liberties it had not asked permission for in years. A man in a red car stalled his engine in the middle of the underpass and it looked for all the world like an expensive toy being baptized against its will. Volunteers moved their misters into basements and pointed them at stairwells because there is no rule that says a river cannot run up for a while if you give it a little help. He stood on a bridge that the city had not thought to test with the elegance of feet and remembered that he had once laughed at the idea that water could be asked to do a job.\n\nIt was never a victory. That would have required the neatness of endings and this was an age of edits. It was, instead, a ritual they learned to keep. Volunteers with cups, and a patch of foil in a child\u2019s backpack that made a bright constant noise as he ran, and a traffic cop who turned hydrants at the quarter hour the way he\u2019d been told and added a minute because he could feel in his knee that the dark was near. It was an old woman with a cane who did not change the city so much as she taught it to use a set of muscles it had not known it still had. It was a man who had mistaken hunger for map learning to stand in doorways he used to stride through and feel, for the first time in his adult life, the press of other people\u2019s pace against his own. It was a story that had thought itself a river learning it could be dammed by silence, by misters, by the sound of a bus lowering a knee for bones and lifting again. It was not enough. It was, which is what the world offers most days, more than yesterday and hard-won.Chapter 6\n\nSpring came in increments that felt like a child counting too fast, and the city tried to keep up without spraining anything important. Leaves went from coins to hands. Potholes blossomed with the annual arrogance of things that know you will forgive them because you must. The river moved from a winter sermon to a conversational tone, and in its voice you could hear the work of all those small pumps and misters and buckets that had been enlisted into a militia nobody had planned on forming. Mr. Winn had a new way of keeping time, a practice that would have made her former self roll her eyes, and it went like this: how many buses bowed for bones today, how many hydrants sighed for six minutes, how many belts hummed their quiet hymn. Numbers gave her nerves a place to sit. They stayed on their chairs more often now.\n\nIn the council chamber with its bad flags and its chairs that seemed designed to make backs suspicious of sitting, she sat at a microphone and did not let her hands perform. The councilor who liked to be first had introduced her as a citizen scientist which was not a thing she was and yet had its uses in that room. She had put on a jacket that could pretend to authority and had tucked her cane up beside the desk so as not to let anyone offer to help her with what she did not need help with. \u201cWe are not at war with water,\u201d she said, and heard in her own voice the old teacher who could insist a problem had a solution because the children would be safer if they believed it. \u201cWe are not at war with him, either, if you mean by war that we make him larger to feel ourselves brave. This is a maintenance problem. It is a city problem. It is the problem of keeping things moving when fear would like to stop them.\u201d She laid out her lists in the language of budgets because that is a dialect politicians will always meet you in a hallway to speak. When she reached the part where she asked for the sprinklers in the underpass to be switched from ornamental to tactical, the councilor who wore disapproval like a starched shirt sighed audibly and asked about costs like a man who has never met a life that counted more than a line of numbers. She did not tell him that he had miscounted his own value; she explained graywater again with the patience of someone who would prefer not to die on this hill and then die anyway if required.\n\nAfterward in the hallway, the first-to-know councilor confided that a marketing firm had approached her about the drops. \u201cWe could make it a campaign,\u201d the woman said, showing the whites of her eyes the way nervous horses do when a plastic bag blows in a yard. \u201cWe could put sponsors on the misters. We could sell branded umbrellas that actually catch the\u2014\u201d and then she stopped because even she could hear the word and its weight. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to tell you this kindly,\u201d Mr. Winn said, and realized she didn\u2019t much care whether kindness was necessary, \u201cbut you cannot merchandise a boundary. Leave us the plainness of it. Let the drops be unhandsome. Let there be no mascot.\u201d The woman nodded the way people nod when they have already chosen, and Mr. Winn could see the pins with their gloss finish and their tidy fonts, and she could see also the first fundraiser held under a tent in a gated backyard while gardeners made the hedges pretend to be forest. She went home more tired than she had expected to be.\n\nTiredness, which had always been a companion, learned a new trick. It found her in bright places and asked to sit in her lap. She could be content one minute arranging the bowls in the drainer by size\u2014the geometry of drying a religion she had never betrayed\u2014and the next her heart would write its old skipping signature so elaborately that her hands would go cold. The doctor\u2019s warning about best companions needing to go quiet occasionally came back like a tune she didn\u2019t like but could not stop humming. On a Tuesday that had promised to be ordinary from the way the radio announcer said the name of the month, she set a cup down on the table too hard and the sound made a hole in her attention large enough that she had to sit before the floor remembered it was not a lake. Indira came with a kind firm mouth and a set of keys in her hand as if she might need to drive a thought somewhere that couldn\u2019t get there on its own. They went to the clinic and the nurse at the counter said, \u201cHi, Mr. Winn,\u201d in that easy way that says I am not going to argue with anyone\u2019s name, and they orchestrated a day out of blood pressure cuffs and a machine that recorded heartbeats with a pencil that was not a pencil. She watched the pencil make the mountain range of her chest on paper and wondered how many peaks an old woman is allowed.\n\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 met them in the lobby because his beat now included any place where the city\u2019s air changed its mind. He held the elevator for them with a hand that refused to be dramatic about it and they rode up in a box where the mirror had no bruises, only a film you could not see, and the smudge of someone's hand that had been wiped away by a person who would go home after midnight and sleep with their socks on. \u201cHe came,\u201d the guard said from the desk where the calls make their low tide noise. \u201cHe came and he tried to make the door forget itself and it did not.\u201d They watched the security footage because that\u2019s what we do when the world has found a way to imitate myth; we seek proof in pixels and in the slowed-down version where sometimes you can catch intention in the way a shoulder lifts. He looked the same as he always did\u2014merely large, the way a resented chore is large\u2014and he did the same thing he always did, the not-touch that is a violation precisely because it doesn\u2019t need your skin. The door remembered itself. It remembered the joke of the hydrophilic film. It remembered that it was the kind of door that would always open for a woman with a folded sweater and a paper with a lab number on it and that it would sulk and refuse him as long as the city fed it that memory. He held his two fingers on the glass for a long time, as if he had found a nerve in it he could hold, and then he laughed, not loudly, just enough to make the light in the camera wobble as if laughter had mass. He left without a flourish, the worst insult he could give to his own appetite.\n\nThe night after, Stoneflower organized what Arkady insisted on calling the Hush Walk, a phrase that made Mr. Winn wince until she saw what the words had bought them. No signs, because slogans are bait. No chant, because chants want microphones. They walked the usual route that protests take through the downtown, that strangely ceremonial line that makes a city remember where its edges are. They wore foil that bent the light with all the subtlety of a cheap disco, not because anyone wanted to be festive but because it unsettled his shadow\u2019s certainty about where to lay its head. They carried cups because Indira had written it on a flyer and because a woman in the third row had brought a thermos of broth and had learned that if you offer a thing hot and honest enough people will throw away their pride. Children wheeled those little fans on sticks that spin themselves silly and their parents made faces like they were worried about readiness and then stopped because readiness is a habit that either grows or doesn't and fear has never watered it properly. The only noise besides feet and the small machines was the bus that kneeled at each stop along the route even when no one asked because the driver was in on it and because mercy, when it practices, makes rituals beautiful.\n\nHe did not show himself that night, which did not mean he wasn\u2019t there. He had learned to study the city the way a predator studies the waterholes on a nature program, the careful patience that is really just a refusal to work harder than hunger demands. He watched the foil make the shadows jitter and remembered boys with cameras at concerts holding their phones up like rosaries to music they believed in without knowing what belief costs. He walked parallel to them three streets over and hummed his wrong hymn and let the black he wore dribble onto the walls of a quiet lane where no one would see until morning, the vandalism equivalent of muttering. A man sweeping his stoop along that lane stepped accidentally into the run of it and found that his boot did not carry the mess the way tar would have. He was spared the humiliation of tracking a stain into his kitchen, and he went inside and told no one because he did not yet know it was a story. The city learned in those little unwitnessed mercies as much as in any coordinated act.\n\nMr. Winn\u2019s granddaughter came to one Hush Walk with a friend whose jacket was the loud yellow of an idea you refuse to let anyone squint at and their hands stayed near each other not because they were afraid but because contact is a river too. They walked beside Mr. Winn for a block and a half and then went ahead in the natural rhythm of young and old bodies, and a thing happened that Mr. Winn would have called coincidence if she had not been in a season when coincidence felt like instrument. The mist from a mister caught the light from a streetlamp and made a veil across an alley mouth and in that veil stood a shadow waiting to be invited to be bold. It reached for her girl with an old reflex and found itself hesitating, not because of the water alone but because her girl was moving with other girls, a small crowd, and the tide of them would have made any paint choose to cling to one and not another and the indecision killed it. The black hesitated, faltered, sought a surface larger than a pocket, and then slunk back to his boots as if embarrassed. Later the granddaughter sent three messages with no words and a picture of the alley and a sentence: it was smaller when we were together, and perhaps this is what coming of age looks like under new rules.\n\nWhen the first branded drop pins showed up on a city employee\u2019s lanyard six weeks later, they were plain enough that the temptation to sneer passed without incident. The firm, it turned out, had contained within it a woman who had understood the assignment. The pins were matte. They did not glint. They had a small scratchable texture that made anxious hands calm down, and inside the pin behind the enamel a very cheap disc of foil moved when you moved, only a little, only enough to make light misbehave microscopically. The councilor who had wanted mascots sent an email saying see? and Arkady sent back three words that had the weight of a poem: you did not ruin. Later, at a farmer\u2019s market that had become an impromptu clinic for useful things, Mr. Winn watched a man who had worked a night shift rub his thumb over one of those drops and put his shoulders down an inch and buy tomatoes that were too expensive and go home to sleep with less noise in his hair.\n\nThe man they had refused to name discovered that being thwarted repeatedly was not as interesting as he had hoped, and something in him that had practiced waiting went bad. He grew sloppy. In a library where the air is always cool in the way of places that harbor memory, he slid two fingers along a display case holding a map of the city drawn when millers and Mennonites had first agreed about bridges. The black tried to make the paper forget itself and failed in the precise square where the volunteer on duty had wiped it that morning with a cloth dipped in a little diluted detergent and water and a little prayer uttered beneath a breath. He did not like defeat in corners. He shied from that square the way animals learn to shy from electric fences when the shock has no poetry and therefore is terrifying. He went for the plexiglass instead and watched the swirls of his not-paint bunch at the fasteners and then retreat as if legal counsel had been called.\n\nThere was talk of drought. The weather app rearranged its icons into a gallery of suns that had no right to be smug, and people at bus stops said, \u201cWell, at least we\u2019ll have the beach,\u201d in that false-bright tone that always accompanies small preemptive submissions. Public Works sent another letter. Use less, it said again, and this time the people with hoses made faces because they had grown to love the feeling of agency you get when water leaves you on purpose. Mr. Winn looked at her lists and felt that familiar clutch in her chest that is not fear but math, the calculation of what can be spared. She made a plan with Arkady that involved the thing they had learned at the airport: moving boundaries do not require volume. She wrote letters to the building supers and to the custodians whose respect she had always coveted more than a principal\u2019s and she explained fans and foil and bead curtains in the language of maintenance and utility and cleaning budgets, and the custodians loved her not because she made their work glamourous but because she had noticed that theirs is the labor upon which any ritual stands. They set box fans at the mouths of corridors and hung light chains of reflective strips a child had cut from Mylar blankets in an art class from hooks that had been bored long ago for Christmas wreaths. The air became a river lazy enough not to be wasteful and noisy enough to unsettle shadow.\n\nHe tried to be clever and went to the parks not for the women but for the monuments, an escalation hidden in taste. He dragged his brush along a bronze shoe the size of a dog and watched the black slip and fail and gather in a seam where a sculptor had offered it shelter. He liked the idea of mocking metal because metal pretends to permanence, and he drew a line up the side of a soldier issued by history for pious purposes. There, too, the city had anticipated him, not with film but with the simplest of all acts: washing. A boy in a volunteer\u2019s vest sprayed the statue with a bottle that had once held cleaner for kitchens and the black did that little soundless pop that meant it had gotten confused about what surface it was on. He turned and there in the distance he saw foil ribbon in birches and Mylar fish hung from a line like holiday in a language no one speaks anymore. His hum drooped. He had not expected tree-light to betray him.\n\nAt night, when she allowed herself the old bad habit of imagining conversation with a person who had harmed her city, she stopped offering him education and began offering him boredom. She pictured saying: we will not chase you. We will not film you. We will maintain without telling you. You will find doors that do not love you and corridors that breathe wrong and rails that are always a little damp when you are near. She would prefer to leave him to his hunger rather than feed it with outrage like sugar water. She did not try the speech on the air because speaking out loud has gravity; it pulls worlds into being. She spoke it into the steam above her kettle and felt the plea go up with it, a small weather making a roof under the big weather. Then she turned off the radio because even voices she trusted had begun to speculate again, and speculation is delicious and lazy and makes you feel like you have done something when you have not.\n\nLenka, who had come and stayed as if the city were a sofa you can nap on regardless of who pays the rent, wrote her third note at the table without ceremony. The ribbon of typing had become more exhausted; the e looked chewed by a mouse. Breath is a river if you let it be, she wrote, and smiled that the page could hold a sentence so silly and so exact at the same time. Mr. Winn thought about lungs and about the fans and about the whisper at the airport and she thought about the first time she had been told to blow out a candle on a birthday cake and had not understood until her father had bent his head and demonstrated and had grinned at her because men with grease on their fingers get to be tender only when something needs teaching that looks like a trick. She met Arkady at the pool and they watched the humidity rise on the glass like intent and they tested again with a line and a breath and found that exhale is not water but is disobedient enough to be useful. They taught the volunteers the trick of breathing across a threat and laughed because it felt like magic when it was only physics and felt like prayer when it was only practice repeated until the body adopts it.\n\nHe tried the tunnels beneath the university because he had once been young there and had learned to be lonely in exactly those fluorescent corridors. He had sworn not to return because vows are another kind of hunt for attention, and he went anyway because hunger breaks not just laws but self-respect. The air was not right. It moved in a way that made his darkness let go with tiny reluctant noises even though no one human could hear them. It shifted with the implacability of a schedule. Bead curtains said silly to his eye and then took from him the certainty he had in his own outline. Students walked by with their heads in midterms and their hands on straps of backpacks and he reached for one and his own shadow favored the bead curtain instead and slid along it, furtive and caught, like a lizard on a hot day choosing a line of shade and finding it ambush. He took the stair and the mechanical breath of the building met him in the air at his face and he had the first honest thought he had had in years: I am not wanted here. He had known it before. He felt it now at the level of blood.\n\nWhen Indira\u2019s niece made the poster about conveyances with little drawings of belts and fans and buses and breath, they put it up in the laundromat and in the vestibule at the clinic and at the checkout at Wachowski\u2019s dumplings and in the locker room at the pool where children learned to be fish in water that professionals call too cold and mothers call fine. The poster was not art and was not design; it was instruction wearing its only good clothes. People took pictures of it to send to parents in cities where the dark had found new homes and those parents wrote back with the tone of people who have been thrown a rope and are too proud to say thank you and too human not to mean it. One city added bicycle wheels to the list and strung foil through the spokes and told their couriers and their gig economy and their kids to keep pedaling, keep moving, keep the boundary as river. A woman in a town where the river had been entombed under streets went into the tunnels and stood at a grate and felt the air that had once been water and told the air what she needed from it with the authority of a person who has been told no more times than math should allow.\n\nThere were setbacks and they did not give them headlines because headlines grew the wrong seeds. A basement flooded with ordinary water and the woman who lived there sat on her stairs and cried because she had had enough now of metaphors turning literal. A sprinkler jammed and a boy slipped and his wrist had a story to tell it hadn\u2019t asked for. A vendor at the night market doused a line of foil fish with a hose and sheeted a woman who had not wanted to be wet and the apology was not graceful and the two women did not like each other for a week. The man who had been the center of this learned to come from the side, his favorite trick, and at dawn one morning put lines of not-paint in the place where the path narrows past the canal and three joggers stamped through it and one of them did not notice until she got home because sometimes you do not notice until after and then the fury is for your own attention as much as for the indifference of strangers. The city corrected where it could and learned to say we cannot fix that one and learned to say it with the right amount of regret and no glamour.\n\nThere was talk, again, of names. Journalists like to write referents. Parents of daughters wanted to know what to tell their children to call him so that the danger could be contained by a syllable the way childhood monsters are. Arkady wrote a fragment on Stoneflower and the thread took it and fed it and sent it back undistorted, which doesn\u2019t happen often enough to be taken for granted: call the acts, not the actor. Call the harm, not the man. Call the habit, not the myth. Mr. Winn added for herself: call your friends before you go out at night and tell them which route is the one with the misters and the fans. The radio learned to say incident. The anchors learned to say interruption. The city learned to argue about nothing for a news cycle and then forget in favor of whether the dumpling cart should be moved nearer the entrance. Mr. Winn allowed herself the small luxury of getting bored of the right things.\n\nHe went to a church on a Tuesday afternoon when the light pours through windows only maintenance sees, and he sat in the back where men who do not trust themselves to be seen go. The holy water had become less obliging; the bowl sweated in a way it did not used to, and the priest who wore a collar that had not yet wilted nodded at him without invitation and did not stand on ceremony, which is its own ceremony. He put his hand near the surface and his shadow came off like a coat and tried to lie on the water and the water did not accept the burden, which is perhaps the closest thing to grace the city had witnessed in months. There was silence of a sort that has velocity and he understood without feeling that understanding in his mind that the thing he had loved most about himself\u2014the obedience of his tool, the way it made the world more compliant\u2014had been sold out by an element that had too many birthdays for anyone to count. He pulled back and he left, and the priest added no notch to any weapon and did not count coup and only wrote, on paper older than the computer in his office, a sentence about how the church had done an ordinary thing on a day that had asked for one.\n\nMr. Winn\u2019s heart did its show on a day when the heat had tried to be more interesting than it deserved, and she sat at her window and breathed like she had taught dormitory girls to breathe during exams. Slow in, say hello to the edges. Slower out, tell the body there is more time than it thinks. Indira came without knocking and put a glass of water in her hand and a damp cloth at the back of her neck and did not ask whether she had taken any pills because questions sometimes lie down across the doorway and make what you need to do a step higher. It passed in the way storms pass after scaring you into naming your gods, and when she could count to sixty without losing track she said, \u201cI would like to plant something,\u201d in a tone that startled even her because she had not expected to want anything that large again. They went to the roof because the garden down the block had wait lists longer than desire and because the roof was where buckets collect rain and where women keep bats they are not supposed to have. They put basil into a plastic tub that had once held sports equipment no one needed, and when they watered it they did it with a zeal that would have made a saint blush. The basil did not mind the mixed motives. It took what was offered and tried leaves because trying is what plants do.\n\nHe tried, once, to speak. Not because anything had softened in him or in the city but because the hunger for attention is a sister to the hunger for confession; both are mouths. He stood on a platform not far from where he had once drawn lines on concrete for children to hop and he opened his actual mouth. \u201cYou live like you deserve to,\u201d he said to no one in particular, and then waited for the thrill he had expected to feel in himself and did not. Two teens in the shelter pretended they had not smiled at each other a moment before, and a man with a paper bag of groceries read each of the ingredients on the back of a cereal box because that list demanded more loyalty than a madman\u2019s sermon. He tried again, and he said, \u201cYou make your little lights,\u201d not as a taunt but as a diagnosis, and the words met the hydrophilic film and slid down and pooled on the sill and had the decency to vanish without theater. He did not shout. He did not perform. He left, and the bus came, and the driver lowered the bus and the woman with the walker stepped on without needing anyone to clap.\n\nLenka brought her a book of river names. It had been put from print somewhere in the decade when publishers had forgotten that there was such a thing as quite a lot of people who liked to remember geography for its own sake. They sat with it and an index card and they took turns saying the names out loud and wondering whether their mouths made a kind of river when they did. \u201cOrinoco,\u201d Lenka said, and the O\u2019s made their lips into boats. \u201cSaskatchewan,\u201d Mr. Winn said, and the consonants went on little journeys between teeth. They did not pretend it was medicine. They let it be the comfort it was. Later that night Mr. Winn slept and dreamed a map on which the drop pins were not pins at all but mouths of springs, and when she woke she felt a stupid tenderness for the pipes in the walls. She told the radiator how much she appreciated its civic attitude. She told the sink she valued its valves. She refrained from telling the toilet anything because the toilet had been forced to play too many roles lately and deserved a day free of symbolism.\n\nIt did not end because things do not. There were weeks where the graphs leaned south and weeks where they hesitated at the zero line like swimmers at the end of a lane not sure whether to make the turn or rest a hand on the wall. There were mornings when the radio\u2019s voice had relief braided into it with the traffic and the farm report and there were evenings when a friend texted a photo of a smear near a transit stop and the old thud in Mr. Winn\u2019s chest was both the heart and the dread and the readiness passing a baton. The city forgot in places and remembered in others. A boy grew up. A woman retired from the maintenance crew and went to visit her sister and got off the bus where his shadow had thought it might stage a resurrection and instead found a mister and a volunteer with a bad pun and no blush and she laughed and thought of buying tomatoes she could not afford and bought them anyway. Mr. Winn watered the basil in the morning and poured a line from her thermos in the evening as she walked home, not because she expected to meet a story on the sidewalk but because ritual had taught her that light likes to be shown where to rest. She was not a hero and she did not want to be. She was a person with a list and a thermos and a city that had learned to put its muscles to work again, which, for this chapter, would be enough.Chapter 7\n\nThe heat arrived like a houseguest who had packed for a week and stayed the season, dragging its luggage through every room and setting down a damp towel on each chair. The radio tried to make a calendar out of it and failed, its voices flattening into a weather that sounded like admonition disguised as forecast. Public Works hung banners on overpasses with the bad fonts of municipal urgency and the good intentions of people who have supervised sewer relines at dawn. Use less, they said, as if thrift were a religion to be practiced suddenly in the face of a bored god. On Stoneflower, a thread that had been about misters and moving curtains grew a second vine alongside it about air, not as metaphor but as medium. They built wind from parts, box fans borrowed from bedrooms, refurbished pedestal fans that remembered the smell of old offices, bicycle wheels that learned to be pinwheels because a boy from a shop on Water Street taught them, and the city grew a quiet machinery that did not want applause. Air moved in doorways, on stair landings, along the mouths of tunnels and in the long throats of corridors, and his black found itself unsettled without anybody having to reach for a tap.\n\nSmoke came from far prairie and from mountains that had never once in their lifetimes asked this town for anything. It arrived at the speed of wind and had none of wind\u2019s humor. It made a new sky over their old one, a bruised tent pinned low. Children learned the language of AQI quickly and earnestly, reciting numbers like points in a game they refused to lose, and put on masks with the ease of new natives to calamity. The night market laid out its foil fish and its misters and then rolled them back halfway because lungs have their own councils where motions are not carried without debate. He liked the smoke because it made the world as he preferred it\u2014less distance, less depth, the edges uncertain the way a liar\u2019s story is, indistinct enough to make a myth feel like a fact. He took the elevated walkway near the mall as his platform not because it was grand but because nobody looks up when their eyes are stung. He pressed two fingers to the glass and encountered the film the city had applied with the quiet tenacity of people who know how to put up bulletin boards straight and level. The smoke condensed on it in tiny beads and ran, the water\u2019s quiet vote cast against him even on a day when taps were discouraged.\n\nMr. Winn learned to put her breath to work as if it were a tool she had inherited and never thought to oil. Lenka showed her the trick at the pool and they took it into the laundromat where practice had made everything honest. They stood two yards from the plexi that protected the bulletin board full of notices that were sentences pretending to be lifelines\u2014my cat, my sublet, my band needs\u2014and they breathed across a small smear that someone had planted there with fingers that liked to think of themselves as instruments. It thinly unmade itself in the time it takes to blow out three birthday candles, which felt like an old rhythm returned for a sensible reason. They taught it at the Hush Walks when the smoke made the city take its quiet more seriously; people stood six feet apart because now they understood that spacing wasn\u2019t a fashion but a way to give air dignity, and when the smear presented itself at a kiosk near the park\u2019s dry fountain, a dozen people leaned forward and breathed like a choir told to favor the outgoing line of the phrase. The black did not enjoy being sung at. It did not know how to survive attention that came as exhale rather than as eyes.\n\nAt the council, the drought brought out men who have always had more opinions than gardens. They spoke about waste in tones usually reserved for scandal, and one of them used the phrase bathers at the public trough with the flourish of a man who has been waiting years to get away with saying it. The woman from Public Works who had teeth that met like careful gears explained graywater again and again until her own mouth wanted washing. Mr. Winn sat with her old jacket pretending to authority and spoke in the clean arithmetic the room couldn\u2019t pretend not to understand. It is volume multiplied by speed, she said, and then gave them the units because men love units when they dislike the conclusions a thing asks of them. It is ounces and seconds and square footage, all obedient when you keep them moving, all rebellious when you try to hoard them. She said fans and foil and breath and belts, and the councilor who had wanted mascots looked like a person who had been forced to learn a mathematics that did not entitle her to applaud herself. Afterward, in the hallway, the Public Works woman put her hand on Mr. Winn\u2019s forearm and said, \u201cI printed your list,\u201d in a voice that had sleep in it and gratitude\u2019s salt at the corners.\n\nHer heart had decided to be less coy with its skipping. Teddy, as the doctor had let it be named, sent notes at inconvenient hours, and one afternoon while the smoke put a stain on the horizon that looked like news she didn\u2019t want, Teddy sat down and refused for eight long seconds to stand. She found the chair by the window the way a swimmer finds the side and she rode out the cold that comes when your blood tries to teach you something. Indira arrived with a glass that was half water, half brothering tone\u2014drink this for me, don\u2019t argue\u2014and sat on the edge of the table watching her friend not die, the deeply practical drama that women conduct in kitchens. When it had passed, when the pencil mountain range the EKG made had finished its brief impression of the Rockies, they let C\u00f4t\u00e9 come up and scold them both with his eyebrows. He pretended to be amused by the bus blanket still on the back of the chair and then failed to pretend, which made him more beautiful than he had ever been. He told a story about his mother and rain. It was almost nothing, and therefore it was the only thing that helped. She had set a coffee tin outside the back door during drought weeks and when rain\u2019s first coins sounded on the tin she had called all her sons and made them listen on purpose. \u201cThis is what mercy sounds like,\u201d she had said to boys who had deserved better than that one lesson and were fortunate to have received it nevertheless.\n\nThe museum that had survived a century by calling its halls rotation and letting the students rearrange its placards invited the city to an exhibit about water with a title that was too clever by half. He could not resist grand old rooms where whispers behave, where the hush has wood behind it and the floors remember being trees. He came with his hum like a mosquito in woodwork and drifted through dioramas where women in aprons pumped plastic handles and men in hats pointed at the river as if only fingers could make it obey. The volunteers had come in their niceness and their refusal to be fooled, and in the bag of one of them lay a sprayer that had been labeled with tape and marker stop for no reason except an old darkroom pun that felt like a cousin to an exorcism. He reached for the display case that held blueprints of the dam, his brush poised to take credit for a thing other men had built. The humidity in the room, managed by machines that had nothing to do with him and everything to do with the swell and shrink of old paper, took his not-paint from the bristles and made it forget, elegantly. It beaded at the joins. It sulked in the seams. The volunteer breathed across it and then sprayed the tiniest of veils, and someone at the far side of the room, a stranger with an ordinary face, began to explain in a quiet voice the difference between preservation and worship and the black left the case because it could not argue with sentences that had that much practice.\n\nThe nights went black not because the stars insisted but because the grid had an opinion about heat no one had thought to ask. The blackout did what blackouts do: made you hear your own appliances grieving their momentary deaths and made you slow your hands until you found every switch by the intimacy of familiarity. In the apartments with their single windows and in the shelters with their breath, people found again the companionship of candles and the ridiculousness of their danger. He liked the power\u2019s absence; he believed it vested him. He stepped into a stairwell at a parking structure and found that stairs generate their own wind when a dozen people move with purpose and forget to pretend they are alone. Foil taped to the landing strings each floor into a small night sky, and the moon, if it had bothered to come, would have been humiliated by how much light it failed to provide. The volunteers had rehearsed rehearsals. They had strings of those cheap LED lights that taste your batteries and won\u2019t let you forget it, and they wore them low, ankle-height, their glow making a river at foot level where his eyes did not want to go. He had brought a flashlight of his own, a fat thing that missionaries used to hand out to children in far away places, and he clicked it on and the light did not love him because light is not obedient when reflected multiplied into a forest of foil. He backed away from the stair\u2019s updraft and tried the elevator and met a sign taped to the door with the good blue painter\u2019s tape\u2014out, honest as breath\u2014and turned to find not a single lens raised in his direction. Indifference stung him better than water ever had.\n\nThere was, one afternoon, a scuffle of the stupid kind that tests a plan. A boy in a sloppy bandanna and exaggerated boots tried to paint the mirror of a nail salon because he had read somewhere that women keep secrets in mirrors and had misunderstood both women and secrets. He found on his first swipe that the black did not stay. The woman with the towel around her shoulders\u2014her hair a bright wet banner that said she had chosen color over weather\u2014reached without ceremony for the bottle she used to spray her plants. She wrote the boy\u2019s face into a water and the boy yelped not out of pain but out of humiliation and she did not prolong it because women have better things to do. The copycat ran, the door chimed in its idiot way, and everyone went back to their stories, and in the lore of a city that learns by repetition and not by decree, the nail salon became a nice paragraph.\n\n\u201cYour granddaughter wants to take your class,\u201d Indira said, always more dangerous than a knock, and Mr. Winn had to sit with the sentence because class is a word that implies desks and chalk and edges that deserve roll call. \u201cWhat does she want to learn,\u201d she asked, startled that her mouth had used the present tense as if she were an institution. \u201cCounting,\u201d Indira said, as if that were an immense act of optimism. They sat with it and did not make it grand. The girl came on a Thursday with a notebook that had been bought with hope, and they put columns on paper again, not the kind that folks with power protect with money, the kind that protect the mind with occupation. What do we do when the water fails us, the header asked, and they put under it things that were not water and a few that were but in different clothes: fans, breath, foil ribbons that made the air larky, a habit of moving slowly enough that a hallway\u2019s draft could be courted. In the next column they wrote what we do for the water that does not fail us, and then they named faucets with addresses, hoses coiled near stairs, buckets set under roof corners for when the gutters sulked. The girl made a third column that neither of them had asked for: who to tell. She listed names and places not to call the press or the police but the people who sweep the stoops and the woman at the pool and the maintenance man whose shirt had a stitched name and a pride that did not wear badly.\n\nHe tried new edges because men such as he always mistake novelty for strategy. The old cinema reopened on a bet with bankruptcy and goodwill and he could not resist its lobby\u2019s cracked tile and the posters that offered women from other decades to this one\u2019s eyes like gifts. He stood under the chandelier, a cheap thing that had learned to pretend it was crystal, and he raised his brush toward a still life of faces set to kiss in a world where nothing went wrong for long. The manager, a young person who wore a ring in their lip like an punctuation mark that meant their own rules, walked up beside him and breathed with a small disdain. The air moved lightly in the lobby because someone had put a fan behind the candy counter where the popcorn machine told its creation myth, and the breeze insisted with a politeness that unstitched the trick he was about to perform. The brush trembled the way it had as a stick in the dirt by the river. He found himself using his mouth. \u201cYou think wind is all it takes,\u201d he said to the manager, and the manager said, \u201cActually, we think organics, mechanicals, and social practice in a careful braid is what it takes,\u201d and then smiled because they had been waiting all evening to say something that nutritious to someone who would not value it, and had said it anyway.\n\nThe drought pinched and the basil on the roof looked at the sun with an expression that could only be read as aside, and Mr. Winn and Indira took to carrying water up the stairs in a way that made them laugh at themselves and at gravity. They put broken tiles under the soil to keep it honest and wrote a note for the other gardeners that said please share the responsibility of thirst. A pigeon that had a sense of humor and no interest in permission came to study the tub and left its contribution on the edge, and they shrugged and thanked it because a city has its own nitrogen cycle. On a night when the smoke parted to let the moon sit closer than usual, the basil flowered, which meant it had decided to spend its remaining days on beauty and not on eating, and Mr. Winn clipped the tops and made a small pile of white and purple stars and thought about seeds as a kind of plan written in patient time.\n\nIn letters that leaned worse now because the typing ribbon in the secondhand shop had given up on its vocation, Lenka wrote about lungs. She had read papers in which words had been set badly to graphs and she had come away with only this worth bringing: breathe when it is hard as if the body is a bellows that has forgotten how to make a flame. Arkady copied the sentence to Stoneflower without attributing it because sometimes anonymity is its own kindness. The Hush Walk that week had a segment of instruction where people stood like foolish reeds and practiced breathing across their own knuckles, then across a square of plexi someone had found behind an art classroom, then toward each other\u2019s shoulders in the careful, permissioned intimacy that you only practice during changed times. The breathing made the city feel like a set of lungs that had decided to make a choir, and in a corner of a video someone had filmed that nobody would post they caught him noticing the ridiculousness and not liking the way it made him feel outdated.\n\nHe broke one rule he had kept: he spoke to a camera. It was on purpose and yet not, because he had mentored himself into believing that attention would come if he called it by name and he did not measure until too late the cost of saying syllables into a lens. He stood in the park at noon and faced a woman who had set her phone on a rail because hands are needed for other things, and he said, \u201cYou are all so busy.\u201d He said it the way a man says a thing at the end of a bar when he has just learned that people have lives without him. She did not look up. The phone kept its dignity. A child on a scooter counts for noise. The hydrophilic film on the transit map nearby shone like nothing special. He waited for his sentence to begin to do its work and when it did not he looked like somebody whose dogs would not come when called and he let his shoulders sag into a posture he had always told himself he had no need of. The woman on the bench returned to her book exactly because it had not asked anything of her, and he felt the smallest scrape of boredom\u2019s knife on the underside of his appetite.\n\nThere was a night when the grid held but the pumps in three buildings did not. The water did not come up. Elevators will tell you that news with their petulant bells, but pipes tell it with a quiet that can be mistaken for peace. Indira knocked on doors because someone had to, and Mr. Winn went floor to floor with a list and a pitcher and the stubbornness of an old woman who knew ten thousand stairs already and had no fear left to spend on three hundred more. C\u00f4t\u00e9 arrived with a case of bottles he had told his lieutenant were for a softball game that would never be played, and together they made a river rise inside a hallway. No miracle attended. Feet hurt. The pitcher slopped. A child who could not sleep watched them from the open mouth of an apartment as if the grown-ups had finally put on the show the child had dreamed of when younger. At the end of the hall a woman stepped carefully over the foolishness of a black line two nights old and Mr. Winn poured a little of her ration along the lip of it without ceremony. It lifted away from the floor like a slug forced to consider it is not the only creature to own slime.\n\nHe tried the wrong kind of river and it startled him. At the roller rink that had been resurrected through a series of prayers printed on grant applications and the bone-will of a woman in neon laces, the floor made everyone move in circles that were not quite circles. He came in with his brush and stood by the edge and considered the physics of centrifugal mean, which had never done him any favor. When he drew his line, the skaters parted around it without touching it because bodies learn spatial negotiation early when wheels are involved, and then they breathed\u2014it was that now, too\u2014and the line went thin and thinner, and a boy in a helmet too large for his head shifted to avoid a girl with a braid longer than nobody\u2019s business, and their draft made a weather he had not planned on. He licked his lip and found that he had tasted dust, not power. He left before his knees betrayed him and the DJ, an auntie with a taste for seventies basslines, let the music rise not because anyone had won but because the song needed to arrive at its chorus.\n\nThere were arguments in the laundromat because nowhere is pure. Someone said it was not their job to keep misters going in this economy. Someone else said that the drops were getting precious in a way that made them itchy. Arkady, arms full of fan blades and wires and the long patience that hides itself under competence, said, \u201cThen we stop, and we see,\u201d and the room recoiled because when you love a ritual you forget sometimes that you can put it down. They stopped for an hour in the university tunnel, an hour where students moved through the air without bead curtains clicking small songs against their shoulders, and he was with his hunger on the stairs when the hour began. He felt a thrill like he had not felt since before the river took him for the first time. He put his hand to the wall. He made his smear. The air was still because they had asked it to be. It did not last on the wall long enough for a story. Students moving have a current even without charms, and their bags made eddies and their breath made a tide, and in eight minutes the smear had become a lesson without teacher. When the hour ended, the thread on Stoneflower that had wanted to be angry chose instead to be smug in the way that helps nothing and hurts nobody, and the argument folded itself and slotted back where it had come from: hunger and fatigue, the two real devils in any civic story.\n\nAutumn had the grace to pretend it was coming even in heat. The night market sold pears that women touched as if checking them for prophecy. The buses ran their knees automatically now, a courtesy upgraded to habit, and drivers had learned to do the motion with their left hand while their right hand did any of the thousand small acts that keep a bus from being a metaphor. Mr. Winn made a will in the lazy way that suggests a person does not intend to use it soon. She wrote down who would have the marbled notebook and who would have the thermos and who would have the basil when it went to seed properly and not in a panic. She did not tell her granddaughter that she had written the girl\u2019s name on the inside cover because names confer obligation and teenagers have their own legislations about that. She put the will under the old cookbook that had been used solely as a trivet and felt the sense of it settle on her chest like a shawl she had not realized she wanted.\n\nHe walked by the dam and imagined again being the river\u2019s editor. He put his fingers on the railing and felt the vibration like the thrum of a drum skin stretched too tight, and his mind went foolish with the fantasy of control. A man with a fishing license and shoulders like history stood twenty feet away and looked at him as if to say: what will you do with that little brush here, friend? He did nothing because men like him always mistake strategy for effect, and strategy requires the kindness of time, which he had spent already. He had begun talking to himself out loud in ways that made the maintenance crews look up from their brooms and then decide, with mercy, not to make faces. He went home to a room with a too-big chair and watched videos he should not, of women being clever with water and foil and breath, and he learned to be resentful of competence, the poorest of man\u2019s hobbies.\n\nThe basil put out seed in a way that asked to be pinched and saved. Mr. Winn and her granddaughter stood in morning light with two envelopes stolen from the desk at the laundromat and the amiable theft felt like a sacrament. They rubbed the dried flowers between their fingers and the seeds fell like punctuation she would later object to if a student had used so many in a sentence. The girl wrote basil, roof, the date, and put the envelope to her nose and said it smelled like what you wish a pantry would smell like in novels. They watered with the last of the dishwater because everyone\u2019s small economies had learned to take pride in being called by their right names. They pressed the envelopes flat and tucked them into the jar where rubber bands go to die and told each other a story about next spring in the way women do when they are deliberately betting against the odds.\n\nAt the clinic the hydrophilic film on the doors had begun to grow a fringe from tiny scratches made by keys and coin edges and the rings of hands that had loved too hard. The maintenance woman took the film off with the tenderness of a nurse and put on a new sheet with a roller that had been designed by someone who loved paint and dressed modestly. Mr. Winn watched her do it and applauded with hunger she refused to call hope, because if hope hears its own name too often it grows vain. The maintenance woman said, \u201cWe do the same amount whether or not anyone notices,\u201d and Mr. Winn felt in her chest the good pain that arrives when someone says simple truth in a voice not interested in audience. They stood together afterward and looked at the glass pretending to be just glass, and both of them saw a kind of parish work where the sacrament is called attention.\n\nHe went to a sports store and bought a black umbrella because his had been taken, and when he opened it in his kitchen he felt theatrical and a little ashamed. He had lost the forest of applause he had once called a day and now he made do with oneself clapping in a kitchen with linoleum that remembered better shoes. He opened the umbrella in the park as a test and a woman in a visor told him he was inviting bad luck with an absentmindedness that felt like medicine in a pill. He walked into a wind that did not have the decency to be visible. The umbrella pulled at his arm like a stubborn pet. He folded it, unwilling to be a threat to no one\u2019s ankles, and stood with his brush and his hum and his appetite and learned that there are days when the city will let you know that you are not required, and that those days are the ones that change a man far away from any camera.\n\nIn the evening, with the heat practicing how to be less rude and the smoke pretending to belong to another continent, Mr. Winn went to the bus stop and poured a thin line along the lip of the shelter because habit is where safety sleeps. She sat and counted buses kneeling, not because anyone had asked her to keep track, but because counting, like watering basil, forces a body to put hope into a sequence. A young man offered to give up his seat and she let him because his courtesy deserved practice. The driver lowered the bus for an invisible person down the block because this too had become ritual. The girl with the sparrow tattoo from the market came by with a mister clipped to her belt like a joke and said hello, Mr., as if the world had always been this ordinary. They talked about tomatoes and about the new drop pins that didn\u2019t gleam but pleased anyway. Across the street the hydrophilic film did its work without anyone narrating it. The wind did what wind does with small bits of foil in a birch. The city moved around its own arteries with unremarkable grace. They had not won. They had continued. They had kept their instruments tuned. They had put their hands to the pumps and to the fans and to their own stubborn hearts and a chapter turned on that motion, as cleanly as a page.Chapter 9\n\nAutumn finally found its footing after so much summer that felt like a dare. The air came thin and edged, a blade for heat\u2019s rope, and the smoke that had made the sky its rented room took down its curtains and apologized by way of distance. Leaves crisped to paper and then to lace and then to brown, and sound began to carry again in that mean way it has when the temperature drops\u2014voices crossing streets they couldn\u2019t manage in July, a door closing from half a block away like a punctuation mark louder than the sentence that required it. Mr. Winn listened to the city\u2019s new clarity as if some orchestra had finally stopped tuning and chosen a key, and she found herself hearing the bus\u2019s brakes with respect, the hiss at the end of the exhale being as honest a piece of music as she had ever asked to memorize.\n\nThe grid had sulked long enough that the council tried something that sounded like thrift and turned out to be ritual. They called it a Turn-Down Night and sent mailers with officious clip art asking neighborhoods to dim for two hours, the hour after sundown and the hour before bed, as if darkness were a chore to assign and not a condition to negotiate. Reaction had the cartoon predictability of any city: a man wrote to the paper to say this was civic theater and he did not audition for roles, a child drew a picture of stars and handed it to a librarian who pinned it to a corkboard with quiet ceremony, and volunteers got to work on the thing they always recognize in an announcement\u2014the invitation buried inside a rule. Arkady posted a tone map on Stoneflower, a chart of small noises the city could lean into: fans set to oscillate instead of point, wind chimes made of spoons and Mylar that clicked like shy teeth, bicycle spokes with ribbons that whispered instead of shouted, radiators finally free to sing their winter song and being asked to sing on purpose.\n\nHe liked the thought of lowered lights as if the city were tipping its head for his hand. He polished the ferrule of a new brush with a rag that had once been a shirt someone loved and told himself the argument he always won when no one answered back: that darkness was a solvent and he, the man who could pour it. He studied a map with a finger that pretended it had gentleness and marked with his nail the places where dark pooled even on busy nights\u2014the reading room at the west branch where lamps hung like planets, the memorial grove where names lived in bronze and the trees shushed any person with a thought of cheer. He hummed to test his own mood and heard in it the old complaint that music had failed him. He didn\u2019t consider sound a thing that counted, because he had never had to listen.\n\nThe practice they made for Turn-Down Night began at the laundromat because everything had come to begin there, the hum of machines a forgiving bassline. A young woman whose degree said audio engineering and whose debts said barista brought little speakers the size of apples and set them on washers, and she played the kind of noise that isn\u2019t a song but still feels like a choice. At low frequency the plexi they\u2019d scrounged from behind an art room wrote small circles of condensation as if it were taking notes. They drew a brave, skinny line of his not-paint on the panel and watched it behave. Under certain tones it held itself like a lie that believes its own face; under others it loosened, feathered at the edges the way frost begins to admit it is only water pretending to be geometry. They learned that the hum of the building itself\u2014the elevator\u2019s muscle, the vents\u2019 dry exhale, the old refrigerator\u2019s honesty\u2014made a modest current in air that the black disliked, not dramatical enough to post about but perfect for the stubbornness of living with a problem.\n\nTurn-Down Night came dressed as festivity and stubborn practicality both. Streetlights bowed to half and porches went to lanterns and then to loud scolding by aunties who refused to let children be delighted by fire unsupervised. The bus\u2019s interior lights dimmed to a polite amount and every driver in the city seemed to discover at the same moment that you could lower the bus knee with your foot and let that hiss be a metronome. In doorways hung bead curtains cut from old Mylar blankets that remembered marathons and here did a different kind of endurance. Fans in windows moved air like river wrists. The Hush Walk went out not with foil shining gaudy but with wind-bells made of keys that clicked a domestic holiness across the hands. They added breath to the list of tasks: breathe when the smear appears and breathe together, because exhale without chorus loses half its moral force.\n\nHe tried the memorial grove first because he liked to begin by stealing gravity. The names on the bronze had learned already to resist him; they had been washed so often now with the kind of care that looks like mourning that the black sulked at their edges and slid off in well-trained beads. He pressed the brush to the bench where a woman was peeling an orange for her father, the peel coming away in one elegant helix that suggested competence to the point of art. She did not flinch, not because she was brave but because she heard the key-bells in the path stir, the kind of sound you cannot quite locate, and she felt the smallest wind volunteer its disobedience along her forearm. The black reached without reaching and then stuttered the way a bad idea does when it encounters habit. His hum went to find itself and discovered with an emotion very close to insult that it had competition. From the path a group of teenagers carried their phones in their back pockets instead of their hands and let out a tone under their breath like lawnmowers over a hill, a brown noise that had gotten famous among insomniacs and now was a civic instrument, and on the plexi panel of the bus shelter the smear that had begun to arrange itself found it had no place to gather.\n\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 arrived not with what the papers would call a weapon but with a joystick that controlled the oscillation of a fan he could not have explained to a judge without learning to love metaphor. He let the blade swing, not angrily but insistently, and the air wrote a discipline over the bench and the bronze that the brush could not count on. The church down the block had loaned a pipe from its organ to a child with good lungs and worse homework, and the sound they made when he blew was not reverent but was old, which suited the problem at hand. The black that had loved flat surfaces and single notes found itself being convinced into forgetting. He reached for a mirror mounted on a pole and drew, and the line he dragged behind his bristles tremored, lost track, and slipped as if embarrassed. He did not understand the holds of phase and anti-phase and it did not matter; his shadow learned to dislike being asked to keep time with anything but itself.\n\nMr. Winn walked with the crowd and let the noise wash the old stubbornness in her chest in a way that annoyed her by feeling too much like cure. Teddy made a small poor choice near the lamppost by the drugstore and then apologized, and she kept the breath pattern Lenka had taught her like a chant, two frogs on a summer ditch swapping places. Her granddaughter had one of the apple speakers clipped to her belt and had named the tone she preferred tonic because naming any tool dignifies the hand that wields it. She pressed a button with a thumb whose nail still had a smear of basil dirt at the quick and the sound that came hummed in the key of unremarkable buildings, a comfort noise. When the smear essayed itself onto the transit map like a thesis with too many adverbs, the girl stepped close, told the people near her not to mind, and let the pocket\u2019s noise lie flat against the glass. The black went soft at the middle and then dissolved without drama. The girl lifted her chin and did not look for applause because she had learned from the women who were teaching that competence is dull to any eye not involved.\n\nHe took himself where no rituals had been practiced\u2014he believed\u2014into the new spa with a sign in a too-gentle font that offered sensory deprivation, which seemed to him, in a mood that surprised him by its honesty, like a place that might finally honor him without require an audience. The pods were eggs someone had forgotten to fill with stories, white on white on low whisper. He put his hand on the curve of one, the brush hovering, and his dark went ahead like an earnest scout. Water waited inside, not running, stilled into obedience by salt, and he had the sudden animal memory of the river refusing to admit him. The filter\u2019s small motor made the tiniest of circulations, a current only a tadpole would brag about, and it was enough. The smear he had sent under the lid met that minuscule motion and failed to sit. It made the pod look unwashed but not unholy, and a woman with tired bones who had paid for an hour of quiet came in and saw the mark and went for a cloth with that tiredness born of a thousand small tidies, and she rubbed, humming because she had been taught in kindergarten to sing when you clean. He left angry at the shape of his own want.\n\nLenka wrote on Mr. Winn\u2019s table with letters that would have earned a C for legibility and an A for content if Mr. Winn were still the kind of person who graded papers. Sound is a river if you ask it to be, she typed around the weak ribbon, and she drew in pencil three little waves like a girl making a map for a game. At the bottom she added, in the shame-hand she affected for her big thoughts, he hums in straight lines because he cannot help himself; give him a curve and he will lose his balance. Arkady took the thought and respun it into a guide for buildings, a habit list: let the vents oscillate, not fixed; run the fans with a sway; schedule the compressors for off-beats if the budget allows; ask janitors to stop halfway down a hall and then go back the other way for no reason they need explain to anyone. The note to the janitors went up on corkboards in break rooms like a promise no one wanted to admit they needed.\n\nOn buses, the kneeling hiss became a kind of call and response, drivers trading jokes about timing while their feet learned a choreography that let machines and people practice being gentle together. Museums leaned their humidity higher for paper and the added air moved grievances off glass in the manner of a polite usher. The nail salon put a playlist on that was mostly fans in different rooms and the women in the chairs laughed with a relief that should not have felt radical. The roller rink DJ discovered a track that was nothing but a subway car recorded from the end of the last car, a steady new river, and whenever she played it the black on the corners of mirrors sighed and forgot its shape. This did not make a headline and no one\u2019s grant proposal got easier to write, but the city\u2019s shoulders went down another inch and stayed there, a measure you could see only if you loved measurement for reasons that were not power.\n\nNoise complaints filed in the week after the Turn-Down rose and fell like the stock market and the men who tally such things tried to find in the data a righteousness they could wear to a meeting. A baby down the hall from Indira discovered that crying into the foil curtain by the elevator made a sound that brought adults at speed, and the household kept the curtain there for a day longer than they needed to because you do not argue with a toddler whose experiment has worked. In the library the new maintenance man put the fans on too high and papers tried to animate themselves off tables, and in the fine for blowing on books column of crime and punishment, he earned a warning and then a pie someone had baked because the building had more gratitude than rules. They tuned and detuned and tuned again, less a policy than a musician\u2019s grunt work.\n\nIn the marbled notebook, Mr. Winn wrote phase and then, because she could not help herself, drew a little sketch of two waves that met and made a straight line where a mess might have been, and she felt a smugness she would not confess to traffic reporters or to saints. She wrote: we starved him of stillness, which had the virtue of being truth and the limitation of being only partial. Under it she wrote: other hungers will find him. He will try to stand where nothing moves\u2014fever, snow, words. She wrote: words move if you make them, and she looked at the page until the line turned into a field and then into a feathering she wanted to call frost and did not, because metaphor had been overworked this year and deserved a nap.\n\nHe went out past the last bus to the place where the forest pretended it had not heard of cities and put his hand on the bark of a pine he would never bother to name. The wind there said ocean without water, a language made of small noises en masse, and he felt his dark slip as if embarrassed to be the only thing holding still. Needles shivered and the sky between gave him a litter of pieces he could not assemble into a wall. He walked a path the color of argument and the sound of his own foot on duff made a music he had always despised, and he did nothing, which was new as a skill. He came back smaller not because anyone took anything from him but because scale is a function of frame and the frame had shifted in ways he did not know how to narrate to himself without breaking.\n\nBulbs went into rooftop tubs with the solemnity of translating something ancient. They planted tulips and then decided on daffodils because daffodils forgive more. Indira and Mr. Winn dug with spoons because the trowel had gone on walkabout and returned as a superhero cape for a doll downstairs and they refused to fight that rescue mission with an adult\u2019s need to own. They tucked the papery bulbs into that mix of dirt and old coffee that every city gardener eventually perfects, and they talked about the way sound had felt as a tool the night before, not as victory but as rehearsal. They watered with brown water that had washed hands and then forgotten that it had, and to the little bump of earth where a tulip slept they told the story of a bus kneeling as a kind of lullaby.\n\nAt the pool the audio engineer and Arkady and four kids who had spent their childhoods making phones serve as drums set up a speaker low enough to be mistaken for negligence and curled the sound around the water like a ribbon and watched the surface write commas. They drew a line on plexi again, because tests require repetition to admit to themselves that they are not lucky, and let a tone that tasted like rain in a parking garage ask the black to un-tell its own story. It did, grudgingly. One of the kids asked whether laughter counted as noise and the audio engineer told him yes and the pool echoed yes yes until they had to fetch the whistle because joy, too, needs shepherding when it\u2019s near water.\n\nHe made himself speak again, poorly. He had never been a man who kept diaries because diaries do not clap, and the phone in his hand became a confession booth without priest. He said into the lens, \u201cYou make a trick out of motion,\u201d and the phone did not argue and did not agree and did not go out of its way to find him an audience. The algorithm did not love him like he believed it should. The comments he read later were tired and practical, women trading fan settings and telling each other which sound machines broke after two months and which ones lasted, and he felt, for the first time perhaps in a life that had had plenty of opportunity for the feeling, truly irrelevant. He mistook that poverty for injustice.\n\nWhen the pumps in the three oldest buildings decided to take the same day off\u2014perhaps in a solidarity learned in pipes that shook toward each other through soil\u2014Mr. Winn and Indira and a boy who had found the trowel ribbon in the pocket of his hoodie moved water without believing it made them saints. C\u00f4t\u00e9 drove a boxy city van badly up a narrow lane because permission did not come with skill, and he and two other men who had expected their hands to write tickets and not carry cases of bottles invented a relay that did not require applause. At the end of the corridor that smelled of institutions and dinners, someone had drawn a line two nights ago and a woman who carried a baby the fussy size of a loaf of bread took a patience she could not afford and poured a streak of her ration along it as if drawing a line between mischief and home. It lifted, shame-faced. She went on.\n\nHe tried snow when it came, because snow is a pause with edges, and he liked edges. He pressed the brush to the plexi of a bus shelter grown brittle with cold. The line he drew tried to be himself and then fell onto the snow on the sill and made a dull collusion with white that read as stain and not as doctrine. A volunteer in a hat long enough to be described, in older novels, as knitted with love, breathed, and the breath fogged and then fell as tiny rivulets of perfectly ordinary wet. The smear unmade itself with a laziness that felt like cruelty. He laughed in a way that broke something inside whatever the black used for pride.\n\nAt the council chamber with its flags that had never learned to drape with grace, they argued about noise in a way that would have made summer Mr. Winn impatient and now only tickled her in the way of small absurdities. The first-to-know councilor floated the idea of appointing a Director of Sound and was surprised when the room did not mock her. The Public Works woman said, \u201cWe already have one; it is the wind,\u201d and then, because she had learned to dress the truth in a blazer, added, \u201cand also my department, on Thursdays,\u201d and they laughed with their shoulders and then wrote a line into a document that would outlast any of them and it said more or less: buildings will be invited to move air. It was an invitation like many the city had grown good at writing\u2014it sounded soft until you felt the hand behind it.\n\nMr. Winn went home and made tea and forgot the kettle on and remembered it in time and wrote in the marbled book the sentences she allowed herself when the city had pleased her and, in pleasing, made her suspicious. She wrote: do not love your tools so much you forget to put them down. She wrote: when he stops moving, do not write a ballad. She wrote: practice is the only magic we are allowed. Teddy made a little jump in agreement or disapproval; it was hard to tell. The basil on the sill gave up at last, its leaves despairing of pretending to be green, and she cut what could be cut and dried it on a plate she had saved from the old country\u2019s thrift store because being poor at the right time is how you end a day.\n\nHe stood at the window of his room in a building that had pretended to be fashionable and failed and watched a bus lower for an empty stop and he did not sneer. He did not admire, either; he was not ready for that. Down the block a woman shook out a cloth and the cloth made a wave of air the size of her kitchen and the black in the corner of the window frame retreated without narrative. He felt anger in his knees the way men do when they are slowly being asked to learn they are not the protagonist, and he put his brush in a jar and for a second made the mistake of thinking that a gesture is a choice. The jar was clean. The brush stayed a brush. The city moved around him with a competence that did not ask permission. The Turn-Down ended without anyone besides the council and a few poets noting it, and the lights went back up to their small arrogant levels, and the fans kept moving because motion, once it is learned, is reluctant to forget itself.Chapter 10\n\nWinter tried on sincerity and then committed, and the city adjusted its jaw the way you do when a new filling reminds you there is a mouth inside the face you present. The river put on a sheet in places where it was shallow, a brittle pretense, and kept its muscle where depth made stubbornness academic. The air sharpened into the kind of attention that never suits liars, and sounds travelled as if hired for the job\u2014skate blades farther along the path than you could account for, the far-off drill that Public Works wielded against a bolt which had decided it was married. Mr. Winn learned the creaks in her building again, winter\u2019s specific chorus, and found that the radiator\u2019s song had a kindness in it she had failed to recognize as a child. It was not music, not really; it was function so steadfast that it bothered to be audible.\n\nStoneflower wrote in threads not of panic but of phase, a handful of physicists with kindness in their fonts explaining how water, obedient mostly to heat, could be coaxed into disobedience by motion even when the calendar tried to fix it. A woman from the parks department with calves like the roots of a tree posted photographs of bubblers the city had forgotten it owned, little machines meant for ornamental ponds now reinterpreted as river breath. Volunteers borrowed the word aeration and made it a civic endearment. They asked the fountain that had spat half-hearted rainbows in the plaza all summer to use its lungs to keep the underpass from glazing into something his not-paint would love. A man with a plow route longer than some family trees found himself consenting to drag a chain behind the truck just to scratch the ice into a thousand lines, which is another way of saying he had been taught to make surface unconfident.\n\nHe went for ice with the stubborn curiosity of someone who has had a favorite table taken away and must discover whether the new one will hold his elbows. At the river\u2019s edge where the water had decided to pretend it was floor, he pressed the brush and watched the black scud across slickness and try to be a face. The cold did not respect his appetite. It seized the skin of the stain at the edges and made it look like a bruise pretending to be architecture. A child in a too-big parka with pompoms like modest planets skated close, mother at a distance, and her blades made their own sound like careful tearing, and the black tremored wherever she passed as if the idea of glide had embarrassed it. He tried to write longer and the city\u2019s small interventions, salt and grit and chain scratches and a bubbler twenty feet downstream pushing its insistence through the field, turned his line into confetti that could not decide whether it wanted to be ink or ash.\n\nIn Mr. Winn\u2019s kitchen, Teddy chose to send stern notes at inconvenient hours and had to be answered with breath and patience and Indira\u2019s hands with their small, competent heat. The granddaughter learned the inventory of pills and the inventory of jokes that worked no matter how scared a room became, and she practiced not overperforming either. They set up new rituals alongside the old ones: a check of the misters\u2019 hoses coiled for spring, a glance at the fan in the hallway to ensure oscillation did not die under the weight of laziness, a tally kept in the marbled book of days when she could make it to the bus stop and pour a thin line and days when the window must be her observation deck. She told herself boredom was still a weapon and that it had to be shared to be sharp.\n\nThe reading room at West Branch put out an advisory in the plainest tone it had: please do not breathe on the vellum. They turned the pages anyway, librarians with the good hands, and found they had built a weather that defended memory. He entered with his hum down low and the dark sitting like a folded coat around him and aimed at a display case so proud of its carefulness it had grown humble. The case, as it turned out, was an instrument too; its microclimate put a slow circulation on the air that lifted a smear\u2019s edges and weathered it into an accident. Librarians became ornithologists of smudge and learned to identify the species at a glance. They set the humidifiers not at stasis but at a practiced sway and forced his certainty to try to find purchase on a surface writing its own small poem of ebb and return. A page turned across the room made a draft that was not drama but was doctrine, and the black retreated, offended without admitting to offense because it preferred to think of its sensitivities as power.\n\nThe city rediscovered readings as if someone had thrown a cue. Not the sponsored kind with wine in plastic cups and jackets that needed tending; the stubborn kind in laundromats and bus depots and clinic vestibules, where grandparents took turns making words into weather for children who had forgotten their scarves. They learned to read out loud not because it made anyone clever but because it moved the air where breath sometimes failed to collect. Lines of poetry, yes, when somebody wanted to be tender, but grocery lists too, a woman reciting in bored reverence the inventory she had to face and letting that cadence set up a current in the hallway. Students stood in a circle under bead curtains and chanted multiplication tables as if they were invoking something older than numbers, and the smear on the wall behind them relented despondently in the face of rhythm. A man with a bad day read his appliance manual for a toaster over the heads of strangers waiting for a bus and the laugh that went through the shelter did exactly what was required.\n\nAt the dam the bubbler team learned to ask for overtime without apology and Public Works discovered it could borrow parts from places the budget had not thought to categorize as cousins. The men who had names stitched in blue on their shirts became heroes by refusing the word and showing up with tools that clicked and whined and turned deep water from a mirror into an argument. A heron watched from a sill of ice with the professional resignation of a bird that knows it has outlived fashions. He came to the wall and counted bolts like prayers he never liked and told himself a story about leverage that admitted no mathematicians. He pressed the brush to the railing as if to sign it and discovered that the salt that kept human feet honest had left a wet that would not keep secrets, and the line he drew forgot itself on contact with the film only City Hall would ever learn the procurement number for. He withdrew with dignity and that, perhaps, was the beginning of a new humiliation for him; he could not even give himself to fury with any hope of applause to make it worth the cost.\n\nLenka made soup and called it conveyance because nothing else that day had gone where it should. She carried the pot across a hallway to Mr. Winn\u2019s door, dish towel wrapped in that particular grandma architecture that prevents burns but looks like ritual. They ate and let steam be a tool, lids lifted and replaced until the windows remembered what winter does to glass, and afterward she typed poorly about betrayals she had seen in other towns where men of a similar appetite had tried to turn stillness into territory. In the margin she penciled a note because the ribbon had finally cracked itself into silence: steam carries; enlist it when you can. The laundromat took the sentence literally and put a kettle behind the coin machine to warm the room\u2019s air in enough cycles that fog became ordinance.\n\nHe tried the subway, in the hour when trains ran like promises kept grudgingly, and put his hand out into the piston wind that tunnels generate for free. He had always held contempt for the kind of movement that does not originate in a human hand and here found himself, to his surprise, resentful of steel. The smear he sent ahead of himself made it three feet before the gust ran its fingers through it and unmade it into suggestion. Students, noses pink with cold above their masks, did not offer him a glance. A busker at the turnstile played the same three bars on a violin with a determination that would have made saints rueful, and the ruins of his line on a tile wall adopted the rhythm against their will until they were more accompaniment than inscription.\n\nScreens, which he had scorned because they belong to a species of attention that refuses to be shared with anything but itself, betrayed him with updates. The e-ink timetables in the transit shelters refreshed in that little shiver you have to look for deliberately, and his not-paint could not keep its grip on a surface that insisted on the small polite chaos of changing digits. He tried his line down the edge where the advertisement had been put under glass no thicker than a fingernail, and the hydrophilic film lifted water from air to meet him with a thin slick handshake that left him feeling like a man who has been given a pamphlet when he had demanded a sword. His hum rose in irritation and was met by a child practicing a recorder wrong on purpose, and for the first time he considered taking offense at a note.\n\nTurn-Down became Turn-Over became habit. They made schedules for the oscillations of air instead of for the delivery of spectacle, and the flyers that went out to building supers had diagrams that looked like dances drawn by a careful hand that did not like to admit to art. The Office of Motion\u2014the joke title the Public Works woman had put on a note as sarcasm and then stamped on a memo as if that had been the plan all along\u2014started to send bulletins written in the voice of an aunt: do not forget to let your fans rest between stretches, darlings, because machines have the tempers of middle children. Mr. Winn saved those notices with the reverence she reserved for recipes written in other women\u2019s hands and taped them inside a cupboard door she opened twice a day because ritual improves if it is near flour.\n\nThere were setbacks of the small, true sort, the kind a novelist would remove for cleanliness and a city must keep to avoid myth. A volunteer slipped on the thin film that comes when ambition meets a cheap mop and sprained an already tired ankle. A bubbler seized and coughed oil like a gossip and had to be taken apart on a night cold enough to make men swear in languages they didn\u2019t know they knew. A man whose temperament tended toward argument took a fan\u2019s oscillation as an insult and calmed down only when the custodian let him put a hand on the grille to feel the reality of appliance instead of the suspicion of plan. A teen with a bright appetite for drama filmed himself trying to make the black hold on a frosted window and got three likes and a text from a girl who told him he was being predictable and he went to the rink instead. The obituary column in the paper\u2014the column no one wants and everyone requires\u2014made a small lean toward the ordinary that winter, and the city let itself be grateful without sending a self-congratulatory note to itself.\n\nOn the roof the basil had given up and the bulbs slept in their paper coats, and the two women who had planted them tried not to look like people at a bedside. They shook dry seed into envelopes and dated them as if spring could be called to attention by a stamp. Mr. Winn told the story of her father\u2019s hands again, because repetition is one of age\u2019s rewards, and the granddaughter asked for it in the way of teenagers who pretend that they are submitting more than requesting. She made tea and got the water just short of boiling because herbs are snobs, and when they drank it it tasted like the shadow of a summer in a city that had had to relearn every choreography it thought had gone out of fashion.\n\nHe went back to the river not because he had any hope of conquering it but because misery, like worship, is repetitive. He walked to the place where the ice showed off in a lilac that would have delighted him if he had had room in his attention for any color but his own, and he put the brush in the pocket of his coat and did not take it out. The fog lifted in a single line from a breathe-hole where the bubbler worked and he stepped into it by accident, a joke written by physics and not by anyone\u2019s agenda. His coat gathered damp and his shadow, which had always believed itself exempt, recoiled with the skittishness of a horse surprised by its own reflection. He stood a long time and the only witness was a woman he did not see who had come with a thermos to practice her own ritual, and she poured a thin line along the lip of the path and did not look at him because withholding that last dignity had become a civic sport.\n\nThe council posed for a photograph none of them would print, a group of people with their faces in honest winter disarray standing in front of a box of fans and a spool of Mylar and a crate of replacement humidifier filters that held the true glamour of any season. They passed a resolution no one would call a law because the word law makes people stand up straighter than necessary: buildings, public and private, are requested to move air. The city clerk wrote it into language that would not be laughed at by anyone who counts commas, and the maintenance crews nodded because it meant someone had noticed their empire. The marketing firm tried to design a poster declaring Sound Saves and Arkady wrote a note that said, as gently as she knew how, please stop giving us slogans; we have enough to hold in our mouths.\n\nMr. Winn found herself saving ridiculous things that winter\u2014rubber bands with their bloom of starch, the twist tie from bread, the label peeled off a jar because the glue was obedient and it felt like disloyalty to throw away any honest labor. Her heart behaved itself more often than she had any right to expect, and when it did not, the drills of breath and quiet and practiced boredom did what drills do: they made a skill out of panic\u2019s bad impulse. She wrote in the marbled book sentences she would have dismissed as trite in a classroom and found them to be, in a kitchen, exact. You can be tired and still be useful. You can be afraid and still be courteous. You can be unimportant and still be necessary. Indira found the book open one afternoon and added in her own hand, slanted and decisive, you can be wrong and try again without ceremony.\n\nThe man whose darkness had learned reluctance took a bus one afternoon not because he had chosen humility but because the car he had counted on was sulking under a thin coat of ice that made tires into advice nobody wanted. He sat two rows back and watched the driver work the knee of the machine for an old man carrying celery and for a girl with a backpack that made the alphabet look newly minted, and in the rhythm of the bus he felt something he did not have a name for because the names available to him had been stolen by people he had refused to watch. The hydrophilic film on the glass behind the ad that showed a woman with a hammer and a smile was scratched but useful, and the little bead chain on the stop request bell knocked a rhythm against the pole that made the shadow at his heel jitter into a species of shyness. He got off not because it was his stop but because the bus had made itself into a room that did not need him.\n\nThere was a night colder than the year deserved, and the fans stuttered in their bearings and the bubbler complained like an old man, and the people who had made a habit out of mercy did what habits are for and did not abandon their post. A boy with bad gloves took the midnight shift at the rink because the generator needed to be fed and the fog had to be kept from lying down flat, and he sang to himself without knowing the building could hear him and approve. A woman on the hospital\u2019s third floor who had spent her career mending the small holes left by the city in the bodies of its citizens watched the hydrophilic film carry the smallest of beads along its face and thought, ungodly for a minute, that if there were a god this might be how grace chose to move.\n\nWhen spring\u2019s first rumor came not in bud but in smell\u2014a sour wet at the seams of the sidewalks where snow had hunkered and homesickness had gone to winter\u2014the city had enough practice not to mistake rumor for arrival. The bulbs in the roof tubs did the math on light and decided to be patient, and the basil envelope stayed in the jar as if a seed can tell time by paper. He went looking for a new surface with a man\u2019s temper for having to adapt and found none that would restore him to the scale he had once bullied the city into granting. He stood at a bus shelter and watched a volunteer wipe, not in circles, but in lines taught by the Office of Motion, because circles coddle a smear and lines make it travel, and he felt not hatred but the pettier thing that rots quicker: envy of competence.\n\nOn an evening when the sky had the clean marrow-blue of polite cold and Mr. Winn counted the kneels at the stop without the craving to make the number round off into a legend, a woman in a visor who had scolded him for opening an umbrella in a park months ago came to sit and said nothing and then said, after two stops had gone by, that her boy slept better to brown noise and she had bought a machine that did the job well. Mr. Winn told her she was an engineer whether or not anyone had hired her. The hydrophilic film did its quiet trick one more time on an attempt that would not be broadcast because the city had finally gotten good at starve. The keys in the bead curtain at the laundromat clicked a note that had become a civic pitch. The river, under ice in places and not in others, remembered what water is and refused to be hired by anybody\u2019s story. They sat and let the bus make its kneeling music and counted only for themselves, because a ritual without a congregation is sometimes the clearest kind.",

                              "content": "He came up out of the ravine where the cattails whispered and the river forgot its name. A giant, they called him, because no other word made sense when he unfolded from the shadows like a crane from its operator\u2019s shack. He had a bucket in one hand, a brush in the other. There was no smell of turpentine, just a flat darkness that didn\u2019t glint, didn\u2019t take the moon the way ordinary paint would. He hummed as he walked. On the pavement, he left heel-and-toe prints that looked like punctuation marks. His hum was tuneless, an argument with music. Women waiting at the bus stop by the shuttered bakery pressed closer together, jackets tugged tight. He didn\u2019t rush. He never did. It was the slowness that nettled. He raised the brush, let it drip a black that wasn\u2019t quite liquid, wasn\u2019t quite shadow, and laughed without moving his open mouth. \u201cLook at you,\u201d he said, but not to any one of them, and when he flicked the brush, the air itself seemed to bruise. One of the women stepped forward, chin set, but a second woman caught her sleeve. The bus\u2019s headlights rounded the corner, and in the brightness the giant\u2019s dark looked blacker. He touched the bus shelter glass with two fingers and left a smear that the ad beneath couldn\u2019t quite hold. \u201cSmall lights,\" he murmured. \u201cYou\u2019re all small lights.\u201d He did not touch their skin. He painted their reflections.\n\nMr. Winn watched from a kitchen window three floors up, her mug cooling on the sill, her heart thudding the familiar old thud that now and then skipped and then remembered itself. People in the building still called her Mr. because they always had, because she\u2019d taught them math when they were younger and the habit clung like a chalk-smear. She was Winnifred in her passport, Win to the ones who dared, Mr. to everyone else, and she had stopped correcting them some time around her seventieth birthday when energy became a budget. She was eighty now. Her cane leaned against the microwave, a plaster saint in a family that didn\u2019t believe. From here she could see the river, the bus stop, the narrow lots. She could see the man, if he was a man. She saw the way he inclined his head to listen for the bus\u2019s brakes sighing, for the soft shuffle of sneakers. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to make them small,\u201d she told the glass, and her voice came out dry as a moth\u2019s wing. The news had called him a giant because it kept children in their beds and adults at their desks. Giants were fairy-tale. The truth of him was worse, being not quite fairy, not quite tale.\n\nThe night the first video went viral, her granddaughter had texted at 3:12 a.m., a string of messages that didn\u2019t quite form sentences. Mr. Winn had turned on the radio instead of the TV. She trusted the voices that kept company with storms. They said what they knew and left what they didn\u2019t in the hush between weather and the farm report. A name, Bob. It was the demotic of terror, a nickname for a thunderhead. Bob had come from nowhere and everywhere, a man large enough to bend streetlights into bows, a figure in a too-long coat, a sound like a truck idling. He taunted women, the announcer said, no singsong lilt to the words, just a flat line of information. He painted them black\u2014painted their coats, their hair, their shoes, the sidewalk beneath their feet, not with tar or oil but with a black that seemed to insist on itself. A mark. A shaming. Or something more ritual and more stupid. The line between prank and assault was a line he scuffed until it looked like there was no line at all. The radio voice went soft the way people do when they tell you your lab results aren\u2019t what they hoped. The police had a grainy still. Anonymous tips clogged the hotline. Copycats had already begun, across a city nine hours ahead, across a campus three in the other direction. The math of fear is always exponential. One becomes two becomes eight\u2019s echo.\n\n\u201cMr.,\u201d called Indira from the hall, knocking with the bent knuckle she used when she brought soup. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t stand in drafts.\u201d \u201cThen the drafts shouldn\u2019t stand where I\u2019m standing,\u201d Winn said, but she stepped back anyway, smile tucked in. Indira\u2019s face was lit with phone-light. \u201cHe\u2019s down there,\u201d Indira said, pointing like that would help, like Winn didn\u2019t have eyes of her own. \u201cHe won\u2019t come up,\u201d Winn said. \u201cMonsters like slopes.\u201d \u201cIs he a monster?\u201d Indira asked, and Winn let the question be a saucer she put down on the table without answering. They stood, two women in a kitchen that still smelled faintly of last week\u2019s onions. The refrigerator made the sound of a distant shore. \u201cYou can call someone,\u201d Indira said. \u201cWho would come?\u201d Winn felt the old teacher rise in her throat, the tone she used to call a class back to itself. \u201cThey\u2019ll come. They\u2019re always late, and they always come.\u201d \u201cDo you think he knows we\u2019re watching?\u201d Indira whispered. \u201cHe wants the watching,\u201d said Winn, and was surprised at the certainty in her own mouth.\n\nThe first time a copycat killed someone, it wasn\u2019t on purpose, an anchor said later in a voice tuned to hush hysteria. It never is, the anchor added in tone if not in words, and someone had to go to the hospital for saying what she wasn\u2019t allowed to. A young man in a hoodie had flung paint at a woman jogging at dusk along a seawall. She stumbled into traffic. A truck\u2019s driver didn\u2019t see. The numbers changed. They made the crawl at the bottom of every screen into a thicker rope. This is how it works, Mr. Winn thought, not for the first time. We name it. We feed it. It grows. In a grainy clip from Hamburg you could hear a man laughing: \u201cWe\u2019re painting the night,\u201d and a chorus of hoots, a laughter that sounded like coughs. In Lagos a woman sat on a stoop and wiped at her blackened hands with a dishcloth, her mouth a hard, white line, the camera recipient of her controlled fury. In Seoul a subway car stood with its doors open while maintenance crews swabbed at streaks that had seeped into the plexiglass like bruises remembering fists. The words were different because languages are, but the rhythm was the same. This was not just him anymore. This was a contagion that did not need a carrier now that the idea itself had a skeleton. Deaths rose in the way calculators do when your finger holds down a button too long.\n\nMr. Winn took out a notebook with a marbled cover and a list began without her permission. It was always like that. Lists were a reflex, a scratching itch. She wrote dates, times, locations, details that felt useful because they were small. \u201cHe hums,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNo gasoline smell. No brush marks when he moves away.\u201d She wrote: \u201cHe does not run. He is never earlier than the last bus. He looks up.\u201d She had a friend on the force, or had had, years ago, a young officer who\u2019d taken her class twice because math was a beast he wanted to domesticate. He was a detective now and wore his exhaustion like a well-cut suit. She still had his card, the printed number as irrelevant as a street address to a person who preferred bridges. She dialed him anyway. \u201cC\u00f4t\u00e9,\u201d he said, his voice the same as always, a tree trunk. \u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d she said, and waited for him to catch up. He did. \u201cMr. Winn,\u201d he said, warmth tucked under the formalities. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to give you,\u201d he began, and she cut him off. \u201cI\u2019m not asking for secrets,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m asking for your patience.\u201d \u201cThat I have,\u201d he said, and she could hear him set something down on a desk, the wafer of a coffee cup finding a ring. \u201cHe\u2019s out there,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s everywhere,\u201d C\u00f4t\u00e9 answered. \u201cTell your people to stay inside,\u201d she told him, and then laughed because who were her people anymore? \u201cWe\u2019ll increase patrols,\u201d he said instead of the truth, and in the pause they both thought the same thought: late, late, late.\n\nIf the giant had a name before the feeds named him Bob, if he had a mother who held his wrist as they crossed the street and told him not to touch the wet paint on the porch railing, if he had a neighbor who took in his mail when he went away once, none of it mattered now. Now he was a rumor that wore boots. He thought in alternating currents. He walked with a patience learned from watching a river wreck its banks. He did not dream. Or if he did, the dreams were what the world called waking. His hatred was not personal; he would have told you that if you had asked him and stayed long enough to endure the answer. \u201cIt\u2019s pattern,\u201d he would have said, \u201cit\u2019s the smallness of your lights,\u201d but what he meant was thrumming in his wrists, a music like a headache. Women turned the world. Women insisted on being suns. It offended him and that offense was his oxygen. He found a joy in making a gloss of the faces that would not shine for him, as though he could put night back where day had dared to nest. He had no slogans. He found them in the mouths of others, in the comments section that floated him like a sea supports a corpse. He didn\u2019t need to be smart. He needed to be seen. He was very, very good at being seen.\n\nFor a time, after her husband died, Mr. Winn had logged in to rooms filled with strangers who remembered things. She found homes in the places where the records of old roads lived, in the corners of the internet where aerial photographs of towns in 1953 meant something to someone besides a city planner. She had a handle, m.r.w., and a reputation for accuracy. It turned out that the people who hunted lost deeds and collected abandoned maps were the same people who saw patterns before the police framed them. They had threads. They had spreadsheets that looked like quilts. \u201cIt\u2019s a copycat cascade,\u201d someone wrote. \u201cNormalcy bias is broken, so they\u2019ll try anything that looks like story,\u201d wrote another, and Mr. Winn loved her for saying so. A person with a name that wasn\u2019t quite a name\u2014arkady\u2014sent her a file. She had to pick it up like the old days, with more caution than necessary. It was a clip of a garage where someone had recorded a shadow as it went by. Not much. Lucid noise. But in the audio, under the thrum of a refrigerator, you could hear a low voice say, \u201cPaint is confession.\u201d She played it again and again until the phrase lost meaning and turned to rhythm. Paint is confession. Confession to whom? The last time she had confessed anything it had been to her daughter on a bench by the river: I cannot be the woman you need me to be. She had meant patience. She had meant stamina. She had meant: I am old. Her daughter had nodded and held her hand as though Mr. Winn were the child and not the other way around. It had been a good day.\n\nWhen the night market came back to Kitchener after its winter break, the organizers posted signs promising extra security and foolishness at a minimum. The night smelled like sugar and charcoal. Mr. Winn went because she refused not to. She moved through the crowd like a ship through reeds, the cane making a percussive rhythm that kept her honest. Wachowski\u2019s dumpling cart had a line like a pilgrim trail. A girl at a stall called CandleLit sold jars the size of fists with wicks braided like sailors\u2019 knots. At the entrance, a police van idled, officers standing in pairs with the stiffness of people who want to be anywhere else. Mr. Winn found a bench made of three planks and a history of splinters. She let the crowd move around her. She had learned to be still. Around her, phones pointed at food and faces. The paint was obvious when it came because it did not catch the light. The giant did. He moved at the edge first, the way a storm tries out its voice before it takes to the center. A woman laughed too loudly at something in the next stall and the laughter cracked. He didn\u2019t go for her. He reached for the canvas of a mural someone had commissioned for the event, a wash of bright oranges and blues, a woman\u2019s face composed of flowers, a celebration, and with one calm swipe he salted it with night. The crowd hissed like a continent of kettles. He turned and the black he\u2019d made seemed to expand, a wet blot on the eye.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a right to that,\u201d Mr. Winn said, not sure whether she was talking to the art or the air around it. He heard her. Of course he heard her. He found her with an ease she found obscene, a snap of attention like a lighthouse beam falling square on a window that thought itself a secret. He smiled. He wasn\u2019t young, but he wasn\u2019t old. His face was the kind you forgot immediately while remembering forever the idea of it. He tipped his head at her, as if she\u2019d told a joke that he liked. \u201cYou like rules,\u201d he said. \u201cI like boundaries,\u201d she said. \u201cThey keep the wrong people out.\u201d He raised the brush. He didn\u2019t bring it close. He tapped it against his shoulder in a bored little rhythm. The black did not splatter. This was the thing that broke her heart more than anything: the black obeyed him. \u201cYou think names will help you,\u201d he said. \u201cThey always have,\u201d she said. He waited as if for a better answer and when none came, he turned away and trailed his brush along the ground in a line that the children would step over tomorrow as though it were the border between lands on a map.\n\nAfterwards, in the wash of siren colors and the sizzle of indignation, people gave her credit she hadn\u2019t earned. \u201cYou stood up to him,\u201d said a young woman with a shaved head and a tattoo of a sparrow on her wrist. \u201cI\u2019m very tired,\u201d said Mr. Winn, and meant it. C\u00f4t\u00e9 found her near the exit, his tie loosened, his face a cantilever of worry. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have engaged,\u201d he told her, the way a teacher tells a kid to keep hands flat on the desk. \u201cHe listens,\u201d she said. \u201cHe listens to hear where the fear is,\u201d C\u00f4t\u00e9 answered. \u201cThen we\u2019ll whisper,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t make jokes,\u201d he told her and then seemed to hear himself and smiled despite where they were. \u201cWe can\u2019t get ahead of him,\u201d he said, low. \u201cWe\u2019re always reading his footprints.\u201d \u201cBecause you keep pretending he\u2019s singular,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s not one. He\u2019s many, and he\u2019s a story.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t arrest a story,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can if it has a body,\u201d she said, and the look he gave her was something like belief and something like grief. He wrote his new number on the back of her hand like anyone\u2019s teenage friend and told her to call only if it mattered. \u201cIt always matters,\u201d she said, and he ran a hand over his hair and didn\u2019t answer.\n\nThe market closed a half hour early without calling it that. Everywhere, the faces of women had a new tightness to the mouth, a new swivel to the head on the neck. If you\u2019d been dropped into that crowd from space you would have said: there are hawks above. News came in even before she got home. A hospital in Newark on lockdown. In Jaipur someone with a bucket and a bandanna had been chased across a roof and had fallen wrong. A vigil in Prague, candles under a statue that wore a shawl of soot. The counts became their own tally marks. The lines on the graphs found a steeper angle as though something had leaned its weight against them. Someone on Stoneflower posted a screenshot of the growth curve with the caption, \u201cThis is not natural\u201d and Arkady answered, \u201cNothing viral needs to be natural once it\u2019s taken root in minds.\u201d Mr. Winn clicked and clicked until the numbers blurred and what remained was the thudding truth: this would get worse before worse became a measure too small to hold it.\n\nIn the morning, a thin envelope slid under her door. It had a stamp from a town she knew from the taste of its name. Bloom. A postmark like a scar. She sat. She was, if she was honest, a person who believed in omens if they came in the shape of the mail. The note inside had been typed on a machine that refused to give itself to the century. The letters had inconsistent ink, as though some of them had been loved more than others. Win, it read, which put a crack in her heart. Only three people wrote her that, and two of them were dead. The third was Lenka, who had left years ago for a prairie sky and never looked back. The note was four sentences. His paint isn\u2019t paint. It\u2019s the dark of a thing that eats light. Shadows can\u2019t swim. Find where the river is deeper than he thinks. Then, in a smaller script, as though shameful: It will like me less for telling you. She pressed the paper to her mouth as if she could taste the place it had been written. Shadows can\u2019t swim. Ridiculous. Useful. Most truths that mattered started as a thing you could only say slant.\n\nShe spent the day walking the city with the map of it superimposed on her brain like the overlay of a blue diagram. The river bent and split and gathered itself again. Bridges had personalities; some invited, some dared. At the iron footbridge by the old mill, graffiti had been layered so many times you could feel the strata with your fingertips, noble sediment of bored summers. She paused midspan and looked down into water that did not carry a perfect reflection but a rubbed-out version. Her cane leaned against the railing while her free hand held a thermos that had once belonged to her husband, a dent near the cap where the world had tried to whack it into another shape. \u201cHe wants a stage,\u201d she told the wind. \u201cHe wants a chorus and he wants it to sing his tune.\u201d She thought about the last bus stop before the bend, about the way the streetlights failed to reach the riverbank because budget was always what you thought you could hide beneath a word like prudence. It would have to be soon. The city could not keep holding its breath.\n\nThat night she didn\u2019t sleep so much as catalog horizontal hours. She had a dream about a classroom with no desks, the students standing, faces upturned like sunflowers, only their centers were black and the petals dull. She woke with a sentence in her mouth: To solve a problem, you have to believe a solution exists. It wasn\u2019t hers. It belonged to the textbooks she had flung away in disgust years ago. But a bad sentence can hold a good crumb, and she combed it. Believe a solution exists. Not a cure. Not a hero. A way. She found her boots. She found the key to the basement where the building\u2019s old laundry sink held water cool as forgiveness. She filled two bottles and swung them into a bag. She put on the coat that didn\u2019t mind rain. She wrote a note to Indira in case, because this is what you do when you leave the possibility of not returning. Hello I am taking a foolish walk. If I do not return, do not let them say I went quietly. She stuck it to the fridge magnet shaped like a pear.\n\nThe streets at midnight were a quieter kind of busy. A cat preluded her down the block and then ducked into a hedge as though embarrassed by its own company. A man in a parka walked a dog whose leash had LEDs that looked like a child\u2019s bracelet. The river spoke in its many voices. Ahead, the bus stop kept its vigil. There was no bus scheduled now, but buses have their own rules about crisis, and she\u2019d seen them roll up empty just to change the air. He would come. He had learned the schedule of their forgetting. Her cane struck sparks from the sidewalk in her mind, though it did no such thing in actual. She chose the far side of the shelter and stood where the bank sloped toward the water\u2019s shoulder. She was not, she scolded herself, a brave woman. She was simply the one who had gone. That will have to do, she told the imaginary teacher who lived in her sternum. Across the river, a light went on in a house and then off again, the occupant making a decision that was none of her business.\n\nShe heard him before she saw him. Not footsteps. A shift in the night\u2019s voltage. The kind of quiet that isn\u2019t empty but taut. The black came with him. It was as if he had a shadow that had recruited other shadows and all of them waited for his signal to advance. He was tall as a story told by a liar. He stopped beside the shelter and considered the ad for a thrill show in some city that wore its noise like a crown. He set down his bucket. The black did not slosh. \u201cYou again,\u201d he said without turning. \u201cMe,\u201d she said, and the sound was so inadequate she added, \u201cI taught math,\u201d as if competence could be an armor anyone would honor. He faced her then, and the brush lifted on its own as though a man had attached to it merely for show. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to write the world,\u201d he told her, and she didn\u2019t answer because it seemed foolish to disagree about something like that. \u201cYou get to scribble,\u201d he allowed. \u201cYou get to flick your little lights at each other and call it love.\u201d \u201cYou came from somewhere,\u201d she said, and surprised herself with the tear that rose and did not fall. He looked past her as if he had a more interesting student than this one. \u201cEverything comes from somewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what.\u201d He took a step toward her.\n\n\u201cShadows can\u2019t swim,\u201d she said, softly, like a prayer you don\u2019t admit to. He stopped. It was not the words; it was the posture of words. \u201cSomeone told you a joke,\u201d he said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a bad one.\u201d \u201cIt isn\u2019t a joke,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if it is, I\u2019ve chosen to laugh at you and not with you.\u201d \u201cDo you think you can insult a tide?\u201d he asked, and there was something close to admiration in it. \u201cI know tides fail,\u201d she said. \u201cThey fail to drown us every time.\u201d He took another step. The slope behind her waited, a darker dark. Her hands were steady. She thought of the letters in Lenka\u2019s note, some of them bold with habit. She thought of the little girl at the market with the sparrow tattoo who had said you stood up to him and had meant I wish I were you and had been wrong. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d she told him, lying. \u201cI do,\u201d he said, and for the first time there was something in his voice like honesty. \u201cI truly do.\u201d The brush lifted, something in the air tense as the skin of milk in a warmed pot.\n\nShe stepped back. The bank was steeper than it looked, the grasses slick with the day\u2019s leftover damp. The river took her ankle and then her knee. Cold wrote itself around her bones. She did not yell. He leaned forward, amused, but did not offer a hand. The dark around him thickened as if it took a breath. \u201cCareful,\u201d he said, mock concern a chord he could play well. She took another step back because she had committed to this, because retreat had become a kind of advance. The night rearranged itself in that moment into a diagram she could read. She felt the water pulling and the mud letting go. She smelled the city and the river and the paint that was not paint. The brush he held trembled, just slightly, as though it too had a pulse. He lifted it and extended it toward her, curious suddenly to see if the river would take the color the way walls did, if water could be made to admit his mark. He reached. She reached. His shadow tilled itself forward as a field does when a wind scythes it. And then\u2014",

It was a mirror smeared by thumbprints and a beast with a cold tongue and a ledger that remembered what fell into it. The tip of his brush hovered like a surgeon\u2019s scalpel and when the black that was not paint reached for the water, the water reached back in a way that was not reach at all but refusal. The smear he teased toward her slid off the bristles as if embarrassed to be seen and went to lie on the surface with the smugness of oil until the current tugged and the thing that ate light discovered that the feast was not for it. It puckered. It shivered like skin under a voltage. It tried, with the insistence of a stubborn child, to remain itself and could not. What had always obeyed him made a sound that was not a sound but a feeling in her teeth and the smear tore, not into droplets but into absences that collapsed under their own lack and fell through.\n\nHe flinched for the first time since she\u2019d seen him, a minute pull at the corner of his mouth as if a fish had tugged a hook buried there. His shadow did a strange mathematics, thinning away from the river\u2019s edge as if the slope were a proof it had failed. He shifted his weight, surprised, and the bucket cocked against his shin. She did what she had carried water through ninety minutes of doubt to do. She dragged the bag up from the wet against her hip, worked the cap with fingers that had taught endless children to turn stubborn screw-tops, and flung a bright rope of water across the low air between them. It arced, so small a gesture against so much night, and struck the bristles first. The brush convulsed like a living thing. The black on it did not splash; it retreated, trying to knit itself back into the ferrule and finding no seam that would hold. The little runnels that made a face of him a moment ago\u2014cheekbone shadow, socket, the hint of a jaw\u2014lost their conviction.\n\nHe snarled without voice, the throat working as though he\u2019d swallowed a burr. He reached for her with the empty hand, not for help but for the satisfaction of forward motion, and his boot bit into the grass and then into the mud that had planned this. She had planned this too; she took another back-step because sometimes the trap is the willingness to stumble. The river made a sound at her knee that, if you had no poetry, you would call glug and if you had too much, you would call invitation. She uncapped the second bottle, her hands remembering the thermos from her husband\u2019s factory nights, the tin taste and the winter steam, and she poured again. This time she went for the line where his darkness lay on the ground like fabric. The water, which was only water and did not know itself as weapon or mercy, ran into the black and the black thinned again like a rumor encountering fact.\n\nHe tried to draw the brush back and found that he could not do it clean. Fibers clung, or not fibers, whatever the shadow\u2019s equivalent of hair might be, tugging like weed-roots. For a heartbeat he was a boy in a backyard with a too-strong kite tugging at him, the wind not physics but will. He stepped after it out of habit and the bank, with the impartiality of a ledger, subtracted him a degree of balance. The bucket went over. It did not pour; it leaned and the dark inside of it tried to decide whether to answer gravity like a liquid or like a position held by a soldier. In the indecision the river found opportunity. It pulled, which is to say it recited its catechism of down, and the lip of the bucket kissed the surface and the thing in the bucket made a noise like a string snapped back on a cello and then lost shape.\n\nTo call what happened next panic would be to reduce the moment to a nervous system. He did not flail. He did something worse, which was to calculate and lose. His hand tightened on the brush, the way a person grips a talisman that has never once warranted such faith. The black that had always loved him, if love is obedience, wavered as his shadow did, its edges feathering where the river breathed. He had never looked young to her and he did not now, but the set of his shoulders admitted confusion in the language of muscle. He stepped away from the water and discovered that away had contracted. The strip of grass that had been his dry stage was a scarf, a belt, something narrow that had lost pretension to breadth. His laugh, when it came, had no shape to it. It was the laugh of a man in an elevator that has stopped between floors, hands empty, the plan a mist.\n\nShe was cold to the hip now and her joints were giving her their old lecture, but she\u2019d made promises to herself in the hours the dream with the sunflower faces had eaten. She stayed. She did again the small thing that the large thing disliked. She sloshed what remained along the toe-space of him, a line not at his body but at the insistence outside his body that dressed him. The sound it made didn\u2019t repeat; it never repeated. This time it was almost relief, like a sighed yes in a sleeping room. Shadows can\u2019t swim, Lenka had typed, and here was the footnote: they could drown or they could be rinsed away or they could snap back hard and cut. When a piece of his dark tore free and fell into the river, it made a hole where the night should have been and then the hole filled with an ordinary mid-March black. She watched the absence remembering itself into one more stripe of water.\n\nHe did not run. He shed. He let go of the brush all at once and when it hit the bank it did the worst possible thing, which was nothing. It lay like a stick. It had become a stick. Something in him swarmed, the way hornets braid when their home is kicked. He reached for the bucket and thought better of it, for the first time honoring the river. He took a step back and the knife of mud on his boot tried to cut a second step from the bank and could not. The slim humiliation of it was visible even in the dark. He looked at her as if she had relieved him of a coat and then refused to give it back, as if she had revealed an indecency. \u201cSmall lights,\u201d he said, but the words had no doctrine in them; they were rote. He tugged at the hem of his too-long coat as if to arrange a dignity that would travel and then walked the slow backward line he walked when he was on a stage he had not chosen.\n\nMr. Winn stood still until the cold worked its way through the brave and down to the practical. Her left foot was a complaint she could not ignore and the river, which respected no plan but its own, lifted a little to see if her hip might want to be a rock. She came up out of the water fox-slow, all calculation about which leg deserved to be first, the cane in a loop of strap around her wrist saving itself for the moment it would be more friend than emblem. She watched him cross the sidewalk, his shadow shortened, pinned to his heels like a one-sentence apology. He left no heel-and-toe punctuation now, just the plain grammar of boots. The bucket stayed upended, the brush a stick, the black in the grass a kind of bruise that did not spread, the night adjusting to an absence it had not known it had arranged around a man.\n\nThe bus that pulled up then was one of the hybrids, a hummed contralto riding under its breath. The driver saw her and in the space between habit and policy threw the lever that made his bus lower its knee. He came down two steps and then paused, taking in the river, the toppled things, the woman sopping at the edge of what could only look like a bad idea come to teach a class in consequences. \u201cYou all right, ma\u2019am?\u201d he asked, which was what he had to ask to unlock any other sentence. \u201cI will be,\u201d she said, which was the only answer she could trust. There were two passengers. One of them cried quietly without any connection to this scene, the kind of tired we never legislate; one of them held a bag of groceries like a baby. The driver looked past her into the dark the way you look at a dog that might or might not come when you call its name. \u201cYou want a blanket?\u201d he asked, and when she nodded he went into the belly of the bus and came back with a roll of orange wool that smelled\u2014to her surprise\u2014like clean sun.\n\nBy the time she got herself up the stairs in her building, leaving wet on each step the way a snail leaves a slick, she had made a new list in the recess where lists live. The headings were simple, the subpoints anything but. Water interrupts. Running water eats edges. The brush is not tool; it is permission. The bucket and the brush, when unaccompanied by him, revert to the world. He is bound to the thing or the thing is bound to him in the old way of stories and belts. She peeled off her wet pants in the kitchen, because it was nearer the radiator and because the kitchen had always been the bravest room in any place she\u2019d lived, and wrapped herself in the orange bus blanket for twenty civilized minutes. Then she got up, because reward is not a plan, and put the stick-that-was-a-brush and the upended bucket into the galvanized basin in the basement. She did not touch them with naked hands. It was the sort of precaution best left unspoken if you wanted anyone to take your scientific habits seriously.\n\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 arrived with the morning in his face, thread-tracks where sleep had been and left. He knocked three times and then two, the way people do when they\u2019ve practiced their courtesy. When she opened the door, he did the count in his head you only see when someone who is stubborn has done a sensible thing, and he nodded as if to say: I choose not to lecture you because it would cost too much coin from a purse you don\u2019t carry. \u201cYou look like someone who fell in a story,\u201d he said, and she made the shape of a laugh. He went to the sink without asking because the years let you and took the kettle from the stove and refilled it and set it back as if tea were as tactical as everything else he had learned to do. She told him and he wrote nothing down because the words made enough of a pattern without ink. When she got to the part where the brush became a stick, he put a hand to his mouth, not to hide surprise but to keep it from running off.\n\nThey went down to the basement together as if it were a ritual, the kind where you go toward the thing to make it less holy. The basin sat like a font someone had scooped out of the wrong religion. The bucket leaned and didn\u2019t drip. The stick lay across it with the boredom of a ruler on a desk. He reached and stopped and then reached again, because caution can topple into superstition and he had always been braver than that. His fingers went to the bucket\u2019s lip the way a locksmith goes to a key, all respect. He accelerated the world with a small tilt. They both held breath. Nothing happened except the small chuff of air that lives under emptiness. \u201cIt\u2019s not paint,\u201d he said, making factual what had been atmospheric. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cLenka writes as though we\u2019re living in a folk catalogue. Running water, bridges, invitations refused. Shadows can\u2019t swim.\u201d \u201cLenka?\u201d he asked, and she let him know what there was to tell without bending the light toward romance.\n\nIt should have been a relief and was only a shape that looked like one from a distance. He would increase patrols near the river and the markets; he would put a note on the overnight brief to ask that cruisers carry a case of bottled water meant for parched protestors and now repurposed for witchcraft. He would be laughed at by a man with teeth like polished cutlery, the laugh a thing with three syllables of contempt in it, and then later he would catch that same man undoing the top of a bottle and he would look at the ceiling and tell no one. \u201cYou\u2019ll be careful,\u201d he said, and they both let it sit on the table like a lily. \u201cI will be old,\u201d she said, which was not the same.\n\nStoneflower, which had only ever been a place for maps to find their friends, shifted its fire like any camp does when the wind misbehaves. When she typed her notes, her private was not very private because everyone who needed to know could smell when something had moved under the tent. Arkady came up from under her into the thread like a diver, leaving green trails of code and a word that no longer meant anything to younger mouths: careful. Someone in Reykjav\u00edk posted a clip, thirty seconds of a street where rain had come down and a bucket had not worked the way its carrier had hoped, which is to say the street had become crowded with the wrong kind of river and the man in the too-long coat had decided that a doorway was a better idea. Someone in Durban wrote in a clarity that cut the way good knives do: moving water is a boundary in many stories; we stop calling them stories when they are ours. They began, one of them, two of them, then eight with echo, to put blue icons next to their names, not ribbons because ribbons go hard with pride but drops, the shape so simple it tricks you into thinking it has no teeth.\n\nIn the building, Indira came with soup and expectation. \u201cI saw the blanket,\u201d she said, and Mr. Winn would later bless the universe for people who could make a syllable do that much work. They sat at the old table that had come with a man who could make what wood wants from only a knife and patience and they spoke the kind of sentences that live only between women with no desire to be applauded. They spoke about kettles and the refund the market would not give because it had spent it already and about how to put bottles near places where you might need them without becoming an advertisement for a war. Indira\u2019s niece printed flyers that said Riverwater, a tidy list of places you can fill and an even tidier list of where not to, and a note in a font that made you want to listen: we will not hunt, we will only interrupt. Someone from the second floor added in pen because pens are how revolutions remember themselves: bring cups.\n\nShe slept then, not deeply, but usefully. In the anteroom of sleep she saw the brush twitch back to being a brush like a frog unhexing to frog and she woke hurting and smiled hurt, which had been a private sport of hers since the year her husband\u2019s heart made its last, foolish noise. In the morning the graphs tried to north again and then plateaued, and the anchors\u2019 voices held a border of baffled hope the way cake holds icing on a too-hot day. Copycats who were never more than paint and bile found they were easy to pick up by the scruff when girls with water pistols pinned them at fountain\u2019s edge and sprayed and their shouts broke into adolescents\u2019 squeals against their will. The big one, the one whose not-paint starved under river rules, moved away from the damp and into the parking structures where the air is always wrong. He no longer drew lines on the ground and asked children to hop them. He put his fingers on mirrors and left the kind of smear that makes you check your face for something you cannot see.\n\nShe went with C\u00f4t\u00e9, one afternoon that pretended to be spring but was a liar, into a garage that had become a chapbook of attempts. The mirror of an elevator wore black around its frame like eyeshadow on a person who had slept in it. A line of compact cars had black hats. A last-year snowpile that had become sediment watched them from a corner with indifference. She had brought a thermos because she had learned to bring a thermos to everything, and when she unscrewed the cap the pour did something strange. It went slow where it should have gone quick. It veered like a drip finds a path along a ceiling. It made a new lace out of the black that had thought itself a stain and turned it into nothing more heroic than wet floor. The young officer at C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2019s elbow exhaled in a little hymn and then tried to put the air back in his mouth, embarrassed at having made that much emotion in front of veterans.\n\nThey made the city practice something it had never wished to be good at. Sprinklers were asked to stay up into the night. The water department, which had always thought of itself as the sibling who worked and never got invited to weddings, became the guest everyone wanted to sit beside. Hydrants were tested and their caps painted with humorous murals of fish wearing crowns because if you do not make a little joy of your tools you will grow to hate them. The night market issued its new rules in a voice grown soft with apology and stubbornness both. There would be water tents beside the tarot readers. There would be jugs beside the buses. There would be a child at a folding table with a sign that said free refills in writing that leaned to the left as if running downhill.\n\nNothing cured. He adapted. He learned the timings of sprinklers and chose hours when the water\u2019s art had ended. He ordered an umbrella from a catalogue of amusing goths and when it arrived it blazed black that was simply black, not anything more interesting. He used it primly, which was the only way he could use anything. He went indoors more. He began to sit in the last pews of churches with the confidence of a man who has confused pew for throne, and when women walked past him he hummed his anti-music and let his dark make small taps that would have been kisses if he had been a person who believed in kisses. Mr. Winn stood in a vestibule one Sunday behind a rope of old ladies whose faith was a habit and watched his dark hesitate at a dish of holy water and then move around it with a courtesy that made her laugh in a way that made the usher give her a glance he had been saving since 1973.\n\nAt night she and Indira and four others who did not need a name met in the laundromat because the hum was protective and the light was honest. They rolled coins between their fingers and talked about schedules and about whether the children should be the ones to carry the bottles because they were fast or never the ones because they were those you are obliged to shield. They talked about whether to leak the phrase shadows can\u2019t swim into the sweetpipe of the rumor machine or hold it under their tongues like a peppermint that lost its taste only slowly. Arkady wrote: secrets held too tight turn into teeth; give it away and it will be a song. Lenka wrote again and the postmark was a farm town with a name like a jar of jam and she had typed with even more inconsistency this time, the ink giving up on a couple of vowels. A river is not the only running thing, the note said. There is blood. There are crowds. There are the conveyer belts at the airport that we pretend are polite. She added in the small shame-hand: I am not joking and I am not pleased to be right.\n\nOf the things Mr. Winn had taught, one returned like a native bird. You put numbers to your feelings so they don\u2019t run away with you. A week into water, the calls edged down. The copycats lost interest when they found that women with Nerf guns and adult patience could humiliate them in the uncomplicated way that breaks a boy\u2019s willingness to be brave for the wrong prize. The tally of deaths, which had become a rope dragged behind a boat with too many bodies on it, slackened. Someone put teal ribbons on an iron fence again and their flutter did not feel like an apology no one accepted. And yet the man who was not theorem and not myth had learned the lot numbers of fear. He moved to places where water would be needle and not sheet. He learned grocery aisles, the way the misters go on and off in produce. He learned gyms, the hour their showers fail the health inspection and close. He learned how to be drought.\n\nOne evening, Arkady wrote: come to the pool. Mr. Winn took the sentence into her kitchen and asked it to sit. The pool was a city thing, a rectangle with an echo, the place where summer\u2019s children practice the small civilities of lane etiquette and winter\u2019s elders remember that their bones used to be more than columns. She went, which is to say she let herself be driven by Indira, who had a hand on the wheel that kept time with a song no one else could hear. The lifeguard, a child with shoulders like intentions, closed the doors and pulled the blinds because if you are going to change anything you must make a theatre of it. C\u00f4t\u00e9 was there, which made a wrongness right, and two women who had been painted and who wore that fact like a pin that says I voted. Arkady sat at a table with a laptop and spoke as if she were presenting a plan for a picnic: he likes mirrors; he hates surfaces he cannot count on; he would like to make this water pretend not to be itself.\n\nThey made an experiment from the awkward grace of community. They put a small pane of plexi on a pole and drew a line of his black across it. They lowered it into the water while all the bodies in the room learned to flinch at the same time. The line smudged airlessly and then unmade itself, not dissolving, no chemistry anyone in a white coat would approve, only losing the arrogance that allowed it to be a substance. It took longer than at the river because stillness defers decisions. The painted women in the corner breathed like people who have relearned a word in a language they forgot they spoke. They did it again and this time lowered the brush, which she had not wanted to touch until this moment because touching is a confession when you have been telling yourself you are a mind. The brush trembled against the surface of the water as if remembering the night it had been unmade and refused and she loved it for being wood again.\n\nThe test did not give a cure; it gave a list. Running faster works better than waiting politely. Moving water is a hungrier mouth. Distance isn\u2019t virtue; it is just distance. He, wherever he was that night, might have felt a tug in the hamstrings if that is the kind of story you allow yourself, the kind where the villain\u2019s muscles know when his tools are misbehaving. Mr. Winn sat on the staging and put her feet into the shallow end and ate a piece of chocolate that had been in her pocket since October and tasted of lint and found it exquisite. C\u00f4t\u00e9 stood near the door and talked into his phone with the patience of a man explaining arithmetic to a budget. Arkady packed the laptop with the tenderness people reserve for instruments that have failed them and might yet surprise them. Indira leaned her head on Mr. Winn\u2019s shoulder in a way that said: even warriors have necks.\n\n\u201cPaint is confession,\u201d she told the quiet on their way home, because it had been waiting, wanting to be said not to a recording but to a road. If he were only paint, the confession would have been: I am lazy, I am mean, I am jubilant at my own power. If he was the dark of a thing that eats light, the confession might be: I am hungry and I mistook my hunger for a map. She did not forgive him. She did not make a speech about forgiveness in her head. She named the things she knew how to name. Buildings, streets, the crook in the river, the woman who sang on the porch three doors down in a voice that had never been paid. Her heart did its old skipping trick and then remembered itself and she blessed it for its learning.\n\nHe was not gone. He sat in a booth in a diner that still had the original tiles and watched a waitress brush crumbs into her palm and told himself a story about crumbs and women that would have made a smaller man blush. He watched the window, the way the snow-scar on the curb had turned to a gutter of water and none of it had come into the diner because some buildings have opinions and some doors honor them. He thought about the river and how it had spoken back to him and he felt, for the first time, the pressure of choosing. He could leave. He could go to a city that had paved its river into an act of memory. He could become rumor only and surrender the weight of boots. The comment sections would still float him. He could be borne.\n\nBut there was a bus stop by a hospital he hated for the way it let women emerge stronger than when they went in, as if brokenness were only an opinion. He thought of that glass, how he had once stroked it and made the ad below it choke on a kiss it had not invited. He stood and the diner\u2019s bell on the door made a noise that had been someone\u2019s idea of cheerful. He left his coffee half-drunk because leaving a thing uncompleted was his private sacrament. He walked in that measured way that made the air think twice and the women at the counter leaned toward each other the way birds do when hawks are above. Outside the snowmelt had its own plans. He did not alter his route for water; he did not yet believe in priests.\n\nMr. Winn watched the hospital stop from a distance that kept faith with both prudence and desire. She had a thermos because she would always have a thermos now like people have their keys. She had a girl from the eighth who had spent the summer interning at City and knew how to talk to a parking authority so they beam smoothed instead of roughing up. The glass of the shelter was new and therefore felt brave, and she admired it the way you admire a child winning the first time at anything. When he came, he came like weather called by a conductor. He did not look up at the cameras because he no longer cared about those eyes. He put his two fingers on the glass as if he were greeting it like an old friend. The black tried to come forward with him like a well-trained pet and then stopped with its nose up against the new film some municipal genius had spread with a roller at three that morning, a film that promised hydrophilicity in the kind of brochure that would not normally travel far from trade shows.\n\nHe pressed. He pulled back. The smear he made attempted to be a smear and met its litigant in the thin wet that the film called up from air almost by thought. It would not hold. The ad below, cheap and earnest, did not choke. It simply looked back through the wet at him with the stupid dignity of printed eyes. He let his hand fall. He hummed his un-melody. He turned his head because something had changed and you always turn your head toward change the way you turn toward a dropped tray in a restaurant. Two women step toward him not to attack and not to scold but to stand. They had badges, not police, not anything that will ever carry a gun, badges that said volunteer and a drop shape, and their bodies made a shadow on his shadow the way clouds make promises to fields. He chose not to move at all. He chose to own immobility as if it were skill.\n\nHe stared at the hospital doors and she stared at the bend in the river where it cleared its throat before it mazed through town. She did not look at him. She did not make herself a mirror. She lifted the thermos and poured water in a small curve along the lip of the shelter\u2019s slab and the water went on doing, in this dry season of men\u2019s making, what it had decided to do before men. The volunteer on the right told a joke about hydrants so quiet the other volunteer had to lean to hear it and they both smiled in a way that made the air less sure of itself. Mr. Winn took a new page in her marbled notebook when she got home and wrote on it with a linearity that would have made her younger self smirk. Stories require boundaries. Shadow requires surface. Water upsets both. He requires applause. We can practice silence. She wrote practice twice because everyone always forgets that the word is both noun and verb, both plan and doing.\n\nThat night the building\u2019s roof collected the faintest of rains and the buckets placed there by superstitious women and one good-natured super made small sounds of satisfaction. The internet, which had never loved her, loved what she and Arkady did not claim to have invented and therefore could not be caught taking credit for. There were videos of children\u2014yes, she had lost this argument\u2014holding up mister bottles like talismans and spraying as if christening streets. There were aunties tying ribbons with the drop shape around spigots and hoses. There was a woman in Lagos who said in her calm camera voice: we do not purify him; we do not purify ourselves; we make him slip. There was a priest in a collar not yet yellowed who said: we always had this; we baptized and forgot how.\n\nThe next morning, the envelope on her door had no postmark at all. The letters had been glued in the way of a school project, cut from newspapers and from the edges of magazines that would be missed only by people who care about font. It said, in the flat poetry of threats: rivers dry. She held the card over the sink as if the sink would catch any extra ugliness and she laughed, because people who think themselves storms always forget that storms travel, that there are lakes, that there are pipes, that there are mouths and if they are all you have left you make a river of them too. She got her coat. She tucked the note into the old cookbook she never used because good measures are not always recipes. She went to the elevator and the black on the mirror there had been washed again into ordinary by some underpaid person\u2019s deliberate kindness, and she blessed that person with the decency of anonymity. On the way down she practiced the sentence in her head that she would say to C\u00f4t\u00e9. It was not: we are winning. It was: we are learning.\n\nAcross town, in a garage that took its smells from tires and metal and tired men, he stood with his palm pressed flat to a pillar and felt the vibration of a freight elevator he hadn\u2019t known was there. He liked the feeling because it made him think he was in the world and not merely on it, but then he had always mistaken vibrations for invitation. He tried again the old trick of the brush and found it made nothing but black that wanted to be a stare and could only be blink. He straightened and the men at the workbench found themselves too careful with their wrenches. He picked up a rag someone had left and he carried it with him down the ramp and out into the late day, and if you had looked from far you would have said: a janitor on his way to the next mess. If you had looked closer you would have seen a man practicing an intimacy and failing. If you had looked closer still, you would have seen the place where the rag was dark remember ordinary dirt and dismiss anything grander.\n\nHe went to the river anyway because hunger will visit the house that has locked its doors and will sing under the window until someone cries uncle. He stood on the bank above the deep he had underestimated and wished with an intensity he had only ever lavished on women\u2019s fear. He wished he could believe in something older than his wanting. The river said none of this out loud. It did not gloat like men who win. It went on with its list: stone, leaf, paper, light. It took the city\u2019s talk about it and sluiced that too. It did not refuse him because it is not a person. It refused to be his. That was enough. He turned, and the print he left on the path was ordinary and then there was the smallest sound, a bead of water falling from a branch onto a dried leaf, and he flinched like a horse.\n\nShe sat at her window and let herself be an oak when she was only a woman. She put her hand flat on the glass the way you do when a cat insists on being on the wrong side of a door. Her granddaughter texted her a string of nonsense that resolved into the picture of the child\u2019s hand held under a faucet, water pearling at the base of the thumb, a caption from a life Mr. Winn had not lived at that age: like armor. She wrote back a heart, the old boring emblem that is sometimes a good, quiet truth. She turned off the radio because the farm report had become a dirge in its insistence on the price of corn when she wanted the price of us. She said out loud, to the much-underrated saints of plumbing: keep time with me. Then she did the math on the back of an envelope again like a woman after war, dividing what we have by how many we are and discovering with astonishment what will do when we let it.",

Use less, it said, with the tone of a parent who has been kind for too long. Use smart, the same note added, as if smart could be folded into a faucet. Mr. Winn stood over her sink and did the arithmetic no one who writes those notices ever shows their work on. There were gallons whose destiny was a lawn. There were gallons that were already promised to teeth and tea and a thousand small cleanlinesses. There were gallons that, poured at a bus shelter at the right second, could interrupt a man who had mistaken attention for oxygen. She made a list of taps the city could loosen without killing its own: hydrants for six sharp minutes on the quarter hours when shifts changed, cooling misters that would be fed by the graywater that no one believed in until the word gray turned out to be a kind of moral help. She wrote to a councilor who liked to be the first to know and the reply came back with the pace of a person who peeks over the cubicle wall: come say that into a microphone so that I can be the one who thanks you for it.\n\nStoneflower thrummed not with panic but with project. Arkady posted a video of a fan fitted with a hoop of foil streamers that churned the light in a room until the shadow in it could not stand still long enough to call itself anything but weather. It was nothing like science and everything like it, in the way of kitchen experiments that become recipes because a thousand hands stir them exactly the same wrong way. Someone in Winnipeg replaced the tinsel with strips cut from Mylar blankets they handed out at races and found that moving reflection worked as well as moving water when it came to making darkness lose track of its own outline. The thread became a bazaar of improvised flows: bead curtains that shivered when doors opened, sheets pegged to clotheslines over sidewalks and flapped by box fans stolen from bedrooms, panels on rolling casters that pushed wind ahead of them the way children push enthusiasm. Arkady wrote in a lower font, because of course she did: it is not that we are trying to blind him; we are trying to keep him from finding a surface to be sure of.\n\nHe, who had built his church out of the small faiths of strangers\u2019 faces, adapted with the stubborn purity of a man determined to be original in an era that had no use for originals. He moved away from places that glistened and into places with carpet. He discovered that the black of him could sit, complacent, on upholsteries where water was a threat to deposit rather than a promise to cleanse, and for a spell he haunted waiting rooms the way a bad smell does. He hummed his hurt-music and trailed fingers near the photographs of mountains that administrative assistants put on walls to say: look, we are not a machine, we have views. The volunteers learned to carry sprayers with diluted detergent and to ask receptionists for rags with a conspirator\u2019s smile that made those women feel suddenly and correctly like the keepers of the city. He went to the hospital lobby once more, and the film\u2014some clever soul\u2019s hydrophilic darling\u2014made him scowl because it was invisible and effective, the two things he hates.\n\nThe doctor at her heart clinic listened to Winnifred\u2019s chest and frowned thoughtfully in that way medical school teaches you when the truth is: I would put you in a box if I could and take you home like a rare bread, just to keep listening. His stethoscope was cold. His hands were not. He said the word arrhythmia as if he were afraid he might bruise it. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s been a companion,\u201d and then surprised them both by naming it Teddy, which made him chuckle and made the nurse look down so that her face might not betray her pleasure. \u201cDo not forget that even the best companions know when to go quiet,\u201d the doctor said, which was his way of saying: rest when you can and don\u2019t play at hero. Her granddaughter showed up that afternoon with a plastic tub of chopped fruit and a plan that consisted mostly of standing in the doorway and being eighteen in a way that air likes. They looked at photographs in an album that smelled of basements and of the kind of paper no one makes anymore. The girl traced faces with one finger as if those people were all in there still, moving.\n\nIt was Lenka\u2019s second letter that pushed them to a place no city is ever truly prepared to be comfortable with. Conveyors, she had typed badly, and added a sketch of an airport walkway that had been cut from a magazine years ago and taped to a page in a way that said she\u2019d been saving it for the day it became what it was not. Mr. Winn took it to Indira, who had a cousin on a union executive that still believed solidarity could be tasted. C\u00f4t\u00e9 reached for the lever that made official channels move; he did not pull it gracefully because nothing with that many pulleys can be stroked, but he pulled. The airport director met them with the face of a woman who had negotiated with weather and with pilots who thought they were weather and did not enjoy admitting that a small old woman with a cane had brought her something she could use. \u201cTell me the version that makes me look savvy in a memo,\u201d the director said, which is to say she was ready.\n\nYou never see an airport quiet unless you are either very early or very wrong. The night they took it for themselves, the place hummed like an aquarium. Belts that spent their days shouldering luggage wore only light now and the squeak of bearings that would be greased in the morning by a man named for his grandfather. A custodian whose name was stitched in blue stood with his mop like a spear and blessed them with an expression he probably used when his team scored, if he ever went to games. Mr. Winn placed her hand on the moving walkway\u2019s rubber edge and felt the minute inconsistent bumps that have no poetry until you need them and then they become the stanza you can recite by heart. Arkady activated the curtains, a shiver of water that was not theatrical enough to make toddlers clap and not brutal enough to make teenagers post, just enough to count as running in the right way. They put out cones in a pattern that would make a herd flow without making it feel herded, because Lenka\u2019s note had told them: crowds have current when they choose to.\n\nHe came with his own weather. Of course he did. He had read the rumor the way a man reads his reflection in a window and declares himself handsome because the night allows it. He did not like airports because airports do not care what you like; they are rituals that swallow individuality and spit it back in the exact bag it arrived in. He walked with the disdain that says men in vests should move aside and they did, because vests do not pay them enough to argue with disdain. The brush had been replaced because sticks do not resurrect and there is always another brush in the town that sells Home Improvement to men who are looking for a version of fatherhood. He aimed it at the chrome panelling along the moving walkway, which had been polished by boredom into a mirror so complacent it did not expect to be asked to do any work. When the black met movement, when the bristles found that their certainty ran away from them a fraction of an inch each second without ever consenting to be a single surface, it did not hold. It scummed and slipped and made the sound of teeth lightly worrying glass without leaving a bite.\n\nThe belts ran not fast, because this city was not a city that ever truly rushed, but with a confidence that belonged to machines and to rivers both. Volunteers stepped onto the belt in twos the way a dance begins at a wedding when the DJ knows something about age. They moved along him without stopping and their bodies made a current that bent his shadow oddly, pulling it toward their ankles the way grass leans toward a storm. One woman\u2019s purse brushed his coat and the small apology she gave out of habit was like a blessing he did not know how to receive. He reached for the chrome again and a curtain whispered between his hand and the panel, a mist that did what water does when it is asked politely to decide against the continuation of a mistake. His hum lost confidence. He tried concrete\u2014always a good friend to him in the old days\u2014and found that the film the contractor had laid overnight at the direction of a woman he had never learned the name of made concrete act less like a wall and more like the skin of a fish half out of water.\n\nMr. Winn stood where the belt spit people back into their own legs and she used the lip of her thermos cap the way you would use a thimble to stop blood: precise, unpanicked, repetitive. There was a part of her that grew impatient with the theater of it, not because the work was melodramatic\u2014it was not\u2014but because she had always hated spectacle and here was one of theirs even if it was quieter than he would have asked. C\u00f4t\u00e9 kept up a cheerful murmur into his radio that sounded to anyone who did not know him like a man trying to make a burger order more interesting, and to anyone who did like a string you use when you want to keep a kite from bolting. The belt lifted his dark in slices that did not want to be slices and carried them toward the end where a catchment waited, a trough that the maintenance crew had insisted on calling a fish ladder until the looks from the women in the room made them try again and land on the less romantic\u2014and therefore more useful\u2014term trap. The pieces fell in and made a sulk on the surface. The tiny pump there, the only part of this entire evening that had been expensive enough to make an invoice blush, sent the sulk through a baffle and the sulk forgot that it had ever been a plan.\n\nHe went for the crowd then, which he had never dared because crowds can become something else if you get the scale wrong. He pointed the brush into the tide of women and men and teenagers who had decided that evening that they would practice being a river, and he found that fabric does what mirrors do not: it forgives. The black clung where it landed but it didn\u2019t stay like a thought you can never shake. It smeared into motion and the motion became its own argument. The volunteers wore clothes they had rehearsed in: slicker fabric, old acrylic sweaters that did not keep stains the way a mother keeps grudges, skirts with panels that caught air. A mister hissed where a ceiling tile had been levered out, and the water fell not in big humiliations but in thin, unspectacular lines that you could mistake for a leak if you wanted to. It was enough. His hum turned into what it might have been once before someone told him he was interesting: a habit.\n\nHe dropped the brush when it remembered its first job again, a little too dramatically, like a bad actor\u2019s idea of surrender. The handle bounced on the belt and went skittering down it and three hands reached to pluck it aside before someone fell. He had an umbrella in his coat, which would have made him ridiculous if ridiculous were not often a glove that fits evil perfectly, and he yanked it open in an arc that pushed two people to their heels. The water somewhere described a curve, not dramatic, not even particularly pretty, and struck the umbrella\u2019s skin with a tiny percussion that belonged to summer porches. The black on the umbrella sulked and ran toward the ribs and gathered there into the sort of little puddles that cannot be seen from far. He looked smaller. He always had, a geometry of confidence rather than of height, but this was new: the light in the room had learned him and it kept its opinion.\n\nThey did not catch him. If this were the kind of story where triumph feels like a parade, they would have. A manager with a badge in a clip on his belt would have stepped forward with cuffs and the crowd would have made that applause that tells everyone we are grateful not because we are safe but because we have remembered a rule. He found a seam in the event the way a mouse finds one in a sack of grain, and he went through it with a quickness that took years off him. He left his umbrella open and the janitor with the stitched name lifted it in both hands like a small overturned boat and carried it as if it might bite. The belts ran for another twenty minutes just because it felt good to let something we had asked to do a job keep doing it after the reason had wandered off. The maintenance crew took apart the trap with the tenderness of men who have been mocked for their bulk and know the truth about delicacy, and what they put in a bag to send to a lab looked like the lint that dryers spit out when whole families have been washing clothes all day.\n\nAfterwards, the airport director sat on a bench with Mr. Winn and let her head fall back to look at the ceiling, which was dull and dimpled like the underbelly of a whale in photographs. \u201cI hate that we did something smart,\u201d she said, and then clarified, because she was an honest woman when allowed to be: \u201cI hate that we had to.\u201d Mr. Winn said nothing because it is not polite to tell a person: you are living the moment when you discover that competence is merely the beginning. Indira handed out cups because she had insisted on bringing them, because she had written Bring cups! in pen on a flyer and pens are for this. Arkady sat on the floor in a way that suggested her bones were jointed differently than other people\u2019s and rubbed her eyes under her glasses with the heel of her hand like a person bargaining with a headache. C\u00f4t\u00e9 took a call he did not want and afterward he said to no one and everyone: he\u2019ll try the dam or he\u2019ll try the places where wheels never stop. \u201cWe cannot flood a bridge,\u201d someone said, and Mr. Winn said, \u201cMaybe we can.\u201d\n\nHe went to the river that night because he had nowhere else to go that would speak to him without sarcasm. The water looked up at him with its usual attention span, which is to say it did not hold a grudge and it did not forget. He stared at the dam and thought as hard as he could, which was a kind of apology, a child\u2019s offering of effort. He imagined a dozen ways to make a wound in it and his mind lapped at each the way a tongue laps at a sore tooth. A man came and stood twenty yards away and put a cigarette in his mouth and then did not light it. They shared the silence the way two dogs share the shade of a small tree: without making rules about it. He thought about leaving because men like him always think there is a city somewhere that will not make them work this hard for attention. He imagined deserts. He liked the word because it didn\u2019t ask you to learn the trick of its spelling until too late and he appreciated any word that resented correction.\n\nAt home, Mr. Winn told her kitchen about conveyance because kitchens are where movement begins in a house, in pots, in kettles, in drawers that slide because someone cared enough to get the rails right. They had learned to run water through the evening and to make light misbehave. They had learned to be a crowd that did not become mob. She made a list that had no bullets because this was not war and yet had the smell of it. She wrote: belts, fans, lungs. She wrote: buses lower for old bones\u2014ask the drivers to linger the way they do when the woman with a walker needs a second. She wrote: the dam is not an enemy; it is a rhythm that can be interrupted without revenge. She wrote: the story is a river too; stop feeding it names and the fish will have to learn to eat plants. Her hand hurt when she\u2019d finished and she pressed the heel of it into her own palm and felt the pulse that had been Teddy\u2019s and thought about what it means for an old body to return to a fight one last time and find it still knows every step.\n\nLenka came as lightly as a letter when she did, months late and exactly on time, and the knock she made on the door was the sort made by someone who has calculated the cost of being turned away and will still call it a bargain if it happens. She stood on the thresh and two women whose hair remembered different climates looked each other into the present. They did not hug because there are reunions that deserve patience, and because both of them had learned that any abruptness invites the body to do things it will later resent. They sat because sitting is a discipline. Lenka\u2019s face had made decisions without asking her, which is what faces do when we turn our attention to the state of the world and away from mirrors. \u201cConveyors,\u201d she said, and laughed until her eyes found water that had nothing to do with misters. \u201cYou always did take my homework too seriously,\u201d Mr. Winn answered, and their tea was exactly the right temperature, as if a cue had been thrown from a booth.\n\nThe night market returned like a child who has learned a new word it can\u2019t stop repeating, and the organizers threaded lines above the stalls that tugged bits of foil in breeze. The dumpling cart steamed its offerings like small fogs and young men in shirts with sleeves rolled carefully to the elbow leaned beside it trying to remember why they had decided this was handsome. The bus shelter at the edge had a different photograph in it now, a picture of a woman in a hard hat smiling not at the camera but at something to its left, as if she were getting a joke no one had told and it still amused her. He stood across the street and weighed the market with his eyes the way an angler weighs a stream, and then he did something that nearly hurt her more than the things he had loved to do. He turned away. He did not want to perform where the stage had learned him. He wanted a new audience, though he would never admit that the word he really meant was victim. The city felt the way you feel when you see a hawk change course; it means salvation for some small birds and it means later for others.\n\nThey practiced silence in a way that nearly felt religious if you did not bring God to it. The drop pins multiplied but they did not add glitter to themselves, which was a kind of discipline that impressed Mr. Winn. People filmed less; or if they filmed, they handed their footage to Stoneflower without posting, and the site accepted the work the way a river accepts a piece of bread thrown to it by a toddler who believes in ducks. The anchors learned a new tone\u2014one that reported without rendering\u2014and when a woman in a newsroom slipped and said his name, her cohost touched her forearm lightly to say: remember, we have learned not to feed the river with that. The police, who had been forced by their funding and by their pride into pretending that water curtains were not part of law, began to carry hose couplers with the same absentminded ease with which they had always carried pens. In the laundromat, they pinned a new schedule near the coin machine, not of washing cycles but of shifts for the misters near the university tunnel, and the sound of quarters dropping into the slot had never been so companionable.\n\nHe went inland in his mind. He stood in a warehouse where boxes moved on belts he could not see the ends of and thought about what it would be like to make those belts hate themselves. He imagined painting the packages not with black but with the habit of hesitation. He lifted the brush and he drew a line on the metal lip of a chute and for a split second the line pretended it had a future. Then the chute shook the way a throat does when laughter will not be held and the line fractured, ran, and became a question that did not want his answer. He put the brush to the floor and felt ridiculous and did not like the feeling and did it again in spite of himself because sometimes practice is just cruelty that cannot climb. He was not a man given to private prayers, but he discovered a superstition in himself that had been waiting for an invitation: he began to walk with his palm pressed to things that held motion and to feel for their pulse, as if he could borrow it.\n\nMr. Winn dreamed of rivers whose names she had known when she was young and studying geography not because she believed in empire but because she understood that if you are going to fight anything you ought to know its shape. The Volta braided itself with the Grand, and a creek that had been nothing but a dysfunction behind her childhood school offered her a gold coin it made out of a pop-top. She woke with the sentence that she had disliked when it came in a textbook: calculate your losses now so that you will not be surprised. She put coffee on because she could and she sat at the table because it was there and she used a pen that had trouble starting because the ink had been allowed to think too long and she made two columns. On one side, she wrote what he had not yet done, because even monsters have boundaries they do not know they honor. On the other, she wrote what they had learned to do not because any of them were brave but because practice had made them competent. In the middle, she left a strip of paper blank and didn\u2019t name it anything, because sometimes you have to leave the river a place to run that is not through your house.\n\nWhen the rain came, it came wrong. It came sideways first, and then it came in the tight fists that make gutters forget their jobs. It came hard enough that a woman on television said the word biblical without irony and then apologized to no one because she had meant it. The dam held in the way good engineering does, which is to say it did not ask to be admired. Downstream the river took liberties it had not asked permission for in years. A man in a red car stalled his engine in the middle of the underpass and it looked for all the world like an expensive toy being baptized against its will. Volunteers moved their misters into basements and pointed them at stairwells because there is no rule that says a river cannot run up for a while if you give it a little help. He stood on a bridge that the city had not thought to test with the elegance of feet and remembered that he had once laughed at the idea that water could be asked to do a job.\n\nIt was never a victory. That would have required the neatness of endings and this was an age of edits. It was, instead, a ritual they learned to keep. Volunteers with cups, and a patch of foil in a child\u2019s backpack that made a bright constant noise as he ran, and a traffic cop who turned hydrants at the quarter hour the way he\u2019d been told and added a minute because he could feel in his knee that the dark was near. It was an old woman with a cane who did not change the city so much as she taught it to use a set of muscles it had not known it still had. It was a man who had mistaken hunger for map learning to stand in doorways he used to stride through and feel, for the first time in his adult life, the press of other people\u2019s pace against his own. It was a story that had thought itself a river learning it could be dammed by silence, by misters, by the sound of a bus lowering a knee for bones and lifting again. It was not enough. It was, which is what the world offers most days, more than yesterday and hard-won.",

                              "content": "Chapter 6\n\nSpring came in increments that felt like a child counting too fast, and the city tried to keep up without spraining anything important. Leaves went from coins to hands. Potholes blossomed with the annual arrogance of things that know you will forgive them because you must. The river moved from a winter sermon to a conversational tone, and in its voice you could hear the work of all those small pumps and misters and buckets that had been enlisted into a militia nobody had planned on forming. Mr. Winn had a new way of keeping time, a practice that would have made her former self roll her eyes, and it went like this: how many buses bowed for bones today, how many hydrants sighed for six minutes, how many belts hummed their quiet hymn. Numbers gave her nerves a place to sit. They stayed on their chairs more often now.\n\nIn the council chamber with its bad flags and its chairs that seemed designed to make backs suspicious of sitting, she sat at a microphone and did not let her hands perform. The councilor who liked to be first had introduced her as a citizen scientist which was not a thing she was and yet had its uses in that room. She had put on a jacket that could pretend to authority and had tucked her cane up beside the desk so as not to let anyone offer to help her with what she did not need help with. \u201cWe are not at war with water,\u201d she said, and heard in her own voice the old teacher who could insist a problem had a solution because the children would be safer if they believed it. \u201cWe are not at war with him, either, if you mean by war that we make him larger to feel ourselves brave. This is a maintenance problem. It is a city problem. It is the problem of keeping things moving when fear would like to stop them.\u201d She laid out her lists in the language of budgets because that is a dialect politicians will always meet you in a hallway to speak. When she reached the part where she asked for the sprinklers in the underpass to be switched from ornamental to tactical, the councilor who wore disapproval like a starched shirt sighed audibly and asked about costs like a man who has never met a life that counted more than a line of numbers. She did not tell him that he had miscounted his own value; she explained graywater again with the patience of someone who would prefer not to die on this hill and then die anyway if required.\n\nAfterward in the hallway, the first-to-know councilor confided that a marketing firm had approached her about the drops. \u201cWe could make it a campaign,\u201d the woman said, showing the whites of her eyes the way nervous horses do when a plastic bag blows in a yard. \u201cWe could put sponsors on the misters. We could sell branded umbrellas that actually catch the\u2014\u201d and then she stopped because even she could hear the word and its weight. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to tell you this kindly,\u201d Mr. Winn said, and realized she didn\u2019t much care whether kindness was necessary, \u201cbut you cannot merchandise a boundary. Leave us the plainness of it. Let the drops be unhandsome. Let there be no mascot.\u201d The woman nodded the way people nod when they have already chosen, and Mr. Winn could see the pins with their gloss finish and their tidy fonts, and she could see also the first fundraiser held under a tent in a gated backyard while gardeners made the hedges pretend to be forest. She went home more tired than she had expected to be.\n\nTiredness, which had always been a companion, learned a new trick. It found her in bright places and asked to sit in her lap. She could be content one minute arranging the bowls in the drainer by size\u2014the geometry of drying a religion she had never betrayed\u2014and the next her heart would write its old skipping signature so elaborately that her hands would go cold. The doctor\u2019s warning about best companions needing to go quiet occasionally came back like a tune she didn\u2019t like but could not stop humming. On a Tuesday that had promised to be ordinary from the way the radio announcer said the name of the month, she set a cup down on the table too hard and the sound made a hole in her attention large enough that she had to sit before the floor remembered it was not a lake. Indira came with a kind firm mouth and a set of keys in her hand as if she might need to drive a thought somewhere that couldn\u2019t get there on its own. They went to the clinic and the nurse at the counter said, \u201cHi, Mr. Winn,\u201d in that easy way that says I am not going to argue with anyone\u2019s name, and they orchestrated a day out of blood pressure cuffs and a machine that recorded heartbeats with a pencil that was not a pencil. She watched the pencil make the mountain range of her chest on paper and wondered how many peaks an old woman is allowed.\n\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 met them in the lobby because his beat now included any place where the city\u2019s air changed its mind. He held the elevator for them with a hand that refused to be dramatic about it and they rode up in a box where the mirror had no bruises, only a film you could not see, and the smudge of someone's hand that had been wiped away by a person who would go home after midnight and sleep with their socks on. \u201cHe came,\u201d the guard said from the desk where the calls make their low tide noise. \u201cHe came and he tried to make the door forget itself and it did not.\u201d They watched the security footage because that\u2019s what we do when the world has found a way to imitate myth; we seek proof in pixels and in the slowed-down version where sometimes you can catch intention in the way a shoulder lifts. He looked the same as he always did\u2014merely large, the way a resented chore is large\u2014and he did the same thing he always did, the not-touch that is a violation precisely because it doesn\u2019t need your skin. The door remembered itself. It remembered the joke of the hydrophilic film. It remembered that it was the kind of door that would always open for a woman with a folded sweater and a paper with a lab number on it and that it would sulk and refuse him as long as the city fed it that memory. He held his two fingers on the glass for a long time, as if he had found a nerve in it he could hold, and then he laughed, not loudly, just enough to make the light in the camera wobble as if laughter had mass. He left without a flourish, the worst insult he could give to his own appetite.\n\nThe night after, Stoneflower organized what Arkady insisted on calling the Hush Walk, a phrase that made Mr. Winn wince until she saw what the words had bought them. No signs, because slogans are bait. No chant, because chants want microphones. They walked the usual route that protests take through the downtown, that strangely ceremonial line that makes a city remember where its edges are. They wore foil that bent the light with all the subtlety of a cheap disco, not because anyone wanted to be festive but because it unsettled his shadow\u2019s certainty about where to lay its head. They carried cups because Indira had written it on a flyer and because a woman in the third row had brought a thermos of broth and had learned that if you offer a thing hot and honest enough people will throw away their pride. Children wheeled those little fans on sticks that spin themselves silly and their parents made faces like they were worried about readiness and then stopped because readiness is a habit that either grows or doesn't and fear has never watered it properly. The only noise besides feet and the small machines was the bus that kneeled at each stop along the route even when no one asked because the driver was in on it and because mercy, when it practices, makes rituals beautiful.\n\nHe did not show himself that night, which did not mean he wasn\u2019t there. He had learned to study the city the way a predator studies the waterholes on a nature program, the careful patience that is really just a refusal to work harder than hunger demands. He watched the foil make the shadows jitter and remembered boys with cameras at concerts holding their phones up like rosaries to music they believed in without knowing what belief costs. He walked parallel to them three streets over and hummed his wrong hymn and let the black he wore dribble onto the walls of a quiet lane where no one would see until morning, the vandalism equivalent of muttering. A man sweeping his stoop along that lane stepped accidentally into the run of it and found that his boot did not carry the mess the way tar would have. He was spared the humiliation of tracking a stain into his kitchen, and he went inside and told no one because he did not yet know it was a story. The city learned in those little unwitnessed mercies as much as in any coordinated act.\n\nMr. Winn\u2019s granddaughter came to one Hush Walk with a friend whose jacket was the loud yellow of an idea you refuse to let anyone squint at and their hands stayed near each other not because they were afraid but because contact is a river too. They walked beside Mr. Winn for a block and a half and then went ahead in the natural rhythm of young and old bodies, and a thing happened that Mr. Winn would have called coincidence if she had not been in a season when coincidence felt like instrument. The mist from a mister caught the light from a streetlamp and made a veil across an alley mouth and in that veil stood a shadow waiting to be invited to be bold. It reached for her girl with an old reflex and found itself hesitating, not because of the water alone but because her girl was moving with other girls, a small crowd, and the tide of them would have made any paint choose to cling to one and not another and the indecision killed it. The black hesitated, faltered, sought a surface larger than a pocket, and then slunk back to his boots as if embarrassed. Later the granddaughter sent three messages with no words and a picture of the alley and a sentence: it was smaller when we were together, and perhaps this is what coming of age looks like under new rules.\n\nWhen the first branded drop pins showed up on a city employee\u2019s lanyard six weeks later, they were plain enough that the temptation to sneer passed without incident. The firm, it turned out, had contained within it a woman who had understood the assignment. The pins were matte. They did not glint. They had a small scratchable texture that made anxious hands calm down, and inside the pin behind the enamel a very cheap disc of foil moved when you moved, only a little, only enough to make light misbehave microscopically. The councilor who had wanted mascots sent an email saying see? and Arkady sent back three words that had the weight of a poem: you did not ruin. Later, at a farmer\u2019s market that had become an impromptu clinic for useful things, Mr. Winn watched a man who had worked a night shift rub his thumb over one of those drops and put his shoulders down an inch and buy tomatoes that were too expensive and go home to sleep with less noise in his hair.\n\nThe man they had refused to name discovered that being thwarted repeatedly was not as interesting as he had hoped, and something in him that had practiced waiting went bad. He grew sloppy. In a library where the air is always cool in the way of places that harbor memory, he slid two fingers along a display case holding a map of the city drawn when millers and Mennonites had first agreed about bridges. The black tried to make the paper forget itself and failed in the precise square where the volunteer on duty had wiped it that morning with a cloth dipped in a little diluted detergent and water and a little prayer uttered beneath a breath. He did not like defeat in corners. He shied from that square the way animals learn to shy from electric fences when the shock has no poetry and therefore is terrifying. He went for the plexiglass instead and watched the swirls of his not-paint bunch at the fasteners and then retreat as if legal counsel had been called.\n\nThere was talk of drought. The weather app rearranged its icons into a gallery of suns that had no right to be smug, and people at bus stops said, \u201cWell, at least we\u2019ll have the beach,\u201d in that false-bright tone that always accompanies small preemptive submissions. Public Works sent another letter. Use less, it said again, and this time the people with hoses made faces because they had grown to love the feeling of agency you get when water leaves you on purpose. Mr. Winn looked at her lists and felt that familiar clutch in her chest that is not fear but math, the calculation of what can be spared. She made a plan with Arkady that involved the thing they had learned at the airport: moving boundaries do not require volume. She wrote letters to the building supers and to the custodians whose respect she had always coveted more than a principal\u2019s and she explained fans and foil and bead curtains in the language of maintenance and utility and cleaning budgets, and the custodians loved her not because she made their work glamourous but because she had noticed that theirs is the labor upon which any ritual stands. They set box fans at the mouths of corridors and hung light chains of reflective strips a child had cut from Mylar blankets in an art class from hooks that had been bored long ago for Christmas wreaths. The air became a river lazy enough not to be wasteful and noisy enough to unsettle shadow.\n\nHe tried to be clever and went to the parks not for the women but for the monuments, an escalation hidden in taste. He dragged his brush along a bronze shoe the size of a dog and watched the black slip and fail and gather in a seam where a sculptor had offered it shelter. He liked the idea of mocking metal because metal pretends to permanence, and he drew a line up the side of a soldier issued by history for pious purposes. There, too, the city had anticipated him, not with film but with the simplest of all acts: washing. A boy in a volunteer\u2019s vest sprayed the statue with a bottle that had once held cleaner for kitchens and the black did that little soundless pop that meant it had gotten confused about what surface it was on. He turned and there in the distance he saw foil ribbon in birches and Mylar fish hung from a line like holiday in a language no one speaks anymore. His hum drooped. He had not expected tree-light to betray him.\n\nAt night, when she allowed herself the old bad habit of imagining conversation with a person who had harmed her city, she stopped offering him education and began offering him boredom. She pictured saying: we will not chase you. We will not film you. We will maintain without telling you. You will find doors that do not love you and corridors that breathe wrong and rails that are always a little damp when you are near. She would prefer to leave him to his hunger rather than feed it with outrage like sugar water. She did not try the speech on the air because speaking out loud has gravity; it pulls worlds into being. She spoke it into the steam above her kettle and felt the plea go up with it, a small weather making a roof under the big weather. Then she turned off the radio because even voices she trusted had begun to speculate again, and speculation is delicious and lazy and makes you feel like you have done something when you have not.\n\nLenka, who had come and stayed as if the city were a sofa you can nap on regardless of who pays the rent, wrote her third note at the table without ceremony. The ribbon of typing had become more exhausted; the e looked chewed by a mouse. Breath is a river if you let it be, she wrote, and smiled that the page could hold a sentence so silly and so exact at the same time. Mr. Winn thought about lungs and about the fans and about the whisper at the airport and she thought about the first time she had been told to blow out a candle on a birthday cake and had not understood until her father had bent his head and demonstrated and had grinned at her because men with grease on their fingers get to be tender only when something needs teaching that looks like a trick. She met Arkady at the pool and they watched the humidity rise on the glass like intent and they tested again with a line and a breath and found that exhale is not water but is disobedient enough to be useful. They taught the volunteers the trick of breathing across a threat and laughed because it felt like magic when it was only physics and felt like prayer when it was only practice repeated until the body adopts it.\n\nHe tried the tunnels beneath the university because he had once been young there and had learned to be lonely in exactly those fluorescent corridors. He had sworn not to return because vows are another kind of hunt for attention, and he went anyway because hunger breaks not just laws but self-respect. The air was not right. It moved in a way that made his darkness let go with tiny reluctant noises even though no one human could hear them. It shifted with the implacability of a schedule. Bead curtains said silly to his eye and then took from him the certainty he had in his own outline. Students walked by with their heads in midterms and their hands on straps of backpacks and he reached for one and his own shadow favored the bead curtain instead and slid along it, furtive and caught, like a lizard on a hot day choosing a line of shade and finding it ambush. He took the stair and the mechanical breath of the building met him in the air at his face and he had the first honest thought he had had in years: I am not wanted here. He had known it before. He felt it now at the level of blood.\n\nWhen Indira\u2019s niece made the poster about conveyances with little drawings of belts and fans and buses and breath, they put it up in the laundromat and in the vestibule at the clinic and at the checkout at Wachowski\u2019s dumplings and in the locker room at the pool where children learned to be fish in water that professionals call too cold and mothers call fine. The poster was not art and was not design; it was instruction wearing its only good clothes. People took pictures of it to send to parents in cities where the dark had found new homes and those parents wrote back with the tone of people who have been thrown a rope and are too proud to say thank you and too human not to mean it. One city added bicycle wheels to the list and strung foil through the spokes and told their couriers and their gig economy and their kids to keep pedaling, keep moving, keep the boundary as river. A woman in a town where the river had been entombed under streets went into the tunnels and stood at a grate and felt the air that had once been water and told the air what she needed from it with the authority of a person who has been told no more times than math should allow.\n\nThere were setbacks and they did not give them headlines because headlines grew the wrong seeds. A basement flooded with ordinary water and the woman who lived there sat on her stairs and cried because she had had enough now of metaphors turning literal. A sprinkler jammed and a boy slipped and his wrist had a story to tell it hadn\u2019t asked for. A vendor at the night market doused a line of foil fish with a hose and sheeted a woman who had not wanted to be wet and the apology was not graceful and the two women did not like each other for a week. The man who had been the center of this learned to come from the side, his favorite trick, and at dawn one morning put lines of not-paint in the place where the path narrows past the canal and three joggers stamped through it and one of them did not notice until she got home because sometimes you do not notice until after and then the fury is for your own attention as much as for the indifference of strangers. The city corrected where it could and learned to say we cannot fix that one and learned to say it with the right amount of regret and no glamour.\n\nThere was talk, again, of names. Journalists like to write referents. Parents of daughters wanted to know what to tell their children to call him so that the danger could be contained by a syllable the way childhood monsters are. Arkady wrote a fragment on Stoneflower and the thread took it and fed it and sent it back undistorted, which doesn\u2019t happen often enough to be taken for granted: call the acts, not the actor. Call the harm, not the man. Call the habit, not the myth. Mr. Winn added for herself: call your friends before you go out at night and tell them which route is the one with the misters and the fans. The radio learned to say incident. The anchors learned to say interruption. The city learned to argue about nothing for a news cycle and then forget in favor of whether the dumpling cart should be moved nearer the entrance. Mr. Winn allowed herself the small luxury of getting bored of the right things.\n\nHe went to a church on a Tuesday afternoon when the light pours through windows only maintenance sees, and he sat in the back where men who do not trust themselves to be seen go. The holy water had become less obliging; the bowl sweated in a way it did not used to, and the priest who wore a collar that had not yet wilted nodded at him without invitation and did not stand on ceremony, which is its own ceremony. He put his hand near the surface and his shadow came off like a coat and tried to lie on the water and the water did not accept the burden, which is perhaps the closest thing to grace the city had witnessed in months. There was silence of a sort that has velocity and he understood without feeling that understanding in his mind that the thing he had loved most about himself\u2014the obedience of his tool, the way it made the world more compliant\u2014had been sold out by an element that had too many birthdays for anyone to count. He pulled back and he left, and the priest added no notch to any weapon and did not count coup and only wrote, on paper older than the computer in his office, a sentence about how the church had done an ordinary thing on a day that had asked for one.\n\nMr. Winn\u2019s heart did its show on a day when the heat had tried to be more interesting than it deserved, and she sat at her window and breathed like she had taught dormitory girls to breathe during exams. Slow in, say hello to the edges. Slower out, tell the body there is more time than it thinks. Indira came without knocking and put a glass of water in her hand and a damp cloth at the back of her neck and did not ask whether she had taken any pills because questions sometimes lie down across the doorway and make what you need to do a step higher. It passed in the way storms pass after scaring you into naming your gods, and when she could count to sixty without losing track she said, \u201cI would like to plant something,\u201d in a tone that startled even her because she had not expected to want anything that large again. They went to the roof because the garden down the block had wait lists longer than desire and because the roof was where buckets collect rain and where women keep bats they are not supposed to have. They put basil into a plastic tub that had once held sports equipment no one needed, and when they watered it they did it with a zeal that would have made a saint blush. The basil did not mind the mixed motives. It took what was offered and tried leaves because trying is what plants do.\n\nHe tried, once, to speak. Not because anything had softened in him or in the city but because the hunger for attention is a sister to the hunger for confession; both are mouths. He stood on a platform not far from where he had once drawn lines on concrete for children to hop and he opened his actual mouth. \u201cYou live like you deserve to,\u201d he said to no one in particular, and then waited for the thrill he had expected to feel in himself and did not. Two teens in the shelter pretended they had not smiled at each other a moment before, and a man with a paper bag of groceries read each of the ingredients on the back of a cereal box because that list demanded more loyalty than a madman\u2019s sermon. He tried again, and he said, \u201cYou make your little lights,\u201d not as a taunt but as a diagnosis, and the words met the hydrophilic film and slid down and pooled on the sill and had the decency to vanish without theater. He did not shout. He did not perform. He left, and the bus came, and the driver lowered the bus and the woman with the walker stepped on without needing anyone to clap.\n\nLenka brought her a book of river names. It had been put from print somewhere in the decade when publishers had forgotten that there was such a thing as quite a lot of people who liked to remember geography for its own sake. They sat with it and an index card and they took turns saying the names out loud and wondering whether their mouths made a kind of river when they did. \u201cOrinoco,\u201d Lenka said, and the O\u2019s made their lips into boats. \u201cSaskatchewan,\u201d Mr. Winn said, and the consonants went on little journeys between teeth. They did not pretend it was medicine. They let it be the comfort it was. Later that night Mr. Winn slept and dreamed a map on which the drop pins were not pins at all but mouths of springs, and when she woke she felt a stupid tenderness for the pipes in the walls. She told the radiator how much she appreciated its civic attitude. She told the sink she valued its valves. She refrained from telling the toilet anything because the toilet had been forced to play too many roles lately and deserved a day free of symbolism.\n\nIt did not end because things do not. There were weeks where the graphs leaned south and weeks where they hesitated at the zero line like swimmers at the end of a lane not sure whether to make the turn or rest a hand on the wall. There were mornings when the radio\u2019s voice had relief braided into it with the traffic and the farm report and there were evenings when a friend texted a photo of a smear near a transit stop and the old thud in Mr. Winn\u2019s chest was both the heart and the dread and the readiness passing a baton. The city forgot in places and remembered in others. A boy grew up. A woman retired from the maintenance crew and went to visit her sister and got off the bus where his shadow had thought it might stage a resurrection and instead found a mister and a volunteer with a bad pun and no blush and she laughed and thought of buying tomatoes she could not afford and bought them anyway. Mr. Winn watered the basil in the morning and poured a line from her thermos in the evening as she walked home, not because she expected to meet a story on the sidewalk but because ritual had taught her that light likes to be shown where to rest. She was not a hero and she did not want to be. She was a person with a list and a thermos and a city that had learned to put its muscles to work again, which, for this chapter, would be enough.",

The radio tried to make a calendar out of it and failed, its voices flattening into a weather that sounded like admonition disguised as forecast. Public Works hung banners on overpasses with the bad fonts of municipal urgency and the good intentions of people who have supervised sewer relines at dawn. Use less, they said, as if thrift were a religion to be practiced suddenly in the face of a bored god. On Stoneflower, a thread that had been about misters and moving curtains grew a second vine alongside it about air, not as metaphor but as medium. They built wind from parts, box fans borrowed from bedrooms, refurbished pedestal fans that remembered the smell of old offices, bicycle wheels that learned to be pinwheels because a boy from a shop on Water Street taught them, and the city grew a quiet machinery that did not want applause. Air moved in doorways, on stair landings, along the mouths of tunnels and in the long throats of corridors, and his black found itself unsettled without anybody having to reach for a tap.\n\nSmoke came from far prairie and from mountains that had never once in their lifetimes asked this town for anything. It arrived at the speed of wind and had none of wind\u2019s humor. It made a new sky over their old one, a bruised tent pinned low. Children learned the language of AQI quickly and earnestly, reciting numbers like points in a game they refused to lose, and put on masks with the ease of new natives to calamity. The night market laid out its foil fish and its misters and then rolled them back halfway because lungs have their own councils where motions are not carried without debate. He liked the smoke because it made the world as he preferred it\u2014less distance, less depth, the edges uncertain the way a liar\u2019s story is, indistinct enough to make a myth feel like a fact. He took the elevated walkway near the mall as his platform not because it was grand but because nobody looks up when their eyes are stung. He pressed two fingers to the glass and encountered the film the city had applied with the quiet tenacity of people who know how to put up bulletin boards straight and level. The smoke condensed on it in tiny beads and ran, the water\u2019s quiet vote cast against him even on a day when taps were discouraged.\n\nMr. Winn learned to put her breath to work as if it were a tool she had inherited and never thought to oil. Lenka showed her the trick at the pool and they took it into the laundromat where practice had made everything honest. They stood two yards from the plexi that protected the bulletin board full of notices that were sentences pretending to be lifelines\u2014my cat, my sublet, my band needs\u2014and they breathed across a small smear that someone had planted there with fingers that liked to think of themselves as instruments. It thinly unmade itself in the time it takes to blow out three birthday candles, which felt like an old rhythm returned for a sensible reason. They taught it at the Hush Walks when the smoke made the city take its quiet more seriously; people stood six feet apart because now they understood that spacing wasn\u2019t a fashion but a way to give air dignity, and when the smear presented itself at a kiosk near the park\u2019s dry fountain, a dozen people leaned forward and breathed like a choir told to favor the outgoing line of the phrase. The black did not enjoy being sung at. It did not know how to survive attention that came as exhale rather than as eyes.\n\nAt the council, the drought brought out men who have always had more opinions than gardens. They spoke about waste in tones usually reserved for scandal, and one of them used the phrase bathers at the public trough with the flourish of a man who has been waiting years to get away with saying it. The woman from Public Works who had teeth that met like careful gears explained graywater again and again until her own mouth wanted washing. Mr. Winn sat with her old jacket pretending to authority and spoke in the clean arithmetic the room couldn\u2019t pretend not to understand. It is volume multiplied by speed, she said, and then gave them the units because men love units when they dislike the conclusions a thing asks of them. It is ounces and seconds and square footage, all obedient when you keep them moving, all rebellious when you try to hoard them. She said fans and foil and breath and belts, and the councilor who had wanted mascots looked like a person who had been forced to learn a mathematics that did not entitle her to applaud herself. Afterward, in the hallway, the Public Works woman put her hand on Mr. Winn\u2019s forearm and said, \u201cI printed your list,\u201d in a voice that had sleep in it and gratitude\u2019s salt at the corners.\n\nHer heart had decided to be less coy with its skipping. Teddy, as the doctor had let it be named, sent notes at inconvenient hours, and one afternoon while the smoke put a stain on the horizon that looked like news she didn\u2019t want, Teddy sat down and refused for eight long seconds to stand. She found the chair by the window the way a swimmer finds the side and she rode out the cold that comes when your blood tries to teach you something. Indira arrived with a glass that was half water, half brothering tone\u2014drink this for me, don\u2019t argue\u2014and sat on the edge of the table watching her friend not die, the deeply practical drama that women conduct in kitchens. When it had passed, when the pencil mountain range the EKG made had finished its brief impression of the Rockies, they let C\u00f4t\u00e9 come up and scold them both with his eyebrows. He pretended to be amused by the bus blanket still on the back of the chair and then failed to pretend, which made him more beautiful than he had ever been. He told a story about his mother and rain. It was almost nothing, and therefore it was the only thing that helped. She had set a coffee tin outside the back door during drought weeks and when rain\u2019s first coins sounded on the tin she had called all her sons and made them listen on purpose. \u201cThis is what mercy sounds like,\u201d she had said to boys who had deserved better than that one lesson and were fortunate to have received it nevertheless.\n\nThe museum that had survived a century by calling its halls rotation and letting the students rearrange its placards invited the city to an exhibit about water with a title that was too clever by half. He could not resist grand old rooms where whispers behave, where the hush has wood behind it and the floors remember being trees. He came with his hum like a mosquito in woodwork and drifted through dioramas where women in aprons pumped plastic handles and men in hats pointed at the river as if only fingers could make it obey. The volunteers had come in their niceness and their refusal to be fooled, and in the bag of one of them lay a sprayer that had been labeled with tape and marker stop for no reason except an old darkroom pun that felt like a cousin to an exorcism. He reached for the display case that held blueprints of the dam, his brush poised to take credit for a thing other men had built. The humidity in the room, managed by machines that had nothing to do with him and everything to do with the swell and shrink of old paper, took his not-paint from the bristles and made it forget, elegantly. It beaded at the joins. It sulked in the seams. The volunteer breathed across it and then sprayed the tiniest of veils, and someone at the far side of the room, a stranger with an ordinary face, began to explain in a quiet voice the difference between preservation and worship and the black left the case because it could not argue with sentences that had that much practice.\n\nThe nights went black not because the stars insisted but because the grid had an opinion about heat no one had thought to ask. The blackout did what blackouts do: made you hear your own appliances grieving their momentary deaths and made you slow your hands until you found every switch by the intimacy of familiarity. In the apartments with their single windows and in the shelters with their breath, people found again the companionship of candles and the ridiculousness of their danger. He liked the power\u2019s absence; he believed it vested him. He stepped into a stairwell at a parking structure and found that stairs generate their own wind when a dozen people move with purpose and forget to pretend they are alone. Foil taped to the landing strings each floor into a small night sky, and the moon, if it had bothered to come, would have been humiliated by how much light it failed to provide. The volunteers had rehearsed rehearsals. They had strings of those cheap LED lights that taste your batteries and won\u2019t let you forget it, and they wore them low, ankle-height, their glow making a river at foot level where his eyes did not want to go. He had brought a flashlight of his own, a fat thing that missionaries used to hand out to children in far away places, and he clicked it on and the light did not love him because light is not obedient when reflected multiplied into a forest of foil. He backed away from the stair\u2019s updraft and tried the elevator and met a sign taped to the door with the good blue painter\u2019s tape\u2014out, honest as breath\u2014and turned to find not a single lens raised in his direction. Indifference stung him better than water ever had.\n\nThere was, one afternoon, a scuffle of the stupid kind that tests a plan. A boy in a sloppy bandanna and exaggerated boots tried to paint the mirror of a nail salon because he had read somewhere that women keep secrets in mirrors and had misunderstood both women and secrets. He found on his first swipe that the black did not stay. The woman with the towel around her shoulders\u2014her hair a bright wet banner that said she had chosen color over weather\u2014reached without ceremony for the bottle she used to spray her plants. She wrote the boy\u2019s face into a water and the boy yelped not out of pain but out of humiliation and she did not prolong it because women have better things to do. The copycat ran, the door chimed in its idiot way, and everyone went back to their stories, and in the lore of a city that learns by repetition and not by decree, the nail salon became a nice paragraph.\n\n\u201cYour granddaughter wants to take your class,\u201d Indira said, always more dangerous than a knock, and Mr. Winn had to sit with the sentence because class is a word that implies desks and chalk and edges that deserve roll call. \u201cWhat does she want to learn,\u201d she asked, startled that her mouth had used the present tense as if she were an institution. \u201cCounting,\u201d Indira said, as if that were an immense act of optimism. They sat with it and did not make it grand. The girl came on a Thursday with a notebook that had been bought with hope, and they put columns on paper again, not the kind that folks with power protect with money, the kind that protect the mind with occupation. What do we do when the water fails us, the header asked, and they put under it things that were not water and a few that were but in different clothes: fans, breath, foil ribbons that made the air larky, a habit of moving slowly enough that a hallway\u2019s draft could be courted. In the next column they wrote what we do for the water that does not fail us, and then they named faucets with addresses, hoses coiled near stairs, buckets set under roof corners for when the gutters sulked. The girl made a third column that neither of them had asked for: who to tell. She listed names and places not to call the press or the police but the people who sweep the stoops and the woman at the pool and the maintenance man whose shirt had a stitched name and a pride that did not wear badly.\n\nHe tried new edges because men such as he always mistake novelty for strategy. The old cinema reopened on a bet with bankruptcy and goodwill and he could not resist its lobby\u2019s cracked tile and the posters that offered women from other decades to this one\u2019s eyes like gifts. He stood under the chandelier, a cheap thing that had learned to pretend it was crystal, and he raised his brush toward a still life of faces set to kiss in a world where nothing went wrong for long. The manager, a young person who wore a ring in their lip like an punctuation mark that meant their own rules, walked up beside him and breathed with a small disdain. The air moved lightly in the lobby because someone had put a fan behind the candy counter where the popcorn machine told its creation myth, and the breeze insisted with a politeness that unstitched the trick he was about to perform. The brush trembled the way it had as a stick in the dirt by the river. He found himself using his mouth. \u201cYou think wind is all it takes,\u201d he said to the manager, and the manager said, \u201cActually, we think organics, mechanicals, and social practice in a careful braid is what it takes,\u201d and then smiled because they had been waiting all evening to say something that nutritious to someone who would not value it, and had said it anyway.\n\nThe drought pinched and the basil on the roof looked at the sun with an expression that could only be read as aside, and Mr. Winn and Indira took to carrying water up the stairs in a way that made them laugh at themselves and at gravity. They put broken tiles under the soil to keep it honest and wrote a note for the other gardeners that said please share the responsibility of thirst. A pigeon that had a sense of humor and no interest in permission came to study the tub and left its contribution on the edge, and they shrugged and thanked it because a city has its own nitrogen cycle. On a night when the smoke parted to let the moon sit closer than usual, the basil flowered, which meant it had decided to spend its remaining days on beauty and not on eating, and Mr. Winn clipped the tops and made a small pile of white and purple stars and thought about seeds as a kind of plan written in patient time.\n\nIn letters that leaned worse now because the typing ribbon in the secondhand shop had given up on its vocation, Lenka wrote about lungs. She had read papers in which words had been set badly to graphs and she had come away with only this worth bringing: breathe when it is hard as if the body is a bellows that has forgotten how to make a flame. Arkady copied the sentence to Stoneflower without attributing it because sometimes anonymity is its own kindness. The Hush Walk that week had a segment of instruction where people stood like foolish reeds and practiced breathing across their own knuckles, then across a square of plexi someone had found behind an art classroom, then toward each other\u2019s shoulders in the careful, permissioned intimacy that you only practice during changed times. The breathing made the city feel like a set of lungs that had decided to make a choir, and in a corner of a video someone had filmed that nobody would post they caught him noticing the ridiculousness and not liking the way it made him feel outdated.\n\nHe broke one rule he had kept: he spoke to a camera. It was on purpose and yet not, because he had mentored himself into believing that attention would come if he called it by name and he did not measure until too late the cost of saying syllables into a lens. He stood in the park at noon and faced a woman who had set her phone on a rail because hands are needed for other things, and he said, \u201cYou are all so busy.\u201d He said it the way a man says a thing at the end of a bar when he has just learned that people have lives without him. She did not look up. The phone kept its dignity. A child on a scooter counts for noise. The hydrophilic film on the transit map nearby shone like nothing special. He waited for his sentence to begin to do its work and when it did not he looked like somebody whose dogs would not come when called and he let his shoulders sag into a posture he had always told himself he had no need of. The woman on the bench returned to her book exactly because it had not asked anything of her, and he felt the smallest scrape of boredom\u2019s knife on the underside of his appetite.\n\nThere was a night when the grid held but the pumps in three buildings did not. The water did not come up. Elevators will tell you that news with their petulant bells, but pipes tell it with a quiet that can be mistaken for peace. Indira knocked on doors because someone had to, and Mr. Winn went floor to floor with a list and a pitcher and the stubbornness of an old woman who knew ten thousand stairs already and had no fear left to spend on three hundred more. C\u00f4t\u00e9 arrived with a case of bottles he had told his lieutenant were for a softball game that would never be played, and together they made a river rise inside a hallway. No miracle attended. Feet hurt. The pitcher slopped. A child who could not sleep watched them from the open mouth of an apartment as if the grown-ups had finally put on the show the child had dreamed of when younger. At the end of the hall a woman stepped carefully over the foolishness of a black line two nights old and Mr. Winn poured a little of her ration along the lip of it without ceremony. It lifted away from the floor like a slug forced to consider it is not the only creature to own slime.\n\nHe tried the wrong kind of river and it startled him. At the roller rink that had been resurrected through a series of prayers printed on grant applications and the bone-will of a woman in neon laces, the floor made everyone move in circles that were not quite circles. He came in with his brush and stood by the edge and considered the physics of centrifugal mean, which had never done him any favor. When he drew his line, the skaters parted around it without touching it because bodies learn spatial negotiation early when wheels are involved, and then they breathed\u2014it was that now, too\u2014and the line went thin and thinner, and a boy in a helmet too large for his head shifted to avoid a girl with a braid longer than nobody\u2019s business, and their draft made a weather he had not planned on. He licked his lip and found that he had tasted dust, not power. He left before his knees betrayed him and the DJ, an auntie with a taste for seventies basslines, let the music rise not because anyone had won but because the song needed to arrive at its chorus.\n\nThere were arguments in the laundromat because nowhere is pure. Someone said it was not their job to keep misters going in this economy. Someone else said that the drops were getting precious in a way that made them itchy. Arkady, arms full of fan blades and wires and the long patience that hides itself under competence, said, \u201cThen we stop, and we see,\u201d and the room recoiled because when you love a ritual you forget sometimes that you can put it down. They stopped for an hour in the university tunnel, an hour where students moved through the air without bead curtains clicking small songs against their shoulders, and he was with his hunger on the stairs when the hour began. He felt a thrill like he had not felt since before the river took him for the first time. He put his hand to the wall. He made his smear. The air was still because they had asked it to be. It did not last on the wall long enough for a story. Students moving have a current even without charms, and their bags made eddies and their breath made a tide, and in eight minutes the smear had become a lesson without teacher. When the hour ended, the thread on Stoneflower that had wanted to be angry chose instead to be smug in the way that helps nothing and hurts nobody, and the argument folded itself and slotted back where it had come from: hunger and fatigue, the two real devils in any civic story.\n\nAutumn had the grace to pretend it was coming even in heat. The night market sold pears that women touched as if checking them for prophecy. The buses ran their knees automatically now, a courtesy upgraded to habit, and drivers had learned to do the motion with their left hand while their right hand did any of the thousand small acts that keep a bus from being a metaphor. Mr. Winn made a will in the lazy way that suggests a person does not intend to use it soon. She wrote down who would have the marbled notebook and who would have the thermos and who would have the basil when it went to seed properly and not in a panic. She did not tell her granddaughter that she had written the girl\u2019s name on the inside cover because names confer obligation and teenagers have their own legislations about that. She put the will under the old cookbook that had been used solely as a trivet and felt the sense of it settle on her chest like a shawl she had not realized she wanted.\n\nHe walked by the dam and imagined again being the river\u2019s editor. He put his fingers on the railing and felt the vibration like the thrum of a drum skin stretched too tight, and his mind went foolish with the fantasy of control. A man with a fishing license and shoulders like history stood twenty feet away and looked at him as if to say: what will you do with that little brush here, friend? He did nothing because men like him always mistake strategy for effect, and strategy requires the kindness of time, which he had spent already. He had begun talking to himself out loud in ways that made the maintenance crews look up from their brooms and then decide, with mercy, not to make faces. He went home to a room with a too-big chair and watched videos he should not, of women being clever with water and foil and breath, and he learned to be resentful of competence, the poorest of man\u2019s hobbies.\n\nThe basil put out seed in a way that asked to be pinched and saved. Mr. Winn and her granddaughter stood in morning light with two envelopes stolen from the desk at the laundromat and the amiable theft felt like a sacrament. They rubbed the dried flowers between their fingers and the seeds fell like punctuation she would later object to if a student had used so many in a sentence. The girl wrote basil, roof, the date, and put the envelope to her nose and said it smelled like what you wish a pantry would smell like in novels. They watered with the last of the dishwater because everyone\u2019s small economies had learned to take pride in being called by their right names. They pressed the envelopes flat and tucked them into the jar where rubber bands go to die and told each other a story about next spring in the way women do when they are deliberately betting against the odds.\n\nAt the clinic the hydrophilic film on the doors had begun to grow a fringe from tiny scratches made by keys and coin edges and the rings of hands that had loved too hard. The maintenance woman took the film off with the tenderness of a nurse and put on a new sheet with a roller that had been designed by someone who loved paint and dressed modestly. Mr. Winn watched her do it and applauded with hunger she refused to call hope, because if hope hears its own name too often it grows vain. The maintenance woman said, \u201cWe do the same amount whether or not anyone notices,\u201d and Mr. Winn felt in her chest the good pain that arrives when someone says simple truth in a voice not interested in audience. They stood together afterward and looked at the glass pretending to be just glass, and both of them saw a kind of parish work where the sacrament is called attention.\n\nHe went to a sports store and bought a black umbrella because his had been taken, and when he opened it in his kitchen he felt theatrical and a little ashamed. He had lost the forest of applause he had once called a day and now he made do with oneself clapping in a kitchen with linoleum that remembered better shoes. He opened the umbrella in the park as a test and a woman in a visor told him he was inviting bad luck with an absentmindedness that felt like medicine in a pill. He walked into a wind that did not have the decency to be visible. The umbrella pulled at his arm like a stubborn pet. He folded it, unwilling to be a threat to no one\u2019s ankles, and stood with his brush and his hum and his appetite and learned that there are days when the city will let you know that you are not required, and that those days are the ones that change a man far away from any camera.\n\nIn the evening, with the heat practicing how to be less rude and the smoke pretending to belong to another continent, Mr. Winn went to the bus stop and poured a thin line along the lip of the shelter because habit is where safety sleeps. She sat and counted buses kneeling, not because anyone had asked her to keep track, but because counting, like watering basil, forces a body to put hope into a sequence. A young man offered to give up his seat and she let him because his courtesy deserved practice. The driver lowered the bus for an invisible person down the block because this too had become ritual. The girl with the sparrow tattoo from the market came by with a mister clipped to her belt like a joke and said hello, Mr., as if the world had always been this ordinary. They talked about tomatoes and about the new drop pins that didn\u2019t gleam but pleased anyway. Across the street the hydrophilic film did its work without anyone narrating it. The wind did what wind does with small bits of foil in a birch. The city moved around its own arteries with unremarkable grace. They had not won. They had continued. They had kept their instruments tuned. They had put their hands to the pumps and to the fans and to their own stubborn hearts and a chapter turned on that motion, as cleanly as a page.",

The air came thin and edged, a blade for heat\u2019s rope, and the smoke that had made the sky its rented room took down its curtains and apologized by way of distance. Leaves crisped to paper and then to lace and then to brown, and sound began to carry again in that mean way it has when the temperature drops\u2014voices crossing streets they couldn\u2019t manage in July, a door closing from half a block away like a punctuation mark louder than the sentence that required it. Mr. Winn listened to the city\u2019s new clarity as if some orchestra had finally stopped tuning and chosen a key, and she found herself hearing the bus\u2019s brakes with respect, the hiss at the end of the exhale being as honest a piece of music as she had ever asked to memorize.\n\nThe grid had sulked long enough that the council tried something that sounded like thrift and turned out to be ritual. They called it a Turn-Down Night and sent mailers with officious clip art asking neighborhoods to dim for two hours, the hour after sundown and the hour before bed, as if darkness were a chore to assign and not a condition to negotiate. Reaction had the cartoon predictability of any city: a man wrote to the paper to say this was civic theater and he did not audition for roles, a child drew a picture of stars and handed it to a librarian who pinned it to a corkboard with quiet ceremony, and volunteers got to work on the thing they always recognize in an announcement\u2014the invitation buried inside a rule. Arkady posted a tone map on Stoneflower, a chart of small noises the city could lean into: fans set to oscillate instead of point, wind chimes made of spoons and Mylar that clicked like shy teeth, bicycle spokes with ribbons that whispered instead of shouted, radiators finally free to sing their winter song and being asked to sing on purpose.\n\nHe liked the thought of lowered lights as if the city were tipping its head for his hand. He polished the ferrule of a new brush with a rag that had once been a shirt someone loved and told himself the argument he always won when no one answered back: that darkness was a solvent and he, the man who could pour it. He studied a map with a finger that pretended it had gentleness and marked with his nail the places where dark pooled even on busy nights\u2014the reading room at the west branch where lamps hung like planets, the memorial grove where names lived in bronze and the trees shushed any person with a thought of cheer. He hummed to test his own mood and heard in it the old complaint that music had failed him. He didn\u2019t consider sound a thing that counted, because he had never had to listen.\n\nThe practice they made for Turn-Down Night began at the laundromat because everything had come to begin there, the hum of machines a forgiving bassline. A young woman whose degree said audio engineering and whose debts said barista brought little speakers the size of apples and set them on washers, and she played the kind of noise that isn\u2019t a song but still feels like a choice. At low frequency the plexi they\u2019d scrounged from behind an art room wrote small circles of condensation as if it were taking notes. They drew a brave, skinny line of his not-paint on the panel and watched it behave. Under certain tones it held itself like a lie that believes its own face; under others it loosened, feathered at the edges the way frost begins to admit it is only water pretending to be geometry. They learned that the hum of the building itself\u2014the elevator\u2019s muscle, the vents\u2019 dry exhale, the old refrigerator\u2019s honesty\u2014made a modest current in air that the black disliked, not dramatical enough to post about but perfect for the stubbornness of living with a problem.\n\nTurn-Down Night came dressed as festivity and stubborn practicality both. Streetlights bowed to half and porches went to lanterns and then to loud scolding by aunties who refused to let children be delighted by fire unsupervised. The bus\u2019s interior lights dimmed to a polite amount and every driver in the city seemed to discover at the same moment that you could lower the bus knee with your foot and let that hiss be a metronome. In doorways hung bead curtains cut from old Mylar blankets that remembered marathons and here did a different kind of endurance. Fans in windows moved air like river wrists. The Hush Walk went out not with foil shining gaudy but with wind-bells made of keys that clicked a domestic holiness across the hands. They added breath to the list of tasks: breathe when the smear appears and breathe together, because exhale without chorus loses half its moral force.\n\nHe tried the memorial grove first because he liked to begin by stealing gravity. The names on the bronze had learned already to resist him; they had been washed so often now with the kind of care that looks like mourning that the black sulked at their edges and slid off in well-trained beads. He pressed the brush to the bench where a woman was peeling an orange for her father, the peel coming away in one elegant helix that suggested competence to the point of art. She did not flinch, not because she was brave but because she heard the key-bells in the path stir, the kind of sound you cannot quite locate, and she felt the smallest wind volunteer its disobedience along her forearm. The black reached without reaching and then stuttered the way a bad idea does when it encounters habit. His hum went to find itself and discovered with an emotion very close to insult that it had competition. From the path a group of teenagers carried their phones in their back pockets instead of their hands and let out a tone under their breath like lawnmowers over a hill, a brown noise that had gotten famous among insomniacs and now was a civic instrument, and on the plexi panel of the bus shelter the smear that had begun to arrange itself found it had no place to gather.\n\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 arrived not with what the papers would call a weapon but with a joystick that controlled the oscillation of a fan he could not have explained to a judge without learning to love metaphor. He let the blade swing, not angrily but insistently, and the air wrote a discipline over the bench and the bronze that the brush could not count on. The church down the block had loaned a pipe from its organ to a child with good lungs and worse homework, and the sound they made when he blew was not reverent but was old, which suited the problem at hand. The black that had loved flat surfaces and single notes found itself being convinced into forgetting. He reached for a mirror mounted on a pole and drew, and the line he dragged behind his bristles tremored, lost track, and slipped as if embarrassed. He did not understand the holds of phase and anti-phase and it did not matter; his shadow learned to dislike being asked to keep time with anything but itself.\n\nMr. Winn walked with the crowd and let the noise wash the old stubbornness in her chest in a way that annoyed her by feeling too much like cure. Teddy made a small poor choice near the lamppost by the drugstore and then apologized, and she kept the breath pattern Lenka had taught her like a chant, two frogs on a summer ditch swapping places. Her granddaughter had one of the apple speakers clipped to her belt and had named the tone she preferred tonic because naming any tool dignifies the hand that wields it. She pressed a button with a thumb whose nail still had a smear of basil dirt at the quick and the sound that came hummed in the key of unremarkable buildings, a comfort noise. When the smear essayed itself onto the transit map like a thesis with too many adverbs, the girl stepped close, told the people near her not to mind, and let the pocket\u2019s noise lie flat against the glass. The black went soft at the middle and then dissolved without drama. The girl lifted her chin and did not look for applause because she had learned from the women who were teaching that competence is dull to any eye not involved.\n\nHe took himself where no rituals had been practiced\u2014he believed\u2014into the new spa with a sign in a too-gentle font that offered sensory deprivation, which seemed to him, in a mood that surprised him by its honesty, like a place that might finally honor him without require an audience. The pods were eggs someone had forgotten to fill with stories, white on white on low whisper. He put his hand on the curve of one, the brush hovering, and his dark went ahead like an earnest scout. Water waited inside, not running, stilled into obedience by salt, and he had the sudden animal memory of the river refusing to admit him. The filter\u2019s small motor made the tiniest of circulations, a current only a tadpole would brag about, and it was enough. The smear he had sent under the lid met that minuscule motion and failed to sit. It made the pod look unwashed but not unholy, and a woman with tired bones who had paid for an hour of quiet came in and saw the mark and went for a cloth with that tiredness born of a thousand small tidies, and she rubbed, humming because she had been taught in kindergarten to sing when you clean. He left angry at the shape of his own want.\n\nLenka wrote on Mr. Winn\u2019s table with letters that would have earned a C for legibility and an A for content if Mr. Winn were still the kind of person who graded papers. Sound is a river if you ask it to be, she typed around the weak ribbon, and she drew in pencil three little waves like a girl making a map for a game. At the bottom she added, in the shame-hand she affected for her big thoughts, he hums in straight lines because he cannot help himself; give him a curve and he will lose his balance. Arkady took the thought and respun it into a guide for buildings, a habit list: let the vents oscillate, not fixed; run the fans with a sway; schedule the compressors for off-beats if the budget allows; ask janitors to stop halfway down a hall and then go back the other way for no reason they need explain to anyone. The note to the janitors went up on corkboards in break rooms like a promise no one wanted to admit they needed.\n\nOn buses, the kneeling hiss became a kind of call and response, drivers trading jokes about timing while their feet learned a choreography that let machines and people practice being gentle together. Museums leaned their humidity higher for paper and the added air moved grievances off glass in the manner of a polite usher. The nail salon put a playlist on that was mostly fans in different rooms and the women in the chairs laughed with a relief that should not have felt radical. The roller rink DJ discovered a track that was nothing but a subway car recorded from the end of the last car, a steady new river, and whenever she played it the black on the corners of mirrors sighed and forgot its shape. This did not make a headline and no one\u2019s grant proposal got easier to write, but the city\u2019s shoulders went down another inch and stayed there, a measure you could see only if you loved measurement for reasons that were not power.\n\nNoise complaints filed in the week after the Turn-Down rose and fell like the stock market and the men who tally such things tried to find in the data a righteousness they could wear to a meeting. A baby down the hall from Indira discovered that crying into the foil curtain by the elevator made a sound that brought adults at speed, and the household kept the curtain there for a day longer than they needed to because you do not argue with a toddler whose experiment has worked. In the library the new maintenance man put the fans on too high and papers tried to animate themselves off tables, and in the fine for blowing on books column of crime and punishment, he earned a warning and then a pie someone had baked because the building had more gratitude than rules. They tuned and detuned and tuned again, less a policy than a musician\u2019s grunt work.\n\nIn the marbled notebook, Mr. Winn wrote phase and then, because she could not help herself, drew a little sketch of two waves that met and made a straight line where a mess might have been, and she felt a smugness she would not confess to traffic reporters or to saints. She wrote: we starved him of stillness, which had the virtue of being truth and the limitation of being only partial. Under it she wrote: other hungers will find him. He will try to stand where nothing moves\u2014fever, snow, words. She wrote: words move if you make them, and she looked at the page until the line turned into a field and then into a feathering she wanted to call frost and did not, because metaphor had been overworked this year and deserved a nap.\n\nHe went out past the last bus to the place where the forest pretended it had not heard of cities and put his hand on the bark of a pine he would never bother to name. The wind there said ocean without water, a language made of small noises en masse, and he felt his dark slip as if embarrassed to be the only thing holding still. Needles shivered and the sky between gave him a litter of pieces he could not assemble into a wall. He walked a path the color of argument and the sound of his own foot on duff made a music he had always despised, and he did nothing, which was new as a skill. He came back smaller not because anyone took anything from him but because scale is a function of frame and the frame had shifted in ways he did not know how to narrate to himself without breaking.\n\nBulbs went into rooftop tubs with the solemnity of translating something ancient. They planted tulips and then decided on daffodils because daffodils forgive more. Indira and Mr. Winn dug with spoons because the trowel had gone on walkabout and returned as a superhero cape for a doll downstairs and they refused to fight that rescue mission with an adult\u2019s need to own. They tucked the papery bulbs into that mix of dirt and old coffee that every city gardener eventually perfects, and they talked about the way sound had felt as a tool the night before, not as victory but as rehearsal. They watered with brown water that had washed hands and then forgotten that it had, and to the little bump of earth where a tulip slept they told the story of a bus kneeling as a kind of lullaby.\n\nAt the pool the audio engineer and Arkady and four kids who had spent their childhoods making phones serve as drums set up a speaker low enough to be mistaken for negligence and curled the sound around the water like a ribbon and watched the surface write commas. They drew a line on plexi again, because tests require repetition to admit to themselves that they are not lucky, and let a tone that tasted like rain in a parking garage ask the black to un-tell its own story. It did, grudgingly. One of the kids asked whether laughter counted as noise and the audio engineer told him yes and the pool echoed yes yes until they had to fetch the whistle because joy, too, needs shepherding when it\u2019s near water.\n\nHe made himself speak again, poorly. He had never been a man who kept diaries because diaries do not clap, and the phone in his hand became a confession booth without priest. He said into the lens, \u201cYou make a trick out of motion,\u201d and the phone did not argue and did not agree and did not go out of its way to find him an audience. The algorithm did not love him like he believed it should. The comments he read later were tired and practical, women trading fan settings and telling each other which sound machines broke after two months and which ones lasted, and he felt, for the first time perhaps in a life that had had plenty of opportunity for the feeling, truly irrelevant. He mistook that poverty for injustice.\n\nWhen the pumps in the three oldest buildings decided to take the same day off\u2014perhaps in a solidarity learned in pipes that shook toward each other through soil\u2014Mr. Winn and Indira and a boy who had found the trowel ribbon in the pocket of his hoodie moved water without believing it made them saints. C\u00f4t\u00e9 drove a boxy city van badly up a narrow lane because permission did not come with skill, and he and two other men who had expected their hands to write tickets and not carry cases of bottles invented a relay that did not require applause. At the end of the corridor that smelled of institutions and dinners, someone had drawn a line two nights ago and a woman who carried a baby the fussy size of a loaf of bread took a patience she could not afford and poured a streak of her ration along it as if drawing a line between mischief and home. It lifted, shame-faced. She went on.\n\nHe tried snow when it came, because snow is a pause with edges, and he liked edges. He pressed the brush to the plexi of a bus shelter grown brittle with cold. The line he drew tried to be himself and then fell onto the snow on the sill and made a dull collusion with white that read as stain and not as doctrine. A volunteer in a hat long enough to be described, in older novels, as knitted with love, breathed, and the breath fogged and then fell as tiny rivulets of perfectly ordinary wet. The smear unmade itself with a laziness that felt like cruelty. He laughed in a way that broke something inside whatever the black used for pride.\n\nAt the council chamber with its flags that had never learned to drape with grace, they argued about noise in a way that would have made summer Mr. Winn impatient and now only tickled her in the way of small absurdities. The first-to-know councilor floated the idea of appointing a Director of Sound and was surprised when the room did not mock her. The Public Works woman said, \u201cWe already have one; it is the wind,\u201d and then, because she had learned to dress the truth in a blazer, added, \u201cand also my department, on Thursdays,\u201d and they laughed with their shoulders and then wrote a line into a document that would outlast any of them and it said more or less: buildings will be invited to move air. It was an invitation like many the city had grown good at writing\u2014it sounded soft until you felt the hand behind it.\n\nMr. Winn went home and made tea and forgot the kettle on and remembered it in time and wrote in the marbled book the sentences she allowed herself when the city had pleased her and, in pleasing, made her suspicious. She wrote: do not love your tools so much you forget to put them down. She wrote: when he stops moving, do not write a ballad. She wrote: practice is the only magic we are allowed. Teddy made a little jump in agreement or disapproval; it was hard to tell. The basil on the sill gave up at last, its leaves despairing of pretending to be green, and she cut what could be cut and dried it on a plate she had saved from the old country\u2019s thrift store because being poor at the right time is how you end a day.\n\nHe stood at the window of his room in a building that had pretended to be fashionable and failed and watched a bus lower for an empty stop and he did not sneer. He did not admire, either; he was not ready for that. Down the block a woman shook out a cloth and the cloth made a wave of air the size of her kitchen and the black in the corner of the window frame retreated without narrative. He felt anger in his knees the way men do when they are slowly being asked to learn they are not the protagonist, and he put his brush in a jar and for a second made the mistake of thinking that a gesture is a choice. The jar was clean. The brush stayed a brush. The city moved around him with a competence that did not ask permission. The Turn-Down ended without anyone besides the council and a few poets noting it, and the lights went back up to their small arrogant levels, and the fans kept moving because motion, once it is learned, is reluctant to forget itself.",

The river put on a sheet in places where it was shallow, a brittle pretense, and kept its muscle where depth made stubbornness academic. The air sharpened into the kind of attention that never suits liars, and sounds travelled as if hired for the job\u2014skate blades farther along the path than you could account for, the far-off drill that Public Works wielded against a bolt which had decided it was married. Mr. Winn learned the creaks in her building again, winter\u2019s specific chorus, and found that the radiator\u2019s song had a kindness in it she had failed to recognize as a child. It was not music, not really; it was function so steadfast that it bothered to be audible.\n\nStoneflower wrote in threads not of panic but of phase, a handful of physicists with kindness in their fonts explaining how water, obedient mostly to heat, could be coaxed into disobedience by motion even when the calendar tried to fix it. A woman from the parks department with calves like the roots of a tree posted photographs of bubblers the city had forgotten it owned, little machines meant for ornamental ponds now reinterpreted as river breath. Volunteers borrowed the word aeration and made it a civic endearment. They asked the fountain that had spat half-hearted rainbows in the plaza all summer to use its lungs to keep the underpass from glazing into something his not-paint would love. A man with a plow route longer than some family trees found himself consenting to drag a chain behind the truck just to scratch the ice into a thousand lines, which is another way of saying he had been taught to make surface unconfident.\n\nHe went for ice with the stubborn curiosity of someone who has had a favorite table taken away and must discover whether the new one will hold his elbows. At the river\u2019s edge where the water had decided to pretend it was floor, he pressed the brush and watched the black scud across slickness and try to be a face. The cold did not respect his appetite. It seized the skin of the stain at the edges and made it look like a bruise pretending to be architecture. A child in a too-big parka with pompoms like modest planets skated close, mother at a distance, and her blades made their own sound like careful tearing, and the black tremored wherever she passed as if the idea of glide had embarrassed it. He tried to write longer and the city\u2019s small interventions, salt and grit and chain scratches and a bubbler twenty feet downstream pushing its insistence through the field, turned his line into confetti that could not decide whether it wanted to be ink or ash.\n\nIn Mr. Winn\u2019s kitchen, Teddy chose to send stern notes at inconvenient hours and had to be answered with breath and patience and Indira\u2019s hands with their small, competent heat. The granddaughter learned the inventory of pills and the inventory of jokes that worked no matter how scared a room became, and she practiced not overperforming either. They set up new rituals alongside the old ones: a check of the misters\u2019 hoses coiled for spring, a glance at the fan in the hallway to ensure oscillation did not die under the weight of laziness, a tally kept in the marbled book of days when she could make it to the bus stop and pour a thin line and days when the window must be her observation deck. She told herself boredom was still a weapon and that it had to be shared to be sharp.\n\nThe reading room at West Branch put out an advisory in the plainest tone it had: please do not breathe on the vellum. They turned the pages anyway, librarians with the good hands, and found they had built a weather that defended memory. He entered with his hum down low and the dark sitting like a folded coat around him and aimed at a display case so proud of its carefulness it had grown humble. The case, as it turned out, was an instrument too; its microclimate put a slow circulation on the air that lifted a smear\u2019s edges and weathered it into an accident. Librarians became ornithologists of smudge and learned to identify the species at a glance. They set the humidifiers not at stasis but at a practiced sway and forced his certainty to try to find purchase on a surface writing its own small poem of ebb and return. A page turned across the room made a draft that was not drama but was doctrine, and the black retreated, offended without admitting to offense because it preferred to think of its sensitivities as power.\n\nThe city rediscovered readings as if someone had thrown a cue. Not the sponsored kind with wine in plastic cups and jackets that needed tending; the stubborn kind in laundromats and bus depots and clinic vestibules, where grandparents took turns making words into weather for children who had forgotten their scarves. They learned to read out loud not because it made anyone clever but because it moved the air where breath sometimes failed to collect. Lines of poetry, yes, when somebody wanted to be tender, but grocery lists too, a woman reciting in bored reverence the inventory she had to face and letting that cadence set up a current in the hallway. Students stood in a circle under bead curtains and chanted multiplication tables as if they were invoking something older than numbers, and the smear on the wall behind them relented despondently in the face of rhythm. A man with a bad day read his appliance manual for a toaster over the heads of strangers waiting for a bus and the laugh that went through the shelter did exactly what was required.\n\nAt the dam the bubbler team learned to ask for overtime without apology and Public Works discovered it could borrow parts from places the budget had not thought to categorize as cousins. The men who had names stitched in blue on their shirts became heroes by refusing the word and showing up with tools that clicked and whined and turned deep water from a mirror into an argument. A heron watched from a sill of ice with the professional resignation of a bird that knows it has outlived fashions. He came to the wall and counted bolts like prayers he never liked and told himself a story about leverage that admitted no mathematicians. He pressed the brush to the railing as if to sign it and discovered that the salt that kept human feet honest had left a wet that would not keep secrets, and the line he drew forgot itself on contact with the film only City Hall would ever learn the procurement number for. He withdrew with dignity and that, perhaps, was the beginning of a new humiliation for him; he could not even give himself to fury with any hope of applause to make it worth the cost.\n\nLenka made soup and called it conveyance because nothing else that day had gone where it should. She carried the pot across a hallway to Mr. Winn\u2019s door, dish towel wrapped in that particular grandma architecture that prevents burns but looks like ritual. They ate and let steam be a tool, lids lifted and replaced until the windows remembered what winter does to glass, and afterward she typed poorly about betrayals she had seen in other towns where men of a similar appetite had tried to turn stillness into territory. In the margin she penciled a note because the ribbon had finally cracked itself into silence: steam carries; enlist it when you can. The laundromat took the sentence literally and put a kettle behind the coin machine to warm the room\u2019s air in enough cycles that fog became ordinance.\n\nHe tried the subway, in the hour when trains ran like promises kept grudgingly, and put his hand out into the piston wind that tunnels generate for free. He had always held contempt for the kind of movement that does not originate in a human hand and here found himself, to his surprise, resentful of steel. The smear he sent ahead of himself made it three feet before the gust ran its fingers through it and unmade it into suggestion. Students, noses pink with cold above their masks, did not offer him a glance. A busker at the turnstile played the same three bars on a violin with a determination that would have made saints rueful, and the ruins of his line on a tile wall adopted the rhythm against their will until they were more accompaniment than inscription.\n\nScreens, which he had scorned because they belong to a species of attention that refuses to be shared with anything but itself, betrayed him with updates. The e-ink timetables in the transit shelters refreshed in that little shiver you have to look for deliberately, and his not-paint could not keep its grip on a surface that insisted on the small polite chaos of changing digits. He tried his line down the edge where the advertisement had been put under glass no thicker than a fingernail, and the hydrophilic film lifted water from air to meet him with a thin slick handshake that left him feeling like a man who has been given a pamphlet when he had demanded a sword. His hum rose in irritation and was met by a child practicing a recorder wrong on purpose, and for the first time he considered taking offense at a note.\n\nTurn-Down became Turn-Over became habit. They made schedules for the oscillations of air instead of for the delivery of spectacle, and the flyers that went out to building supers had diagrams that looked like dances drawn by a careful hand that did not like to admit to art. The Office of Motion\u2014the joke title the Public Works woman had put on a note as sarcasm and then stamped on a memo as if that had been the plan all along\u2014started to send bulletins written in the voice of an aunt: do not forget to let your fans rest between stretches, darlings, because machines have the tempers of middle children. Mr. Winn saved those notices with the reverence she reserved for recipes written in other women\u2019s hands and taped them inside a cupboard door she opened twice a day because ritual improves if it is near flour.\n\nThere were setbacks of the small, true sort, the kind a novelist would remove for cleanliness and a city must keep to avoid myth. A volunteer slipped on the thin film that comes when ambition meets a cheap mop and sprained an already tired ankle. A bubbler seized and coughed oil like a gossip and had to be taken apart on a night cold enough to make men swear in languages they didn\u2019t know they knew. A man whose temperament tended toward argument took a fan\u2019s oscillation as an insult and calmed down only when the custodian let him put a hand on the grille to feel the reality of appliance instead of the suspicion of plan. A teen with a bright appetite for drama filmed himself trying to make the black hold on a frosted window and got three likes and a text from a girl who told him he was being predictable and he went to the rink instead. The obituary column in the paper\u2014the column no one wants and everyone requires\u2014made a small lean toward the ordinary that winter, and the city let itself be grateful without sending a self-congratulatory note to itself.\n\nOn the roof the basil had given up and the bulbs slept in their paper coats, and the two women who had planted them tried not to look like people at a bedside. They shook dry seed into envelopes and dated them as if spring could be called to attention by a stamp. Mr. Winn told the story of her father\u2019s hands again, because repetition is one of age\u2019s rewards, and the granddaughter asked for it in the way of teenagers who pretend that they are submitting more than requesting. She made tea and got the water just short of boiling because herbs are snobs, and when they drank it it tasted like the shadow of a summer in a city that had had to relearn every choreography it thought had gone out of fashion.\n\nHe went back to the river not because he had any hope of conquering it but because misery, like worship, is repetitive. He walked to the place where the ice showed off in a lilac that would have delighted him if he had had room in his attention for any color but his own, and he put the brush in the pocket of his coat and did not take it out. The fog lifted in a single line from a breathe-hole where the bubbler worked and he stepped into it by accident, a joke written by physics and not by anyone\u2019s agenda. His coat gathered damp and his shadow, which had always believed itself exempt, recoiled with the skittishness of a horse surprised by its own reflection. He stood a long time and the only witness was a woman he did not see who had come with a thermos to practice her own ritual, and she poured a thin line along the lip of the path and did not look at him because withholding that last dignity had become a civic sport.\n\nThe council posed for a photograph none of them would print, a group of people with their faces in honest winter disarray standing in front of a box of fans and a spool of Mylar and a crate of replacement humidifier filters that held the true glamour of any season. They passed a resolution no one would call a law because the word law makes people stand up straighter than necessary: buildings, public and private, are requested to move air. The city clerk wrote it into language that would not be laughed at by anyone who counts commas, and the maintenance crews nodded because it meant someone had noticed their empire. The marketing firm tried to design a poster declaring Sound Saves and Arkady wrote a note that said, as gently as she knew how, please stop giving us slogans; we have enough to hold in our mouths.\n\nMr. Winn found herself saving ridiculous things that winter\u2014rubber bands with their bloom of starch, the twist tie from bread, the label peeled off a jar because the glue was obedient and it felt like disloyalty to throw away any honest labor. Her heart behaved itself more often than she had any right to expect, and when it did not, the drills of breath and quiet and practiced boredom did what drills do: they made a skill out of panic\u2019s bad impulse. She wrote in the marbled book sentences she would have dismissed as trite in a classroom and found them to be, in a kitchen, exact. You can be tired and still be useful. You can be afraid and still be courteous. You can be unimportant and still be necessary. Indira found the book open one afternoon and added in her own hand, slanted and decisive, you can be wrong and try again without ceremony.\n\nThe man whose darkness had learned reluctance took a bus one afternoon not because he had chosen humility but because the car he had counted on was sulking under a thin coat of ice that made tires into advice nobody wanted. He sat two rows back and watched the driver work the knee of the machine for an old man carrying celery and for a girl with a backpack that made the alphabet look newly minted, and in the rhythm of the bus he felt something he did not have a name for because the names available to him had been stolen by people he had refused to watch. The hydrophilic film on the glass behind the ad that showed a woman with a hammer and a smile was scratched but useful, and the little bead chain on the stop request bell knocked a rhythm against the pole that made the shadow at his heel jitter into a species of shyness. He got off not because it was his stop but because the bus had made itself into a room that did not need him.\n\nThere was a night colder than the year deserved, and the fans stuttered in their bearings and the bubbler complained like an old man, and the people who had made a habit out of mercy did what habits are for and did not abandon their post. A boy with bad gloves took the midnight shift at the rink because the generator needed to be fed and the fog had to be kept from lying down flat, and he sang to himself without knowing the building could hear him and approve. A woman on the hospital\u2019s third floor who had spent her career mending the small holes left by the city in the bodies of its citizens watched the hydrophilic film carry the smallest of beads along its face and thought, ungodly for a minute, that if there were a god this might be how grace chose to move.\n\nWhen spring\u2019s first rumor came not in bud but in smell\u2014a sour wet at the seams of the sidewalks where snow had hunkered and homesickness had gone to winter\u2014the city had enough practice not to mistake rumor for arrival. The bulbs in the roof tubs did the math on light and decided to be patient, and the basil envelope stayed in the jar as if a seed can tell time by paper. He went looking for a new surface with a man\u2019s temper for having to adapt and found none that would restore him to the scale he had once bullied the city into granting. He stood at a bus shelter and watched a volunteer wipe, not in circles, but in lines taught by the Office of Motion, because circles coddle a smear and lines make it travel, and he felt not hatred but the pettier thing that rots quicker: envy of competence.\n\nOn an evening when the sky had the clean marrow-blue of polite cold and Mr. Winn counted the kneels at the stop without the craving to make the number round off into a legend, a woman in a visor who had scolded him for opening an umbrella in a park months ago came to sit and said nothing and then said, after two stops had gone by, that her boy slept better to brown noise and she had bought a machine that did the job well. Mr. Winn told her she was an engineer whether or not anyone had hired her. The hydrophilic film did its quiet trick one more time on an attempt that would not be broadcast because the city had finally gotten good at starve. The keys in the bead curtain at the laundromat clicked a note that had become a civic pitch. The river, under ice in places and not in others, remembered what water is and refused to be hired by anybody\u2019s story. They sat and let the bus make its kneeling music and counted only for themselves, because a ritual without a congregation is sometimes the clearest kind.",
