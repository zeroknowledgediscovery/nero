     "novel_text": "He woke to the sound of the downtown street cleaner groaning along 300 South, the bristles flirting with grit and old glass. Salt in the air like coins licked and passed around. Benjamin lay there listening, as if the machine had come specifically for him, to rub him down to something shining. The blinds rattled. The light was the soft grey of an inversion and the Wasatch were a shape more remembered than seen from his window. He put the heel of his hand to his eye and pressed. Another day.\n\nOn the walk to the bank he caught a whiff of the Great Salt Lake\u2014metallic, a ghost of brine shrimp\u2014and watched gulls squabble on the lip of a trash can near City Creek, their quarrels a quick slapstick he always pretended held meaning. Temple Square\u2019s granite looked clean as paper behind glass. Once, every other sidewalk conversation he overheard used the soft words he grew up on, the ones that tucked him in at night, a family of nouns and verbs all about building, about eternity, about neatness. Now it was start-ups, skiing, outrage over zoning laws, meat-heavy brunches. He adjusted his tie and tried to match his pace to a man in a Lululemon jacket, then let him go.\n\nHe was thirty-five and wore the confidence of a banker like an afterthought, which in some ways it was. He worked in the corporate lending division on the seventh floor of a building that promised respectability and delivered views of the Oquirrhs. Numbers behaved for him; they lined up and became obedient. He liked the balance of a loan package that showed its own logic, that gave itself away. But at his desk, his cursor sometimes blinked like a heartbeat too fast, like a child told to sit still. He would look up and not see anything, only his reflection in the glass, his own face making a faint motion\u2014chewing?\u2014while the city moved on without him.\n\nAt noon he ate a turkey sandwich alone in the little park near Gallivan, listening to a busker with chapped fingers pick an angry melody and still call every passerby \u201csir\u201d or \u201cma\u2019am.\u201d He bit into the bread, dry that day, and wondered why he had never learned Spanish properly when half his clients\u2019 workers were talking it over the loading docks, when the best tacos in town were easier to reach than a belief. He had taken two semesters in college, if you could call the first semester \u201cattendance\u201d and the second \u201cflirtation with a girl named Kimberly who kissed him once in the back of a linguistics lecture and then married a dentist.\u201d He used to think his failure to become bilingual was a charming flaw, an imperfection that marked his normality and kept him from something sharper, but lately he was tired of being charmed by his own deficiencies. He wanted to enter a warehouse and greet a man rolling a pallet jack with something other than the short, humiliating nod of an uninvited guest.\n\nHe tore a small square from the city\u2019s weekly paper to have something to fold and unfold, a nervous tick too humble even to admit itself. On the back of an advertisement for an improv theatre workshop was a four-by-four box with a simple line of type: Spanish Tutoring and Conversation. Patient, culturally minded, sliding scale. Mara. A number. He folded the paper into a turret and put it in his pocket and that night, after left-overs and a late run to the post box on 2nd Ave, he dialed the number and then hung up twice before he let it ring.\n\nHer voice came quick and light, as if she had been moving around the room when she answered. It had a shape like smiling does. \u201cHola,\u201d she said, then switched, \u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d he said too loudly. He cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m calling about the tutoring.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d she said, the word warm. He imagined her leaning over a small desk, a notebook open, sunlight on her wrist. \u201cOkay. Great. What do you\u2014how much do you already know?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery little. Less than\u2026 less than you might hope,\u201d he said, and then tried not to add a self-deprecating laugh to fill what felt like a gap. He failed; he laughed anyway, a short bark that sounded like his father catching a fish.\n\n\u201cWe start where we are,\u201d she said, without any performance in it, like a simple rule. \u201cWhere are you? Do you know present tense? Do you know how to say your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cMe llamo Benjamin,\u201d he said, amazed his tongue remembered anything at all. The presence of his name in another language felt like a secret him he had misplaced somewhere.\n\n\u201cMucho gusto, Benjamin. Soy Mara. Do you want conversation, grammar, reading? Do you have reasons?\u201d Her voice barely turned reasons into a question; it sounded more like an invitation to talk.\n\n\u201cI\u2014work. Work reasons. And because I don\u2019t want to be an idiot for the rest of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd because\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to say the kinds of things I want to say.\u201d\n\nShe paused, and he realized he\u2019d provided too much. \u201cWe\u2019ll find them,\u201d she said, not unkind. \u201cWhere do you want to meet?\u201d\n\n\u201cWherever you teach. A coffee shop? Is that okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe library is good,\u201d she said. \u201cThe big one on 210 East. The caf\u00e9 there is quiet and they don\u2019t mind us taking up space. Or\u2014I have a small place, but I think for the first time, the library. Tomorrow at six? Or too fast?\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow at six,\u201d he said, and it was only after he hung up that he felt the unsteady rush in his chest, a feeling like stepping onto a moving walkway that was faster than it first looked. He wrote her name on the torn piece of paper and set it on the counter, as if it were something that might need to be admired by a passerby.\n\nThe City Library\u2019s glass tilted like a sail and made its own weather inside. He arrived ten minutes early and pretended to look for a book but stood in front of the New Fiction display reading the back of a paperback about a whale and trying to understand whether the author was being ironic in his gratitude. At the caf\u00e9 he took a corner table and looked into the square. A group of teenagers took photographs of each other in front of the public art. A woman in a bright coat spoke sharply to a man who had stopped beside her with a grin already trying itself on. Benjamin\u2019s hands went cold the way they did before any meeting that mattered.\n\nShe came in without looking around for him, which made him study her all the harder before she found him. She was shorter than his mind had made her, hair pulled into a hasty twist that left wisps at her temples. A blue sweater the color of an inland lake. Jeans with a paint stain on the back of the left thigh that would have been contrived on an expensive pair. When her eyes fell on him she smiled in a way that made him think she would have smiled just as genuinely at anyone else. It might have been a trick; it wasn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cBenjamin?\u201d she said with a question in it, even though they both knew the answer. He stood too fast and knocked his knee against the table so his coffee trembled awake.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cSorry, I\u2014please\u2014hi.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d she said. \u201cMara.\u201d She put her bag on a chair and sat. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do any of the thing where you tell me you\u2019re bad at this. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re good at many things and bad at some others and I am too. Today we can learn how to say \u2018I am buying fruit\u2019 or something thrilling like that.\u201d\n\nHe laughed before he could help it. \u201cThat sounds thrilling,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean it.\u201d\n\nShe took out a small notebook and a pen. No laptop, no stack of worksheets with a logo. \u201cWe start with you. Who are you? She touched her pen to the page. \u201cWho do you talk to? What do you want to say by next week, not next year?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a banker,\u201d he said. \u201cI came up with a list of things to tell you about myself and they\u2019re all boring. I\u2019m from here. I swim at Steiner when I\u2019m pretending I don\u2019t hate exercise. I make abysmal scrambled eggs. I used to go to church before it stopped feeling like church.\u201d\n\nShe nodded, wrote banker in a slow, careful way, even though it was a simple word and she knew it. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cBanker. Want to say to your clients, to workers, to\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cWorkers,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd friends. Future friends.\u201d He surprised himself again with that last part and felt, for a second, sixteen.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, and pointed at him with her pen as if to bless this plan. \u201cSpanish is full of ways to avoid saying anything directly, which is useful, and it\u2019s full of ways to be very direct, which is also useful. We\u2019ll do both. Ready?\u201d Without waiting, she began, gentle and relentless, the way a stream works on stone. He repeated after her, stumbling, and then again without stumbling; she corrected him without letting him drown in his own apology. At one point he said \u201cembarazado\u201d when he meant \u201cembarrassed\u201d and she lifted a hand, smiled, and said, careful. \u201cEmbarrassed is \u2018avergonzado.\u2019 Embrazado is something else. Unless there\u2019s something you want to tell me.\u201d\n\nHis cheeks went hot and he made the laugh he had already started to hate, and she let him off the hook by telling him how in Spanish you didn\u2019t say \u201cI am cold\u201d but \u201cI have cold,\u201d and how in her grandmother\u2019s house the phrase was half prayer, tengo fr\u00edo, mija, and someone would put a towel in the dryer and wrap you while it was still warm. He imagined her grandmother\u2019s hands and felt for a moment like all of this was not language but a way into something that had been happening all around him, always, without him being invited to look.\n\n\u201cFor homework,\u201d she said at the end of an hour that had passed faster than an hour had any right to, \u201cI want you to listen. No apps yet. Just listen. Go to Rancho Market and buy oranges in the afternoon and stand in line and listen to what the person in front of you calls the cashier. Go to Red Iguana if you want to be surrounded by a thousand people who can\u2019t get enough of mole and just listen to how the servers take patience and make it into a tool. And we\u2019ll read something too, because reading is like lifting small weights over and over until a door opens without squeaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do we read?\u201d he said. He wanted to impress her, but he did not know any writers whose names wouldn\u2019t embarrass both of them.\n\n\u201cI brought you this,\u201d she said, taking a slim book from her bag. The cover was blue and a little worn at the edges. \u201cSor Juana. We can read her slower than anyone has ever read her and it will still be too fast. This one and some Neruda. And this.\u201d She slid him a photocopy of a poem by a poet whose name he could not pronounce. \u201cFor when you have energy. But don\u2019t force it. The mouth learns first.\u201d\n\nHe held the book like it had warmth in it. \u201cHow much do I pay you?\u201d he said, suddenly remembering he had not asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sliding,\u201d she said, looking at him as if to say she knew, approximately, which end of the slide he would be on. \u201cWhat can you pay?\u201d\n\n\u201cEighty,\u201d he said, picking a number on the safe side of generous.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d she said, and he saw the momentary almost, the tiny calculation, as if she was measuring grocery lists against hours. \u201cSixty is also fine. This is not\u2014\u201d She paused, hunting for a word she wanted. \u201cWe\u2019re not negotiating across a table.\u201d\n\n\u201cEighty,\u201d he said, wanting not to be cheap and not to be theatrical about not being cheap. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. She wrote down her Venmo. Her writing had a clarity, a gate that was open and careful. \u201cWe\u2019ll do Tuesdays, if that works. At six. And text me if anything changes.\u201d\n\nHe walked out into the early evening with the book beneath his arm like a report that had just cleared compliance, both the same and not even a little. The sky had decided not to produce a sunset and so there was only the one color, a soft lid over everything. He went home and cooked asparagus poorly and then read the first lines of the Sor Juana aloud to his sink, and then again until the vowels stopped acting like the enemy, until he could taste something in them.\n\nHis parents\u2019 house was in Bountiful; it took him exactly nineteen minutes to \u201cdrop by\u201d when dropping by sounded to him like an obligation with frosting. He called his mother that Sunday and she talked about the stake potluck, who had moved (the Brinkleys) and who had returned (nobody, she said in that tone that meant everybody), and then about the temple wedding she had gone to a week before. He let the words drift\u2014so many capitals\u2014until she asked casually, like a fisherman would of a lake he had known since boyhood, \u201cAre you seeing anyone, Benji?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m learning Spanish,\u201d he said, which was also an answer, in a way.\n\n\u201cThat sounds good,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the mission you should have gone on,\u201d and then they both fell silent, not because it was awkward exactly but because there is a kind of quiet that arrives when both parties are looking at slightly different calendars at the same time.\n\nOn Tuesday he brought Mara a coffee that he hoped she liked. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask if you drank coffee,\u201d he said, too late to change it to tea.\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mother already lit a candle for me about it. No wait, that was for driving in the snow. But coffee is in there somewhere.\u201d Her smile was quick. \u201cGracias.\u201d She drank and then wrinkled her nose like a cat. \u201cIt\u2019s a little burnt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey told me it was good,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey always tell you that,\u201d she said.\n\nThey sat at the library again, and then the next week and the next. He met Mara in his sentences first, in the way she would lean toward him without making a performance of it when his mouth was working around a word like \u201cpuente,\u201d and then lean back when he got it right, as if she were unwilling to make triumph into anything other than a shared fact. He noticed her soft freckles, the way she held a pen like a baton, ready to conduct. To himself, he admitted he liked the way she made nouns look like verbs, young as she was and already teaching him how to build a room around a verb. He did not know how old she was until she mentioned her sister\u2019s seventeen-year-old car that only went uphill if coaxed, and he asked, and she said she was twenty-seven, and he felt both too old and exactly right.\n\n\u201cDo you always do this?\u201d he asked her one day, when they were packaging \u201cgustar\u201d into something that would not make him weep. \u201cTutor adults who think they\u2019re already seaworthy?\u201d\n\n\u201cI tutor anyone who wants to learn,\u201d she said. Then she set the pen down and let it spin in a small orbit where their wrists had been nearly touching. \u201cMostly I work with kids. The after-school program in Rose Park. But adults are refreshing. You come with your own mistakes. Kids come with other people\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long have you been doing it?\u201d\n\n\u201cSince high school, really. I used to help my dad with his English assignments, even though I didn\u2019t know English then either. Which is to say,\u201d she smiled, \u201cwe both got a little fluent in pretending.\u201d She turned a page. He noticed the hole on her sweater cuff where a thumb should go but just a thread went. \u201cMy father\u2019s a welder. My mother stocks shelves at night at Smith\u2019s. My little brother does Fortnite and algebra at the same time. I\u2019m at the U for literature but slowly, because money is a language too and I have an accent.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to say something worthy. \u201cYou\u2019re good at this,\u201d he said instead, and she shrugged the way only someone who knows the truth of such a sentence shrugs.\n\nAt work, he found that words swam. He would be in a meeting with a man from Ogden who ran a business buying and selling metal roofs and he would watch, out of the corner of his eye, the shape of the man\u2019s mouth on certain vowels, and think about how \u201ctecho\u201d sounded like a toy, and how \u201cinterest\u201d and \u201cinter\u00e9s\u201d were siblings with a long-standing grudge. He\u2019d go to Steiner and swim laps and hear \u201cuno, dos, tres\u201d in the back of his head, like a metronome he had not given permission to but was grateful for anyway. At night he would practice in his kitchen, \u201cYo quiero\u2014,\u201d and the refrigerator would hum in an encouraging key.\n\nHe stopped by Rancho Market on his way home from the bank, as he had been instructed. The aisles felt like a party he had walked into late, the bread loud with sesame, the butcher counter a display of frankness. He stood in the line for oranges and listened to a woman in scrubs call the cashier \u201cmi amor,\u201d and the young man with forearms like straight roads call her \u201cjefa,\u201d and the cashier reply, \u201cqu\u00e9 m\u00e1s, pues,\u201d and he did not understand every word but knew it was not about more, not really, but about making space. He bought twelve oranges. In the parking lot he put one on his tongue right away and nearly laughed, the juice so unexpectedly urgent.\n\nOn the fourth Tuesday, he told her a story about a client who had refused to sign something because of a superstition about the number written on the page. He told it poorly, fragmented by tense and his own seriousness. Halfway through she leaned forward and touched his arm, a light, brief thing, and said, \u201cYou can also say it like this,\u201d and she recast his story in that other rhythm, rounding and bright, and he felt seen in a way that made him a little ashamed of how long he had gone without that feeling. He looked at her mouth while she spoke, because he was supposed to, and then allowed himself to look at the curve of her cheek. He looked away too quickly and then too slow and the moment went back to being a lesson.\n\nHe had dated, in the past, with varied outcomes and no disasters that counted to anyone but the participants. He had been engaged, once, to a woman named Clare who had loved his steadiness until she did not. They had parted in a way they both agreed was adult, which is not the same as kind. On Sundays he sometimes missed the liturgy he had grown up in, the rooms where he knew exactly where to put his hands, exactly when to kneel and when to rise. Sometimes he would sit at a caf\u00e9 and consider walking to a chapel where nobody expected him anymore and then stand up and pay his bill and go home instead.\n\nWhen March turned the city\u2019s parks to false spring and then back again to dirty snow, Mara changed their meeting place. \u201cDo you mind if we move it to Mestizo next week,\u201d she texted him. \u201cThere\u2019s an exhibit there my friend curated and I promise the coffee is not burnt.\u201d\n\nHe got there a little early and pretended again to read the community board. An advertisement for an open mic night made him wince on behalf of fragile humankind. He ordered coffee and a pastry that was more generous than it needed to be. Small paintings hung on the walls, some good enough to make him want to be alone with them, some like you could see the painter\u2019s hunger still wet on the canvas. On a table by the door was a stack of zines, their stapled spines determined and crooked.\n\nMara came with a friend, which startled him. The woman was tall, with a streak of white in her hair that made her look like something had chosen her. \u201cThis is Jill,\u201d Mara said. \u201cShe\u2019s a social worker. Jill, this is Benjamin, he is learning how to say really important things like \u2018what time is the loan due\u2019 and \u2018where are the oranges.\u2019\u201d\n\nJill shook his hand in a way that told him she was not entirely joking. \u201cNice to meet you,\u201d she said. \u201cMara was going to tell you about the fundraiser next month but she wanted to see if you\u2019d run away at the mention of the word fundraiser.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like fundraisers,\u201d Benjamin said, lying in a very strangely sincere way.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m curating the art,\u201d Jill said, gesturing at the walls. \u201cThis is sort of practice, except with less wine. We\u2019re raising money for a little program in Rose Park that is definitely not a non-profit because nobody has time for paperwork, but it teaches kids to write about themselves instead of letting other people do it for them. You\u2019re welcome to come, buy utterly overpriced prints and food you could make at home for half the cost, and meet people who will talk to you very directly about housing but not tell you where they live.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come,\u201d he said, and saw the way Mara\u2019s eyes flickered\u2014approval, amusement, a small surprise that was not quite surprise.\n\nThey did their lesson anyway. When Jill had to go she kissed Mara\u2019s cheek and squeezed Benjamin\u2019s shoulder as if they were already all friends. He watched her go and wondered about Mara\u2019s world, the one in which people held onto one another without hesitation and did their work in rooms with walls that remembered every conversation and kept some of them safe.\n\nAfter they finished conjugating and then breaking the conjugation into smaller pieces so he could fit it into his mouth, she said, \u201cWhat do you do when you\u2019re not banking and repeating after me? Do you still swim?\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cI also hike in the summer, because it is required by city ordinance, and ski in the winter, but badly. I read. I pretend to cook. I try not to think about how we knocked Mike Trout\u2019s forty-million-dollar season into our conversations like it was a normal amount of money to say out loud.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you like your job?\u201d she said.\n\nHe considered. \u201cI like being useful,\u201d he said. \u201cI like when I can say yes. Sometimes I say no and I think I am a grown-up but sometimes I say no and I think I am just a small guard at a gate that shouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d\n\nShe looked at him in the way she sometimes did, like he was not a worksheet but a person. \u201cYou could write,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who think like that always write.\u201d\n\nHe laughed. \u201cWhat, like poems?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody gets one bad poem and three good ones if they live long enough.\u201d She tapped the book he carried now without missing a day. \u201cSor Juana would tell you what to do if you asked her. She would make a face and then she would tell you.\u201d\n\nHe went to the fundraiser. He told himself it would be support, and also homework. It was in a borrowed space in a warehouse by the tracks, a place that smelled like wood and possibility. People were there in every decade of age and wearing clothes that had clearly been purchased with different intentions. A woman sold empanadas that felt like a kindness when held. On one wall hung photographs of a city he recognized beyond its brochure version: a toddler on a stoop licking something that had melted faster than anyone could eat it, a man fixing a bicycle with a concentration that was obviously love.\n\nMara was working a table by the door, taking cash and smiling without making it cheap. When she saw him she raised her eyebrows, pleased and surprised, and he felt a small, bright victory he had no right to. She introduced him to more people\u2014Jill again, and a man named David who ran an after-school program and had the tiredness of someone who had chosen his work every day, and a woman named Tamsin who owned a gallery and dressed like the concept of winter. It was not his world. It did not feel that way and it did. He found himself talking in Spanish to a teenager about a zine he had made and understood every other sentence and made the rest up.\n\nAfter an hour, he realized he had never before been at a fundraiser where nobody asked him for a pledge. Here they asked him if he could come on Tuesday afternoons to read aloud to kids whose parents would not be home yet. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anything else from you,\u201d Jill said, a glitter of warning in it. \u201cDon\u2019t bring us your banking ideas. Bring your voice.\u201d\n\nHe said he would try, knowing that trying was a word that often meant almost. He made a donation anyway. It was probably too much. It was perhaps not enough.\n\nOn their way out into the night, Mara folded a paper program into a plane and then unfolded it again, the crease made and unmade. \u201cGracias,\u201d she said. \u201cFor coming.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to,\u201d he said. He did not add for you, though the words pushed like a crowd behind a door.\n\nShe tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cYou should be careful,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWith Spanish?\u201d he said, and she laughed, covering her mouth, as if that would keep the church ladies from gossiping.\n\n\u201cWith me,\u201d she said, softly and not softly. \u201cI know it\u2019s a thing to warn people about. I don\u2019t mean it dramatically. It\u2019s just\u2014I have, I guess, feet in different rooms. And I\u2019ve been bad at not getting pulled.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to ask what rooms. He also knew that question was more than a question. He said, \u201cMe too,\u201d because he had meant it about church and work and the way sometimes the trails in Millcreek could make him believe one thing very clearly in the morning and a different thing in the afternoon. He looked at her and realized he had already reached toward her in a way that was not reversible.\n\nHe slept badly that night. The city made its own small strains and groans. He dreamed he was sitting at a long table with his family and they were speaking Spanish and he was not. He woke up laughing, a small, desperate little sound, and then lay there not moving, the ceiling a new Bible he did not know by heart.\n\nOn Monday morning he went to work and said yes to two things and no to one and looked out the window at the line of winter and spring arguing without either of them having to say a word. He looked down at a man sleeping on a heating grate with his whole body trying to tuck itself back into itself. He thought of what a banker was, and what it was not.\n\nOn Tuesday he went to the library and found Mara at the table with someone else\u2019s head bowed next to her. For a second he thought he had gotten the time wrong. Then she looked up and smiled with that same shape and waved him over, but her eyes were different.\n\n\u201cThis is Caleb,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s applying for something hideous and needs to know whether to say whom. Benjamin, can you wait five minutes?\u201d\n\nHe sat. He waited. He watched the two of them in their quick shorthand, the way she underlined and his mouth twisted at his own sentence. This is not jealousy, he told himself, absolutely, this is a normal human who has no rights to this person acknowledging that she exists in a world that does not yet include the particular role he wishes to audition for. He felt ridiculous and then he felt like he would remember this moment later and it would mean something else entirely.\n\nAfter Caleb stood and shook his hand and left, Mara turned to him and what changed in her eyes changed back. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI know we said six. He texted and needed something. He\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s a lot. He makes friends with judges.\u201d\n\n\u201cJudges,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOf poetry,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich is more dangerous than the first kind.\u201d\n\nThey worked. He could feel, under, the small drift of her attention to something that was not him. It made him precise, for a little while; it made him sloppy, later. When he left he passed Caleb on the sidewalk, smoking, and the man had a manner\u2014loose, practiced\u2014that made Benjamin want to go home and iron his shirts for the second time.\n\nIt was a nothing, he told himself. It was everything, he also accidentally told himself.\n\nThey kept meeting. He got better, which astonished him, like the way dogs in a park have to be surprised every day that the door opens and there is grass waiting. He sketched, in his mind, what it would be to invite Mara for coffee after the lesson that already included coffee, to ask her for a walk when the warm days came back for real, to offer to drive her to Park City one afternoon in June because she had mentioned vaguely she liked to go there once a year to see the kind of houses that were not on her street. He rehearsed in his car. He practiced how not to sound like a man performing sincerity. He failed in the rehearsals and said to himself that failure in practice was proof of wisdom.\n\nOne afternoon he found himself lingering too long on a photograph in her phone. It was without context\u2014a shot of her and two women in dresses standing on the balcony of a building that was clearly not in his part of town, the view sweeping toward white streets and lights. \u201cPark City,\u201d she said when she saw his eyes catch. \u201cA party. Jill\u2019s friend Tamsin. She has a gallery and a\u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter. It was one of those nights where the lights were very impressed with themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look happy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI was,\u201d she said, and then tilted her head, and said, \u201cEverybody was being very kind. And very not kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s that work?\u201d he said, knowing exactly how, and wanting to hear her say it anyway. The word class did not appear; it was unnecessary.\n\nShe shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s like being fed. You get full. But later you realize you didn\u2019t get anything to drink.\u201d\n\nHe did not ask whether Caleb had been there. The question sat down anyway between them.\n\nWhen he asked her for coffee she said yes and then the next morning texted no. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t.\u201d When he asked, neutral as he could make it, \u201cShouldn\u2019t?\u201d she wrote back, \u201cI\u2019m trying to keep work as work. It\u2019s not you. It\u2019s my promises to myself. And to my\u2014 family.\u201d\n\nHe said he understood. He said it in the language he was learning and the one he had been born into. He practiced moving past it. He wasn\u2019t good at it. He didn\u2019t drown.\n\nWhen spring came in earnest, the mountains were right there again, abrupt with their own logic. He went up Millcreek Canyon one afternoon and hiked until the snow stopped being a trick and started being snow. He stood and listened to water fighting to get out from under, the sound both ancient and brand-new. He thought about Mara and told himself, sternly, go slow. He slipped on a patch of ice and went down hard and laughed until his elbow hurt less.\n\nIn mid-May, after a lesson in which he successfully told a small story about a loan officer and a cow and the way a misunderstanding had turned into something beautiful, she told him she would be changing their schedule. \u201cI got a job,\u201d she said, her smile not quite reaching her eyes. \u201cAt the gallery. The one I told you about. Just for the summer. The money is stupid and so I said yes. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d She paused. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 I mean I am happy. I am not the right kind of happy for you to think I should be.\u201d\n\nHe did not know how to contain his face. He tamped it down. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s great. Congratulations.\u201d He meant it. He did not.\n\n\u201cWe can keep Tuesdays for now,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I might move around some nights. There will be events. I\u2019ll invite you if you want. They will be very amusing. You will have to pretend microgreens are more important than they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t try too hard,\u201d she said.\n\nHe went home and looked at the Sor Juana and then put her back down. He went for a walk. He passed, on the corner, a couple arguing in a way that was too quiet to be a fight and too loud to be anything else. He kept walking.\n\nOn a Thursday he walked across Main at dusk and saw her through the glass of a restaurant, seated at a table with Tamsin and three men with cuffs he would not have dared crease. Her dress was a color he did not have a word for without Google. She laughed and put her hand on Tamsin\u2019s wrist, and then leaned back and looked for a second out the window and her gaze slid past him and then she saw him and did an almost imperceptible double-take, pulled the corner of her mouth into a small private thing, then resumed. He wanted to go inside and kiss her. He wanted to go home. He did neither. He stood and watched until the light changed and then he crossed and did not look again.\n\nOn Saturday he went to the farmer\u2019s market at Pioneer Park and bought radishes and a loaf of bread and watched children with their faces painted eat strawberries with an urgency that made him miss being five. He bumped into Jill, whose hair was pulled back and who had a tote bag full of something leafy. \u201cSo you\u2019re an adult who keeps promises to come to things,\u201d she said. \u201cYou all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, then added, \u201cMara got the job.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Jill said. \u201cShe\u2019ll be great and she\u2019ll hate it and then she\u2019ll love it and then she\u2019ll hate it correctly. You?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will be supportive at a reasonable distance,\u201d he said.\n\nJill looked at him. \u201cYou are very sweet,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich is not always a compliment, but I mean it. Don\u2019t get eaten. By us. Or by them.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to ask, who is us; who is them. He didn\u2019t, because he knew; because it was clear that both words moved depending on where your feet were. He bought more radishes than any human should and went home and listened to Sor Juana tell him what a tongue can do in a mouth that wants.\n\nHe texted Mara that night. \u201cCongratulations again. I keep thinking about what you said about being fed. If you need a drink of water, I have a sink.\u201d\n\nShe wrote back, after an hour, \u201cThank you. That is probably the best and most ridiculous message anyone\u2019s sent me this week. I do need water. I don\u2019t know from where yet. But I\u2019ll let you know if your sink is the one.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways here,\u201d he wrote. Then, without waiting for the little ellipses to appear, he put his phone face-down on the table and sat on his couch and turned off the light and let the room wrap him without promises.\n\nAt their next lesson, she arrived late, hair pinned up in a way that did not attempt to appear effortless. He pretended not to notice. He was trying to be the kind of person who could say \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d and mean it. She smelled like a place he had not been.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing the past tense today,\u201d she said, dropping a stack of cards on the table. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about everything you did and didn\u2019t do. It\u2019s a trap, because then you tell me your life story and I correct your grammar instead of your choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did it on purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cNot actually. Probably not.\u201d\n\nShe laughed and then rubbed her eyes. He saw then how tired settled into a face in delicate ways. \u201cI stayed at an opening until midnight,\u201d she said. \u201cA man told me I had changed his life with my placement of his work beside a window. He did not realize I had simply run out of wall.\u201d\n\nHe had nothing to say that would not make both of them someone else. They did the past tense the way she had promised\u2014badly at first, laughing, then better, then to the point where he could say \u201cI wanted\u201d and mean \u201cI should have\u201d without asking for mercy from the verb. Halfway through, a man in a navy suit approached their table and put his hand on the back of Mara\u2019s chair as if it had already been waiting for his hand. \u201cMara,\u201d he said.\n\nShe looked up. \u201cHi,\u201d she said. \u201cTom\u00e1s, this is Benjamin. He\u2019s my student. Benjamin, this is Tom\u00e1s. He\u2014works with Tamsin.\u201d She did not make the sentence mean more than that. Tom\u00e1s glanced at Benjamin with the quick, practiced appraisal of a person who had entered a room with a plan and did not like anything that had not come in the plan. He was handsome in the way an elevator is handsome. He made a polite noise. \u201cWe\u2019re running late,\u201d he said to Mara, in a tone both apologetic and not apologetic at all.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m working,\u201d she said, and looked at Benjamin in a way that made him part of a triangle. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in thirty minutes.\u201d\n\nTom\u00e1s made a small show of checking the time and then a larger show of smiling. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said, with an accent that Benjamin\u2019s ears, now attuned to such things, placed as somewhere south of where he had expected, and north of where Mara had been born. He left a hand on the chair a second too long. Then it was gone. He left.\n\nBenjamin had never wanted to win anything in that way before. It embarrassed him. It exhilarated him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mara said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be,\u201d he said, and knew he wanted her to be. He began to laugh and then made himself stop. \u201cWe can stop early if you need to.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, too quickly. \u201cNo. I like this. I don\u2019t want to only\u2014\u201d She looked for a word and found it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to only perform.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome performances are necessary,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you do it all day and then you do it all night then you wake up and you look in the mirror and think: who is she, and why is she in my apartment.\u201d\n\nHe hardly breathed. \u201cWho is she?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEveryone else\u2019s idea,\u201d she said, crisp and almost cheerful, in the way a person sometimes tells you a difficult thing with a practiced ease so you won\u2019t flinch and so she won\u2019t either.\n\nThey conjugated until the hour was over and then he walked with her to the entrance and watched her meet Tom\u00e1s half a block away, watched the way she put her hand on her own shoulder, a small, self-comforting thing, and then drop it in case someone would call it weakness. He stood there until he felt foolish and then he walked home the long way and told himself that this story would take a long time to be told right. He told himself not to try to aim the end of it. He told himself he could wait, which was both true and false and a kind of the only thing he could do.\n\nHe put the book on his table, open to a place where Sor Juana described desire like a horse that won\u2019t wear a bit. He said the words out loud even though he did not need to and thought, briefly, of women who put words in their mouths and made men listen whether they wanted to or not.\n\nThe city turned toward summer. The light stayed late like a guest with something left to say. He saw Mara twice a week, then once, then not at all for one stretch of nine days that felt like an experiment he had not consented to. When she returned she was brighter, somehow, and also far away, like a street seen at night through rain. He wanted to tell her he could stand rain. He wanted to tell her nothing. He told her the story in Spanish of how he had once fallen in love with a woman who wanted the sea more than she wanted him, and how he had tried to become tide. He told it badly, but she understood. He could see it in her eyes. He could see also that understanding and choosing were cousins who did not always speak.\n\nIn the middle of June he saw her at the top of the City Creek stairs with a cluster of people who were making plans for an after party he had not been invited to, watched her listen and watch them watch themselves. She turned, caught his gaze, mouthed something he later translated to \u201csoon,\u201d and he nodded, and they stood thirty feet apart and felt both exactly where they were and also far. He went home and washed his dishes as if the plates could teach him how to wait without bitterness.\n\nHe had not known, when he called the number on a newspaper like a boy answering a carnival ad, that he was enrolling in a tenderness with a lesson plan. He did not know how many quizzes were coming. But by the end of June, when he could tell the story of his day in the past tense without stopping to apologize to the verbs, he knew this: that he had not been wrong to put his feet in a different room and try to speak in a voice that was not his own. That it would take him longer than he had thought to be understood. That he had already begun to translate not just himself but the way he wanted to be in the world\u2014slower, aspirin-like, dissolving into something and making it less painful.\n\nHe also knew that the air on evenings when he passed the gallery was different around the door, as if air itself got ready to perform. He knew that he would keep going in anyway, with his tie slightly askew, with the book in his bag, with oranges on his counter at home turning toward sweetness. He knew the mountain didn't care about any of this and also cared about all of it, because it took everything and made it weather and let it fall again somewhere else. He knew that July would be a heat that softened everything\u2019s edges and then made them sharp again, and that he would stand in it and learn the imperfect, and that the future tense would require more faith than he had expected. He knew, most of all, that he would not stop moving his mouth, learning how to say what he wanted and then wanting to say it better.\n\nOne hot night at the end of the month, he found himself on his porch, the street humming with a low summer sound, and he imagined a life in which he could say to Mara, simple as oranges, I love you. He practiced it, silently, then aloud like a fool. Te amo. Te quiero. He told the dark what he did not yet have the right to tell a person. It did not answer. It was okay. He had scarcely begun.Chapter 3\n\nThe first time he read to the kids in Rose Park, he lost his place three times and nobody noticed or everyone did and all of them were kind enough not to say. The room was an old classroom that had decided it would be a community center now, the chalkboards painted over and a string of paper suns hanging limp above an air conditioner that had given up in another decade. David stood in the back with his arms crossed and his eyes soft, and a girl with a purple backpack held a plastic tiara between her teeth while she drew a fox. Benjamin opened a book with a rabbit on the cover and remembered how many stories were about someone trying to leave home and how many ended with someone getting lost, and then how many of those made the getting lost feel like a place you could live in for a while.\n\nHe began in English because that was what his mouth did when scared. Then he stopped and started again in Spanish, slow at first, each syllable like a step on stones across water. The words were for children but carried a weight that surprised him, a weight that was not the opposite of light. The kids listened the way kids listen when the adult is doing something potentially embarrassing and might need to be rescued, which is to say with attention disguised as boredom. He said conejo and a boy in a red shirt corrected him so gently it felt like being handed a cup of water. He said bosque and the girl with the tiara in her mouth said, you can make it softer, like you\u2019re telling the trees they\u2019re safe. He laughed and tried again, and when he got it right, two of them nodded with the solemnity of judges and he felt something inside him unclench without making it a scene.\n\nAfterward a small boy named Mario stood close and asked, in English, if Benjamin knew any stories where the rabbit didn\u2019t win. Benjamin told him about rabbits and foxes, about stories where the clever animal is not the rabbit or where the fox is tired of being evil. He asked Mario if he knew any, and Mario told him one about a turtle who just stopped and sighed and said, today I don\u2019t want to race, and everybody left him alone and that was the end. Benjamin said, that\u2019s a good story, and Mario looked at him like he had given him a gift and didn\u2019t want to make a big deal of it.\n\nOn his way out, Jill was at the door putting flyers under a magnet shaped like Utah with the upper corner chipped off so it looked like the state was wincing. She adjusted her tote bag and asked, without ceremony, if he would come next week. He said yes with less hesitation than he had expected from himself, and when she nodded, he realized that he had been waiting for a woman who wore seriousness like an accessory to approve of him in this specific way. She said something about how the kids could smell effort and mercy both, and he said something about how he would bring oranges, and she said, bring napkins too, because oranges make lines on the floor that become evidence.\n\nWork ran like a machine beside all of this and sometimes through it. He sat in meetings where debt service coverage ratios and amortization schedules made a tidy kind of music, and in those same meetings he found himself listening to a foreman who had come along for the owner, the man\u2019s hands cut and dark at the knuckles, and tried out, quietly, a question in Spanish about the timing of deliveries. The foreman answered in a sigh of relief like a car\u2019s engine turning after weeks in snow, and the owner looked grateful and a little surprised, which was its own kind of math. Later, in the elevator, a coworker in a tie that looked expensive enough to be told the truth asked if he was picking up something for a woman and Benjamin said, yes, language, and the coworker laughed like a joke had been delivered on time.\n\nSaturday was the gallery opening that made Mara write \u201cmicrogreens, help me\u201d with four slanted exclamation points. He stood in front of his mirror in a shirt that made him look like he had tried, then disarranged it deliberately so he didn\u2019t scare himself. The gallery was all white and comment, every surface prepared for witnesses. The lighting did that thing where it found the best in everything and made it look inevitable. People gathered in clusters that arranged themselves like small economies, independent but narrating the same story. He felt foolish for five minutes, then stopped feeling foolish and started feeling like someone looking at a map with all the cities marked in a language he could almost read if he tilted his head.\n\nMara moved through it not like someone who belonged but like someone who could teach belonging. She wore a black dress that complicated the idea of simple and a pair of earrings that might have been practical except that they weren\u2019t. When she saw him she came to him the way you come to a place you remember from childhood: completely, and then with a check of whatever internal watch tells you the seconds that matter. He had brought a bottle of something forgettable and she took it as if it was exactly right and put it behind the bar and then confessed she didn\u2019t know where anything went. He asked if she needed help and she said, always, and then told him to please talk to people and to not try to be useful because that would be the most useful thing.\n\nTom\u00e1s appeared beside her the way a person with rights to a room appears. He was wearing a suit that had found his shoulders and decided to adopt them. He shook Benjamin\u2019s hand and said the right words in the right order in a voice that ran smooth where Benjamin\u2019s had burrs. They stood together for a moment, three people pretending they were not measuring anything. Tom\u00e1s asked Benjamin what he did at the bank, and Benjamin told him in a sentence that was true and small, and Tom\u00e1s nodded as if he had been given a weather report, then turned to greet a couple whose laughter had arrived before they had. Tamsin swept in and told Mara she had saved something with a placement and that also she had ruined something else with another placement and how wonderful to do both in the same hour, and then kissed Benjamin on the cheek like he was a person at sea they had all agreed would reach shore.\n\nA photographer asked Mara if he could take her picture next to a painting of water that refused to admit it was blue, and Mara agreed and then positioned herself to look like she hadn\u2019t. Benjamin watched the flash mark the room and thought about how light pretends to be not heavy and is always lying. He found himself talking to a man about a sculpture made of bent nails and agricultural twine, and the man told him a story about his father\u2019s hands, and then suddenly he and the man were both a little embarrassed by how easily they had been led there. He ate something green on a chip that had been warned not to break, and then he did break it, and it felt good to be ungentle for once.\n\nHe didn\u2019t drink more than he could carry home, which meant he didn\u2019t drink much. On his way out to breathe air that had not been informed of its responsibilities, he ran into Caleb smoking, his grin set at 70 percent mischief. Caleb asked him if he had liked the poem on the wall with the red string and Benjamin said he had liked the string, and they both pretended that was a conversation about art. Caleb asked about the kids at the center, and when Benjamin told him about Mario and the turtle, Caleb\u2019s face softened and then sharpened, like he had put away something that might have been kind and replaced it with something that would survive. He flicked his cigarette into a bucket that had a label that said NOT WATER written in marker like an accusation, and then went back inside as if the place were a sentence he had left unfinished.\n\nOn Sunday his mother called and asked him to come over for dinner, which meant the table would be set in the particular correct way and the roast would be overdone in the exact right direction. He arrived with a pie he hadn\u2019t made and his father opened the door as if the house had been needing fresh air. The first five minutes were always about shoes and whether the porch light worked and if the lawn had discovered the audacity to yellow, and then they would move to the careful topics as if they had coordinates. They ate mashed potatoes and talked about gas prices with the gravitas worthy of a funeral, and then his mother asked about work and his father asked how the Jazz were playing in the postseason as if the outcome had been in doubt in heaven.\n\nWhen he said he was volunteering with kids after school on Tuesdays and reading to them in Spanish, his mother put down her fork in the way she did when she didn\u2019t want to drop it. She said that sounded good, and his father said, in that voice you use when you are trying to be helpful and it comes out like a warning, that Rose Park had changed and you had to be careful where you parked after dark and that he remembered when he had driven a route up there and how some corners kept the evening too long. Benjamin said the kids were fine and he went before it was dark and that the most dangerous thing that had happened was that a rabbit hadn\u2019t won, and his mother laughed even though she didn\u2019t get it and asked if he was dating anyone and he said he was learning the imperfect tense and there was a pause that lasted exactly as long as it takes to decide to sigh.\n\nHe did what he always did, which was to not pick the fight and to feel the fight buzz around him like something that might land later. After dessert, his mother stood with him at the sink and asked what the tutor\u2019s name was, and he said Mara, and his mother said, lovely, and not in a way that meant anything other than the shape of the word in her mouth. He dried plates while she told him about Sister Jensen\u2019s cousin\u2019s grandson who had made partner at a firm whose name sounded like a cough, and he nodded and looked out the window at the mountains that had never asked to be described as anyone\u2019s witness and were anyway.\n\nWhen he left, he drove the slow way back to the city. You could cut onto the freeway and count the miles like a person impatient to end a paragraph, or you could let the road curl around itself, past the cemetery where the headstones looked like teeth, past the view that had been sold a thousand times as if it were mineable. The air had the late-spring smell of a place that would be like it was forever for three days, and then not anymore. He rolled the window down and listened to an old woman on a porch talking to a dog as if the dog were responsible for the economy, and he loved the woman for thinking it might be.\n\nMara texted him on Monday afternoon: \u201cImperfect tomorrow. Bring your best memories and your worst.\u201d He sent back a half-hearted emoji and then wrote, \u201cI will bring the time I almost went on a mission and the way I didn\u2019t,\u201d and then almost deleted it, and then didn\u2019t. She wrote, \u201cAh,\u201d and then she wrote, \u201cI suppose we will conjugate regret,\u201d and he felt grateful for someone who would not let him position himself as either tragic or brave.\n\nAt the library, they took a table by the windows and watched a storm organize itself with unnecessary theatrics over the foothills. The glass kept the lightning polite and made the thunder feel like a rumor. She wrote on their shared page: quer\u00eda, pod\u00eda, pensaba, sol\u00eda, and said, this is where you get to be messy, and then promptly made him be precise. He told her that he used to go to early-morning seminary and sometimes he would sit in a parking lot afterward and not know if it had been a good idea to wake up, and she asked if he had wanted the mornings, in that way you can want something and want it gone, and he said yes, and then tried to say it in Spanish and fell over his own mouth and she picked him up and dusted him off with a look.\n\nHe asked her what she used the imperfect for, and she said everything that refuses to end. She said summers, and the smell of tortillas, and her grandmother humming a song without words while folding laundry, and the way she used to count coins to see how close it was to the month. He asked her if you could use it for wanting, and she said, absolutely, she used it that way all the time, but that sometimes the preterite is honest, sometimes you wanted and then you stopped. He said he was not the preterite type and she laughed and said nobody is until they are.\n\nThe library lost power for ten minutes and everybody reacted as if this had been the plan. A child near them squealed with delight and a man by the register muttered as if the electricity owed him a personal apology. They went outside and sat on the steps and watched the rain attempt to make grand entrances at three places on the plaza and get interrupted by wind each time. Mara bought two paletas from a cart whose umbrella was attempting to become a bird, and handed him one that tasted like mango pretending to be something more grown up. He said thank you in Spanish and she said de nada and then, because she was a contrary, she said, you\u2019re welcome, too, and his desire to lay his head against her shoulder felt like a very small boat looking at a very large ocean and considering its chances.\n\nHe didn\u2019t, and he was proud of himself and also a little sad. The power came back on and people clapped because they were people. They went back in and conjugated survival until the hour felt satisfied. When he apologized for telling her too many things and making language into a confessional, she waved her hand and said she would invoice him for time and secrets both and that he should bring more secrets because they made good practice, and he said, you are very kind to charge me for therapy at a tutoring rate, and she said, I could up my prices, and he said, please don\u2019t, and they both smiled and then looked away.\n\nAt work the next day, he said no to a man with a plan that would have made him money and also made him more absent, and he said yes to a woman who had a produce business that made sense at the margins and didn\u2019t anywhere else, which meant he called someone else and asked for a favor, which meant he had to cash a small chip he\u2019d meant to save for something that would benefit him more. He walked down Main at lunch and ate a burrito that was too much food for a single person and then ate it anyway out of respect for the person who had made it. He stopped in Rancho Market and bought a bag of limes only to stand in line for two minutes and listen, as she had told him to do months ago, and he heard a woman scold gently and a man reply with a joke that belonged only to that place, and he loved being allowed to hear that more than almost anything that week.\n\nHe tried, at night, to write a poem in Spanish. It was a terrible poem that could not decide whether to bow or make demands, and it featured a horse because Sor Juana had given him one and he didn\u2019t know how to give it back. He wrote tres versiones of the same line about heat and only one of them didn\u2019t sound like a mistranslated warning on a hairdryer. He read it out loud and it was worse out loud. He texted Jill to ask if there was an open mic where he could embarrass himself and she wrote back, not tonight, don\u2019t be ridiculous, but come on Thursday and listen to other people be brave, and he said yes because he had made it a practice to say yes to people whose eyes had a certain steel in them.\n\nThursday night, he stood in the back of a room with a microphone and a stool and a lot of expectations. People took turns standing up and telling the truth badly and beautifully. Caleb read something that started out like a joke about name tags and turned into a fierce little thing about who gets to call you what, and there was a line about water that made three people shift in their seats and made Benjamin understand that jealous and admiring are doors that lead to the same sudden drop. He clapped with everyone else and then went home and wrote a note to himself that said, not now, but do not act like a person who is not doing anything.\n\nLate in June, Mara texted him at eleven, which was rare. \u201cAre you awake,\u201d she wrote, which was a question that didn\u2019t need answering because he always was, lately, the way summer makes black coffee of sleep. He wrote back that he was awake and that his sink had water and his walls had ears but they weren\u2019t mean. She asked if she could call, and then she did without waiting, and her voice was the voice of someone walking home in heels with her shoes in her hands. She told him about a collector who had wanted her to pose with a sculpture in a photograph for a magazine he would print himself and never show to anyone, just to know he had printed it, and how she had said no and then yes and then no again and how it felt like performing honesty in a mirror. He said the correct minimum and the correct extra and she laughed a little at his correct extra and said she would be better at boundaries next week and he said he was already proud of last week and also this one, and she was quiet for a second and said, you are dangerous because you talk like that, and he said, I learned it from poets and bankers, and she said that was either charming or chilling and she\u2019d decide in the morning.\n\nIn early July the heat came in and set down bags and declared itself a resident. The swamp coolers on the roofline did their best to make it feel like July in a different decade. The mountains faded each late afternoon and then appeared again like a trick that had been perfected over a century. Mara warned him she would miss a Tuesday and he responded as if he were not disappointed, and then she missed two and he went to the center and read a book about a dog who wanted to be a moon and was told by a six-year-old that dogs cannot be moons because they are already stars. He told Jill he felt foolish showing up with oranges when half the kids had eaten their weight in paletas and she told him, juice makes stains that make memories, do it anyway.\n\nHe ran into Tom\u00e1s once at a coffee shop where the espresso was a little too proud of itself. Tom\u00e1s was holding a stack of catalogs and talked about a fair in New York and a museum in Denver and said, without making it sound like a warning, that Mara was going places this summer. Benjamin said, that\u2019s good, and Tom\u00e1s said, yes, in a way that contained many things, including the suspicion that Benjamin was being asked to keep up and might not want to run. They stood and said the things that men say when neither of them has a claim to the topic but both feel obliged to speak, and then they smiled at the same time and retreated, polite to the last.\n\nMore than once, Benjamin imagined walking into the gallery and asking Mara to leave with him. Not in a dramatic way, not as if he were rescuing anyone, but as a way of asking whether her feet would choose his sidewalk for a moment. He did not do it. He went in and looked at a painting of a kitchen in Oaxaca and smelled onions and oil and a floor that had been mopped not recently and felt homesick for a place he had never been. Mara came and stood beside him for a minute and let him stand beside her without speaking, the way you let a dog put its head on your knee when you both know what that means and you both also know it doesn\u2019t, on its own, change anything.\n\nThe imperfect entered his tongue like something that had been waiting for permission. He learned to say I used to, I would always, I was going to, and each one made him feel as if he were telling a friend a secret in the back booth of a diner where the waitress called you hon and meant it. He said quer\u00eda and meant it across two languages, and when he told Mara that he wanted to want correctly, she said there was no correct, only precise, and that precision was a mercy you could give to yourself. He said, I wanted to go on a mission and I did not, and I wanted to want God the way I was told to, and I didn\u2019t, and I wanted to be a certain kind of man and I was another, and she wrote on the page: quer\u00eda, quise, fui, and then said, you are making this sound like a dissertation, and he said, I am a man in a tie, and she said, take the tie off, and he said, no, someone needs to be the man in the tie, and she looked at him like she had just remembered something important and said, that is not always a sentence you should be proud of.\n\nHe visited his parents again and didn\u2019t bring pie, and his mother took this as a sign of something she could not name and so did not mention. They watched a fireworks preview from the backyard because Bountiful celebrates early as if to get a head start on being patriotic and then richly tired. His father told a story about his own father, which he did sometimes and then would pretend to be annoyed with himself for doing. The story was about a winter and a truck and how some things you don\u2019t get to say no to, and Benjamin listened and nodded and then asked, gently, if there were things his father had said no to and been glad later, and his father said, you mean regrets, and Benjamin said, I mean victories, and his father looked at him as if he had been replaced by a man with the same face and then looked away because sometimes looking is lifting something you don\u2019t want to test the weight of.\n\nAfter the fireworks, his mother stood with him on the front lawn and said, very quietly, that she worried about him, and he said, very quietly, that he worried about him too, and she laughed a little and said that was not reassuring and also the most reassuring thing he\u2019d heard, and he kissed the top of her head and said goodnight and drove home with the radio off because sometimes you have to let your thoughts be their own static.\n\nA week later, he and Mara sat at Mestizo because the library was being cleaned in a way that suggested past sins and future squeaks. She was in jeans with paint on them that had not been arranged by an algorithm, and he was in the shirt that made him look like he had tried. They talked about verbs and then they didn\u2019t. She told him she wanted to drive to the lake one evening and sit and smell the brine and count the gulls and feel small but not belittled. He said he wanted to go with her and immediately regretted the way it had come out like a boy asking for an invitation to the cool lunch table, and she saved him by saying maybe with a smile that was not a door, at least not yet.\n\nThey walked out into the heat and it wrapped them like a blanket that had forgotten to be soft. A man at the bus stop argued with a friend no one could see and then apologized to the bench for raising his voice. Mara said she had not slept enough in weeks and that if she took one nap she would never wake up, and he said he dreamed in Spanish sometimes now and the sentences were kinder there, and she said that was because he had put kindness into the language himself. He asked what she dreamed in and she said she dreamed in work and in fear and in a strange peace that sometimes came to her like a hand, and then she said she was being dramatic and he said, no, you\u2019re not, and she rolled her eyes at him and then smiled because the last thing she wanted was a man agreeing too earnestly and the second to last thing she wanted was a man not listening.\n\nWhen they parted, he turned and watched her cross the street and then kept watching until she was on the other sidewalk. A gust of dry wind picked up a receipt and made it important for a second, and then put it down when it realized there was no script for it. He looked up at the mountain and thought about the way it had been described to him his whole life as something permanent and then how living in its shadow had taught him that permanence is just change with a long gait. He went home and cut into a cold orange and ate it over the sink and thought about a line he could not remember precisely from Sor Juana about the mind and the body or maybe about wanting and knowing and how they make jokes at each other\u2019s expense.\n\nOn a night when sleep was a dare, he stood on his porch again and watched a couple across the street rehearse the same quiet fight he had seen before. He had learned some of their Spanish and some of their sign language, the way the woman\u2019s hands made the shape of no without three letters in it and the way the man sat down even when standing would have been more dramatic. He loved them more than was appropriate for people he did not know, and he made a promise to no one in particular not to turn them into metaphors for his own purposes, and then failed and did it anyway, because he was a person and not a saint.\n\nHe texted Mara before midnight because he was weak and also because he had learned that sometimes you send the message you will regret and then you discover that regret can be a small price. He wrote, \u201cHoy le\u00ed a los ni\u00f1os. Ellos me corrigieron. Fue perfecto,\u201d and he put his phone face down and left it and then picked it up immediately because he was not a man who could wait for the world to do what it would do. She wrote back, \u201cEso es todo. Guardas esas correcciones como si fueran pan,\u201d and then added, \u201cGracias por seguir,\u201d and then, \u201cNo te mueras de calor,\u201d and he wrote back, \u201cNo me muero nada,\u201d and then realized that was not precisely right and corrected himself with the little star and she sent him a row of clapping hands as if he had rounded a base with his eyes open.\n\nThe heat deepened and flattened. The city kept breathing. He put his mouth around the imperfect again and again until it stopped feeling like a trick and started feeling like a room. He was thirty-five and he was talking like a man who had finally decided to believe his own mouth. He was not who he had been when he dialed a torn number taped to a counter, and he was not yet who he would be when the snow came back. He was practicing being a person whose wants had grammar, and whose grammar might save him from himself one long afternoon at a time. He could say I was going to love you and mean it without apology to the tense. He could say I used to be quiet and leave it on the table without anybody needing to pick it up and fix it. He could say, I would go to the lake, and he could wait for the answer without throwing his heart into the water first.\n\nWhen the first thunderstorm of July unrolled itself like a sermon you weren\u2019t sure you agreed with but loved the sound of, he went out to the porch again and leaned on the railing and watched the rain come in sideways. A teen in a white shirt stripped to the waist and stood under the downspout and made a performance of ecstasy that was perhaps sincere and perhaps for girls watching from a car and perhaps both. Benjamin laughed out loud and then stopped laughing because he was alone and it feels different to laugh alone. He whispered the imperfect to himself, the way a person will drum their fingers on a counter when they\u2019re waiting for a kettle. Quer\u00eda. Pod\u00eda. Sol\u00eda. And, in the dark, to no one and to himself, he tried, softly, a thing he had promised not to try without permission. Te quer\u00eda. He let the sentence sit with him like a dog at his feet that was not his dog but had decided to keep him company for a while. He hoped he would be forgiven for the practice. He thought, not for the first time, that there are worse sins than rehearsing kindness. He thought, not for the last time, that the only way out was through, a word at a time, with care and with errors and with the weather, which would always be more interesting than any of his stories and would make room for them anyway.Chapter 5\n\nBy the time the Days of \u201947 parade took over State Street and the floats moved like stubborn icebergs between bleachers of sunburn, the heat had found every crack and crawled in to stay. Flags wilted at the edge, drums slapped themselves awake, and horses did what horses will always do on pavement while a man with a broom walked behind and made modest acts into a service. Benjamin stood in the shade of a plane tree that grudgingly allowed its leaves to play host, a paper cup sweating in his hand. He could feel the city performing a version of itself he had inherited in hymns and handshakes: pioneer as noun and verb. Children waved from wagons dressed as prayers and a group of teens in matching shirts chanted in tones that meant nothing to outsiders and everything to the ones whose shoulders touched. He thought of how you can belong to a story for so long that you forget it\u2019s optional, until one day you realize you can set it down and then spend years reaching out to make sure it hasn\u2019t wandered away without you.\n\nHe sent a message to Mara before he could make it too careful. He wrote, \u201cYou said the lake. This week, when the sun is tired?\u201d The reply came after the marching band, after a cheer team built a human pyramid and made the top girl look brave enough to argue with gravity. \u201cYes,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTomorrow, if your tie can stand it. After the white heat is done pretending.\u201d He looked up at the strip of mountains and thought of the way the lake refused any performance but its own, and he imagined the brine flies lifting as one body and then settling as if they had changed their minds about being air.\n\nThey drove out in his car with the windows down and the air like a hair dryer on low. The causeway cut straight as a certainty and then the water gathered itself on both sides and pretended to be endless. It smelled, as always, like metal remembering salt, like something had been born, and something had died, and both of those things were reasonable. Mara kicked off her sandals and walked several feet ahead of him without needing him to see her do it, her dress moving around her like a sentence in a language that had decided not to be in a hurry. Brine flies startled in sheets and then returned in the same shape as if nothing had happened to them, which was not true and also true.\n\nThey sat on a low rock where someone had scratched the word home and then scratched it out. The water mirrored a sky that had done away with clouds to save everyone the trouble of interpretation. Mara handed him a paleta that had begun to concede to physics; mango again, but with a stripe of something that tasted like lime until it decided it was something else. \u201cWe should practice the future,\u201d she said, squinting at the line where everything pretended to end. \u201cIt\u2019s very arrogant, the future. I like it for that. Sometimes I need to be told what to believe.\u201d\n\nHe rolled amar\u00e9 around his mouth as if it were a hard candy he hadn\u2019t asked for. He said ir\u00e9 and the word made a small promise he wasn\u2019t sure he had earned the right to make. He said podremos and the plural felt like a handshake offered toward something he was still learning how to touch. Mara took a small stone and drew nothing on the salt, then watched the wind erase it with a thoroughness that felt personal. \u201cBe careful with the future,\u201d she said, not looking at him, the way you look out at water when you are discussing land. \u201cPeople like us put it on like a jacket and then we forget that weather happens anyway.\u201d\n\nHe asked her, very quietly, to tell him what us meant, and she nodded like he had asked a good question and did not answer. She told him instead about a night last week when she had stood in a kitchen in a house on the hill and watched a woman slice peaches like she was rich in time, and how the room had made her feel tender and then angry and then tender again until she was tired of herself. He told her about his father\u2019s laugh that came like a cough at the wrong time and how he had always loved it anyway, and she smiled like she was recognizing a distant relative in a crowd and then waved. He told her about wanting to stand between his job and the parts of his city that were already telling jokes about the people who would have to move when the punchline landed, and she put her hand on his wrist and said, \u201cDon\u2019t please perform decency for me. Just hold it.\u201d\n\nThey walked the waterline where the salt made small castles and then crushed them without regret. A boy threw stones and made the lake pretend to be wounded in a thousand concentric circles. A woman in a sunhat posed her dog against a backdrop of everything and the dog obliged with a dignity that seemed practiced. Benjamin said voy a intentarlo and meant a dozen things at once, and Mara said bien and meant at least two. When he said te querr\u00e9 without letting it be for her, she turned her face toward him and then away, as if the sun had managed to surprise her. \u201cNo me prometas nada que no puedas pagar,\u201d she said, and turned the sentence into a joke by letting the banker sit in it for a minute before she laughed and let him out.\n\nOn the way back he told her a story about a client who was a cousin of someone famous enough to be recognized at the gas station and how that had made the loan simultaneously more annoying and less interesting. She countered with a story about a collector who insisted on being called by a nickname he had invented for himself and how everyone obeyed because it is hard, in some rooms, to tell the truth without losing the thread. They drove in companionable not-speaking most of the way down the causeway, the lake finding its smell and forcing it through the vents no matter how they tried to hold it off. He held the wheel and thought about the line where pretends-to-be-end-water-a-sky traded names with itself until both were bored and then went back to work.\n\nIn Rose Park the next week, the swamp cooler wheezed and gave up and Jill stood on a chair and smacked it with the handle of a broom like she was reminding a stubborn animal it had a purpose. The room sagged and then took a breath and then did both again, and the kids made a game of not complaining. Benjamin read a book about a boy who thought he was a wolf until he remembered he was not and found this disappointing and freeing at the same time. Halfway through, the power played a trick it had learned from the storm at the library and died, and then somehow the story seemed more honest in the long, thin quiet. He stood still and let his mouth remember what it had memorized and the kids leaned back in their chairs and counted bug bites on their ankles like rosary beads.\n\nWhen it was over, a mother in a green shirt with a bleach mark in the shape of the state asked him in Spanish if he was the one at the bank who had helped her cousin with a truck. He said maybe, because trucks were everywhere and so were cousins, and she said her cousin\u2019s voice had sounded different for a week, more like someone had moved a box off it. He said he was happy to be a box-mover when he could be, and she handed him a bag of tamales he had not deserved and told him not to be silly. Jill caught his eye and raised an eyebrow the way you ask, you okay, and he nodded, because he was increasingly convinced that okay lives in smaller rooms than triumph and is more comfortable furniture.\n\nAt work, a proposal slid across his desk with the kind of friction paper makes when it knows it is loaded. It was for eight townhomes that would look correct in a brochure and very strange on the block where they were planned. The spreadsheet did a little dance his mind could follow with its eyes closed, but down in the notes was a sentence about \u201credevelopment opportunity\u201d that had a scent like someone had left the stove on. He sat with it for an hour, then brought it to his boss, who wore his competence like a pressed shirt, and said he wanted the covenants to require a percentage of units rented below market to people who already lived within two miles or something like that, broad enough to matter and narrow enough to push back on a word he didn\u2019t want to use in a meeting. His boss looked at him like he had suggested moving a river with a spoon and then said they could see, which is a way of saying no that leaves both parties a door.\n\nHe walked down Main at lunch with a sandwich that was smarter than it looked and ran into David, who was carrying a case of bottled water as if it had applied for a job on his back. They sat on a low wall and talked about kids and cooling units and donors who want their name on things and donors who want to be ghosts. Benjamin told him about the townhomes and his idea, and David listened and then said, \u201cIf it keeps two grandmothers near the school they love, I\u2019ll bake you a cake. If it keeps one, I\u2019ll buy you a pie.\u201d Benjamin said he didn\u2019t do it for dessert and David said, \u201cYou better not, my cakes are terrible,\u201d and the joke landed gently because both of them had chosen their rooms on purpose and were trying not to bring furniture that would scratch the floors.\n\nMara sent a picture of a sculpture that looked like a whale\u2019s ribcage and a question about whether it was cruel to show it next to a painting of a thin woman eating air. He wrote back, \u201cCruel to whom,\u201d and she sent a string of emoji that somehow conveyed a lecture shorthand and then wrote, \u201cCome Thursday. There will be speeches I want to mock and also respect, and I need someone to lean into without it becoming a new habit.\u201d He had learned enough to know that sentence had a trapdoor under it, but he said yes anyway like a person who was tired of trying to outsmart his own heart.\n\nHe brought nothing to the opening but himself and the shirt that meant trying. The room glowed with the smug light gallery owners buy in bulk. People used words like \u201cgesture\u201d and \u201cinterrogates\u201d and sometimes they meant them and sometimes they didn\u2019t, and Benjamin found he didn\u2019t mind either outcome as much as he would have three months ago. Mara gave him that whole-faced greeting she reserved for exactly five seconds and then remembered her watch. She placed him beside a man in a denim jacket who introduced himself as a photographer of blue hours, and then she was called away by a woman who said her name like a brand, and he stood and listened to the denim jacket talk about windows and the way glass thinks it is innocent until it knows better.\n\nTom\u00e1s floated near and looked very tired in the way people do when they have spent the day being admired and now have to pretend they are fine with that. He nodded to Benjamin and asked him what he thought of a piece in which wire had been coaxed into something that might be a cage or a cloud, and Benjamin said he was undecided and that was the point he liked best, and Tom\u00e1s\u2019s mouth did a small, unwilling smile that made him look less like an elevator. \u201cShe is good at placing,\u201d Tom\u00e1s said, letting the pronoun work for him, and Benjamin said she was good at many things he wasn\u2019t going to list for someone who already knew, and they stood together feeling civilized and not particularly dangerous.\n\nHe left before the speeches ended and walked home with his tie loosened, his collar attempting to be a person. On his porch he ate one of the tamales he shouldn\u2019t have opened that late at night, the corn coming apart in a way that felt forgiving. He wrote a poem in bad Spanish about wire and weather and what people put near each other to trick themselves into understanding, and the poem was worse than many of his worst and better than some of his better, and he put it away without sending it to anyone. The thunder in the distance sounded like chairs being arranged for a gathering and then put back when the host lost courage.\n\nAt his parents\u2019 house the following Sunday, his mother had a new salad recipe that involved quinoa, a word that still felt like a secret handshake she had said yes to. His father told him a story about when the freeway hadn\u2019t been a fact yet, and Benjamin tried to imagine driving into the city without that river of an assumption. They ate without praying out loud, which still felt like an omission that had to be compensated for with extra politeness. After the peaches, his mother refolded a washcloth with more attention than necessary and asked, with that practiced lilt, if he had seen Sister Evans\u2019s new baby, the one with cheeks like bread. He said he had not and probably would, eventually, and she said, \u201cWell,\u201d and then sat down with a soft thud that meant she was trying a new approach. \u201cYou seem,\u201d she said, and paused because there are words that resist being named in front of the people they belong to, \u201cyou seem a little more yourself lately. I don\u2019t know if I like all of it, and that is my job, but I like that part.\u201d\n\nHe told her about the kids and oranges and the Great Salt Lake as if these were all facets of one item on a receipt he could not return. He told her about writing poems and then never reading them to anyone, and she said, in genuine confusion, why would you do that, and he laughed and said, to be a person, and she said, I thought people read things to each other all the time now, and he said, only the brave and the very drunk, and she made the face of a woman remembering something she would not say out loud and then said, anyway, be careful with what you bring into your mouth. He promised he would, knowing he was lying, and also not.\n\nHe did read once, though. He went to the open mic Jill had sent him the flyer for and stood at the back and reconsidered his life choices and then decided there were worse places to reconsider them. When his name was called\u2014because he had written it down without believing in the future\u2014he walked to the front feeling like a man who had borrowed his own shoes. He read the poem about wire and weather and did not translate it to English because he wanted to honor the part of him that had to strain. He mispronounced one word in a way that made it sound dirtier and better and everyone generously pretended they didn\u2019t notice, and when he looked up he saw Mario\u2019s older sister in the second row with a friend, both of them giving him the same tight-lipped respectful face kids give adults when they are doing something embarrassing well. After, Caleb clapped him on the shoulder and said, \u201cYou made a shape,\u201d and then lit a cigarette as if to undo any sincerity that might linger, and Benjamin went home and did not sleep for a long time but also did not regret.\n\nLate in July, a noise pulled him upright at five in the morning, a sound like a hundred small creatures deciding to move house at once. The bed wobbled, the picture frames looked ashamed, and then it was over. He texted Mara without checking the clock: \u201c\u00bfLo sentiste?\u201d She wrote back: \u201cS\u00ed. Todav\u00eda tiemblo.\u201d He stared at those words until they lost their grammar and became simply a report from someone he wanted to hear breathing. Later that day he met with the developer of the townhomes, a man with a haircut like a promise, and asked for the covenant out loud. The man laughed with his tongue against his teeth and said, he appreciated the sentiment, and Benjamin said, the bank can attach conditions to this credit, and the man shrugged and said, then attach them, and the shrug contained both a dare and a calculation about how much the market would erase what men like Benjamin tried to write. He left the meeting and walked into heat that had nothing to say about any of it and went to the library and read the lines in Sor Juana where a mind refuses to be told what it wants and felt less like an intruder than he had three months ago.\n\nMara called him at midnight two nights later with a voice like a pen that had run out of ink and then found more. She told him that she had told Tom\u00e1s no to something that looked like an opportunity and that his face had done a thing she wished she had not loved noticing. She told him that she had been at a dinner where the forks were heavier than his mortgage and that she had flirted with the idea of being very good at it for a living, and then she had gone home and written a paragraph in Spanish about a girl who watched her mother count bottles on a shelf. He listened and offered the correct minimum and then a little extra, and when she said, \u201cNo me ayudes demasiado,\u201d he said, \u201cEst\u00e1 bien,\u201d and peeled an orange quietly with one hand because his other hand had forgotten it could do more than hold a voice.\n\nHe asked her to come with him to Bountiful to watch the early fireworks and she said not yet, but tell me about the way your mother folds napkins, and he did, and she made a small appreciative sound a person makes when something unexpected turns out to be exactly how they wanted it. He asked her to come with him to the ballpark he and his father had sat in many years ago, the one that still smelled like peanuts and sunscreen and hope no matter the decade, and she said maybe and meant no, and he said okay and meant try again later, and both of them were honest and neither was entirely brave.\n\nThe townhomes did get their covenant, a narrow one, attached like a scarf to a coat that would not have known it was missing anything. His boss looked at him with an expression halfway between amused and pleased and said, \u201cWell, you did a thing,\u201d and Benjamin said, with excessive humility, that he had, and then walked to the center on Tuesday and read about a rabbit who had grown tired of being accused of speed and had decided to take up painting. The children corrected him less and then more, as if to remind him they were paying attention, and Jill handed him a paper cup of water like a sacrament and told him he was stubborn in ways that made him useful and exhausting. He said, \u201cI can change,\u201d and she said, \u201cI hope not,\u201d and the air conditioner decided to be a friend again for fifteen minutes and everyone clapped, because people do.\n\nAugust made itself known with mornings that tasted like metal and afternoons that tasted like dust. The mountains faded and returned in their ritual, and his apartment learned how to be hot without apology. He took to keeping oranges in the fridge and standing with the door open longer than he needed to. He and Mara met at odd hours when her schedule allowed and when her schedule pressed its thumb down on her throat and said hush. Sometimes she was early and they talked about nothing and everything with the giddy competence of people who could pick up a thread without wondering where they had left the spool. Sometimes she was late and he practiced not performing disappointment, and sometimes he failed that test and she let him fail without rewarding it.\n\nOne evening she did say yes to the lake again, and he picked her up without a plan and they drove until the light leaned away. This time the flies were lazier and the air was warmer and the line between water and sky had forgotten to be crisp. They sat, and she told him the story of her father\u2019s first month at the welding shop, how he had burned his hand and not told anyone and gone home and plunged it into a sink and hissed like an animal and her mother had wrapped it in a towel warmed in the dryer and said his name in a way that made it into a sentence with a period and then a dash and then his name again. He told her the story of his almost-mission and how he had packed and then unpacked and how he had learned it was possible to disappoint people and survive and how that didn\u2019t mean he had liked it. She leaned into him for a minute like she was checking if his shoulder was the same as anyone else\u2019s, and then she sat up straight as if she had heard her name called from the water.\n\nHe didn\u2019t kiss her. He thought about it like a person considers stepping onto ice, and then he didn\u2019t, and she noticed not the not-kissing but the way his hand found the rock beside him and made a fist. \u201cYou\u2019re a good man,\u201d she said, and then made a face at herself, and corrected herself, \u201cYou are trying to be,\u201d and he said, \u201cBetter grade,\u201d and they laughed like people who were trying not to give their laughter jobs. On the drive back she fell asleep for seven minutes and he watched the road with that kind of attention that turns your heartbeat into a traffic report, and when she woke up she pretended she hadn\u2019t been asleep and then admitted it immediately, and he said, \u201cEstabas,\u201d and she said, \u201cMuy bien,\u201d and he felt that he had used the imperfect correctly and also the other thing.\n\nToward the end of the month, Tamsin announced a weekend in Park City for a fair that involved art and money and the idea of both in high altitudes. Mara invited him with all her warning bells, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t. But if you do, understand it will be uncomfortable, and I won\u2019t be your anything and you\u2019ll have to watch me be a thing that will make you mad and sad and proud and I don\u2019t know in what order.\u201d He went the first day and wore sunglasses like armor and a shirt he did not care about and watched as people did what they do with weather and funds and taste. He saw Mara move with purpose and sweetness and a practiced disinterest that made her kindness look sharper, and he hated and admired that he loved watching her do it.\n\nOn a balcony that looked over houses whose heated driveways had more technology than the public schools he knew, Mara stood between Tom\u00e1s and Tamsin, listening to a man talk about a sculpture he had no intention of buying with the hunger of a priest hearing confession from a king. She caught Benjamin\u2019s eye for a second and lifted her glass just enough to make it an acknowledgment rather than a request, and he lifted his paper cup of water back and felt like a person who had chosen, for once, the correct modest thing on purpose. Caleb came out of a room, looking like he had gotten lost in a closet full of linen and found himself, and leaned against the railing and read a text and made a face at no one that Benjamin recognized because he had made it too.\n\nOn the drive down the canyon, he didn\u2019t put on music. The headlights ahead of him made a ribbon and someone on a motorcycle caught the late air on their shoulders like a brag they had not earned. He said sentences in the future tense because he wanted to hear the verbs make promises. He said, \u201cIr\u00e9 al centro cada martes,\u201d and tried not to ask what would happen when the snow made the week close in on itself. He said, \u201cHar\u00e9 lo que puedo,\u201d and felt the shape of can in his mouth like a coin that had been in circulation and still had the face on it. He said, very quietly, \u201cTe querr\u00e9 ma\u00f1ana,\u201d and then, because he was trying to do what Mara had told him, he changed it to \u201cTe quiero hoy,\u201d and then he didn\u2019t say it out loud again, because sometimes practice risks becoming a vow before you\u2019ve meant it to, and vows ask to be fed.\n\nAugust ended the way a song ends at a wedding when the DJ has misjudged the crowd. The light lingered a second longer and then packed itself up and drove away. Benjamin stood on his porch one night and watched as his neighbor dragged a fan up the stairs and a woman two houses down yelled into a phone in a language he barely knew and he decided he loved the fact that he barely knew it and could still tell she would forgive the person on the other end if they said the right three words. He peeled an orange, careful, and held the peel to his nose until the oil stung in a way he liked. He thought of the first day at the library and the way Mara had said patient and meant it and the way she had said sliding and looked at him because she knew, and he thought of his father\u2019s hands and his mother\u2019s folding and the brine flies deciding they could be wild for an hour and then going back to work. He thought of peninsulas and causeways and the rooms he walked into now without hating himself for not having the right words.\n\nOn a Tuesday when the air teased rain and then laughed at itself, he arrived at the center with a stack of books and a bag of limes because he had learned something new about how kids will put salt and chili on anything and make it better. Mario had a new haircut that made him look older in the way boys look older when someone else cut their hair in a kitchen. The girl with the tiara had switched to a paper crown and said its weight was different and she wasn\u2019t sure she liked the metaphors people were trying to feed her. They read a book about a house that refused to be demolished because it remembered too many birthdays, and afterward David made a speech about moving the reading hour back when school started and how this meant they would need more volunteers and also more patience. Benjamin raised his hand without meaning to and said, \u201cS\u00ed,\u201d and then repeated it in English even though nobody needed him to, just to make it official to himself.\n\nHe walked home into a wind that had found its humor and stopped in front of the gallery because the door was open and the air made a little current like the room had learned electricity. Mara was there, hair up, neck bare, looking like someone had remembered to tell her she existed. She saw him and came to him and touched his elbow and then let her hand fall, and said, \u201cI sold something today that I didn\u2019t love, and I said no to something I did, and I don\u2019t know if that meant I did it right,\u201d and he said he was proud of her without asking to hear the details, and she leaned her head in toward him without resting it anywhere and said, \u201cYou are very dangerous when you keep your mouth closed,\u201d and he said, \u201cI am practicing,\u201d and she laughed and went back to her counter and he stood in front of a painting of an onion and decided that sometimes performance and sincerity are cousins who have learned to live together without fighting every night.\n\nHe slept later than he should have and woke with a list inside his body of things that would not be written down. He showered and practiced the future again because it was there, and then he walked to the bank and went up to his floor and sat at his desk and looked at the mountains and said to himself in a voice he had started to trust, \u201cHar\u00e9 lo que pueda,\u201d and then he added in English, \u201cand then I\u2019ll do a little more,\u201d and the blinking cursor didn\u2019t look like a heart beating too fast anymore. It looked like a metronome you could either dance to or ignore. He opened the loan package and started reading the notes he had written to himself in a Spanish that had been hard won and found them insufficient in a way that made him want to keep writing them anyway.\n\nAt dusk, he went back to the lake alone, because he wanted to see if it would be different without the pressure of being observed by someone he wanted to impress. It was the same, mean and beautiful and honest, and a boy in a white shirt balanced on a rock and pretended to be a bird while his mother pretended not to see so he could become one without having to explain. The salt was kind to his shoes and cruel to his nose, and he forgave it for both because that is the bargain you make with places that don\u2019t promise you anything. He said out loud, softly, \u201cVoy a seguir,\u201d and let the wind slap the words around a little, and then he drove home with the windows down and the radio off, because he wanted to hear the sound of whatever it was he was building that didn\u2019t yet have walls.\n\nWhen he reached his street, his neighbor was sitting on the stoop with his hands on his knees, looking like a man who had finished a thing and was taking the minute after to acknowledge it. Benjamin sat beside him without asking and they watched a skater carve the same line into the cul-de-sac three times and then fall in a way that would be funny later. The neighbor said, in Spanish, that he had fixed his shower, and Benjamin said, in Spanish, that this meant he had conquered a small god, and the neighbor laughed like a man who had earned his water. Somewhere beyond them, fireworks warmed up without permission, and the first little pop sounded like someone trying to make a point politely. He thought of how he would tell Mara that sound and what tense it would demand, and then he decided to wait and find out from her mouth. He had learned this much: to count his verbs like coins and spend them on something other than himself, or at least try.\n\nHe went to bed with Sor Juana on his chest and woke up hours later with the book on the floor and the lights still on, and for once he didn\u2019t punish himself for not being perfect. He made bad eggs and ate them and laughed at himself the way he had promised he wouldn\u2019t, and then he sent a message to Mara that said, \u201cTraigo limes. T\u00fa traes la paciencia,\u201d and then another to Jill that said, \u201cPuedo estar los jueves,\u201d and then he stood at his sink with cold water running and let the ache in his chest be a liveable ache. He was not brave and he was not cowardly. He was a man who had begun, and he had decided, with all due arrogance, to continue.Chapter 7\n\nSeptember arrived like a door closing softly and then reopening to check it had not caught anyone\u2019s hand. The heat let go without apologizing, the mornings turned rinsed and thin, and the mountains put their edges back on. The city began to smell of cut lawns trying one more time and classrooms waking up. At the center, Jill moved the reading hour to that fragile space after school and before dinner, and the kids came in with hair damp from drinking fountains and the specific wildness of children who have kept their bodies in chairs all day and now want to remember they have knees. Benjamin learned how to read quickly and then pause on purpose, learned how to say, in Spanish, \u201cWe will finish on the next page,\u201d and mean it like a promise and a bribe at once. When he left in the dusky light, the air felt loose again on his skin and he loved the way his car\u2019s engine sounded guilty when it started.\n\nAt the bank the quarter-end rituals assembled themselves and then demanded performance. Spreadsheets announced their modest heroics, memos cleared their throats, and a committee decided, in the tone of men choosing hymn numbers, what would be delayed. The townhomes with the narrow covenant returned to his desk in a folder that had acquired fingerprints like a bad secret. The developer came in wearing a jacket that knew it was supposed to be impressive and called Benjamin principled in the way people call you difficult when they intend to be civilized. Benjamin smiled and did not perform humility. After, he took the elevator down to the street and stood with a burrito too hot to hold and watched a group of boys in football jerseys push a sled down the sidewalk yelling in unison, their voices loud enough to talk back to the sky. He thought of covenants like thin stitches and wondered which of them would hold when the fabric pulled.\n\nMara\u2019s messages shifted, then thinned, like a radio wheeling past stations between songs. She sent him a photograph of a crate of pears labeled with a name she knew he would find unreasonably pretty and asked him how to say bruise without making it sound poetic. He sent her a paragraph about bruises anyway, and then the correct word. When he asked if they were on for Tuesday, she wrote that a collector had scheduled a studio visit and her boss had scheduled an event and she had scheduled herself into a pretzel. He typed three versions of a reply and chose the one that said, in Spanish, est\u00e1 bien, nos vemos cuando puedes, which was either saintly or passive depending on what day it reached you. The following afternoon she wrote, Let\u2019s keep the lessons, let\u2019s keep them where they are, not more, not less, and he felt the sentence land on his back like a hand that meant to comfort and also meant to remind him of posture.\n\nOn a Sunday he walked into the back of a chapel where the hymnals had soft covers and the announcements were in two languages. An usher with a kindness that preceded his smile handed him a program and didn\u2019t ask him anything at all. He sat near the door like a man who might need to leave without making a scene and listened to a hymn he knew sung in a language he was trying to deserve. He found that the chords were the same and the vowels were not, and that his chest remembered what to do. When the sacrament tray came to him he passed it on and did not take, and the boy holding it glanced at him with the professionalism of a child doing a job and then looked away without any theater. Outside, after, he stood under a tree whose leaves had decided to make a plan and watched families fit themselves back into minivans. He said to himself, in a whisper he believed he had earned, I would come back here, and then he walked home the long way past a park where two men argued over a chessboard and made each other better.\n\nThe kids at the center wrote stories in September because Jill said the city felt like a pencil and you should always listen to the weather. Mario wrote about a rabbit who put on a backpack and went to school and learned he didn\u2019t have to race every day, only sometimes, and only when it mattered. The girl with the tiara, who had retired crowns in favor of a pink eraser she used as a worry stone, wrote about a fox who wanted to be a librarian and had to bargain with three owls and a landlord. Benjamin sat at a small table and explained the conditional, which felt exactly like teaching someone to plan escape routes with the lights on. He wrote on the board si fuera, har\u00eda, and the kids cheered because the letter j in har\u00eda sounded like making trouble without getting caught. He told them about wishes that start with ojal\u00e1 and which ones deserve to be said out loud, and when he said ojal\u00e1 que llueva paletas, they yelled like he had become briefly good at his job.\n\nWhen his father called on a Tuesday morning and left a message that said only, \u201cCall me,\u201d Benjamin felt his bones step into a line and salute. In the emergency room the lights made everyone look like they had been asked a question they couldn\u2019t answer yet. His father sat on a bed with wires attending to him like attentive nephews and said he had scared his own chest by taking the trash to the curb and back too fast. His mother stood with her purse angled like a small shield. A nurse with eyes that understood men who wanted to make jokes when they were afraid asked if anyone needed a blanket, and Benjamin wanted to tell her yes and then wanted to say he was fine and then finally said, to the nurse and to his mother, s\u00ed, por favor. In the waiting area, a woman tried to explain in Spanish that her son had swallowed a coin and was sorry, he was sorry, he hadn\u2019t meant to, and the receptionist couldn\u2019t hear past the window. Benjamin stepped forward and said, despacio, soy de aqu\u00ed y puedo ayudar un poco, and his mother turned and watched him translate apology to fact and fear to waiting, and later in the car she said, in the quiet voice of a woman practicing something new, that she was proud he had stayed.\n\nHis father went home with a new pill schedule and a reprimand that was really an invitation to be tender with himself. Benjamin slept badly for a week, his own heart practicing outcomes in the dark. He wrote a poem and then tore it in half and then taped it back together and laughed, which felt like progress. He texted Mara something small and true and she answered with a storm of museum acronyms and then, after a minute, with a single clear line: I forget to eat when I am supposed to talk for a living. He wanted to come to the gallery with a sandwich as if he were the solution, and instead he sent a photograph of his father\u2019s pill organizer in the most flattering light he could find, which was the way the afternoon falls onto laminate with more generosity than laminate has earned.\n\nTom\u00e1s found him in a coffee shop that had decided to be serious about beans and laid his catalog down on the table like a court document. He asked, with the brightness of a polite trap, if Benjamin had seen the review, and when Benjamin said he had not, Tom\u00e1s summarized a paragraph in which the show\u2019s restraint saved it from itself and then raised his eyebrows as if asking the world to behave. He said, conversationally, that the gallery had put in for a fair in L.A. and that if they were accepted it would change the pace of the season, and that Mara was very good at pace, and Benjamin said he knew, and Tom\u00e1s\u2019s mouth made a shape that meant he knew Benjamin knew. They talked about weather even though both of them understood they were not.\n\nOne late afternoon the city tried out its first inversion of the year like a sweater it had forgotten was itchy. The sky lowered itself with an air of resignation and the air decided to taste like the memory of toast. From his office window the Oquirrhs retired into rumor and the Wasatch looked like the idea of a mountain and not the thing. He rode the elevator down with a woman who worked two floors below and wore her lanyard like penance, and they both pretended not to breathe shallow, and then they both breathed shallow anyway. At the bottom, the street smelled like engines and the angle of light was such that everybody looked briefly like a person he loved. He walked to the library because it had become, over the last months, the place he went when he wanted to remember there were rooms that made promises and kept them.\n\nMara had canceled their lesson that afternoon with a phrase that was both apology and boundary. He sat by a window anyway and read Sor Juana until his eyes felt properly admonished. Then he took out the small notebook he had bought for poems and budgeting, as if he could trick himself into believing both tasks were practical, and wrote a letter to Mara that he did not intend to send. He told her about the woman in the ER with the coin and the way the boy had looked guilty and pleased at having swallowed money, as if he had been told his whole life that coins are powerful and had decided to test it. He told her about the conditional and how the kids ate it like candy, and how he wanted to learn the subjunctive not to be clever but to deserve wishes. He wrote about wanting correctly and he wrote, I will not ask you to make me a future, and then he crossed it out and then he drew an arrow to it to make sure he would see it later. He closed the notebook and let the underside of his wrist rest on the cool table until he could feel his pulse declaring itself a normal citizen.\n\nJill texted him a flyer with too many fonts for a reading and zine release at Mestizo and asked if he would read the poem he hadn\u2019t shown anyone. He wrote back, absolutely not, and then, because she knew how to aim, she sent a photograph of Mario holding a stapled booklet like a trophy and said, he is reading, and then he was ashamed of himself and said yes and then put his phone face down as if that would help. On the night of the reading the room felt like a general store for thoughts. People stood and bought coffee they didn\u2019t need and told each other about the weather as if they were going to fix it. He waited his turn and read in Spanish first, not because he was brave but because he needed the mercy of straining. His voice didn\u2019t shake because it had too much to do, and when he looked up he saw Mara near the door, hair down, arms crossed in a way that kept her from hugging herself. She smiled with her eyes like a person who has decided to be impressed on purpose. After, she told him the poem had a clean line and a necessary clumsiness. He said, thank you, and also, I didn\u2019t know you were coming, and she said, who do you think told Jill to ask you, and he laughed and felt a small heat behind his eyes and looked at the ceiling and counted the tiles like a man pretending he didn\u2019t know what to do with gratitude.\n\nThey walked outside and stood in the glow of a streetlight that remembered moths. She told him the gallery would be going to Los Angeles for a week and that between now and then everything would be performed twice, once for practice and once for money. She told him she had applied to a graduate program with an application that had asked her to write the same essay she had been writing in different rooms since she was nineteen and that she hated herself for wanting the yes and she hated herself for wanting to be the person who could say no to the yes. He told her that if she left, he would keep going to the center and he would keep listening in line at the market and he would keep reading aloud to a room full of children who would someday decide for themselves whether they wanted to be kind. She put her palm briefly against the center of his chest like a person checking if a machine was on. He did not reach for her hand. He stood still and gave her the steadiness she had requested months ago without knowing it. She said, quietly, you make a room where I can hear myself, and he said, then let that be the room, and she smiled in relief and a little grief and said, you are too good at this, and he said, not yet.\n\nAt his parents\u2019 house, his father\u2019s pill organizer now sat next to the salt the way a tool lives among condiments when it has been told it is part of the daily table. His mother had learned to let the kitchen be a gentle assembly line instead of an institution. After dinner she handed him a stack of plates and said, in Spanish without announcing it, t\u00fa lavas, yo seco, and he answered, est\u00e1 bien, and they did these simple things in another language and nobody made a moment out of it. Later, his father told him the story of when the refinery had blown a flame so high the boys had written their initials in soot on the sidewalk and thought they were making history, and Benjamin listened and asked, is there a part of the story you never tell, and his father looked toward the back door where the lawn waited and said, sometimes I leave out the parts where I was scared, and Benjamin said, you can put them back in, and his father nodded at the air like a man who might.\n\nThe gallery\u2019s Los Angeles week came on like weather. Mara sent him photographs of crates and freight elevators and the back-of-house rooms where the walls are beige and concrete and the art looks like it is waiting to be introduced to its mask. She wrote him a message from an airless convention space at midnight that said, my feet are filing a formal complaint, and he wrote back, voy a presentar una demanda en su nombre, and she wrote, no seas rid\u00edculo, and then, gracias, and he put his phone on the table next to the bowl of oranges and went to wash his face with water as cold as a decision. For seven days he did not see her and it was like learning a new breath. He did not text Jill to ask for news; he did not go online to look for photographs of people being the kind of people you can recognize from a distance. He read to the kids about a house that had grown tired of standing still and put wheels under itself, and when he mispronounced ladrillos, Mario said it with him out loud without making a scene.\n\nWhen Mara came back she looked like a person who had been admired long and asked to be useful in ways she did not yet have words for. They met at the library because neither of them trusted anywhere else. She spread her notebook on the table like a card game and said, future, conditional, subjunctive, all in the same hour, like showing him a hill and saying they would stroll it. He told her that he had already cheated on the subjunctive and she laughed and said, everyone does, like a bishop forgiving a harmless vice. She wrote, quiero que, dudo que, ojal\u00e1 que, and they played with the things you can say only when you admit you are not in charge. He said, quiero que te cuides, and she blinked once as if something had moved in the room, and then she said, yo tambi\u00e9n, quiero que te cuides, and they let that be a sentence without asking it to be a vow.\n\nHe invited her to dinner with his parents and she said not yet and then wrote, tell me about your mother\u2019s napkins again, and he drew them for her on a paper towel, the pattern she favored, the way she folded corners under to make the square exact. She invited him to a small thing, not a gala, a fundraiser in a church basement for a program that placed books in laundromats, and he said, yes, and discovered that in rooms like that people gave you money not because you had asked artfully but because your face was familiar. He wrote a check with his careful banker hand and did not apologize to his future for the subtraction. He watched a toddler sit on the floor and read a book upside down with the concentration of a surgeon and felt his throat go tight and then relax because sometimes gratitude arrives like a helpful stranger and sometimes it arrives like a cough you can\u2019t get rid of and either way it leaves you better.\n\nThe inversion came down in earnest in October and sat on their shoulders like a teacher with a grudge. After two days of chewing the air, everyone stopped being brave about it and started sounding like a chorus of bad clarinets. He swam at Steiner because the water felt rude in a way he needed. He read a bilingual book in the hot tub and a man next to him said, without malice, so you\u2019re the guy who\u2019s always studying, and he said, sometimes, and the man said, good, and then they both stared at the clock like they were taunting it. He drove to the lake one afternoon because he wanted to see if there was a horizon left, and there was, flatter, meaner, and beautiful as a rebuke.\n\nAt the center, Jill introduced a new volunteer, a woman with a braid down her back and the certainty of someone who had taught third grade in a town that did not get its fair share of streetlights. Benjamin stepped back to let her lead and then stepped forward to remind a boy he liked that he could say por favor without diminishing himself. David had put a bulletin board up with the kids\u2019 first lines, and the sentences, in both languages, made the far wall look like it had decided to become a mouth. Mario wrote, a veces quisiera ser una bicicleta, and then he crossed out quisiera and wrote quiero, and Benjamin didn\u2019t correct him. He stood and grinned at the board like an idiot and then pretended he had been invited to check the thermostat.\n\nNovember colored the foothills and then took the color away with the economy of a landlord. Mara\u2019s graduate program sent a letter that was not a letter, only instructions about calling a portal something else, and she looked at the screen and then at him and said, if they say no, I will be fine, and if they say yes, I will be problematic. He said, I will be here either way, and then tried to soften it with a joke about how his sink had improved its water pressure, but the sentence had already done what sentences do when they arrive in the world wanting to be true. She looked at him with affection and with worry, which is to say she looked at him like a person.\n\nHe drove to Bountiful for Thanksgiving with the pie he hadn\u2019t made and stood at the sink with his mother and learned a new fold, the one for the cloth that sits under the rolls, and she told him that the boy who had swallowed a coin had swallowed another and his mother had told him, you can\u2019t keep money that way, and he had laughed and not cried because he was seven. They watched football and pretended the men on the screen were heroes and then they watched his father sleep with his mouth open like a boy and decided not to say anything. In the evening he stood on the porch with his coat unbuttoned and the air did the kindness of not being ambitious, and he said to himself, in the language he had chosen, seguir\u00e9, and then, in the other one, I will keep doing this until I am done.\n\nWhen snow finally came it did not ask for permission. It took the city\u2019s edges and made them honest. The lake took the snow into its mouth and changed nothing about itself, which felt like a lesson he didn\u2019t yet understand. He met Mara at the library with their cheeks reddened and their ears complaining and she said, subjunctive again, because winter demands grammar. They wrote down sentences about wishing and fearing and hoping and doubting, the four corners you pin a life to when you cannot be certain, and she said, I hope you don\u2019t make yourself small for anyone, and he said, I doubt I could if I tried, and then he added, but I worried once that I would, and then he corrected it to the past perfect to prove he could. She laughed and said, I regret teaching you to make elegance out of sadness, and he said, we would have found it anyway.\n\nOn a night so cold it made cellophane of the sky, he walked past the gallery and saw through the glass at an angle that made the inside look like a place it had never been. Mara stood by the counter with Tom\u00e1s and another woman, and she was animated in a way that could have been joy and could have been strategy and was probably both. He stood outside long enough to be uncomfortable and then left before discomfort could shape his mouth into something untrue. At home he wrote a list of things he wanted with grammar that felt honest. Quiero leer bien. Quiero ayudar sin pedir aplausos. Quiero amar sin pedir recibo. He looked at the list and didn\u2019t ask it to be otherwise.\n\nWhen Jill texted to ask if he could cover reading on a day snow had made cowardly, he said yes without making it sound like a favor. The kids straggled in like birds who had discovered winter is not a rumor. He read them a story about a woman who didn\u2019t know what to do with a gift and decided to keep it unwrapped until it told her, and the kids shifted like they were deciding whether to trust him. At the end, Mario raised his hand and said, in Spanish, that sometimes not opening something is the bravest way to keep it, and Benjamin looked at him with something sharper than pride and said, in the same language, that sometimes you open it and find a smaller box inside and that is a joke you can decide to like. They laughed together as if the joke were sufficient.\n\nHe walked home in snow that fizzed and thought about the coming year\u2019s verbs. The future, still arrogant. The conditional, still tender. The subjunctive, an acre he had bought with sweat and was learning to plant. He thought of Mara and did not rehearse a confession. He thought of his parents and did not rehearse a defense. He thought of the lake, petty and sublime, and did not rehearse forgiveness. In his apartment he peeled an orange whose skin resisted and decided resistance is one way love recognizes itself. He ate over the sink and said ojal\u00e1 out loud, and then he laughed at himself for liking the sound of his own hope, and he did it again anyway, because if language has taught him anything, it is that you are allowed to repeat what saves you.Chapter 8\n\nDecember whitened the city in a way that didn\u2019t apologize for the mess it made afterward. The first storm came overnight with the serious quiet of a man doing arithmetic and in the morning the world had been cut into simpler shapes. Snow made good neighbors of roofs and made every car into a declaration of character\u2014brushed clean with pride or left sullen under a crust. The inversion rode in on the storm\u2019s coat tails and stayed, the sky going from confession to erasure in an afternoon. From his office, the Wasatch returned only as rumor. He could feel the air sitting on his chest like an uncle who had always meant well and never learned when to stand.\n\nAt the laundromat on 600 North, the air was warm and damp and smelled like pennies and laundry soap that had not been measured with precision. A folding table had been repurposed into a bookshelf and then into an altar of sorts. Someone had taped paper stars to a wall in a way that made them look like they were trying to climb without drawing attention. A hand-lettered sign read Libros gratis/Free Books in a script that had practiced being friendly. Jill had scrounged a string of lights and draped them above the machines and now they buzzed like they had opinions. He stood awkwardly with a tote full of picture books and a bag of clementines because oranges were too big for small hands that also had to hold quarters.\n\nThey were doing a posada, Jill had said, without ceremony. Not a reenactment so much as a translation. Las Posadas in a laundromat meant children with paper lanterns taped to fiberglass rods and songs sung on key and off down aisles of tumbling towels and a woman at machine four crying a little into the shoulder of her coat because the words had surprised her. He knew the English carols of his childhood down to the muscle memory of the way his throat tightened on certain chords, and now he held a thin stapled booklet and tried to find his way into pide posada with a mouth that wanted\u2014more and more these days\u2014the permission grammar gave him. Jill looked at him from across the room as if to say, this is both more and less complicated than we think.\n\nThe first door was a dryer with a sign that said NO VENT THIS ONE, and the boy who had once retired from racing rabbits knocked anyway with the seriousness of a man at a threshold. The verses passed back and forth, the inside voices saying there is no room and the children\u2019s small chorus insisting until a final verse opened the door, and the mothers laughed and wiped their eyes and somebody\u2019s aunt hummed a harmony that made strangers look at one another as if they had been introduced. He sang the part that asked and felt the asking settle into him. D\u00e9me posada felt like admitting you would be hungry later; \u00e1branos, like telling the truth about your fear of being outside. A little girl with a paper crown asked if he was the posadero or the peregrino and he said, \u201cA veces, los dos,\u201d and she nodded like this was obvious, then turned to tell a baby in a car seat a secret with a solemnity that made him want to own a lemon tree just so he could hand her fruit.\n\nAfterward, while children compared stickers as if they had been paid in stamps for bravery, a woman with hair tied back in a scarf the color of persimmons asked him in Spanish if he worked at the bank on Main. When he said he did, she told him her rent had gone up again and her landlord had replaced the mailbox locks with a smile that had not been friendly. He felt the part of him that measured risk and the part of him that counted apples collide. \u201cHay programas,\u201d he said carefully, aware of the way programs can disgust themselves with their own names, \u201cy puedo preguntar,\u201d and she looked at him with both hope and the exact amount of skepticism hope should come with these days, and said, \u201cPregunte. Y regrese.\u201d He said he would, and for once he did not feel like a man making a promise just to hear himself sound good.\n\nMara texted a photograph of a page with the imperative commands circled in three colors, the circles messy in a way that told him she had been thinking with a pen and not with a plan. ven, dime, qu\u00e9date sat there like words that were either a game or a dare. The caption read, \u201cMandatos. Dangerous. Useful.\u201d He wrote back, \u201cNo me des \u00f3rdenes,\u201d and she sent a row of clapping hands and then, \u201cS\u00e9 valiente.\u201d He wrote, \u201cEstoy practicando,\u201d and felt, again, the ease of saying something as a verb and not a vow.\n\nThey met at the library with their cheeks red from the walk and their hands cold in the way that makes hot coffee seem medicinal rather than decadent. She spread a notebook and wrote two columns: t\u00fa and usted, and he groaned like a door that needed oil. \u201cThis is where you practice affection and respect without confusing them,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere do you use formal? Where do you use you-you?\u201d He said at work he wanted you all to be formal until he heard someone call the receptionist \u201cmija\u201d and understood he had entered a family meeting. She said, \u201cTell me to sit,\u201d and he said, \u201cSi\u00e9ntate, por favor,\u201d and she sat with exaggerated obedience and then told him to stand\u2014p\u00e1rate\u2014and he stood and then stayed standing because suddenly standing felt like his job.\n\nThey made themselves laugh with \u201cponte el su\u00e9ter\u201d and \u201cno comas eso\u201d and she told him how her grandmother had turned the imperative into a love language and how sometimes the only way to say I see you and I want you to stay is to hand someone a coat and say, \u201cP\u00f3ntelo.\u201d He turned that over in his mouth and tasted his mother of late saying \u201cpon una olla, mijito,\u201d as if inviting him to cook were a way of inviting him to remain a son. He wrote down \u201ccu\u00eddate\u201d and circled it and she noticed and pretended not to, then noticed that she was pretending and rolled her eyes at herself.\n\nThe bank\u2019s year-end required a particular theater. There were cookies at reception with the company colors in frosting and a memo that said Thank You in a tone that could not help sounding managerial. His boss called him into a conference room that always felt like a waiting room in a nice hospital and told him that there was a vice president title in January if he wanted to carry that particular weight. It came with a raise that would be meaningful to any budget that had a margin and with more meetings where the word risk would be asked to wear a tie. He said he would think about it and meant it, not as a performance of humility but as a man who had learned that adding letters to your business card can sometimes subtract something else. In the elevator afterward, a coworker congratulated him as if the decision had already decided itself, and Benjamin heard himself say \u201cgracias\u201d and then, because he had started showing up to rooms in two languages, he said \u201cthank you,\u201d and the coworker looked at him curious, then bored, then said something about skiing and got off on two.\n\nHe went home to an apartment that smelled like damp wool and made a pot of beans with more devotion than skill, adding bay leaves as if they were the difference between nourished and merely fed. He peeled a clementine and placed the peels on the edge of the counter in a spiral because sometimes arranging the world into shapes was the only kind of control anybody deserved. He wrote a list of debts, not financial; the people he owed oranges to, the rooms that had given him a place to be a beginner, the voices that had corrected him without humiliating him. He wrote Jill\u2019s name and David\u2019s and Mario\u2019s and his mother\u2019s and, after a long pause, Mara\u2019s, and then he said out loud like a prayer without being one, \u201cP\u00e1guenme con paciencia,\u201d and laughed at himself for making even love an accounting problem, and then didn\u2019t take it back.\n\nThe next storm got stuck over the valley like a decision you refuse to make because making it will cost you something. The city gathered snow in the corners of its mouth, then smiled and dropped it in clotted piles. He walked to Rancho with a scarf his mother had knitted when he was twenty-one and certain he would not need a scarf for a life lived indoors. The bakery case had conchas that looked like the idea of winter had sat down and stopped trying to be elegant. He bought a bag of pan dulce and two pounds of oranges because oranges were still his offering, and on the way home he saw a man on a ladder at a storefront on State, hanging a wooden sign that said Zapater\u00eda, and he thought about all the ways people tell you where to knock.\n\nMara\u2019s cough came through in a voice note like a person arguing with a door that won\u2019t open. \u201cEstoy enferma,\u201d she said, and then translated, as was their habit, \u201cI am sick,\u201d and then corrected herself, \u201cTengo una gripe. It has me,\u201d and he said, \u201cVoy,\u201d before asking himself whether he had been given permission to use the imperative on his own heart. He went anyway, with a grocery bag that made him feel more like a man playing a role than a hero. Her building\u2019s hallway smelled like last week\u2019s deliveries and the radiator that had decided to be a river. She opened the door in socks and a sweater that had learned to droop where it mattered. Her hair was half of something and her eyes were the kind of bright you don\u2019t ask compliments from.\n\n\u201cI brought food you will not like,\u201d he said at the threshold, because humor was their best boundary. \u201cAnd tea that will be wrong. And a magazine with pictures of houses you will mock.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will mock them kindly,\u201d she said, then turned and coughed in a way that made his chest answer. \u201cEntra,\u201d she said, and the word felt as old as all the doors he had wanted to be let through.\n\nHe made a caldo that was both soup and apology, standing in a kitchen where the knives were honest and the sink remembered other men. He cut carrots into quarters because halves felt like cheating and added a whole onion because Sor Juana had taught him to respect certain spirits. She lay on the couch under a blanket too thin to be proud and watched him the way people watch a movie they always suspected they would like. \u201cNo me mandes,\u201d she said when he handed her tea and he said, \u201cT\u00f3mate esto,\u201d and she made a face and drank and did not forgive him. He sat at the far end of the couch like a guest with good intentions and bad sense.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be here,\u201d she said finally, gently, with the outline of a smile. \u201cThat is to say, thank you. And don\u2019t get sick. And don\u2019t be the kind of man who thinks soup is a romance plot.\u201d He raised his hands like a thief caught without loot. \u201cMe quedo en la cocina,\u201d he said. \u201cSoy \u00fatil y mudo.\u201d She laughed, then said, \u201cNadie es mudo,\u201d and he nodded because she was right, and because he wanted to be the kind of man who knew when wanting to be necessary was not the same as being necessary.\n\nHe left before midnight and shoveled her steps because the snow had made itself a moral, and tucked a note under the salt by her door that said, in his careful script, \u201cEstoy al lado si necesitas una medicina o palabras o silencio,\u201d and drew a small orange that looked like a planet with a stem. In the morning she sent a photo of the drawing with a laugh-cry emoji and the command, \u201cDuerme,\u201d and he did for once, like a person for whom sleep is not an adversary.\n\nHis father\u2019s breath had settled back into its routine as if it had never considered striking, and yet Benjamin found himself rehearsing phone calls in his head. He went up to Bountiful with salt for the steps and batteries for the radio that nobody used anymore and stood in the driveway with his father as they applied practical knowledge to snow. There is a way men lean on their shovels that is not posing but does not entirely avoid it. \u201cWe should hire someone,\u201d his father said after a minute, and Benjamin said, \u201cI\u2019ll come,\u201d and his father said, \u201cYou can\u2019t always,\u201d and Benjamin said, \u201cI know,\u201d and they stood inside that fact together without trying to make it smaller. Inside, his mother taught him another fold, the napkin for holidays, the one shaped like a little mountain that sits up on the plate as if to say ceremony is not evil.\n\nAt work he brought the rent increase to a colleague whose job was labeled with a word that had the right vowels and not enough teeth. \u201cWe have a small fund,\u201d she said, tucking hair behind her ear as if an idea might fall out. \u201cTiny. Less than a sports car. We can do a one-time assistance if they meet three criteria and the moon does a trick.\u201d He took the form without hating it because hating forms had never filled a pantry. He sat with the woman at the laundromat later that week, watched her read the list, watched her not ask whether the assistance was taking a picture of her or making a door. \u201cRegrese,\u201d she said softly to him when they were done, as much an invitation as an instruction. He thought about the road between a bank and a life and how thin it often is.\n\nMestizo hosted a reading where the room smelled like coffee and wet wool and good nerves. Mario stood at the microphone on a stool taller than his sense of danger and read a story about a bicycle that refused to carry anyone who called it \u201cmy\u201d anything. The room applauded because it was both charming and ruthless. Caleb came late and sat on the floor and read a poem that moved like a man late for a bus and only at the end admitted it was about his mother. Benjamin stood in back and found himself wanting to touch shoulders of strangers when certain lines landed, an instinct he honored by keeping his hands in his pockets. When Mara came she stood near him without taking his arm and said, \u201cYou look good among people,\u201d and he said, \u201cI am trying to be one,\u201d and she said, \u201cIt shows,\u201d which is the kind of sentence somebody saves for when they want to be fair.\n\nShe told him after, outside, breath visible and inconvenient, that she had heard from one school and they had said yes. She said it like a weather report she wanted to be wrong about and craved at the same time. The yes glowed between them for a second, an object neither of them quite knew how to pick up safely. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said, and meant it in the way a person means a thing that will cost them. \u201cWhat will you do,\u201d he asked like a student trying out a construction, and she said, \u201cNo s\u00e9,\u201d and then corrected herself the way she taught him to, \u201cEstoy pensando,\u201d and tucked her hands into her sleeves like a girl trying to make this winter pass with fewer scrapes.\n\nHe walked home with the yes in his pocket like a coin he was afraid he\u2019d spend by accident. He made a note to himself in his careful ledger of the heart: do not make the yes about you. He wrote it twice and circled it. The next morning he went to the gallery and stood in front of a small painting of a kitchen in winter and tried to see what she saw when she hung it as if she were telling a person where to stand. Tom\u00e1s floated by and said the acceptance would look good on the website and Benjamin said, because he couldn\u2019t keep himself from it, \u201cIt will look good in her life,\u201d and Tom\u00e1s said, \u201cThat, too,\u201d as if those two things sometimes take turns.\n\nOn a Sunday he went with his parents to a bilingual sacrament meeting because his mother had heard the music was lively and because his father\u2019s doctor had said church was good for a heart if you knew how to sit. He took the bread in his hand and passed it and felt how his mouth had learned to make the words that went with the ritual even when he didn\u2019t say them out loud. After, a man he recognized from the laundromat nodded at him with the dignity of a neighbor in a new room. His mother asked on the way out if he could teach her how to say \u201cIt is cold\u201d the way her friend\u2019s granddaughter said it, and he said, \u201cHace fr\u00edo,\u201d and she said it twice and then said, \u201cTengo,\u201d and he said, \u201cYou can have it too,\u201d and she looked at him like he had given her a new towel for a job she was still doing.\n\nSnow made its old rituals and the city obliged by moving more slowly. He sat at his desk at the bank and looked at the vice president title on an email and said to himself, in Spanish because it kept him honest, \u201cNo te agrandes si no te cabe,\u201d and grinned because he had taught himself to joke in a language that had taken effort. He checked the box marked yes to the title because saying no would have been a performance today, and then he wrote his own list of imperatives on a sticky note and put it on the edge of his monitor where he could not avoid the shape of his promises. S\u00e9 amable. No te inventes h\u00e9roes. Aprende despacio. Pregunta m\u00e1s. No des discursos que nadie te pidi\u00f3. Aplaude a otros. Lleva naranjas. The last one made him laugh, then sober up, because he had seen how oranges turned into something else when handed at the right door.\n\nHe took Mara to see the lake in winter because he wanted her to have that horizon before she decided which one she would live with next. The causeway had become a necessary straight line under a sky that had decided to be glass. The brine had stitched a lace of ice along the edge where the water argued with itself. The gulls made a sound that was like laughter and warning at once. They walked carefully, shoes finding the places their bodies trusted. She wrapped her scarf higher and he did not offer his arm because there is a way you can over-announce your intentions and ruin the very good you meant. \u201cI might go,\u201d she said, looking at a line that had never cared for human verbs. \u201cI might not. If I stay, I don\u2019t want it to be because I was afraid. If I go, I don\u2019t want it to be because I wanted to be above anyone.\u201d He nodded at the lake like it could take dictation. \u201cTe sigo,\u201d he said, then corrected himself because this was not that, \u201cTe apoyo.\u201d She turned and considered him the way people look at a place to check if it has become familiar. \u201cAp\u00f3yate, too,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that one.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t kiss her. The sentence had stopped feeling like a test and started feeling like a practice. Her shoulder touched his sleeve and then left and neither of them made that human mistake of narrating every contact like an omen. On the drive back, they counted the number of people who had decided to try the ice and then made bets about which ones would turn back, and she was right more often and he forgave her for being right nothing at all needed forgiving. He dropped her at the gallery and she pointed at his chest like a doctor checking a pulse and said, \u201cCu\u00eddate,\u201d and he said, \u201cT\u00fa tambi\u00e9n,\u201d and they both heard the imperative as a handshake and not a leash.\n\nAt the center, the kids returned in boots and complaints and puddles. Jill made a chart about verbs of weather for fun and was delighted when no one else thought this was fun. Benjamin wrote \u201cnevar\u201d across the top like a prophecy. They read a book about an umbrella that did not belong to anyone and therefore belonged to everyone and Mario declared that he was now in favor of public libraries for umbrellas, and Jill clapped like a seal at a new trick because she has always loved the small sentences that are really a country. After, a volunteer he didn\u2019t know well asked him if he ever said prayers anymore and he said, \u201cA veces,\u201d and then, because this had become his habit, he translated for himself, \u201cSometimes,\u201d and didn\u2019t hate the version of himself who could live in sometimes.\n\nOn a night in late December he stood with his parents on a driveway holding cups of something both hot and bland while neighbors set off fireworks because the year had decided it wanted applause on its way out. His father, unsolicited, put a hand on his shoulder and left it there for a count that mattered. His mother leaned against the doorframe and watched the sky do its noisy small-time imitation of God and said, in Spanish without making a fuss, \u201cTen cuidado,\u201d and he said, \u201cSiempre,\u201d and then, because he was trying to be precise and not dramatic, he added, \u201cLo intento.\u201d In his apartment later he wrote his resolutions as if they were commands a gentle commander could give. S\u00e9 exacto con tu ternura. No traduzcas a la gente para tu poema si no te dieron permiso. No prometas lo que no es tuyo. Habla m\u00e1s despacio. No digas que no sabes si s\u00ed sabes. Di no cuando toca. Pide posada cuando est\u00e1s afuera. He set the paper down and put a clementine on top of it like a paperweight from another country.\n\nNew Year\u2019s Day was the kind of morning Salt Lake sometimes gives you as a dare: brittle and blue and so clear you felt you could read your own thoughts if you stood still and didn\u2019t cloud them by speaking. He went to the pool and swam in water that was a scolding and a kindness, counted laps in Spanish because one, two, three had started to feel like a life he kept around for when he wanted to be who he had been. Tres, cuatro, cinco, he said under his breath, and understood how mouths learn to make a life because they get tired of not. In the hot tub afterward, a man told a story in a slow drawl about a truck that wouldn\u2019t start and then the man said the other man had prayed on the hood and the truck started and Benjamin said, \u201cQu\u00e9 bueno,\u201d before he remembered this wasn\u2019t one of the rooms where he had earned the right to speak in Spanish, and the man didn\u2019t blink, just grinned and said, \u201cYeah,\u201d and for a second all the rooms felt like one.\n\nA week later the vice president title sat on his email and did not make a sound, and he accepted it with the practical sense that sometimes the way to hold your shape in a system is to take a chair at the table and keep your accent. He went to the laundromat and told the woman with the persimmon scarf that the fund could pay a part of one month and help with the old past-due if she didn\u2019t mind three signatures and a photograph of her mailbox, and she breathed out through her nose as if she had been holding her breath through a small tunnel and said, \u201cBueno,\u201d and he said, \u201cNo es suficiente,\u201d and she said, \u201cPara hoy, s\u00ed,\u201d and then handed him a Tupperware of cookies and told him not to be dramatic.\n\nThe acceptance from the second school came in an envelope that did not have the decency to look heavy. Mara slid it onto the table between them at the library like a card in a game he was not playing. \u201cAbre,\u201d she said, and he said, \u201cNo,\u201d and she said, \u201c\u00c1brelo,\u201d imperative corrected, and he laughed and opened, and the words said yes in a different accent. She sat back and let the quiet be the first to speak. \u201cI need to think,\u201d she said, like a person who had done too much of it in too many rooms and still respected the work. He said, \u201cI\u2019m proud,\u201d and meant it and did not ask what the pride would cost him. She wrote The Subjunctive across their page like a title and under it, \u201cEspero que,\u201d and did not finish the sentence. He drew a small orange in the margin and she saw it and shook her head like a person refusing a gift and also keeping it.\n\nThey walked out into air that had learned humility and stood by the rail looking down at the plaza where a boy threw himself at a skateboard and caught himself again, the human body\u2019s argument with gravity practiced and resolved and still interesting. \u201cBe careful,\u201d she said, without the joke this time. \u201cWith me, with this, with your ideas about saving things that didn\u2019t ask.\u201d He nodded at the boy and felt the tug toward performance like a tide he could now name. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he said instead, as a simple present, not as an oath. She touched the back of his hand with the side of her finger, a contact so modest it could have been an accident if they were strangers. He did not move. \u201cBien,\u201d she said, and then looked at the sky like someone checking if weather had decided anything new.\n\nWhen the storm that was supposed to miss the city hit anyway, he stood on his porch and watched the street learn silence the way a class learns a new substitute. Snow took back roadlines and made people walk in ways that remembered childhood. A neighbor knocked on his door and asked for a shovel and he handed it over and then ten minutes later went outside to help without making a scene of it. He said to himself as they worked, \u201cSe me cay\u00f3 el miedo un poco,\u201d liking the way the accident pronoun allowed him to admit his hands had dropped something. He liked even more that he could say it without having to build a theory. Across the street, a couple he had watched fight quietly now carried groceries together, laughing in a way that made him wonder if the argument had been a way to get to this moment and not a detour.\n\nHe read to the kids a story about a woman who made a city out of snow and then watched it melt and he asked them, in Spanish, what the imperative would be if you wanted to ask snow to stay. They yelled, \u201c\u00a1Qu\u00e9date!\u201d with the reckless faith of children who have not yet learned weather\u2019s true perspective. He taught them the polite version, \u201cqu\u00e9dese,\u201d and they booed and then laughed because the sound of booing itself is funny if you let it be. Mario, newly opinionated, raised his hand and said, \u201cWe should not tell the snow what to do,\u201d and Benjamin wanted to kiss the top of the boy\u2019s head like an uncle who had misbehaved. \u201cCorrecto,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can want. We cannot boss clouds.\u201d\n\nHe texted Mara before bed with a sentence that had taken him half an hour to make simple. \u201cNo te pido nada hoy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cS\u00f3lo te digo que estoy aqu\u00ed.\u201d He flipped the phone over and turned off the light and lay with the sentence like a small animal warming itself at his throat. In the morning, an answer: \u201cGracias. Hoy, eso es suficiente.\u201d He said the word enough in both languages as he brushed his teeth and liked that it felt sharp and useful in both. The mountains appeared again for a day and then folded themselves back into fog. He packed oranges into his bag and a copy of Sor Juana and the list of imperatives he would revise for the rest of his winter. He put his hand on the knob, paused at the door, and told himself in a voice that sounded a little like Mara\u2019s grandmother and a little like his mother and not at all like Tom\u00e1s, \u201cAnda,\u201d and he did.Chapter 10\n\nJanuary kept its palm on the city\u2019s forehead like a nurse insisting rest while the patient argued. The inversion returned after every storm the way a bad habit returns after every resolution, and the mountains retreated again into the vocabulary of rumor. Benjamin wore the vice president title like a jacket he hadn\u2019t tailored yet. He had accepted it because saying no would have been a performance he didn\u2019t trust, and because there were rooms he wanted to enter without pretending to be the caterer. He found that a second nameplate on his door did not change the way his morning coffee tasted, but it did change the conversations that arrived at his desk. Men with plans came and sat without tipping their hats, and women with spreadsheets brought him edges that could cut both ways. Between emails he folded the corner of Sor Juana\u2019s page and underlined a verb and told himself not to mistake the feeling of underlining for the act of understanding.\n\nMara disappeared for forty-eight hours that first week into a visit to one of the schools that had said yes. She texted from an airport where the outlets did not keep their promises and from a train that apologized in two languages when it was late. She sent a photograph of a campus tree older than anybody in her family and a caption that said, tell me I don\u2019t owe anything to this kind of beauty, and he wrote back nothing persuasive, only, I trust you to count correctly. He watered her plants while she was gone and read the labels she had written on painter\u2019s tape for the pots\u2014ponle poquita, no seas exagerado; dale un beso de agua\u2014and he obeyed the imperatives as if disobedience would curse the whole apartment. He left an orange on her table like a coin you pay to a ferryman whether or not you\u2019re crossing.\n\nThe center ran on January like a generator, steady sound and a little heat. The kids came with red ears and boots that left puddles which David called honest footprints. Jill hung new flyers that made demands sound like invitations, and a woman from the health department set up a table with pamphlets about asthma that looked designed by a committee that hated children but loved fonts. Benjamin read about a cat who insisted on living on a roof and a boy who insisted on living on the ground, and the two of them arranged a friendship that did not ask either one to pretend the laws of physics were negotiable. Mario, hair cut again by someone with opinions, raised his hand and asked if cats could learn the conditional, and Benjamin said, only when they want, and Jill laughed because the sentence had the shape of a truth even if it was a lie.\n\nOn a Thursday afternoon when the bank\u2019s air tasted like copier toner and peppermint, a file landed on his desk with the weight of a decision disguised as a discussion. An out-of-state firm wanted to buy a strip of warehouses near the tracks and turn them into studios and cafes and three \u201cmicro-units\u201d per building that would be very macro to the rent rolls of his city. The pro forma was cheerful. The list of tenants who would have to move was a footnote with numbers where there should have been names. The credit would earn the bank a bonus laugh in the right room. He took the file to the conference room with the good projector and the bad lighting and stood there alone for a minute, the way a man stands in a chapel when he is deciding which sin he\u2019s going to commit and which he\u2019s going to postpone. He wrote on a notepad in his careful hand: covenants, notices, bilingual signage, relocation support, breathing room. He wrote on the next line: what is mine to ask.\n\nWhen he brought his list to the committee, the room arranged itself into its usual story. A senior officer with a tie the color of a warning light cleared his throat and said this is not a charity, and a younger colleague who kept fresh fruit at her desk said neither is it a machine that stamps people out. His boss gave him the look that meant speak but do not sermonize, and he spoke, and did not. He asked for conditions that cost money and saved face, for notices sent in Spanish and English with days that counted like days and not like theater, for a small fund to help tenants move without having to find trucks and cousins. The senior officer asked, practical, how much this charity would cost the bank, and Benjamin said a number that made nobody happy and therefore, he suspected, was in the neighborhood of right. The committee sighed like men at a wedding during the part where we are assured it is not a bed of roses. In the hall, his boss said that if he kept this up he would eventually be famous for the wrong reasons, and then said, not unkindly, good work, keep the number under control.\n\nHe called Jill that night because he had learned to submit his good intentions to a person who would not stroke them only in the pleasing direction. He told her the terms he\u2019d asked for and the thread he\u2019d pulled, and she listened, then said that moving a needle isn\u2019t the same as moving a house, and also that sometimes it is the only thing you get to do. She told him a family from the center had received a notice with language that said \u201cno cause\u201d in a font that didn\u2019t even pretend to be sorry. He asked the address and it was one of the numbers on the list of warehouses, and he felt his stomach perform a small, neat betrayal. \u201cI\u2019ll call,\u201d he said, and she said, \u201cDon\u2019t promise outcomes, promise presence,\u201d and he wrote that on a sticky note and put it on the wall where he couldn\u2019t avoid it when he wanted to.\n\nThe lesson that week was periphrasis, the grammar gimmicks that are actually the architecture of a life. Mara returned from her trip with a new winter on her coat and wrote on their paper: ir a + infinitive, acabar de + infinitive, volver a + infinitive, seguir + gerundio, llevar + gerundio. She said, this is how you tell people that time is not just a thing that happens to you; it\u2019s a thing you stand inside and name. He said, voy a llamar, and meant the landlord and the developer and his boss; he said, acabo de enterarme, and meant the way info arrives as if it owes you an apology; he said, vuelvo a intentar, and felt the relief of allowing himself loops. She circled seguir and wrote, you\u2019re good at this one, and he laughed because it sounded like a report card and also because it was true. \u201cLlevo tres meses yendo al centro,\u201d he tried, and she nodded like a woman blessing a baby and said, \u201cMuy bien,\u201d and then corrected his article to make the sentence less proud of itself.\n\nThey practiced the accidental se because she insisted there was not a better way to talk about responsibility in America. \u201cSe me olvid\u00f3,\u201d she said, tapping her head, explaining the protective vagueness. \u201cThe forgetting happened to me. The breaking happened to me. Nobody broke it, the world just fell.\u201d He said, \u201cSe me cay\u00f3 la paciencia,\u201d and laughed, then folded the sentence into his pocket like cash for an emergency. She told him that impersonal se might also keep him humble when he wanted to sound like a hero. \u201cSe nombr\u00f3 un comit\u00e9,\u201d she said dryly about his bank, and he responded, \u201cSe pintaron unos murales,\u201d about the warehouses he didn\u2019t want to see turned into brunch, and for a blessed minute neither of them pretended sentences were an adequate battlement against money.\n\nA small crisis came with a receipt and a date stamp. The mother with the scarf the color of persimmons arrived at the laundromat with a notice that said three days and a list of phone numbers that rang to machines. Benjamin stood with her under the relentlessness of fluorescent light and called a lawyer whose voicemail was as kind as a person can make a voicemail, and then he called a number he had written down at the bank and a man with a voice that had learned to hold all outcomes said he would look, and then he called his boss because that is what you do when your title has had letters added and doors behave differently. His boss said, careful, and then said, send me the parcel numbers, and Benjamin did, typing with more accuracy than he needed to, because accuracy is sometimes the only respect you have to offer.\n\nHe went to see the warehouses because thinking in the room has always been different than thinking in the email. The buildings were tired in noble ways. A painter had taped a sign to a door that said, don\u2019t knock between one and four unless you have an emergency or tacos, and Benjamin stood in the alley where he could see two lives at once\u2014the one where this stayed and the one where it changed\u2014and tried to name what he could live with. Tom\u00e1s appeared, because the city is smaller than anyone admits, with his collar turned up and a cigarette that he did not light out of politeness to a future exhibition. \u201cYou\u2019re meddling?\u201d he said without hostility, and Benjamin said, \u201cI\u2019m employed,\u201d and Tom\u00e1s said, \u201cIt is a thin line,\u201d and then they talked about a sculptor who was good and broke and whether those two adjectives always travel together.\n\nIt snowed on a Sunday in a way that made everyone forgive everyone else. The bilingual sacrament meeting was poorly attended because snow gives the righteous new excuses, and Benjamin sat near the back with his father and mother, who complained quietly about the draft like critics at a performance they had already decided to love. The opening hymn was one he knew in both languages and he worked the words in his mind like gum. After, he watched a woman he didn\u2019t know gather three children into their coats so efficiently he wanted to applaud. His mother said, sotto voce, in Spanish, that the bread tasted like it had been frozen and thawed, and his father said, in English, that he could live with that, and Benjamin felt that the marriage of his languages might be the only wedding he would not have to stand up to or away from this year.\n\nMestizo\u2019s Monday writing group started up again in a fit of optimism that felt like a vaccine. Caleb ran it like a circus usher, telling people where to sit and when to be brave. Benjamin came with a notebook and nothing he wanted to read and left with a line he couldn\u2019t stop saying under his breath: if you can\u2019t say I love you, say I am here and make that sentence heavy. Caleb smoked afterward and told him he should write about banking with the same shamelessness that men write about bodies, and Benjamin said, I\u2019m trying not to make easy metaphors, and Caleb said, there are no easy ones, there are only tired ones, and then he flicked ash into a snowbank that accepted everything without commentary.\n\nHe ran into Tom\u00e1s again at a coffee shop that had decided to lean into its plants. Tom\u00e1s had a magazine folded to a profile that used the word visionary three times and meant it each time less. He asked Benjamin with the grace of a man who knows how to make any question sound like small talk, what he would do if Mara left in August, and Benjamin said a sentence that had gotten him in and out of trouble all winter: seguir\u00e9. Tom\u00e1s smiled in the way men do when they recognize that a word is both an answer and a refusal, then said, she is practicing leaving, which is also a craft, and Benjamin said, she is practicing being a person who chooses, which is the same craft with better curtains.\n\nWhen Mara talked about the visit she had just made, they sat at the library away from the window because the view tempted both of them to narrate. She told him about a professor with a forehead like a fugue and a small kitchen with a window that made even a bad cup of coffee taste like a decision. She told him about walking into a room where everyone knew how to assume they belonged and the relief of discovering she could pretend this too, and the fatigue that arrives after an hour of pretending, and the small guilt of liking it. He told her about the committee and the covenants and the way he had become the man who asks for bilingual notices as if he were begging for candy, and she said, you are good at asking for small dignities and making them sound like gravity. He did not tell her he\u2019d asked his mother to teach him the napkin fold for holidays because it had begun to feel like a spell you can cast when decisions are far away.\n\nThe imperatives returned as weather. She began writing them on scrap paper and leaving them in his book as if she were trying to seed his winter. Come back. Check your verbs. Don\u2019t apologize to what you want. Eat. Don\u2019t play to the room. His favorite, which he wouldn\u2019t tell her because it would make her too powerful, was a small command that he taped to his wall above the bowl of oranges: Respira. He made a matching note for her when he left water on her windowsill with the small ferns that pretended to be tropical in a one-bedroom near a train: Duerme. When she thanked him for the plants he used the formal to make it a joke, \u201cDu\u00e9rmase,\u201d and she said, this is how love gets corny, and then said, I didn\u2019t say love, and he said, I didn\u2019t either, and they both left the sentence unpunished.\n\nA boy at the center brought a letter for his mother with a line in English that read \u201cwe regret to inform you,\u201d and Benjamin found himself translating regret to fact without the English apology that leans, with too much confidence, on the idea that naming a feeling changes the outcome. He explained slowly, in Spanish, the nonsense of thirty days, ninety days, a date by which action must be taken. The boy watched him as if he were showing him how to fix a bike chain, and Jill watched both of them as if she could make patience a force field. After, she pulled him into the little office that smelled like crayons and resolve and told him he was getting good at certain soft violences and should watch himself. He looked at her, not wounded. He knew what she meant. He said, tell me when I get it wrong. She said, I will, and I will not be gentle.\n\nHe dreamed in the pluperfect and woke up laughing. In the dream, he had loved correctly before he knew he knew how. He had had said it and then put it away like a dish. The Spanish let him treat time like dough. Hab\u00eda querido, hab\u00eda dicho, hab\u00eda sido. He lay there, mouth dry, heart not performing for anybody, and he felt the relief of tense allowing him to hold a feeling without having to risk the room. In the morning he made bad coffee and texted Mara a small piece of his dream, softened to not be a threat, and she answered with a string of verbs that read like a spell: hayas comido, hayas dormido, hayas sido cruel con tu correo electr\u00f3nico. He blessed her for making him laugh at eight in the morning in a month that had forgotten laughter without heat.\n\nThe developer with the haircut like a promise came back to the bank and sat in his office with a face that had perfected amiable and said the covenants were fine and he could make the numbers perform through other tricks, and also that if Benjamin wanted to attend the community meeting he was welcome, which is a kind of taunt that pretends to be a kind of courtesy. Benjamin said he would, because he had decided not to keep daring himself only in his head. The meeting was held in a room that had been a classroom in 1978 and never recovered from it. People came from both sides of the word change. A man with a bicycle helmet argued with a woman with three children and there was no sarcasm in either. The developer said the right sentences, including the ones about jobs and art, and Jill said the right sentences, including the ones about geography and survival, and Benjamin stood up and said the sentence he had rehearsed in a whisper\u2014this loan will go through my desk and it will have conditions and they will be enforced\u2014and what surprised him was how ordinary that sounded when it arrived in the air.\n\nOn a night when the lake was being punished by cold, he drove out alone because sometimes he wanted to see a horizon that did not require cooperation. The ice at the edge made lace again, then cracked, reminding him that not everything pretty is kind. He said sentences out loud in the conditional because winter allowed that kind of play without embarrassment. Dir\u00eda. Har\u00eda. Ser\u00eda. He tried on the future again without making it walk on a catwalk. Ir\u00e9. Estar\u00e9. Seguir\u00e9. A gull landed near enough to look at him with the suspicion all gulls are born with, and he looked back without offering an apology for not having bread. He was a man who had started to like the taste of his own restraint even when he was alone, and he made a note in his book later about not turning restraint into a costume.\n\nOne afternoon he found his mother at the kitchen table counting coins into a jar that had once held peaches. She wasn\u2019t counting because she needed the money; she was counting because sometimes counting is a prayer. He sat and counted with her and she told him, unprompted, about the first winter she and his father had spent together in an apartment with windows that felt like opinions and a stove that surrendered on Tuesdays. She used the past imperfect in English without knowing it, we were always, we used to, and he thought of correcting her grammar as a joke and then thought of how his life had become better when he had learned to let language be a place and not just a tool. She asked if Mara would come for dinner before she left, and he said, maybe, and his mother nodded like she had already prepared two new foldings for the napkins in case.\n\nMara called from the gallery to say that Tom\u00e1s had negotiated something that felt like a victory and felt like a trap and she needed to hear somebody who would not sell anything. He walked to Main in a wind that had decided to be mean and stood inside the glass, which had learned, because of winter, how to be a friend. She stood in front of a piece that looked like grief pretending to be geometry and said she had said no to one thing and yes to another and that she had gotten them in the wrong order and she knew it and she couldn\u2019t fix it and didn\u2019t want him to try. He said, I won\u2019t, because she had trained him to make his convictions simple when she was fragile. She said, tell me a nonpoetic thing about your day, and he told her about a man whose loan had been approved because he had shown up with receipts in a folder organized by month and he had smiled like a person takes a pie from an oven, and she closed her eyes and nodded as if she could smell sugar and butter.\n\nIn February the air tried being kind and failed, but its attempt warmed the sidewalks enough to make people walk like new songs. Benjamin swam and counted laps in Spanish until he forgot which language the numbers belonged to and then counted backwards just to prove that time was not exclusively linear. At the center, the kids wrote their first lines in a book Jill had made for them with cardboard and hope, and the board looked like a wall that had decided to be a window. Mario, never content with his own improvements, asked if there was a tense for when you are about to do something and might not, and Benjamin wrote \u201ctal vez\u201d on the board like a title and told a story about a lake and a woman and a sentence he didn\u2019t say. The children were bored by his melodrama and he loved them for it.\n\nHe took a morning off work to go to a hearing at the city building because he wanted to hear how public speech made its way from throats to the record. He sat through two dog licenses and a celebration of a man who had retired from public service without being caught doing anything spectacular, and then the item came. People stood and said their names and said what corner they lived on because corners make you real. He stood when it was his turn and said his name and his job and said in Spanish a single sentence to the handful who had not been addressed yet\u2014les prometo avisos que se pueden leer y tiempo que se puede contar\u2014and one of the council members who had grown up in the same county that had grown him looked at him with something like pride and something like caution. After, in the hallway, a woman with a baby said gracias in a way that pulled nothing out of him but the right nod. On the steps he found Jill and she looked like someone who had been allowed to nap for nine minutes; she squeezed his wrist without making it a ceremony and said, the trick is not to become a person who loves microphones, and he said, I am too shy, and she said, I have met men who are shy until there is a microphone.\n\nMara asked him, one evening when the lake held rain instead of ice, to drive to Millcreek and walk until the snow stopped lying. He had waited for the invitation and now that it came he answered like a man who had practiced being calm. They walked on packed paths that had learned the shape of boots. The creek was loud enough to suggest a sermon without picking a text. She told him she had been given more money than she had ever held in a single promise to move to a city that believed in itself more than it believed in humility. She told him she could see herself in that faith and hated that she wanted to, and he told her about the email he had sent that morning in Spanish and English because it had begun to feel disrespectful to demand debt in a single tongue. They spoke like people who knew that whatever would happen would not be made or unmade by the sentence they chose next, and that knowledge made them tender.\n\nAt the bend where the trail opens to a view that loves its own drama, she stopped and looked south as if the conversation lived somewhere near the mouth of the canyon. \u201cI keep making a list,\u201d she said, and he braced himself for nouns he could not compete with, and she surprised him by naming verbs. \u201cAprender. Cuidar. Traducir. Desobedecer. Sostener.\u201d He laughed, quietly, because the list was a life and because he recognized it. He added his own, Reformar. Seguir. Corregir. Perdonar. \u201cNot myself,\u201d he added quickly. \u201cNot for heroics. For mechanics.\u201d She looked at him with a soft irritation he had come to recognize as love for a person who refuses to be more romantic than the truth. \u201cYou are dangerous,\u201d she said again, the way she had months ago, and then she took his hand for six steps and then let it go because six steps can be a life if you count them correctly.\n\nThe day the covenants were signed he sat in his office and stared at the scanned document as if the pixels had morality. He had not saved a city. He had bought time for eight families and had made four men slightly annoyed, and he accepted the size of that math. He sent Jill a photograph of the page with the signatures without caption and she responded with the emoji of a cake and then wrote, I owe you something edible, and then, I would have told you to do it anyway if it had failed. He closed his notebook and placed his pen on it as if he were done writing for the day and then wrote one more sentence because nobody gets to be done at three: seguir\u00e9.\n\nNear the end of the month, Mara came over with a bag of mandarins and a face like a person deciding what kind of goodbye she wanted to practice. She held one mandarin up to the light as if testing it for clarity and then set it on the table and said, I said yes, and I need you to practice hearing it without making a face that tries to be noble and ends up scolding me. He breathed once, twice, and put his hands flat on the table as if he were making a church out of a pew. He said, I am proud, and then, I will miss you, and then, I will buy more oranges than I need, because even in this moment he believed in the saving power of small jokes. She sat, and because she had never been cruel to him on purpose and had no intention of starting, she added, I will still be here for months, and the word months sounded both generous and meager. They made a list of places to go without making the list a vow, and he promised to teach her the fold his mother had taught him last, the mountain that sits up on the plate like a small, defiant geography.\n\nThat night he stood at his sink with his hands in dishwater that had given up being hot and said the verb forms out loud like prayers without saints. Voy a seguir. Voy a leer. Voy a abrir la boca cuando sirva. He thought of the first time he had said conejo wrong and Mario had corrected him kindly, of the first time he had read in public and not regretted it at two in the morning, of the first time he had said to his mother hace fr\u00edo and watched her adopt the phrase like a stray. He thought of the lake teaching him that a horizon is a kind of promise that nobody can enforce. He put an orange peel on the edge of the sink and pressed it with his thumb until the oil lifted and stung his skin. He laughed because it hurt and felt awake, and he went to sleep like a person who had negotiated with his own future and decided to meet it one tense at a time.\n\nWhen March arrived with the saddest rain he had ever loved, he and Mara went to the laundromat posada\u2019s quieter cousin, a book distribution where the lights hummed and the dryers spun and nobody sang. He handed picture books to children who accepted them with the gravity of bankers and watched mothers choose between two covers like people choosing futures. The woman with the persimmon scarf, her mailbox now a photograph attached to a file with three signatures, handed him a tub of soup and told him her rent had stopped rising for one month, which is not a miracle but looks like one if you are tired enough. Jill stood on a chair to adjust the string of lights and said, do not climb on things you are not prepared to fall from, and David said, I will catch you, and she said, do not promise that in a room with this much tile.\n\nOn the way home, he and Mara walked under rain that did not have the teeth of snow but had its persistence. She told him that she had begun telling people she would leave and watched their faces and learned something improper and useful about her standing. He told her that a man at the bank had congratulated him on his community work in a tone that meant it was a nice hobby as long as it did not interrupt profit, and she told him not to waste rage on men who practiced compliments as discipline. They stood under a tree that had not yet decided whether to believe in spring and he said, the future isn\u2019t arrogant today, and she said, good, then let\u2019s practice it, and they did, with verbs in both languages like handholds on a wall neither of them owned. He did not kiss her and she did not step back. They made a shape out of weather and grammar and the kind of love that had learned from both to be exact without pretending to be correct.\n\nAt home, Sor Juana waited at the table open to lines he had already marked and would mark again as if repetition were a way to become faithful to yourself. He read the part where desire makes an argument and reason answers with a joke, and he thought of all the mouths that had said te quiero and not meant it, and of his own that had practiced sentences the way a man practices an instrument when the audience is still asleep. He wrote a letter he would not send, as was his habit, and in it he did not say I love you. He said instead, I will be here when you want to practice the conditional, and, I will bring napkins to any place that slices oranges, and, I will remember to breathe when you tell me to and when you don\u2019t. He folded the letter into the book as if it were only another scrap of paper, and he slept hard enough to believe in morning.",

Salt in the air like coins licked and passed around. Benjamin lay there listening, as if the machine had come specifically for him, to rub him down to something shining. The blinds rattled. The light was the soft grey of an inversion and the Wasatch were a shape more remembered than seen from his window. He put the heel of his hand to his eye and pressed. Another day.\n\nOn the walk to the bank he caught a whiff of the Great Salt Lake\u2014metallic, a ghost of brine shrimp\u2014and watched gulls squabble on the lip of a trash can near City Creek, their quarrels a quick slapstick he always pretended held meaning. Temple Square\u2019s granite looked clean as paper behind glass. Once, every other sidewalk conversation he overheard used the soft words he grew up on, the ones that tucked him in at night, a family of nouns and verbs all about building, about eternity, about neatness. Now it was start-ups, skiing, outrage over zoning laws, meat-heavy brunches. He adjusted his tie and tried to match his pace to a man in a Lululemon jacket, then let him go.\n\nHe was thirty-five and wore the confidence of a banker like an afterthought, which in some ways it was. He worked in the corporate lending division on the seventh floor of a building that promised respectability and delivered views of the Oquirrhs. Numbers behaved for him; they lined up and became obedient. He liked the balance of a loan package that showed its own logic, that gave itself away. But at his desk, his cursor sometimes blinked like a heartbeat too fast, like a child told to sit still. He would look up and not see anything, only his reflection in the glass, his own face making a faint motion\u2014chewing?\u2014while the city moved on without him.\n\nAt noon he ate a turkey sandwich alone in the little park near Gallivan, listening to a busker with chapped fingers pick an angry melody and still call every passerby \u201csir\u201d or \u201cma\u2019am.\u201d He bit into the bread, dry that day, and wondered why he had never learned Spanish properly when half his clients\u2019 workers were talking it over the loading docks, when the best tacos in town were easier to reach than a belief. He had taken two semesters in college, if you could call the first semester \u201cattendance\u201d and the second \u201cflirtation with a girl named Kimberly who kissed him once in the back of a linguistics lecture and then married a dentist.\u201d He used to think his failure to become bilingual was a charming flaw, an imperfection that marked his normality and kept him from something sharper, but lately he was tired of being charmed by his own deficiencies. He wanted to enter a warehouse and greet a man rolling a pallet jack with something other than the short, humiliating nod of an uninvited guest.\n\nHe tore a small square from the city\u2019s weekly paper to have something to fold and unfold, a nervous tick too humble even to admit itself. On the back of an advertisement for an improv theatre workshop was a four-by-four box with a simple line of type: Spanish Tutoring and Conversation. Patient, culturally minded, sliding scale. Mara. A number. He folded the paper into a turret and put it in his pocket and that night, after left-overs and a late run to the post box on 2nd Ave, he dialed the number and then hung up twice before he let it ring.\n\nHer voice came quick and light, as if she had been moving around the room when she answered. It had a shape like smiling does. \u201cHola,\u201d she said, then switched, \u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d he said too loudly. He cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m calling about the tutoring.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d she said, the word warm. He imagined her leaning over a small desk, a notebook open, sunlight on her wrist. \u201cOkay. Great. What do you\u2014how much do you already know?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery little. Less than\u2026 less than you might hope,\u201d he said, and then tried not to add a self-deprecating laugh to fill what felt like a gap. He failed; he laughed anyway, a short bark that sounded like his father catching a fish.\n\n\u201cWe start where we are,\u201d she said, without any performance in it, like a simple rule. \u201cWhere are you? Do you know present tense? Do you know how to say your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cMe llamo Benjamin,\u201d he said, amazed his tongue remembered anything at all. The presence of his name in another language felt like a secret him he had misplaced somewhere.\n\n\u201cMucho gusto, Benjamin. Soy Mara. Do you want conversation, grammar, reading? Do you have reasons?\u201d Her voice barely turned reasons into a question; it sounded more like an invitation to talk.\n\n\u201cI\u2014work. Work reasons. And because I don\u2019t want to be an idiot for the rest of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd because\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to say the kinds of things I want to say.\u201d\n\nShe paused, and he realized he\u2019d provided too much. \u201cWe\u2019ll find them,\u201d she said, not unkind. \u201cWhere do you want to meet?\u201d\n\n\u201cWherever you teach. A coffee shop? Is that okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe library is good,\u201d she said. \u201cThe big one on 210 East. The caf\u00e9 there is quiet and they don\u2019t mind us taking up space. Or\u2014I have a small place, but I think for the first time, the library. Tomorrow at six? Or too fast?\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow at six,\u201d he said, and it was only after he hung up that he felt the unsteady rush in his chest, a feeling like stepping onto a moving walkway that was faster than it first looked. He wrote her name on the torn piece of paper and set it on the counter, as if it were something that might need to be admired by a passerby.\n\nThe City Library\u2019s glass tilted like a sail and made its own weather inside. He arrived ten minutes early and pretended to look for a book but stood in front of the New Fiction display reading the back of a paperback about a whale and trying to understand whether the author was being ironic in his gratitude. At the caf\u00e9 he took a corner table and looked into the square. A group of teenagers took photographs of each other in front of the public art. A woman in a bright coat spoke sharply to a man who had stopped beside her with a grin already trying itself on. Benjamin\u2019s hands went cold the way they did before any meeting that mattered.\n\nShe came in without looking around for him, which made him study her all the harder before she found him. She was shorter than his mind had made her, hair pulled into a hasty twist that left wisps at her temples. A blue sweater the color of an inland lake. Jeans with a paint stain on the back of the left thigh that would have been contrived on an expensive pair. When her eyes fell on him she smiled in a way that made him think she would have smiled just as genuinely at anyone else. It might have been a trick; it wasn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cBenjamin?\u201d she said with a question in it, even though they both knew the answer. He stood too fast and knocked his knee against the table so his coffee trembled awake.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cSorry, I\u2014please\u2014hi.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d she said. \u201cMara.\u201d She put her bag on a chair and sat. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do any of the thing where you tell me you\u2019re bad at this. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re good at many things and bad at some others and I am too. Today we can learn how to say \u2018I am buying fruit\u2019 or something thrilling like that.\u201d\n\nHe laughed before he could help it. \u201cThat sounds thrilling,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean it.\u201d\n\nShe took out a small notebook and a pen. No laptop, no stack of worksheets with a logo. \u201cWe start with you. Who are you? She touched her pen to the page. \u201cWho do you talk to? What do you want to say by next week, not next year?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a banker,\u201d he said. \u201cI came up with a list of things to tell you about myself and they\u2019re all boring. I\u2019m from here. I swim at Steiner when I\u2019m pretending I don\u2019t hate exercise. I make abysmal scrambled eggs. I used to go to church before it stopped feeling like church.\u201d\n\nShe nodded, wrote banker in a slow, careful way, even though it was a simple word and she knew it. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cBanker. Want to say to your clients, to workers, to\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cWorkers,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd friends. Future friends.\u201d He surprised himself again with that last part and felt, for a second, sixteen.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, and pointed at him with her pen as if to bless this plan. \u201cSpanish is full of ways to avoid saying anything directly, which is useful, and it\u2019s full of ways to be very direct, which is also useful. We\u2019ll do both. Ready?\u201d Without waiting, she began, gentle and relentless, the way a stream works on stone. He repeated after her, stumbling, and then again without stumbling; she corrected him without letting him drown in his own apology. At one point he said \u201cembarazado\u201d when he meant \u201cembarrassed\u201d and she lifted a hand, smiled, and said, careful. \u201cEmbarrassed is \u2018avergonzado.\u2019 Embrazado is something else. Unless there\u2019s something you want to tell me.\u201d\n\nHis cheeks went hot and he made the laugh he had already started to hate, and she let him off the hook by telling him how in Spanish you didn\u2019t say \u201cI am cold\u201d but \u201cI have cold,\u201d and how in her grandmother\u2019s house the phrase was half prayer, tengo fr\u00edo, mija, and someone would put a towel in the dryer and wrap you while it was still warm. He imagined her grandmother\u2019s hands and felt for a moment like all of this was not language but a way into something that had been happening all around him, always, without him being invited to look.\n\n\u201cFor homework,\u201d she said at the end of an hour that had passed faster than an hour had any right to, \u201cI want you to listen. No apps yet. Just listen. Go to Rancho Market and buy oranges in the afternoon and stand in line and listen to what the person in front of you calls the cashier. Go to Red Iguana if you want to be surrounded by a thousand people who can\u2019t get enough of mole and just listen to how the servers take patience and make it into a tool. And we\u2019ll read something too, because reading is like lifting small weights over and over until a door opens without squeaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do we read?\u201d he said. He wanted to impress her, but he did not know any writers whose names wouldn\u2019t embarrass both of them.\n\n\u201cI brought you this,\u201d she said, taking a slim book from her bag. The cover was blue and a little worn at the edges. \u201cSor Juana. We can read her slower than anyone has ever read her and it will still be too fast. This one and some Neruda. And this.\u201d She slid him a photocopy of a poem by a poet whose name he could not pronounce. \u201cFor when you have energy. But don\u2019t force it. The mouth learns first.\u201d\n\nHe held the book like it had warmth in it. \u201cHow much do I pay you?\u201d he said, suddenly remembering he had not asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sliding,\u201d she said, looking at him as if to say she knew, approximately, which end of the slide he would be on. \u201cWhat can you pay?\u201d\n\n\u201cEighty,\u201d he said, picking a number on the safe side of generous.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d she said, and he saw the momentary almost, the tiny calculation, as if she was measuring grocery lists against hours. \u201cSixty is also fine. This is not\u2014\u201d She paused, hunting for a word she wanted. \u201cWe\u2019re not negotiating across a table.\u201d\n\n\u201cEighty,\u201d he said, wanting not to be cheap and not to be theatrical about not being cheap. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. She wrote down her Venmo. Her writing had a clarity, a gate that was open and careful. \u201cWe\u2019ll do Tuesdays, if that works. At six. And text me if anything changes.\u201d\n\nHe walked out into the early evening with the book beneath his arm like a report that had just cleared compliance, both the same and not even a little. The sky had decided not to produce a sunset and so there was only the one color, a soft lid over everything. He went home and cooked asparagus poorly and then read the first lines of the Sor Juana aloud to his sink, and then again until the vowels stopped acting like the enemy, until he could taste something in them.\n\nHis parents\u2019 house was in Bountiful; it took him exactly nineteen minutes to \u201cdrop by\u201d when dropping by sounded to him like an obligation with frosting. He called his mother that Sunday and she talked about the stake potluck, who had moved (the Brinkleys) and who had returned (nobody, she said in that tone that meant everybody), and then about the temple wedding she had gone to a week before. He let the words drift\u2014so many capitals\u2014until she asked casually, like a fisherman would of a lake he had known since boyhood, \u201cAre you seeing anyone, Benji?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m learning Spanish,\u201d he said, which was also an answer, in a way.\n\n\u201cThat sounds good,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the mission you should have gone on,\u201d and then they both fell silent, not because it was awkward exactly but because there is a kind of quiet that arrives when both parties are looking at slightly different calendars at the same time.\n\nOn Tuesday he brought Mara a coffee that he hoped she liked. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask if you drank coffee,\u201d he said, too late to change it to tea.\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mother already lit a candle for me about it. No wait, that was for driving in the snow. But coffee is in there somewhere.\u201d Her smile was quick. \u201cGracias.\u201d She drank and then wrinkled her nose like a cat. \u201cIt\u2019s a little burnt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey told me it was good,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey always tell you that,\u201d she said.\n\nThey sat at the library again, and then the next week and the next. He met Mara in his sentences first, in the way she would lean toward him without making a performance of it when his mouth was working around a word like \u201cpuente,\u201d and then lean back when he got it right, as if she were unwilling to make triumph into anything other than a shared fact. He noticed her soft freckles, the way she held a pen like a baton, ready to conduct. To himself, he admitted he liked the way she made nouns look like verbs, young as she was and already teaching him how to build a room around a verb. He did not know how old she was until she mentioned her sister\u2019s seventeen-year-old car that only went uphill if coaxed, and he asked, and she said she was twenty-seven, and he felt both too old and exactly right.\n\n\u201cDo you always do this?\u201d he asked her one day, when they were packaging \u201cgustar\u201d into something that would not make him weep. \u201cTutor adults who think they\u2019re already seaworthy?\u201d\n\n\u201cI tutor anyone who wants to learn,\u201d she said. Then she set the pen down and let it spin in a small orbit where their wrists had been nearly touching. \u201cMostly I work with kids. The after-school program in Rose Park. But adults are refreshing. You come with your own mistakes. Kids come with other people\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long have you been doing it?\u201d\n\n\u201cSince high school, really. I used to help my dad with his English assignments, even though I didn\u2019t know English then either. Which is to say,\u201d she smiled, \u201cwe both got a little fluent in pretending.\u201d She turned a page. He noticed the hole on her sweater cuff where a thumb should go but just a thread went. \u201cMy father\u2019s a welder. My mother stocks shelves at night at Smith\u2019s. My little brother does Fortnite and algebra at the same time. I\u2019m at the U for literature but slowly, because money is a language too and I have an accent.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to say something worthy. \u201cYou\u2019re good at this,\u201d he said instead, and she shrugged the way only someone who knows the truth of such a sentence shrugs.\n\nAt work, he found that words swam. He would be in a meeting with a man from Ogden who ran a business buying and selling metal roofs and he would watch, out of the corner of his eye, the shape of the man\u2019s mouth on certain vowels, and think about how \u201ctecho\u201d sounded like a toy, and how \u201cinterest\u201d and \u201cinter\u00e9s\u201d were siblings with a long-standing grudge. He\u2019d go to Steiner and swim laps and hear \u201cuno, dos, tres\u201d in the back of his head, like a metronome he had not given permission to but was grateful for anyway. At night he would practice in his kitchen, \u201cYo quiero\u2014,\u201d and the refrigerator would hum in an encouraging key.\n\nHe stopped by Rancho Market on his way home from the bank, as he had been instructed. The aisles felt like a party he had walked into late, the bread loud with sesame, the butcher counter a display of frankness. He stood in the line for oranges and listened to a woman in scrubs call the cashier \u201cmi amor,\u201d and the young man with forearms like straight roads call her \u201cjefa,\u201d and the cashier reply, \u201cqu\u00e9 m\u00e1s, pues,\u201d and he did not understand every word but knew it was not about more, not really, but about making space. He bought twelve oranges. In the parking lot he put one on his tongue right away and nearly laughed, the juice so unexpectedly urgent.\n\nOn the fourth Tuesday, he told her a story about a client who had refused to sign something because of a superstition about the number written on the page. He told it poorly, fragmented by tense and his own seriousness. Halfway through she leaned forward and touched his arm, a light, brief thing, and said, \u201cYou can also say it like this,\u201d and she recast his story in that other rhythm, rounding and bright, and he felt seen in a way that made him a little ashamed of how long he had gone without that feeling. He looked at her mouth while she spoke, because he was supposed to, and then allowed himself to look at the curve of her cheek. He looked away too quickly and then too slow and the moment went back to being a lesson.\n\nHe had dated, in the past, with varied outcomes and no disasters that counted to anyone but the participants. He had been engaged, once, to a woman named Clare who had loved his steadiness until she did not. They had parted in a way they both agreed was adult, which is not the same as kind. On Sundays he sometimes missed the liturgy he had grown up in, the rooms where he knew exactly where to put his hands, exactly when to kneel and when to rise. Sometimes he would sit at a caf\u00e9 and consider walking to a chapel where nobody expected him anymore and then stand up and pay his bill and go home instead.\n\nWhen March turned the city\u2019s parks to false spring and then back again to dirty snow, Mara changed their meeting place. \u201cDo you mind if we move it to Mestizo next week,\u201d she texted him. \u201cThere\u2019s an exhibit there my friend curated and I promise the coffee is not burnt.\u201d\n\nHe got there a little early and pretended again to read the community board. An advertisement for an open mic night made him wince on behalf of fragile humankind. He ordered coffee and a pastry that was more generous than it needed to be. Small paintings hung on the walls, some good enough to make him want to be alone with them, some like you could see the painter\u2019s hunger still wet on the canvas. On a table by the door was a stack of zines, their stapled spines determined and crooked.\n\nMara came with a friend, which startled him. The woman was tall, with a streak of white in her hair that made her look like something had chosen her. \u201cThis is Jill,\u201d Mara said. \u201cShe\u2019s a social worker. Jill, this is Benjamin, he is learning how to say really important things like \u2018what time is the loan due\u2019 and \u2018where are the oranges.\u2019\u201d\n\nJill shook his hand in a way that told him she was not entirely joking. \u201cNice to meet you,\u201d she said. \u201cMara was going to tell you about the fundraiser next month but she wanted to see if you\u2019d run away at the mention of the word fundraiser.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like fundraisers,\u201d Benjamin said, lying in a very strangely sincere way.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m curating the art,\u201d Jill said, gesturing at the walls. \u201cThis is sort of practice, except with less wine. We\u2019re raising money for a little program in Rose Park that is definitely not a non-profit because nobody has time for paperwork, but it teaches kids to write about themselves instead of letting other people do it for them. You\u2019re welcome to come, buy utterly overpriced prints and food you could make at home for half the cost, and meet people who will talk to you very directly about housing but not tell you where they live.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come,\u201d he said, and saw the way Mara\u2019s eyes flickered\u2014approval, amusement, a small surprise that was not quite surprise.\n\nThey did their lesson anyway. When Jill had to go she kissed Mara\u2019s cheek and squeezed Benjamin\u2019s shoulder as if they were already all friends. He watched her go and wondered about Mara\u2019s world, the one in which people held onto one another without hesitation and did their work in rooms with walls that remembered every conversation and kept some of them safe.\n\nAfter they finished conjugating and then breaking the conjugation into smaller pieces so he could fit it into his mouth, she said, \u201cWhat do you do when you\u2019re not banking and repeating after me? Do you still swim?\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cI also hike in the summer, because it is required by city ordinance, and ski in the winter, but badly. I read. I pretend to cook. I try not to think about how we knocked Mike Trout\u2019s forty-million-dollar season into our conversations like it was a normal amount of money to say out loud.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you like your job?\u201d she said.\n\nHe considered. \u201cI like being useful,\u201d he said. \u201cI like when I can say yes. Sometimes I say no and I think I am a grown-up but sometimes I say no and I think I am just a small guard at a gate that shouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d\n\nShe looked at him in the way she sometimes did, like he was not a worksheet but a person. \u201cYou could write,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who think like that always write.\u201d\n\nHe laughed. \u201cWhat, like poems?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody gets one bad poem and three good ones if they live long enough.\u201d She tapped the book he carried now without missing a day. \u201cSor Juana would tell you what to do if you asked her. She would make a face and then she would tell you.\u201d\n\nHe went to the fundraiser. He told himself it would be support, and also homework. It was in a borrowed space in a warehouse by the tracks, a place that smelled like wood and possibility. People were there in every decade of age and wearing clothes that had clearly been purchased with different intentions. A woman sold empanadas that felt like a kindness when held. On one wall hung photographs of a city he recognized beyond its brochure version: a toddler on a stoop licking something that had melted faster than anyone could eat it, a man fixing a bicycle with a concentration that was obviously love.\n\nMara was working a table by the door, taking cash and smiling without making it cheap. When she saw him she raised her eyebrows, pleased and surprised, and he felt a small, bright victory he had no right to. She introduced him to more people\u2014Jill again, and a man named David who ran an after-school program and had the tiredness of someone who had chosen his work every day, and a woman named Tamsin who owned a gallery and dressed like the concept of winter. It was not his world. It did not feel that way and it did. He found himself talking in Spanish to a teenager about a zine he had made and understood every other sentence and made the rest up.\n\nAfter an hour, he realized he had never before been at a fundraiser where nobody asked him for a pledge. Here they asked him if he could come on Tuesday afternoons to read aloud to kids whose parents would not be home yet. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anything else from you,\u201d Jill said, a glitter of warning in it. \u201cDon\u2019t bring us your banking ideas. Bring your voice.\u201d\n\nHe said he would try, knowing that trying was a word that often meant almost. He made a donation anyway. It was probably too much. It was perhaps not enough.\n\nOn their way out into the night, Mara folded a paper program into a plane and then unfolded it again, the crease made and unmade. \u201cGracias,\u201d she said. \u201cFor coming.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to,\u201d he said. He did not add for you, though the words pushed like a crowd behind a door.\n\nShe tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cYou should be careful,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWith Spanish?\u201d he said, and she laughed, covering her mouth, as if that would keep the church ladies from gossiping.\n\n\u201cWith me,\u201d she said, softly and not softly. \u201cI know it\u2019s a thing to warn people about. I don\u2019t mean it dramatically. It\u2019s just\u2014I have, I guess, feet in different rooms. And I\u2019ve been bad at not getting pulled.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to ask what rooms. He also knew that question was more than a question. He said, \u201cMe too,\u201d because he had meant it about church and work and the way sometimes the trails in Millcreek could make him believe one thing very clearly in the morning and a different thing in the afternoon. He looked at her and realized he had already reached toward her in a way that was not reversible.\n\nHe slept badly that night. The city made its own small strains and groans. He dreamed he was sitting at a long table with his family and they were speaking Spanish and he was not. He woke up laughing, a small, desperate little sound, and then lay there not moving, the ceiling a new Bible he did not know by heart.\n\nOn Monday morning he went to work and said yes to two things and no to one and looked out the window at the line of winter and spring arguing without either of them having to say a word. He looked down at a man sleeping on a heating grate with his whole body trying to tuck itself back into itself. He thought of what a banker was, and what it was not.\n\nOn Tuesday he went to the library and found Mara at the table with someone else\u2019s head bowed next to her. For a second he thought he had gotten the time wrong. Then she looked up and smiled with that same shape and waved him over, but her eyes were different.\n\n\u201cThis is Caleb,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s applying for something hideous and needs to know whether to say whom. Benjamin, can you wait five minutes?\u201d\n\nHe sat. He waited. He watched the two of them in their quick shorthand, the way she underlined and his mouth twisted at his own sentence. This is not jealousy, he told himself, absolutely, this is a normal human who has no rights to this person acknowledging that she exists in a world that does not yet include the particular role he wishes to audition for. He felt ridiculous and then he felt like he would remember this moment later and it would mean something else entirely.\n\nAfter Caleb stood and shook his hand and left, Mara turned to him and what changed in her eyes changed back. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI know we said six. He texted and needed something. He\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s a lot. He makes friends with judges.\u201d\n\n\u201cJudges,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOf poetry,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich is more dangerous than the first kind.\u201d\n\nThey worked. He could feel, under, the small drift of her attention to something that was not him. It made him precise, for a little while; it made him sloppy, later. When he left he passed Caleb on the sidewalk, smoking, and the man had a manner\u2014loose, practiced\u2014that made Benjamin want to go home and iron his shirts for the second time.\n\nIt was a nothing, he told himself. It was everything, he also accidentally told himself.\n\nThey kept meeting. He got better, which astonished him, like the way dogs in a park have to be surprised every day that the door opens and there is grass waiting. He sketched, in his mind, what it would be to invite Mara for coffee after the lesson that already included coffee, to ask her for a walk when the warm days came back for real, to offer to drive her to Park City one afternoon in June because she had mentioned vaguely she liked to go there once a year to see the kind of houses that were not on her street. He rehearsed in his car. He practiced how not to sound like a man performing sincerity. He failed in the rehearsals and said to himself that failure in practice was proof of wisdom.\n\nOne afternoon he found himself lingering too long on a photograph in her phone. It was without context\u2014a shot of her and two women in dresses standing on the balcony of a building that was clearly not in his part of town, the view sweeping toward white streets and lights. \u201cPark City,\u201d she said when she saw his eyes catch. \u201cA party. Jill\u2019s friend Tamsin. She has a gallery and a\u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter. It was one of those nights where the lights were very impressed with themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look happy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI was,\u201d she said, and then tilted her head, and said, \u201cEverybody was being very kind. And very not kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s that work?\u201d he said, knowing exactly how, and wanting to hear her say it anyway. The word class did not appear; it was unnecessary.\n\nShe shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s like being fed. You get full. But later you realize you didn\u2019t get anything to drink.\u201d\n\nHe did not ask whether Caleb had been there. The question sat down anyway between them.\n\nWhen he asked her for coffee she said yes and then the next morning texted no. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t.\u201d When he asked, neutral as he could make it, \u201cShouldn\u2019t?\u201d she wrote back, \u201cI\u2019m trying to keep work as work. It\u2019s not you. It\u2019s my promises to myself. And to my\u2014 family.\u201d\n\nHe said he understood. He said it in the language he was learning and the one he had been born into. He practiced moving past it. He wasn\u2019t good at it. He didn\u2019t drown.\n\nWhen spring came in earnest, the mountains were right there again, abrupt with their own logic. He went up Millcreek Canyon one afternoon and hiked until the snow stopped being a trick and started being snow. He stood and listened to water fighting to get out from under, the sound both ancient and brand-new. He thought about Mara and told himself, sternly, go slow. He slipped on a patch of ice and went down hard and laughed until his elbow hurt less.\n\nIn mid-May, after a lesson in which he successfully told a small story about a loan officer and a cow and the way a misunderstanding had turned into something beautiful, she told him she would be changing their schedule. \u201cI got a job,\u201d she said, her smile not quite reaching her eyes. \u201cAt the gallery. The one I told you about. Just for the summer. The money is stupid and so I said yes. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d She paused. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 I mean I am happy. I am not the right kind of happy for you to think I should be.\u201d\n\nHe did not know how to contain his face. He tamped it down. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s great. Congratulations.\u201d He meant it. He did not.\n\n\u201cWe can keep Tuesdays for now,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I might move around some nights. There will be events. I\u2019ll invite you if you want. They will be very amusing. You will have to pretend microgreens are more important than they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t try too hard,\u201d she said.\n\nHe went home and looked at the Sor Juana and then put her back down. He went for a walk. He passed, on the corner, a couple arguing in a way that was too quiet to be a fight and too loud to be anything else. He kept walking.\n\nOn a Thursday he walked across Main at dusk and saw her through the glass of a restaurant, seated at a table with Tamsin and three men with cuffs he would not have dared crease. Her dress was a color he did not have a word for without Google. She laughed and put her hand on Tamsin\u2019s wrist, and then leaned back and looked for a second out the window and her gaze slid past him and then she saw him and did an almost imperceptible double-take, pulled the corner of her mouth into a small private thing, then resumed. He wanted to go inside and kiss her. He wanted to go home. He did neither. He stood and watched until the light changed and then he crossed and did not look again.\n\nOn Saturday he went to the farmer\u2019s market at Pioneer Park and bought radishes and a loaf of bread and watched children with their faces painted eat strawberries with an urgency that made him miss being five. He bumped into Jill, whose hair was pulled back and who had a tote bag full of something leafy. \u201cSo you\u2019re an adult who keeps promises to come to things,\u201d she said. \u201cYou all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, then added, \u201cMara got the job.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Jill said. \u201cShe\u2019ll be great and she\u2019ll hate it and then she\u2019ll love it and then she\u2019ll hate it correctly. You?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will be supportive at a reasonable distance,\u201d he said.\n\nJill looked at him. \u201cYou are very sweet,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich is not always a compliment, but I mean it. Don\u2019t get eaten. By us. Or by them.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to ask, who is us; who is them. He didn\u2019t, because he knew; because it was clear that both words moved depending on where your feet were. He bought more radishes than any human should and went home and listened to Sor Juana tell him what a tongue can do in a mouth that wants.\n\nHe texted Mara that night. \u201cCongratulations again. I keep thinking about what you said about being fed. If you need a drink of water, I have a sink.\u201d\n\nShe wrote back, after an hour, \u201cThank you. That is probably the best and most ridiculous message anyone\u2019s sent me this week. I do need water. I don\u2019t know from where yet. But I\u2019ll let you know if your sink is the one.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways here,\u201d he wrote. Then, without waiting for the little ellipses to appear, he put his phone face-down on the table and sat on his couch and turned off the light and let the room wrap him without promises.\n\nAt their next lesson, she arrived late, hair pinned up in a way that did not attempt to appear effortless. He pretended not to notice. He was trying to be the kind of person who could say \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d and mean it. She smelled like a place he had not been.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing the past tense today,\u201d she said, dropping a stack of cards on the table. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about everything you did and didn\u2019t do. It\u2019s a trap, because then you tell me your life story and I correct your grammar instead of your choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did it on purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cNot actually. Probably not.\u201d\n\nShe laughed and then rubbed her eyes. He saw then how tired settled into a face in delicate ways. \u201cI stayed at an opening until midnight,\u201d she said. \u201cA man told me I had changed his life with my placement of his work beside a window. He did not realize I had simply run out of wall.\u201d\n\nHe had nothing to say that would not make both of them someone else. They did the past tense the way she had promised\u2014badly at first, laughing, then better, then to the point where he could say \u201cI wanted\u201d and mean \u201cI should have\u201d without asking for mercy from the verb. Halfway through, a man in a navy suit approached their table and put his hand on the back of Mara\u2019s chair as if it had already been waiting for his hand. \u201cMara,\u201d he said.\n\nShe looked up. \u201cHi,\u201d she said. \u201cTom\u00e1s, this is Benjamin. He\u2019s my student. Benjamin, this is Tom\u00e1s. He\u2014works with Tamsin.\u201d She did not make the sentence mean more than that. Tom\u00e1s glanced at Benjamin with the quick, practiced appraisal of a person who had entered a room with a plan and did not like anything that had not come in the plan. He was handsome in the way an elevator is handsome. He made a polite noise. \u201cWe\u2019re running late,\u201d he said to Mara, in a tone both apologetic and not apologetic at all.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m working,\u201d she said, and looked at Benjamin in a way that made him part of a triangle. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in thirty minutes.\u201d\n\nTom\u00e1s made a small show of checking the time and then a larger show of smiling. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said, with an accent that Benjamin\u2019s ears, now attuned to such things, placed as somewhere south of where he had expected, and north of where Mara had been born. He left a hand on the chair a second too long. Then it was gone. He left.\n\nBenjamin had never wanted to win anything in that way before. It embarrassed him. It exhilarated him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mara said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be,\u201d he said, and knew he wanted her to be. He began to laugh and then made himself stop. \u201cWe can stop early if you need to.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, too quickly. \u201cNo. I like this. I don\u2019t want to only\u2014\u201d She looked for a word and found it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to only perform.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome performances are necessary,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you do it all day and then you do it all night then you wake up and you look in the mirror and think: who is she, and why is she in my apartment.\u201d\n\nHe hardly breathed. \u201cWho is she?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEveryone else\u2019s idea,\u201d she said, crisp and almost cheerful, in the way a person sometimes tells you a difficult thing with a practiced ease so you won\u2019t flinch and so she won\u2019t either.\n\nThey conjugated until the hour was over and then he walked with her to the entrance and watched her meet Tom\u00e1s half a block away, watched the way she put her hand on her own shoulder, a small, self-comforting thing, and then drop it in case someone would call it weakness. He stood there until he felt foolish and then he walked home the long way and told himself that this story would take a long time to be told right. He told himself not to try to aim the end of it. He told himself he could wait, which was both true and false and a kind of the only thing he could do.\n\nHe put the book on his table, open to a place where Sor Juana described desire like a horse that won\u2019t wear a bit. He said the words out loud even though he did not need to and thought, briefly, of women who put words in their mouths and made men listen whether they wanted to or not.\n\nThe city turned toward summer. The light stayed late like a guest with something left to say. He saw Mara twice a week, then once, then not at all for one stretch of nine days that felt like an experiment he had not consented to. When she returned she was brighter, somehow, and also far away, like a street seen at night through rain. He wanted to tell her he could stand rain. He wanted to tell her nothing. He told her the story in Spanish of how he had once fallen in love with a woman who wanted the sea more than she wanted him, and how he had tried to become tide. He told it badly, but she understood. He could see it in her eyes. He could see also that understanding and choosing were cousins who did not always speak.\n\nIn the middle of June he saw her at the top of the City Creek stairs with a cluster of people who were making plans for an after party he had not been invited to, watched her listen and watch them watch themselves. She turned, caught his gaze, mouthed something he later translated to \u201csoon,\u201d and he nodded, and they stood thirty feet apart and felt both exactly where they were and also far. He went home and washed his dishes as if the plates could teach him how to wait without bitterness.\n\nHe had not known, when he called the number on a newspaper like a boy answering a carnival ad, that he was enrolling in a tenderness with a lesson plan. He did not know how many quizzes were coming. But by the end of June, when he could tell the story of his day in the past tense without stopping to apologize to the verbs, he knew this: that he had not been wrong to put his feet in a different room and try to speak in a voice that was not his own. That it would take him longer than he had thought to be understood. That he had already begun to translate not just himself but the way he wanted to be in the world\u2014slower, aspirin-like, dissolving into something and making it less painful.\n\nHe also knew that the air on evenings when he passed the gallery was different around the door, as if air itself got ready to perform. He knew that he would keep going in anyway, with his tie slightly askew, with the book in his bag, with oranges on his counter at home turning toward sweetness. He knew the mountain didn't care about any of this and also cared about all of it, because it took everything and made it weather and let it fall again somewhere else. He knew that July would be a heat that softened everything\u2019s edges and then made them sharp again, and that he would stand in it and learn the imperfect, and that the future tense would require more faith than he had expected. He knew, most of all, that he would not stop moving his mouth, learning how to say what he wanted and then wanting to say it better.\n\nOne hot night at the end of the month, he found himself on his porch, the street humming with a low summer sound, and he imagined a life in which he could say to Mara, simple as oranges, I love you. He practiced it, silently, then aloud like a fool. Te amo. Te quiero. He told the dark what he did not yet have the right to tell a person. It did not answer. It was okay. He had scarcely begun.",

The room was an old classroom that had decided it would be a community center now, the chalkboards painted over and a string of paper suns hanging limp above an air conditioner that had given up in another decade. David stood in the back with his arms crossed and his eyes soft, and a girl with a purple backpack held a plastic tiara between her teeth while she drew a fox. Benjamin opened a book with a rabbit on the cover and remembered how many stories were about someone trying to leave home and how many ended with someone getting lost, and then how many of those made the getting lost feel like a place you could live in for a while.\n\nHe began in English because that was what his mouth did when scared. Then he stopped and started again in Spanish, slow at first, each syllable like a step on stones across water. The words were for children but carried a weight that surprised him, a weight that was not the opposite of light. The kids listened the way kids listen when the adult is doing something potentially embarrassing and might need to be rescued, which is to say with attention disguised as boredom. He said conejo and a boy in a red shirt corrected him so gently it felt like being handed a cup of water. He said bosque and the girl with the tiara in her mouth said, you can make it softer, like you\u2019re telling the trees they\u2019re safe. He laughed and tried again, and when he got it right, two of them nodded with the solemnity of judges and he felt something inside him unclench without making it a scene.\n\nAfterward a small boy named Mario stood close and asked, in English, if Benjamin knew any stories where the rabbit didn\u2019t win. Benjamin told him about rabbits and foxes, about stories where the clever animal is not the rabbit or where the fox is tired of being evil. He asked Mario if he knew any, and Mario told him one about a turtle who just stopped and sighed and said, today I don\u2019t want to race, and everybody left him alone and that was the end. Benjamin said, that\u2019s a good story, and Mario looked at him like he had given him a gift and didn\u2019t want to make a big deal of it.\n\nOn his way out, Jill was at the door putting flyers under a magnet shaped like Utah with the upper corner chipped off so it looked like the state was wincing. She adjusted her tote bag and asked, without ceremony, if he would come next week. He said yes with less hesitation than he had expected from himself, and when she nodded, he realized that he had been waiting for a woman who wore seriousness like an accessory to approve of him in this specific way. She said something about how the kids could smell effort and mercy both, and he said something about how he would bring oranges, and she said, bring napkins too, because oranges make lines on the floor that become evidence.\n\nWork ran like a machine beside all of this and sometimes through it. He sat in meetings where debt service coverage ratios and amortization schedules made a tidy kind of music, and in those same meetings he found himself listening to a foreman who had come along for the owner, the man\u2019s hands cut and dark at the knuckles, and tried out, quietly, a question in Spanish about the timing of deliveries. The foreman answered in a sigh of relief like a car\u2019s engine turning after weeks in snow, and the owner looked grateful and a little surprised, which was its own kind of math. Later, in the elevator, a coworker in a tie that looked expensive enough to be told the truth asked if he was picking up something for a woman and Benjamin said, yes, language, and the coworker laughed like a joke had been delivered on time.\n\nSaturday was the gallery opening that made Mara write \u201cmicrogreens, help me\u201d with four slanted exclamation points. He stood in front of his mirror in a shirt that made him look like he had tried, then disarranged it deliberately so he didn\u2019t scare himself. The gallery was all white and comment, every surface prepared for witnesses. The lighting did that thing where it found the best in everything and made it look inevitable. People gathered in clusters that arranged themselves like small economies, independent but narrating the same story. He felt foolish for five minutes, then stopped feeling foolish and started feeling like someone looking at a map with all the cities marked in a language he could almost read if he tilted his head.\n\nMara moved through it not like someone who belonged but like someone who could teach belonging. She wore a black dress that complicated the idea of simple and a pair of earrings that might have been practical except that they weren\u2019t. When she saw him she came to him the way you come to a place you remember from childhood: completely, and then with a check of whatever internal watch tells you the seconds that matter. He had brought a bottle of something forgettable and she took it as if it was exactly right and put it behind the bar and then confessed she didn\u2019t know where anything went. He asked if she needed help and she said, always, and then told him to please talk to people and to not try to be useful because that would be the most useful thing.\n\nTom\u00e1s appeared beside her the way a person with rights to a room appears. He was wearing a suit that had found his shoulders and decided to adopt them. He shook Benjamin\u2019s hand and said the right words in the right order in a voice that ran smooth where Benjamin\u2019s had burrs. They stood together for a moment, three people pretending they were not measuring anything. Tom\u00e1s asked Benjamin what he did at the bank, and Benjamin told him in a sentence that was true and small, and Tom\u00e1s nodded as if he had been given a weather report, then turned to greet a couple whose laughter had arrived before they had. Tamsin swept in and told Mara she had saved something with a placement and that also she had ruined something else with another placement and how wonderful to do both in the same hour, and then kissed Benjamin on the cheek like he was a person at sea they had all agreed would reach shore.\n\nA photographer asked Mara if he could take her picture next to a painting of water that refused to admit it was blue, and Mara agreed and then positioned herself to look like she hadn\u2019t. Benjamin watched the flash mark the room and thought about how light pretends to be not heavy and is always lying. He found himself talking to a man about a sculpture made of bent nails and agricultural twine, and the man told him a story about his father\u2019s hands, and then suddenly he and the man were both a little embarrassed by how easily they had been led there. He ate something green on a chip that had been warned not to break, and then he did break it, and it felt good to be ungentle for once.\n\nHe didn\u2019t drink more than he could carry home, which meant he didn\u2019t drink much. On his way out to breathe air that had not been informed of its responsibilities, he ran into Caleb smoking, his grin set at 70 percent mischief. Caleb asked him if he had liked the poem on the wall with the red string and Benjamin said he had liked the string, and they both pretended that was a conversation about art. Caleb asked about the kids at the center, and when Benjamin told him about Mario and the turtle, Caleb\u2019s face softened and then sharpened, like he had put away something that might have been kind and replaced it with something that would survive. He flicked his cigarette into a bucket that had a label that said NOT WATER written in marker like an accusation, and then went back inside as if the place were a sentence he had left unfinished.\n\nOn Sunday his mother called and asked him to come over for dinner, which meant the table would be set in the particular correct way and the roast would be overdone in the exact right direction. He arrived with a pie he hadn\u2019t made and his father opened the door as if the house had been needing fresh air. The first five minutes were always about shoes and whether the porch light worked and if the lawn had discovered the audacity to yellow, and then they would move to the careful topics as if they had coordinates. They ate mashed potatoes and talked about gas prices with the gravitas worthy of a funeral, and then his mother asked about work and his father asked how the Jazz were playing in the postseason as if the outcome had been in doubt in heaven.\n\nWhen he said he was volunteering with kids after school on Tuesdays and reading to them in Spanish, his mother put down her fork in the way she did when she didn\u2019t want to drop it. She said that sounded good, and his father said, in that voice you use when you are trying to be helpful and it comes out like a warning, that Rose Park had changed and you had to be careful where you parked after dark and that he remembered when he had driven a route up there and how some corners kept the evening too long. Benjamin said the kids were fine and he went before it was dark and that the most dangerous thing that had happened was that a rabbit hadn\u2019t won, and his mother laughed even though she didn\u2019t get it and asked if he was dating anyone and he said he was learning the imperfect tense and there was a pause that lasted exactly as long as it takes to decide to sigh.\n\nHe did what he always did, which was to not pick the fight and to feel the fight buzz around him like something that might land later. After dessert, his mother stood with him at the sink and asked what the tutor\u2019s name was, and he said Mara, and his mother said, lovely, and not in a way that meant anything other than the shape of the word in her mouth. He dried plates while she told him about Sister Jensen\u2019s cousin\u2019s grandson who had made partner at a firm whose name sounded like a cough, and he nodded and looked out the window at the mountains that had never asked to be described as anyone\u2019s witness and were anyway.\n\nWhen he left, he drove the slow way back to the city. You could cut onto the freeway and count the miles like a person impatient to end a paragraph, or you could let the road curl around itself, past the cemetery where the headstones looked like teeth, past the view that had been sold a thousand times as if it were mineable. The air had the late-spring smell of a place that would be like it was forever for three days, and then not anymore. He rolled the window down and listened to an old woman on a porch talking to a dog as if the dog were responsible for the economy, and he loved the woman for thinking it might be.\n\nMara texted him on Monday afternoon: \u201cImperfect tomorrow. Bring your best memories and your worst.\u201d He sent back a half-hearted emoji and then wrote, \u201cI will bring the time I almost went on a mission and the way I didn\u2019t,\u201d and then almost deleted it, and then didn\u2019t. She wrote, \u201cAh,\u201d and then she wrote, \u201cI suppose we will conjugate regret,\u201d and he felt grateful for someone who would not let him position himself as either tragic or brave.\n\nAt the library, they took a table by the windows and watched a storm organize itself with unnecessary theatrics over the foothills. The glass kept the lightning polite and made the thunder feel like a rumor. She wrote on their shared page: quer\u00eda, pod\u00eda, pensaba, sol\u00eda, and said, this is where you get to be messy, and then promptly made him be precise. He told her that he used to go to early-morning seminary and sometimes he would sit in a parking lot afterward and not know if it had been a good idea to wake up, and she asked if he had wanted the mornings, in that way you can want something and want it gone, and he said yes, and then tried to say it in Spanish and fell over his own mouth and she picked him up and dusted him off with a look.\n\nHe asked her what she used the imperfect for, and she said everything that refuses to end. She said summers, and the smell of tortillas, and her grandmother humming a song without words while folding laundry, and the way she used to count coins to see how close it was to the month. He asked her if you could use it for wanting, and she said, absolutely, she used it that way all the time, but that sometimes the preterite is honest, sometimes you wanted and then you stopped. He said he was not the preterite type and she laughed and said nobody is until they are.\n\nThe library lost power for ten minutes and everybody reacted as if this had been the plan. A child near them squealed with delight and a man by the register muttered as if the electricity owed him a personal apology. They went outside and sat on the steps and watched the rain attempt to make grand entrances at three places on the plaza and get interrupted by wind each time. Mara bought two paletas from a cart whose umbrella was attempting to become a bird, and handed him one that tasted like mango pretending to be something more grown up. He said thank you in Spanish and she said de nada and then, because she was a contrary, she said, you\u2019re welcome, too, and his desire to lay his head against her shoulder felt like a very small boat looking at a very large ocean and considering its chances.\n\nHe didn\u2019t, and he was proud of himself and also a little sad. The power came back on and people clapped because they were people. They went back in and conjugated survival until the hour felt satisfied. When he apologized for telling her too many things and making language into a confessional, she waved her hand and said she would invoice him for time and secrets both and that he should bring more secrets because they made good practice, and he said, you are very kind to charge me for therapy at a tutoring rate, and she said, I could up my prices, and he said, please don\u2019t, and they both smiled and then looked away.\n\nAt work the next day, he said no to a man with a plan that would have made him money and also made him more absent, and he said yes to a woman who had a produce business that made sense at the margins and didn\u2019t anywhere else, which meant he called someone else and asked for a favor, which meant he had to cash a small chip he\u2019d meant to save for something that would benefit him more. He walked down Main at lunch and ate a burrito that was too much food for a single person and then ate it anyway out of respect for the person who had made it. He stopped in Rancho Market and bought a bag of limes only to stand in line for two minutes and listen, as she had told him to do months ago, and he heard a woman scold gently and a man reply with a joke that belonged only to that place, and he loved being allowed to hear that more than almost anything that week.\n\nHe tried, at night, to write a poem in Spanish. It was a terrible poem that could not decide whether to bow or make demands, and it featured a horse because Sor Juana had given him one and he didn\u2019t know how to give it back. He wrote tres versiones of the same line about heat and only one of them didn\u2019t sound like a mistranslated warning on a hairdryer. He read it out loud and it was worse out loud. He texted Jill to ask if there was an open mic where he could embarrass himself and she wrote back, not tonight, don\u2019t be ridiculous, but come on Thursday and listen to other people be brave, and he said yes because he had made it a practice to say yes to people whose eyes had a certain steel in them.\n\nThursday night, he stood in the back of a room with a microphone and a stool and a lot of expectations. People took turns standing up and telling the truth badly and beautifully. Caleb read something that started out like a joke about name tags and turned into a fierce little thing about who gets to call you what, and there was a line about water that made three people shift in their seats and made Benjamin understand that jealous and admiring are doors that lead to the same sudden drop. He clapped with everyone else and then went home and wrote a note to himself that said, not now, but do not act like a person who is not doing anything.\n\nLate in June, Mara texted him at eleven, which was rare. \u201cAre you awake,\u201d she wrote, which was a question that didn\u2019t need answering because he always was, lately, the way summer makes black coffee of sleep. He wrote back that he was awake and that his sink had water and his walls had ears but they weren\u2019t mean. She asked if she could call, and then she did without waiting, and her voice was the voice of someone walking home in heels with her shoes in her hands. She told him about a collector who had wanted her to pose with a sculpture in a photograph for a magazine he would print himself and never show to anyone, just to know he had printed it, and how she had said no and then yes and then no again and how it felt like performing honesty in a mirror. He said the correct minimum and the correct extra and she laughed a little at his correct extra and said she would be better at boundaries next week and he said he was already proud of last week and also this one, and she was quiet for a second and said, you are dangerous because you talk like that, and he said, I learned it from poets and bankers, and she said that was either charming or chilling and she\u2019d decide in the morning.\n\nIn early July the heat came in and set down bags and declared itself a resident. The swamp coolers on the roofline did their best to make it feel like July in a different decade. The mountains faded each late afternoon and then appeared again like a trick that had been perfected over a century. Mara warned him she would miss a Tuesday and he responded as if he were not disappointed, and then she missed two and he went to the center and read a book about a dog who wanted to be a moon and was told by a six-year-old that dogs cannot be moons because they are already stars. He told Jill he felt foolish showing up with oranges when half the kids had eaten their weight in paletas and she told him, juice makes stains that make memories, do it anyway.\n\nHe ran into Tom\u00e1s once at a coffee shop where the espresso was a little too proud of itself. Tom\u00e1s was holding a stack of catalogs and talked about a fair in New York and a museum in Denver and said, without making it sound like a warning, that Mara was going places this summer. Benjamin said, that\u2019s good, and Tom\u00e1s said, yes, in a way that contained many things, including the suspicion that Benjamin was being asked to keep up and might not want to run. They stood and said the things that men say when neither of them has a claim to the topic but both feel obliged to speak, and then they smiled at the same time and retreated, polite to the last.\n\nMore than once, Benjamin imagined walking into the gallery and asking Mara to leave with him. Not in a dramatic way, not as if he were rescuing anyone, but as a way of asking whether her feet would choose his sidewalk for a moment. He did not do it. He went in and looked at a painting of a kitchen in Oaxaca and smelled onions and oil and a floor that had been mopped not recently and felt homesick for a place he had never been. Mara came and stood beside him for a minute and let him stand beside her without speaking, the way you let a dog put its head on your knee when you both know what that means and you both also know it doesn\u2019t, on its own, change anything.\n\nThe imperfect entered his tongue like something that had been waiting for permission. He learned to say I used to, I would always, I was going to, and each one made him feel as if he were telling a friend a secret in the back booth of a diner where the waitress called you hon and meant it. He said quer\u00eda and meant it across two languages, and when he told Mara that he wanted to want correctly, she said there was no correct, only precise, and that precision was a mercy you could give to yourself. He said, I wanted to go on a mission and I did not, and I wanted to want God the way I was told to, and I didn\u2019t, and I wanted to be a certain kind of man and I was another, and she wrote on the page: quer\u00eda, quise, fui, and then said, you are making this sound like a dissertation, and he said, I am a man in a tie, and she said, take the tie off, and he said, no, someone needs to be the man in the tie, and she looked at him like she had just remembered something important and said, that is not always a sentence you should be proud of.\n\nHe visited his parents again and didn\u2019t bring pie, and his mother took this as a sign of something she could not name and so did not mention. They watched a fireworks preview from the backyard because Bountiful celebrates early as if to get a head start on being patriotic and then richly tired. His father told a story about his own father, which he did sometimes and then would pretend to be annoyed with himself for doing. The story was about a winter and a truck and how some things you don\u2019t get to say no to, and Benjamin listened and nodded and then asked, gently, if there were things his father had said no to and been glad later, and his father said, you mean regrets, and Benjamin said, I mean victories, and his father looked at him as if he had been replaced by a man with the same face and then looked away because sometimes looking is lifting something you don\u2019t want to test the weight of.\n\nAfter the fireworks, his mother stood with him on the front lawn and said, very quietly, that she worried about him, and he said, very quietly, that he worried about him too, and she laughed a little and said that was not reassuring and also the most reassuring thing he\u2019d heard, and he kissed the top of her head and said goodnight and drove home with the radio off because sometimes you have to let your thoughts be their own static.\n\nA week later, he and Mara sat at Mestizo because the library was being cleaned in a way that suggested past sins and future squeaks. She was in jeans with paint on them that had not been arranged by an algorithm, and he was in the shirt that made him look like he had tried. They talked about verbs and then they didn\u2019t. She told him she wanted to drive to the lake one evening and sit and smell the brine and count the gulls and feel small but not belittled. He said he wanted to go with her and immediately regretted the way it had come out like a boy asking for an invitation to the cool lunch table, and she saved him by saying maybe with a smile that was not a door, at least not yet.\n\nThey walked out into the heat and it wrapped them like a blanket that had forgotten to be soft. A man at the bus stop argued with a friend no one could see and then apologized to the bench for raising his voice. Mara said she had not slept enough in weeks and that if she took one nap she would never wake up, and he said he dreamed in Spanish sometimes now and the sentences were kinder there, and she said that was because he had put kindness into the language himself. He asked what she dreamed in and she said she dreamed in work and in fear and in a strange peace that sometimes came to her like a hand, and then she said she was being dramatic and he said, no, you\u2019re not, and she rolled her eyes at him and then smiled because the last thing she wanted was a man agreeing too earnestly and the second to last thing she wanted was a man not listening.\n\nWhen they parted, he turned and watched her cross the street and then kept watching until she was on the other sidewalk. A gust of dry wind picked up a receipt and made it important for a second, and then put it down when it realized there was no script for it. He looked up at the mountain and thought about the way it had been described to him his whole life as something permanent and then how living in its shadow had taught him that permanence is just change with a long gait. He went home and cut into a cold orange and ate it over the sink and thought about a line he could not remember precisely from Sor Juana about the mind and the body or maybe about wanting and knowing and how they make jokes at each other\u2019s expense.\n\nOn a night when sleep was a dare, he stood on his porch again and watched a couple across the street rehearse the same quiet fight he had seen before. He had learned some of their Spanish and some of their sign language, the way the woman\u2019s hands made the shape of no without three letters in it and the way the man sat down even when standing would have been more dramatic. He loved them more than was appropriate for people he did not know, and he made a promise to no one in particular not to turn them into metaphors for his own purposes, and then failed and did it anyway, because he was a person and not a saint.\n\nHe texted Mara before midnight because he was weak and also because he had learned that sometimes you send the message you will regret and then you discover that regret can be a small price. He wrote, \u201cHoy le\u00ed a los ni\u00f1os. Ellos me corrigieron. Fue perfecto,\u201d and he put his phone face down and left it and then picked it up immediately because he was not a man who could wait for the world to do what it would do. She wrote back, \u201cEso es todo. Guardas esas correcciones como si fueran pan,\u201d and then added, \u201cGracias por seguir,\u201d and then, \u201cNo te mueras de calor,\u201d and he wrote back, \u201cNo me muero nada,\u201d and then realized that was not precisely right and corrected himself with the little star and she sent him a row of clapping hands as if he had rounded a base with his eyes open.\n\nThe heat deepened and flattened. The city kept breathing. He put his mouth around the imperfect again and again until it stopped feeling like a trick and started feeling like a room. He was thirty-five and he was talking like a man who had finally decided to believe his own mouth. He was not who he had been when he dialed a torn number taped to a counter, and he was not yet who he would be when the snow came back. He was practicing being a person whose wants had grammar, and whose grammar might save him from himself one long afternoon at a time. He could say I was going to love you and mean it without apology to the tense. He could say I used to be quiet and leave it on the table without anybody needing to pick it up and fix it. He could say, I would go to the lake, and he could wait for the answer without throwing his heart into the water first.\n\nWhen the first thunderstorm of July unrolled itself like a sermon you weren\u2019t sure you agreed with but loved the sound of, he went out to the porch again and leaned on the railing and watched the rain come in sideways. A teen in a white shirt stripped to the waist and stood under the downspout and made a performance of ecstasy that was perhaps sincere and perhaps for girls watching from a car and perhaps both. Benjamin laughed out loud and then stopped laughing because he was alone and it feels different to laugh alone. He whispered the imperfect to himself, the way a person will drum their fingers on a counter when they\u2019re waiting for a kettle. Quer\u00eda. Pod\u00eda. Sol\u00eda. And, in the dark, to no one and to himself, he tried, softly, a thing he had promised not to try without permission. Te quer\u00eda. He let the sentence sit with him like a dog at his feet that was not his dog but had decided to keep him company for a while. He hoped he would be forgiven for the practice. He thought, not for the first time, that there are worse sins than rehearsing kindness. He thought, not for the last time, that the only way out was through, a word at a time, with care and with errors and with the weather, which would always be more interesting than any of his stories and would make room for them anyway.",

                              "content": "Chapter 5\n\nBy the time the Days of \u201947 parade took over State Street and the floats moved like stubborn icebergs between bleachers of sunburn, the heat had found every crack and crawled in to stay. Flags wilted at the edge, drums slapped themselves awake, and horses did what horses will always do on pavement while a man with a broom walked behind and made modest acts into a service. Benjamin stood in the shade of a plane tree that grudgingly allowed its leaves to play host, a paper cup sweating in his hand. He could feel the city performing a version of itself he had inherited in hymns and handshakes: pioneer as noun and verb. Children waved from wagons dressed as prayers and a group of teens in matching shirts chanted in tones that meant nothing to outsiders and everything to the ones whose shoulders touched. He thought of how you can belong to a story for so long that you forget it\u2019s optional, until one day you realize you can set it down and then spend years reaching out to make sure it hasn\u2019t wandered away without you.\n\nHe sent a message to Mara before he could make it too careful. He wrote, \u201cYou said the lake. This week, when the sun is tired?\u201d The reply came after the marching band, after a cheer team built a human pyramid and made the top girl look brave enough to argue with gravity. \u201cYes,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTomorrow, if your tie can stand it. After the white heat is done pretending.\u201d He looked up at the strip of mountains and thought of the way the lake refused any performance but its own, and he imagined the brine flies lifting as one body and then settling as if they had changed their minds about being air.\n\nThey drove out in his car with the windows down and the air like a hair dryer on low. The causeway cut straight as a certainty and then the water gathered itself on both sides and pretended to be endless. It smelled, as always, like metal remembering salt, like something had been born, and something had died, and both of those things were reasonable. Mara kicked off her sandals and walked several feet ahead of him without needing him to see her do it, her dress moving around her like a sentence in a language that had decided not to be in a hurry. Brine flies startled in sheets and then returned in the same shape as if nothing had happened to them, which was not true and also true.\n\nThey sat on a low rock where someone had scratched the word home and then scratched it out. The water mirrored a sky that had done away with clouds to save everyone the trouble of interpretation. Mara handed him a paleta that had begun to concede to physics; mango again, but with a stripe of something that tasted like lime until it decided it was something else. \u201cWe should practice the future,\u201d she said, squinting at the line where everything pretended to end. \u201cIt\u2019s very arrogant, the future. I like it for that. Sometimes I need to be told what to believe.\u201d\n\nHe rolled amar\u00e9 around his mouth as if it were a hard candy he hadn\u2019t asked for. He said ir\u00e9 and the word made a small promise he wasn\u2019t sure he had earned the right to make. He said podremos and the plural felt like a handshake offered toward something he was still learning how to touch. Mara took a small stone and drew nothing on the salt, then watched the wind erase it with a thoroughness that felt personal. \u201cBe careful with the future,\u201d she said, not looking at him, the way you look out at water when you are discussing land. \u201cPeople like us put it on like a jacket and then we forget that weather happens anyway.\u201d\n\nHe asked her, very quietly, to tell him what us meant, and she nodded like he had asked a good question and did not answer. She told him instead about a night last week when she had stood in a kitchen in a house on the hill and watched a woman slice peaches like she was rich in time, and how the room had made her feel tender and then angry and then tender again until she was tired of herself. He told her about his father\u2019s laugh that came like a cough at the wrong time and how he had always loved it anyway, and she smiled like she was recognizing a distant relative in a crowd and then waved. He told her about wanting to stand between his job and the parts of his city that were already telling jokes about the people who would have to move when the punchline landed, and she put her hand on his wrist and said, \u201cDon\u2019t please perform decency for me. Just hold it.\u201d\n\nThey walked the waterline where the salt made small castles and then crushed them without regret. A boy threw stones and made the lake pretend to be wounded in a thousand concentric circles. A woman in a sunhat posed her dog against a backdrop of everything and the dog obliged with a dignity that seemed practiced. Benjamin said voy a intentarlo and meant a dozen things at once, and Mara said bien and meant at least two. When he said te querr\u00e9 without letting it be for her, she turned her face toward him and then away, as if the sun had managed to surprise her. \u201cNo me prometas nada que no puedas pagar,\u201d she said, and turned the sentence into a joke by letting the banker sit in it for a minute before she laughed and let him out.\n\nOn the way back he told her a story about a client who was a cousin of someone famous enough to be recognized at the gas station and how that had made the loan simultaneously more annoying and less interesting. She countered with a story about a collector who insisted on being called by a nickname he had invented for himself and how everyone obeyed because it is hard, in some rooms, to tell the truth without losing the thread. They drove in companionable not-speaking most of the way down the causeway, the lake finding its smell and forcing it through the vents no matter how they tried to hold it off. He held the wheel and thought about the line where pretends-to-be-end-water-a-sky traded names with itself until both were bored and then went back to work.\n\nIn Rose Park the next week, the swamp cooler wheezed and gave up and Jill stood on a chair and smacked it with the handle of a broom like she was reminding a stubborn animal it had a purpose. The room sagged and then took a breath and then did both again, and the kids made a game of not complaining. Benjamin read a book about a boy who thought he was a wolf until he remembered he was not and found this disappointing and freeing at the same time. Halfway through, the power played a trick it had learned from the storm at the library and died, and then somehow the story seemed more honest in the long, thin quiet. He stood still and let his mouth remember what it had memorized and the kids leaned back in their chairs and counted bug bites on their ankles like rosary beads.\n\nWhen it was over, a mother in a green shirt with a bleach mark in the shape of the state asked him in Spanish if he was the one at the bank who had helped her cousin with a truck. He said maybe, because trucks were everywhere and so were cousins, and she said her cousin\u2019s voice had sounded different for a week, more like someone had moved a box off it. He said he was happy to be a box-mover when he could be, and she handed him a bag of tamales he had not deserved and told him not to be silly. Jill caught his eye and raised an eyebrow the way you ask, you okay, and he nodded, because he was increasingly convinced that okay lives in smaller rooms than triumph and is more comfortable furniture.\n\nAt work, a proposal slid across his desk with the kind of friction paper makes when it knows it is loaded. It was for eight townhomes that would look correct in a brochure and very strange on the block where they were planned. The spreadsheet did a little dance his mind could follow with its eyes closed, but down in the notes was a sentence about \u201credevelopment opportunity\u201d that had a scent like someone had left the stove on. He sat with it for an hour, then brought it to his boss, who wore his competence like a pressed shirt, and said he wanted the covenants to require a percentage of units rented below market to people who already lived within two miles or something like that, broad enough to matter and narrow enough to push back on a word he didn\u2019t want to use in a meeting. His boss looked at him like he had suggested moving a river with a spoon and then said they could see, which is a way of saying no that leaves both parties a door.\n\nHe walked down Main at lunch with a sandwich that was smarter than it looked and ran into David, who was carrying a case of bottled water as if it had applied for a job on his back. They sat on a low wall and talked about kids and cooling units and donors who want their name on things and donors who want to be ghosts. Benjamin told him about the townhomes and his idea, and David listened and then said, \u201cIf it keeps two grandmothers near the school they love, I\u2019ll bake you a cake. If it keeps one, I\u2019ll buy you a pie.\u201d Benjamin said he didn\u2019t do it for dessert and David said, \u201cYou better not, my cakes are terrible,\u201d and the joke landed gently because both of them had chosen their rooms on purpose and were trying not to bring furniture that would scratch the floors.\n\nMara sent a picture of a sculpture that looked like a whale\u2019s ribcage and a question about whether it was cruel to show it next to a painting of a thin woman eating air. He wrote back, \u201cCruel to whom,\u201d and she sent a string of emoji that somehow conveyed a lecture shorthand and then wrote, \u201cCome Thursday. There will be speeches I want to mock and also respect, and I need someone to lean into without it becoming a new habit.\u201d He had learned enough to know that sentence had a trapdoor under it, but he said yes anyway like a person who was tired of trying to outsmart his own heart.\n\nHe brought nothing to the opening but himself and the shirt that meant trying. The room glowed with the smug light gallery owners buy in bulk. People used words like \u201cgesture\u201d and \u201cinterrogates\u201d and sometimes they meant them and sometimes they didn\u2019t, and Benjamin found he didn\u2019t mind either outcome as much as he would have three months ago. Mara gave him that whole-faced greeting she reserved for exactly five seconds and then remembered her watch. She placed him beside a man in a denim jacket who introduced himself as a photographer of blue hours, and then she was called away by a woman who said her name like a brand, and he stood and listened to the denim jacket talk about windows and the way glass thinks it is innocent until it knows better.\n\nTom\u00e1s floated near and looked very tired in the way people do when they have spent the day being admired and now have to pretend they are fine with that. He nodded to Benjamin and asked him what he thought of a piece in which wire had been coaxed into something that might be a cage or a cloud, and Benjamin said he was undecided and that was the point he liked best, and Tom\u00e1s\u2019s mouth did a small, unwilling smile that made him look less like an elevator. \u201cShe is good at placing,\u201d Tom\u00e1s said, letting the pronoun work for him, and Benjamin said she was good at many things he wasn\u2019t going to list for someone who already knew, and they stood together feeling civilized and not particularly dangerous.\n\nHe left before the speeches ended and walked home with his tie loosened, his collar attempting to be a person. On his porch he ate one of the tamales he shouldn\u2019t have opened that late at night, the corn coming apart in a way that felt forgiving. He wrote a poem in bad Spanish about wire and weather and what people put near each other to trick themselves into understanding, and the poem was worse than many of his worst and better than some of his better, and he put it away without sending it to anyone. The thunder in the distance sounded like chairs being arranged for a gathering and then put back when the host lost courage.\n\nAt his parents\u2019 house the following Sunday, his mother had a new salad recipe that involved quinoa, a word that still felt like a secret handshake she had said yes to. His father told him a story about when the freeway hadn\u2019t been a fact yet, and Benjamin tried to imagine driving into the city without that river of an assumption. They ate without praying out loud, which still felt like an omission that had to be compensated for with extra politeness. After the peaches, his mother refolded a washcloth with more attention than necessary and asked, with that practiced lilt, if he had seen Sister Evans\u2019s new baby, the one with cheeks like bread. He said he had not and probably would, eventually, and she said, \u201cWell,\u201d and then sat down with a soft thud that meant she was trying a new approach. \u201cYou seem,\u201d she said, and paused because there are words that resist being named in front of the people they belong to, \u201cyou seem a little more yourself lately. I don\u2019t know if I like all of it, and that is my job, but I like that part.\u201d\n\nHe told her about the kids and oranges and the Great Salt Lake as if these were all facets of one item on a receipt he could not return. He told her about writing poems and then never reading them to anyone, and she said, in genuine confusion, why would you do that, and he laughed and said, to be a person, and she said, I thought people read things to each other all the time now, and he said, only the brave and the very drunk, and she made the face of a woman remembering something she would not say out loud and then said, anyway, be careful with what you bring into your mouth. He promised he would, knowing he was lying, and also not.\n\nHe did read once, though. He went to the open mic Jill had sent him the flyer for and stood at the back and reconsidered his life choices and then decided there were worse places to reconsider them. When his name was called\u2014because he had written it down without believing in the future\u2014he walked to the front feeling like a man who had borrowed his own shoes. He read the poem about wire and weather and did not translate it to English because he wanted to honor the part of him that had to strain. He mispronounced one word in a way that made it sound dirtier and better and everyone generously pretended they didn\u2019t notice, and when he looked up he saw Mario\u2019s older sister in the second row with a friend, both of them giving him the same tight-lipped respectful face kids give adults when they are doing something embarrassing well. After, Caleb clapped him on the shoulder and said, \u201cYou made a shape,\u201d and then lit a cigarette as if to undo any sincerity that might linger, and Benjamin went home and did not sleep for a long time but also did not regret.\n\nLate in July, a noise pulled him upright at five in the morning, a sound like a hundred small creatures deciding to move house at once. The bed wobbled, the picture frames looked ashamed, and then it was over. He texted Mara without checking the clock: \u201c\u00bfLo sentiste?\u201d She wrote back: \u201cS\u00ed. Todav\u00eda tiemblo.\u201d He stared at those words until they lost their grammar and became simply a report from someone he wanted to hear breathing. Later that day he met with the developer of the townhomes, a man with a haircut like a promise, and asked for the covenant out loud. The man laughed with his tongue against his teeth and said, he appreciated the sentiment, and Benjamin said, the bank can attach conditions to this credit, and the man shrugged and said, then attach them, and the shrug contained both a dare and a calculation about how much the market would erase what men like Benjamin tried to write. He left the meeting and walked into heat that had nothing to say about any of it and went to the library and read the lines in Sor Juana where a mind refuses to be told what it wants and felt less like an intruder than he had three months ago.\n\nMara called him at midnight two nights later with a voice like a pen that had run out of ink and then found more. She told him that she had told Tom\u00e1s no to something that looked like an opportunity and that his face had done a thing she wished she had not loved noticing. She told him that she had been at a dinner where the forks were heavier than his mortgage and that she had flirted with the idea of being very good at it for a living, and then she had gone home and written a paragraph in Spanish about a girl who watched her mother count bottles on a shelf. He listened and offered the correct minimum and then a little extra, and when she said, \u201cNo me ayudes demasiado,\u201d he said, \u201cEst\u00e1 bien,\u201d and peeled an orange quietly with one hand because his other hand had forgotten it could do more than hold a voice.\n\nHe asked her to come with him to Bountiful to watch the early fireworks and she said not yet, but tell me about the way your mother folds napkins, and he did, and she made a small appreciative sound a person makes when something unexpected turns out to be exactly how they wanted it. He asked her to come with him to the ballpark he and his father had sat in many years ago, the one that still smelled like peanuts and sunscreen and hope no matter the decade, and she said maybe and meant no, and he said okay and meant try again later, and both of them were honest and neither was entirely brave.\n\nThe townhomes did get their covenant, a narrow one, attached like a scarf to a coat that would not have known it was missing anything. His boss looked at him with an expression halfway between amused and pleased and said, \u201cWell, you did a thing,\u201d and Benjamin said, with excessive humility, that he had, and then walked to the center on Tuesday and read about a rabbit who had grown tired of being accused of speed and had decided to take up painting. The children corrected him less and then more, as if to remind him they were paying attention, and Jill handed him a paper cup of water like a sacrament and told him he was stubborn in ways that made him useful and exhausting. He said, \u201cI can change,\u201d and she said, \u201cI hope not,\u201d and the air conditioner decided to be a friend again for fifteen minutes and everyone clapped, because people do.\n\nAugust made itself known with mornings that tasted like metal and afternoons that tasted like dust. The mountains faded and returned in their ritual, and his apartment learned how to be hot without apology. He took to keeping oranges in the fridge and standing with the door open longer than he needed to. He and Mara met at odd hours when her schedule allowed and when her schedule pressed its thumb down on her throat and said hush. Sometimes she was early and they talked about nothing and everything with the giddy competence of people who could pick up a thread without wondering where they had left the spool. Sometimes she was late and he practiced not performing disappointment, and sometimes he failed that test and she let him fail without rewarding it.\n\nOne evening she did say yes to the lake again, and he picked her up without a plan and they drove until the light leaned away. This time the flies were lazier and the air was warmer and the line between water and sky had forgotten to be crisp. They sat, and she told him the story of her father\u2019s first month at the welding shop, how he had burned his hand and not told anyone and gone home and plunged it into a sink and hissed like an animal and her mother had wrapped it in a towel warmed in the dryer and said his name in a way that made it into a sentence with a period and then a dash and then his name again. He told her the story of his almost-mission and how he had packed and then unpacked and how he had learned it was possible to disappoint people and survive and how that didn\u2019t mean he had liked it. She leaned into him for a minute like she was checking if his shoulder was the same as anyone else\u2019s, and then she sat up straight as if she had heard her name called from the water.\n\nHe didn\u2019t kiss her. He thought about it like a person considers stepping onto ice, and then he didn\u2019t, and she noticed not the not-kissing but the way his hand found the rock beside him and made a fist. \u201cYou\u2019re a good man,\u201d she said, and then made a face at herself, and corrected herself, \u201cYou are trying to be,\u201d and he said, \u201cBetter grade,\u201d and they laughed like people who were trying not to give their laughter jobs. On the drive back she fell asleep for seven minutes and he watched the road with that kind of attention that turns your heartbeat into a traffic report, and when she woke up she pretended she hadn\u2019t been asleep and then admitted it immediately, and he said, \u201cEstabas,\u201d and she said, \u201cMuy bien,\u201d and he felt that he had used the imperfect correctly and also the other thing.\n\nToward the end of the month, Tamsin announced a weekend in Park City for a fair that involved art and money and the idea of both in high altitudes. Mara invited him with all her warning bells, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t. But if you do, understand it will be uncomfortable, and I won\u2019t be your anything and you\u2019ll have to watch me be a thing that will make you mad and sad and proud and I don\u2019t know in what order.\u201d He went the first day and wore sunglasses like armor and a shirt he did not care about and watched as people did what they do with weather and funds and taste. He saw Mara move with purpose and sweetness and a practiced disinterest that made her kindness look sharper, and he hated and admired that he loved watching her do it.\n\nOn a balcony that looked over houses whose heated driveways had more technology than the public schools he knew, Mara stood between Tom\u00e1s and Tamsin, listening to a man talk about a sculpture he had no intention of buying with the hunger of a priest hearing confession from a king. She caught Benjamin\u2019s eye for a second and lifted her glass just enough to make it an acknowledgment rather than a request, and he lifted his paper cup of water back and felt like a person who had chosen, for once, the correct modest thing on purpose. Caleb came out of a room, looking like he had gotten lost in a closet full of linen and found himself, and leaned against the railing and read a text and made a face at no one that Benjamin recognized because he had made it too.\n\nOn the drive down the canyon, he didn\u2019t put on music. The headlights ahead of him made a ribbon and someone on a motorcycle caught the late air on their shoulders like a brag they had not earned. He said sentences in the future tense because he wanted to hear the verbs make promises. He said, \u201cIr\u00e9 al centro cada martes,\u201d and tried not to ask what would happen when the snow made the week close in on itself. He said, \u201cHar\u00e9 lo que puedo,\u201d and felt the shape of can in his mouth like a coin that had been in circulation and still had the face on it. He said, very quietly, \u201cTe querr\u00e9 ma\u00f1ana,\u201d and then, because he was trying to do what Mara had told him, he changed it to \u201cTe quiero hoy,\u201d and then he didn\u2019t say it out loud again, because sometimes practice risks becoming a vow before you\u2019ve meant it to, and vows ask to be fed.\n\nAugust ended the way a song ends at a wedding when the DJ has misjudged the crowd. The light lingered a second longer and then packed itself up and drove away. Benjamin stood on his porch one night and watched as his neighbor dragged a fan up the stairs and a woman two houses down yelled into a phone in a language he barely knew and he decided he loved the fact that he barely knew it and could still tell she would forgive the person on the other end if they said the right three words. He peeled an orange, careful, and held the peel to his nose until the oil stung in a way he liked. He thought of the first day at the library and the way Mara had said patient and meant it and the way she had said sliding and looked at him because she knew, and he thought of his father\u2019s hands and his mother\u2019s folding and the brine flies deciding they could be wild for an hour and then going back to work. He thought of peninsulas and causeways and the rooms he walked into now without hating himself for not having the right words.\n\nOn a Tuesday when the air teased rain and then laughed at itself, he arrived at the center with a stack of books and a bag of limes because he had learned something new about how kids will put salt and chili on anything and make it better. Mario had a new haircut that made him look older in the way boys look older when someone else cut their hair in a kitchen. The girl with the tiara had switched to a paper crown and said its weight was different and she wasn\u2019t sure she liked the metaphors people were trying to feed her. They read a book about a house that refused to be demolished because it remembered too many birthdays, and afterward David made a speech about moving the reading hour back when school started and how this meant they would need more volunteers and also more patience. Benjamin raised his hand without meaning to and said, \u201cS\u00ed,\u201d and then repeated it in English even though nobody needed him to, just to make it official to himself.\n\nHe walked home into a wind that had found its humor and stopped in front of the gallery because the door was open and the air made a little current like the room had learned electricity. Mara was there, hair up, neck bare, looking like someone had remembered to tell her she existed. She saw him and came to him and touched his elbow and then let her hand fall, and said, \u201cI sold something today that I didn\u2019t love, and I said no to something I did, and I don\u2019t know if that meant I did it right,\u201d and he said he was proud of her without asking to hear the details, and she leaned her head in toward him without resting it anywhere and said, \u201cYou are very dangerous when you keep your mouth closed,\u201d and he said, \u201cI am practicing,\u201d and she laughed and went back to her counter and he stood in front of a painting of an onion and decided that sometimes performance and sincerity are cousins who have learned to live together without fighting every night.\n\nHe slept later than he should have and woke with a list inside his body of things that would not be written down. He showered and practiced the future again because it was there, and then he walked to the bank and went up to his floor and sat at his desk and looked at the mountains and said to himself in a voice he had started to trust, \u201cHar\u00e9 lo que pueda,\u201d and then he added in English, \u201cand then I\u2019ll do a little more,\u201d and the blinking cursor didn\u2019t look like a heart beating too fast anymore. It looked like a metronome you could either dance to or ignore. He opened the loan package and started reading the notes he had written to himself in a Spanish that had been hard won and found them insufficient in a way that made him want to keep writing them anyway.\n\nAt dusk, he went back to the lake alone, because he wanted to see if it would be different without the pressure of being observed by someone he wanted to impress. It was the same, mean and beautiful and honest, and a boy in a white shirt balanced on a rock and pretended to be a bird while his mother pretended not to see so he could become one without having to explain. The salt was kind to his shoes and cruel to his nose, and he forgave it for both because that is the bargain you make with places that don\u2019t promise you anything. He said out loud, softly, \u201cVoy a seguir,\u201d and let the wind slap the words around a little, and then he drove home with the windows down and the radio off, because he wanted to hear the sound of whatever it was he was building that didn\u2019t yet have walls.\n\nWhen he reached his street, his neighbor was sitting on the stoop with his hands on his knees, looking like a man who had finished a thing and was taking the minute after to acknowledge it. Benjamin sat beside him without asking and they watched a skater carve the same line into the cul-de-sac three times and then fall in a way that would be funny later. The neighbor said, in Spanish, that he had fixed his shower, and Benjamin said, in Spanish, that this meant he had conquered a small god, and the neighbor laughed like a man who had earned his water. Somewhere beyond them, fireworks warmed up without permission, and the first little pop sounded like someone trying to make a point politely. He thought of how he would tell Mara that sound and what tense it would demand, and then he decided to wait and find out from her mouth. He had learned this much: to count his verbs like coins and spend them on something other than himself, or at least try.\n\nHe went to bed with Sor Juana on his chest and woke up hours later with the book on the floor and the lights still on, and for once he didn\u2019t punish himself for not being perfect. He made bad eggs and ate them and laughed at himself the way he had promised he wouldn\u2019t, and then he sent a message to Mara that said, \u201cTraigo limes. T\u00fa traes la paciencia,\u201d and then another to Jill that said, \u201cPuedo estar los jueves,\u201d and then he stood at his sink with cold water running and let the ache in his chest be a liveable ache. He was not brave and he was not cowardly. He was a man who had begun, and he had decided, with all due arrogance, to continue.",

The heat let go without apologizing, the mornings turned rinsed and thin, and the mountains put their edges back on. The city began to smell of cut lawns trying one more time and classrooms waking up. At the center, Jill moved the reading hour to that fragile space after school and before dinner, and the kids came in with hair damp from drinking fountains and the specific wildness of children who have kept their bodies in chairs all day and now want to remember they have knees. Benjamin learned how to read quickly and then pause on purpose, learned how to say, in Spanish, \u201cWe will finish on the next page,\u201d and mean it like a promise and a bribe at once. When he left in the dusky light, the air felt loose again on his skin and he loved the way his car\u2019s engine sounded guilty when it started.\n\nAt the bank the quarter-end rituals assembled themselves and then demanded performance. Spreadsheets announced their modest heroics, memos cleared their throats, and a committee decided, in the tone of men choosing hymn numbers, what would be delayed. The townhomes with the narrow covenant returned to his desk in a folder that had acquired fingerprints like a bad secret. The developer came in wearing a jacket that knew it was supposed to be impressive and called Benjamin principled in the way people call you difficult when they intend to be civilized. Benjamin smiled and did not perform humility. After, he took the elevator down to the street and stood with a burrito too hot to hold and watched a group of boys in football jerseys push a sled down the sidewalk yelling in unison, their voices loud enough to talk back to the sky. He thought of covenants like thin stitches and wondered which of them would hold when the fabric pulled.\n\nMara\u2019s messages shifted, then thinned, like a radio wheeling past stations between songs. She sent him a photograph of a crate of pears labeled with a name she knew he would find unreasonably pretty and asked him how to say bruise without making it sound poetic. He sent her a paragraph about bruises anyway, and then the correct word. When he asked if they were on for Tuesday, she wrote that a collector had scheduled a studio visit and her boss had scheduled an event and she had scheduled herself into a pretzel. He typed three versions of a reply and chose the one that said, in Spanish, est\u00e1 bien, nos vemos cuando puedes, which was either saintly or passive depending on what day it reached you. The following afternoon she wrote, Let\u2019s keep the lessons, let\u2019s keep them where they are, not more, not less, and he felt the sentence land on his back like a hand that meant to comfort and also meant to remind him of posture.\n\nOn a Sunday he walked into the back of a chapel where the hymnals had soft covers and the announcements were in two languages. An usher with a kindness that preceded his smile handed him a program and didn\u2019t ask him anything at all. He sat near the door like a man who might need to leave without making a scene and listened to a hymn he knew sung in a language he was trying to deserve. He found that the chords were the same and the vowels were not, and that his chest remembered what to do. When the sacrament tray came to him he passed it on and did not take, and the boy holding it glanced at him with the professionalism of a child doing a job and then looked away without any theater. Outside, after, he stood under a tree whose leaves had decided to make a plan and watched families fit themselves back into minivans. He said to himself, in a whisper he believed he had earned, I would come back here, and then he walked home the long way past a park where two men argued over a chessboard and made each other better.\n\nThe kids at the center wrote stories in September because Jill said the city felt like a pencil and you should always listen to the weather. Mario wrote about a rabbit who put on a backpack and went to school and learned he didn\u2019t have to race every day, only sometimes, and only when it mattered. The girl with the tiara, who had retired crowns in favor of a pink eraser she used as a worry stone, wrote about a fox who wanted to be a librarian and had to bargain with three owls and a landlord. Benjamin sat at a small table and explained the conditional, which felt exactly like teaching someone to plan escape routes with the lights on. He wrote on the board si fuera, har\u00eda, and the kids cheered because the letter j in har\u00eda sounded like making trouble without getting caught. He told them about wishes that start with ojal\u00e1 and which ones deserve to be said out loud, and when he said ojal\u00e1 que llueva paletas, they yelled like he had become briefly good at his job.\n\nWhen his father called on a Tuesday morning and left a message that said only, \u201cCall me,\u201d Benjamin felt his bones step into a line and salute. In the emergency room the lights made everyone look like they had been asked a question they couldn\u2019t answer yet. His father sat on a bed with wires attending to him like attentive nephews and said he had scared his own chest by taking the trash to the curb and back too fast. His mother stood with her purse angled like a small shield. A nurse with eyes that understood men who wanted to make jokes when they were afraid asked if anyone needed a blanket, and Benjamin wanted to tell her yes and then wanted to say he was fine and then finally said, to the nurse and to his mother, s\u00ed, por favor. In the waiting area, a woman tried to explain in Spanish that her son had swallowed a coin and was sorry, he was sorry, he hadn\u2019t meant to, and the receptionist couldn\u2019t hear past the window. Benjamin stepped forward and said, despacio, soy de aqu\u00ed y puedo ayudar un poco, and his mother turned and watched him translate apology to fact and fear to waiting, and later in the car she said, in the quiet voice of a woman practicing something new, that she was proud he had stayed.\n\nHis father went home with a new pill schedule and a reprimand that was really an invitation to be tender with himself. Benjamin slept badly for a week, his own heart practicing outcomes in the dark. He wrote a poem and then tore it in half and then taped it back together and laughed, which felt like progress. He texted Mara something small and true and she answered with a storm of museum acronyms and then, after a minute, with a single clear line: I forget to eat when I am supposed to talk for a living. He wanted to come to the gallery with a sandwich as if he were the solution, and instead he sent a photograph of his father\u2019s pill organizer in the most flattering light he could find, which was the way the afternoon falls onto laminate with more generosity than laminate has earned.\n\nTom\u00e1s found him in a coffee shop that had decided to be serious about beans and laid his catalog down on the table like a court document. He asked, with the brightness of a polite trap, if Benjamin had seen the review, and when Benjamin said he had not, Tom\u00e1s summarized a paragraph in which the show\u2019s restraint saved it from itself and then raised his eyebrows as if asking the world to behave. He said, conversationally, that the gallery had put in for a fair in L.A. and that if they were accepted it would change the pace of the season, and that Mara was very good at pace, and Benjamin said he knew, and Tom\u00e1s\u2019s mouth made a shape that meant he knew Benjamin knew. They talked about weather even though both of them understood they were not.\n\nOne late afternoon the city tried out its first inversion of the year like a sweater it had forgotten was itchy. The sky lowered itself with an air of resignation and the air decided to taste like the memory of toast. From his office window the Oquirrhs retired into rumor and the Wasatch looked like the idea of a mountain and not the thing. He rode the elevator down with a woman who worked two floors below and wore her lanyard like penance, and they both pretended not to breathe shallow, and then they both breathed shallow anyway. At the bottom, the street smelled like engines and the angle of light was such that everybody looked briefly like a person he loved. He walked to the library because it had become, over the last months, the place he went when he wanted to remember there were rooms that made promises and kept them.\n\nMara had canceled their lesson that afternoon with a phrase that was both apology and boundary. He sat by a window anyway and read Sor Juana until his eyes felt properly admonished. Then he took out the small notebook he had bought for poems and budgeting, as if he could trick himself into believing both tasks were practical, and wrote a letter to Mara that he did not intend to send. He told her about the woman in the ER with the coin and the way the boy had looked guilty and pleased at having swallowed money, as if he had been told his whole life that coins are powerful and had decided to test it. He told her about the conditional and how the kids ate it like candy, and how he wanted to learn the subjunctive not to be clever but to deserve wishes. He wrote about wanting correctly and he wrote, I will not ask you to make me a future, and then he crossed it out and then he drew an arrow to it to make sure he would see it later. He closed the notebook and let the underside of his wrist rest on the cool table until he could feel his pulse declaring itself a normal citizen.\n\nJill texted him a flyer with too many fonts for a reading and zine release at Mestizo and asked if he would read the poem he hadn\u2019t shown anyone. He wrote back, absolutely not, and then, because she knew how to aim, she sent a photograph of Mario holding a stapled booklet like a trophy and said, he is reading, and then he was ashamed of himself and said yes and then put his phone face down as if that would help. On the night of the reading the room felt like a general store for thoughts. People stood and bought coffee they didn\u2019t need and told each other about the weather as if they were going to fix it. He waited his turn and read in Spanish first, not because he was brave but because he needed the mercy of straining. His voice didn\u2019t shake because it had too much to do, and when he looked up he saw Mara near the door, hair down, arms crossed in a way that kept her from hugging herself. She smiled with her eyes like a person who has decided to be impressed on purpose. After, she told him the poem had a clean line and a necessary clumsiness. He said, thank you, and also, I didn\u2019t know you were coming, and she said, who do you think told Jill to ask you, and he laughed and felt a small heat behind his eyes and looked at the ceiling and counted the tiles like a man pretending he didn\u2019t know what to do with gratitude.\n\nThey walked outside and stood in the glow of a streetlight that remembered moths. She told him the gallery would be going to Los Angeles for a week and that between now and then everything would be performed twice, once for practice and once for money. She told him she had applied to a graduate program with an application that had asked her to write the same essay she had been writing in different rooms since she was nineteen and that she hated herself for wanting the yes and she hated herself for wanting to be the person who could say no to the yes. He told her that if she left, he would keep going to the center and he would keep listening in line at the market and he would keep reading aloud to a room full of children who would someday decide for themselves whether they wanted to be kind. She put her palm briefly against the center of his chest like a person checking if a machine was on. He did not reach for her hand. He stood still and gave her the steadiness she had requested months ago without knowing it. She said, quietly, you make a room where I can hear myself, and he said, then let that be the room, and she smiled in relief and a little grief and said, you are too good at this, and he said, not yet.\n\nAt his parents\u2019 house, his father\u2019s pill organizer now sat next to the salt the way a tool lives among condiments when it has been told it is part of the daily table. His mother had learned to let the kitchen be a gentle assembly line instead of an institution. After dinner she handed him a stack of plates and said, in Spanish without announcing it, t\u00fa lavas, yo seco, and he answered, est\u00e1 bien, and they did these simple things in another language and nobody made a moment out of it. Later, his father told him the story of when the refinery had blown a flame so high the boys had written their initials in soot on the sidewalk and thought they were making history, and Benjamin listened and asked, is there a part of the story you never tell, and his father looked toward the back door where the lawn waited and said, sometimes I leave out the parts where I was scared, and Benjamin said, you can put them back in, and his father nodded at the air like a man who might.\n\nThe gallery\u2019s Los Angeles week came on like weather. Mara sent him photographs of crates and freight elevators and the back-of-house rooms where the walls are beige and concrete and the art looks like it is waiting to be introduced to its mask. She wrote him a message from an airless convention space at midnight that said, my feet are filing a formal complaint, and he wrote back, voy a presentar una demanda en su nombre, and she wrote, no seas rid\u00edculo, and then, gracias, and he put his phone on the table next to the bowl of oranges and went to wash his face with water as cold as a decision. For seven days he did not see her and it was like learning a new breath. He did not text Jill to ask for news; he did not go online to look for photographs of people being the kind of people you can recognize from a distance. He read to the kids about a house that had grown tired of standing still and put wheels under itself, and when he mispronounced ladrillos, Mario said it with him out loud without making a scene.\n\nWhen Mara came back she looked like a person who had been admired long and asked to be useful in ways she did not yet have words for. They met at the library because neither of them trusted anywhere else. She spread her notebook on the table like a card game and said, future, conditional, subjunctive, all in the same hour, like showing him a hill and saying they would stroll it. He told her that he had already cheated on the subjunctive and she laughed and said, everyone does, like a bishop forgiving a harmless vice. She wrote, quiero que, dudo que, ojal\u00e1 que, and they played with the things you can say only when you admit you are not in charge. He said, quiero que te cuides, and she blinked once as if something had moved in the room, and then she said, yo tambi\u00e9n, quiero que te cuides, and they let that be a sentence without asking it to be a vow.\n\nHe invited her to dinner with his parents and she said not yet and then wrote, tell me about your mother\u2019s napkins again, and he drew them for her on a paper towel, the pattern she favored, the way she folded corners under to make the square exact. She invited him to a small thing, not a gala, a fundraiser in a church basement for a program that placed books in laundromats, and he said, yes, and discovered that in rooms like that people gave you money not because you had asked artfully but because your face was familiar. He wrote a check with his careful banker hand and did not apologize to his future for the subtraction. He watched a toddler sit on the floor and read a book upside down with the concentration of a surgeon and felt his throat go tight and then relax because sometimes gratitude arrives like a helpful stranger and sometimes it arrives like a cough you can\u2019t get rid of and either way it leaves you better.\n\nThe inversion came down in earnest in October and sat on their shoulders like a teacher with a grudge. After two days of chewing the air, everyone stopped being brave about it and started sounding like a chorus of bad clarinets. He swam at Steiner because the water felt rude in a way he needed. He read a bilingual book in the hot tub and a man next to him said, without malice, so you\u2019re the guy who\u2019s always studying, and he said, sometimes, and the man said, good, and then they both stared at the clock like they were taunting it. He drove to the lake one afternoon because he wanted to see if there was a horizon left, and there was, flatter, meaner, and beautiful as a rebuke.\n\nAt the center, Jill introduced a new volunteer, a woman with a braid down her back and the certainty of someone who had taught third grade in a town that did not get its fair share of streetlights. Benjamin stepped back to let her lead and then stepped forward to remind a boy he liked that he could say por favor without diminishing himself. David had put a bulletin board up with the kids\u2019 first lines, and the sentences, in both languages, made the far wall look like it had decided to become a mouth. Mario wrote, a veces quisiera ser una bicicleta, and then he crossed out quisiera and wrote quiero, and Benjamin didn\u2019t correct him. He stood and grinned at the board like an idiot and then pretended he had been invited to check the thermostat.\n\nNovember colored the foothills and then took the color away with the economy of a landlord. Mara\u2019s graduate program sent a letter that was not a letter, only instructions about calling a portal something else, and she looked at the screen and then at him and said, if they say no, I will be fine, and if they say yes, I will be problematic. He said, I will be here either way, and then tried to soften it with a joke about how his sink had improved its water pressure, but the sentence had already done what sentences do when they arrive in the world wanting to be true. She looked at him with affection and with worry, which is to say she looked at him like a person.\n\nHe drove to Bountiful for Thanksgiving with the pie he hadn\u2019t made and stood at the sink with his mother and learned a new fold, the one for the cloth that sits under the rolls, and she told him that the boy who had swallowed a coin had swallowed another and his mother had told him, you can\u2019t keep money that way, and he had laughed and not cried because he was seven. They watched football and pretended the men on the screen were heroes and then they watched his father sleep with his mouth open like a boy and decided not to say anything. In the evening he stood on the porch with his coat unbuttoned and the air did the kindness of not being ambitious, and he said to himself, in the language he had chosen, seguir\u00e9, and then, in the other one, I will keep doing this until I am done.\n\nWhen snow finally came it did not ask for permission. It took the city\u2019s edges and made them honest. The lake took the snow into its mouth and changed nothing about itself, which felt like a lesson he didn\u2019t yet understand. He met Mara at the library with their cheeks reddened and their ears complaining and she said, subjunctive again, because winter demands grammar. They wrote down sentences about wishing and fearing and hoping and doubting, the four corners you pin a life to when you cannot be certain, and she said, I hope you don\u2019t make yourself small for anyone, and he said, I doubt I could if I tried, and then he added, but I worried once that I would, and then he corrected it to the past perfect to prove he could. She laughed and said, I regret teaching you to make elegance out of sadness, and he said, we would have found it anyway.\n\nOn a night so cold it made cellophane of the sky, he walked past the gallery and saw through the glass at an angle that made the inside look like a place it had never been. Mara stood by the counter with Tom\u00e1s and another woman, and she was animated in a way that could have been joy and could have been strategy and was probably both. He stood outside long enough to be uncomfortable and then left before discomfort could shape his mouth into something untrue. At home he wrote a list of things he wanted with grammar that felt honest. Quiero leer bien. Quiero ayudar sin pedir aplausos. Quiero amar sin pedir recibo. He looked at the list and didn\u2019t ask it to be otherwise.\n\nWhen Jill texted to ask if he could cover reading on a day snow had made cowardly, he said yes without making it sound like a favor. The kids straggled in like birds who had discovered winter is not a rumor. He read them a story about a woman who didn\u2019t know what to do with a gift and decided to keep it unwrapped until it told her, and the kids shifted like they were deciding whether to trust him. At the end, Mario raised his hand and said, in Spanish, that sometimes not opening something is the bravest way to keep it, and Benjamin looked at him with something sharper than pride and said, in the same language, that sometimes you open it and find a smaller box inside and that is a joke you can decide to like. They laughed together as if the joke were sufficient.\n\nHe walked home in snow that fizzed and thought about the coming year\u2019s verbs. The future, still arrogant. The conditional, still tender. The subjunctive, an acre he had bought with sweat and was learning to plant. He thought of Mara and did not rehearse a confession. He thought of his parents and did not rehearse a defense. He thought of the lake, petty and sublime, and did not rehearse forgiveness. In his apartment he peeled an orange whose skin resisted and decided resistance is one way love recognizes itself. He ate over the sink and said ojal\u00e1 out loud, and then he laughed at himself for liking the sound of his own hope, and he did it again anyway, because if language has taught him anything, it is that you are allowed to repeat what saves you.",

The first storm came overnight with the serious quiet of a man doing arithmetic and in the morning the world had been cut into simpler shapes. Snow made good neighbors of roofs and made every car into a declaration of character\u2014brushed clean with pride or left sullen under a crust. The inversion rode in on the storm\u2019s coat tails and stayed, the sky going from confession to erasure in an afternoon. From his office, the Wasatch returned only as rumor. He could feel the air sitting on his chest like an uncle who had always meant well and never learned when to stand.\n\nAt the laundromat on 600 North, the air was warm and damp and smelled like pennies and laundry soap that had not been measured with precision. A folding table had been repurposed into a bookshelf and then into an altar of sorts. Someone had taped paper stars to a wall in a way that made them look like they were trying to climb without drawing attention. A hand-lettered sign read Libros gratis/Free Books in a script that had practiced being friendly. Jill had scrounged a string of lights and draped them above the machines and now they buzzed like they had opinions. He stood awkwardly with a tote full of picture books and a bag of clementines because oranges were too big for small hands that also had to hold quarters.\n\nThey were doing a posada, Jill had said, without ceremony. Not a reenactment so much as a translation. Las Posadas in a laundromat meant children with paper lanterns taped to fiberglass rods and songs sung on key and off down aisles of tumbling towels and a woman at machine four crying a little into the shoulder of her coat because the words had surprised her. He knew the English carols of his childhood down to the muscle memory of the way his throat tightened on certain chords, and now he held a thin stapled booklet and tried to find his way into pide posada with a mouth that wanted\u2014more and more these days\u2014the permission grammar gave him. Jill looked at him from across the room as if to say, this is both more and less complicated than we think.\n\nThe first door was a dryer with a sign that said NO VENT THIS ONE, and the boy who had once retired from racing rabbits knocked anyway with the seriousness of a man at a threshold. The verses passed back and forth, the inside voices saying there is no room and the children\u2019s small chorus insisting until a final verse opened the door, and the mothers laughed and wiped their eyes and somebody\u2019s aunt hummed a harmony that made strangers look at one another as if they had been introduced. He sang the part that asked and felt the asking settle into him. D\u00e9me posada felt like admitting you would be hungry later; \u00e1branos, like telling the truth about your fear of being outside. A little girl with a paper crown asked if he was the posadero or the peregrino and he said, \u201cA veces, los dos,\u201d and she nodded like this was obvious, then turned to tell a baby in a car seat a secret with a solemnity that made him want to own a lemon tree just so he could hand her fruit.\n\nAfterward, while children compared stickers as if they had been paid in stamps for bravery, a woman with hair tied back in a scarf the color of persimmons asked him in Spanish if he worked at the bank on Main. When he said he did, she told him her rent had gone up again and her landlord had replaced the mailbox locks with a smile that had not been friendly. He felt the part of him that measured risk and the part of him that counted apples collide. \u201cHay programas,\u201d he said carefully, aware of the way programs can disgust themselves with their own names, \u201cy puedo preguntar,\u201d and she looked at him with both hope and the exact amount of skepticism hope should come with these days, and said, \u201cPregunte. Y regrese.\u201d He said he would, and for once he did not feel like a man making a promise just to hear himself sound good.\n\nMara texted a photograph of a page with the imperative commands circled in three colors, the circles messy in a way that told him she had been thinking with a pen and not with a plan. ven, dime, qu\u00e9date sat there like words that were either a game or a dare. The caption read, \u201cMandatos. Dangerous. Useful.\u201d He wrote back, \u201cNo me des \u00f3rdenes,\u201d and she sent a row of clapping hands and then, \u201cS\u00e9 valiente.\u201d He wrote, \u201cEstoy practicando,\u201d and felt, again, the ease of saying something as a verb and not a vow.\n\nThey met at the library with their cheeks red from the walk and their hands cold in the way that makes hot coffee seem medicinal rather than decadent. She spread a notebook and wrote two columns: t\u00fa and usted, and he groaned like a door that needed oil. \u201cThis is where you practice affection and respect without confusing them,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere do you use formal? Where do you use you-you?\u201d He said at work he wanted you all to be formal until he heard someone call the receptionist \u201cmija\u201d and understood he had entered a family meeting. She said, \u201cTell me to sit,\u201d and he said, \u201cSi\u00e9ntate, por favor,\u201d and she sat with exaggerated obedience and then told him to stand\u2014p\u00e1rate\u2014and he stood and then stayed standing because suddenly standing felt like his job.\n\nThey made themselves laugh with \u201cponte el su\u00e9ter\u201d and \u201cno comas eso\u201d and she told him how her grandmother had turned the imperative into a love language and how sometimes the only way to say I see you and I want you to stay is to hand someone a coat and say, \u201cP\u00f3ntelo.\u201d He turned that over in his mouth and tasted his mother of late saying \u201cpon una olla, mijito,\u201d as if inviting him to cook were a way of inviting him to remain a son. He wrote down \u201ccu\u00eddate\u201d and circled it and she noticed and pretended not to, then noticed that she was pretending and rolled her eyes at herself.\n\nThe bank\u2019s year-end required a particular theater. There were cookies at reception with the company colors in frosting and a memo that said Thank You in a tone that could not help sounding managerial. His boss called him into a conference room that always felt like a waiting room in a nice hospital and told him that there was a vice president title in January if he wanted to carry that particular weight. It came with a raise that would be meaningful to any budget that had a margin and with more meetings where the word risk would be asked to wear a tie. He said he would think about it and meant it, not as a performance of humility but as a man who had learned that adding letters to your business card can sometimes subtract something else. In the elevator afterward, a coworker congratulated him as if the decision had already decided itself, and Benjamin heard himself say \u201cgracias\u201d and then, because he had started showing up to rooms in two languages, he said \u201cthank you,\u201d and the coworker looked at him curious, then bored, then said something about skiing and got off on two.\n\nHe went home to an apartment that smelled like damp wool and made a pot of beans with more devotion than skill, adding bay leaves as if they were the difference between nourished and merely fed. He peeled a clementine and placed the peels on the edge of the counter in a spiral because sometimes arranging the world into shapes was the only kind of control anybody deserved. He wrote a list of debts, not financial; the people he owed oranges to, the rooms that had given him a place to be a beginner, the voices that had corrected him without humiliating him. He wrote Jill\u2019s name and David\u2019s and Mario\u2019s and his mother\u2019s and, after a long pause, Mara\u2019s, and then he said out loud like a prayer without being one, \u201cP\u00e1guenme con paciencia,\u201d and laughed at himself for making even love an accounting problem, and then didn\u2019t take it back.\n\nThe next storm got stuck over the valley like a decision you refuse to make because making it will cost you something. The city gathered snow in the corners of its mouth, then smiled and dropped it in clotted piles. He walked to Rancho with a scarf his mother had knitted when he was twenty-one and certain he would not need a scarf for a life lived indoors. The bakery case had conchas that looked like the idea of winter had sat down and stopped trying to be elegant. He bought a bag of pan dulce and two pounds of oranges because oranges were still his offering, and on the way home he saw a man on a ladder at a storefront on State, hanging a wooden sign that said Zapater\u00eda, and he thought about all the ways people tell you where to knock.\n\nMara\u2019s cough came through in a voice note like a person arguing with a door that won\u2019t open. \u201cEstoy enferma,\u201d she said, and then translated, as was their habit, \u201cI am sick,\u201d and then corrected herself, \u201cTengo una gripe. It has me,\u201d and he said, \u201cVoy,\u201d before asking himself whether he had been given permission to use the imperative on his own heart. He went anyway, with a grocery bag that made him feel more like a man playing a role than a hero. Her building\u2019s hallway smelled like last week\u2019s deliveries and the radiator that had decided to be a river. She opened the door in socks and a sweater that had learned to droop where it mattered. Her hair was half of something and her eyes were the kind of bright you don\u2019t ask compliments from.\n\n\u201cI brought food you will not like,\u201d he said at the threshold, because humor was their best boundary. \u201cAnd tea that will be wrong. And a magazine with pictures of houses you will mock.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will mock them kindly,\u201d she said, then turned and coughed in a way that made his chest answer. \u201cEntra,\u201d she said, and the word felt as old as all the doors he had wanted to be let through.\n\nHe made a caldo that was both soup and apology, standing in a kitchen where the knives were honest and the sink remembered other men. He cut carrots into quarters because halves felt like cheating and added a whole onion because Sor Juana had taught him to respect certain spirits. She lay on the couch under a blanket too thin to be proud and watched him the way people watch a movie they always suspected they would like. \u201cNo me mandes,\u201d she said when he handed her tea and he said, \u201cT\u00f3mate esto,\u201d and she made a face and drank and did not forgive him. He sat at the far end of the couch like a guest with good intentions and bad sense.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be here,\u201d she said finally, gently, with the outline of a smile. \u201cThat is to say, thank you. And don\u2019t get sick. And don\u2019t be the kind of man who thinks soup is a romance plot.\u201d He raised his hands like a thief caught without loot. \u201cMe quedo en la cocina,\u201d he said. \u201cSoy \u00fatil y mudo.\u201d She laughed, then said, \u201cNadie es mudo,\u201d and he nodded because she was right, and because he wanted to be the kind of man who knew when wanting to be necessary was not the same as being necessary.\n\nHe left before midnight and shoveled her steps because the snow had made itself a moral, and tucked a note under the salt by her door that said, in his careful script, \u201cEstoy al lado si necesitas una medicina o palabras o silencio,\u201d and drew a small orange that looked like a planet with a stem. In the morning she sent a photo of the drawing with a laugh-cry emoji and the command, \u201cDuerme,\u201d and he did for once, like a person for whom sleep is not an adversary.\n\nHis father\u2019s breath had settled back into its routine as if it had never considered striking, and yet Benjamin found himself rehearsing phone calls in his head. He went up to Bountiful with salt for the steps and batteries for the radio that nobody used anymore and stood in the driveway with his father as they applied practical knowledge to snow. There is a way men lean on their shovels that is not posing but does not entirely avoid it. \u201cWe should hire someone,\u201d his father said after a minute, and Benjamin said, \u201cI\u2019ll come,\u201d and his father said, \u201cYou can\u2019t always,\u201d and Benjamin said, \u201cI know,\u201d and they stood inside that fact together without trying to make it smaller. Inside, his mother taught him another fold, the napkin for holidays, the one shaped like a little mountain that sits up on the plate as if to say ceremony is not evil.\n\nAt work he brought the rent increase to a colleague whose job was labeled with a word that had the right vowels and not enough teeth. \u201cWe have a small fund,\u201d she said, tucking hair behind her ear as if an idea might fall out. \u201cTiny. Less than a sports car. We can do a one-time assistance if they meet three criteria and the moon does a trick.\u201d He took the form without hating it because hating forms had never filled a pantry. He sat with the woman at the laundromat later that week, watched her read the list, watched her not ask whether the assistance was taking a picture of her or making a door. \u201cRegrese,\u201d she said softly to him when they were done, as much an invitation as an instruction. He thought about the road between a bank and a life and how thin it often is.\n\nMestizo hosted a reading where the room smelled like coffee and wet wool and good nerves. Mario stood at the microphone on a stool taller than his sense of danger and read a story about a bicycle that refused to carry anyone who called it \u201cmy\u201d anything. The room applauded because it was both charming and ruthless. Caleb came late and sat on the floor and read a poem that moved like a man late for a bus and only at the end admitted it was about his mother. Benjamin stood in back and found himself wanting to touch shoulders of strangers when certain lines landed, an instinct he honored by keeping his hands in his pockets. When Mara came she stood near him without taking his arm and said, \u201cYou look good among people,\u201d and he said, \u201cI am trying to be one,\u201d and she said, \u201cIt shows,\u201d which is the kind of sentence somebody saves for when they want to be fair.\n\nShe told him after, outside, breath visible and inconvenient, that she had heard from one school and they had said yes. She said it like a weather report she wanted to be wrong about and craved at the same time. The yes glowed between them for a second, an object neither of them quite knew how to pick up safely. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said, and meant it in the way a person means a thing that will cost them. \u201cWhat will you do,\u201d he asked like a student trying out a construction, and she said, \u201cNo s\u00e9,\u201d and then corrected herself the way she taught him to, \u201cEstoy pensando,\u201d and tucked her hands into her sleeves like a girl trying to make this winter pass with fewer scrapes.\n\nHe walked home with the yes in his pocket like a coin he was afraid he\u2019d spend by accident. He made a note to himself in his careful ledger of the heart: do not make the yes about you. He wrote it twice and circled it. The next morning he went to the gallery and stood in front of a small painting of a kitchen in winter and tried to see what she saw when she hung it as if she were telling a person where to stand. Tom\u00e1s floated by and said the acceptance would look good on the website and Benjamin said, because he couldn\u2019t keep himself from it, \u201cIt will look good in her life,\u201d and Tom\u00e1s said, \u201cThat, too,\u201d as if those two things sometimes take turns.\n\nOn a Sunday he went with his parents to a bilingual sacrament meeting because his mother had heard the music was lively and because his father\u2019s doctor had said church was good for a heart if you knew how to sit. He took the bread in his hand and passed it and felt how his mouth had learned to make the words that went with the ritual even when he didn\u2019t say them out loud. After, a man he recognized from the laundromat nodded at him with the dignity of a neighbor in a new room. His mother asked on the way out if he could teach her how to say \u201cIt is cold\u201d the way her friend\u2019s granddaughter said it, and he said, \u201cHace fr\u00edo,\u201d and she said it twice and then said, \u201cTengo,\u201d and he said, \u201cYou can have it too,\u201d and she looked at him like he had given her a new towel for a job she was still doing.\n\nSnow made its old rituals and the city obliged by moving more slowly. He sat at his desk at the bank and looked at the vice president title on an email and said to himself, in Spanish because it kept him honest, \u201cNo te agrandes si no te cabe,\u201d and grinned because he had taught himself to joke in a language that had taken effort. He checked the box marked yes to the title because saying no would have been a performance today, and then he wrote his own list of imperatives on a sticky note and put it on the edge of his monitor where he could not avoid the shape of his promises. S\u00e9 amable. No te inventes h\u00e9roes. Aprende despacio. Pregunta m\u00e1s. No des discursos que nadie te pidi\u00f3. Aplaude a otros. Lleva naranjas. The last one made him laugh, then sober up, because he had seen how oranges turned into something else when handed at the right door.\n\nHe took Mara to see the lake in winter because he wanted her to have that horizon before she decided which one she would live with next. The causeway had become a necessary straight line under a sky that had decided to be glass. The brine had stitched a lace of ice along the edge where the water argued with itself. The gulls made a sound that was like laughter and warning at once. They walked carefully, shoes finding the places their bodies trusted. She wrapped her scarf higher and he did not offer his arm because there is a way you can over-announce your intentions and ruin the very good you meant. \u201cI might go,\u201d she said, looking at a line that had never cared for human verbs. \u201cI might not. If I stay, I don\u2019t want it to be because I was afraid. If I go, I don\u2019t want it to be because I wanted to be above anyone.\u201d He nodded at the lake like it could take dictation. \u201cTe sigo,\u201d he said, then corrected himself because this was not that, \u201cTe apoyo.\u201d She turned and considered him the way people look at a place to check if it has become familiar. \u201cAp\u00f3yate, too,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that one.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t kiss her. The sentence had stopped feeling like a test and started feeling like a practice. Her shoulder touched his sleeve and then left and neither of them made that human mistake of narrating every contact like an omen. On the drive back, they counted the number of people who had decided to try the ice and then made bets about which ones would turn back, and she was right more often and he forgave her for being right nothing at all needed forgiving. He dropped her at the gallery and she pointed at his chest like a doctor checking a pulse and said, \u201cCu\u00eddate,\u201d and he said, \u201cT\u00fa tambi\u00e9n,\u201d and they both heard the imperative as a handshake and not a leash.\n\nAt the center, the kids returned in boots and complaints and puddles. Jill made a chart about verbs of weather for fun and was delighted when no one else thought this was fun. Benjamin wrote \u201cnevar\u201d across the top like a prophecy. They read a book about an umbrella that did not belong to anyone and therefore belonged to everyone and Mario declared that he was now in favor of public libraries for umbrellas, and Jill clapped like a seal at a new trick because she has always loved the small sentences that are really a country. After, a volunteer he didn\u2019t know well asked him if he ever said prayers anymore and he said, \u201cA veces,\u201d and then, because this had become his habit, he translated for himself, \u201cSometimes,\u201d and didn\u2019t hate the version of himself who could live in sometimes.\n\nOn a night in late December he stood with his parents on a driveway holding cups of something both hot and bland while neighbors set off fireworks because the year had decided it wanted applause on its way out. His father, unsolicited, put a hand on his shoulder and left it there for a count that mattered. His mother leaned against the doorframe and watched the sky do its noisy small-time imitation of God and said, in Spanish without making a fuss, \u201cTen cuidado,\u201d and he said, \u201cSiempre,\u201d and then, because he was trying to be precise and not dramatic, he added, \u201cLo intento.\u201d In his apartment later he wrote his resolutions as if they were commands a gentle commander could give. S\u00e9 exacto con tu ternura. No traduzcas a la gente para tu poema si no te dieron permiso. No prometas lo que no es tuyo. Habla m\u00e1s despacio. No digas que no sabes si s\u00ed sabes. Di no cuando toca. Pide posada cuando est\u00e1s afuera. He set the paper down and put a clementine on top of it like a paperweight from another country.\n\nNew Year\u2019s Day was the kind of morning Salt Lake sometimes gives you as a dare: brittle and blue and so clear you felt you could read your own thoughts if you stood still and didn\u2019t cloud them by speaking. He went to the pool and swam in water that was a scolding and a kindness, counted laps in Spanish because one, two, three had started to feel like a life he kept around for when he wanted to be who he had been. Tres, cuatro, cinco, he said under his breath, and understood how mouths learn to make a life because they get tired of not. In the hot tub afterward, a man told a story in a slow drawl about a truck that wouldn\u2019t start and then the man said the other man had prayed on the hood and the truck started and Benjamin said, \u201cQu\u00e9 bueno,\u201d before he remembered this wasn\u2019t one of the rooms where he had earned the right to speak in Spanish, and the man didn\u2019t blink, just grinned and said, \u201cYeah,\u201d and for a second all the rooms felt like one.\n\nA week later the vice president title sat on his email and did not make a sound, and he accepted it with the practical sense that sometimes the way to hold your shape in a system is to take a chair at the table and keep your accent. He went to the laundromat and told the woman with the persimmon scarf that the fund could pay a part of one month and help with the old past-due if she didn\u2019t mind three signatures and a photograph of her mailbox, and she breathed out through her nose as if she had been holding her breath through a small tunnel and said, \u201cBueno,\u201d and he said, \u201cNo es suficiente,\u201d and she said, \u201cPara hoy, s\u00ed,\u201d and then handed him a Tupperware of cookies and told him not to be dramatic.\n\nThe acceptance from the second school came in an envelope that did not have the decency to look heavy. Mara slid it onto the table between them at the library like a card in a game he was not playing. \u201cAbre,\u201d she said, and he said, \u201cNo,\u201d and she said, \u201c\u00c1brelo,\u201d imperative corrected, and he laughed and opened, and the words said yes in a different accent. She sat back and let the quiet be the first to speak. \u201cI need to think,\u201d she said, like a person who had done too much of it in too many rooms and still respected the work. He said, \u201cI\u2019m proud,\u201d and meant it and did not ask what the pride would cost him. She wrote The Subjunctive across their page like a title and under it, \u201cEspero que,\u201d and did not finish the sentence. He drew a small orange in the margin and she saw it and shook her head like a person refusing a gift and also keeping it.\n\nThey walked out into air that had learned humility and stood by the rail looking down at the plaza where a boy threw himself at a skateboard and caught himself again, the human body\u2019s argument with gravity practiced and resolved and still interesting. \u201cBe careful,\u201d she said, without the joke this time. \u201cWith me, with this, with your ideas about saving things that didn\u2019t ask.\u201d He nodded at the boy and felt the tug toward performance like a tide he could now name. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he said instead, as a simple present, not as an oath. She touched the back of his hand with the side of her finger, a contact so modest it could have been an accident if they were strangers. He did not move. \u201cBien,\u201d she said, and then looked at the sky like someone checking if weather had decided anything new.\n\nWhen the storm that was supposed to miss the city hit anyway, he stood on his porch and watched the street learn silence the way a class learns a new substitute. Snow took back roadlines and made people walk in ways that remembered childhood. A neighbor knocked on his door and asked for a shovel and he handed it over and then ten minutes later went outside to help without making a scene of it. He said to himself as they worked, \u201cSe me cay\u00f3 el miedo un poco,\u201d liking the way the accident pronoun allowed him to admit his hands had dropped something. He liked even more that he could say it without having to build a theory. Across the street, a couple he had watched fight quietly now carried groceries together, laughing in a way that made him wonder if the argument had been a way to get to this moment and not a detour.\n\nHe read to the kids a story about a woman who made a city out of snow and then watched it melt and he asked them, in Spanish, what the imperative would be if you wanted to ask snow to stay. They yelled, \u201c\u00a1Qu\u00e9date!\u201d with the reckless faith of children who have not yet learned weather\u2019s true perspective. He taught them the polite version, \u201cqu\u00e9dese,\u201d and they booed and then laughed because the sound of booing itself is funny if you let it be. Mario, newly opinionated, raised his hand and said, \u201cWe should not tell the snow what to do,\u201d and Benjamin wanted to kiss the top of the boy\u2019s head like an uncle who had misbehaved. \u201cCorrecto,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can want. We cannot boss clouds.\u201d\n\nHe texted Mara before bed with a sentence that had taken him half an hour to make simple. \u201cNo te pido nada hoy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cS\u00f3lo te digo que estoy aqu\u00ed.\u201d He flipped the phone over and turned off the light and lay with the sentence like a small animal warming itself at his throat. In the morning, an answer: \u201cGracias. Hoy, eso es suficiente.\u201d He said the word enough in both languages as he brushed his teeth and liked that it felt sharp and useful in both. The mountains appeared again for a day and then folded themselves back into fog. He packed oranges into his bag and a copy of Sor Juana and the list of imperatives he would revise for the rest of his winter. He put his hand on the knob, paused at the door, and told himself in a voice that sounded a little like Mara\u2019s grandmother and a little like his mother and not at all like Tom\u00e1s, \u201cAnda,\u201d and he did.",

The inversion returned after every storm the way a bad habit returns after every resolution, and the mountains retreated again into the vocabulary of rumor. Benjamin wore the vice president title like a jacket he hadn\u2019t tailored yet. He had accepted it because saying no would have been a performance he didn\u2019t trust, and because there were rooms he wanted to enter without pretending to be the caterer. He found that a second nameplate on his door did not change the way his morning coffee tasted, but it did change the conversations that arrived at his desk. Men with plans came and sat without tipping their hats, and women with spreadsheets brought him edges that could cut both ways. Between emails he folded the corner of Sor Juana\u2019s page and underlined a verb and told himself not to mistake the feeling of underlining for the act of understanding.\n\nMara disappeared for forty-eight hours that first week into a visit to one of the schools that had said yes. She texted from an airport where the outlets did not keep their promises and from a train that apologized in two languages when it was late. She sent a photograph of a campus tree older than anybody in her family and a caption that said, tell me I don\u2019t owe anything to this kind of beauty, and he wrote back nothing persuasive, only, I trust you to count correctly. He watered her plants while she was gone and read the labels she had written on painter\u2019s tape for the pots\u2014ponle poquita, no seas exagerado; dale un beso de agua\u2014and he obeyed the imperatives as if disobedience would curse the whole apartment. He left an orange on her table like a coin you pay to a ferryman whether or not you\u2019re crossing.\n\nThe center ran on January like a generator, steady sound and a little heat. The kids came with red ears and boots that left puddles which David called honest footprints. Jill hung new flyers that made demands sound like invitations, and a woman from the health department set up a table with pamphlets about asthma that looked designed by a committee that hated children but loved fonts. Benjamin read about a cat who insisted on living on a roof and a boy who insisted on living on the ground, and the two of them arranged a friendship that did not ask either one to pretend the laws of physics were negotiable. Mario, hair cut again by someone with opinions, raised his hand and asked if cats could learn the conditional, and Benjamin said, only when they want, and Jill laughed because the sentence had the shape of a truth even if it was a lie.\n\nOn a Thursday afternoon when the bank\u2019s air tasted like copier toner and peppermint, a file landed on his desk with the weight of a decision disguised as a discussion. An out-of-state firm wanted to buy a strip of warehouses near the tracks and turn them into studios and cafes and three \u201cmicro-units\u201d per building that would be very macro to the rent rolls of his city. The pro forma was cheerful. The list of tenants who would have to move was a footnote with numbers where there should have been names. The credit would earn the bank a bonus laugh in the right room. He took the file to the conference room with the good projector and the bad lighting and stood there alone for a minute, the way a man stands in a chapel when he is deciding which sin he\u2019s going to commit and which he\u2019s going to postpone. He wrote on a notepad in his careful hand: covenants, notices, bilingual signage, relocation support, breathing room. He wrote on the next line: what is mine to ask.\n\nWhen he brought his list to the committee, the room arranged itself into its usual story. A senior officer with a tie the color of a warning light cleared his throat and said this is not a charity, and a younger colleague who kept fresh fruit at her desk said neither is it a machine that stamps people out. His boss gave him the look that meant speak but do not sermonize, and he spoke, and did not. He asked for conditions that cost money and saved face, for notices sent in Spanish and English with days that counted like days and not like theater, for a small fund to help tenants move without having to find trucks and cousins. The senior officer asked, practical, how much this charity would cost the bank, and Benjamin said a number that made nobody happy and therefore, he suspected, was in the neighborhood of right. The committee sighed like men at a wedding during the part where we are assured it is not a bed of roses. In the hall, his boss said that if he kept this up he would eventually be famous for the wrong reasons, and then said, not unkindly, good work, keep the number under control.\n\nHe called Jill that night because he had learned to submit his good intentions to a person who would not stroke them only in the pleasing direction. He told her the terms he\u2019d asked for and the thread he\u2019d pulled, and she listened, then said that moving a needle isn\u2019t the same as moving a house, and also that sometimes it is the only thing you get to do. She told him a family from the center had received a notice with language that said \u201cno cause\u201d in a font that didn\u2019t even pretend to be sorry. He asked the address and it was one of the numbers on the list of warehouses, and he felt his stomach perform a small, neat betrayal. \u201cI\u2019ll call,\u201d he said, and she said, \u201cDon\u2019t promise outcomes, promise presence,\u201d and he wrote that on a sticky note and put it on the wall where he couldn\u2019t avoid it when he wanted to.\n\nThe lesson that week was periphrasis, the grammar gimmicks that are actually the architecture of a life. Mara returned from her trip with a new winter on her coat and wrote on their paper: ir a + infinitive, acabar de + infinitive, volver a + infinitive, seguir + gerundio, llevar + gerundio. She said, this is how you tell people that time is not just a thing that happens to you; it\u2019s a thing you stand inside and name. He said, voy a llamar, and meant the landlord and the developer and his boss; he said, acabo de enterarme, and meant the way info arrives as if it owes you an apology; he said, vuelvo a intentar, and felt the relief of allowing himself loops. She circled seguir and wrote, you\u2019re good at this one, and he laughed because it sounded like a report card and also because it was true. \u201cLlevo tres meses yendo al centro,\u201d he tried, and she nodded like a woman blessing a baby and said, \u201cMuy bien,\u201d and then corrected his article to make the sentence less proud of itself.\n\nThey practiced the accidental se because she insisted there was not a better way to talk about responsibility in America. \u201cSe me olvid\u00f3,\u201d she said, tapping her head, explaining the protective vagueness. \u201cThe forgetting happened to me. The breaking happened to me. Nobody broke it, the world just fell.\u201d He said, \u201cSe me cay\u00f3 la paciencia,\u201d and laughed, then folded the sentence into his pocket like cash for an emergency. She told him that impersonal se might also keep him humble when he wanted to sound like a hero. \u201cSe nombr\u00f3 un comit\u00e9,\u201d she said dryly about his bank, and he responded, \u201cSe pintaron unos murales,\u201d about the warehouses he didn\u2019t want to see turned into brunch, and for a blessed minute neither of them pretended sentences were an adequate battlement against money.\n\nA small crisis came with a receipt and a date stamp. The mother with the scarf the color of persimmons arrived at the laundromat with a notice that said three days and a list of phone numbers that rang to machines. Benjamin stood with her under the relentlessness of fluorescent light and called a lawyer whose voicemail was as kind as a person can make a voicemail, and then he called a number he had written down at the bank and a man with a voice that had learned to hold all outcomes said he would look, and then he called his boss because that is what you do when your title has had letters added and doors behave differently. His boss said, careful, and then said, send me the parcel numbers, and Benjamin did, typing with more accuracy than he needed to, because accuracy is sometimes the only respect you have to offer.\n\nHe went to see the warehouses because thinking in the room has always been different than thinking in the email. The buildings were tired in noble ways. A painter had taped a sign to a door that said, don\u2019t knock between one and four unless you have an emergency or tacos, and Benjamin stood in the alley where he could see two lives at once\u2014the one where this stayed and the one where it changed\u2014and tried to name what he could live with. Tom\u00e1s appeared, because the city is smaller than anyone admits, with his collar turned up and a cigarette that he did not light out of politeness to a future exhibition. \u201cYou\u2019re meddling?\u201d he said without hostility, and Benjamin said, \u201cI\u2019m employed,\u201d and Tom\u00e1s said, \u201cIt is a thin line,\u201d and then they talked about a sculptor who was good and broke and whether those two adjectives always travel together.\n\nIt snowed on a Sunday in a way that made everyone forgive everyone else. The bilingual sacrament meeting was poorly attended because snow gives the righteous new excuses, and Benjamin sat near the back with his father and mother, who complained quietly about the draft like critics at a performance they had already decided to love. The opening hymn was one he knew in both languages and he worked the words in his mind like gum. After, he watched a woman he didn\u2019t know gather three children into their coats so efficiently he wanted to applaud. His mother said, sotto voce, in Spanish, that the bread tasted like it had been frozen and thawed, and his father said, in English, that he could live with that, and Benjamin felt that the marriage of his languages might be the only wedding he would not have to stand up to or away from this year.\n\nMestizo\u2019s Monday writing group started up again in a fit of optimism that felt like a vaccine. Caleb ran it like a circus usher, telling people where to sit and when to be brave. Benjamin came with a notebook and nothing he wanted to read and left with a line he couldn\u2019t stop saying under his breath: if you can\u2019t say I love you, say I am here and make that sentence heavy. Caleb smoked afterward and told him he should write about banking with the same shamelessness that men write about bodies, and Benjamin said, I\u2019m trying not to make easy metaphors, and Caleb said, there are no easy ones, there are only tired ones, and then he flicked ash into a snowbank that accepted everything without commentary.\n\nHe ran into Tom\u00e1s again at a coffee shop that had decided to lean into its plants. Tom\u00e1s had a magazine folded to a profile that used the word visionary three times and meant it each time less. He asked Benjamin with the grace of a man who knows how to make any question sound like small talk, what he would do if Mara left in August, and Benjamin said a sentence that had gotten him in and out of trouble all winter: seguir\u00e9. Tom\u00e1s smiled in the way men do when they recognize that a word is both an answer and a refusal, then said, she is practicing leaving, which is also a craft, and Benjamin said, she is practicing being a person who chooses, which is the same craft with better curtains.\n\nWhen Mara talked about the visit she had just made, they sat at the library away from the window because the view tempted both of them to narrate. She told him about a professor with a forehead like a fugue and a small kitchen with a window that made even a bad cup of coffee taste like a decision. She told him about walking into a room where everyone knew how to assume they belonged and the relief of discovering she could pretend this too, and the fatigue that arrives after an hour of pretending, and the small guilt of liking it. He told her about the committee and the covenants and the way he had become the man who asks for bilingual notices as if he were begging for candy, and she said, you are good at asking for small dignities and making them sound like gravity. He did not tell her he\u2019d asked his mother to teach him the napkin fold for holidays because it had begun to feel like a spell you can cast when decisions are far away.\n\nThe imperatives returned as weather. She began writing them on scrap paper and leaving them in his book as if she were trying to seed his winter. Come back. Check your verbs. Don\u2019t apologize to what you want. Eat. Don\u2019t play to the room. His favorite, which he wouldn\u2019t tell her because it would make her too powerful, was a small command that he taped to his wall above the bowl of oranges: Respira. He made a matching note for her when he left water on her windowsill with the small ferns that pretended to be tropical in a one-bedroom near a train: Duerme. When she thanked him for the plants he used the formal to make it a joke, \u201cDu\u00e9rmase,\u201d and she said, this is how love gets corny, and then said, I didn\u2019t say love, and he said, I didn\u2019t either, and they both left the sentence unpunished.\n\nA boy at the center brought a letter for his mother with a line in English that read \u201cwe regret to inform you,\u201d and Benjamin found himself translating regret to fact without the English apology that leans, with too much confidence, on the idea that naming a feeling changes the outcome. He explained slowly, in Spanish, the nonsense of thirty days, ninety days, a date by which action must be taken. The boy watched him as if he were showing him how to fix a bike chain, and Jill watched both of them as if she could make patience a force field. After, she pulled him into the little office that smelled like crayons and resolve and told him he was getting good at certain soft violences and should watch himself. He looked at her, not wounded. He knew what she meant. He said, tell me when I get it wrong. She said, I will, and I will not be gentle.\n\nHe dreamed in the pluperfect and woke up laughing. In the dream, he had loved correctly before he knew he knew how. He had had said it and then put it away like a dish. The Spanish let him treat time like dough. Hab\u00eda querido, hab\u00eda dicho, hab\u00eda sido. He lay there, mouth dry, heart not performing for anybody, and he felt the relief of tense allowing him to hold a feeling without having to risk the room. In the morning he made bad coffee and texted Mara a small piece of his dream, softened to not be a threat, and she answered with a string of verbs that read like a spell: hayas comido, hayas dormido, hayas sido cruel con tu correo electr\u00f3nico. He blessed her for making him laugh at eight in the morning in a month that had forgotten laughter without heat.\n\nThe developer with the haircut like a promise came back to the bank and sat in his office with a face that had perfected amiable and said the covenants were fine and he could make the numbers perform through other tricks, and also that if Benjamin wanted to attend the community meeting he was welcome, which is a kind of taunt that pretends to be a kind of courtesy. Benjamin said he would, because he had decided not to keep daring himself only in his head. The meeting was held in a room that had been a classroom in 1978 and never recovered from it. People came from both sides of the word change. A man with a bicycle helmet argued with a woman with three children and there was no sarcasm in either. The developer said the right sentences, including the ones about jobs and art, and Jill said the right sentences, including the ones about geography and survival, and Benjamin stood up and said the sentence he had rehearsed in a whisper\u2014this loan will go through my desk and it will have conditions and they will be enforced\u2014and what surprised him was how ordinary that sounded when it arrived in the air.\n\nOn a night when the lake was being punished by cold, he drove out alone because sometimes he wanted to see a horizon that did not require cooperation. The ice at the edge made lace again, then cracked, reminding him that not everything pretty is kind. He said sentences out loud in the conditional because winter allowed that kind of play without embarrassment. Dir\u00eda. Har\u00eda. Ser\u00eda. He tried on the future again without making it walk on a catwalk. Ir\u00e9. Estar\u00e9. Seguir\u00e9. A gull landed near enough to look at him with the suspicion all gulls are born with, and he looked back without offering an apology for not having bread. He was a man who had started to like the taste of his own restraint even when he was alone, and he made a note in his book later about not turning restraint into a costume.\n\nOne afternoon he found his mother at the kitchen table counting coins into a jar that had once held peaches. She wasn\u2019t counting because she needed the money; she was counting because sometimes counting is a prayer. He sat and counted with her and she told him, unprompted, about the first winter she and his father had spent together in an apartment with windows that felt like opinions and a stove that surrendered on Tuesdays. She used the past imperfect in English without knowing it, we were always, we used to, and he thought of correcting her grammar as a joke and then thought of how his life had become better when he had learned to let language be a place and not just a tool. She asked if Mara would come for dinner before she left, and he said, maybe, and his mother nodded like she had already prepared two new foldings for the napkins in case.\n\nMara called from the gallery to say that Tom\u00e1s had negotiated something that felt like a victory and felt like a trap and she needed to hear somebody who would not sell anything. He walked to Main in a wind that had decided to be mean and stood inside the glass, which had learned, because of winter, how to be a friend. She stood in front of a piece that looked like grief pretending to be geometry and said she had said no to one thing and yes to another and that she had gotten them in the wrong order and she knew it and she couldn\u2019t fix it and didn\u2019t want him to try. He said, I won\u2019t, because she had trained him to make his convictions simple when she was fragile. She said, tell me a nonpoetic thing about your day, and he told her about a man whose loan had been approved because he had shown up with receipts in a folder organized by month and he had smiled like a person takes a pie from an oven, and she closed her eyes and nodded as if she could smell sugar and butter.\n\nIn February the air tried being kind and failed, but its attempt warmed the sidewalks enough to make people walk like new songs. Benjamin swam and counted laps in Spanish until he forgot which language the numbers belonged to and then counted backwards just to prove that time was not exclusively linear. At the center, the kids wrote their first lines in a book Jill had made for them with cardboard and hope, and the board looked like a wall that had decided to be a window. Mario, never content with his own improvements, asked if there was a tense for when you are about to do something and might not, and Benjamin wrote \u201ctal vez\u201d on the board like a title and told a story about a lake and a woman and a sentence he didn\u2019t say. The children were bored by his melodrama and he loved them for it.\n\nHe took a morning off work to go to a hearing at the city building because he wanted to hear how public speech made its way from throats to the record. He sat through two dog licenses and a celebration of a man who had retired from public service without being caught doing anything spectacular, and then the item came. People stood and said their names and said what corner they lived on because corners make you real. He stood when it was his turn and said his name and his job and said in Spanish a single sentence to the handful who had not been addressed yet\u2014les prometo avisos que se pueden leer y tiempo que se puede contar\u2014and one of the council members who had grown up in the same county that had grown him looked at him with something like pride and something like caution. After, in the hallway, a woman with a baby said gracias in a way that pulled nothing out of him but the right nod. On the steps he found Jill and she looked like someone who had been allowed to nap for nine minutes; she squeezed his wrist without making it a ceremony and said, the trick is not to become a person who loves microphones, and he said, I am too shy, and she said, I have met men who are shy until there is a microphone.\n\nMara asked him, one evening when the lake held rain instead of ice, to drive to Millcreek and walk until the snow stopped lying. He had waited for the invitation and now that it came he answered like a man who had practiced being calm. They walked on packed paths that had learned the shape of boots. The creek was loud enough to suggest a sermon without picking a text. She told him she had been given more money than she had ever held in a single promise to move to a city that believed in itself more than it believed in humility. She told him she could see herself in that faith and hated that she wanted to, and he told her about the email he had sent that morning in Spanish and English because it had begun to feel disrespectful to demand debt in a single tongue. They spoke like people who knew that whatever would happen would not be made or unmade by the sentence they chose next, and that knowledge made them tender.\n\nAt the bend where the trail opens to a view that loves its own drama, she stopped and looked south as if the conversation lived somewhere near the mouth of the canyon. \u201cI keep making a list,\u201d she said, and he braced himself for nouns he could not compete with, and she surprised him by naming verbs. \u201cAprender. Cuidar. Traducir. Desobedecer. Sostener.\u201d He laughed, quietly, because the list was a life and because he recognized it. He added his own, Reformar. Seguir. Corregir. Perdonar. \u201cNot myself,\u201d he added quickly. \u201cNot for heroics. For mechanics.\u201d She looked at him with a soft irritation he had come to recognize as love for a person who refuses to be more romantic than the truth. \u201cYou are dangerous,\u201d she said again, the way she had months ago, and then she took his hand for six steps and then let it go because six steps can be a life if you count them correctly.\n\nThe day the covenants were signed he sat in his office and stared at the scanned document as if the pixels had morality. He had not saved a city. He had bought time for eight families and had made four men slightly annoyed, and he accepted the size of that math. He sent Jill a photograph of the page with the signatures without caption and she responded with the emoji of a cake and then wrote, I owe you something edible, and then, I would have told you to do it anyway if it had failed. He closed his notebook and placed his pen on it as if he were done writing for the day and then wrote one more sentence because nobody gets to be done at three: seguir\u00e9.\n\nNear the end of the month, Mara came over with a bag of mandarins and a face like a person deciding what kind of goodbye she wanted to practice. She held one mandarin up to the light as if testing it for clarity and then set it on the table and said, I said yes, and I need you to practice hearing it without making a face that tries to be noble and ends up scolding me. He breathed once, twice, and put his hands flat on the table as if he were making a church out of a pew. He said, I am proud, and then, I will miss you, and then, I will buy more oranges than I need, because even in this moment he believed in the saving power of small jokes. She sat, and because she had never been cruel to him on purpose and had no intention of starting, she added, I will still be here for months, and the word months sounded both generous and meager. They made a list of places to go without making the list a vow, and he promised to teach her the fold his mother had taught him last, the mountain that sits up on the plate like a small, defiant geography.\n\nThat night he stood at his sink with his hands in dishwater that had given up being hot and said the verb forms out loud like prayers without saints. Voy a seguir. Voy a leer. Voy a abrir la boca cuando sirva. He thought of the first time he had said conejo wrong and Mario had corrected him kindly, of the first time he had read in public and not regretted it at two in the morning, of the first time he had said to his mother hace fr\u00edo and watched her adopt the phrase like a stray. He thought of the lake teaching him that a horizon is a kind of promise that nobody can enforce. He put an orange peel on the edge of the sink and pressed it with his thumb until the oil lifted and stung his skin. He laughed because it hurt and felt awake, and he went to sleep like a person who had negotiated with his own future and decided to meet it one tense at a time.\n\nWhen March arrived with the saddest rain he had ever loved, he and Mara went to the laundromat posada\u2019s quieter cousin, a book distribution where the lights hummed and the dryers spun and nobody sang. He handed picture books to children who accepted them with the gravity of bankers and watched mothers choose between two covers like people choosing futures. The woman with the persimmon scarf, her mailbox now a photograph attached to a file with three signatures, handed him a tub of soup and told him her rent had stopped rising for one month, which is not a miracle but looks like one if you are tired enough. Jill stood on a chair to adjust the string of lights and said, do not climb on things you are not prepared to fall from, and David said, I will catch you, and she said, do not promise that in a room with this much tile.\n\nOn the way home, he and Mara walked under rain that did not have the teeth of snow but had its persistence. She told him that she had begun telling people she would leave and watched their faces and learned something improper and useful about her standing. He told her that a man at the bank had congratulated him on his community work in a tone that meant it was a nice hobby as long as it did not interrupt profit, and she told him not to waste rage on men who practiced compliments as discipline. They stood under a tree that had not yet decided whether to believe in spring and he said, the future isn\u2019t arrogant today, and she said, good, then let\u2019s practice it, and they did, with verbs in both languages like handholds on a wall neither of them owned. He did not kiss her and she did not step back. They made a shape out of weather and grammar and the kind of love that had learned from both to be exact without pretending to be correct.\n\nAt home, Sor Juana waited at the table open to lines he had already marked and would mark again as if repetition were a way to become faithful to yourself. He read the part where desire makes an argument and reason answers with a joke, and he thought of all the mouths that had said te quiero and not meant it, and of his own that had practiced sentences the way a man practices an instrument when the audience is still asleep. He wrote a letter he would not send, as was his habit, and in it he did not say I love you. He said instead, I will be here when you want to practice the conditional, and, I will bring napkins to any place that slices oranges, and, I will remember to breathe when you tell me to and when you don\u2019t. He folded the letter into the book as if it were only another scrap of paper, and he slept hard enough to believe in morning.",
