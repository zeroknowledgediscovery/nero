     "novel_text": "The morning they turned, I was watching a tee shot hold the wind like a kite.\n\nIt was early, that not-quite-blue hour that golf people hoard like misers. Dew on the fairways of the municipal course out past the river, maintenance guys muttering, a distant herring gull scissoring apart a take-out box. I had the place to myself except for Tam, who wore her wool cap over a too-messy bun and held the shag bag like it was a reliquary. She\u2019s been my caddie since before the tour, before my first sponsor, back when my shoes were unstitching and my wrists were raw with tape. She knew the arc of my drives better than I did. She knew when I was going to top it by the way my jaw set.\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d she said, as the ball climbed and climbed, catching an angle in the cold air I hadn\u2019t seen before. \u201cHear that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hear a five-iron doing what it was told.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cSome kind of\u2026 choir.\u201d\n\nI tilted my head. Nothing but the low hum of the highway, the mosquitoes that never slept, distant dogs arguing with their own chains. And then, like a whale surfacing in a dark sea, sound. A draped shimmer, an organ pipe bent around itself. Not in the air, though. Inside. My skull bones ringing. A long, braided note that felt like peppermint on a cracked lip.\n\nThe ball hung and hung, then descended in a way that made Tam, who hates poetry, say, \u201cThat was like a moth. Like it decided.\u201d\n\n\u201cWind shift,\u201d I said. \u201cThermals.\u201d\n\nThe note unspooled into other notes, thin silver threads. Tam dropped the shag bag. She put both hands to her ears, eyes gone bright and wet. Twenty miles away, I learned later, a man kneeling on a cheap laminate kitchen floor still wearing his fast-food visor began to weep and couldn\u2019t stop. He had been dead for nineteen years. He was a vampire.\n\nThere had always been vampires. Not the old story: cloaks and crumbling castles, not velvet-lined coffins bought at estate sales. Ours were ordinary. They used bleach. They cut their hair with kitchen scissors. They paid for parking and fought with their phones. They left you alone mostly. Not always\u2014once, long ago, in desire or hunger, they had not. But by the time I was a teenager they were part of the weather. They worked double shifts. They sat on bus benches and read the same paper as us. They smelled faintly of old coins and rain.\n\nThe choir happened at 3:16 a.m. in some countries and at lunchtime in others and at exactly in the middle of your nap wherever you were, because that\u2019s how fate arranges itself, with rudeness. Every vampire I\u2019ve ever known fell to his knees or her knees or their knees. They shed their bodies like jackets and rose into a light that made noise. I say rose, but it was less physical than that, more like they remembered a note and chased it up. Held together by mathematics and grief, they were new things. Not winged men. Not cherubs. Not anything that would fit inside a church painting. They were angles and brightness and attention. They were angels because we needed a word.\n\nWe called it the Turning because we turn things that change\u2014soil, pages, faces toward the light.\n\nThe first one I saw came from the pro shop. He had been working there for years, a quiet, mostly-silent man named colin in lower-case because he hated his name and refused to give it the dignity of capitals. For a decade he\u2019d measured out soft spikes and glove sizes. I brought him muffins on Mondays because I suspected he had no one else who did. He had been a vampire, though I didn\u2019t know that then, until he crumpled behind the counter, the flimsy plexiglass register guard trembling after he was already not-there. What rose from him was a geometry of light that touched the ceiling, the racks of branded polos, a jar of tees with tongue-in-cheek slogans I never bought. It touched me. On my right cheek. The way my mother\u2019s hand used to, absent and exact, while looking the other way toward a pot on the stove. Its touch was a measurement, a line from me to some unknown apex. It burned just enough to wake up a piece of me that had been drowsy all this time.\n\nTam said, \u201cRhea, your face.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lit like you\u2019re radiating from inside out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I said, but I was.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think he was one,\u201d she said, looking at colin\u2019s holiday mug, last year\u2019s cabernet shopping list in his half-printed half-cursive stuck under a magnet shaped like a golfing koala. \u201cI didn\u2019t think any of them still were.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not anymore,\u201d I said.\n\nWe walked out under a sky that had become a bowl of ringing notes. People were emerging onto their porches, some in slippers, some tugging at their sleeves as if to wake up. A maintenance guy dropped a rake that had been patched with duct tape. The head pro, gray-bearded and unapproachable as a granite hill, stood in the doorway like a picture of someone waiting for a bus that would never arrive. All over the river and the city beyond, pinpoints of rising light. On the news a woman tried to keep her eyes on the camera while looking past it at something above her that made her mouth make an O and stay that way.\n\nAnd in that shimmering, in the glissade of breathless hours after the Turning, the old maps curled and peeled and there was a new, impossible atlas beneath. The club members, the early risers with their range tokens and their complicated wives, knelt experimentally, as if praying would please the new weather. A teenager vaped and forgot, smoke pouring like a small personal fog as he stared upward. In the corner of the putting green, a cluster of six angel-shapes hovered like a bouquet of night-blooming plants. They didn\u2019t touch the ground but the grass under them was pressed down as if by a good, heavy snow.\n\nIt smelled like ozone, like fresh water poured into old holes.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go near,\u201d Tam said. Her hands were fists in her pockets.\n\nI did, because I had always lacked that part of the brain that believes warnings are anything other than metaphors. A bright figure uncurled toward me. When they talk about angels in old books, the writers often get shy and resort to obscurity. I used to think that was because the writers were cowards; now I know it\u2019s because there aren\u2019t words for some of it. This one had an outline, if by outline you mean the idea of an outline, and the idea suggested was \u201chuman.\u201d A suggestion of shoulders, a suggestion of teeth that were not teeth. A brightness that would be searing if you hated yourself, but if you didn\u2019t, was bearable. In that brightness a shadow like a bruise moved, slow as a cloud.\n\n\u201cRhea Moss,\u201d it said, although it didn\u2019t speak.\n\nI nodded as if to a starter before the horn. Because when a new thing has your name in its mouth, you nod. You pretend you expected it.\n\n\u201cYou used to\u2014\u201d I started.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d it said. Or sang. Or arranged the air so that yes was what I heard. A voice like a hole cut in the fabric of a lie.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want,\u201d I said, which was not what I meant. What I meant was, Who are you now. What I meant was, Is this why you liked watching me putt. What I meant was, Do you love me.\n\n\u201cI was called Velez,\u201d it said. Not its real name, of course. A name used like a shirt. The vampire I had met once in an alley behind the course seven years before. It had been a hot night and I was waiting for Tam to return with the car. My second-hand bag was leaning against the dumpster. The alley belonged to grease, to two green-tinted fluorescent lights, to the dumpster lid that never closed all the way. Velez had stepped from behind an exhaust pipe as if unspooling from a smell. Tall then. Narrow face. Bleached hair done badly. Thirsty eyes, but controlled, like a dancer watching whose hand holds the blade. He had said, \u201cYou swing like you can hear things.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can hear my coach yelling inside my head,\u201d I\u2019d said. He had smiled without teeth. He had watched me for a while and then said nothing and then, with the exact sadness of someone leaving the opera before the last act, he had left.\n\n\u201cIt was you,\u201d I said now.\n\n\u201cIt is I,\u201d the angel said.\n\nI hadn\u2019t had enough coffee for this. My palms itched. In the pro shop, colin\u2019s mug still steamed with whatever tea he liked. Outside, a woman in black leggings stopped mid-run and lifted her hands to the air, as if to catch a ball no one had thrown.\n\n\u201cThis is\u2026 good,\u201d I said, because a person needs a stance at the start of a very long, very strange day.\n\n\u201cThis is not simple,\u201d the angel said gently. Every light in it quivered. \u201cWe are not what people think we are. The word will help, and also it will not.\u201d\n\nTam clanked a club in the bag, a little warning. She does that when she wants me to retreat. A code we\u2019ve developed like birds. The angel turned its attention to her without looking. Her cap trembled.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want with me,\u201d I said again, being the sort of person who repeats the true question awhile until it gives up its secrets.\n\n\u201cYour game is a way to talk about other things,\u201d Velez said.\n\n\u201cThat sounds like a fortune cookie.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou aim at quiet and you make it with motion.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting weird,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cEverything is odd, now,\u201d it said, almost apologizing for the world.\n\nAngels were filling the day like a tide. On the television in the clubhouse, somebody had turned on the news and it showed footage of a hospital in Nairobi where a nurse screamed and then knelt and then laughed, showing a gap between her front teeth. In front of the hospital, an angel hovering near the jacaranda tree turned the purple blossoms into a cascade of honey bees, but the bees did not sting. They spelled something in the air in a language only the tree understood.\n\nTam said, \u201cWe should go.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo where.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo your apartment,\u201d she said, as if it were a fort.\n\nI watched another angel tilt itself toward the river, light sliding off the water, making everything too real, cruelly precise. \u201cWe can,\u201d I said, but I didn\u2019t move.\n\nVelez\u2014no longer Velez but for convenience we used the old shirts we had\u2014folded more brightness around itself until it looked less like ten thousand prisms and more like one thing. \u201cThere is a set of questions that will rearrange themselves around you,\u201d it said. \u201cStand there. Let them do the rearranging.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I supposed to do something,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou are going to have to decide something that no living person has decided,\u201d the angel said. \u201cBut not today. Today put the clubs in the trunk. Drink water. When you talk, do it like a person who remembers the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cDecide what,\u201d Tam said darkly. \u201cDecide between what and what.\u201d\n\nThe angel lifted its non-face toward the treeline as if listening to a far-away train. \u201cHeat,\u201d it said softly. \u201cCold. Staying. Leaving. There are planets in need of names.\u201d\n\nI laughed. It wasn\u2019t a pretty laugh. It was sharp and too loud in the morning air. \u201cWe can\u2019t even land a par on the third when the wind is up,\u201d I said. \u201cNow planets.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are a person with a driver in your hand who understands distance,\u201d the angel said. \u201cYou are a person who has stood in crowds and not lost the thread of your own breath. That is a kind of leadership. It\u2019s the beginning of one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a golfer,\u201d I said, suddenly angry for no good reason, because that was the thing I was and I had made peace with how small it was. \u201cI hit a ball with a stick and then chase it and hit it again, and sometimes people clap because the angle of my wrist is consistent over time. That\u2019s all. Don\u2019t turn it into a metaphor to make me feel better about this,\u201d I said, and surprised myself by sounding like my mother, who never got the hang of the internet and had made peace with that too.\n\nVelez\u2019s brightness dimmed and then deepened like breathing. \u201cIt will not feel better,\u201d it said. \u201cAnd we are not here to philosophize. We cannot lead you. You would not survive our leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why talk,\u201d Tam said.\n\n\u201cBecause we can tell you where not to step,\u201d it said, and for a moment there was a shadow in it like old shame. \u201cBecause we can sing to you about what we did wrong.\u201d\n\nAcross the fairway, a tall shape moved. At first I thought it was the head pro finally coming to tell us to clear out, that even in apocalypse there were things to be done. But it was a woman in a dark suit, shoes ungrassy. She hurried toward us with a face like the sky right before hail.\n\n\u201cMoss?\u201d she said, out of breath.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, because I was still me.\n\nShe held out a badge that meant nothing to me. Script letters, a seal with a ship. How many seals we invent to keep ourselves from drowning in each other\u2019s doubt. \u201cMinister Holm,\u201d she said. \u201cInterim\u2026 Well. None of that matters. I coordinate the city\u2019s emergency response.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat must be going well,\u201d Tam said, because fear shortens her fuse and sharpens her jokes to needles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Holm said. She was sweating through her collar. \u201cYou were named.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody named me,\u201d I said. \u201cI had a nickname once, but\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cJust now. On Channel 4. On God knows how many channels,\u201d she said. \u201cIn a statement made by\u2014\u201d She looked sideways at Velez, and her eyes did a strange thing, a hardness like a skin pulled tight over them. \u201cBy one of those. It said your actual name. It said to begin by finding you. It said, \u2018Tell Rhea Moss what we told you to tell her.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an absent pronoun,\u201d I said, as if that was the point.\n\nHolm\u2019s mouth made a line. \u201cI have a team. Scientists. Linguists. A person who studies\u2014\u201d She gestured helplessly at Velez. \u201cMy sister is at St. Agnes and she has not stopped crying since five-forty a.m. Also one of my dogs is floating four inches off the tile and won\u2019t come down. We are not okay. Will you come with me. Please.\u201d\n\nTam stepped forward, between me and Holm with the ease of a guard. \u201cTo do what,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTo be debriefed and then briefed,\u201d Holm said. \u201cTo ask questions. To listen. To tell us what the thing told you five seconds ago.\u201d\n\nVelez made a sound like a bell shaken and then gripped in a hand. \u201cGo,\u201d it said to me. \u201cI cannot protect you on the ground. But I can stand nearby in the air. It\u2019s not nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean you can hover and look majestic,\u201d Tam said.\n\n\u201cAmong other things,\u201d it said mildly. \u201cWe are newly made. We do not understand our limits yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Holm said, and for a moment I saw past the minister to the person who had eaten toast this morning quickly, without tasting, while the radio mispronounced its fear at her. She had a faint glitter at her collarbone, sweat or tears. I\u2019ve never liked being told what to do. But I also know when first practice is over and it\u2019s time to tee off.\n\nI tossed Tam the keys. \u201cBring the bag,\u201d I said. \u201cAll of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of it?\u201d\n\n\u201cEven the putter I hate.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hate all of them at some point,\u201d she muttered, but she hoisted the bag and followed.\n\nWe drove in Holm\u2019s car, a black thing with too many dials, through a city we knew but didn\u2019t. Clouds threw themselves apart. People were hugging at crosswalks. A man pushed a piano from a storefront onto the sidewalk and played it very badly and with great seriousness, as if to see if music still worked. Above us, angels flickered like strange birds in a storm. In the rearview I watched one dip low over a nursing home and then lift, and as it lifted, several windows opened at once from the inside, hands reaching into the air as if it were velvet, as if one might catch a bit and keep it in a drawer.\n\n\u201cWhat did it say,\u201d Holm said into the windshield.\n\n\u201cIt said my name,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI heard,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt said I should drink water,\u201d I said, because the least important things sometimes feel like the anchors.\n\n\u201cI can get you water,\u201d Holm said, and we all laughed, the brittle kind. I looked at Tam and saw that her eyes had that wild wetness I fear: the one that means, If you try to leave me, I\u2019ll turn into a map of your leaving and thus you will never be lost and thus you will always be wrong. I nodded to her, the kind of nod that says it all without explaining anything: stay, go, breathe, I don\u2019t know.\n\nWe arrived at an ugly building that had been ugly before the Turning and would be ugly after any apocalypse. Inside was a room with a table, and in the room were people who looked like they had not slept and were brimming with more words than they knew where to put. Dr. Sana Ortega introduced herself while putting her hair up with a pencil. Her eyes were like cut wood. She shook my hand dryly and didn\u2019t let go too long. \u201cYou were named,\u201d she said, as if we both needed to practice saying it.\n\n\u201cWe keep saying that,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the kind of day where we repeat nouns,\u201d she said. \u201cSit. This is\u2014\u201d She pointed: a linguist named Dana who wore earplugs although it was quiet; a physicist who introduced himself as Kit and then immediately corrected that to Kieran and then laughed as if that mattered to how matter behaves; a city council person who had been recently promoted without wanting to; a priest who was not in collar and whose eyes were red rimmed; two interns who looked like they\u2019d grown three inches this morning.\n\nThe screen on the wall showed faces from other rooms. This is the decade of faces being rectangles stacked in other rectangles. They looked at me too hard. I looked back because that\u2019s a skill you learn when people look at you to figure out who they should be.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Sana said. \u201cTell us. Don\u2019t worry about whether you\u2019re making sense. The truth will sort itself. It usually does, not fast enough.\u201d\n\nI said nothing at first. I was thinking of the first time I held a driver as a kid and realized that this was a stick that could erase and invent.\n\n\u201cIt knew my name,\u201d I said. \u201cIt said we\u2019re going to have to \u2018decide something no one alive has decided.\u2019 It mentioned planets. It told me to drink water.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlanets,\u201d Kieran said. \u201cPlural.\u201d\n\nI nodded.\n\n\u201cDo you think\u2014\u201d Dana started, and then put a hand in the air. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask it badly. Do you think they mean we should see other planets, like tour them, or that we should live there.\u201d\n\n\u201cColonize,\u201d the priest said grimly, and then flinched at the word as if it had bitten him. \u201cIs that the word we\u2019re using again.\u201d\n\nSana leaned forward. \u201cWe knew something was coming,\u201d she said. \u201cOther than this, I mean. Seismic weirdness. The glacier data. The slow roll of ocean heat. There have been nights lately where the stars looked\u2014wrong. Or too vivid. Or too arranged.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr like the paintings you\u2019d see in dentist offices,\u201d Dana said. \u201cThe ones with the wet road at night and just a little bit of tail lights\u2014\u201d She looked abashed at the analogy. \u201cSorry. There\u2019s no real language.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf everything is still, it\u2019s only because the mechanism has become a wheel,\u201d the priest murmured, as if reciting.\n\n\u201cThey told us,\u201d Holm said, and her voice hopped like a windy umbrella. \u201cThey told us on the broadcast that the Earth is ending.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefine ending,\u201d I said, and heard my own voice sound like a hollow object.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to,\u201d Sana said, and rubbed the pencil through her hair and made a mess. \u201cIn how many days, months\u2014? They were very bad with the number. The number was spoken and then sung and then shown as an image of a hand closing and then as a shadow moving across cress. We\u2019re translating across forms. But roughly. Roughly. Two and a half years.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlenty of time,\u201d Kieran said, and then covered his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cApology accepted as soon as I figure out who is owed it,\u201d Holm said.\n\nWe sat there. Sometimes the sitting is the work. Tam, at the back of the room, leaned against the wall and stared at the ceiling like she could see into the floor above. I thought of my apartment\u2019s plant, a rubber plant that refuses to die, proof that some things like neglect. I thought of my mother, who used to stand in the kitchen after doing the dishes and stare at nothing, not because she was contemplating death but because if she put down the dish towel she would not know what to do with her hands. I thought of a map of the night sky pinned above my teenage bed, a poster someone gave me free at the planetarium that I kept because it glowed.\n\n\u201cWhy me,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m nobody. I\u2019m good at something that mattered yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really think that,\u201d Sana said. It wasn\u2019t a question.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t not think it,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked my whole life to be good at playing a game. That\u2019s not nothing. But it\u2019s also not telling a million people where to put their bodies so they don\u2019t die.\u201d\n\nTam said, \u201cMaybe they don\u2019t want a leader who likes pointing. Maybe they want someone who gestures.\u201d\n\nIn the corner of the room, as if called by being discussed, a softness brightened, and Velez entered without using the door. Holm flinched, and then pretended she hadn\u2019t by adjusting her shoe. Sana took a deep breath in and out. I watched the intern\u2019s face do the kind of joy that makes you suspicious of your own bones.\n\n\u201cWe cannot say you are nobody,\u201d Velez said. \u201cThat would be an unkindness to language. You are Rhea Moss. In certain games people whisper your name like a place they went once that they didn\u2019t want to leave.\u201d\n\nNobody moved. The building\u2019s vents hummed a low, tired note. Outside, a siren tried to keep doing the job it once had.\n\n\u201cYou would like us to choose someone else,\u201d Velez said, its voice almost amused. \u201cYou have never wanted the microphone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like microphones because they make my own voice sound like a person I would not follow,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t lead the world,\u201d I added, hearing the absurdity and wanting to hold it like a pet. \u201cI can\u2019t even finish a round sometimes when my own breathing goes weird.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can because you must and you will hate it,\u201d the angel said. \u201cBut hate is not a disqualifier. Sometimes it is a kind of faith.\u201d\n\nSana glanced at me with eyes that flickered like candlelight. \u201cIf this were a movie,\u201d she said, \u201cthis is the scene where you say no three times and then fate conspires to yes. But I don\u2019t think this is a movie. I think we all have to be wrong and keep going.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do the angels want,\u201d the priest asked Velez. \u201cReally. Not the soft version. The sharp one.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be forgiven,\u201d Velez said without hesitation. The room exhaled, a sound like a seabird giving up. \u201cTo witness. To sing so a thing doesn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s an ugly word. A folding. The world will crease along a line we cannot smooth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of line,\u201d Kieran asked, for whom lines were everything.\n\n\u201cImagine paper,\u201d the angel said. \u201cThen imagine it learning about wet. Then imagine a hand wanting a boat without knowing how to float. It folds. The paper is still paper. It is a boat now. But the water is the law, and law is not sentimental. We cannot force the float.\u201d\n\nHolm made a sound, not laughter. \u201cThat was approximate as hell,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I understood it anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Velez said. \u201cWe will be imprecise and we will still arrive at true.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo planets,\u201d Sana said briskly, pulling us back from metaphor like pulling a dog from a river. \u201cDo you have coordinates. Are there ships. Do you carry them inside your\u2014\u201d She gestured at the angel as if there might be a pocket.\n\n\u201cWe have the songs of places,\u201d Velez said. \u201cThink of them as addresses. We do not have ships. We are the opposite of a ship. We resist shape.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have rockets,\u201d Kieran said, then winced. \u201cI mean. We have\u2026 a few. We have budgets that were not approved. We have plans with corners missing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have nothing,\u201d Holm said, and this time it was not despair but the bluntness of someone taking stock.\n\n\u201cNot nothing,\u201d Tam said from the wall, and I wanted to kiss her for that. \u201cWe have hands. We have people who go out when it rains with buckets and try. You can do more than you think if your shoulder remembers the angle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is insane,\u201d I said, finally. \u201cNo one is going to listen to a golfer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will listen to you because we say so,\u201d Velez said, and I hated the way my stomach roiled at the thought. \u201cThat is the worst reason for someone to listen, but sometimes it is the only one that works long enough to find a better one.\u201d\n\nLater, after too many forms were printed and then abandoned, after an intern brought me water in a paper cup and cried when I thanked him for a small thing, after Sana scrawled on the whiteboard until the pen squealed, we went back to the course. It had become a place people came to because they needed a place to stand. The grass had never been so trampled by sneakers. Someone had set a bowl of fruit on the starter\u2019s table, as if to feed a god. The angels huddled in groups, superficially like birds at a pond, actually not like anything at all.\n\nVelez hovered over the seventeenth because it is a hole I have always loved: a dogleg with a stupid bunker that bullies me. Evening came down the way a parent comes down the stairs after a too-long silence: suspicious of joy. People sat on their heels or their hope. The tree line stood still. A woman with a baby at her chest rocked and hummed, and the baby watched her mother\u2019s mouth out of the corner of his eye, as if it were the moon.\n\nOn the tee box, the air changed pressure. If this sounds like a lie, it is because language doesn\u2019t have braille for it yet. Ears popped. The hair on arms shook awake. Above us assembled a shape that was a choir. Not one angel, not fifty, a formation like a swarm caught in decision. They made a low sound and it scraped gooseflesh up spine bones and all the memories that lived there uninvited.\n\nThey said, without sound, in a way that made children hear it as lullaby and scientists hear it as a data dump: We have been made new and we are not your judges. We have been made from your dark things and our dark things and we will pretend not to be bad at pretending. We have three things.\n\nOne: A sentence that cannot be unmade. The world will fold. You cannot stop it with repentance, with money, with a clever hinge. Some of you will think you can. That thought will be useful, briefly, in that it will produce energy. Harness it with kindness. Do not let it turn you cruel.\n\nTwo: Songs of other places where your bodies could learn to breathe. We cannot guarantee a life there. We cannot guarantee anything. We can tell you where the ground says yes when paired with the right boots.\n\nThree: Names. Names are how you begin. One of the names is Rhea Moss.\n\nI wanted to look behind me and see if there was someone else. Wanting that was like wanting backward rain.\n\nThey called my name a second time and the sound of it made me an infant and an old woman at once. Time buckled. I thought of the first time I read the rule book and realized the rules were less about behaving than about agreeing where the lines were so we could invent them again together the next Sunday.\n\nWe will speak to your leaders. We will not choose them for you. We will not stop your wars. We will sing outside the door while you wrestle and bribe and cry and cut and forgive. We say the name so that the room remembers a different shape it could take.\n\nThe baby at the woman\u2019s chest hiccuped as if something delighted him. It was absurd. It was perfect.\n\nSomeone behind me said, too loud, \u201cShe plays a game,\u201d and someone else said, \u201cExactly,\u201d and it made my throat close.\n\nVelez drifted nearer until the brightness washed my hands and made the veins in them map-blue. I imagined every blister I\u2019d ever had, all the small pains that had kept me awake at night, and thought, If all the pains in the world were put in order from smallest to largest, where would mine live. The answer did not matter. But asking was a kind of worship.\n\n\u201cWe will give you the song now,\u201d the choir said, and they poured a sequence into the air. It was at once a sound and a temperature. It smelled like the inside of a clean ceramic mug, like wet bark cut by a pocket knife, like pennies and peach skin. It was coordinates if coordinates were a lullaby. Later, Kieran would sit with it and transcribe and cry and then wipe his face and laugh and then cough, bent over, as if clearing a pipe. For now it was just the feeling of a far-off lake in summer where the mosquitoes had agreed to leave you alone one blessed evening and you didn\u2019t question it.\n\nI understood nothing and everything. The green trembled under my shoes. The bunker waited with its old patience. The angels finished. The crowd did not clap. We stood in a silence that was not silence; it was something packed, a held breath in the body of the city.\n\nThen everyone did the thing you do at weddings, at airports, at funerals. They began to speak at once about practicalities that had nothing and everything to do with the biggest thing. Did you bring sunscreen. Does the bus even run now. How is your mother. My phone is dead. Where will we put the people who had planned to be buried when the ground is planning to be water. Do you believe any of this. I can\u2019t feel my teeth. No, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine. We will remember how to be good.\n\nTam tugged my sleeve. \u201cHey,\u201d she said softly.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. My voice was lost somewhere between here and tomorrow.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to do this,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what the this is. But I know I\u2019m going to be there when you do it or don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d I said, trying to smile. \u201cYou\u2019ll end up giving speeches and you hate microphones more than I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll stand behind you and hold your jacket so you don\u2019t do that thing where you hunch,\u201d she said, and she made the shape of the hunch with her body and for a second we were just us, and the word planetary didn\u2019t have anywhere to land near our shoes.\n\nThe air smelled like rain though the forecast had been clear. Every forecast would be wrong now, permanently.\n\nAt home that night, my sibling Jun called. On the screen he looked like a face that was trying not to be a face: eyes smudged, hair with that roof-lift look of someone who had been running their hands through it. He is younger than me by seven years and he is, often, smarter.\n\n\u201cRhee,\u201d he said. He calls me that when he wants me to know he is in the room emotionally even if he is not. \u201cWhat is happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething big and something little,\u201d I said. \u201cNone of them our fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cried in the grocery store\u2019s canned beans aisle,\u201d he said. \u201cA woman I didn\u2019t know handed me a lemon. We both looked at it like it was a bomb and then laughed. Is this what we are now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we have always been also this,\u201d I said. \u201cJust less lit from the side.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re on the internet,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re a meme. They\u2019ve photoshopped you into every painting with an angel. Even the ugly ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m spectacular under oil paint,\u201d I said, because it was the smallest joke I could manage.\n\nJun swallowed. \u201cThey picked you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey said my name,\u201d I said truthfully.\n\n\u201cYou can do it,\u201d he said, as if what it was were a party trick. \u201cYou practice in the rain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want me to help everyone move house,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big house.\u201d\n\nJun\u2019s face did a thing like he had breathed in too much night air. \u201cMom would have\u2014\u201d he began and stopped.\n\n\u201cMom would have made sandwiches,\u201d I said. \u201cBig ones. And then worried about the mustard stain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014 I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do. I can make spreadsheets. I can drive. I can fetch. I can hold water while someone drinks it and not make it about me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe safe,\u201d I said, which is the lie we tell because we need the shape of it between us and the cliff.\n\nAfter we hung up, I sat at the small table that was not designed for destiny and put my head down on its warm, soft wood. The rubber plant leaned toward me like a bad actor and then remembered to be a plant. Out the window the city did what cities do: flickered between panic and joking, between siren and shuffle, between singing and sleep. Somewhere, someone was making a chart with a pencil that had a bite mark on it. Somewhere an angel was telling a child that none of this was a punishment, though some would want to make it one. Somewhere the men who had always loved weapons were polishing them with the kind of care they never gave their own bones.\n\nMy phone pinged with a message from an unknown number:\n\nMy father says hello. He was a patient of yours. At night. By the range. He says your swing made a sound he thought he\u2019d never hear again. He says thank you. Also. He says sorry.\n\nI put the phone face down on the table and watched the little light pulse for longer than was useful. The angels were above the city in their assembly language. The golfers of the world were arguing in comment sections. The dogs were confused. The cats were pretending it had all been their idea.\n\nIt would be a while before I slept. And when I did, I dreamt of a fairway as wide as a desert and a flag made of starlings and a bunker filled with salt. In the dream my father, who had never cared for golf because he thought it was for people who had too much time, stood beside me holding a measuring tape that unspooled and unspooled and never found an end.\n\nI woke to the sound of morning news like always, except the newsreader\u2019s voice broke when she said the word ordinary. The city\u2019s mayor had made a statement; it had said exactly what statements say and nothing of what they mean. The President had tweeted and then deleted the tweet. A preacher somewhere had told his congregation that they were chosen because they had prayed louder than other congregations and then his wife had hiccuped loudly into the microphone and the choir had laughed and the laughing had saved them from themselves for four minutes.\n\nThe angels at dawn made a shape over the river that was maybe a map and maybe a warning. Velez hovered outside my window like a bad idea or a brave one.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said into the glass, my breath making a cloud that vanished too fast. \u201cHere we go.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d he agreed. \u201cWe go,\u201d and then he told me the first of the songs again because I had forgotten it already, and because forgetting is the ocean and remembering is the shore and you can stand between them only for a while without being changed.\n\nPeople knock on doors when they are asking for signatures to get onto ballots. They knock on doors when they are selling magazine subscriptions you forgot were still a thing. They knock on doors when they have come to ask for help or to apologize. That morning the knock on mine was careful, no urgency, no apology, and it said: opportunity, inevitability, both.\n\nI opened it to find Minister Holm holding a stack of papers and a pen that had viscera on it from being bitten. Sana was behind her with a thermos that said COFFEE in a documentary font. Tam leaned in the hallway like a guardian whose sword was sarcasm. And over them, like a lampshade on the very idea of us, Velez.\n\n\u201cWe need to write a speech,\u201d Holm said, swallowing. \u201cAnd by we, I mean you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can be short,\u201d Sana added, because she is a blessing. \u201cIt can be just: Hello. I am a person. We have a plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a plan,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWe will have one by the time you get to the words about the plan,\u201d she said. \u201cStart the sentence. The sentence will grow around it.\u201d\n\nI looked at the papers and saw that all of them had my name on them in typefaces that tried to be serious. \u201cDo I have to wear a suit,\u201d I said, and for the first time since the Turning I heard my own voice sound like I liked it.\n\n\u201cYou can wear exactly what you were going to wear,\u201d Tam said, and I looked down and saw that I was wearing the hoodie with the frayed cuff and pants with a grass stain that had refused bleach like a stubborn saint. \u201cIt\u2019s not a fashion show. It\u2019s the end of the world,\u201d she said, and then caught herself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d I said. \u201cTrue things don\u2019t need apologizing, just handling.\u201d\n\nAnd that was how it began. Not with trumpets. With a tee time no one wanted but which, having been found on the schedule, we could not ignore. With a woman from the city who had given up on her dogs touching the floor and with a scientist who believed that if you put enough graphs under enough light they would become a hallway. With my caddie, who knew when my hands were lying. With an angel who had once taught me how not to be afraid of my own wrists in the moonlight. With paper. With water. With a small word at the start of a large sentence, and with the knowledge that there were planets in the dark with our possible names hanging over them like unripe fruit, that someday maybe we\u2019d bite into and wince and keep eating anyway.\n\nI wrote the first words down. I crossed them out. I wrote them again.\n\nHello. I am a person. We have a plan.Chapter 3 started at my kitchen table because every epoch starts somewhere graceless, with crumbs and a ring of coffee left by a thermos that promised eternally hot and delivered almost. Holm spread the papers like a card trick she didn\u2019t believe in. Sana set down her thermos and unscrewed the lid with that scientific precision that makes you trust a person with hard news. Tam stood behind my chair, arms crossed, using posture like armor. Velez hovered in a way that would have been theatrical if theater had ever been that specific about light. The rubber plant leaned toward the scene, performing curiosity. I had slept an hour and a half and it had been full of numbers without units.\n\n\u201cSay it like you mean it,\u201d Holm said, as if meaning were something you could pour into the hollow of a syllable and trust it to set. \u201cSay it like you are not asking for permission.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am asking for permission,\u201d I said. \u201cFrom everybody. To be in their heads with my voice for five minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen ask like you know they\u2019ll grant it,\u201d Sana said. She slid a pen across the table and it made that soft whisper that pens make when they want to be useful. \u201cWe can\u2019t script a day. We can script a first breath. Start with the small words. They hang better.\u201d\n\nI wrote, slowly because speed feels like lying when your hand isn\u2019t sure, Hello. I am a person. We have a plan. The words looked like they\u2019d been caught in the act of being, half naked. I stared at them until they were just shapes and then I looked away so they could be words again. Tam reached over my shoulder and tugged my hoodie hood so it lay flat and didn\u2019t make me look hunched. Sometimes her caretaking irritates me the way gravel irritates an oyster. Sometimes it makes pearls out of my day.\n\n\u201cTone?\u201d Holm asked the ceiling, because sometimes you ask a roof for what you want from a crowd. \u201cNo miracles. No beautiful suffering. Practical hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I talk about buckets,\u201d I said, \u201cwill they think I\u2019m making fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about buckets, they\u2019ll think you\u2019ve never been to a flooded basement,\u201d Tam said. \u201cSay the thing with the word that fits in a coat pocket. Nothing with wings. We\u2019re full up on wings.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell them the number,\u201d Sana said quietly. \u201cNot the precise one. The true one. Two and a half years is a long time and no time. They need to feel both.\u201d\n\nVelez dimmed and brightened like a creature remembering that it was also an equation. \u201cSay that we will be wrong,\u201d it said. \u201cSay that wrong is a path if you keep walking and don\u2019t build a house there.\u201d\n\nI wrote that down even though I hated it. I hate it when a thing that sounds like a fortune cookie is also the only thing there is to say.\n\nWe argued about the third paragraph the way you argue about whether to take a five iron or a six when the wind is doing a small dishonest thing. Holm wanted a list because lists calm people who are addicted to chaos. Sana wanted a story because stories give chaos a chair. Tam wanted a promise that we would not build a fence and then only open it for the prettiest. I wanted to stand very still until the responsibility slid off my shoulders like rain. Velez wanted us to explain that angels would not be in charge under any circumstances because power loves a costume and theirs glowed too much.\n\n\u201cTell them about the hubs,\u201d Holm said finally, the word coming out as if it had grown teeth on the way. \u201cSchools. Gyms. Churches. Community centers with roofs we know the names of. If you tell them where to go tomorrow, they\u2019ll sleep tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a plan for those yet,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWe do by the time you say the word hubs,\u201d Sana said. \u201cWe have a hundred clipboards and a million hands. That is plan shaped. The rest is hinges.\u201d\n\nWe practiced. Practice is how I have tricked my own fear for years, making it believe it is seeing the thing twice when it is only seeing the thing once with a rehearsal stitched to it. I stood beside my kitchen counter and held a wooden spoon because microphones are just fancier spoons. Tam made me pause between sentences the way she makes me breathe over a putt. Holm timed me with a watch that looked expensive and cheap at once, like a politician. Sana filmed and winced and then said the word good as if it were a rare material. Velez did not speak, which was also a kind of speaking.\n\nThey took me to the municipal building that had always pretended to be a temple without being one. Steps. Flags. A broad square that had seen protests and farmers\u2019 markets and a meatball tasting contest that went to fistfights. The air had a clarity that scared me. There is a way the day looks when something has just died, even if you can\u2019t yet say what. The square was newcomers to dawn: people holding handmade signs that did not demand so much as offer. WATER, one said. LISTEN, said another, as if it were a verb we could press into bricks. Someone had drawn an angel in sidewalk chalk and given it roller skates because kids know everything and spare you the explanation.\n\nThe platform looked like a cart without wheels. There were microphones clustered like flowers around a grave. Cameras perched like too-interested birds. Holm whispered to someone with a clipboard that looked like a passport to a place you wouldn\u2019t want to visit. The Mayor shook my hand and the shaking was actually a network of twitches that made a rhythm of panic through bone. A man with a priest\u2019s face but a carpenter\u2019s hands stood near the edge of the stage and looked at the crowd as if he\u2019d been asked to count them and couldn\u2019t because they were not rocks, they were water. Tam squeezed my shoulders, one then the other, in our old pattern: left for the body I have, right for the body I think I have.\n\nI stepped up and the crowd made the kind of sound crowds make when they don\u2019t know if they\u2019re about to be entertained or sent home. I put my hand on the wooden edge of the podium and thought of the grain of a driver, the way wood still remembers tree even when it\u2019s pretending to be equipment. Above us the angels had arranged themselves in a configuration I refused to call a halo. It was more like a mobile hung by a nervous parent over a crib, slightly off-center so it would spin slow.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d I said, and I made my voice walk instead of run. \u201cI am a person. We have a plan.\u201d\n\nThere is a kind of hush that is not silence but a gathering. It has weight. It pressed down over my scalp and made me feel like I had put my head under a tap. I took a breath to swallow it. I told them the number as a fact without embellishment. I said, \u201cTwo and a half years. That is enough time to do something human,\u201d and I watched people translate that word into their own kitchens.\n\nI talked about hubs like benches in a park where you go when you are lost or waiting for the person you love. I said, \u201cGo to the place with caged basketball hoops and melting red punch stains on the floor. Go to the place with a stage where the children once argued about who gets to be a tree. Go to the place with a freezer in the back that always squeals. If you don\u2019t know where that is, ask a kid. They always know.\u201d I told them to bring water and a notebook and the names of their elders and the medications in their cabinets and their recipes for cheap food that tastes rich. I said, \u201cBring a neighbor you are not sure you like. This will be the hardest part and the most important.\u201d\n\nI said that the angels were not kings. I said that they would sing and show us where not to step, and we would take the steps. The crowd looked up and I held their looking by naming the looking. I told them that power would try to dress itself in their fear and we should be generous without being stupid. I said that we would count and we would measure because numbers make bridges when spoken softly. I said that we would be wrong and we would not settle there.\n\nWhen I said the word planets out loud, a ripple went through the square like wind passing over scythed wheat. The word made some people look beautiful; it made others look murderous. I told them that planets was not a pretty word today, it was a shopping list word. I told them we would send instruments first because we are a species that pokes with sticks before putting our arms in, and that is wisdom. I said that if we went we would not do it like thieves in a museum, palming artifacts. We would bring seeds and apology. We would bring our bad jokes. We would bring the recipes we learned from a grandmother who never measured anything and still always made it taste like a story. We would ask permission. We would write our names in pencil.\n\nA shoe flew. It was a loafer with a heel worn thin on one side, and it went end-over-end like a coin trying to pretend to be an idea. It hit the podium, not me, and the applause that followed was not applause, it was the sound people make when an object falls and does not kill. Tam moved before I did, a swift, precise reconfiguration of body and intent, and she did not move toward the man because she does not believe in being a wall when you can be a door. She found his eyes. He was already crying because anger, too, is a salve for fear until it isn\u2019t. I said into the wide open sky, \u201cKeep throwing shoes if you have to; we\u2019ve all worn something that didn\u2019t fit,\u201d and a laugh rose like steam. It wasn\u2019t pretty. It was necessary. The man\u2019s shoulders dropped. He put his hands in his pockets and pulled them out empty as if to confess he had been hoping they were full all along.\n\nAfter that the words came easier because the hardest thing had already happened and I had not died. I told them when, where, how to gather. I told them to take their money out of mattresses only as far as to buy a hand-crank radio and dried beans, and then put the money back if they had any left because the future we are not yet in still needs buses and show tickets and tips. I told them we were not closing but opening, like a hand, and that opening would hurt because we had used those fingers to hold onto ourselves for so long. I told them what we needed: translators who like puzzles, engineers whose first tool was a coat hanger, nurses who can start IVs in rolling ambulances, kids who are good at finding batteries in drawers. I said, \u201cIf your specialty is cooling temper tantrums in grocery store aisles, bring that. If your specialty is coaxing seeds that look like commas into basil like paragraphs, bring that. If your specialty is apologizing to people you don\u2019t want to apologize to and meaning it, bring that twice.\u201d\n\nThe angels hummed in a way that did not ask for acknowledgment and got it anyway. When I ended, there was no crescendo. There was a wave of bodies turning to talk to other bodies, which is what happens when humans hear something that fits. We make group work out of it. A teen somewhere shouted, \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d and the crowd moved without stampeding, a miracle I will not claim credit for. Holm grabbed my elbow with the grip of a person clinging to a rope, and Sana pressed a thermos into my hand, and Tam exhaled so hard I felt it cool the edge of my jaw.\n\nThe next room after the square was a room that smelled like toner and worry. Tables. Maps. The maps were already wrong because the river was thinking about a new shape for itself like a child thinking about telling a lie. Holm had people moving pushpins like prayers. Sana was already on the phone with a glacier in another time zone. The linguist, Dana, slid up with a sheaf of music paper she had stolen from a marching band closet. She had translated pieces of the songs the angels gave us into notation that looked like something you\u2019d play only if you wanted your instrument to develop opinions. Kieran rolled in a whiteboard and wrote on it with a marker that squealed until he apologized to it under his breath.\n\n\u201cWe can build a chamber,\u201d he said, to no one and everyone. \u201cNot a portal. An ear. A room that is a bell. We ring the song and see what listens. If the air presses or the temperature hums a notch sideways, if a smell no one remembers naming opens, we write that down. We don\u2019t put anybody in there. We don\u2019t put a bug in there. We put metal and math. I take that back; we put a leaf in there because leaves are brave.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn ear,\u201d Sana said, liking it. \u201cEars we can make. Ears we can build in basements if we have to. Ears don\u2019t require a vote from a budget committee. Ears become maps.\u201d\n\nVelez straightened imperceptibly, a geometry hearing a metaphor it could occupy. \u201cDo not make a mouth by accident,\u201d it said. \u201cDo not make a door that swings only one way. We will sing you away from that kind of hinge if you listen.\u201d\n\nHolm wrote HUBS on a whiteboard with a slash between the letters, as if making the word into a command. Underneath she wrote a list so plain it could have been a grocery list: Water. Food. Shade. Heat. Power, ankle height first. People who know the block. Wheelchairs. Insulin. Whistles. Tape. Pens that write upside down. Dignity, underlined twice even though she may have meant it as a joke. I watched people bring their own handwriting to the table, hats still on because they forgot about their heads in the face of a larger one.\n\nI made a rule nobody asked me to make and then realized it was the only way I could stand to be in this kind of room. I said, \u201cNo acronyms,\u201d and Holm laughed and then put a line through a string of letters she had been composing. \u201cWe will lose people at the second capital,\u201d I said. \u201cWe will keep the doors open if each word fits inside the mouth of a person who hates meetings.\u201d\n\nJun arrived with a backpack that looked like it had been packed by a person who understands the difference between a hypothetical and a hallway. He brought lemons and index cards and tape with the good pull. He hugged me as if he were handing me a rope. His eyes were tenderized meat. \u201cI made a form,\u201d he said, not embarrassed because shame was suddenly too expensive. \u201cNames. Skills. The thing you do without thinking when your phone dies. The tallest thing you can carry down three flights of stairs without stopping. The name of the neighbor you\u2019d call at two a.m. If they don\u2019t have one, we help them find one.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a monster,\u201d I said, because sometimes you honor genius with a joke.\n\nHe set up at a corner table and became a lighthouse; people came and he turned their fear into lines in a spreadsheet that breathed. He asked them questions like a barber or a bartender or a rabbi, which is to say kindly and with a hand on the shoulder at the exact right second. He made eye contact the way you hold a nail while you hammer it.\n\nWe built the first ear in a drained community pool that had chipped blue paint the color of longing. The pool had resisted becoming a skate park for years and now it got to be something larger. Volunteers taped plastic across the windows until the room felt like inside a throat. We built a frame of pipe and tension cable and hung sheets welded with mesh and a material Sana called meta, as if we could better reality by saying the word out loud. We hung resonant plates we stole from a piano that had been left out on the sidewalk in the weather and refused to die. We borrowed microphones from the city\u2019s least-bad cover band and a speaker stack that teenagers had previously used to annoy their parents and now was asked to annoy the gap between worlds.\n\nDana stood in the center with a pitch pipe and a laptop that had survived three majors. She ran a hand through short hair and made a face like she was about to taste something sour on purpose. The angels ringed the rafters like sentences that hadn\u2019t found their verbs. Velez made a small motion with its width that I had learned was yes in angel. People in orange volunteer vests whispered to each other the way people speak at wakes.\n\n\u201cOn three,\u201d Dana said, and then didn\u2019t count because real beginnings never do. She lifted the pitch and the sound was small and real and human, the way a whistle is, the way a kettle is, the way a mother calling a kid who is just out of sight is. She braided in the next note and the next, and the chords didn\u2019t sound like chords until your ribs remembered something from any time you had ever been held. The sheets in the frame shook without moving. The temperature did something you could have written in a notebook if your notebook had a column for this next weather.\n\nIt smelled like pennies and peach skin and wet bark, which made the hair on my arms stand up because sometimes repetition is proof and sometimes it is warning. The blue paint on the pool wall looked greener for a second and then remembered what it was. Kieran watched a needle climb a gauge and then laughed at a spot on the curve that made him see an old friend. He whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s a reply,\u201d and then covered his mouth as if it were blasphemy to be that glad.\n\nWe did not put anything alive in the ear. We soldered a loop of wire and clipped it to a ring soaked in sugar water and watched the water bead and then fall in a pattern none of us had the math for. We rusted pieces of steel that had asked for it for years. We left a square of silk and it came back smelling like a bread we didn\u2019t know how to bake. We wrote everything down in three separate notebooks in three different hands because redundancy is a kind of faith.\n\nLater, in the ten o\u2019clock meeting\u2014or maybe it was the two; time was a sliding window\u2014I said the words no angels, no armies, not because I believed either could be banned but because I needed to hear them said near each other so we could feel the current that would jump between. A man in a uniform bristling with rectangles of color stood and tried to make a rectangle of me. He said chain of command and I said command makes chains if you forget why you needed the chain in the first place. He said contingency operation and I said waterline. He said triage and I said kids. He looked at Tam like he was trying to find permission and she looked at his boots and did not give it. Holm refused to be the kind of politician who uses words like partnership when she means oversight; she said, \u201cWe\u2019ll need trucks, Major. Not speeches,\u201d and to his credit the man nodded and left his rhetoric on the chair and went to find keys.\n\nThe names began as a rumor. The angels, in their awkward kindness, had brought a list of people who could hold two truths at once without dropping either. The list was not a hierarchy, it was a constellation. One name was a woman who taught dance in a rec center and repaired zippers between classes. One was a man who ran an after-hours soup line out of a legally ambiguous kitchen. One was a librarian who could make a room quiet without being cruel. There were not leaders the way we expect them; they were conduits. They were markers in the old sense: things you put down so you don\u2019t lose the way. The angels called them witnesses but we called them what we could live with. We called and they said yes the way people say yes to carrying a crate they have not looked inside yet.\n\nNights got bad around three a.m. when the city\u2019s hums thinned and your own thoughts made larger sounds. The angels sang outside my window and once a neighbor shouted Shut up because grief is not polite. I made notes on a pad beside the bed and woke to sentences that looked like somebody else\u2019s handwriting. Jun fell asleep at the kitchen table twice and once we just covered him with a coat and wrote around him. Tam would leave and come back with paper and salty snacks and the kind of milk that never goes bad and face wash, because two and a half years is a long time to be without good soap. Sana started using new words: resonance window, dampening, braid integrity. Holm learned the names of the night-shift janitors at City Hall and said them aloud so often you would think she was incanting, and maybe she was.\n\nI went back to the course when I shouldn\u2019t have, the way you go back to a place that used to be only yours in order to make a small bargain with yourself. The putting green was a study in footprints, foreign weights pressed into the soft. The sign warning about aeration looked like it was trying to apologize for all of creation. In the pro shop the counter still had the little paper basket of cheap tees with bad jokes printed on them like embarrassment. Colin\u2019s mug had gone cold and then dried and then acquired a ring that made me think about time in a way that made me want to sit down. I took the shopping list he\u2019d left under the magnet\u2014cabbage, rice, paper towels, something crossed off I can\u2019t read\u2014and stuck it in my pocket not because I wanted a relic but because this was how I could carry him. An angel touched my cheek and I felt the exact tenderness of someone adjusting a collar before you walk into a room you\u2019d hoped to avoid.\n\n\u201cTell me a thing I cannot know until later,\u201d I said to Velez outside, and he laughed without cruelty.\n\n\u201cOn a night you will not expect,\u201d it said, \u201cthe stars will look like they are turning backward. That is a fold rehearsal. Stay inside even if you think that is cowardice. Your breath will feel like it wants to run away. Hold it softly. If you must sing, sing to quiet your bones, not the sky.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat else,\u201d I said, because greed is not only for food and money; it is for certainty too.\n\n\u201cShips,\u201d it said, dimming. \u201cDo not build them with corners that hunger for status. You will be tempted to paint names on the sides before you know if they float. Paint the word try. Then paint nothing. Then send the first ones empty if you can. Do not strap the poor to a rocket and call it salvation. Do not strap the rich either and call it justice.\u201d\n\nThat night a man with a blowout haircut got on a television and said my name like it had cut him and he wanted to make it bleed. He said golfer like it was a slur. In the comment flood that I didn\u2019t read but felt across my skin anyway, people put me in every painting and on every cereal box and under every headline like glue. Jun printed the memes and taped them to the wall because he believes in demystifying joke ghosts. Tam drew mustaches on the cruelest ones because she believes in defacement as balm. I threw a paper plane of myself down the hallway and watched it crash into a pile of blankets and felt better than was logical.\n\nWe opened the first hub in the gym with the scuffed lines and the clock that had not worked in years but still presided like a judge pretending retirement. Volunteers in vests that matched nothing handed out clipboards and crayons and water. A woman with a beautiful face that had been stern for too long showed up with a bag of mismatched socks and became the sock person, which was not her destiny but it was her day. A boy crawled under the bleachers and came out with a kitten and a handful of broken wishes he blew at me like confetti. An old man stood at a corner table and sharpened pencils with a pocket knife, shavings like curled paper rain. A girl explained to her grandmother that the angels were not ghosts because ghosts do not smell like rain on pennies. A crew that had been a youth basketball team before their coach fell asleep sitting up made sandwiches with mustard like a deadline.\n\nThe Major came back with trucks and the stiff posture that says being told to help has injured something tender. Tam handed him a stack of clipboards without ceremony while Holm told him which door to guard and which to wedge open with a piece of wood because the wedge was missing. Sana set up a station for insulin like she had been born knowing where to put coolers so they don\u2019t trip anyone. Dana sat with a group of kids and showed them how to write the song shapes with crayons, not because they needed to but because doing a thing you can do with your hands near a thing you cannot do with your hands is medicine. The priest put a basket by the door and wrote on it in black marker FOR PHONES WHILE YOU CRY and people used it and nobody stole any and that made me believe in something I do not like to name.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clean. It wasn\u2019t orderly. It was a kind of music anyway. I stood on the stage and did not speak because the room did not need me to tell it what it was. A woman came up with a notebook already full because she is the sort of person who has been making hubs in her building since forever. She wanted a stamp. She wanted a version of official. I drew a small circle on her page with a smile inside it and she nodded and we both pretended it was a badge so we could keep walking.\n\nLate, after the chairs had been stacked by teenagers with energy like sparks, after the floors had been swept with push brooms that left a whisper trail, after someone had taken the leftover sandwiches and listed who they would go to and how to get them there without waking babies, I walked home with Tam and Jun. The city had the softness of a person who has been crying for a while and is now making tea. We passed a man playing a violin under a bridge who had tuned it to the angel hum and was making money hand over fist which he put meticulously into a pocket and then took out and handed to a woman with a sign that said SHEEPISHLY: RENT. We passed a building that had a light on in one window and nothing in the room but two chairs and a plant and two people telling the truth to each other in a way you could feel through brick.\n\nJun dropped a lemon and it rolled into the curb and he chased it and then stopped and looked at me and we laughed in that exhausted way that feels like a relief valve opening on a factory you used to hate but now requires because it keeps the lights on. Velez hovered near the streetlight like an extra bulb. I wanted to ask it to go away and I wanted it to stay and I told it neither thing because choosing is exhausting and I have learned to save that muscle for when I need it.\n\nAt home, my table wasn\u2019t big enough for the important papers now, so we put important papers on the floor and on the bed and under the plant and on the windowsill and in the sink for a minute while I washed my hands very thoroughly because my mother\u2019s ghost still believes in soap. I wrote Hello. I am a person. We have a plan again on a pad because sometimes handwriting your own script into yourself is the only way to allow that your mouth said the thing. This time the period at the end looked heavier, as if gravity had upped its insistence by one small notch we could withstand so long as we didn\u2019t pretend we couldn\u2019t feel it.\n\nThe thunder that came was not storm but infrastructure, a construction sound from outside the city where they were building a temporary bridge over a piece of river that had gotten ideas. It sounded like paper folded with purpose. It sounded like a boat being born from flat. It sounded like something we were going to ask people we love to step into, hand in hand, without knowing where the shoreline was going to present itself on the other side. I poured water into glasses and handed them to my people and put my own glass down too close to a map and smeared a line and then apologized to the map out loud because I have turned into that kind of person. We slept in shifts with the angels three degrees off our windows and the city breathing through its teeth and the clock over the gym being wrong on purpose as a kindness to us all.Chapter 5\n\nThe night the sky practiced breaking, the city learned to hold still. It wasn\u2019t even a night in the calendar sense; it was one of those in-between hours with day still clinging to the edges, enough light in the west that the pigeons hadn\u2019t given up yet. We were in the gym hub taking stock of things with labels, and then all at once every conversation leaned the same way because something at the top of us had turned its head. People went outside in clumps\u2014curiosity is a herd animal\u2014and then froze in doorways when the stars did the thing they do in bad renderings, the wrongness inserted on purpose so you\u2019ll notice. They slid, not quickly but wrong-speed, like a clock hand being pushed by a child. A man said aloud to an empty patch of bleachers, \u201cThat\u2019s not possible,\u201d and then sat down and put his head in his hands before the sentence finished. Someone laughed because that is what fear does when backed into a corner. A woman clapped her hands once like she was calling a dog, and then covered her mouth as if she had woken something.\n\nWe had told them to stay inside if the sky paraded. We had told them the parade was not for us. We had taped notes to the doors like you tape a reminder to a fridge: three lines in black marker, the ink bleeding a little because the paper was cheap. Stay inside. Breathe so your bones hear. Sing if you must. People read it and then read it again and then did not believe it until belief was easier than standing exposed with your hair lifted by a wind you couldn\u2019t find. Tam put her palm at the back of my ribs where the breath gets stuck and counted, one-two-three-four, her voice so steady it made me feel like I was in a boat that did not know the word capsize. Jun\u2019s spreadsheet got forgotten for ten minutes, which is a catastrophe in his world, and he stood staring at nothing except everything, then blinked hard and went around closing windows because sometimes the best thing you can do for a city is become the person who closes things that were opened too far.\n\nThe sound, when it came, did not come through ears. Velez had said bones and I had assumed he meant it metaphorically, but bones have ownphones we\u2019ve just never been made to answer before. It was a tone like someone dragging a finger around a wineglass that had been growing at the same temperature as the ocean. It said, Hold. It said, Stay. It said, You are not fragile but you are not in charge. The worst of us went outside to point guns at the sky because ritual is hard to quit. The best of us put hands on knees and remembered how to persuade the body to continue. A kid under the bleachers started humming and then someone hummed with him and then the whole left side of the gym was a chorus, low and ridiculous and perfect, the way people singing always is when they\u2019re not performing for money.\n\nWhen it passed, it didn\u2019t. It changed shape and weight and slid into a different room of the body. We crept to windows and decided not to look straight up yet, the way you get out of bed and do a lap of the hallway before confronting a mirror after you\u2019ve cried. The stars remembered themselves in a rush, as if embarrassed, and people began to talk like air being let out of something. Someone made a joke about retrograde and the astrologer in the corner rolled her eyes in a way that told me she would tell a better joke later when she had her breath back. I found Velez by not looking for it and felt it like the pressure at the back of a closed door. It made the little motion that means yes without showing off, which is a skill angels are only now learning.\n\n\u201cRehearsal,\u201d it said, arranging light like somebody smoothing a collar. \u201cNot for you. For the fold. It is learning its bad manners.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said to sing to our bones, not the sky,\u201d I said, and my voice sounded like something that needed oil. \u201cWe sounded ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sounded correct,\u201d it said. \u201cRidiculous is a kind of correct that keeps you alive.\u201d\n\nOut in the square beyond the gym, a man shouted that this was a sign of salvation and tried to sell candles at a markup. Holm walked over with a look on her face like, Of course, and bought every candle and then handed them out for free and called him honey when he sputtered. Sana sat on the floor with her back against the wall and wrote three pages of notes about what instruments she didn\u2019t have that she wished she did and then circled the words cheap accelerometer twice. Kieran ran outside and spun slowly while staring, then swayed and sat down and said, \u201cOkay then,\u201d to the concrete. Dana covered her ears and took them off and covered them again and I loved her for the honesty of indecision.\n\nBy midnight the city was tired of pretending it could make the sky behave through observation alone. People went home, or to new homes built inside the bones of old schools, and cooked noodles on hot plates and told stories of former nights that had felt like the end just to make this one feel like part of a parade float of endings instead of a knife point. I slept early for six minutes and dreamed that my driver had grown hair and was humming in my bag. Tam shook me awake softly and handed me a sandwich that had so much mustard on it it felt honest. Velez hummed outside a window the way a bee will hover a second too long to be polite, and then dimmed so we could all pretend we were only a building with a gym in it, not a lung with a city wrapped around it.\n\nIn the morning the news tried to name the thing that had happened and failed three times and then settled on a word that meant nothing and felt safe in the mouth, and I forgave them because making language was a bucket and at least they were carrying. The pundit with the hurricane haircut said my name like it had a handle he could turn and asked whether women who hit balls for a living were qualified to advise on geophysics, and then a woman from the earthquake office with a face like a cup of coffee answered, \u201cYes,\u201d without looking up because she was busy making a list of buildings that needed their spines checked. The internet divided into jokes about retrograde and diagrams amplified until they turned to chalk dust. The angels did not explain. They went in groups to nursing homes and sat outside windows and made the kind of light that doesn\u2019t ask for thank you.\n\nThe ears gave us a reply that afternoon and we were not ready for it because we had told ourselves that answers only come when you\u2019re holding instruments properly. The drained pool had become our favorite mistake; it read as silly to anyone who believed that science wore only clean coats. The teenagers who had spray painted their names inside it years ago now stood on the deck pressing their hands into their pockets and watching like they\u2019d been asked to babysit a very expensive toddler. We began humming the song we\u2019d been given for Place One, which we had not named yet because names make false ownerships, and the room did its temperature trick and then something smaller and meaner: a metallic smell like coins between teeth, and then a curl of scent over that like resin or the first cut you make into a sap-bleeding tree.\n\nKieran had set up a grid of sensor plates and sugar water loops and a piece of silk over a ring like a cheap toy magic trick. A bead formed on the silk that was not condensation in the usual sense because the temperature in the room did not support it and there was no source we could point to with a finger that would satisfy a teacher. The bead fell, and I knew when it hit the plate that we had to slow time as much as possible without becoming statues. Sana moved like a chess piece and I watched gratitude become a weapon in her hand. She scooped the drop with a glass tip and set it into a vial and labeled it with her handwriting that looked like someone had taught her to write in the middle of a chase scene. She handed the vial to a kid who was suddenly a courier in a movie and he ran as if the hallway were a track with both ends on fire.\n\nWe had promised ourselves and each other that we would not breathe anything we didn\u2019t understand just because it used the shape of our longing. We had the fume hood and the sterilizer that smelled faintly like hospitals and grandparents. The first test Sana did was so simple I wanted to kiss her: she warmed the droplet near a clean wire and watched whether the smoke went up or refused to be smoke. It went up, which meant we\u2019d stayed in our own air. No alien pathogens, at least not on the part of our chart where we could make notes. She did three more things with the same slow hands and then looked up and smiled in a way that told me a big thing: someone had stood at a cliff and not fallen and she had witnessed it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s resin-ish,\u201d she said, finding a word that wasn\u2019t in any categorized smell list. \u201cLow salt. Trace something that reads as pine if pine had been taught a new trick. Something that hums like chalk when you scratch a plate but for noses.\u201d She stopped and huffed at herself and I loved her for her attempts to make poetry serve data because the reverse had been happening to us all week and it was only fair. \u201cThere\u2019s oxygen in the way we like it in our lungs, but that could be bias. It\u2019s like we told the air a story about what we wanted and it nodded halfway.\u201d\n\n\u201cLake,\u201d I said without meaning to, and then I was embarrassed because it felt like I was naming a baby at a grocery store by pointing at whatever I could see. \u201cI mean the summer smell where for an hour the mosquitoes forget to exist. I mean that. It\u2019s in there.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in there,\u201d Dana said, and she didn\u2019t look up from her chart where she had made new symbols because the old ones had run out. \u201cThis is the part where we argue about who gets to choose the word, and then we decide no one gets to choose the word until we find the place with our feet, if we ever do. Until then we call it by numbers and songs and something we can\u2019t ruin with our ownership.\u201d\n\nThe teenagers started calling it Blue Two because the paint had once been blue and the second vial had been slightly darker, and I felt dizzy with relief at being spared a myth for five minutes. We put the vial in a cooler as if it were human and carried it to a place where it could get translated into numbers that would make Kieran exhale like a relieved window. The angels watched without comment in their way that is not detached so much as protective of our right to pretend we had thought of it all. Velez leaned toward me until my hair lifted and said a thing that rang true and annoyed me: \u201cYou will get addicted to small good news,\u201d it said. \u201cRation it like sugar. It makes the rest possible but it will rot your optimism if you chug.\u201d\n\nThe Major came back with new shoulders. He had taken off the jacket that advertised his rank and put on one that just said his name, ARROYO stitched small and almost not there. He brought trucks and people who had spent their lives wanting to be given tasks they could complete with their hands and timelines. He found me making a list with bad pen on worse paper and waited awkwardly to be told he could speak, even though I had never once asked him to wait to speak. \u201cMy kid,\u201d he said, and he did not add a verb, which is how you know a man is not practicing. \u201cShe came to the hub last night because she was with her mom and they thought it was just\u2026 a warming station. She slept on a yoga mat and woke up when the sky\u2014\u201d and he moved one hand in a circle that meant the word none of us had. \u201cShe said a woman sang and it made her chest stop hurting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat woman is fourteen,\u201d I said because we had the list of who hummed and when because we write everything down when we think we might forget later that we were brave. \u201cWe\u2019re feeding her pancakes for the rest of her life.\u201d\n\nHe nodded and did the thing where a man wipes his eye like he\u2019s adjusting his face. \u201cTell me what to guard and what to ignore,\u201d he said, and the humility in it broke something tender in me that I hadn\u2019t realized I was armoring. \u201cI have people good at doors. They need better doors.\u201d\n\n\u201cGuard the ear rooms,\u201d I said. \u201cGuard the insulin without making people feel like you\u2019ll shoot them to protect their medicine; stand there like an uncle. Ignore the people selling candles until they sell knives with the candles. And if anyone says the words body count, put them in a corner like a toddler and don\u2019t let them talk in public until they remember how to say people.\u201d\n\n\u201cCopy,\u201d he said, and meant it in the radio way, which was fine because every language gets to borrow. \u201cAnd about the team from the\u2014\u201d He stopped and smiled at himself. \u201cAbout the guys in suits who want to requisition your hubs for continuity of government. They\u2019re in the lobby. They don\u2019t like my face when I am polite.\u201d\n\nHolm appeared like the manifestation of his sentence with her hair doing the thing it does when hats have been asked of it and refused. She had a stack of forms that said REQUEST on the top and a pen that had given up three times and had teeth marks that looked new. \u201cWe have to work with them,\u201d she said, and we all made faces because adults rarely get to be purely righteous. \u201cBut they don\u2019t get to rename what we already built. No acronyms,\u201d she added, and it and I laughed because I love a rule that propagates in the wild.\n\nWe went to the lobby and shook hands with men who wore their watches heavy and their shoes quiet. They used the word theater like an accusation and I used the word staging like a bridge and after ten minutes we all agreed that there would be a table in the corner where someone from their world could sit and take notes and be useful without owning the furniture. They wanted to know how we would keep order if people didn\u2019t listen, and I said, \u201cWe will listen first,\u201d and they blinked like someone had thrown cold water in their faces. One of them tried to hand me a binder with tabs that said things like FOOD AUTHORITY and INCIDENT ESCALATION, and I took it from him because refusing a binder is bad optics when cameras are near, and then handed it to Jun without looking and Jun put it under a potted plant and smiled sweetly until the camera left.\n\nThe mouth almost happened and then didn\u2019t, and the part of me that believes in luck as a species of genius will put that day on a small shelf forever. We had said ear so often that we thought we were safe from our own hunger to pry, but metaphors are slippery. A private lab out by the beltway, a building with mirrored glass that made it look like it wanted to spy on itself, started vibrating on someone else\u2019s channel. An engineer who loved machines more than rules had built a chamber that did two things at once and he was so proud he wanted to be forgiven in advance. The song had bent in their room, and then there had been a moment of thinned air like the breath you hold when you pass someone crying on a bus, and then a smell that wanted to be called meat. A tech with a hair tie around her wrist had texted a friend at a hub while her boss went to find a tie; the friend texted a friend; the friend texted Holm; Holm texted me; I texted Velez even though that is not how it works and the reply was a light at the edge of my vision that made me step backward without deciding to.\n\nWe went in a van because sometimes the future still arrives in vans that smell faintly of French fries. Arroyo brought two of his door people, who had door eyes but hearts not yet crushed by door work. Holm wore a blazer like armor and flats like a concession. Sana brought the tone generator in its padded case, which looked like a violin and felt just as sensitive to insult. Tam drove because she trusts only her hands when urgency is in the car. We didn\u2019t have a warrant of any kind and also this is not a story where warrants matter; we had the arrogance of being right and the backup of languages we could switch to mid-hallway to confuse a man with a lanyard.\n\nThe building\u2019s guard looked like a person who had once believed in rules and now believed in shift change. He tried to tell us to stop and Holm said, \u201cMinister,\u201d and didn\u2019t flash a badge because we hadn\u2019t made those yet, and he stepped aside because people love titles even as they claim not to. Inside we could hear a hum that wasn\u2019t on any of our lists of okay hums. The chamber had been welded from steel that had wanted to be a boat twenty years ago, and it sat in a room with too many wires and too little sense. A man with eyes like a raccoon on day four of a thesis defense tried to convince us we were lucky to witness his first success, and Sana said, in the quiet voice that breaks arrogance quicker than shouting, \u201cTurn it off or we leave and take out your breakers.\u201d\n\nThe tech with the hair tie looked at me and made teeny finger gestures that meant, Please be the adult in the room that I can\u2019t afford to be, and I felt my heart put on a uniform I had not issued, which is something hearts do when told they are in charge. \u201cYou are building a mouth,\u201d I said. \u201cYou are building a door with a bias. You are calling it a window so you can sleep. Turn it off.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are on a deadline,\u201d he said, which is the scariest sentence a scientist can say to me now.\n\n\u201cSo is the Earth,\u201d Tam said, and I loved her for the way she can throw a sentence like a brick into a stack of red cups. \u201cNobody is trying to beat the apocalypse to the finish line by cheating on a test.\u201d\n\nSana stepped in and laid a hand on the tone generator case like a parent resting a hand on a sleeping child. \u201cWe will give you an ear,\u201d she said, and the man flinched at the word choice because ears imply listening equals humility. \u201cYou can have sensor time. You can have math. You cannot have a mouth yet. You cannot build a hinge that only swings one way and hope the air doesn\u2019t notice.\u201d\n\nArroyo had already begun unplugging things with the skill of a man who understands that electricity is a kind of badly behaved river. He pulled a cord gently and then another, and the hum dimmed a shade and I could feel my teeth uncurl. Velez glowed so bright in the corner that the tech muttered whoa without meaning to, and then put both hands on the table like she was steadying a patient. The raccoon-eyed man put his face in his hands and did not say sorry, which was fair because he was not sorry; he was thwarted. I recognized the feeling and despised it and offered him a job he didn\u2019t want yet in three weeks when he would come looking because this is how you steal brilliance back from hunger.\n\nAfter, in the van, Holm laughed so hard it scared me, and then she cried in one breath like a faucet with a weight on the handle, and then she said, \u201cWe need a pipeline for whistleblowers that isn\u2019t just teenagers texting their cousins,\u201d and Jun, who had come because he can sense when a spreadsheet is going to need a new column, wrote the word WHISTLES in all caps on the top of a page and then softer beside it wrote the words cookies and parking validation because he is the only person in the city who understands that justice requires snacks and a place to put your car without being ticketed.\n\nWe named the first place accidentally, which I should have expected given that all the best names are like that. The vial had a label in Sana\u2019s hand and a smudge from my thumb where I\u2019d been careless, and the smudge made a streak that looked like a small mountain seen from far away on a map drawn by a child. Dana pointed at it and said, \u201cRidge,\u201d and then shook her head because she didn\u2019t want to be the one to say it first. Arroyo said, \u201cTone,\u201d because he was reading the graph Kieran had printed and taped badly to a wall. Jun, without looking, said, \u201cRidgetone,\u201d and the room said it back to itself and then frowned because it was ugly and therefore likely to stick. We decided to call it that and not in public, to give ourselves a place to stand that the internet didn\u2019t own. The teenagers hated it and started a poll to rename it Lakeward, which was better and worse, and I shrugged because fighting over a nickname is how you get people to show up to a meeting they didn\u2019t want to go to.\n\nI went back to the course because there are only so many hours you can ask a body to hold responsibility without giving it a familiar ritual to wash its hands in. It was not my day, it was no one\u2019s day, and still the fairways had people scattered the way a small town scatters at a fair. They were not swinging clubs and the sight of that made me exhale in a way I could trust. They were walking the lines we had all walked before when none of this had happened and saying to each other, \u201cThis is where she sliced once,\u201d and \u201cThis is the stupid bunker that ate her,\u201d and \u201cThis is where I dropped my keys and found them because a stranger had noticed,\u201d which is a ritual and a kindness in equal measure. The bunker on seventeen still sat like an old idea that used to be fun. The angels were further out that day, hovering above the treeline like a punctuation mark waiting for a sentence to earn it.\n\nColin\u2019s shopping list was in my pocket and I took it out and read it again because there is a certain holiness in inventory. Cabbage. Rice. Paper towels. Something crossed off that might be onions or might be a debt. I walked to the corner store and bought the items and then walked back to the course and left the bag on the counter of the pro shop where his mug was not, where his name was not, where the new kid behind the counter with a face like a second chance looked at the bag and then at me and said, \u201cWhat is this,\u201d and I said, \u201cThis is me doing a very small thing for a person who is very not here,\u201d and he nodded like a man who has been given a blessing he didn\u2019t request and will honor anyway.\n\nHolm started sleeping on a cot in her office, not because she wanted to make a martyr out of her spine but because there was no other place to put the maps. Tam kept a list of who had gone home and who had not, and once I saw her add my name to the second column and cross it out and add it again and then draw a heart around it like a teenager, and I had to go into a stairwell and let my face do a thing that wouldn\u2019t survive fluorescent light. Sana began collecting broken instruments\u2014violins with hair missing, trumpets with stuck valves, a bass drum that had been kicked by a marching band with poor impulse control\u2014and putting them in the ear rooms not to play but to listen, because she believed and made me believe that metal and wood remember things we don\u2019t and might show us how not to be rude to physics. Dana learned how to sleep sitting up without falling over. Kieran started calling his mother more often and once I answered his phone because his hands were inside a wire harness and talked to a woman who said, \u201cHe was there when the creek flooded and he was eight and he made a dam out of sticks that held for an hour, did he tell you,\u201d and I said, \u201cHe will,\u201d and she said, \u201cHe will not,\u201d and we hung up both satisfied.\n\nPeople asked me to go to their meetings and I learned quickly how to be two in a day before noon. A group in a church basement with coffee in urns and a smell like old books wanted to talk about what the beginning of leaving would look like because the leaving was a rumor nobody trusted and an obligation everybody dreaded. A group in a park wanted to be told they were vital and were, which is always a relief to be able to say honestly. A group in a warehouse wanted permission to build little things that look like boats out of truck tires and faith, and I said yes because they were not putting people in them, they were putting hope in them and rolling it around to see if it leaked. A group in a rich living room wanted to donate without having to come to the hub and I told them where to send money and then told them to show up anyway and bus tables with their soft hands for three hours because money is important and so is the sound a rich person makes when they realize the bread smells the same no matter who slices it.\n\nThe blowout hair man got a crowd to chant my name like an extinction event and I found the clip by accident when a volunteer\u2019s phone fell on play. He said things about expertise that would have made sense to me when I was twenty-two and still believed we should only be led by people with laminated cards, and then he said something that made the room behind my ribs go cold in a new way: he talked about triage like it was a sport. He wanted ships for the loyal and ships for the skilled and ships for the \u201cclean,\u201d and I said the word out loud in my kitchen and my rubber plant leaned away like even it could not stand that sound. Jun printed the transcript and marked through the words that would hurt us if they stuck, and wrote in the margin, We do not triage people. We triage tasks, and I kissed the top of his head when he wasn\u2019t looking because if I had said the words out loud I would have made a speech and we were on a speech diet.\n\nWe wrote the code on a wall near the door to the gym with a marker that had seen too much. It was not a code like encryption; it was a code like a recipe. No mouths. No acronyms. No kings. Lists when needed. Stories when needed. Buckets always. We added a line that Dana insisted on and Sana seconded: Data belongs to the neighborhood first. It got messy immediately because neighborhoods are messy and data is greedy and I have made peace with the fact that most rules are just temporary walls to lean on while you tie your shoe. We added another line in a different hand because the wall was not our paper; it was ours: If a door opens one way, we walk away. If a door opens two ways, we put a person in it never, and a leaf first, and then a machine, and then possibly a rumor, and then maybe a person when we have learned the rumor by heart.\n\nOn a Thursday at a time that would once have been traffic and now was just motion, a bus driver named Lo brought two dozen people from the far side of the river to the hub because their church had burst with volunteers and they needed to overflow. She had a tattoo of an anchor on her wrist and the laugh of a person who had been told a fine and had paid it and had not cried in public once. She had a binder full of names and allergies and the number of a guy who had access to a freezer truck, and I looked at her and said the quiet part out loud, \u201cYou are on the list,\u201d and she said, \u201cWhat list,\u201d because this is the kind of person she is. I told her about the witnesses and she swore and then said, \u201cFine,\u201d because humility is a door and she knows which way to push.\n\nWe took the first instruments to the bridge the city was building in the wrong place because we didn\u2019t have the right place yet. Engineers who had learned to be poets that week set up transponders that were not weapons on a span that was not done. They tilted panels to listen to the song in a way that made me feel like a father in a movie teaching a child to shave. The angels hovered out over the water and did not touch it because they were learning to make the hard choice not to be useful in ways that make us lazy. A woman from the chorus in the old church with the cracked nave stood and sang a phrase into the wind and the wind brought the sound back to her with an extra weight like it had picked up a coin. A boy balanced on the rail with frogs in his pockets and looked like a person I would have followed up a mountain. The song made a shadow on the water like a map you could only read if you could hold your breath.\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d Velez said, because it had learned the rhythm of my questions, and I did not pretend I hadn\u2019t asked.\n\nAt home that night Tam tried to teach me to sleep again. She put on a bad murder show that we had seen twice before and it worked for a quarter of an hour until someone said alibi like a poem, and then I sat up because the word backwards meant something about the fold and I couldn\u2019t stand that my brain was now a spigot that never turned off. She put her hand on my chest and I performed breathing. We talked about a thing that wasn\u2019t this for three whole minutes, which was as close to a vacation as we are allotted in this epoch. I told her a story about a tournament where the bathroom on the front nine had been haunted by a tampon dispenser that made a sound like a failing airplane and she laughed until she couldn\u2019t breathe just right and then we both breathed right to fix it. She admitted, in a voice like someone confessing they don\u2019t brush their teeth at night sometimes, that she had once almost become a chef before becoming a person who can carry someone else\u2019s clubs as if they were heart valves. I promised her a kitchen on the other side of whatever this is that could hold heat like a secret, and she promised me a corner that is only mine in every room we ever build for anyone, and I went to sleep with my hand on her hip and woke up that way, which is the kind of grace I mean when I pretend not to believe in it.\n\nThere was a night when the angels sang without being asked and I knew before the window went pale that they were singing apology. They had found a group upstate building a mouth on purpose and lied about it, not the angels but the people, and the angles had sharpened in the room and a mouse had run out with hair on end and a child had had a nosebleed out of nowhere and an old man had forgotten his name for ten seconds and we did not get a call until after because people hide their worst tries until they crash. We drove again and this time the drive was silent in the van in the way that means everyone is managing their anger like a pan with a lid that does not fit. We turned off the thing that should not have been turned on and I said, because I had to say it to believe it could be said, \u201cNo,\u201d and the room held the word like a small animal that would bite if startled. A woman yelled that we were killing her children because she had believed that she could put them in a door and they would be saved thirty seconds before the rest of us. I wanted to yell back because she had said the ugly part out loud, but instead I asked her the names of her children and wrote them down in my book and she watched me write them like she was deciding if she would let me. We gave her bus tickets and a schedule and protein bars and she left crying and I stood for five minutes staring at my own handwriting and thinking, This is one way the world ends, not with pride or a bang but with a good person caught by a bad hinge.\n\nIf you are waiting for the part where we launch a ship you have to wait longer, because ships are for later and we were still becoming the kind of people who could build one. We learned to build ears in six cities and a village that had never had a coffee shop but had always had a way of finding lost dogs. We learned the song of a second place and a third and they were nothing like the first, one with a sourness that read as metal trying to be soil, one with a sweetness that felt like a bag of rotten fruit left in a car. We learned which songs made the sugar water shiver and which made it cry. We failed to translate spectrum into hunger and had to settle for making graphs we could point at with a pencil and say, \u201cHere is where it turns its head.\u201d We bought a secondhand freezer at a police auction and took the bullets out of its story and put vials inside it and promised not to live or die by the contents.\n\nA woman in a lab in a country three time zones away that had taught me the word jacaranda when I didn\u2019t know it yet wrote to us with a diagram we had not asked for and a joke in the subject line and a grievance in the postscript about our refusal to make acronyms, and I wrote back and asked how her wife was taking her eating schedule, and she wrote back a paragraph about soup that made me want to get on a plane that did not exist anymore. A boy in a town I had never been to sent me a photo of a chalkboard with a plan on it that was so clear it made me jealous and then delighted, and I printed it and taped it to the wall by the plant and the plant leaned toward it like a reader.\n\nWe found out, because the world cannot resist showing its bruises to a camera, that there were camps forming in places where men with new flags had decided their words would be the last ones. They said Family and meant Border. They said Order and meant Fear. They said Ship and meant Ark and I went very still because I had hoped the old metaphors had rotted in storage. We sent people to set up hubs across the street from the camps and fed people their own names and asked them if they wanted to hold a clipboard or a child and listened to their answers like we might learn how to make chairs that did not splinter under weight. The angels hovered above the camps and did not sing, which is the only way to be honest around certain kinds of theater.\n\nOn a morning with cloud cover like a lid, the air over the river did a thing that made me believe in practice like a religion. The song we called Ridgetone echoed back at us with a new harmonic we had not taught it and that meant we had learned something without being given permission. I stood on the bridge that was still pretending to be a bridge and put my hands on the rail and felt the vibration move through metal that had once been ore in a mountain and now was a road and thought, If we deserve another place, it will be because of this feeling, the one that starts in the palm and moves into the chest and becomes the desire to make a thing quiet through competent motion. Velez hovered alongside at shoulder height and did not speak and I did not either because sometimes the leadership is in refusing to narrate.\n\nWe wrote new words on the wall that day because the old ones had found their uses and we needed more. We added: Ask permission even if you don\u2019t know who to ask. We added: Seeds are also apologies. We added: No lotteries until we make sure the bowl isn\u2019t full of only spoons. We added: The person who hates meetings the most gets to run the first ten. And, in smaller print because we were embarrassed to be sentimental in public, we wrote: Keep each other\u2019s jackets flat.\n\nThe next rehearsal came two days later and it was worse and easier because we were different. The stars turned their wrong way and we sat and hummed and some people outside hummed louder and some sat very still and held hands with a stranger like a lifeline and the sky pretended it was not a participant. Someone tried again to sell candles and Arroyo bought them all and this time he lit one and put it on the steps and we all sat for two minutes and pretended to pray and I learned a new thing: sometimes pretending is the only way to open the real. After, a man looked at me and said, \u201cI changed my mind about you,\u201d and I said, \u201cI know,\u201d without being unkind, and he laughed like a rock being thrown into a river and apologized to the water for the splash.\n\nWhen I finally took a day off it wasn\u2019t one. I made pancakes at my place and burned three and ate them anyway because the day had been about charity and I wanted to be consistent. Jun came over with a paper bag of lemons and a dozen index cards with the word Quieter written on them because he had taken it upon himself to rename the days that used to be Saturday. Tam wore socks that did not match on purpose and lay on my couch like a person performing rest. The rubber plant had decided to become an extrovert and we applauded it quietly. Velez hovered outside like a good boundary and hummed once when the kettle boiled, which is the kind of friendship I can tolerate with the divine.\n\nWe didn\u2019t talk about ships because if we had the day would have turned its face toward duty. We talked about the smell the ear had brought us and how it had changed our relationship to the word pine and whether we were allowed to hope that somewhere there is a tree that would not be offended by our leaning. We talked about the shoe that had hit the podium and whether we could turn that story into a warning or whether it had to stay exactly what it was: a thing that happened in a square during a speech and was resolved by laughter and a man putting his pockets inside-out. We talked about my mother and her sandwiches and how she would have wrapped every one of your names in wax paper and sent them with you and I cried and then laughed because crying is a version of cleaning and I was overdue.\n\nWhen the phone rang it was a number without area code because those had stopped mattering. A voice I didn\u2019t know said, \u201cWe found a song you didn\u2019t give us,\u201d and my stomach did the thing stomachs do when you are about to learn something you did not schedule. It was a farm in a state I had never wanted to visit and now suddenly would, a place where people had their own language for the wind and their own gossip about the soil. They had been playing the radio near the goats and the angels had translated the goats into another frequency because apparently you can become a conduit by accident while chewing. The song did a thing we did not expect and a thing that we had feared: it echoed inside a silo until the silo remembered it was meant to be a bell. The old farmer said, \u201cMy wife heard it and smiled without her dentures in,\u201d and I said, \u201cWe\u2019re on our way,\u201d because this is how you run a world near the edge: you remind it it still knows how to make bells, even out of things it had repurposed as storage for grain.\n\nWe drove with the windows open because the van had acquired a smell like too many meetings and I needed to remember that air could be different. The road was the kind of road that turns into stories without asking. The sky did not rehearse for us that day; it minded its manners, which made me suspicious and grateful in equal measure. We passed a billboard that had been repainted to say BE NICE in letters that looked like they had been trying to be a cow and given up, and a kid on a bike shouted we\u2019re practicing at us and I shouted back what and he shouted being neighbors and my stupid eyes filled. Tam stuck her head out the window like a dog and yelled who taught you to be so good and the kid shrugged and kept riding because it is not a mystery; people always know until they forget.\n\nOn the farm the silo did ring when asked, a deep-bell sound like a hand under a chair. The goats looked at us like we were being dramatic and went on chewing. The farmer asked me to sign his wife\u2019s apron as if I were famous and I scrawled my name as if it meant something and then drew the small circle with a smile inside it because this was as close to a badge as she would ever want. We set up our plates and our silk and our sugar and sang the goat-translated song and the air did not change and then did, as if it were embarrassed to be caught doing a trick. The smell was not pine this time but something I could not name and later would: a resin that had been taught sadness. Dana wrote the new symbols and Kieran pressed his ear to the metal and tried to get it to talk back and it did not but it did hum, which is as rude as it is promising. Sana took the vial and looked at me and we both laughed for no reason I can tell you except that sometimes the body releases.\n\nOn the drive back, we passed a group of kids building ears out of hula hoops and old sheets and their parents watched from porches with expressions that had hope in them in a way that made me worry about the weight of our luck. Velez did not follow; it had gone to sit on a water tower and learn from rust. The radio tried to give me my own voice back through a speaker and I turned it down because I am not a person who learns from hearing herself on delay. Tam sang a stupid song about lemons to make me remember that the world remembers how to be stupid, and I leaned my head against the window and watched the trees go by and thought, not for the first time, about the word after. It had started to feel like a room that could have furniture instead of a cliff.\n\nThat night, around three, the city did the thing where it breathes in the middle of the night as if it is counting itself, and I dreamed of a green that was not grass but something new that would take my weight. I stood at the edge of a long fairway that had never needed mowing, and the flag was a flying thing that had decided to pretend to be a flag for the afternoon. I swung my driver and the sound it made was the song of a planet we had not named and I woke with my hand in the air as if to apologize to the ceiling for the noise. In the morning Jun put a new word on the wall under all the other rules. He wrote: Practice joy, and I rolled my eyes and kissed his cheek and we went to work.Chapter 7\n\nThe first time a building creased and then uncreased itself, we happened to be there by accident and also because all accidents now felt like the world repurposing our schedules. It was the train station that had been stranded since the line was cut years ago, a vaulted room with a clock face that lied one honest lie forever. We chose it for a Witnesses\u2019 circle because it was neutral ground and because its benches remembered holding grief without curating it. We had dragged folding chairs that pinched fingers if you forgot which hinge was treacherous. Someone had laid out a table of cut oranges and cups that tasted like they had been clean and then stored near a broom. The angels perched in the high windows like a rumor the pigeons had stopped believing in. I had asked everyone to bring the object they reach for when they\u2019re solving something, and so we had a pile on the floor: a whisk, a multimeter, a seam ripper, a battered pocket atlas, a spool of mason\u2019s line, a dog-eared zine about breaker boxes, a needle-nose plier, a Sharpie that had survived three administrations, a coil of tape white as bone. We were telling stories of doors we had refused to be, of rules we had made inside ourselves and forgotten until now, when the ceiling briefly bowed like a person about to sneeze and the station made a sound like a hinge reconsidering its life.\n\nYou know how a room gets quiet right before someone says the inappropriate thing and then doesn\u2019t, and in that silence you can hear chairs making tiny adjustments to people? The air did that. The pillars shivered in their paint. The floor under us gave, not in the catastrophic way of collapse but in the mercy way of a trampoline that wants to show you how to be held. Someone gasped without permission. Arroyo put his hand on his radio like a talisman and did not key it because he is learning which noises to resist. I held my breath because the instinct to freeze is embedded deep in the animal that runs my ribs. Dana whispered, \u201cOh, hello,\u201d to the air as if greeting a stranger at a neighbor\u2019s party. The door to the old ticket office opened by itself and then closed with the caution of a shy cousin. The angels hummed very low and we all heard it in our knees.\n\nAfter, when the roof remembered its job and the clock remembered its lie, Holm said in a voice that had lost its edges, \u201cOkay,\u201d and nobody laughed because the humor would have broken like a cheap plate. We took inventory the way you do after a lovemaking that has made you weep: windows, fine; columns, fine; the poster with a smiling family from 1973 asking for exact change, still lying; Jun\u2019s stack of index cards, scattered like good seeds; my pulse, late to its appointments and therefore present. A Witness named Lo with the anchor tattoo ran a thumb across her bottom lip and said, \u201cIt didn\u2019t want to hurt us,\u201d and the way she said it sounded like she had been hurt by gentler things. Velez drifted down until it hung at head-height and its light was soft enough to make me think of the underside of clouds seen from a plane aisle, and said, \u201cThe fold is practicing its handwriting. The first drafts are less dangerous when you are not proud.\u201d\n\nWe had brought a different kind of ear, one that didn\u2019t need a drained pool or a meta-skin. Sana had designed it while waiting for a kettle and then kept it because it was cheap and therefore likely to survive dumb hands. It was a set of nested hoops, aluminum stamped with letters from an abandoned art project, hung with sleeves of silk and strips cut from ruined shirts, a chandelier that wanted to be a fishing net. We had tied bells to it, not for romance but because the ear inside our skulls is a drum and bells talk to drums in a language everybody inherits. We hung the thing from one of the old station hooks where luggage had rested with dignity when people still wore hats out of respect fully dressed. When the room creased, the bells shivered without ringing, which meant the motion wasn\u2019t air and wasn\u2019t sound the way we measure either, which meant we could, if we were stupid, call it nothing. We refused that. Dana tapped the hoops afterward with the bone end of a comb and nodded as if someone had answered a proof in the back of the book.\n\nWe added a line to the wall that afternoon in a handwriting I didn\u2019t recognize: Practice inside, it said. Then this, smaller: If the sky wants an audience, make it pay with your patience. No one admitted to writing it and everyone obeyed it because it had the rhythm of a rule our grandmothers would recognize. We started drilling people in bone song as if we were planning to field a choir against a storm. We taught breath to construction workers and toddlers and men with earnest beards and women whose nails kept clean not by care but by the chemistries they ran at their kitchens tables. We kept it unpretty on purpose so it would be memory, not spectacle. People started humming in bus shelters and grocery lines and public bathrooms devoted to hand dryers that lied about warmth. We became ridiculous and therefore correct.\n\nThe decision I had been told would find me like a letter slid under a door began sliding with an address in my handwriting. It was not the ship yet, not that made thing dreamers brawl over in drawings. It was a throw. We needed to send an instrument through the crease that had shown itself in the station and then pretended to be shy. People with PhDs were rightfully interested in equations and people with calluses were rightfully interested in whether the thing would come back, and the overlap was a Venn diagram big enough to stand in. They built a ball because balls are democratic technology. It was a sphere of lattice that looked like it had opinions about cage birds. Inside were sensors that bled numbers when poked and a core that smelled faintly like the inside of a blank tape cassette. It had velvet on one rib not because velvet helps but because Kieran had looked at the ring of bare metal and said it felt mean and then fixed it the way you fix mean when it\u2019s in your hand.\n\n\u201cYou could just roll it,\u201d Arroyo said, but his voice did not sound like a man who believed in rolling anything important while the world learned to crease.\n\n\u201cThe floor isn\u2019t honest,\u201d Sana said. She had measured it by feel and had written the measurements on her palm and then licked her thumb and wiped them away to write the same ones again.\n\n\u201cWhat if you throw it,\u201d Tam said, so casually I turned and stared at her like she had been hiding her face inside a tree all morning. \u201cI\u2019m serious. A punch, not a full send. Low and committed. No flourish. You know that shot better than anyone.\u201d\n\nThe room did the small cough rooms do when one job learns the shape of another job and pretends to have known it all along. I looked at the ball the way I look at a dog that has learned a trick on its own. I could see the line because my muscles had grown a map of how to make sight into physics. My hands itched with the ghost of a grip. The crease had been at shin height for a blink, a fault line in air rather than stone, a thing I could trace with the memory of the way a putt breaks near the cup when greenkeepers have been bored. I did not want to be a person whose best skill was applicable to folding realities. I also did.\n\nWe cleared the benches to make a corridor that looked like a wedding aisle if unions were for putting objects into unknowns. People stood along the edges with their hands at their sides, as per the rule, and swallowed hard the way you do when you think someone might be about to make a hole in your day. I took the ball into my hands and felt its weight and thanked some prior Rhea for chasing the kind of strength that is precision and not glory. I imagined the shot the way Coach had taught me: a movie that ends with a touch rather than a thud. I sank into my hips the way confidence does whether invited or not. I made the small rehearsal swing like a person remembering a handshake, and then I let the made piece of the world go.\n\nIt left my hand like a promise. It skimmed ankle height, a shrew running, and the air at the waist of the room became wrong just long enough for the ball to slide between one idea of where we were and another. For a second it wobbled, a glitch that made my throat go tight, and then it disappeared the way a coin disappears when someone skilled has palmed it and you are in on the trick but not on the muscle. A woman near the end of the corridor covered her mouth not because she believed it would bring it back but because sometimes the hand knows what ritual is needed and the brain will learn it later.\n\nWe had put a string on it because we are assholes and also because this is how you tie yourself to fate without admitting you\u2019re doing it. The string whispered across the floor and then went slack then taut then slack again like a cat thinking about jumping onto a counter. We all flinched in the same direction because pack animals still reside in us. When it rolled back under the bench I thought I might vomit because I did not want its answer. The lattice was dusted with something that made a rim like the ring in colin\u2019s mug. It was not ash. It was too simple to be ash. I did not recognize it, which is how you know you are alive; if the world stops showing you new white powders, it has given up. Sana extended a small brush the way mourning extends a hand to the door frame and coaxed a drift into a vial and made three more vials like she believed in redundant mercy.\n\nKieran sniffed the ball because men with math will still sniff first when we aren\u2019t watching, and then he laughed that noise he makes when a puzzle gives up a corner. \u201cSalt,\u201d he said, not triumphant, not disappointed, just naming. \u201cNothing earth salt knows how to be. A salt that hasn\u2019t tasted our oceans. A salt that doesn\u2019t like our ways of being water.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bunker,\u201d I said, and everyone made a face at me because my metaphors had been tolerated but not embraced. \u201cIn my dream,\u201d I added because sometimes you submit evidence you can\u2019t prove because it wants to be next to the other evidence to feel like a family.\n\nWe argued without drawing blood for once because the rule on the wall had begun to breed in us. There was a quick, ugly discussion about whether we should lick the salt. We did not lick the salt. Sana did the three simplest tests again because a genius repeats the small true things until they become furniture. It dissolved slower than we like. It made a smell like a library taking its socks off after a long walk. It did not fizz like disappointment. Dana wrote a symbol that looked like a ladder down a page that already had too many ladders. The angels did not advise. Velez watched me in the wary way good teachers watch the moment a student realizes they are about to be asked to go on a stage they can\u2019t see yet.\n\nAfter the witness circle formalized itself around what we had done, the room began to do what all rooms do now: it turned into a hub by stealth. That is, it sprouted tables with sign-in sheets, a box for lost items, a corner where one kid drew on the floor in chalk and nobody told him not to because his lines were better than tape. A woman with two first names ran a pot of coffee that smelled like something we no longer sell and regulated everyone\u2019s cup with the authority earned by running a coat check when winter meant something. We used the station for the first meeting we had avoided having: the not-quite-list of not-quite-rules for how to choose where to build more ears.\n\n\u201cBus lines first,\u201d I said, and Holm smiled as if I had just remembered a friend\u2019s birthday without being reminded. \u201cHubs need to be reachable without a car because the future can\u2019t hear engines whining any louder than we already make them. The people nearest the water that thinks it might be a wall. The buildings with chairs already inside them, not because chairs are special but because chairs are a language doors speak. And stop me if I sound like a stack of clipboards pretending to be a human.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sound like a human in a clipboard hat,\u201d Dana said, which is the kind of insult that in this house lands like an arm around your shoulders. \u201cAlso the places with bathrooms people won\u2019t be ashamed to use. Dignity is a mouth that doesn\u2019t open, but it keeps people fed.\u201d\n\n\u201cPut ears in places with a reputation for rumors,\u201d Arroyo added, surprising himself. \u201cThey\u2019ll keep an eye on it for free because they can\u2019t bear not to know. It\u2019s a sin we can use that isn\u2019t a sin if the sign-in sheet is honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will need power without wires,\u201d Sana said, eyes flicking to the ceiling as if power hung above us like ripe fruit. \u201cHuman-crank. Small turbines where the gutters like to shout. Bikes that work smarter. Remember how to get a friction match to behave. We\u2019ll need a maniac who will cure their obsession by making us a better battery.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know three,\u201d Jun said, not smug because he doesn\u2019t know how to be. \u201cI\u2019ll bribe them with snacks and the ability to name something they did not invent.\u201d\n\nI made a speech I hadn\u2019t rehearsed because no one would let me go write it, and it came out as a list of particularities because the generalities feel like stealing. I said, \u201cPut one in the barber shop where the father and son fight kindly on Saturdays. Put one behind the dance studio where the floor knows names. Put one near the daycare that won\u2019t call itself a daycare because it knows the word makes some men feel weird about paying women. Put one in the senior center that smells like bingo markers and lies told without harm. Put one in the old parking garage where the reverb is good because it accidentally teaches you how to listen.\u201d The angels brightened the way I have learned means thank you and apology and promise all at once, and I put my hands on the back of the folding chair I\u2019d been standing behind because Donna, the woman who ran the coffee, had put her purse on it and I imagined her finding it later intact and liked the picture of her face.\n\nWe convened a Witness council without a table and without minutes and it still worked because Vincente brought markers in colors that looked like juice and wrote on butcher paper like graffiti. The names on the wall became a constellation that made a path if you squinted. Barber. Zipper-fixer. Librarian. Soup-line. Anchor-wrist. Lightning tech. Teen with humming radius. Bus driver with a rosary made of fuses. It felt like making a team out of an orphanage when the orphanage was run by the orphans.\n\nMy phone buzzed against my thigh, the insect of obligation, and I stepped away into a hall that smelled like old tile and decided not to answer because the corridor had that old building echo that makes every voice sound like it\u2019s from thirty years ago. Velez followed because it\u2019s learned that hallways are where humans admit the thing their mouths can\u2019t do in front of a bench. \u201cYou could have been a violin maker,\u201d it said, a door opening on a story I hadn\u2019t planned for.\n\n\u201cBecause my hands pay attention,\u201d I said, and put my forehead against the cool paint of the pillar because it had been keeping people up so long it deserved a kiss. \u201cOr because I like to fix what makes a tone.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you are patient with a thing that refuses to be rushed,\u201d it said. \u201cBecause you do not take a tool to a grain that will not like it and call that leadership. Because you could have spent your whole life listening to wood remember tree and you did not, and now you are listening to air remember water.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me another thing I don\u2019t want to know,\u201d I said, and immediately regretted it because every time I ask for that kind of hurt something important is delivered along with a bruise.\n\n\u201cWe cannot go,\u201d it said simply, and its light did that dimming that now felt like the lowering of a gaze. \u201cWe are made of your dark. We do not belong to the places we will tell you the songs of. We can hover and sing and warn and ache. We cannot be citizens there. We are a technology of witness, not a species for export.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re stuck in the play you helped direct,\u201d I said, not unkind because I had seen this face on a hundred mothers and on myself. \u201cIs that why you used the word forgive in public and didn\u2019t flinch.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not deserve the pronouns we use,\u201d it said. \u201cWe say we because it feels like a coat that lets us walk around in daylight and that is a lie we will be chewing forever. We have been made into a choir when once we were the thing that eats the audience. We will not be rewarded with applause. We will be asked to sing as you walk out. It is fair. It is unbearable. Both.\u201d\n\nI do not have the right to be the person who comforts a being that used to thirst for my blood, and yet here we are; we are always comforting the wrong person because the right person is busy. I touched the air two inches from where its shoulder would be if it had one and felt a heat like a lamp on a kind of almost-skin. \u201cYou can come to the hubs and sit in the rafters,\u201d I said. \u201cYou can stand over the insulin and hum like a refrigerator. You can terrify only those who deserve it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d it said, and if light can swallow once, it did. \u201cWe will build your ears and guard your ears and fight your mouths with our shame. We will do none of your choosing because you would die under our choosing. We will hold your jackets flat.\u201d\n\nWe went back into the station and the meeting had become a potluck without food. Everyone was putting up offerings: a schedule here, a car with a trunk there, a nephew who made drones out of parts that had never met. Dona from the soup-line had taped a sign to a pillar that said COOKS, and under it three names and two phone numbers and a little smile face that gave me more courage than angel light. Arroyo was teaching a teenager to say no to authority by letting him practice at him. Holm had cornered a councilman who had arrived with a suit and a face like stern pie and was explaining to him the difference between oversight and hovering; he looked like he was learning, and I did not take bets. Sana had used a shopping bag to make a sling for the lattice ball because people kept cradling it like a baby and I couldn\u2019t stand watching them rehearse a nursery.\n\nThat was the day the blowout-hair man tried to own a hub with a camera. He arrived on the station steps with a crew that moved like it had learned ballet in rooms with poor tile and the word exclusive on a board. He said my name the way a dentist says cavity. He asked to tour the ear because taxpayers and oversight and chain of command when applied to air. He held a microphone in the way a child holds a bug: anticipation and disgust. I did not step outside because if I had my body would have makes shapes my mother would have told me to save for the mirror. I sent Jun with a stack of clipboards and a lemon. Jun handed him a clipboard and a pen and said, \u201cWrite down what you will do for us besides speak,\u201d and held the lemon up to the camera and said, \u201cThis is our current symbol for people who help. You can hold it if you want.\u201d There is a clip of his face taking in citrus and failing to turn it into rhetoric, and I keep it on my phone for the nights I want proof that symbols are only powerful if they stick to skin.\n\nWe wrote the No Mouths pledge on the back of an old train map that still showed a lake that had become a park. It started as three sentences and then grew sentences around their hips like children holding on to mothers\u2019 legs. We put a swear in it on purpose so people would feel like it was theirs and not a grant proposal. We made everyone read it out loud who wanted to stand near an ear for longer than a song. Some people rolled their eyes and read it anyway because they wanted to be near a miracle. Some people read it and cried at the fourth line and then pretended they had a cold and we pretended not to notice. We taped the pledge next to the sign that said BATHROOMS and people read both with equal attention and I don\u2019t know anything that made me happier for a full hour after.\n\nThat night, tired thicker than soup, I went back to the course with Tam because the station\u2019s air had filled me with iron filings and I needed to become a magnet again. The floodlights were off because electricity is now something you ask permission from and I am trying to become a person who does not assume my yes is the first one. The fairways were silhouettes, wider at night like people who soften when nobody\u2019s watching. The bunker on seventeen lay where it always lies like a love that had been useful and then mean. We lay on our backs near the tee and looked up with the decision to see nothing but imagined stars even if they were doing the wrong thing. Tam pointed and told me a different kind of constellation: that\u2019s the one that looks like the bus stop where we met the woman who had the cat in her hood; that\u2019s the one that looks like the pile of shoes at the gym door after the sky tried to argue with us; that\u2019s the one that looks like your face when you said the word planets and didn\u2019t faint. I laughed, then hiccuped, then choked a little, then laughed again, and thought, if joy were on the schedule, it would never get done. You have to sneak it into the notes someone left on the break room fridge.\n\nWe launched the first not-ship a week later, and it wasn\u2019t a ship because we had kept our promise to ourselves. It was a moth made by stubborn hands, a raft for air, a kite with a chordal heart. The kids named it Moth because they are accountants of poetry and I want them in my government. It was a skeleton of rods and mesh the color of the inside of a seashell, with a belly full of ears and a spine that whistled when the wind got fresh. We built it in a school gym that had given up learning dodgeball and taken on learning humility. Jun made a checklist that ended with the line breathe. Lo drove it on a flatbed through streets that had learned, embarrassingly quickly, how to make room. People came out and put hands flat on its ribs because touching is how we make contracts we can\u2019t afford lawyers for. We rolled it onto the roof of the station because the sky had been rude there and because lifting a thing toward its work is ceremonial whether you want it to be or not.\n\nThe angels did not bless it because we are trying not to become a place where wind has titles. They stood three stories up in the air the way a good parent stands at the end of a diving board and puts their hands out without expecting a child to fall toward them. We held the lines like you hold a friend\u2019s hair when she is sick. The wind did what wind does when it is being watched and remembered its if, and we waited, which is the part that feels like weakness and is actually the muscle. When it took, it took clean. Moth rose without dramatics and our breath went with it and then came back because the rule on the wall had started becoming blood. It shivered where the air had creased a week before and didn\u2019t shatter, which taught me a new word from inside a word I thought I knew.\n\nThe data it sent down was less important than the message it sent our bodies, which is a sentence I will have tattooed one day if the world gets back its habit of making people do silly things with needle and ink. Numbers are love letters written by different kinds of mouths and we will keep them, frame them, argue about them, make new instruments just to be able to talk back to the parts that looked us in the eye. What mattered was watching a thing we made stand in a wind we didn\u2019t invent and not apologize. What mattered was the way the kids on the roof grabbed each other\u2019s hands without making a show of it, the way Arroyo said copy to the air and meant thank you, the way Holm didn\u2019t check her phone for a full three minutes and then checked it and laughed because a councilman had texted her Are the angels unionizing which meant we had won a different small war.\n\nWe had our first theft that week, and it did not come with the anger I\u2019d rehearsed for. Someone stole thirty vials from the freezer labeled with numbers I had learned like hymnals. We discovered it because the freezer door, which had been screwed up from a police auction and then unscrewed back down by a grandmother who knows where to kick, had been left open ajar enough to make the motor complain. The list on the whiteboard had a smear where the row of numbers lived, not frantic, deliberate, the work of a person who believes in erasers. We followed the line of sugar water drip that had been knocked over like a person too tired to be careful, and it led to a back door and then into a morning that smelled like eggs cooked in a pan without love.\n\nWe learned the thief\u2019s name not because we\u2019re detectives but because this is a city and names are communal property, and when you say \u201cshe had a scar like a comma by her mouth and a way of carrying a bag like a shift,\u201d someone will say, \u201cAllegra,\u201d and then five minutes later Allegra will be at the door because she has better hearing than most. She cried with that quiet experienced kind because this was not about her remorse; it was about her tiredness. She had built a mouth in an old laundromat with a boyfriend who wanted to marry her before the fold or die trying, and the mouth had been good at lying about its charms. They had poured a song in with a funnel they stole from the back of the bar and an air popped and her boyfriend had said he could see the other side and then couldn\u2019t because it wasn\u2019t a side and he had gone down like a man remembering a hole he\u2019d made in a field as a kid. She brought the vials back in a cooler that used to have a marlin on it, and I thought about punching her and then I thought about how much I had loved someone I was going to lose once and didn\u2019t, and I handed her a sandwich. Velez stood in the corner like a judgement we had all decided not to invite and did not speak, which is its new way of honoring us.\n\nWe wrote a new line on the wall that day in a slant hand: Forgive the crimes that come from practicing badly. Punish only the ones that come from selling tickets. Holm made a face and it wasn\u2019t because she disapproved; it was because it had the cadence of a rule that would get her yelled at by people who value the word consequences the way some people value lace. She signed off anyway with the line one uses when one is about to get yelled at by people who eat steak in rooms with wide tables: \u201cWe\u2019ll do the reasonable thing and call it extreme.\u201d I kissed her cheek and she threatened to revoke my privileges and we both laughed because it was the kind of fake threat you make to the people who are holding you up while you pretend to hold them up.\n\nThere is a photograph somewhere I hope no one ever sees because its beauty would get it framed by the wrong people: three angels hovering over a line of kids pulling on a rope attached to Moth while a woman with a baby slung across her asleep like a limp question holds a clipboard and a cup of coffee and does not spill either. The sky in the photo is a sky the fold has put on to make us complacent, all syrup and tender. If I had to make a monument to exactly what I want to bring to wherever we go, it would be that rope and those hands and that cup stabilized by the muscle memory of care.\n\nWe started losing sleep on a schedule you could put in an app if anyone could stand inventing another app. Dana\u2019s ears got sharp around one in the morning; she would show up with a hoodie inside out and a piece of metal clamped in her teeth to chew. Kieran turned into a person you could only talk to by writing on his arm and he would look down and find your sentence and then answer you in a sketch that looked like it had already been in the air for days. Sana laughed more and it scared me how much I wanted to bring her tea because tea is the only thing I can make that pretends to be professional. Arroyo stopped wearing the rank jacket altogether and built a little shelf by the gym door for people to leave their rings on while they carried water and his hands got used to handing back gold and silver with the kind of respect churches used to teach. Jun got two white hairs that he looked at in the mirror like prizes. Tam learned to sleep in chairs like a man on a train with his head tipped forward and his mouth open and no concern for his own dignity because home had been relocated to the corner of a table.\n\nThe night the moth came down in a new way, the wind wasn\u2019t bad. That\u2019s the thing I have learned that I keep wanting to put on billboards and can\u2019t: most days now will not announce themselves as big in the way your body expects big to show up. We had two lines on it, one literal, one the string that goes between a group of people when they\u2019re doing something dumb carefully. It had been writing numbers down its tether as if Xs were love letters and we were gossip mongers with stacks of stationary. Then it stopped writing and we all looked up like bad dogs. It drifted sideways the way a person drifts at a party when they are done being polite. The mesh hummed in a bad key. Nobody shouted because the station remembers what shouting is for. Lo and Arroyo and two school custodians with matching shoulders walked to the edge the way you walk to the edge of a lake you\u2019re going to jump into because your cousin dared you, calm, breath like a man counting the paces of a driveway. They hauled hand over hand and the rope came in with a wobble that made my teeth chatter because my body loves the wrong things. When the moth came over the lip, it smelled like pennies and then like peach skin and then like a chandelier that had tried too hard at a wedding. We set it down on blankets and went on with our lives because the best way to make something unmagical in the good sense is to put it on a blanket and hand it a cup of water.\n\nFive days later a school sent us a gift that made me think we might be able to become the kind of people who deserve gifts. They had found a way to tell a town that the sky was rehearsing without triggering fear so intense it would get in the way of the smaller duties. The announcement was a sound, and then a color on phones that had a battery, and then a chalk mark on a door that had no electricity and still could be read as easily as a book. It was three lines long and written like a diabetic\u2019s shopping list: stay in; breathe so your bones hear; sing if you must. We laughed because they had stolen our line and then we sent them bread because stealing is the sincerest form of food. The blowout-hair man tried to trademark Stay In and was told no even by the people who like to say yes to men with watches. It was a stupid victory. I put it on the wall anyway.\n\nI thought the first big fight would be obvious, a man with a speech and a banner and a flag he had ironed. It came as a woman with good teeth and a smile that had convinced people to buy vitamins. She came to a hub with a crew and did not go to the ear or the insulin or the sock table. She went to the line where we were matching people who hate meetings with their first ten meetings and said loudly that we were going to put people on lists. She said we were going to put stickers on doors. She said the word loyalty like it had ankles she could grab. She used my name like a game piece she was moving on a board she\u2019d brought. People looked at me and I looked at my hands because if I had lifted them the words would have been ugly.\n\nTam laughed once, not loudly, but with the clarity of a bell in a station. She walked to the sock table and held up a sock, the ugliest one because it had a cartoon that had not aged well. \u201cWe\u2019re putting socks on feet,\u201d she said, and the room turned toward the true thing because the true thing had been held up like a flag. \u201cWe\u2019re putting water in buckets. We\u2019re putting kids in circles where they can hum without the sky noticing. If you need a list, you can have one; it will be shopping. It will say lemons. It will say tape. It will say dignity.\u201d The crowd laughed and then applauded and the woman\u2019s smile turned into the kind you put on when you lose at monopoly, and I remembered to breathe because Tam had handed me the rope again without making me feel less for needing it.\n\nWe wrote a kinder rule on the wall that night because the mean rules were breeding too easily: Give people a job they can finish in an afternoon. Don\u2019t let them go home with a list that spans months. Feed them or they will eat their fear. Holm added in small letters, Pay them if you can in money, not coupons, and I hugged her around the shoulders and she stiffened like a person not used to being touched casually and then allowed herself to melt in stages until it was over and she didn\u2019t have to acknowledge it.\n\nI got sick, which is not heroic and also a plot device I resent, and which happened because bodies are rude. It wasn\u2019t a sky sickness or a fold cold; it was the old friend who shows up when you\u2019ve been sleeping in a chair and licking stale coffee off your teeth. Fever hung from me like a necklace I couldn\u2019t unclasp. For two days the hubs ran without me, which is how I learned that a good job is one where you can vanish and the thing continues. Tam sat beside the couch reading a manual about pressure cookers in case we needed to sterilize instruments and every once in a while read a line aloud and I would laugh and cough and then say, \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone build a mouth,\u201d and she would say, \u201cWe put that in the code, you are not that special,\u201d and I would sleep again. Velez stationed itself across the room like a lamp that could ward off thieves, and Jun wrote on my wall in pencil and then erased it when I complained about the mess and then wrote again because he knows me better than I do.\n\nOn the third day the fever snapped like a bad string and I woke to the sound of brooms on a gym floor and Sana telling someone to hold the funnel less like a weapon and more like a promise. The window showed a morning that was pretending to be ordinary and I made coffee with my hand shaking and spilled half of it on my notes, which felt like a blessing if you have ever been the kind of person who wants to ruin her own writing so she can move on. The map by the plant had grew new lines that I hadn\u2019t drawn, and I didn\u2019t ask who had added them because the point of a map is not ownership. It is consent.\n\nWe took the Moth out again that afternoon to get it back on the horse it didn\u2019t know it had fallen off and because sometimes our tools are more anxious than we allow. The angels made themselves small, which is their signal they intend humility, and the sky was a kind of blue that had just learned to miss something. We sang the song for Ridgetone like we were family who had learned to be on time for once, and the ear tugged against its lines and then lifted the way my heart lifted when I heard a particular laugh in a crowd. A child asked if the fold would be mad if we used it and I said, \u201cI think it is a door learned by a hand; it likes to be useful,\u201d and the child said, \u201cI don\u2019t like being useful,\u201d and I said, \u201cMe either, but the pay is good if you mean sleep,\u201d and he looked at me like I had not earned that joke yet and went back to counting knots in the rope.\n\nWe started a newsletter because the part of me that wants to be a librarian will not be silenced entirely, and called it Buckets & Bells because acronyms are banned and also because any other title would have been an apology. We printed it on paper because phones are luxury pets now and because paper travels through hubs like water. We put lists in it that mattered and stories that kept those lists from acquiring the over-seriousness of a memo. We published the recipe for the chaotic pie Mrs. Davila makes when the room has been too righteous and she is under orders to put jam into adults and a crust on their tongues. We published a cartoon of an angel holding a jacket flat and people cut it out and taped it next to their hooks and I went into a stairwell and let my knees do the thing they do.\n\nToward the end of the month that cannot be named anymore because the months had given up their loyalties, the sky rehearsed at noon. It was worse because people were in the middle of tasks that could not withstand interruption without becoming humiliation. A woman carrying a stack of trays remembered that she had once dropped a stack of plates in a restaurant and been yelled at so sharply she had gone to the bathroom and thrown up and learned then how to keep her hands steady when catastrophe wanted to have sex with shame. She did not drop the trays now. Men on a scaffolding sat down like they had been made ninety suddenly and grinned at each other as if they were finally allowed to admit fear was a warm animal and not a snake. A boy put his finger on a page in a book and did not lose his place, and I wanted to put that in a museum that would still be standing when this was over.\n\nWe made a library of smells at Sana\u2019s insistence because she is the only one among us who knows you cannot build a ship without building what it will think is food. She tacked strips of cloth on a board and labeled them with numbers and grimaces. Resin taught grief. Lake taught forgiveness. Meat tried to pretend it had never hurt anyone. Bread came from six kitchens and we kept them separate because merging good things too early is how you make them into a paste. We collected dust from under a hundred beds and found trace elements of shame and sex and sleep and decided to catalog all of it because ships will need to know who we were and because catalogs make people behave. We taped the board next to the ears on the wall with a line that said nose training because there is nothing wrong with being exactly what you are.\n\nThat night a priest and a woman who claimed to be an exorcist and a scientist who builds quiet fans got into a fight about whether the fold would appreciate a blessing, and I hid behind a stack of chairs and pretended to be a chair. The debate got not stupid but loud, and the angels dimmed in the way we have come to understand as their version of rolling their eyes. The exorcist said a word in a language my body recognized and winced, and the scientist said drag coefficient five times and made gestures in the air that I swear moved a breeze, and the priest said a sentence so kind it made me suspicious of his knees. We blessed the Moth because refusing to bless a thing is how you make a hole in a room that drafts. We blessed it with caution and seasoning salt and a line drawn in chalk so no one would walk under the line and be mad about superstition later. It came home that night smelling like the page of a book you have kept pressed to your face for just a second too long and I thought, we are all learning how to hold.\n\nWhen I write \u201cwe have a plan\u201d now I mean we have a plan like a person has a recipe written by a grandmother who eyeballed everything and refused to tell you the oven temperature because she knew you would learn from the way the kitchen smelled. We have ears and we have hubs and we have one moth and we have a pledge and a broom schedule and a No Mouths wall. We have lines on maps that are being redrawn by a river with new ideas. We have a woman who tapes up the flyers that say HUM PRACTICE and also a woman who comes to tear them down because she hates singing and I am glad she exists because voices like hers keep us from becoming a cult. We have angels who cannot go and a list of names of people who will. We have a shoplifted cooler and a freezer indicted and redeemed. We have stolen sleep and stolen lemons and a boy who told me my jokes were not yet earned. We have an old station breathing again and a golf course that lets me count the times I have been made to stand still and survive it.\n\nWe do not have ships. We do not have a perfect way to choose who will go first when the time comes. We have trial runs and prayers we will not call prayers because labels are expensive and I am saving money. We have the first call from a small town on a coast I used to think of as vacation that says the water came up the street and did not knock. We have the second call from a hospital that says their windows are making a friend of light and is that bad, and our answer is yes and also excellent, can we visit. We have my mother\u2019s sandwich in my mouth like the memory of salt and we have my father\u2019s measuring tape running across a table the size of seven kitchens put together, and somewhere inside both those truths is a place big enough for a moth and small enough for a hand.Chapter 10\n\nBy the time the air learned to be hot again, the city had a choir of hammers. You could walk three blocks with your eyes shut and name what kind of building you were next to by the pitch of the knocking: low for stages disassembled and repurposed as shelves, bright for sheet metal turned into frames, fussing little taps for the kind of work that needs fingers more than forearms. Buckets & Bells started printing on both sides of the page, which felt like evolution and thrift at once. We declared the next seven days No Mouths Week and the kids made chalk circles outside every ear room with the pledge written around them in letters that ran out of space and doubled back like small brave snakes. The rules wall in the gym had begun to look like the inside of a teenager\u2019s locker, all stickers and authority, but it worked better than anything else we had: you could point at Dignity and then point at the stack of paper gowns and people would take the gowns without rehearsing shame.\n\nA stadium out by the river that had been empty since the team left became a dry port without anyone announcing it. People rolled in from the spine of the state with their trunks full of seed and their mouths full of news and their backs full of ideas about distance. We called the kits that left that place hearths because calling them packages made people imagine coupons and we needed kitchens. Each kit was a careful little list in a crate: a crank that didn\u2019t mind wet hands, a bell tuned to a note that made people stand up without wanting to fight, a binder labeled with handwriting you wanted to trust, a tarp the color of hope if you had never seen the ocean, and a sleeve of stitched meta that had learned to be humble. The best part was that by the time the second batch went out, they came back with additions we hadn\u2019t ordered: a scarf woven by a grandmother that made the ear behave better in wind; a whistle someone had carved from PVC that worked only when held by a left-handed person and thus became everyone\u2019s favorite; a recipe stapled to the inside cover for beans that tasted like wealth even when nothing in the pot could be counted as fancy. I watched the kit move from our hands into hands that had calluses I had never earned and felt the relief that is letting go without dropping.\n\nCity Hall tried to create a box to keep all this inside and to their credit the box was at least transparent. Holm called it a Civic Commons Charter because she knows how to make a thing sound inevitable and kind at once. It was a handful of promises written without commas and three sentences forbidding the exact kind of theft we had seen attempted in suits and in prayer shawls: no ownership of ears; no privatizing songs; no putting a ribbon on angel light and calling it brand. A councilman with shoes you could shave in gave a speech about oversight as if it were a vitamin you need to crush into applesauce to tolerate, and Holm said over the top of him, not shouting but with that tone she keeps in a pocket, \u201cWe are not deregulating kindness.\u201d We signed in the station because paper matters still, and then we put the signed paper on the wall where anybody could draw a mustache on it if they wanted, and nobody did which felt like a small miracle in a city that used to live on graffiti.\n\nThe fold came to a hospital like a rumor that walked in the front door and paid at the desk. It was noon, which felt like an insult because everyone had jobs at noon. The elevators stopped in between opinions about floors. A gurney drifted sideways as if the ground had changed its mind about left. The new ear room we had wedged into an old chapel took the hit like a good aunt, all open arms and low humming, and people who had been taught to keep feelings outside tools put their palms against the silk so their bones would make the sound travel the right way. The windows whispered, a sound like paper prep in a classroom, and every nurse in the place thought about the night they had been handed a tray for the first time and been told not to tilt. A man died, not from the sky doing theater but because his heart had been practicing to leave anyway, and we stopped everything we were doing and learned how to do funerals without making a false shape out of loss. We wrote on the wall later, in a corner where grief could pretend to be private, Funerals will be human even when we are busy. We will say names. We will not turn anybody into a motto. We will feed the mourners cake they do not have to thank us for.\n\nMoth came back twice with salt and then once with a powder that wasn\u2019t salt and made Sana sit down, which is a more reliable measurement than anything she could have written on a board. The new stuff made a soft clinking noise when you breathed too near it, as if there was an inside that wanted out but remembered itself in time. Under the scope it looked like small cities that had planned their own suburbs with better taste than ours. Kieran suggested, in a voice that he didn\u2019t trust yet, that this could be the shape of oxygen finding something to live with, and we stood around and waited for the air not to betray us with the smell of false hope. Sana did the idiot-proof tests first because she is an angel by practice and a scientist by job: she put a leaf near it and the leaf didn\u2019t curl; she put a flame near it and it didn\u2019t leap; she put her own curiosity near it and it snapped at her and she smiled and wrote don\u2019t trust, then later wrote trust enough to try again. We wrote a new line that felt like a prayer we could admit: We might not need domes if we learn to sit with the weather.\n\nAt home the pressure cooker made a sound like a building that knows its purpose and is satisfied. Tam learned to talk to the hissing the way she talks to me when I am about to bolt: with patience and laughter as if neither were hard. She made a stew out of what the hub had left, which means it tasted like generosity and cumin, and she watched me eat it like she was checking for leaks. We spoke about after as if it were a town we had been to as kids and had to find on a different map. Jun came in with hair like a good idea and a spreadsheet he had printed so I could look at it without screens. He had made a gift matrix because he is the only person I have ever met who believes that gratitude should have columns. It asked questions like who did you thank this week with your mouth and who did you thank with your hands and who did you avoid thanking because you think it will make them ask for more. He stuck it to the fridge with a magnet shaped like a tomato and I loved him with the kind of suddenness that makes you want to run a lap around your own apartment to get rid of the extra electricity.\n\nThe blowout-hair man opened a pop-up with lights and tried to sell admissions to a mouth built behind blackout curtains. It was in a warehouse that used to make fake snow and now made memory problems. He called it The Way and if I\u2019d had the energy I\u2019d have sued his graphic designer for crimes against meaning. A teen took a photo and sent it to Lo and Lo sent it to the group thread with a picture of her anchor tattoo and the words not on my route, and ten minutes later Arroyo and two door people and a cluster of aunties arrived to stand in the doorway and do the steady stare that makes even men with clipboards admit their mothers taught them better. A man in a hat told us we were suppressing innovation and I said, without raising my voice, \u201cJukeboxes are innovation. Doors that swing one way are traps,\u201d and the auntie with the best earrings wrote in lipstick on the loading dock in letters as tall as shame: No Kings. We repainted it later, not because anyone told us to but because the statement deserved better paint.\n\nVelez came to the station and stood so still you could mistake it for sculpture, which meant it had learned it would be listened to without arranging a scene. It said ships must be shaped like agreements, which made me laugh because I had been part of organizations that treated agreements like shoes. It said not arrows, which landed in me like a stone I would want to pick up and hold. It taught us a word, not in our mouth language, more in the way that breath learns the sound of its own threshold: sleeve. Not a tube. Not a gate. A soft length of listening we could keep open for six seconds without anything alive in it and then ten, and then maybe a minute if we were people who remembered to be small. We said the word in the station and the bells on the ear made a sound that sounded like the corner of a laugh.\n\nThe first sleeve was the color of the sky when a bruise is thinking about itself. We built it in the station where the ceiling had learned to ask a question. It was stitched by six women who had never met before that week and now shared pins like recipes. We hung it from a rig that Lo\u2019s bus barn had donated after someone used a correct mixture of sincerity and cookies, and the rig had the good sense to confess its limits. The sleeve hung like laundry, which made me want to cry because I could not stand how domestic the apocalypse had become on its best days. We did not put anything through it except air and then a stream of scent and then the sound of the song which is also weight. We held the rig while the sky did its tiny training pushups. The sleeve tightened the way we do when someone we don\u2019t know walks too close. The smell that slid back was not lake and not bread and not anything in our library. It was the smell of a page just before you turn it when you know the next paragraph will hurt and you keep going anyway. We wrote Sleeve behaves, Day 1, and then we went home and slept as if we had a teacher.\n\nI started telling people no more often, which I suppose is what happens when you are asked for a full-time yes. I stopped going to the meetings where people wanted me to bless their plans with my eyebrows. I started showing up at places where my body would remind me why bodies are the first technology we learn: the barber shop that had grown a phone-charging station out of a shelf of aftershaves, the laundromat where the exorcist had taken a night job and folded socks in pairs as an act of mercy, the diner where the coffee had started tasting like it used to because a kid had gotten good at cleaning the machine. In each, someone would hand me a note to tape to the wall or a lemon or a clip for my hair that had a piece missing and I would hold the broken thing and say thank you as if the thank you were glue.\n\nHolm got yelled at by men who had never learned to find their daughters at a hub without a map and I watched her take the yelling with the face you wear when you\u2019re waiting for the water to boil and someone else is trying to tell you which bubble is legal. She stood on the stairs at City Hall and told a man in a hat who wanted the word loyalty written large over the doors to the hubs that the word neighbor had more letters and more hands in it. She took a call in the stairwell about trucks we needed to move refrigerators we had borrowed from a closing ice cream place and I saw her smile a smile I will never forget because it was how a person looks when the world finally matches the list they have been keeping in a pocket for a decade. I brought her tea with a wedge of lemon because Jun was on a campaign for citrus and she drank it without remarking on my attempt at ministering and then said, \u201cDo we have a plan for babies,\u201d and I said, \u201cWe have ten,\u201d and truthfully we had four and a half and a woman named Bee who had found a way to sterilize bottles in a crockpot and whose name made me feel like we were going to be okay.\n\nThere was a day when every dog in the city barked for thirty-seven seconds and then stopped and sat down and looked guilty. We wrote it on the wall under a heading called Animal News and then we watched for anything else that had a rhythm and the only thing that matched was that every dishwasher that still worked in the city hiccuped the same hiccup at the same time. We decided to not anthropomorphize dishwashers out loud in public and then did it in the stairwell anyway. Sana circled the time on her chart and drew an arrow to a dip on a graph that made my stomach do a reasonable thing: it refused to turn into story. We have learned to only story after counting and I wish that were a habit I had learned earlier in a different life that did not require so many people to stand still in gyms while their bones learned to sing.\n\nWe took Moth out with candy in our pockets because we had finally admitted that small sugar at the right instant turns certain men into the children they used to be and makes them better at ropes. A second sleeve went up and the sky did not insult our work with calm; it pushed just enough to examine our stitching. We braced and did not perform. I thought about my driver like a talisman and put my hands in my pockets so I wouldn\u2019t reach for it and make a scene. The song of Ridgetone turned in the sleeve like soup and came back thicker and I watched three teenagers look at each other and decide they were going to live long enough to make new harmonies even if they never left the ground. We do not brag, we put our hands on the rig and say thank you without choosing a subject.\n\nNews came from the coast that had once been for postcards. The water had taken a street without knocking, and the hub had done the thing it is designed to do if we tell it to: it became a porch. The ear hung near the ceiling and sang in a key the town had not practiced and the town hummed in a key it had, and between those two truths the folding did not break anybody that day. We wrote a new line on the wall in the hand of the woman who had called it in: The porch is a science. We underlined it twice because it felt like a sentence the future was going to come back to and ask us to explain with chairs.\n\nThe first real bad, the kind with teeth, came wearing our own handwriting. In a neighborhood that had beat us to building an ear they also built a schedule and then they fell in love with their own clipboard. They started refusing people who could sing because they couldn\u2019t spell pledge. Someone taped a sign that said MEMBERS ONLY and I went very still in the way that tells me I am about to be mean if I don\u2019t swallow. I did not go. Lo went, because Lo has the voice mothers recognize as equal and the patience of a person who has driven a bus through five types of weather. She stood with her anchor wrist and her binder and said, \u201cNo one can trademark humming,\u201d and then she read our charter out loud in the slow voice you reserve for bedtime stories and traffic court and by the third sentence a man with a badge on a lanyard started to cry because badges don\u2019t fit in mouths and his tongue knew it. We wrote, later, in a different color, Don\u2019t become your own border.\n\nA scientist three time zones away sent us a new instrument she had built out of shame and copper. It listened for pressure shifts and spit out numbers like rain and I learned to love it because it didn\u2019t make any sound itself: humility you plug into the wall. She wrote in her note, in tiny letters I had to borrow a teenager\u2019s young eyes to read, Our fans keep lying to us about drag; yours tell the truth; keep the truth. I built her a small altar in my head next to my mother\u2019s jar of sugar and my father\u2019s tape that never ran out and put on it a piece of ribbon from the sleeve we had retired when a stitch gave up and we patched it with a bandana. I do not know if this is prayer. It felt like the only way to say thank you to a person I had never touched.\n\nWe were asked to speak to the world on a day that smelled like the library and I put my head down on my kitchen table because I could not stand the idea of being a mouth that big. The request came without an ultimatum and with a time window inside which everyone had agreed to stop yelling. We decided the sender was either a genius or a person who\u2019d had one good experience with silence in a yoga class and tried to give it back to the planet. Holm wanted a draft in case a microphone failed; Sana wanted three numbers to anchor it so the sky would know we weren\u2019t trying to seduce it; Jun wanted an index card with the words water, buckets, dignity, lists, no kings; Tam wanted me to wear the hoodie and not the jacket because people trust fray more than polish. Velez wanted nothing and that felt like the greatest generosity of all. I wrote on paper I had spilled stew on because I wanted the words to sit inside something that had fed me and if that isn\u2019t ritual I don\u2019t know what is. I wrote, Hello. I am a person. We have a plan, and then I wrote, Our plan is a verb. We need you to build a room for later people. It will smell like bread and resin and the first day of a school where the teacher looks at you like a name instead of a seat. Bring buckets. Bring bells. Bring a neighbor who hates this. We will be there first and last and in between. I crossed out three metaphors and kept two and went to wash my face.\n\nThe night before, the neighborhood practiced joy because it was on the schedule and I will die on the hill that scheduling joy is the only way to guarantee it happens. The gym turned into a dance not to forget but to remember that bones can move in ways that have nothing to do with fear. An angel held jackets flat from the rafters and I tried not to love the sight too much because I am trying not to become sentimental in the face of cosmic apology and failing in moderate ways daily. The sleeve hung from its rig like a line of laundry not yet taken inside because the weather was behaving like a parent after a meeting with a teacher. The fold made a small wrinkle overhead and we hummed and the wrinkle passed and no one bought a candle at a markup, which is how I measure maturity in a populace that has learned to forgive itself a few times without turning that into a hat.\n\nI slept with my driver under the bed on purpose because I wanted to feel ridiculous and domestic at once, and my body knows that feeling is the only door to sleep left to me. In my dream the fairway that is not grass opened into a field where women were laying sleeves on the ground like quilts while kids ran their hands over the seams to learn what it means to trust a stitch. The flag was not a bird that day. It was a handkerchief with a recipe written in my mother\u2019s handwriting and an apology written in Velez\u2019s light, and both of them made a kind of sense I can only experience when I am lying down. I woke at five to the sound of coffee in someone else\u2019s kitchen and the city did the slightly embarrassed shuffle of a person who has been caught practicing something tender. I stood at the window and watched the sky not break and took that as a blessing even if it meant nothing. Then I wrote on the wall, quietly so as not to wake the others, Sleep is what we give in exchange for tomorrow, and underneath it, the smallest letters I am capable of, Practice joy.",

Dew on the fairways of the municipal course out past the river, maintenance guys muttering, a distant herring gull scissoring apart a take-out box. I had the place to myself except for Tam, who wore her wool cap over a too-messy bun and held the shag bag like it was a reliquary. She\u2019s been my caddie since before the tour, before my first sponsor, back when my shoes were unstitching and my wrists were raw with tape. She knew the arc of my drives better than I did. She knew when I was going to top it by the way my jaw set.\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d she said, as the ball climbed and climbed, catching an angle in the cold air I hadn\u2019t seen before. \u201cHear that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hear a five-iron doing what it was told.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cSome kind of\u2026 choir.\u201d\n\nI tilted my head. Nothing but the low hum of the highway, the mosquitoes that never slept, distant dogs arguing with their own chains. And then, like a whale surfacing in a dark sea, sound. A draped shimmer, an organ pipe bent around itself. Not in the air, though. Inside. My skull bones ringing. A long, braided note that felt like peppermint on a cracked lip.\n\nThe ball hung and hung, then descended in a way that made Tam, who hates poetry, say, \u201cThat was like a moth. Like it decided.\u201d\n\n\u201cWind shift,\u201d I said. \u201cThermals.\u201d\n\nThe note unspooled into other notes, thin silver threads. Tam dropped the shag bag. She put both hands to her ears, eyes gone bright and wet. Twenty miles away, I learned later, a man kneeling on a cheap laminate kitchen floor still wearing his fast-food visor began to weep and couldn\u2019t stop. He had been dead for nineteen years. He was a vampire.\n\nThere had always been vampires. Not the old story: cloaks and crumbling castles, not velvet-lined coffins bought at estate sales. Ours were ordinary. They used bleach. They cut their hair with kitchen scissors. They paid for parking and fought with their phones. They left you alone mostly. Not always\u2014once, long ago, in desire or hunger, they had not. But by the time I was a teenager they were part of the weather. They worked double shifts. They sat on bus benches and read the same paper as us. They smelled faintly of old coins and rain.\n\nThe choir happened at 3:16 a.m. in some countries and at lunchtime in others and at exactly in the middle of your nap wherever you were, because that\u2019s how fate arranges itself, with rudeness. Every vampire I\u2019ve ever known fell to his knees or her knees or their knees. They shed their bodies like jackets and rose into a light that made noise. I say rose, but it was less physical than that, more like they remembered a note and chased it up. Held together by mathematics and grief, they were new things. Not winged men. Not cherubs. Not anything that would fit inside a church painting. They were angles and brightness and attention. They were angels because we needed a word.\n\nWe called it the Turning because we turn things that change\u2014soil, pages, faces toward the light.\n\nThe first one I saw came from the pro shop. He had been working there for years, a quiet, mostly-silent man named colin in lower-case because he hated his name and refused to give it the dignity of capitals. For a decade he\u2019d measured out soft spikes and glove sizes. I brought him muffins on Mondays because I suspected he had no one else who did. He had been a vampire, though I didn\u2019t know that then, until he crumpled behind the counter, the flimsy plexiglass register guard trembling after he was already not-there. What rose from him was a geometry of light that touched the ceiling, the racks of branded polos, a jar of tees with tongue-in-cheek slogans I never bought. It touched me. On my right cheek. The way my mother\u2019s hand used to, absent and exact, while looking the other way toward a pot on the stove. Its touch was a measurement, a line from me to some unknown apex. It burned just enough to wake up a piece of me that had been drowsy all this time.\n\nTam said, \u201cRhea, your face.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lit like you\u2019re radiating from inside out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I said, but I was.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think he was one,\u201d she said, looking at colin\u2019s holiday mug, last year\u2019s cabernet shopping list in his half-printed half-cursive stuck under a magnet shaped like a golfing koala. \u201cI didn\u2019t think any of them still were.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not anymore,\u201d I said.\n\nWe walked out under a sky that had become a bowl of ringing notes. People were emerging onto their porches, some in slippers, some tugging at their sleeves as if to wake up. A maintenance guy dropped a rake that had been patched with duct tape. The head pro, gray-bearded and unapproachable as a granite hill, stood in the doorway like a picture of someone waiting for a bus that would never arrive. All over the river and the city beyond, pinpoints of rising light. On the news a woman tried to keep her eyes on the camera while looking past it at something above her that made her mouth make an O and stay that way.\n\nAnd in that shimmering, in the glissade of breathless hours after the Turning, the old maps curled and peeled and there was a new, impossible atlas beneath. The club members, the early risers with their range tokens and their complicated wives, knelt experimentally, as if praying would please the new weather. A teenager vaped and forgot, smoke pouring like a small personal fog as he stared upward. In the corner of the putting green, a cluster of six angel-shapes hovered like a bouquet of night-blooming plants. They didn\u2019t touch the ground but the grass under them was pressed down as if by a good, heavy snow.\n\nIt smelled like ozone, like fresh water poured into old holes.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go near,\u201d Tam said. Her hands were fists in her pockets.\n\nI did, because I had always lacked that part of the brain that believes warnings are anything other than metaphors. A bright figure uncurled toward me. When they talk about angels in old books, the writers often get shy and resort to obscurity. I used to think that was because the writers were cowards; now I know it\u2019s because there aren\u2019t words for some of it. This one had an outline, if by outline you mean the idea of an outline, and the idea suggested was \u201chuman.\u201d A suggestion of shoulders, a suggestion of teeth that were not teeth. A brightness that would be searing if you hated yourself, but if you didn\u2019t, was bearable. In that brightness a shadow like a bruise moved, slow as a cloud.\n\n\u201cRhea Moss,\u201d it said, although it didn\u2019t speak.\n\nI nodded as if to a starter before the horn. Because when a new thing has your name in its mouth, you nod. You pretend you expected it.\n\n\u201cYou used to\u2014\u201d I started.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d it said. Or sang. Or arranged the air so that yes was what I heard. A voice like a hole cut in the fabric of a lie.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want,\u201d I said, which was not what I meant. What I meant was, Who are you now. What I meant was, Is this why you liked watching me putt. What I meant was, Do you love me.\n\n\u201cI was called Velez,\u201d it said. Not its real name, of course. A name used like a shirt. The vampire I had met once in an alley behind the course seven years before. It had been a hot night and I was waiting for Tam to return with the car. My second-hand bag was leaning against the dumpster. The alley belonged to grease, to two green-tinted fluorescent lights, to the dumpster lid that never closed all the way. Velez had stepped from behind an exhaust pipe as if unspooling from a smell. Tall then. Narrow face. Bleached hair done badly. Thirsty eyes, but controlled, like a dancer watching whose hand holds the blade. He had said, \u201cYou swing like you can hear things.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can hear my coach yelling inside my head,\u201d I\u2019d said. He had smiled without teeth. He had watched me for a while and then said nothing and then, with the exact sadness of someone leaving the opera before the last act, he had left.\n\n\u201cIt was you,\u201d I said now.\n\n\u201cIt is I,\u201d the angel said.\n\nI hadn\u2019t had enough coffee for this. My palms itched. In the pro shop, colin\u2019s mug still steamed with whatever tea he liked. Outside, a woman in black leggings stopped mid-run and lifted her hands to the air, as if to catch a ball no one had thrown.\n\n\u201cThis is\u2026 good,\u201d I said, because a person needs a stance at the start of a very long, very strange day.\n\n\u201cThis is not simple,\u201d the angel said gently. Every light in it quivered. \u201cWe are not what people think we are. The word will help, and also it will not.\u201d\n\nTam clanked a club in the bag, a little warning. She does that when she wants me to retreat. A code we\u2019ve developed like birds. The angel turned its attention to her without looking. Her cap trembled.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want with me,\u201d I said again, being the sort of person who repeats the true question awhile until it gives up its secrets.\n\n\u201cYour game is a way to talk about other things,\u201d Velez said.\n\n\u201cThat sounds like a fortune cookie.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou aim at quiet and you make it with motion.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting weird,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cEverything is odd, now,\u201d it said, almost apologizing for the world.\n\nAngels were filling the day like a tide. On the television in the clubhouse, somebody had turned on the news and it showed footage of a hospital in Nairobi where a nurse screamed and then knelt and then laughed, showing a gap between her front teeth. In front of the hospital, an angel hovering near the jacaranda tree turned the purple blossoms into a cascade of honey bees, but the bees did not sting. They spelled something in the air in a language only the tree understood.\n\nTam said, \u201cWe should go.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo where.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo your apartment,\u201d she said, as if it were a fort.\n\nI watched another angel tilt itself toward the river, light sliding off the water, making everything too real, cruelly precise. \u201cWe can,\u201d I said, but I didn\u2019t move.\n\nVelez\u2014no longer Velez but for convenience we used the old shirts we had\u2014folded more brightness around itself until it looked less like ten thousand prisms and more like one thing. \u201cThere is a set of questions that will rearrange themselves around you,\u201d it said. \u201cStand there. Let them do the rearranging.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I supposed to do something,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou are going to have to decide something that no living person has decided,\u201d the angel said. \u201cBut not today. Today put the clubs in the trunk. Drink water. When you talk, do it like a person who remembers the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cDecide what,\u201d Tam said darkly. \u201cDecide between what and what.\u201d\n\nThe angel lifted its non-face toward the treeline as if listening to a far-away train. \u201cHeat,\u201d it said softly. \u201cCold. Staying. Leaving. There are planets in need of names.\u201d\n\nI laughed. It wasn\u2019t a pretty laugh. It was sharp and too loud in the morning air. \u201cWe can\u2019t even land a par on the third when the wind is up,\u201d I said. \u201cNow planets.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are a person with a driver in your hand who understands distance,\u201d the angel said. \u201cYou are a person who has stood in crowds and not lost the thread of your own breath. That is a kind of leadership. It\u2019s the beginning of one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a golfer,\u201d I said, suddenly angry for no good reason, because that was the thing I was and I had made peace with how small it was. \u201cI hit a ball with a stick and then chase it and hit it again, and sometimes people clap because the angle of my wrist is consistent over time. That\u2019s all. Don\u2019t turn it into a metaphor to make me feel better about this,\u201d I said, and surprised myself by sounding like my mother, who never got the hang of the internet and had made peace with that too.\n\nVelez\u2019s brightness dimmed and then deepened like breathing. \u201cIt will not feel better,\u201d it said. \u201cAnd we are not here to philosophize. We cannot lead you. You would not survive our leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why talk,\u201d Tam said.\n\n\u201cBecause we can tell you where not to step,\u201d it said, and for a moment there was a shadow in it like old shame. \u201cBecause we can sing to you about what we did wrong.\u201d\n\nAcross the fairway, a tall shape moved. At first I thought it was the head pro finally coming to tell us to clear out, that even in apocalypse there were things to be done. But it was a woman in a dark suit, shoes ungrassy. She hurried toward us with a face like the sky right before hail.\n\n\u201cMoss?\u201d she said, out of breath.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, because I was still me.\n\nShe held out a badge that meant nothing to me. Script letters, a seal with a ship. How many seals we invent to keep ourselves from drowning in each other\u2019s doubt. \u201cMinister Holm,\u201d she said. \u201cInterim\u2026 Well. None of that matters. I coordinate the city\u2019s emergency response.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat must be going well,\u201d Tam said, because fear shortens her fuse and sharpens her jokes to needles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Holm said. She was sweating through her collar. \u201cYou were named.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody named me,\u201d I said. \u201cI had a nickname once, but\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cJust now. On Channel 4. On God knows how many channels,\u201d she said. \u201cIn a statement made by\u2014\u201d She looked sideways at Velez, and her eyes did a strange thing, a hardness like a skin pulled tight over them. \u201cBy one of those. It said your actual name. It said to begin by finding you. It said, \u2018Tell Rhea Moss what we told you to tell her.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an absent pronoun,\u201d I said, as if that was the point.\n\nHolm\u2019s mouth made a line. \u201cI have a team. Scientists. Linguists. A person who studies\u2014\u201d She gestured helplessly at Velez. \u201cMy sister is at St. Agnes and she has not stopped crying since five-forty a.m. Also one of my dogs is floating four inches off the tile and won\u2019t come down. We are not okay. Will you come with me. Please.\u201d\n\nTam stepped forward, between me and Holm with the ease of a guard. \u201cTo do what,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTo be debriefed and then briefed,\u201d Holm said. \u201cTo ask questions. To listen. To tell us what the thing told you five seconds ago.\u201d\n\nVelez made a sound like a bell shaken and then gripped in a hand. \u201cGo,\u201d it said to me. \u201cI cannot protect you on the ground. But I can stand nearby in the air. It\u2019s not nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean you can hover and look majestic,\u201d Tam said.\n\n\u201cAmong other things,\u201d it said mildly. \u201cWe are newly made. We do not understand our limits yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Holm said, and for a moment I saw past the minister to the person who had eaten toast this morning quickly, without tasting, while the radio mispronounced its fear at her. She had a faint glitter at her collarbone, sweat or tears. I\u2019ve never liked being told what to do. But I also know when first practice is over and it\u2019s time to tee off.\n\nI tossed Tam the keys. \u201cBring the bag,\u201d I said. \u201cAll of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of it?\u201d\n\n\u201cEven the putter I hate.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hate all of them at some point,\u201d she muttered, but she hoisted the bag and followed.\n\nWe drove in Holm\u2019s car, a black thing with too many dials, through a city we knew but didn\u2019t. Clouds threw themselves apart. People were hugging at crosswalks. A man pushed a piano from a storefront onto the sidewalk and played it very badly and with great seriousness, as if to see if music still worked. Above us, angels flickered like strange birds in a storm. In the rearview I watched one dip low over a nursing home and then lift, and as it lifted, several windows opened at once from the inside, hands reaching into the air as if it were velvet, as if one might catch a bit and keep it in a drawer.\n\n\u201cWhat did it say,\u201d Holm said into the windshield.\n\n\u201cIt said my name,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI heard,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt said I should drink water,\u201d I said, because the least important things sometimes feel like the anchors.\n\n\u201cI can get you water,\u201d Holm said, and we all laughed, the brittle kind. I looked at Tam and saw that her eyes had that wild wetness I fear: the one that means, If you try to leave me, I\u2019ll turn into a map of your leaving and thus you will never be lost and thus you will always be wrong. I nodded to her, the kind of nod that says it all without explaining anything: stay, go, breathe, I don\u2019t know.\n\nWe arrived at an ugly building that had been ugly before the Turning and would be ugly after any apocalypse. Inside was a room with a table, and in the room were people who looked like they had not slept and were brimming with more words than they knew where to put. Dr. Sana Ortega introduced herself while putting her hair up with a pencil. Her eyes were like cut wood. She shook my hand dryly and didn\u2019t let go too long. \u201cYou were named,\u201d she said, as if we both needed to practice saying it.\n\n\u201cWe keep saying that,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the kind of day where we repeat nouns,\u201d she said. \u201cSit. This is\u2014\u201d She pointed: a linguist named Dana who wore earplugs although it was quiet; a physicist who introduced himself as Kit and then immediately corrected that to Kieran and then laughed as if that mattered to how matter behaves; a city council person who had been recently promoted without wanting to; a priest who was not in collar and whose eyes were red rimmed; two interns who looked like they\u2019d grown three inches this morning.\n\nThe screen on the wall showed faces from other rooms. This is the decade of faces being rectangles stacked in other rectangles. They looked at me too hard. I looked back because that\u2019s a skill you learn when people look at you to figure out who they should be.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Sana said. \u201cTell us. Don\u2019t worry about whether you\u2019re making sense. The truth will sort itself. It usually does, not fast enough.\u201d\n\nI said nothing at first. I was thinking of the first time I held a driver as a kid and realized that this was a stick that could erase and invent.\n\n\u201cIt knew my name,\u201d I said. \u201cIt said we\u2019re going to have to \u2018decide something no one alive has decided.\u2019 It mentioned planets. It told me to drink water.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlanets,\u201d Kieran said. \u201cPlural.\u201d\n\nI nodded.\n\n\u201cDo you think\u2014\u201d Dana started, and then put a hand in the air. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask it badly. Do you think they mean we should see other planets, like tour them, or that we should live there.\u201d\n\n\u201cColonize,\u201d the priest said grimly, and then flinched at the word as if it had bitten him. \u201cIs that the word we\u2019re using again.\u201d\n\nSana leaned forward. \u201cWe knew something was coming,\u201d she said. \u201cOther than this, I mean. Seismic weirdness. The glacier data. The slow roll of ocean heat. There have been nights lately where the stars looked\u2014wrong. Or too vivid. Or too arranged.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr like the paintings you\u2019d see in dentist offices,\u201d Dana said. \u201cThe ones with the wet road at night and just a little bit of tail lights\u2014\u201d She looked abashed at the analogy. \u201cSorry. There\u2019s no real language.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf everything is still, it\u2019s only because the mechanism has become a wheel,\u201d the priest murmured, as if reciting.\n\n\u201cThey told us,\u201d Holm said, and her voice hopped like a windy umbrella. \u201cThey told us on the broadcast that the Earth is ending.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefine ending,\u201d I said, and heard my own voice sound like a hollow object.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to,\u201d Sana said, and rubbed the pencil through her hair and made a mess. \u201cIn how many days, months\u2014? They were very bad with the number. The number was spoken and then sung and then shown as an image of a hand closing and then as a shadow moving across cress. We\u2019re translating across forms. But roughly. Roughly. Two and a half years.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlenty of time,\u201d Kieran said, and then covered his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cApology accepted as soon as I figure out who is owed it,\u201d Holm said.\n\nWe sat there. Sometimes the sitting is the work. Tam, at the back of the room, leaned against the wall and stared at the ceiling like she could see into the floor above. I thought of my apartment\u2019s plant, a rubber plant that refuses to die, proof that some things like neglect. I thought of my mother, who used to stand in the kitchen after doing the dishes and stare at nothing, not because she was contemplating death but because if she put down the dish towel she would not know what to do with her hands. I thought of a map of the night sky pinned above my teenage bed, a poster someone gave me free at the planetarium that I kept because it glowed.\n\n\u201cWhy me,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m nobody. I\u2019m good at something that mattered yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really think that,\u201d Sana said. It wasn\u2019t a question.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t not think it,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked my whole life to be good at playing a game. That\u2019s not nothing. But it\u2019s also not telling a million people where to put their bodies so they don\u2019t die.\u201d\n\nTam said, \u201cMaybe they don\u2019t want a leader who likes pointing. Maybe they want someone who gestures.\u201d\n\nIn the corner of the room, as if called by being discussed, a softness brightened, and Velez entered without using the door. Holm flinched, and then pretended she hadn\u2019t by adjusting her shoe. Sana took a deep breath in and out. I watched the intern\u2019s face do the kind of joy that makes you suspicious of your own bones.\n\n\u201cWe cannot say you are nobody,\u201d Velez said. \u201cThat would be an unkindness to language. You are Rhea Moss. In certain games people whisper your name like a place they went once that they didn\u2019t want to leave.\u201d\n\nNobody moved. The building\u2019s vents hummed a low, tired note. Outside, a siren tried to keep doing the job it once had.\n\n\u201cYou would like us to choose someone else,\u201d Velez said, its voice almost amused. \u201cYou have never wanted the microphone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like microphones because they make my own voice sound like a person I would not follow,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t lead the world,\u201d I added, hearing the absurdity and wanting to hold it like a pet. \u201cI can\u2019t even finish a round sometimes when my own breathing goes weird.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can because you must and you will hate it,\u201d the angel said. \u201cBut hate is not a disqualifier. Sometimes it is a kind of faith.\u201d\n\nSana glanced at me with eyes that flickered like candlelight. \u201cIf this were a movie,\u201d she said, \u201cthis is the scene where you say no three times and then fate conspires to yes. But I don\u2019t think this is a movie. I think we all have to be wrong and keep going.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do the angels want,\u201d the priest asked Velez. \u201cReally. Not the soft version. The sharp one.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be forgiven,\u201d Velez said without hesitation. The room exhaled, a sound like a seabird giving up. \u201cTo witness. To sing so a thing doesn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s an ugly word. A folding. The world will crease along a line we cannot smooth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of line,\u201d Kieran asked, for whom lines were everything.\n\n\u201cImagine paper,\u201d the angel said. \u201cThen imagine it learning about wet. Then imagine a hand wanting a boat without knowing how to float. It folds. The paper is still paper. It is a boat now. But the water is the law, and law is not sentimental. We cannot force the float.\u201d\n\nHolm made a sound, not laughter. \u201cThat was approximate as hell,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I understood it anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Velez said. \u201cWe will be imprecise and we will still arrive at true.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo planets,\u201d Sana said briskly, pulling us back from metaphor like pulling a dog from a river. \u201cDo you have coordinates. Are there ships. Do you carry them inside your\u2014\u201d She gestured at the angel as if there might be a pocket.\n\n\u201cWe have the songs of places,\u201d Velez said. \u201cThink of them as addresses. We do not have ships. We are the opposite of a ship. We resist shape.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have rockets,\u201d Kieran said, then winced. \u201cI mean. We have\u2026 a few. We have budgets that were not approved. We have plans with corners missing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have nothing,\u201d Holm said, and this time it was not despair but the bluntness of someone taking stock.\n\n\u201cNot nothing,\u201d Tam said from the wall, and I wanted to kiss her for that. \u201cWe have hands. We have people who go out when it rains with buckets and try. You can do more than you think if your shoulder remembers the angle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is insane,\u201d I said, finally. \u201cNo one is going to listen to a golfer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will listen to you because we say so,\u201d Velez said, and I hated the way my stomach roiled at the thought. \u201cThat is the worst reason for someone to listen, but sometimes it is the only one that works long enough to find a better one.\u201d\n\nLater, after too many forms were printed and then abandoned, after an intern brought me water in a paper cup and cried when I thanked him for a small thing, after Sana scrawled on the whiteboard until the pen squealed, we went back to the course. It had become a place people came to because they needed a place to stand. The grass had never been so trampled by sneakers. Someone had set a bowl of fruit on the starter\u2019s table, as if to feed a god. The angels huddled in groups, superficially like birds at a pond, actually not like anything at all.\n\nVelez hovered over the seventeenth because it is a hole I have always loved: a dogleg with a stupid bunker that bullies me. Evening came down the way a parent comes down the stairs after a too-long silence: suspicious of joy. People sat on their heels or their hope. The tree line stood still. A woman with a baby at her chest rocked and hummed, and the baby watched her mother\u2019s mouth out of the corner of his eye, as if it were the moon.\n\nOn the tee box, the air changed pressure. If this sounds like a lie, it is because language doesn\u2019t have braille for it yet. Ears popped. The hair on arms shook awake. Above us assembled a shape that was a choir. Not one angel, not fifty, a formation like a swarm caught in decision. They made a low sound and it scraped gooseflesh up spine bones and all the memories that lived there uninvited.\n\nThey said, without sound, in a way that made children hear it as lullaby and scientists hear it as a data dump: We have been made new and we are not your judges. We have been made from your dark things and our dark things and we will pretend not to be bad at pretending. We have three things.\n\nOne: A sentence that cannot be unmade. The world will fold. You cannot stop it with repentance, with money, with a clever hinge. Some of you will think you can. That thought will be useful, briefly, in that it will produce energy. Harness it with kindness. Do not let it turn you cruel.\n\nTwo: Songs of other places where your bodies could learn to breathe. We cannot guarantee a life there. We cannot guarantee anything. We can tell you where the ground says yes when paired with the right boots.\n\nThree: Names. Names are how you begin. One of the names is Rhea Moss.\n\nI wanted to look behind me and see if there was someone else. Wanting that was like wanting backward rain.\n\nThey called my name a second time and the sound of it made me an infant and an old woman at once. Time buckled. I thought of the first time I read the rule book and realized the rules were less about behaving than about agreeing where the lines were so we could invent them again together the next Sunday.\n\nWe will speak to your leaders. We will not choose them for you. We will not stop your wars. We will sing outside the door while you wrestle and bribe and cry and cut and forgive. We say the name so that the room remembers a different shape it could take.\n\nThe baby at the woman\u2019s chest hiccuped as if something delighted him. It was absurd. It was perfect.\n\nSomeone behind me said, too loud, \u201cShe plays a game,\u201d and someone else said, \u201cExactly,\u201d and it made my throat close.\n\nVelez drifted nearer until the brightness washed my hands and made the veins in them map-blue. I imagined every blister I\u2019d ever had, all the small pains that had kept me awake at night, and thought, If all the pains in the world were put in order from smallest to largest, where would mine live. The answer did not matter. But asking was a kind of worship.\n\n\u201cWe will give you the song now,\u201d the choir said, and they poured a sequence into the air. It was at once a sound and a temperature. It smelled like the inside of a clean ceramic mug, like wet bark cut by a pocket knife, like pennies and peach skin. It was coordinates if coordinates were a lullaby. Later, Kieran would sit with it and transcribe and cry and then wipe his face and laugh and then cough, bent over, as if clearing a pipe. For now it was just the feeling of a far-off lake in summer where the mosquitoes had agreed to leave you alone one blessed evening and you didn\u2019t question it.\n\nI understood nothing and everything. The green trembled under my shoes. The bunker waited with its old patience. The angels finished. The crowd did not clap. We stood in a silence that was not silence; it was something packed, a held breath in the body of the city.\n\nThen everyone did the thing you do at weddings, at airports, at funerals. They began to speak at once about practicalities that had nothing and everything to do with the biggest thing. Did you bring sunscreen. Does the bus even run now. How is your mother. My phone is dead. Where will we put the people who had planned to be buried when the ground is planning to be water. Do you believe any of this. I can\u2019t feel my teeth. No, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine. We will remember how to be good.\n\nTam tugged my sleeve. \u201cHey,\u201d she said softly.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. My voice was lost somewhere between here and tomorrow.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to do this,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what the this is. But I know I\u2019m going to be there when you do it or don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d I said, trying to smile. \u201cYou\u2019ll end up giving speeches and you hate microphones more than I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll stand behind you and hold your jacket so you don\u2019t do that thing where you hunch,\u201d she said, and she made the shape of the hunch with her body and for a second we were just us, and the word planetary didn\u2019t have anywhere to land near our shoes.\n\nThe air smelled like rain though the forecast had been clear. Every forecast would be wrong now, permanently.\n\nAt home that night, my sibling Jun called. On the screen he looked like a face that was trying not to be a face: eyes smudged, hair with that roof-lift look of someone who had been running their hands through it. He is younger than me by seven years and he is, often, smarter.\n\n\u201cRhee,\u201d he said. He calls me that when he wants me to know he is in the room emotionally even if he is not. \u201cWhat is happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething big and something little,\u201d I said. \u201cNone of them our fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cried in the grocery store\u2019s canned beans aisle,\u201d he said. \u201cA woman I didn\u2019t know handed me a lemon. We both looked at it like it was a bomb and then laughed. Is this what we are now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we have always been also this,\u201d I said. \u201cJust less lit from the side.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re on the internet,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re a meme. They\u2019ve photoshopped you into every painting with an angel. Even the ugly ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m spectacular under oil paint,\u201d I said, because it was the smallest joke I could manage.\n\nJun swallowed. \u201cThey picked you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey said my name,\u201d I said truthfully.\n\n\u201cYou can do it,\u201d he said, as if what it was were a party trick. \u201cYou practice in the rain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want me to help everyone move house,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big house.\u201d\n\nJun\u2019s face did a thing like he had breathed in too much night air. \u201cMom would have\u2014\u201d he began and stopped.\n\n\u201cMom would have made sandwiches,\u201d I said. \u201cBig ones. And then worried about the mustard stain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014 I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do. I can make spreadsheets. I can drive. I can fetch. I can hold water while someone drinks it and not make it about me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe safe,\u201d I said, which is the lie we tell because we need the shape of it between us and the cliff.\n\nAfter we hung up, I sat at the small table that was not designed for destiny and put my head down on its warm, soft wood. The rubber plant leaned toward me like a bad actor and then remembered to be a plant. Out the window the city did what cities do: flickered between panic and joking, between siren and shuffle, between singing and sleep. Somewhere, someone was making a chart with a pencil that had a bite mark on it. Somewhere an angel was telling a child that none of this was a punishment, though some would want to make it one. Somewhere the men who had always loved weapons were polishing them with the kind of care they never gave their own bones.\n\nMy phone pinged with a message from an unknown number:\n\nMy father says hello. He was a patient of yours. At night. By the range. He says your swing made a sound he thought he\u2019d never hear again. He says thank you. Also. He says sorry.\n\nI put the phone face down on the table and watched the little light pulse for longer than was useful. The angels were above the city in their assembly language. The golfers of the world were arguing in comment sections. The dogs were confused. The cats were pretending it had all been their idea.\n\nIt would be a while before I slept. And when I did, I dreamt of a fairway as wide as a desert and a flag made of starlings and a bunker filled with salt. In the dream my father, who had never cared for golf because he thought it was for people who had too much time, stood beside me holding a measuring tape that unspooled and unspooled and never found an end.\n\nI woke to the sound of morning news like always, except the newsreader\u2019s voice broke when she said the word ordinary. The city\u2019s mayor had made a statement; it had said exactly what statements say and nothing of what they mean. The President had tweeted and then deleted the tweet. A preacher somewhere had told his congregation that they were chosen because they had prayed louder than other congregations and then his wife had hiccuped loudly into the microphone and the choir had laughed and the laughing had saved them from themselves for four minutes.\n\nThe angels at dawn made a shape over the river that was maybe a map and maybe a warning. Velez hovered outside my window like a bad idea or a brave one.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said into the glass, my breath making a cloud that vanished too fast. \u201cHere we go.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d he agreed. \u201cWe go,\u201d and then he told me the first of the songs again because I had forgotten it already, and because forgetting is the ocean and remembering is the shore and you can stand between them only for a while without being changed.\n\nPeople knock on doors when they are asking for signatures to get onto ballots. They knock on doors when they are selling magazine subscriptions you forgot were still a thing. They knock on doors when they have come to ask for help or to apologize. That morning the knock on mine was careful, no urgency, no apology, and it said: opportunity, inevitability, both.\n\nI opened it to find Minister Holm holding a stack of papers and a pen that had viscera on it from being bitten. Sana was behind her with a thermos that said COFFEE in a documentary font. Tam leaned in the hallway like a guardian whose sword was sarcasm. And over them, like a lampshade on the very idea of us, Velez.\n\n\u201cWe need to write a speech,\u201d Holm said, swallowing. \u201cAnd by we, I mean you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can be short,\u201d Sana added, because she is a blessing. \u201cIt can be just: Hello. I am a person. We have a plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a plan,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWe will have one by the time you get to the words about the plan,\u201d she said. \u201cStart the sentence. The sentence will grow around it.\u201d\n\nI looked at the papers and saw that all of them had my name on them in typefaces that tried to be serious. \u201cDo I have to wear a suit,\u201d I said, and for the first time since the Turning I heard my own voice sound like I liked it.\n\n\u201cYou can wear exactly what you were going to wear,\u201d Tam said, and I looked down and saw that I was wearing the hoodie with the frayed cuff and pants with a grass stain that had refused bleach like a stubborn saint. \u201cIt\u2019s not a fashion show. It\u2019s the end of the world,\u201d she said, and then caught herself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d I said. \u201cTrue things don\u2019t need apologizing, just handling.\u201d\n\nAnd that was how it began. Not with trumpets. With a tee time no one wanted but which, having been found on the schedule, we could not ignore. With a woman from the city who had given up on her dogs touching the floor and with a scientist who believed that if you put enough graphs under enough light they would become a hallway. With my caddie, who knew when my hands were lying. With an angel who had once taught me how not to be afraid of my own wrists in the moonlight. With paper. With water. With a small word at the start of a large sentence, and with the knowledge that there were planets in the dark with our possible names hanging over them like unripe fruit, that someday maybe we\u2019d bite into and wince and keep eating anyway.\n\nI wrote the first words down. I crossed them out. I wrote them again.\n\nHello. I am a person. We have a plan.",

Holm spread the papers like a card trick she didn\u2019t believe in. Sana set down her thermos and unscrewed the lid with that scientific precision that makes you trust a person with hard news. Tam stood behind my chair, arms crossed, using posture like armor. Velez hovered in a way that would have been theatrical if theater had ever been that specific about light. The rubber plant leaned toward the scene, performing curiosity. I had slept an hour and a half and it had been full of numbers without units.\n\n\u201cSay it like you mean it,\u201d Holm said, as if meaning were something you could pour into the hollow of a syllable and trust it to set. \u201cSay it like you are not asking for permission.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am asking for permission,\u201d I said. \u201cFrom everybody. To be in their heads with my voice for five minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen ask like you know they\u2019ll grant it,\u201d Sana said. She slid a pen across the table and it made that soft whisper that pens make when they want to be useful. \u201cWe can\u2019t script a day. We can script a first breath. Start with the small words. They hang better.\u201d\n\nI wrote, slowly because speed feels like lying when your hand isn\u2019t sure, Hello. I am a person. We have a plan. The words looked like they\u2019d been caught in the act of being, half naked. I stared at them until they were just shapes and then I looked away so they could be words again. Tam reached over my shoulder and tugged my hoodie hood so it lay flat and didn\u2019t make me look hunched. Sometimes her caretaking irritates me the way gravel irritates an oyster. Sometimes it makes pearls out of my day.\n\n\u201cTone?\u201d Holm asked the ceiling, because sometimes you ask a roof for what you want from a crowd. \u201cNo miracles. No beautiful suffering. Practical hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I talk about buckets,\u201d I said, \u201cwill they think I\u2019m making fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about buckets, they\u2019ll think you\u2019ve never been to a flooded basement,\u201d Tam said. \u201cSay the thing with the word that fits in a coat pocket. Nothing with wings. We\u2019re full up on wings.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell them the number,\u201d Sana said quietly. \u201cNot the precise one. The true one. Two and a half years is a long time and no time. They need to feel both.\u201d\n\nVelez dimmed and brightened like a creature remembering that it was also an equation. \u201cSay that we will be wrong,\u201d it said. \u201cSay that wrong is a path if you keep walking and don\u2019t build a house there.\u201d\n\nI wrote that down even though I hated it. I hate it when a thing that sounds like a fortune cookie is also the only thing there is to say.\n\nWe argued about the third paragraph the way you argue about whether to take a five iron or a six when the wind is doing a small dishonest thing. Holm wanted a list because lists calm people who are addicted to chaos. Sana wanted a story because stories give chaos a chair. Tam wanted a promise that we would not build a fence and then only open it for the prettiest. I wanted to stand very still until the responsibility slid off my shoulders like rain. Velez wanted us to explain that angels would not be in charge under any circumstances because power loves a costume and theirs glowed too much.\n\n\u201cTell them about the hubs,\u201d Holm said finally, the word coming out as if it had grown teeth on the way. \u201cSchools. Gyms. Churches. Community centers with roofs we know the names of. If you tell them where to go tomorrow, they\u2019ll sleep tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a plan for those yet,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWe do by the time you say the word hubs,\u201d Sana said. \u201cWe have a hundred clipboards and a million hands. That is plan shaped. The rest is hinges.\u201d\n\nWe practiced. Practice is how I have tricked my own fear for years, making it believe it is seeing the thing twice when it is only seeing the thing once with a rehearsal stitched to it. I stood beside my kitchen counter and held a wooden spoon because microphones are just fancier spoons. Tam made me pause between sentences the way she makes me breathe over a putt. Holm timed me with a watch that looked expensive and cheap at once, like a politician. Sana filmed and winced and then said the word good as if it were a rare material. Velez did not speak, which was also a kind of speaking.\n\nThey took me to the municipal building that had always pretended to be a temple without being one. Steps. Flags. A broad square that had seen protests and farmers\u2019 markets and a meatball tasting contest that went to fistfights. The air had a clarity that scared me. There is a way the day looks when something has just died, even if you can\u2019t yet say what. The square was newcomers to dawn: people holding handmade signs that did not demand so much as offer. WATER, one said. LISTEN, said another, as if it were a verb we could press into bricks. Someone had drawn an angel in sidewalk chalk and given it roller skates because kids know everything and spare you the explanation.\n\nThe platform looked like a cart without wheels. There were microphones clustered like flowers around a grave. Cameras perched like too-interested birds. Holm whispered to someone with a clipboard that looked like a passport to a place you wouldn\u2019t want to visit. The Mayor shook my hand and the shaking was actually a network of twitches that made a rhythm of panic through bone. A man with a priest\u2019s face but a carpenter\u2019s hands stood near the edge of the stage and looked at the crowd as if he\u2019d been asked to count them and couldn\u2019t because they were not rocks, they were water. Tam squeezed my shoulders, one then the other, in our old pattern: left for the body I have, right for the body I think I have.\n\nI stepped up and the crowd made the kind of sound crowds make when they don\u2019t know if they\u2019re about to be entertained or sent home. I put my hand on the wooden edge of the podium and thought of the grain of a driver, the way wood still remembers tree even when it\u2019s pretending to be equipment. Above us the angels had arranged themselves in a configuration I refused to call a halo. It was more like a mobile hung by a nervous parent over a crib, slightly off-center so it would spin slow.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d I said, and I made my voice walk instead of run. \u201cI am a person. We have a plan.\u201d\n\nThere is a kind of hush that is not silence but a gathering. It has weight. It pressed down over my scalp and made me feel like I had put my head under a tap. I took a breath to swallow it. I told them the number as a fact without embellishment. I said, \u201cTwo and a half years. That is enough time to do something human,\u201d and I watched people translate that word into their own kitchens.\n\nI talked about hubs like benches in a park where you go when you are lost or waiting for the person you love. I said, \u201cGo to the place with caged basketball hoops and melting red punch stains on the floor. Go to the place with a stage where the children once argued about who gets to be a tree. Go to the place with a freezer in the back that always squeals. If you don\u2019t know where that is, ask a kid. They always know.\u201d I told them to bring water and a notebook and the names of their elders and the medications in their cabinets and their recipes for cheap food that tastes rich. I said, \u201cBring a neighbor you are not sure you like. This will be the hardest part and the most important.\u201d\n\nI said that the angels were not kings. I said that they would sing and show us where not to step, and we would take the steps. The crowd looked up and I held their looking by naming the looking. I told them that power would try to dress itself in their fear and we should be generous without being stupid. I said that we would count and we would measure because numbers make bridges when spoken softly. I said that we would be wrong and we would not settle there.\n\nWhen I said the word planets out loud, a ripple went through the square like wind passing over scythed wheat. The word made some people look beautiful; it made others look murderous. I told them that planets was not a pretty word today, it was a shopping list word. I told them we would send instruments first because we are a species that pokes with sticks before putting our arms in, and that is wisdom. I said that if we went we would not do it like thieves in a museum, palming artifacts. We would bring seeds and apology. We would bring our bad jokes. We would bring the recipes we learned from a grandmother who never measured anything and still always made it taste like a story. We would ask permission. We would write our names in pencil.\n\nA shoe flew. It was a loafer with a heel worn thin on one side, and it went end-over-end like a coin trying to pretend to be an idea. It hit the podium, not me, and the applause that followed was not applause, it was the sound people make when an object falls and does not kill. Tam moved before I did, a swift, precise reconfiguration of body and intent, and she did not move toward the man because she does not believe in being a wall when you can be a door. She found his eyes. He was already crying because anger, too, is a salve for fear until it isn\u2019t. I said into the wide open sky, \u201cKeep throwing shoes if you have to; we\u2019ve all worn something that didn\u2019t fit,\u201d and a laugh rose like steam. It wasn\u2019t pretty. It was necessary. The man\u2019s shoulders dropped. He put his hands in his pockets and pulled them out empty as if to confess he had been hoping they were full all along.\n\nAfter that the words came easier because the hardest thing had already happened and I had not died. I told them when, where, how to gather. I told them to take their money out of mattresses only as far as to buy a hand-crank radio and dried beans, and then put the money back if they had any left because the future we are not yet in still needs buses and show tickets and tips. I told them we were not closing but opening, like a hand, and that opening would hurt because we had used those fingers to hold onto ourselves for so long. I told them what we needed: translators who like puzzles, engineers whose first tool was a coat hanger, nurses who can start IVs in rolling ambulances, kids who are good at finding batteries in drawers. I said, \u201cIf your specialty is cooling temper tantrums in grocery store aisles, bring that. If your specialty is coaxing seeds that look like commas into basil like paragraphs, bring that. If your specialty is apologizing to people you don\u2019t want to apologize to and meaning it, bring that twice.\u201d\n\nThe angels hummed in a way that did not ask for acknowledgment and got it anyway. When I ended, there was no crescendo. There was a wave of bodies turning to talk to other bodies, which is what happens when humans hear something that fits. We make group work out of it. A teen somewhere shouted, \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d and the crowd moved without stampeding, a miracle I will not claim credit for. Holm grabbed my elbow with the grip of a person clinging to a rope, and Sana pressed a thermos into my hand, and Tam exhaled so hard I felt it cool the edge of my jaw.\n\nThe next room after the square was a room that smelled like toner and worry. Tables. Maps. The maps were already wrong because the river was thinking about a new shape for itself like a child thinking about telling a lie. Holm had people moving pushpins like prayers. Sana was already on the phone with a glacier in another time zone. The linguist, Dana, slid up with a sheaf of music paper she had stolen from a marching band closet. She had translated pieces of the songs the angels gave us into notation that looked like something you\u2019d play only if you wanted your instrument to develop opinions. Kieran rolled in a whiteboard and wrote on it with a marker that squealed until he apologized to it under his breath.\n\n\u201cWe can build a chamber,\u201d he said, to no one and everyone. \u201cNot a portal. An ear. A room that is a bell. We ring the song and see what listens. If the air presses or the temperature hums a notch sideways, if a smell no one remembers naming opens, we write that down. We don\u2019t put anybody in there. We don\u2019t put a bug in there. We put metal and math. I take that back; we put a leaf in there because leaves are brave.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn ear,\u201d Sana said, liking it. \u201cEars we can make. Ears we can build in basements if we have to. Ears don\u2019t require a vote from a budget committee. Ears become maps.\u201d\n\nVelez straightened imperceptibly, a geometry hearing a metaphor it could occupy. \u201cDo not make a mouth by accident,\u201d it said. \u201cDo not make a door that swings only one way. We will sing you away from that kind of hinge if you listen.\u201d\n\nHolm wrote HUBS on a whiteboard with a slash between the letters, as if making the word into a command. Underneath she wrote a list so plain it could have been a grocery list: Water. Food. Shade. Heat. Power, ankle height first. People who know the block. Wheelchairs. Insulin. Whistles. Tape. Pens that write upside down. Dignity, underlined twice even though she may have meant it as a joke. I watched people bring their own handwriting to the table, hats still on because they forgot about their heads in the face of a larger one.\n\nI made a rule nobody asked me to make and then realized it was the only way I could stand to be in this kind of room. I said, \u201cNo acronyms,\u201d and Holm laughed and then put a line through a string of letters she had been composing. \u201cWe will lose people at the second capital,\u201d I said. \u201cWe will keep the doors open if each word fits inside the mouth of a person who hates meetings.\u201d\n\nJun arrived with a backpack that looked like it had been packed by a person who understands the difference between a hypothetical and a hallway. He brought lemons and index cards and tape with the good pull. He hugged me as if he were handing me a rope. His eyes were tenderized meat. \u201cI made a form,\u201d he said, not embarrassed because shame was suddenly too expensive. \u201cNames. Skills. The thing you do without thinking when your phone dies. The tallest thing you can carry down three flights of stairs without stopping. The name of the neighbor you\u2019d call at two a.m. If they don\u2019t have one, we help them find one.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a monster,\u201d I said, because sometimes you honor genius with a joke.\n\nHe set up at a corner table and became a lighthouse; people came and he turned their fear into lines in a spreadsheet that breathed. He asked them questions like a barber or a bartender or a rabbi, which is to say kindly and with a hand on the shoulder at the exact right second. He made eye contact the way you hold a nail while you hammer it.\n\nWe built the first ear in a drained community pool that had chipped blue paint the color of longing. The pool had resisted becoming a skate park for years and now it got to be something larger. Volunteers taped plastic across the windows until the room felt like inside a throat. We built a frame of pipe and tension cable and hung sheets welded with mesh and a material Sana called meta, as if we could better reality by saying the word out loud. We hung resonant plates we stole from a piano that had been left out on the sidewalk in the weather and refused to die. We borrowed microphones from the city\u2019s least-bad cover band and a speaker stack that teenagers had previously used to annoy their parents and now was asked to annoy the gap between worlds.\n\nDana stood in the center with a pitch pipe and a laptop that had survived three majors. She ran a hand through short hair and made a face like she was about to taste something sour on purpose. The angels ringed the rafters like sentences that hadn\u2019t found their verbs. Velez made a small motion with its width that I had learned was yes in angel. People in orange volunteer vests whispered to each other the way people speak at wakes.\n\n\u201cOn three,\u201d Dana said, and then didn\u2019t count because real beginnings never do. She lifted the pitch and the sound was small and real and human, the way a whistle is, the way a kettle is, the way a mother calling a kid who is just out of sight is. She braided in the next note and the next, and the chords didn\u2019t sound like chords until your ribs remembered something from any time you had ever been held. The sheets in the frame shook without moving. The temperature did something you could have written in a notebook if your notebook had a column for this next weather.\n\nIt smelled like pennies and peach skin and wet bark, which made the hair on my arms stand up because sometimes repetition is proof and sometimes it is warning. The blue paint on the pool wall looked greener for a second and then remembered what it was. Kieran watched a needle climb a gauge and then laughed at a spot on the curve that made him see an old friend. He whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s a reply,\u201d and then covered his mouth as if it were blasphemy to be that glad.\n\nWe did not put anything alive in the ear. We soldered a loop of wire and clipped it to a ring soaked in sugar water and watched the water bead and then fall in a pattern none of us had the math for. We rusted pieces of steel that had asked for it for years. We left a square of silk and it came back smelling like a bread we didn\u2019t know how to bake. We wrote everything down in three separate notebooks in three different hands because redundancy is a kind of faith.\n\nLater, in the ten o\u2019clock meeting\u2014or maybe it was the two; time was a sliding window\u2014I said the words no angels, no armies, not because I believed either could be banned but because I needed to hear them said near each other so we could feel the current that would jump between. A man in a uniform bristling with rectangles of color stood and tried to make a rectangle of me. He said chain of command and I said command makes chains if you forget why you needed the chain in the first place. He said contingency operation and I said waterline. He said triage and I said kids. He looked at Tam like he was trying to find permission and she looked at his boots and did not give it. Holm refused to be the kind of politician who uses words like partnership when she means oversight; she said, \u201cWe\u2019ll need trucks, Major. Not speeches,\u201d and to his credit the man nodded and left his rhetoric on the chair and went to find keys.\n\nThe names began as a rumor. The angels, in their awkward kindness, had brought a list of people who could hold two truths at once without dropping either. The list was not a hierarchy, it was a constellation. One name was a woman who taught dance in a rec center and repaired zippers between classes. One was a man who ran an after-hours soup line out of a legally ambiguous kitchen. One was a librarian who could make a room quiet without being cruel. There were not leaders the way we expect them; they were conduits. They were markers in the old sense: things you put down so you don\u2019t lose the way. The angels called them witnesses but we called them what we could live with. We called and they said yes the way people say yes to carrying a crate they have not looked inside yet.\n\nNights got bad around three a.m. when the city\u2019s hums thinned and your own thoughts made larger sounds. The angels sang outside my window and once a neighbor shouted Shut up because grief is not polite. I made notes on a pad beside the bed and woke to sentences that looked like somebody else\u2019s handwriting. Jun fell asleep at the kitchen table twice and once we just covered him with a coat and wrote around him. Tam would leave and come back with paper and salty snacks and the kind of milk that never goes bad and face wash, because two and a half years is a long time to be without good soap. Sana started using new words: resonance window, dampening, braid integrity. Holm learned the names of the night-shift janitors at City Hall and said them aloud so often you would think she was incanting, and maybe she was.\n\nI went back to the course when I shouldn\u2019t have, the way you go back to a place that used to be only yours in order to make a small bargain with yourself. The putting green was a study in footprints, foreign weights pressed into the soft. The sign warning about aeration looked like it was trying to apologize for all of creation. In the pro shop the counter still had the little paper basket of cheap tees with bad jokes printed on them like embarrassment. Colin\u2019s mug had gone cold and then dried and then acquired a ring that made me think about time in a way that made me want to sit down. I took the shopping list he\u2019d left under the magnet\u2014cabbage, rice, paper towels, something crossed off I can\u2019t read\u2014and stuck it in my pocket not because I wanted a relic but because this was how I could carry him. An angel touched my cheek and I felt the exact tenderness of someone adjusting a collar before you walk into a room you\u2019d hoped to avoid.\n\n\u201cTell me a thing I cannot know until later,\u201d I said to Velez outside, and he laughed without cruelty.\n\n\u201cOn a night you will not expect,\u201d it said, \u201cthe stars will look like they are turning backward. That is a fold rehearsal. Stay inside even if you think that is cowardice. Your breath will feel like it wants to run away. Hold it softly. If you must sing, sing to quiet your bones, not the sky.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat else,\u201d I said, because greed is not only for food and money; it is for certainty too.\n\n\u201cShips,\u201d it said, dimming. \u201cDo not build them with corners that hunger for status. You will be tempted to paint names on the sides before you know if they float. Paint the word try. Then paint nothing. Then send the first ones empty if you can. Do not strap the poor to a rocket and call it salvation. Do not strap the rich either and call it justice.\u201d\n\nThat night a man with a blowout haircut got on a television and said my name like it had cut him and he wanted to make it bleed. He said golfer like it was a slur. In the comment flood that I didn\u2019t read but felt across my skin anyway, people put me in every painting and on every cereal box and under every headline like glue. Jun printed the memes and taped them to the wall because he believes in demystifying joke ghosts. Tam drew mustaches on the cruelest ones because she believes in defacement as balm. I threw a paper plane of myself down the hallway and watched it crash into a pile of blankets and felt better than was logical.\n\nWe opened the first hub in the gym with the scuffed lines and the clock that had not worked in years but still presided like a judge pretending retirement. Volunteers in vests that matched nothing handed out clipboards and crayons and water. A woman with a beautiful face that had been stern for too long showed up with a bag of mismatched socks and became the sock person, which was not her destiny but it was her day. A boy crawled under the bleachers and came out with a kitten and a handful of broken wishes he blew at me like confetti. An old man stood at a corner table and sharpened pencils with a pocket knife, shavings like curled paper rain. A girl explained to her grandmother that the angels were not ghosts because ghosts do not smell like rain on pennies. A crew that had been a youth basketball team before their coach fell asleep sitting up made sandwiches with mustard like a deadline.\n\nThe Major came back with trucks and the stiff posture that says being told to help has injured something tender. Tam handed him a stack of clipboards without ceremony while Holm told him which door to guard and which to wedge open with a piece of wood because the wedge was missing. Sana set up a station for insulin like she had been born knowing where to put coolers so they don\u2019t trip anyone. Dana sat with a group of kids and showed them how to write the song shapes with crayons, not because they needed to but because doing a thing you can do with your hands near a thing you cannot do with your hands is medicine. The priest put a basket by the door and wrote on it in black marker FOR PHONES WHILE YOU CRY and people used it and nobody stole any and that made me believe in something I do not like to name.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clean. It wasn\u2019t orderly. It was a kind of music anyway. I stood on the stage and did not speak because the room did not need me to tell it what it was. A woman came up with a notebook already full because she is the sort of person who has been making hubs in her building since forever. She wanted a stamp. She wanted a version of official. I drew a small circle on her page with a smile inside it and she nodded and we both pretended it was a badge so we could keep walking.\n\nLate, after the chairs had been stacked by teenagers with energy like sparks, after the floors had been swept with push brooms that left a whisper trail, after someone had taken the leftover sandwiches and listed who they would go to and how to get them there without waking babies, I walked home with Tam and Jun. The city had the softness of a person who has been crying for a while and is now making tea. We passed a man playing a violin under a bridge who had tuned it to the angel hum and was making money hand over fist which he put meticulously into a pocket and then took out and handed to a woman with a sign that said SHEEPISHLY: RENT. We passed a building that had a light on in one window and nothing in the room but two chairs and a plant and two people telling the truth to each other in a way you could feel through brick.\n\nJun dropped a lemon and it rolled into the curb and he chased it and then stopped and looked at me and we laughed in that exhausted way that feels like a relief valve opening on a factory you used to hate but now requires because it keeps the lights on. Velez hovered near the streetlight like an extra bulb. I wanted to ask it to go away and I wanted it to stay and I told it neither thing because choosing is exhausting and I have learned to save that muscle for when I need it.\n\nAt home, my table wasn\u2019t big enough for the important papers now, so we put important papers on the floor and on the bed and under the plant and on the windowsill and in the sink for a minute while I washed my hands very thoroughly because my mother\u2019s ghost still believes in soap. I wrote Hello. I am a person. We have a plan again on a pad because sometimes handwriting your own script into yourself is the only way to allow that your mouth said the thing. This time the period at the end looked heavier, as if gravity had upped its insistence by one small notch we could withstand so long as we didn\u2019t pretend we couldn\u2019t feel it.\n\nThe thunder that came was not storm but infrastructure, a construction sound from outside the city where they were building a temporary bridge over a piece of river that had gotten ideas. It sounded like paper folded with purpose. It sounded like a boat being born from flat. It sounded like something we were going to ask people we love to step into, hand in hand, without knowing where the shoreline was going to present itself on the other side. I poured water into glasses and handed them to my people and put my own glass down too close to a map and smeared a line and then apologized to the map out loud because I have turned into that kind of person. We slept in shifts with the angels three degrees off our windows and the city breathing through its teeth and the clock over the gym being wrong on purpose as a kindness to us all.",

It wasn\u2019t even a night in the calendar sense; it was one of those in-between hours with day still clinging to the edges, enough light in the west that the pigeons hadn\u2019t given up yet. We were in the gym hub taking stock of things with labels, and then all at once every conversation leaned the same way because something at the top of us had turned its head. People went outside in clumps\u2014curiosity is a herd animal\u2014and then froze in doorways when the stars did the thing they do in bad renderings, the wrongness inserted on purpose so you\u2019ll notice. They slid, not quickly but wrong-speed, like a clock hand being pushed by a child. A man said aloud to an empty patch of bleachers, \u201cThat\u2019s not possible,\u201d and then sat down and put his head in his hands before the sentence finished. Someone laughed because that is what fear does when backed into a corner. A woman clapped her hands once like she was calling a dog, and then covered her mouth as if she had woken something.\n\nWe had told them to stay inside if the sky paraded. We had told them the parade was not for us. We had taped notes to the doors like you tape a reminder to a fridge: three lines in black marker, the ink bleeding a little because the paper was cheap. Stay inside. Breathe so your bones hear. Sing if you must. People read it and then read it again and then did not believe it until belief was easier than standing exposed with your hair lifted by a wind you couldn\u2019t find. Tam put her palm at the back of my ribs where the breath gets stuck and counted, one-two-three-four, her voice so steady it made me feel like I was in a boat that did not know the word capsize. Jun\u2019s spreadsheet got forgotten for ten minutes, which is a catastrophe in his world, and he stood staring at nothing except everything, then blinked hard and went around closing windows because sometimes the best thing you can do for a city is become the person who closes things that were opened too far.\n\nThe sound, when it came, did not come through ears. Velez had said bones and I had assumed he meant it metaphorically, but bones have ownphones we\u2019ve just never been made to answer before. It was a tone like someone dragging a finger around a wineglass that had been growing at the same temperature as the ocean. It said, Hold. It said, Stay. It said, You are not fragile but you are not in charge. The worst of us went outside to point guns at the sky because ritual is hard to quit. The best of us put hands on knees and remembered how to persuade the body to continue. A kid under the bleachers started humming and then someone hummed with him and then the whole left side of the gym was a chorus, low and ridiculous and perfect, the way people singing always is when they\u2019re not performing for money.\n\nWhen it passed, it didn\u2019t. It changed shape and weight and slid into a different room of the body. We crept to windows and decided not to look straight up yet, the way you get out of bed and do a lap of the hallway before confronting a mirror after you\u2019ve cried. The stars remembered themselves in a rush, as if embarrassed, and people began to talk like air being let out of something. Someone made a joke about retrograde and the astrologer in the corner rolled her eyes in a way that told me she would tell a better joke later when she had her breath back. I found Velez by not looking for it and felt it like the pressure at the back of a closed door. It made the little motion that means yes without showing off, which is a skill angels are only now learning.\n\n\u201cRehearsal,\u201d it said, arranging light like somebody smoothing a collar. \u201cNot for you. For the fold. It is learning its bad manners.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said to sing to our bones, not the sky,\u201d I said, and my voice sounded like something that needed oil. \u201cWe sounded ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sounded correct,\u201d it said. \u201cRidiculous is a kind of correct that keeps you alive.\u201d\n\nOut in the square beyond the gym, a man shouted that this was a sign of salvation and tried to sell candles at a markup. Holm walked over with a look on her face like, Of course, and bought every candle and then handed them out for free and called him honey when he sputtered. Sana sat on the floor with her back against the wall and wrote three pages of notes about what instruments she didn\u2019t have that she wished she did and then circled the words cheap accelerometer twice. Kieran ran outside and spun slowly while staring, then swayed and sat down and said, \u201cOkay then,\u201d to the concrete. Dana covered her ears and took them off and covered them again and I loved her for the honesty of indecision.\n\nBy midnight the city was tired of pretending it could make the sky behave through observation alone. People went home, or to new homes built inside the bones of old schools, and cooked noodles on hot plates and told stories of former nights that had felt like the end just to make this one feel like part of a parade float of endings instead of a knife point. I slept early for six minutes and dreamed that my driver had grown hair and was humming in my bag. Tam shook me awake softly and handed me a sandwich that had so much mustard on it it felt honest. Velez hummed outside a window the way a bee will hover a second too long to be polite, and then dimmed so we could all pretend we were only a building with a gym in it, not a lung with a city wrapped around it.\n\nIn the morning the news tried to name the thing that had happened and failed three times and then settled on a word that meant nothing and felt safe in the mouth, and I forgave them because making language was a bucket and at least they were carrying. The pundit with the hurricane haircut said my name like it had a handle he could turn and asked whether women who hit balls for a living were qualified to advise on geophysics, and then a woman from the earthquake office with a face like a cup of coffee answered, \u201cYes,\u201d without looking up because she was busy making a list of buildings that needed their spines checked. The internet divided into jokes about retrograde and diagrams amplified until they turned to chalk dust. The angels did not explain. They went in groups to nursing homes and sat outside windows and made the kind of light that doesn\u2019t ask for thank you.\n\nThe ears gave us a reply that afternoon and we were not ready for it because we had told ourselves that answers only come when you\u2019re holding instruments properly. The drained pool had become our favorite mistake; it read as silly to anyone who believed that science wore only clean coats. The teenagers who had spray painted their names inside it years ago now stood on the deck pressing their hands into their pockets and watching like they\u2019d been asked to babysit a very expensive toddler. We began humming the song we\u2019d been given for Place One, which we had not named yet because names make false ownerships, and the room did its temperature trick and then something smaller and meaner: a metallic smell like coins between teeth, and then a curl of scent over that like resin or the first cut you make into a sap-bleeding tree.\n\nKieran had set up a grid of sensor plates and sugar water loops and a piece of silk over a ring like a cheap toy magic trick. A bead formed on the silk that was not condensation in the usual sense because the temperature in the room did not support it and there was no source we could point to with a finger that would satisfy a teacher. The bead fell, and I knew when it hit the plate that we had to slow time as much as possible without becoming statues. Sana moved like a chess piece and I watched gratitude become a weapon in her hand. She scooped the drop with a glass tip and set it into a vial and labeled it with her handwriting that looked like someone had taught her to write in the middle of a chase scene. She handed the vial to a kid who was suddenly a courier in a movie and he ran as if the hallway were a track with both ends on fire.\n\nWe had promised ourselves and each other that we would not breathe anything we didn\u2019t understand just because it used the shape of our longing. We had the fume hood and the sterilizer that smelled faintly like hospitals and grandparents. The first test Sana did was so simple I wanted to kiss her: she warmed the droplet near a clean wire and watched whether the smoke went up or refused to be smoke. It went up, which meant we\u2019d stayed in our own air. No alien pathogens, at least not on the part of our chart where we could make notes. She did three more things with the same slow hands and then looked up and smiled in a way that told me a big thing: someone had stood at a cliff and not fallen and she had witnessed it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s resin-ish,\u201d she said, finding a word that wasn\u2019t in any categorized smell list. \u201cLow salt. Trace something that reads as pine if pine had been taught a new trick. Something that hums like chalk when you scratch a plate but for noses.\u201d She stopped and huffed at herself and I loved her for her attempts to make poetry serve data because the reverse had been happening to us all week and it was only fair. \u201cThere\u2019s oxygen in the way we like it in our lungs, but that could be bias. It\u2019s like we told the air a story about what we wanted and it nodded halfway.\u201d\n\n\u201cLake,\u201d I said without meaning to, and then I was embarrassed because it felt like I was naming a baby at a grocery store by pointing at whatever I could see. \u201cI mean the summer smell where for an hour the mosquitoes forget to exist. I mean that. It\u2019s in there.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in there,\u201d Dana said, and she didn\u2019t look up from her chart where she had made new symbols because the old ones had run out. \u201cThis is the part where we argue about who gets to choose the word, and then we decide no one gets to choose the word until we find the place with our feet, if we ever do. Until then we call it by numbers and songs and something we can\u2019t ruin with our ownership.\u201d\n\nThe teenagers started calling it Blue Two because the paint had once been blue and the second vial had been slightly darker, and I felt dizzy with relief at being spared a myth for five minutes. We put the vial in a cooler as if it were human and carried it to a place where it could get translated into numbers that would make Kieran exhale like a relieved window. The angels watched without comment in their way that is not detached so much as protective of our right to pretend we had thought of it all. Velez leaned toward me until my hair lifted and said a thing that rang true and annoyed me: \u201cYou will get addicted to small good news,\u201d it said. \u201cRation it like sugar. It makes the rest possible but it will rot your optimism if you chug.\u201d\n\nThe Major came back with new shoulders. He had taken off the jacket that advertised his rank and put on one that just said his name, ARROYO stitched small and almost not there. He brought trucks and people who had spent their lives wanting to be given tasks they could complete with their hands and timelines. He found me making a list with bad pen on worse paper and waited awkwardly to be told he could speak, even though I had never once asked him to wait to speak. \u201cMy kid,\u201d he said, and he did not add a verb, which is how you know a man is not practicing. \u201cShe came to the hub last night because she was with her mom and they thought it was just\u2026 a warming station. She slept on a yoga mat and woke up when the sky\u2014\u201d and he moved one hand in a circle that meant the word none of us had. \u201cShe said a woman sang and it made her chest stop hurting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat woman is fourteen,\u201d I said because we had the list of who hummed and when because we write everything down when we think we might forget later that we were brave. \u201cWe\u2019re feeding her pancakes for the rest of her life.\u201d\n\nHe nodded and did the thing where a man wipes his eye like he\u2019s adjusting his face. \u201cTell me what to guard and what to ignore,\u201d he said, and the humility in it broke something tender in me that I hadn\u2019t realized I was armoring. \u201cI have people good at doors. They need better doors.\u201d\n\n\u201cGuard the ear rooms,\u201d I said. \u201cGuard the insulin without making people feel like you\u2019ll shoot them to protect their medicine; stand there like an uncle. Ignore the people selling candles until they sell knives with the candles. And if anyone says the words body count, put them in a corner like a toddler and don\u2019t let them talk in public until they remember how to say people.\u201d\n\n\u201cCopy,\u201d he said, and meant it in the radio way, which was fine because every language gets to borrow. \u201cAnd about the team from the\u2014\u201d He stopped and smiled at himself. \u201cAbout the guys in suits who want to requisition your hubs for continuity of government. They\u2019re in the lobby. They don\u2019t like my face when I am polite.\u201d\n\nHolm appeared like the manifestation of his sentence with her hair doing the thing it does when hats have been asked of it and refused. She had a stack of forms that said REQUEST on the top and a pen that had given up three times and had teeth marks that looked new. \u201cWe have to work with them,\u201d she said, and we all made faces because adults rarely get to be purely righteous. \u201cBut they don\u2019t get to rename what we already built. No acronyms,\u201d she added, and it and I laughed because I love a rule that propagates in the wild.\n\nWe went to the lobby and shook hands with men who wore their watches heavy and their shoes quiet. They used the word theater like an accusation and I used the word staging like a bridge and after ten minutes we all agreed that there would be a table in the corner where someone from their world could sit and take notes and be useful without owning the furniture. They wanted to know how we would keep order if people didn\u2019t listen, and I said, \u201cWe will listen first,\u201d and they blinked like someone had thrown cold water in their faces. One of them tried to hand me a binder with tabs that said things like FOOD AUTHORITY and INCIDENT ESCALATION, and I took it from him because refusing a binder is bad optics when cameras are near, and then handed it to Jun without looking and Jun put it under a potted plant and smiled sweetly until the camera left.\n\nThe mouth almost happened and then didn\u2019t, and the part of me that believes in luck as a species of genius will put that day on a small shelf forever. We had said ear so often that we thought we were safe from our own hunger to pry, but metaphors are slippery. A private lab out by the beltway, a building with mirrored glass that made it look like it wanted to spy on itself, started vibrating on someone else\u2019s channel. An engineer who loved machines more than rules had built a chamber that did two things at once and he was so proud he wanted to be forgiven in advance. The song had bent in their room, and then there had been a moment of thinned air like the breath you hold when you pass someone crying on a bus, and then a smell that wanted to be called meat. A tech with a hair tie around her wrist had texted a friend at a hub while her boss went to find a tie; the friend texted a friend; the friend texted Holm; Holm texted me; I texted Velez even though that is not how it works and the reply was a light at the edge of my vision that made me step backward without deciding to.\n\nWe went in a van because sometimes the future still arrives in vans that smell faintly of French fries. Arroyo brought two of his door people, who had door eyes but hearts not yet crushed by door work. Holm wore a blazer like armor and flats like a concession. Sana brought the tone generator in its padded case, which looked like a violin and felt just as sensitive to insult. Tam drove because she trusts only her hands when urgency is in the car. We didn\u2019t have a warrant of any kind and also this is not a story where warrants matter; we had the arrogance of being right and the backup of languages we could switch to mid-hallway to confuse a man with a lanyard.\n\nThe building\u2019s guard looked like a person who had once believed in rules and now believed in shift change. He tried to tell us to stop and Holm said, \u201cMinister,\u201d and didn\u2019t flash a badge because we hadn\u2019t made those yet, and he stepped aside because people love titles even as they claim not to. Inside we could hear a hum that wasn\u2019t on any of our lists of okay hums. The chamber had been welded from steel that had wanted to be a boat twenty years ago, and it sat in a room with too many wires and too little sense. A man with eyes like a raccoon on day four of a thesis defense tried to convince us we were lucky to witness his first success, and Sana said, in the quiet voice that breaks arrogance quicker than shouting, \u201cTurn it off or we leave and take out your breakers.\u201d\n\nThe tech with the hair tie looked at me and made teeny finger gestures that meant, Please be the adult in the room that I can\u2019t afford to be, and I felt my heart put on a uniform I had not issued, which is something hearts do when told they are in charge. \u201cYou are building a mouth,\u201d I said. \u201cYou are building a door with a bias. You are calling it a window so you can sleep. Turn it off.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are on a deadline,\u201d he said, which is the scariest sentence a scientist can say to me now.\n\n\u201cSo is the Earth,\u201d Tam said, and I loved her for the way she can throw a sentence like a brick into a stack of red cups. \u201cNobody is trying to beat the apocalypse to the finish line by cheating on a test.\u201d\n\nSana stepped in and laid a hand on the tone generator case like a parent resting a hand on a sleeping child. \u201cWe will give you an ear,\u201d she said, and the man flinched at the word choice because ears imply listening equals humility. \u201cYou can have sensor time. You can have math. You cannot have a mouth yet. You cannot build a hinge that only swings one way and hope the air doesn\u2019t notice.\u201d\n\nArroyo had already begun unplugging things with the skill of a man who understands that electricity is a kind of badly behaved river. He pulled a cord gently and then another, and the hum dimmed a shade and I could feel my teeth uncurl. Velez glowed so bright in the corner that the tech muttered whoa without meaning to, and then put both hands on the table like she was steadying a patient. The raccoon-eyed man put his face in his hands and did not say sorry, which was fair because he was not sorry; he was thwarted. I recognized the feeling and despised it and offered him a job he didn\u2019t want yet in three weeks when he would come looking because this is how you steal brilliance back from hunger.\n\nAfter, in the van, Holm laughed so hard it scared me, and then she cried in one breath like a faucet with a weight on the handle, and then she said, \u201cWe need a pipeline for whistleblowers that isn\u2019t just teenagers texting their cousins,\u201d and Jun, who had come because he can sense when a spreadsheet is going to need a new column, wrote the word WHISTLES in all caps on the top of a page and then softer beside it wrote the words cookies and parking validation because he is the only person in the city who understands that justice requires snacks and a place to put your car without being ticketed.\n\nWe named the first place accidentally, which I should have expected given that all the best names are like that. The vial had a label in Sana\u2019s hand and a smudge from my thumb where I\u2019d been careless, and the smudge made a streak that looked like a small mountain seen from far away on a map drawn by a child. Dana pointed at it and said, \u201cRidge,\u201d and then shook her head because she didn\u2019t want to be the one to say it first. Arroyo said, \u201cTone,\u201d because he was reading the graph Kieran had printed and taped badly to a wall. Jun, without looking, said, \u201cRidgetone,\u201d and the room said it back to itself and then frowned because it was ugly and therefore likely to stick. We decided to call it that and not in public, to give ourselves a place to stand that the internet didn\u2019t own. The teenagers hated it and started a poll to rename it Lakeward, which was better and worse, and I shrugged because fighting over a nickname is how you get people to show up to a meeting they didn\u2019t want to go to.\n\nI went back to the course because there are only so many hours you can ask a body to hold responsibility without giving it a familiar ritual to wash its hands in. It was not my day, it was no one\u2019s day, and still the fairways had people scattered the way a small town scatters at a fair. They were not swinging clubs and the sight of that made me exhale in a way I could trust. They were walking the lines we had all walked before when none of this had happened and saying to each other, \u201cThis is where she sliced once,\u201d and \u201cThis is the stupid bunker that ate her,\u201d and \u201cThis is where I dropped my keys and found them because a stranger had noticed,\u201d which is a ritual and a kindness in equal measure. The bunker on seventeen still sat like an old idea that used to be fun. The angels were further out that day, hovering above the treeline like a punctuation mark waiting for a sentence to earn it.\n\nColin\u2019s shopping list was in my pocket and I took it out and read it again because there is a certain holiness in inventory. Cabbage. Rice. Paper towels. Something crossed off that might be onions or might be a debt. I walked to the corner store and bought the items and then walked back to the course and left the bag on the counter of the pro shop where his mug was not, where his name was not, where the new kid behind the counter with a face like a second chance looked at the bag and then at me and said, \u201cWhat is this,\u201d and I said, \u201cThis is me doing a very small thing for a person who is very not here,\u201d and he nodded like a man who has been given a blessing he didn\u2019t request and will honor anyway.\n\nHolm started sleeping on a cot in her office, not because she wanted to make a martyr out of her spine but because there was no other place to put the maps. Tam kept a list of who had gone home and who had not, and once I saw her add my name to the second column and cross it out and add it again and then draw a heart around it like a teenager, and I had to go into a stairwell and let my face do a thing that wouldn\u2019t survive fluorescent light. Sana began collecting broken instruments\u2014violins with hair missing, trumpets with stuck valves, a bass drum that had been kicked by a marching band with poor impulse control\u2014and putting them in the ear rooms not to play but to listen, because she believed and made me believe that metal and wood remember things we don\u2019t and might show us how not to be rude to physics. Dana learned how to sleep sitting up without falling over. Kieran started calling his mother more often and once I answered his phone because his hands were inside a wire harness and talked to a woman who said, \u201cHe was there when the creek flooded and he was eight and he made a dam out of sticks that held for an hour, did he tell you,\u201d and I said, \u201cHe will,\u201d and she said, \u201cHe will not,\u201d and we hung up both satisfied.\n\nPeople asked me to go to their meetings and I learned quickly how to be two in a day before noon. A group in a church basement with coffee in urns and a smell like old books wanted to talk about what the beginning of leaving would look like because the leaving was a rumor nobody trusted and an obligation everybody dreaded. A group in a park wanted to be told they were vital and were, which is always a relief to be able to say honestly. A group in a warehouse wanted permission to build little things that look like boats out of truck tires and faith, and I said yes because they were not putting people in them, they were putting hope in them and rolling it around to see if it leaked. A group in a rich living room wanted to donate without having to come to the hub and I told them where to send money and then told them to show up anyway and bus tables with their soft hands for three hours because money is important and so is the sound a rich person makes when they realize the bread smells the same no matter who slices it.\n\nThe blowout hair man got a crowd to chant my name like an extinction event and I found the clip by accident when a volunteer\u2019s phone fell on play. He said things about expertise that would have made sense to me when I was twenty-two and still believed we should only be led by people with laminated cards, and then he said something that made the room behind my ribs go cold in a new way: he talked about triage like it was a sport. He wanted ships for the loyal and ships for the skilled and ships for the \u201cclean,\u201d and I said the word out loud in my kitchen and my rubber plant leaned away like even it could not stand that sound. Jun printed the transcript and marked through the words that would hurt us if they stuck, and wrote in the margin, We do not triage people. We triage tasks, and I kissed the top of his head when he wasn\u2019t looking because if I had said the words out loud I would have made a speech and we were on a speech diet.\n\nWe wrote the code on a wall near the door to the gym with a marker that had seen too much. It was not a code like encryption; it was a code like a recipe. No mouths. No acronyms. No kings. Lists when needed. Stories when needed. Buckets always. We added a line that Dana insisted on and Sana seconded: Data belongs to the neighborhood first. It got messy immediately because neighborhoods are messy and data is greedy and I have made peace with the fact that most rules are just temporary walls to lean on while you tie your shoe. We added another line in a different hand because the wall was not our paper; it was ours: If a door opens one way, we walk away. If a door opens two ways, we put a person in it never, and a leaf first, and then a machine, and then possibly a rumor, and then maybe a person when we have learned the rumor by heart.\n\nOn a Thursday at a time that would once have been traffic and now was just motion, a bus driver named Lo brought two dozen people from the far side of the river to the hub because their church had burst with volunteers and they needed to overflow. She had a tattoo of an anchor on her wrist and the laugh of a person who had been told a fine and had paid it and had not cried in public once. She had a binder full of names and allergies and the number of a guy who had access to a freezer truck, and I looked at her and said the quiet part out loud, \u201cYou are on the list,\u201d and she said, \u201cWhat list,\u201d because this is the kind of person she is. I told her about the witnesses and she swore and then said, \u201cFine,\u201d because humility is a door and she knows which way to push.\n\nWe took the first instruments to the bridge the city was building in the wrong place because we didn\u2019t have the right place yet. Engineers who had learned to be poets that week set up transponders that were not weapons on a span that was not done. They tilted panels to listen to the song in a way that made me feel like a father in a movie teaching a child to shave. The angels hovered out over the water and did not touch it because they were learning to make the hard choice not to be useful in ways that make us lazy. A woman from the chorus in the old church with the cracked nave stood and sang a phrase into the wind and the wind brought the sound back to her with an extra weight like it had picked up a coin. A boy balanced on the rail with frogs in his pockets and looked like a person I would have followed up a mountain. The song made a shadow on the water like a map you could only read if you could hold your breath.\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d Velez said, because it had learned the rhythm of my questions, and I did not pretend I hadn\u2019t asked.\n\nAt home that night Tam tried to teach me to sleep again. She put on a bad murder show that we had seen twice before and it worked for a quarter of an hour until someone said alibi like a poem, and then I sat up because the word backwards meant something about the fold and I couldn\u2019t stand that my brain was now a spigot that never turned off. She put her hand on my chest and I performed breathing. We talked about a thing that wasn\u2019t this for three whole minutes, which was as close to a vacation as we are allotted in this epoch. I told her a story about a tournament where the bathroom on the front nine had been haunted by a tampon dispenser that made a sound like a failing airplane and she laughed until she couldn\u2019t breathe just right and then we both breathed right to fix it. She admitted, in a voice like someone confessing they don\u2019t brush their teeth at night sometimes, that she had once almost become a chef before becoming a person who can carry someone else\u2019s clubs as if they were heart valves. I promised her a kitchen on the other side of whatever this is that could hold heat like a secret, and she promised me a corner that is only mine in every room we ever build for anyone, and I went to sleep with my hand on her hip and woke up that way, which is the kind of grace I mean when I pretend not to believe in it.\n\nThere was a night when the angels sang without being asked and I knew before the window went pale that they were singing apology. They had found a group upstate building a mouth on purpose and lied about it, not the angels but the people, and the angles had sharpened in the room and a mouse had run out with hair on end and a child had had a nosebleed out of nowhere and an old man had forgotten his name for ten seconds and we did not get a call until after because people hide their worst tries until they crash. We drove again and this time the drive was silent in the van in the way that means everyone is managing their anger like a pan with a lid that does not fit. We turned off the thing that should not have been turned on and I said, because I had to say it to believe it could be said, \u201cNo,\u201d and the room held the word like a small animal that would bite if startled. A woman yelled that we were killing her children because she had believed that she could put them in a door and they would be saved thirty seconds before the rest of us. I wanted to yell back because she had said the ugly part out loud, but instead I asked her the names of her children and wrote them down in my book and she watched me write them like she was deciding if she would let me. We gave her bus tickets and a schedule and protein bars and she left crying and I stood for five minutes staring at my own handwriting and thinking, This is one way the world ends, not with pride or a bang but with a good person caught by a bad hinge.\n\nIf you are waiting for the part where we launch a ship you have to wait longer, because ships are for later and we were still becoming the kind of people who could build one. We learned to build ears in six cities and a village that had never had a coffee shop but had always had a way of finding lost dogs. We learned the song of a second place and a third and they were nothing like the first, one with a sourness that read as metal trying to be soil, one with a sweetness that felt like a bag of rotten fruit left in a car. We learned which songs made the sugar water shiver and which made it cry. We failed to translate spectrum into hunger and had to settle for making graphs we could point at with a pencil and say, \u201cHere is where it turns its head.\u201d We bought a secondhand freezer at a police auction and took the bullets out of its story and put vials inside it and promised not to live or die by the contents.\n\nA woman in a lab in a country three time zones away that had taught me the word jacaranda when I didn\u2019t know it yet wrote to us with a diagram we had not asked for and a joke in the subject line and a grievance in the postscript about our refusal to make acronyms, and I wrote back and asked how her wife was taking her eating schedule, and she wrote back a paragraph about soup that made me want to get on a plane that did not exist anymore. A boy in a town I had never been to sent me a photo of a chalkboard with a plan on it that was so clear it made me jealous and then delighted, and I printed it and taped it to the wall by the plant and the plant leaned toward it like a reader.\n\nWe found out, because the world cannot resist showing its bruises to a camera, that there were camps forming in places where men with new flags had decided their words would be the last ones. They said Family and meant Border. They said Order and meant Fear. They said Ship and meant Ark and I went very still because I had hoped the old metaphors had rotted in storage. We sent people to set up hubs across the street from the camps and fed people their own names and asked them if they wanted to hold a clipboard or a child and listened to their answers like we might learn how to make chairs that did not splinter under weight. The angels hovered above the camps and did not sing, which is the only way to be honest around certain kinds of theater.\n\nOn a morning with cloud cover like a lid, the air over the river did a thing that made me believe in practice like a religion. The song we called Ridgetone echoed back at us with a new harmonic we had not taught it and that meant we had learned something without being given permission. I stood on the bridge that was still pretending to be a bridge and put my hands on the rail and felt the vibration move through metal that had once been ore in a mountain and now was a road and thought, If we deserve another place, it will be because of this feeling, the one that starts in the palm and moves into the chest and becomes the desire to make a thing quiet through competent motion. Velez hovered alongside at shoulder height and did not speak and I did not either because sometimes the leadership is in refusing to narrate.\n\nWe wrote new words on the wall that day because the old ones had found their uses and we needed more. We added: Ask permission even if you don\u2019t know who to ask. We added: Seeds are also apologies. We added: No lotteries until we make sure the bowl isn\u2019t full of only spoons. We added: The person who hates meetings the most gets to run the first ten. And, in smaller print because we were embarrassed to be sentimental in public, we wrote: Keep each other\u2019s jackets flat.\n\nThe next rehearsal came two days later and it was worse and easier because we were different. The stars turned their wrong way and we sat and hummed and some people outside hummed louder and some sat very still and held hands with a stranger like a lifeline and the sky pretended it was not a participant. Someone tried again to sell candles and Arroyo bought them all and this time he lit one and put it on the steps and we all sat for two minutes and pretended to pray and I learned a new thing: sometimes pretending is the only way to open the real. After, a man looked at me and said, \u201cI changed my mind about you,\u201d and I said, \u201cI know,\u201d without being unkind, and he laughed like a rock being thrown into a river and apologized to the water for the splash.\n\nWhen I finally took a day off it wasn\u2019t one. I made pancakes at my place and burned three and ate them anyway because the day had been about charity and I wanted to be consistent. Jun came over with a paper bag of lemons and a dozen index cards with the word Quieter written on them because he had taken it upon himself to rename the days that used to be Saturday. Tam wore socks that did not match on purpose and lay on my couch like a person performing rest. The rubber plant had decided to become an extrovert and we applauded it quietly. Velez hovered outside like a good boundary and hummed once when the kettle boiled, which is the kind of friendship I can tolerate with the divine.\n\nWe didn\u2019t talk about ships because if we had the day would have turned its face toward duty. We talked about the smell the ear had brought us and how it had changed our relationship to the word pine and whether we were allowed to hope that somewhere there is a tree that would not be offended by our leaning. We talked about the shoe that had hit the podium and whether we could turn that story into a warning or whether it had to stay exactly what it was: a thing that happened in a square during a speech and was resolved by laughter and a man putting his pockets inside-out. We talked about my mother and her sandwiches and how she would have wrapped every one of your names in wax paper and sent them with you and I cried and then laughed because crying is a version of cleaning and I was overdue.\n\nWhen the phone rang it was a number without area code because those had stopped mattering. A voice I didn\u2019t know said, \u201cWe found a song you didn\u2019t give us,\u201d and my stomach did the thing stomachs do when you are about to learn something you did not schedule. It was a farm in a state I had never wanted to visit and now suddenly would, a place where people had their own language for the wind and their own gossip about the soil. They had been playing the radio near the goats and the angels had translated the goats into another frequency because apparently you can become a conduit by accident while chewing. The song did a thing we did not expect and a thing that we had feared: it echoed inside a silo until the silo remembered it was meant to be a bell. The old farmer said, \u201cMy wife heard it and smiled without her dentures in,\u201d and I said, \u201cWe\u2019re on our way,\u201d because this is how you run a world near the edge: you remind it it still knows how to make bells, even out of things it had repurposed as storage for grain.\n\nWe drove with the windows open because the van had acquired a smell like too many meetings and I needed to remember that air could be different. The road was the kind of road that turns into stories without asking. The sky did not rehearse for us that day; it minded its manners, which made me suspicious and grateful in equal measure. We passed a billboard that had been repainted to say BE NICE in letters that looked like they had been trying to be a cow and given up, and a kid on a bike shouted we\u2019re practicing at us and I shouted back what and he shouted being neighbors and my stupid eyes filled. Tam stuck her head out the window like a dog and yelled who taught you to be so good and the kid shrugged and kept riding because it is not a mystery; people always know until they forget.\n\nOn the farm the silo did ring when asked, a deep-bell sound like a hand under a chair. The goats looked at us like we were being dramatic and went on chewing. The farmer asked me to sign his wife\u2019s apron as if I were famous and I scrawled my name as if it meant something and then drew the small circle with a smile inside it because this was as close to a badge as she would ever want. We set up our plates and our silk and our sugar and sang the goat-translated song and the air did not change and then did, as if it were embarrassed to be caught doing a trick. The smell was not pine this time but something I could not name and later would: a resin that had been taught sadness. Dana wrote the new symbols and Kieran pressed his ear to the metal and tried to get it to talk back and it did not but it did hum, which is as rude as it is promising. Sana took the vial and looked at me and we both laughed for no reason I can tell you except that sometimes the body releases.\n\nOn the drive back, we passed a group of kids building ears out of hula hoops and old sheets and their parents watched from porches with expressions that had hope in them in a way that made me worry about the weight of our luck. Velez did not follow; it had gone to sit on a water tower and learn from rust. The radio tried to give me my own voice back through a speaker and I turned it down because I am not a person who learns from hearing herself on delay. Tam sang a stupid song about lemons to make me remember that the world remembers how to be stupid, and I leaned my head against the window and watched the trees go by and thought, not for the first time, about the word after. It had started to feel like a room that could have furniture instead of a cliff.\n\nThat night, around three, the city did the thing where it breathes in the middle of the night as if it is counting itself, and I dreamed of a green that was not grass but something new that would take my weight. I stood at the edge of a long fairway that had never needed mowing, and the flag was a flying thing that had decided to pretend to be a flag for the afternoon. I swung my driver and the sound it made was the song of a planet we had not named and I woke with my hand in the air as if to apologize to the ceiling for the noise. In the morning Jun put a new word on the wall under all the other rules. He wrote: Practice joy, and I rolled my eyes and kissed his cheek and we went to work.",

It was the train station that had been stranded since the line was cut years ago, a vaulted room with a clock face that lied one honest lie forever. We chose it for a Witnesses\u2019 circle because it was neutral ground and because its benches remembered holding grief without curating it. We had dragged folding chairs that pinched fingers if you forgot which hinge was treacherous. Someone had laid out a table of cut oranges and cups that tasted like they had been clean and then stored near a broom. The angels perched in the high windows like a rumor the pigeons had stopped believing in. I had asked everyone to bring the object they reach for when they\u2019re solving something, and so we had a pile on the floor: a whisk, a multimeter, a seam ripper, a battered pocket atlas, a spool of mason\u2019s line, a dog-eared zine about breaker boxes, a needle-nose plier, a Sharpie that had survived three administrations, a coil of tape white as bone. We were telling stories of doors we had refused to be, of rules we had made inside ourselves and forgotten until now, when the ceiling briefly bowed like a person about to sneeze and the station made a sound like a hinge reconsidering its life.\n\nYou know how a room gets quiet right before someone says the inappropriate thing and then doesn\u2019t, and in that silence you can hear chairs making tiny adjustments to people? The air did that. The pillars shivered in their paint. The floor under us gave, not in the catastrophic way of collapse but in the mercy way of a trampoline that wants to show you how to be held. Someone gasped without permission. Arroyo put his hand on his radio like a talisman and did not key it because he is learning which noises to resist. I held my breath because the instinct to freeze is embedded deep in the animal that runs my ribs. Dana whispered, \u201cOh, hello,\u201d to the air as if greeting a stranger at a neighbor\u2019s party. The door to the old ticket office opened by itself and then closed with the caution of a shy cousin. The angels hummed very low and we all heard it in our knees.\n\nAfter, when the roof remembered its job and the clock remembered its lie, Holm said in a voice that had lost its edges, \u201cOkay,\u201d and nobody laughed because the humor would have broken like a cheap plate. We took inventory the way you do after a lovemaking that has made you weep: windows, fine; columns, fine; the poster with a smiling family from 1973 asking for exact change, still lying; Jun\u2019s stack of index cards, scattered like good seeds; my pulse, late to its appointments and therefore present. A Witness named Lo with the anchor tattoo ran a thumb across her bottom lip and said, \u201cIt didn\u2019t want to hurt us,\u201d and the way she said it sounded like she had been hurt by gentler things. Velez drifted down until it hung at head-height and its light was soft enough to make me think of the underside of clouds seen from a plane aisle, and said, \u201cThe fold is practicing its handwriting. The first drafts are less dangerous when you are not proud.\u201d\n\nWe had brought a different kind of ear, one that didn\u2019t need a drained pool or a meta-skin. Sana had designed it while waiting for a kettle and then kept it because it was cheap and therefore likely to survive dumb hands. It was a set of nested hoops, aluminum stamped with letters from an abandoned art project, hung with sleeves of silk and strips cut from ruined shirts, a chandelier that wanted to be a fishing net. We had tied bells to it, not for romance but because the ear inside our skulls is a drum and bells talk to drums in a language everybody inherits. We hung the thing from one of the old station hooks where luggage had rested with dignity when people still wore hats out of respect fully dressed. When the room creased, the bells shivered without ringing, which meant the motion wasn\u2019t air and wasn\u2019t sound the way we measure either, which meant we could, if we were stupid, call it nothing. We refused that. Dana tapped the hoops afterward with the bone end of a comb and nodded as if someone had answered a proof in the back of the book.\n\nWe added a line to the wall that afternoon in a handwriting I didn\u2019t recognize: Practice inside, it said. Then this, smaller: If the sky wants an audience, make it pay with your patience. No one admitted to writing it and everyone obeyed it because it had the rhythm of a rule our grandmothers would recognize. We started drilling people in bone song as if we were planning to field a choir against a storm. We taught breath to construction workers and toddlers and men with earnest beards and women whose nails kept clean not by care but by the chemistries they ran at their kitchens tables. We kept it unpretty on purpose so it would be memory, not spectacle. People started humming in bus shelters and grocery lines and public bathrooms devoted to hand dryers that lied about warmth. We became ridiculous and therefore correct.\n\nThe decision I had been told would find me like a letter slid under a door began sliding with an address in my handwriting. It was not the ship yet, not that made thing dreamers brawl over in drawings. It was a throw. We needed to send an instrument through the crease that had shown itself in the station and then pretended to be shy. People with PhDs were rightfully interested in equations and people with calluses were rightfully interested in whether the thing would come back, and the overlap was a Venn diagram big enough to stand in. They built a ball because balls are democratic technology. It was a sphere of lattice that looked like it had opinions about cage birds. Inside were sensors that bled numbers when poked and a core that smelled faintly like the inside of a blank tape cassette. It had velvet on one rib not because velvet helps but because Kieran had looked at the ring of bare metal and said it felt mean and then fixed it the way you fix mean when it\u2019s in your hand.\n\n\u201cYou could just roll it,\u201d Arroyo said, but his voice did not sound like a man who believed in rolling anything important while the world learned to crease.\n\n\u201cThe floor isn\u2019t honest,\u201d Sana said. She had measured it by feel and had written the measurements on her palm and then licked her thumb and wiped them away to write the same ones again.\n\n\u201cWhat if you throw it,\u201d Tam said, so casually I turned and stared at her like she had been hiding her face inside a tree all morning. \u201cI\u2019m serious. A punch, not a full send. Low and committed. No flourish. You know that shot better than anyone.\u201d\n\nThe room did the small cough rooms do when one job learns the shape of another job and pretends to have known it all along. I looked at the ball the way I look at a dog that has learned a trick on its own. I could see the line because my muscles had grown a map of how to make sight into physics. My hands itched with the ghost of a grip. The crease had been at shin height for a blink, a fault line in air rather than stone, a thing I could trace with the memory of the way a putt breaks near the cup when greenkeepers have been bored. I did not want to be a person whose best skill was applicable to folding realities. I also did.\n\nWe cleared the benches to make a corridor that looked like a wedding aisle if unions were for putting objects into unknowns. People stood along the edges with their hands at their sides, as per the rule, and swallowed hard the way you do when you think someone might be about to make a hole in your day. I took the ball into my hands and felt its weight and thanked some prior Rhea for chasing the kind of strength that is precision and not glory. I imagined the shot the way Coach had taught me: a movie that ends with a touch rather than a thud. I sank into my hips the way confidence does whether invited or not. I made the small rehearsal swing like a person remembering a handshake, and then I let the made piece of the world go.\n\nIt left my hand like a promise. It skimmed ankle height, a shrew running, and the air at the waist of the room became wrong just long enough for the ball to slide between one idea of where we were and another. For a second it wobbled, a glitch that made my throat go tight, and then it disappeared the way a coin disappears when someone skilled has palmed it and you are in on the trick but not on the muscle. A woman near the end of the corridor covered her mouth not because she believed it would bring it back but because sometimes the hand knows what ritual is needed and the brain will learn it later.\n\nWe had put a string on it because we are assholes and also because this is how you tie yourself to fate without admitting you\u2019re doing it. The string whispered across the floor and then went slack then taut then slack again like a cat thinking about jumping onto a counter. We all flinched in the same direction because pack animals still reside in us. When it rolled back under the bench I thought I might vomit because I did not want its answer. The lattice was dusted with something that made a rim like the ring in colin\u2019s mug. It was not ash. It was too simple to be ash. I did not recognize it, which is how you know you are alive; if the world stops showing you new white powders, it has given up. Sana extended a small brush the way mourning extends a hand to the door frame and coaxed a drift into a vial and made three more vials like she believed in redundant mercy.\n\nKieran sniffed the ball because men with math will still sniff first when we aren\u2019t watching, and then he laughed that noise he makes when a puzzle gives up a corner. \u201cSalt,\u201d he said, not triumphant, not disappointed, just naming. \u201cNothing earth salt knows how to be. A salt that hasn\u2019t tasted our oceans. A salt that doesn\u2019t like our ways of being water.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bunker,\u201d I said, and everyone made a face at me because my metaphors had been tolerated but not embraced. \u201cIn my dream,\u201d I added because sometimes you submit evidence you can\u2019t prove because it wants to be next to the other evidence to feel like a family.\n\nWe argued without drawing blood for once because the rule on the wall had begun to breed in us. There was a quick, ugly discussion about whether we should lick the salt. We did not lick the salt. Sana did the three simplest tests again because a genius repeats the small true things until they become furniture. It dissolved slower than we like. It made a smell like a library taking its socks off after a long walk. It did not fizz like disappointment. Dana wrote a symbol that looked like a ladder down a page that already had too many ladders. The angels did not advise. Velez watched me in the wary way good teachers watch the moment a student realizes they are about to be asked to go on a stage they can\u2019t see yet.\n\nAfter the witness circle formalized itself around what we had done, the room began to do what all rooms do now: it turned into a hub by stealth. That is, it sprouted tables with sign-in sheets, a box for lost items, a corner where one kid drew on the floor in chalk and nobody told him not to because his lines were better than tape. A woman with two first names ran a pot of coffee that smelled like something we no longer sell and regulated everyone\u2019s cup with the authority earned by running a coat check when winter meant something. We used the station for the first meeting we had avoided having: the not-quite-list of not-quite-rules for how to choose where to build more ears.\n\n\u201cBus lines first,\u201d I said, and Holm smiled as if I had just remembered a friend\u2019s birthday without being reminded. \u201cHubs need to be reachable without a car because the future can\u2019t hear engines whining any louder than we already make them. The people nearest the water that thinks it might be a wall. The buildings with chairs already inside them, not because chairs are special but because chairs are a language doors speak. And stop me if I sound like a stack of clipboards pretending to be a human.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sound like a human in a clipboard hat,\u201d Dana said, which is the kind of insult that in this house lands like an arm around your shoulders. \u201cAlso the places with bathrooms people won\u2019t be ashamed to use. Dignity is a mouth that doesn\u2019t open, but it keeps people fed.\u201d\n\n\u201cPut ears in places with a reputation for rumors,\u201d Arroyo added, surprising himself. \u201cThey\u2019ll keep an eye on it for free because they can\u2019t bear not to know. It\u2019s a sin we can use that isn\u2019t a sin if the sign-in sheet is honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will need power without wires,\u201d Sana said, eyes flicking to the ceiling as if power hung above us like ripe fruit. \u201cHuman-crank. Small turbines where the gutters like to shout. Bikes that work smarter. Remember how to get a friction match to behave. We\u2019ll need a maniac who will cure their obsession by making us a better battery.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know three,\u201d Jun said, not smug because he doesn\u2019t know how to be. \u201cI\u2019ll bribe them with snacks and the ability to name something they did not invent.\u201d\n\nI made a speech I hadn\u2019t rehearsed because no one would let me go write it, and it came out as a list of particularities because the generalities feel like stealing. I said, \u201cPut one in the barber shop where the father and son fight kindly on Saturdays. Put one behind the dance studio where the floor knows names. Put one near the daycare that won\u2019t call itself a daycare because it knows the word makes some men feel weird about paying women. Put one in the senior center that smells like bingo markers and lies told without harm. Put one in the old parking garage where the reverb is good because it accidentally teaches you how to listen.\u201d The angels brightened the way I have learned means thank you and apology and promise all at once, and I put my hands on the back of the folding chair I\u2019d been standing behind because Donna, the woman who ran the coffee, had put her purse on it and I imagined her finding it later intact and liked the picture of her face.\n\nWe convened a Witness council without a table and without minutes and it still worked because Vincente brought markers in colors that looked like juice and wrote on butcher paper like graffiti. The names on the wall became a constellation that made a path if you squinted. Barber. Zipper-fixer. Librarian. Soup-line. Anchor-wrist. Lightning tech. Teen with humming radius. Bus driver with a rosary made of fuses. It felt like making a team out of an orphanage when the orphanage was run by the orphans.\n\nMy phone buzzed against my thigh, the insect of obligation, and I stepped away into a hall that smelled like old tile and decided not to answer because the corridor had that old building echo that makes every voice sound like it\u2019s from thirty years ago. Velez followed because it\u2019s learned that hallways are where humans admit the thing their mouths can\u2019t do in front of a bench. \u201cYou could have been a violin maker,\u201d it said, a door opening on a story I hadn\u2019t planned for.\n\n\u201cBecause my hands pay attention,\u201d I said, and put my forehead against the cool paint of the pillar because it had been keeping people up so long it deserved a kiss. \u201cOr because I like to fix what makes a tone.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you are patient with a thing that refuses to be rushed,\u201d it said. \u201cBecause you do not take a tool to a grain that will not like it and call that leadership. Because you could have spent your whole life listening to wood remember tree and you did not, and now you are listening to air remember water.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me another thing I don\u2019t want to know,\u201d I said, and immediately regretted it because every time I ask for that kind of hurt something important is delivered along with a bruise.\n\n\u201cWe cannot go,\u201d it said simply, and its light did that dimming that now felt like the lowering of a gaze. \u201cWe are made of your dark. We do not belong to the places we will tell you the songs of. We can hover and sing and warn and ache. We cannot be citizens there. We are a technology of witness, not a species for export.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re stuck in the play you helped direct,\u201d I said, not unkind because I had seen this face on a hundred mothers and on myself. \u201cIs that why you used the word forgive in public and didn\u2019t flinch.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not deserve the pronouns we use,\u201d it said. \u201cWe say we because it feels like a coat that lets us walk around in daylight and that is a lie we will be chewing forever. We have been made into a choir when once we were the thing that eats the audience. We will not be rewarded with applause. We will be asked to sing as you walk out. It is fair. It is unbearable. Both.\u201d\n\nI do not have the right to be the person who comforts a being that used to thirst for my blood, and yet here we are; we are always comforting the wrong person because the right person is busy. I touched the air two inches from where its shoulder would be if it had one and felt a heat like a lamp on a kind of almost-skin. \u201cYou can come to the hubs and sit in the rafters,\u201d I said. \u201cYou can stand over the insulin and hum like a refrigerator. You can terrify only those who deserve it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d it said, and if light can swallow once, it did. \u201cWe will build your ears and guard your ears and fight your mouths with our shame. We will do none of your choosing because you would die under our choosing. We will hold your jackets flat.\u201d\n\nWe went back into the station and the meeting had become a potluck without food. Everyone was putting up offerings: a schedule here, a car with a trunk there, a nephew who made drones out of parts that had never met. Dona from the soup-line had taped a sign to a pillar that said COOKS, and under it three names and two phone numbers and a little smile face that gave me more courage than angel light. Arroyo was teaching a teenager to say no to authority by letting him practice at him. Holm had cornered a councilman who had arrived with a suit and a face like stern pie and was explaining to him the difference between oversight and hovering; he looked like he was learning, and I did not take bets. Sana had used a shopping bag to make a sling for the lattice ball because people kept cradling it like a baby and I couldn\u2019t stand watching them rehearse a nursery.\n\nThat was the day the blowout-hair man tried to own a hub with a camera. He arrived on the station steps with a crew that moved like it had learned ballet in rooms with poor tile and the word exclusive on a board. He said my name the way a dentist says cavity. He asked to tour the ear because taxpayers and oversight and chain of command when applied to air. He held a microphone in the way a child holds a bug: anticipation and disgust. I did not step outside because if I had my body would have makes shapes my mother would have told me to save for the mirror. I sent Jun with a stack of clipboards and a lemon. Jun handed him a clipboard and a pen and said, \u201cWrite down what you will do for us besides speak,\u201d and held the lemon up to the camera and said, \u201cThis is our current symbol for people who help. You can hold it if you want.\u201d There is a clip of his face taking in citrus and failing to turn it into rhetoric, and I keep it on my phone for the nights I want proof that symbols are only powerful if they stick to skin.\n\nWe wrote the No Mouths pledge on the back of an old train map that still showed a lake that had become a park. It started as three sentences and then grew sentences around their hips like children holding on to mothers\u2019 legs. We put a swear in it on purpose so people would feel like it was theirs and not a grant proposal. We made everyone read it out loud who wanted to stand near an ear for longer than a song. Some people rolled their eyes and read it anyway because they wanted to be near a miracle. Some people read it and cried at the fourth line and then pretended they had a cold and we pretended not to notice. We taped the pledge next to the sign that said BATHROOMS and people read both with equal attention and I don\u2019t know anything that made me happier for a full hour after.\n\nThat night, tired thicker than soup, I went back to the course with Tam because the station\u2019s air had filled me with iron filings and I needed to become a magnet again. The floodlights were off because electricity is now something you ask permission from and I am trying to become a person who does not assume my yes is the first one. The fairways were silhouettes, wider at night like people who soften when nobody\u2019s watching. The bunker on seventeen lay where it always lies like a love that had been useful and then mean. We lay on our backs near the tee and looked up with the decision to see nothing but imagined stars even if they were doing the wrong thing. Tam pointed and told me a different kind of constellation: that\u2019s the one that looks like the bus stop where we met the woman who had the cat in her hood; that\u2019s the one that looks like the pile of shoes at the gym door after the sky tried to argue with us; that\u2019s the one that looks like your face when you said the word planets and didn\u2019t faint. I laughed, then hiccuped, then choked a little, then laughed again, and thought, if joy were on the schedule, it would never get done. You have to sneak it into the notes someone left on the break room fridge.\n\nWe launched the first not-ship a week later, and it wasn\u2019t a ship because we had kept our promise to ourselves. It was a moth made by stubborn hands, a raft for air, a kite with a chordal heart. The kids named it Moth because they are accountants of poetry and I want them in my government. It was a skeleton of rods and mesh the color of the inside of a seashell, with a belly full of ears and a spine that whistled when the wind got fresh. We built it in a school gym that had given up learning dodgeball and taken on learning humility. Jun made a checklist that ended with the line breathe. Lo drove it on a flatbed through streets that had learned, embarrassingly quickly, how to make room. People came out and put hands flat on its ribs because touching is how we make contracts we can\u2019t afford lawyers for. We rolled it onto the roof of the station because the sky had been rude there and because lifting a thing toward its work is ceremonial whether you want it to be or not.\n\nThe angels did not bless it because we are trying not to become a place where wind has titles. They stood three stories up in the air the way a good parent stands at the end of a diving board and puts their hands out without expecting a child to fall toward them. We held the lines like you hold a friend\u2019s hair when she is sick. The wind did what wind does when it is being watched and remembered its if, and we waited, which is the part that feels like weakness and is actually the muscle. When it took, it took clean. Moth rose without dramatics and our breath went with it and then came back because the rule on the wall had started becoming blood. It shivered where the air had creased a week before and didn\u2019t shatter, which taught me a new word from inside a word I thought I knew.\n\nThe data it sent down was less important than the message it sent our bodies, which is a sentence I will have tattooed one day if the world gets back its habit of making people do silly things with needle and ink. Numbers are love letters written by different kinds of mouths and we will keep them, frame them, argue about them, make new instruments just to be able to talk back to the parts that looked us in the eye. What mattered was watching a thing we made stand in a wind we didn\u2019t invent and not apologize. What mattered was the way the kids on the roof grabbed each other\u2019s hands without making a show of it, the way Arroyo said copy to the air and meant thank you, the way Holm didn\u2019t check her phone for a full three minutes and then checked it and laughed because a councilman had texted her Are the angels unionizing which meant we had won a different small war.\n\nWe had our first theft that week, and it did not come with the anger I\u2019d rehearsed for. Someone stole thirty vials from the freezer labeled with numbers I had learned like hymnals. We discovered it because the freezer door, which had been screwed up from a police auction and then unscrewed back down by a grandmother who knows where to kick, had been left open ajar enough to make the motor complain. The list on the whiteboard had a smear where the row of numbers lived, not frantic, deliberate, the work of a person who believes in erasers. We followed the line of sugar water drip that had been knocked over like a person too tired to be careful, and it led to a back door and then into a morning that smelled like eggs cooked in a pan without love.\n\nWe learned the thief\u2019s name not because we\u2019re detectives but because this is a city and names are communal property, and when you say \u201cshe had a scar like a comma by her mouth and a way of carrying a bag like a shift,\u201d someone will say, \u201cAllegra,\u201d and then five minutes later Allegra will be at the door because she has better hearing than most. She cried with that quiet experienced kind because this was not about her remorse; it was about her tiredness. She had built a mouth in an old laundromat with a boyfriend who wanted to marry her before the fold or die trying, and the mouth had been good at lying about its charms. They had poured a song in with a funnel they stole from the back of the bar and an air popped and her boyfriend had said he could see the other side and then couldn\u2019t because it wasn\u2019t a side and he had gone down like a man remembering a hole he\u2019d made in a field as a kid. She brought the vials back in a cooler that used to have a marlin on it, and I thought about punching her and then I thought about how much I had loved someone I was going to lose once and didn\u2019t, and I handed her a sandwich. Velez stood in the corner like a judgement we had all decided not to invite and did not speak, which is its new way of honoring us.\n\nWe wrote a new line on the wall that day in a slant hand: Forgive the crimes that come from practicing badly. Punish only the ones that come from selling tickets. Holm made a face and it wasn\u2019t because she disapproved; it was because it had the cadence of a rule that would get her yelled at by people who value the word consequences the way some people value lace. She signed off anyway with the line one uses when one is about to get yelled at by people who eat steak in rooms with wide tables: \u201cWe\u2019ll do the reasonable thing and call it extreme.\u201d I kissed her cheek and she threatened to revoke my privileges and we both laughed because it was the kind of fake threat you make to the people who are holding you up while you pretend to hold them up.\n\nThere is a photograph somewhere I hope no one ever sees because its beauty would get it framed by the wrong people: three angels hovering over a line of kids pulling on a rope attached to Moth while a woman with a baby slung across her asleep like a limp question holds a clipboard and a cup of coffee and does not spill either. The sky in the photo is a sky the fold has put on to make us complacent, all syrup and tender. If I had to make a monument to exactly what I want to bring to wherever we go, it would be that rope and those hands and that cup stabilized by the muscle memory of care.\n\nWe started losing sleep on a schedule you could put in an app if anyone could stand inventing another app. Dana\u2019s ears got sharp around one in the morning; she would show up with a hoodie inside out and a piece of metal clamped in her teeth to chew. Kieran turned into a person you could only talk to by writing on his arm and he would look down and find your sentence and then answer you in a sketch that looked like it had already been in the air for days. Sana laughed more and it scared me how much I wanted to bring her tea because tea is the only thing I can make that pretends to be professional. Arroyo stopped wearing the rank jacket altogether and built a little shelf by the gym door for people to leave their rings on while they carried water and his hands got used to handing back gold and silver with the kind of respect churches used to teach. Jun got two white hairs that he looked at in the mirror like prizes. Tam learned to sleep in chairs like a man on a train with his head tipped forward and his mouth open and no concern for his own dignity because home had been relocated to the corner of a table.\n\nThe night the moth came down in a new way, the wind wasn\u2019t bad. That\u2019s the thing I have learned that I keep wanting to put on billboards and can\u2019t: most days now will not announce themselves as big in the way your body expects big to show up. We had two lines on it, one literal, one the string that goes between a group of people when they\u2019re doing something dumb carefully. It had been writing numbers down its tether as if Xs were love letters and we were gossip mongers with stacks of stationary. Then it stopped writing and we all looked up like bad dogs. It drifted sideways the way a person drifts at a party when they are done being polite. The mesh hummed in a bad key. Nobody shouted because the station remembers what shouting is for. Lo and Arroyo and two school custodians with matching shoulders walked to the edge the way you walk to the edge of a lake you\u2019re going to jump into because your cousin dared you, calm, breath like a man counting the paces of a driveway. They hauled hand over hand and the rope came in with a wobble that made my teeth chatter because my body loves the wrong things. When the moth came over the lip, it smelled like pennies and then like peach skin and then like a chandelier that had tried too hard at a wedding. We set it down on blankets and went on with our lives because the best way to make something unmagical in the good sense is to put it on a blanket and hand it a cup of water.\n\nFive days later a school sent us a gift that made me think we might be able to become the kind of people who deserve gifts. They had found a way to tell a town that the sky was rehearsing without triggering fear so intense it would get in the way of the smaller duties. The announcement was a sound, and then a color on phones that had a battery, and then a chalk mark on a door that had no electricity and still could be read as easily as a book. It was three lines long and written like a diabetic\u2019s shopping list: stay in; breathe so your bones hear; sing if you must. We laughed because they had stolen our line and then we sent them bread because stealing is the sincerest form of food. The blowout-hair man tried to trademark Stay In and was told no even by the people who like to say yes to men with watches. It was a stupid victory. I put it on the wall anyway.\n\nI thought the first big fight would be obvious, a man with a speech and a banner and a flag he had ironed. It came as a woman with good teeth and a smile that had convinced people to buy vitamins. She came to a hub with a crew and did not go to the ear or the insulin or the sock table. She went to the line where we were matching people who hate meetings with their first ten meetings and said loudly that we were going to put people on lists. She said we were going to put stickers on doors. She said the word loyalty like it had ankles she could grab. She used my name like a game piece she was moving on a board she\u2019d brought. People looked at me and I looked at my hands because if I had lifted them the words would have been ugly.\n\nTam laughed once, not loudly, but with the clarity of a bell in a station. She walked to the sock table and held up a sock, the ugliest one because it had a cartoon that had not aged well. \u201cWe\u2019re putting socks on feet,\u201d she said, and the room turned toward the true thing because the true thing had been held up like a flag. \u201cWe\u2019re putting water in buckets. We\u2019re putting kids in circles where they can hum without the sky noticing. If you need a list, you can have one; it will be shopping. It will say lemons. It will say tape. It will say dignity.\u201d The crowd laughed and then applauded and the woman\u2019s smile turned into the kind you put on when you lose at monopoly, and I remembered to breathe because Tam had handed me the rope again without making me feel less for needing it.\n\nWe wrote a kinder rule on the wall that night because the mean rules were breeding too easily: Give people a job they can finish in an afternoon. Don\u2019t let them go home with a list that spans months. Feed them or they will eat their fear. Holm added in small letters, Pay them if you can in money, not coupons, and I hugged her around the shoulders and she stiffened like a person not used to being touched casually and then allowed herself to melt in stages until it was over and she didn\u2019t have to acknowledge it.\n\nI got sick, which is not heroic and also a plot device I resent, and which happened because bodies are rude. It wasn\u2019t a sky sickness or a fold cold; it was the old friend who shows up when you\u2019ve been sleeping in a chair and licking stale coffee off your teeth. Fever hung from me like a necklace I couldn\u2019t unclasp. For two days the hubs ran without me, which is how I learned that a good job is one where you can vanish and the thing continues. Tam sat beside the couch reading a manual about pressure cookers in case we needed to sterilize instruments and every once in a while read a line aloud and I would laugh and cough and then say, \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone build a mouth,\u201d and she would say, \u201cWe put that in the code, you are not that special,\u201d and I would sleep again. Velez stationed itself across the room like a lamp that could ward off thieves, and Jun wrote on my wall in pencil and then erased it when I complained about the mess and then wrote again because he knows me better than I do.\n\nOn the third day the fever snapped like a bad string and I woke to the sound of brooms on a gym floor and Sana telling someone to hold the funnel less like a weapon and more like a promise. The window showed a morning that was pretending to be ordinary and I made coffee with my hand shaking and spilled half of it on my notes, which felt like a blessing if you have ever been the kind of person who wants to ruin her own writing so she can move on. The map by the plant had grew new lines that I hadn\u2019t drawn, and I didn\u2019t ask who had added them because the point of a map is not ownership. It is consent.\n\nWe took the Moth out again that afternoon to get it back on the horse it didn\u2019t know it had fallen off and because sometimes our tools are more anxious than we allow. The angels made themselves small, which is their signal they intend humility, and the sky was a kind of blue that had just learned to miss something. We sang the song for Ridgetone like we were family who had learned to be on time for once, and the ear tugged against its lines and then lifted the way my heart lifted when I heard a particular laugh in a crowd. A child asked if the fold would be mad if we used it and I said, \u201cI think it is a door learned by a hand; it likes to be useful,\u201d and the child said, \u201cI don\u2019t like being useful,\u201d and I said, \u201cMe either, but the pay is good if you mean sleep,\u201d and he looked at me like I had not earned that joke yet and went back to counting knots in the rope.\n\nWe started a newsletter because the part of me that wants to be a librarian will not be silenced entirely, and called it Buckets & Bells because acronyms are banned and also because any other title would have been an apology. We printed it on paper because phones are luxury pets now and because paper travels through hubs like water. We put lists in it that mattered and stories that kept those lists from acquiring the over-seriousness of a memo. We published the recipe for the chaotic pie Mrs. Davila makes when the room has been too righteous and she is under orders to put jam into adults and a crust on their tongues. We published a cartoon of an angel holding a jacket flat and people cut it out and taped it next to their hooks and I went into a stairwell and let my knees do the thing they do.\n\nToward the end of the month that cannot be named anymore because the months had given up their loyalties, the sky rehearsed at noon. It was worse because people were in the middle of tasks that could not withstand interruption without becoming humiliation. A woman carrying a stack of trays remembered that she had once dropped a stack of plates in a restaurant and been yelled at so sharply she had gone to the bathroom and thrown up and learned then how to keep her hands steady when catastrophe wanted to have sex with shame. She did not drop the trays now. Men on a scaffolding sat down like they had been made ninety suddenly and grinned at each other as if they were finally allowed to admit fear was a warm animal and not a snake. A boy put his finger on a page in a book and did not lose his place, and I wanted to put that in a museum that would still be standing when this was over.\n\nWe made a library of smells at Sana\u2019s insistence because she is the only one among us who knows you cannot build a ship without building what it will think is food. She tacked strips of cloth on a board and labeled them with numbers and grimaces. Resin taught grief. Lake taught forgiveness. Meat tried to pretend it had never hurt anyone. Bread came from six kitchens and we kept them separate because merging good things too early is how you make them into a paste. We collected dust from under a hundred beds and found trace elements of shame and sex and sleep and decided to catalog all of it because ships will need to know who we were and because catalogs make people behave. We taped the board next to the ears on the wall with a line that said nose training because there is nothing wrong with being exactly what you are.\n\nThat night a priest and a woman who claimed to be an exorcist and a scientist who builds quiet fans got into a fight about whether the fold would appreciate a blessing, and I hid behind a stack of chairs and pretended to be a chair. The debate got not stupid but loud, and the angels dimmed in the way we have come to understand as their version of rolling their eyes. The exorcist said a word in a language my body recognized and winced, and the scientist said drag coefficient five times and made gestures in the air that I swear moved a breeze, and the priest said a sentence so kind it made me suspicious of his knees. We blessed the Moth because refusing to bless a thing is how you make a hole in a room that drafts. We blessed it with caution and seasoning salt and a line drawn in chalk so no one would walk under the line and be mad about superstition later. It came home that night smelling like the page of a book you have kept pressed to your face for just a second too long and I thought, we are all learning how to hold.\n\nWhen I write \u201cwe have a plan\u201d now I mean we have a plan like a person has a recipe written by a grandmother who eyeballed everything and refused to tell you the oven temperature because she knew you would learn from the way the kitchen smelled. We have ears and we have hubs and we have one moth and we have a pledge and a broom schedule and a No Mouths wall. We have lines on maps that are being redrawn by a river with new ideas. We have a woman who tapes up the flyers that say HUM PRACTICE and also a woman who comes to tear them down because she hates singing and I am glad she exists because voices like hers keep us from becoming a cult. We have angels who cannot go and a list of names of people who will. We have a shoplifted cooler and a freezer indicted and redeemed. We have stolen sleep and stolen lemons and a boy who told me my jokes were not yet earned. We have an old station breathing again and a golf course that lets me count the times I have been made to stand still and survive it.\n\nWe do not have ships. We do not have a perfect way to choose who will go first when the time comes. We have trial runs and prayers we will not call prayers because labels are expensive and I am saving money. We have the first call from a small town on a coast I used to think of as vacation that says the water came up the street and did not knock. We have the second call from a hospital that says their windows are making a friend of light and is that bad, and our answer is yes and also excellent, can we visit. We have my mother\u2019s sandwich in my mouth like the memory of salt and we have my father\u2019s measuring tape running across a table the size of seven kitchens put together, and somewhere inside both those truths is a place big enough for a moth and small enough for a hand.",

You could walk three blocks with your eyes shut and name what kind of building you were next to by the pitch of the knocking: low for stages disassembled and repurposed as shelves, bright for sheet metal turned into frames, fussing little taps for the kind of work that needs fingers more than forearms. Buckets & Bells started printing on both sides of the page, which felt like evolution and thrift at once. We declared the next seven days No Mouths Week and the kids made chalk circles outside every ear room with the pledge written around them in letters that ran out of space and doubled back like small brave snakes. The rules wall in the gym had begun to look like the inside of a teenager\u2019s locker, all stickers and authority, but it worked better than anything else we had: you could point at Dignity and then point at the stack of paper gowns and people would take the gowns without rehearsing shame.\n\nA stadium out by the river that had been empty since the team left became a dry port without anyone announcing it. People rolled in from the spine of the state with their trunks full of seed and their mouths full of news and their backs full of ideas about distance. We called the kits that left that place hearths because calling them packages made people imagine coupons and we needed kitchens. Each kit was a careful little list in a crate: a crank that didn\u2019t mind wet hands, a bell tuned to a note that made people stand up without wanting to fight, a binder labeled with handwriting you wanted to trust, a tarp the color of hope if you had never seen the ocean, and a sleeve of stitched meta that had learned to be humble. The best part was that by the time the second batch went out, they came back with additions we hadn\u2019t ordered: a scarf woven by a grandmother that made the ear behave better in wind; a whistle someone had carved from PVC that worked only when held by a left-handed person and thus became everyone\u2019s favorite; a recipe stapled to the inside cover for beans that tasted like wealth even when nothing in the pot could be counted as fancy. I watched the kit move from our hands into hands that had calluses I had never earned and felt the relief that is letting go without dropping.\n\nCity Hall tried to create a box to keep all this inside and to their credit the box was at least transparent. Holm called it a Civic Commons Charter because she knows how to make a thing sound inevitable and kind at once. It was a handful of promises written without commas and three sentences forbidding the exact kind of theft we had seen attempted in suits and in prayer shawls: no ownership of ears; no privatizing songs; no putting a ribbon on angel light and calling it brand. A councilman with shoes you could shave in gave a speech about oversight as if it were a vitamin you need to crush into applesauce to tolerate, and Holm said over the top of him, not shouting but with that tone she keeps in a pocket, \u201cWe are not deregulating kindness.\u201d We signed in the station because paper matters still, and then we put the signed paper on the wall where anybody could draw a mustache on it if they wanted, and nobody did which felt like a small miracle in a city that used to live on graffiti.\n\nThe fold came to a hospital like a rumor that walked in the front door and paid at the desk. It was noon, which felt like an insult because everyone had jobs at noon. The elevators stopped in between opinions about floors. A gurney drifted sideways as if the ground had changed its mind about left. The new ear room we had wedged into an old chapel took the hit like a good aunt, all open arms and low humming, and people who had been taught to keep feelings outside tools put their palms against the silk so their bones would make the sound travel the right way. The windows whispered, a sound like paper prep in a classroom, and every nurse in the place thought about the night they had been handed a tray for the first time and been told not to tilt. A man died, not from the sky doing theater but because his heart had been practicing to leave anyway, and we stopped everything we were doing and learned how to do funerals without making a false shape out of loss. We wrote on the wall later, in a corner where grief could pretend to be private, Funerals will be human even when we are busy. We will say names. We will not turn anybody into a motto. We will feed the mourners cake they do not have to thank us for.\n\nMoth came back twice with salt and then once with a powder that wasn\u2019t salt and made Sana sit down, which is a more reliable measurement than anything she could have written on a board. The new stuff made a soft clinking noise when you breathed too near it, as if there was an inside that wanted out but remembered itself in time. Under the scope it looked like small cities that had planned their own suburbs with better taste than ours. Kieran suggested, in a voice that he didn\u2019t trust yet, that this could be the shape of oxygen finding something to live with, and we stood around and waited for the air not to betray us with the smell of false hope. Sana did the idiot-proof tests first because she is an angel by practice and a scientist by job: she put a leaf near it and the leaf didn\u2019t curl; she put a flame near it and it didn\u2019t leap; she put her own curiosity near it and it snapped at her and she smiled and wrote don\u2019t trust, then later wrote trust enough to try again. We wrote a new line that felt like a prayer we could admit: We might not need domes if we learn to sit with the weather.\n\nAt home the pressure cooker made a sound like a building that knows its purpose and is satisfied. Tam learned to talk to the hissing the way she talks to me when I am about to bolt: with patience and laughter as if neither were hard. She made a stew out of what the hub had left, which means it tasted like generosity and cumin, and she watched me eat it like she was checking for leaks. We spoke about after as if it were a town we had been to as kids and had to find on a different map. Jun came in with hair like a good idea and a spreadsheet he had printed so I could look at it without screens. He had made a gift matrix because he is the only person I have ever met who believes that gratitude should have columns. It asked questions like who did you thank this week with your mouth and who did you thank with your hands and who did you avoid thanking because you think it will make them ask for more. He stuck it to the fridge with a magnet shaped like a tomato and I loved him with the kind of suddenness that makes you want to run a lap around your own apartment to get rid of the extra electricity.\n\nThe blowout-hair man opened a pop-up with lights and tried to sell admissions to a mouth built behind blackout curtains. It was in a warehouse that used to make fake snow and now made memory problems. He called it The Way and if I\u2019d had the energy I\u2019d have sued his graphic designer for crimes against meaning. A teen took a photo and sent it to Lo and Lo sent it to the group thread with a picture of her anchor tattoo and the words not on my route, and ten minutes later Arroyo and two door people and a cluster of aunties arrived to stand in the doorway and do the steady stare that makes even men with clipboards admit their mothers taught them better. A man in a hat told us we were suppressing innovation and I said, without raising my voice, \u201cJukeboxes are innovation. Doors that swing one way are traps,\u201d and the auntie with the best earrings wrote in lipstick on the loading dock in letters as tall as shame: No Kings. We repainted it later, not because anyone told us to but because the statement deserved better paint.\n\nVelez came to the station and stood so still you could mistake it for sculpture, which meant it had learned it would be listened to without arranging a scene. It said ships must be shaped like agreements, which made me laugh because I had been part of organizations that treated agreements like shoes. It said not arrows, which landed in me like a stone I would want to pick up and hold. It taught us a word, not in our mouth language, more in the way that breath learns the sound of its own threshold: sleeve. Not a tube. Not a gate. A soft length of listening we could keep open for six seconds without anything alive in it and then ten, and then maybe a minute if we were people who remembered to be small. We said the word in the station and the bells on the ear made a sound that sounded like the corner of a laugh.\n\nThe first sleeve was the color of the sky when a bruise is thinking about itself. We built it in the station where the ceiling had learned to ask a question. It was stitched by six women who had never met before that week and now shared pins like recipes. We hung it from a rig that Lo\u2019s bus barn had donated after someone used a correct mixture of sincerity and cookies, and the rig had the good sense to confess its limits. The sleeve hung like laundry, which made me want to cry because I could not stand how domestic the apocalypse had become on its best days. We did not put anything through it except air and then a stream of scent and then the sound of the song which is also weight. We held the rig while the sky did its tiny training pushups. The sleeve tightened the way we do when someone we don\u2019t know walks too close. The smell that slid back was not lake and not bread and not anything in our library. It was the smell of a page just before you turn it when you know the next paragraph will hurt and you keep going anyway. We wrote Sleeve behaves, Day 1, and then we went home and slept as if we had a teacher.\n\nI started telling people no more often, which I suppose is what happens when you are asked for a full-time yes. I stopped going to the meetings where people wanted me to bless their plans with my eyebrows. I started showing up at places where my body would remind me why bodies are the first technology we learn: the barber shop that had grown a phone-charging station out of a shelf of aftershaves, the laundromat where the exorcist had taken a night job and folded socks in pairs as an act of mercy, the diner where the coffee had started tasting like it used to because a kid had gotten good at cleaning the machine. In each, someone would hand me a note to tape to the wall or a lemon or a clip for my hair that had a piece missing and I would hold the broken thing and say thank you as if the thank you were glue.\n\nHolm got yelled at by men who had never learned to find their daughters at a hub without a map and I watched her take the yelling with the face you wear when you\u2019re waiting for the water to boil and someone else is trying to tell you which bubble is legal. She stood on the stairs at City Hall and told a man in a hat who wanted the word loyalty written large over the doors to the hubs that the word neighbor had more letters and more hands in it. She took a call in the stairwell about trucks we needed to move refrigerators we had borrowed from a closing ice cream place and I saw her smile a smile I will never forget because it was how a person looks when the world finally matches the list they have been keeping in a pocket for a decade. I brought her tea with a wedge of lemon because Jun was on a campaign for citrus and she drank it without remarking on my attempt at ministering and then said, \u201cDo we have a plan for babies,\u201d and I said, \u201cWe have ten,\u201d and truthfully we had four and a half and a woman named Bee who had found a way to sterilize bottles in a crockpot and whose name made me feel like we were going to be okay.\n\nThere was a day when every dog in the city barked for thirty-seven seconds and then stopped and sat down and looked guilty. We wrote it on the wall under a heading called Animal News and then we watched for anything else that had a rhythm and the only thing that matched was that every dishwasher that still worked in the city hiccuped the same hiccup at the same time. We decided to not anthropomorphize dishwashers out loud in public and then did it in the stairwell anyway. Sana circled the time on her chart and drew an arrow to a dip on a graph that made my stomach do a reasonable thing: it refused to turn into story. We have learned to only story after counting and I wish that were a habit I had learned earlier in a different life that did not require so many people to stand still in gyms while their bones learned to sing.\n\nWe took Moth out with candy in our pockets because we had finally admitted that small sugar at the right instant turns certain men into the children they used to be and makes them better at ropes. A second sleeve went up and the sky did not insult our work with calm; it pushed just enough to examine our stitching. We braced and did not perform. I thought about my driver like a talisman and put my hands in my pockets so I wouldn\u2019t reach for it and make a scene. The song of Ridgetone turned in the sleeve like soup and came back thicker and I watched three teenagers look at each other and decide they were going to live long enough to make new harmonies even if they never left the ground. We do not brag, we put our hands on the rig and say thank you without choosing a subject.\n\nNews came from the coast that had once been for postcards. The water had taken a street without knocking, and the hub had done the thing it is designed to do if we tell it to: it became a porch. The ear hung near the ceiling and sang in a key the town had not practiced and the town hummed in a key it had, and between those two truths the folding did not break anybody that day. We wrote a new line on the wall in the hand of the woman who had called it in: The porch is a science. We underlined it twice because it felt like a sentence the future was going to come back to and ask us to explain with chairs.\n\nThe first real bad, the kind with teeth, came wearing our own handwriting. In a neighborhood that had beat us to building an ear they also built a schedule and then they fell in love with their own clipboard. They started refusing people who could sing because they couldn\u2019t spell pledge. Someone taped a sign that said MEMBERS ONLY and I went very still in the way that tells me I am about to be mean if I don\u2019t swallow. I did not go. Lo went, because Lo has the voice mothers recognize as equal and the patience of a person who has driven a bus through five types of weather. She stood with her anchor wrist and her binder and said, \u201cNo one can trademark humming,\u201d and then she read our charter out loud in the slow voice you reserve for bedtime stories and traffic court and by the third sentence a man with a badge on a lanyard started to cry because badges don\u2019t fit in mouths and his tongue knew it. We wrote, later, in a different color, Don\u2019t become your own border.\n\nA scientist three time zones away sent us a new instrument she had built out of shame and copper. It listened for pressure shifts and spit out numbers like rain and I learned to love it because it didn\u2019t make any sound itself: humility you plug into the wall. She wrote in her note, in tiny letters I had to borrow a teenager\u2019s young eyes to read, Our fans keep lying to us about drag; yours tell the truth; keep the truth. I built her a small altar in my head next to my mother\u2019s jar of sugar and my father\u2019s tape that never ran out and put on it a piece of ribbon from the sleeve we had retired when a stitch gave up and we patched it with a bandana. I do not know if this is prayer. It felt like the only way to say thank you to a person I had never touched.\n\nWe were asked to speak to the world on a day that smelled like the library and I put my head down on my kitchen table because I could not stand the idea of being a mouth that big. The request came without an ultimatum and with a time window inside which everyone had agreed to stop yelling. We decided the sender was either a genius or a person who\u2019d had one good experience with silence in a yoga class and tried to give it back to the planet. Holm wanted a draft in case a microphone failed; Sana wanted three numbers to anchor it so the sky would know we weren\u2019t trying to seduce it; Jun wanted an index card with the words water, buckets, dignity, lists, no kings; Tam wanted me to wear the hoodie and not the jacket because people trust fray more than polish. Velez wanted nothing and that felt like the greatest generosity of all. I wrote on paper I had spilled stew on because I wanted the words to sit inside something that had fed me and if that isn\u2019t ritual I don\u2019t know what is. I wrote, Hello. I am a person. We have a plan, and then I wrote, Our plan is a verb. We need you to build a room for later people. It will smell like bread and resin and the first day of a school where the teacher looks at you like a name instead of a seat. Bring buckets. Bring bells. Bring a neighbor who hates this. We will be there first and last and in between. I crossed out three metaphors and kept two and went to wash my face.\n\nThe night before, the neighborhood practiced joy because it was on the schedule and I will die on the hill that scheduling joy is the only way to guarantee it happens. The gym turned into a dance not to forget but to remember that bones can move in ways that have nothing to do with fear. An angel held jackets flat from the rafters and I tried not to love the sight too much because I am trying not to become sentimental in the face of cosmic apology and failing in moderate ways daily. The sleeve hung from its rig like a line of laundry not yet taken inside because the weather was behaving like a parent after a meeting with a teacher. The fold made a small wrinkle overhead and we hummed and the wrinkle passed and no one bought a candle at a markup, which is how I measure maturity in a populace that has learned to forgive itself a few times without turning that into a hat.\n\nI slept with my driver under the bed on purpose because I wanted to feel ridiculous and domestic at once, and my body knows that feeling is the only door to sleep left to me. In my dream the fairway that is not grass opened into a field where women were laying sleeves on the ground like quilts while kids ran their hands over the seams to learn what it means to trust a stitch. The flag was not a bird that day. It was a handkerchief with a recipe written in my mother\u2019s handwriting and an apology written in Velez\u2019s light, and both of them made a kind of sense I can only experience when I am lying down. I woke at five to the sound of coffee in someone else\u2019s kitchen and the city did the slightly embarrassed shuffle of a person who has been caught practicing something tender. I stood at the window and watched the sky not break and took that as a blessing even if it meant nothing. Then I wrote on the wall, quietly so as not to wake the others, Sleep is what we give in exchange for tomorrow, and underneath it, the smallest letters I am capable of, Practice joy.",
