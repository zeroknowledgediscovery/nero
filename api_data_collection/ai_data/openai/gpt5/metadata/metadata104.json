     "novel_text": "The first time I saw the Chancellor\u2019s knuckles, I knew we had built the podium wrong.\n\nIt was a petty thought to have in the middle of a coronation speech, with a hundred camera-eyes glinting in the glass ribs above the Assembly and a thousand murmurs mercurial as rain inside the atrium. But all I could see were the pressure lines\u2014fine crescent ridges in polished wood where a silverback\u2019s weight had changed the world\u2019s ergonomics.\n\nA human architect would have assumed a human penholder, would have shaped the microphone mount to catch human spit instead of a long, soft string of drool stretched across a mouth made for bark and bite. I watched him curl his fingers, thick pads and the chalky, cracked skin at the bend of every joint, and I thought: this is how real power touches a surface.\n\n\u201cPeople of the Crown, kin and sapients,\u201d Chancellor Umboto intoned. He had trained in three languages, but his voice found its confidence in the timbre of something older, a forest drum. The autoglossers hummed just behind his words, translating for the far corners of our cantonments; signers on the dais flickered finger-words in white gloves; the throatboard at his collar picked up the rasp and made of it something smooth. \u201cWe have come, together, beyond the forest and the glass. The old hands that held whips have been unbound, and now they hold tools.\u201d\n\nSomeone tittered. Someone hissed at the titter. Human breath swam through the building and caught on the lower scaffolds where I crouched, a borrowed wrench in my palm. The podium had been fitted with two shocks, not four. The screws had been measured in millimeters and not in pressures, so the whole thing sang when the Chancellor leaned forward, a mosquito-toned shiver impossible to hear on the floor but loud as guilt up here in the bones of the place.\n\nI loosened the collar that held the east fastener and tasted the coolant in the air, bitter as apples. Above me the skylight roped light like spun sugar; beyond that, beyond the gossamer webs that held a hundred thousand tons of rain in place above the carapace of our pretty city\u2014beyond all of it there were clouds. My mother had told me once how clouds smelled when they were inside you, when you lived under them without a dome. I only knew the chemical that pretended to be cloud.\n\n\u201cPlease forgive our... youthful imperfections,\u201d the Chancellor went on, amused. He had heard the podium\u2019s whisper, or he had heard the way the whisper changed the breathing of the people, or he had learned how to sense a room like a disturbance in a pond. He opened his hands, open palm showing the heavy labyrinth of lines that an elder\u2019s hands share with a tree\u2019s cut rings. \u201cWe are still learning to stand upright without bruising each other.\u201d\n\nMy wrench slipped, my knuckles knocked iron, and a drop of my blood fell through the lattice grid into the crowd. Nobody looked up, but I flinched like I\u2019d spat on a shrine. I wiped my hand. I tightened the fastener. The podium settled by exactly a half-centimeter. The ghost-whine dimmed. The Chancellor nodded, though he couldn\u2019t have known why he nodded. The Chancellor was good at giving to the air what the air demanded. That was why he was where he was. That, and the math of armies.\n\nA hand touched my ankle. \u201cMiren. You\u2019re leaking.\u201d\n\nI looked down into Fenn\u2019s face, a comic half moon under the catwalk\u2019s edge. Fenn worked in seals and gaskets; she had hair as black as a burned gasket and eyes like someone had kept a pair of honest olives for too long in saltwater. She offered me a square of gauze. \u201cHe\u2019s nearly done.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou listen to speaches now?\u201d I whispered, taking the gauze. The blood on the steel already looked older than a minute.\n\n\u201cOnly when a gorilla learns to rhyme.\u201d Fenn smiled without her eyes. \u201cAfter this we\u2019ve got to go check the south basins. There\u2019s a pressure leap. Or maybe a rat.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a rat, tell it the apes have the floor.\u201d I tucked the gauze into my glove and tightened the second collar. The podium stopped singing. The Chancellor took a breath, and he spoke the line everyone had been waiting for, the one they had sold to sixteen feed-streams in advance for more than I would ever make in my life.\n\n\u201cFrom this day,\u201d he said, \u201csapience acknowledges itself in the mirror and swears never to turn away again.\u201d\n\nThe people clapped. The apes clapped, which is something you never forget seeing: palms that could split your ribs in half finding a polite beat. I sat back on my heels and watched the braids and flags that hung over the stage sway in the AC wind. My palm stung. Fenn had gone already, quick as a roach. I should have gone too, but I was wet with the sense of having fixed something that mattered even if it was only a noise. It\u2019s a stupid weakness: to love the little victory, to savor the screw turned exactly right. To think the world is made of such screws at all, and not of meat and hunger.\n\nAt the edge of the dais, a young bonobo in a stiff, pale jacket held a tablet with both hands and looked like he wanted to throw up. His lips fluttered. He swallowed, looked out at the crowd and then at the Chancellor and then at nothing, then back like he might ask permission. The Chancellor turned to him and rested one massive hand on the younger ape\u2019s shoulder. They held each other\u2019s gaze. The Chancellor nodded, small, as if to say: it is terrifying to speak, but we are beyond terror. The young bonobo breathed again. He found his voice. Slowly, careful, he told us a law that was new. The law said what it needed to say to keep this city tall.\n\nBy the time it was over and everyone was pulling on their coats, I had wiped my hand again and counted the extra ticks in the AC\u2019s east vent and tried twice to pretend that I had no reason to look for someone in the bodies below. The someone looked for me anyway.\n\nHe loomed. He had always loomed. He even tried to stoop when he came up under the catwalk, but it only made his shoulders look wider. He opened his arms.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t pick a better time to cut yourself,\u201d Uncle Harun said, grinning, and then, as I made a face, \u201cMiren. Let me see.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. The Chancellor\u2019s podium. A love bite.\u201d\n\nHe took my hand and turned it palm-up. He was not a medic but he had worked as one for twenty years in a clinic that pretended it wasn\u2019t there; he had set bones with wire and sutured under lanterns and held children with fevers like dynamite. His fingers were elegant and stupidly strong. \u201cSo? Are we in love now?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get ugly,\u201d I said, even as he blew on the scrape and the cooler air made it sting cleanly again. I pulled out of his grip. \u201cWhy are you here? You hate crowds. You especially hate ceremonies. Your text said: green beans, thirteen hundred, corner of Glass Row. This is not green beans.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m not allowed to be surprised by pomp?\u201d His eyes were the color of dark tea. The hair at his temples had gone white in just six months, like a lightning strike did it. \u201cYou\u2019re applying for the keystone tender, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nI blinked. \u201cWho told you that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d he said. \u201cYou told me without telling me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not applying. My unit is. And we\u2019re not winning. They\u2019ll give it to a firm they can shake hands with on the news. We are not... hand-shakable.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could build a mountain out of garbage and call it a temple. Don\u2019t disqualify your hands.\u201d He glanced sidewise, across the floor where aides were still ferrying glass carafes and damp cups and the last of the reporters were packing up their little insect tripods. His gaze snagged on a uniform: slate black, a gorilla\u2019s shoulders, the green thread at the cuff that meant Security Cord wept money and teeth. He released my hand. \u201cYou should see your mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is always such a casual sentence, the way you say it. Like I should see the sun.\u201d\n\nHarun flinched a little, but he nodded. He had flinched ever since the last time my mother and I were in the same room and turned the air into ash with each other. That was three years ago. \u201cShe made fig cakes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t eat fig cakes. I have work.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen just smell them. Pretend you\u2019re eight. Pretend the world doesn\u2019t tick.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cMiren. For me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d he said, and then he smiled, and I knew it was a bad day in a long corridor of bad days, and he was lying to me to keep the hour from falling apart. \u201cI just thought\u2014if we are all learning to stand upright, some of us could stand together again. Before the floor moves.\u201d\n\nI looked past him at the Chancellor. Umboto had left the podium and was swarmed by a little tide of suits and tails. He was laughing, baring those big teeth the color of old parchment, the color of bones. He saw as if his eyes were hands, and everything he touched he made warmer, and nothing ever pulled any of the old ice up from his spine. He had been a prisoner and had bitten his own tongue until he could think without screaming. He had also ordered the purge on the third day of the Red Square. He was a saint, he was a butcher. That was the truth with a capital T you couldn\u2019t say out loud if you wanted to work inside the city\u2019s skin.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go to my mother\u2019s,\u201d I said, and my uncle let out a breath as if I had unscrewed something in him that had been bound too tight.\n\nOn the way out, the Security Cord stopped us. This was not unusual in the building; they stopped everyone; the walls were there to be leaned on. The gorilla wore the kind of bespoke suit that pretends it isn\u2019t armored. He was taller than Harun, which was saying a lot. He was young, but there is a way some of them have of wearing their youth like a uniform you don\u2019t dare mess up.\n\n\u201cEngineer Kash,\u201d he said, looking at me, not at the ID in my lanyard. His iris implants clicked as they focused, and then his nostrils flared a fraction. \u201cThis the uncle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the uncle,\u201d I said, deadpan.\n\nHe smiled, short and humorless. \u201cFunny. I\u2019m Marshal Ketu,\u201d he added, as if I would need it later. Maybe I would. \u201cNext time, your work order gets locked in eight hours in advance. No repairs during addresses.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe podium was hungry for a wrench,\u201d I said. \u201cI brought food.\u201d\n\nKetu\u2019s yellow-orange eyes did not blink. Behind him, the bonobo aide from the stage past clutched a folio against his chest like it would keep his heart in place. Ketu glanced at me, then at my uncle\u2019s face as if to measure whether we were the right kind of together. He moved aside. \u201cCrown keep you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you,\u201d Harun said.\n\nI caught the gorilla\u2019s gaze as we stepped past him. My mother had said once that a long time ago if an ape looked at you that way you dropped your eyes because you knew what you were; you knew your body did not win that argument. \u201cIs the Chancellor\u2019s speech always going to make all our vents cry?\u201d I asked.\n\nKetu\u2019s mouth quirched. He had a scar that cut his upper lip, a thin white ladder. \u201cOnly when the screws are human.\u201d\n\nOutside, the city had been washed for the day. It was a ritual and a security habit: the drones sprayed and squeegeed the glass ribs and the kinetics skimmed the residual proteins off the fountains. The day glowed soft as bread. People moved like schools of sardines along the mid-walks; black banners with the Chancellor\u2019s motto snapped and sagged, snapped again; on the low buskers\u2019 shelf a trio of orangutans, children really, practiced a violin piece, fingers so precise you forgot the hands that belonged to them.\n\nHarun and I walked down the different. He smelled like cloves, always, even when he forgot to brush his hair. We passed a kiosk that sold insects fried in honey oil. A man with scars on both cheeks kissed the last piece in a packet before he ate it. I can\u2019t explain why that image stayed, but it did. We crossed a sunstripe of warmth. We took the stairs to Glass Row because the lifts would be full. Somewhere above us, a choir sang the old human song about morning on the river. They sang it so carefully you could tell they were being watched.\n\nAt my mother\u2019s door, Harun straightened his jacket. He knocked the way he always did: three soft, then one hard, like a joke inside a warning. We heard pots clump, then silence, then the scrape of a chair, then her footfalls, then for some reason my heart beat against my chest like I\u2019d run. When she opened the door, nothing was wrong except that everything that had ever been wrong lived in the way she stood there holding the edge of the door like she might bite it off.\n\n\u201cMa,\u201d I said, and my mouth shaped it like a soft stone I had carried for a long time. \u201cWe\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI made fig cakes,\u201d she said, as if it had been her idea to invite us, and she turned and walked back into the apartment.\n\nI could have left then. I didn\u2019t. Harun followed me in and closed the door gently with a closeness of fingers I had inherited. He mouthed: thank you. I rolled my eyes.\n\nMy mother\u2019s place smelled like cardamom and boiled milk and the disinfectant that the clinic gave out for free. On the shelf above the cooking unit sat the collection of mugs nobody ever used except guests, the way poor people define ceremony. The window was open the tiniest bit to let the heat out. On the sill, a plant tried to stay alive by sheer will. My mother moved between skillet and board with the grace of someone who had grown a city out of dried beans. She pretended not to look at me. I pretended not to look at the way her shoulder hurt.\n\nFor five minutes we talked about canning. New lids were hard to come by. Old lids played at being new and gave you botulism. The apes had no use for canned bean paste but they had made a rule about how many lids could be in a household at once because rules breed rules. Harun told a story about a man who had used a pressure cooker as a drum and blew off his eyebrows and started a band. We touched our cups to the table. We sipped tea that was too hot to sip. The world stayed in joint one second at a time because there were rituals and small stupid lies.\n\nIt was my mother who broke the seal. She set a plate of fig cakes on the table. They were ugly and perfect, the way a fruit that does not care about human aesthetics is perfect. \u201cThey say the Cord will replace the district medics,\u201d she said to Harun without looking at him. \u201cThey say we will go to the barracks for stitches.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey say many things,\u201d Harun said. \u201cThey said my teeth would never be straight.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mother did that with string.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd a prayer. I move my mouth the way she told me to still.\u201d He bit a fig cake. \u201cMa. Let the rumors be rumors until they are walls.\u201d\n\nShe made a noise that could have been agreement or contempt. \u201cI saw him on the screen. The Chancellor. He has soft eyes. I don\u2019t trust soft eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is because you have sharp ones,\u201d Harun said, and she did not laugh, but she liked that he said it, you could see the liking go down her throat like a good tea.\n\nI ate half a fig cake to show my body it was still on my side. I looked out the window. A boy on a delivery scooter flew past so close he could have landed in her sink. Somewhere in the building a baby cried and then stopped, mid-sob, as if the person who held it had said an effective word. \u201cMa,\u201d I said, because I could feel the coil inside the silence that came now, and I had to cut it before it cut me. \u201cI have a chance to work up-tier on the keystone tender. If we get a foot in, if we just\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will not turn bolts for animals to climb out of the pit they put us in,\u201d she said, and it was the pit we both had inside us that spoke. It was also the pit in the ground where the first city had begun. \u201cYou will not give them a better stadium from which to watch us dance.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a water control lattice, not a stadium.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lattice is a fence,\u201d she said, precise, and she had been a word-precise woman before the Revolution threw its vocabulary at her head. She looked at me. It was like looking into a mirror and seeing Deeper Being looking back. \u201cDo you remember, Miren, who dropped money on your science class? Do you remember who was turned back from the market on Mondays? I do. I remember when your father still sang. Do you think the gorillas will bring that back? Do your keystones hold that kind of weight?\u201d\n\nHarun stirred like he could pull that question off the table. \u201cSosie. Let her.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet her what,\u201d she said. \u201cLet her be eaten alive slowly. We are not food.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to fight,\u201d I heard my mouth say, and it was a lie. \u201cI came to tell you. If we get the tender, I\u2019ll be up there some days of the week. You\u2019ll get a higher queue number because you\u2019re attached to my badge. I can make sure the clinic gets more kits. I can\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think I want the little gifts you took from the palace,\u201d she said in a voice that did not belong to the way she poured water for us when we were small. \u201cYou think I want my daughter to make herself a knot in the net they throw over the whole city. What will you untangle when they are done tying you.\u201d\n\n\u201cMa,\u201d Harun said gently. \u201cYour metaphors are very strong and we have tea getting cold.\u201d\n\nWe were saved by the door knock. It was that weird authoritarian knock like firmness in a suit, except it came three times and stopped and didn\u2019t announce itself again. Harun and I both heard it. My mother didn\u2019t move. She gave me a look like a coin.\n\nI got up. I opened the door. There was nobody in the hall. There was, however, a package the size of a grapefruit wrapped in waxed cloth with a string knotted in a silly bow. There was a card stuck in the knot. It was my name in wrong handwriting.\n\nI brought it in. Harun\u2019s face changed. He stood up. \u201cWho was it,\u201d he said, but he did not mean that question because there had not been a who. He had the same habit I did: making words because otherwise silence made your hands shake.\n\nI pulled the card free. Miren, the card said, and below that a single line of printed letters in the neat block of a machine: when you remember this, remember me.\n\nMy mother pursed her mouth. She had a drawer in her kitchen for mysteries. It held a green ribbon from an election, a tiny doll a child left on their doorstep, two buttons from a jacket she didn\u2019t own. \u201cDo not open that.\u201d\n\nI would have been more obedient if she had said please. I unknotted the string. The waxed cloth peeled back. It wasn\u2019t a grapefruit. It was a hinge, an old one, heavy black iron folded over itself. It had three holes for screws and one hole for something else. It had been rubbed with oil that smelled like a ghost of vinegar. It had been used for many years and then tucked away carefully, cleaned and made to remember a use it would never have again.\n\nHarun made a noise, sharp as a laugh, but not a laugh. He reached for it and stopped his hand as if he saw a field of bees around it. \u201cWhere did you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was at the door,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI can see that,\u201d he said, and now we were back in our normal, good humors, except my mother\u2019s face. She had gone pale around the eyes, a paleness that meant the memory under the memory under the ritual had opened its mouth. \u201cThat hinge,\u201d he said, and he sat down as if a weight had been placed on his shoulders and he could not buck it off. \u201cThat hinge was from Red Stairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are being dramatic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am being accurate,\u201d he said. \u201cThat hinge held a door that held a room that held something that the Cord would like very much not to talk about.\u201d\n\nMy mother stood up so fast her chair fell. She did not pick it up. \u201cYou will both leave,\u201d she said, and the way she said it meant it was the only way memory could keep her lungs working. \u201cTake your hinge. Go.\u201d\n\n\u201cMa,\u201d I said, but Harun was already on his feet, the hinge in his hands now, astonished by its weight.\n\n\u201cShe is right,\u201d he said to me, without looking away from my mother because the two of them could pull entire trains with their gaze when they wanted to. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving. Sosie. Thank you. I\u2019ll bring her back later. Or I won\u2019t. It was good to smell your tea.\u201d\n\nWe left. We could have stayed and argued and broken our bones on the usual rocks. We left. In the hallway, Harun breathed out, then in, and only then, weirdly, he laughed. \u201cHinges,\u201d he said, to the air. \u201cThey think they\u2019re being subtle. They always do this, they\u2019re always making a game of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cPeople who write notes and pretend they don\u2019t know you were going to open them anyway.\u201d His hand shook. The hinge made no sound when it rocked. \u201cI told you the floor was going to move. Miren. I need to show you something. No. I need to say something and I need you to listen without talking until I am done. Do you think you can do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cTry.\u201d\n\nWe went down two flights and across to a service stair nobody used except the maintenance crew and the very tired. It smelled like old rain. Harun sat on the step and set the hinge down next to his shoe like a dog. He looked at his hands. Then he looked at me.\n\n\u201cThere are things we keep in days,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there are things we keep in bodies. There are things we keep in cities. Sometimes a city learns how to keep secrets the way a body does, by building a skin around them and feeding them.\r\n\n\u201cThere is a thing in this city, Miren\u2014a piece of code and a piece of prayer, married, that we built when we were losing and thought we had lost everything. I say we as if I were the one with the original idea but I was a carrier. I carried it behind my teeth for thirty months. When the purge was done, we needed a way to make sure the next purge never happened. So we wrote a lock.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the lock the Chancellor can\u2019t open if the people he\u2019s about to poison don\u2019t speak the word. It\u2019s the lock that makes the vents breathe in and not out. It\u2019s the lock the Red Stairs boys died to nest inside the keystone. It\u2019s the lock that holds the valve that holds the perfect storm. I am being confusing. I know. I am making words walk down a thin bridge and not fall. Forgive me.\u201d\n\n\u201cPut... why are you telling me this.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause,\u201d he said, and now he laughed again, a horrible laugh like a cough. \u201cBecause they put it in me. And they left a map of it in hinges and fig seeds and songs that only your mother still knows by heart. Because when I die, the lock breaks unless someone who understands how to use both a wrench and a mouthbody eats\u201d\u2014he flinched as he said it, his eyes went away from me then back because he couldn\u2019t not look\u2014\u201cwhat the lock is stored in. Do you understand me.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t. That is, my mind understood the words and the pictures they painted, little cartoons of absurdity. The truth, that lived lower, did not accept that its job would ever require teeth.\n\n\u201cTell me you are lying,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI would never lie to you,\u201d he said immediately, and it was so quick and clean that I believed him and I hated him with love for it.\n\n\u201cYou would lie to me a thousand times if it kept me in one piece,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he admitted, and he smiled a little, the way a sailor might smile as he throws up, because he knows land exists and he does not know he will see it again. \u201cBut not this time. You told me once you wanted to be an engineer because the world made sense as soon as you understood where the forces traveled. I am telling you where they travel. I am telling you that the Chancellor\u2019s pretty keystone is a trap we built for somebody worse with his face but not his hands.\u201d He touched the hinge. \u201cIt\u2019s a lock that has to know the person who opens it is family. That knowledge lives in the gut. That was the choice we made when we were animals trying to become human again.\u201d\n\nMy skin went hot and cold and hot again like water with a mind. I put my head in my hands. I laughed, small and ugly and mean. \u201cThat is absurd.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is. Imagine. I signed off on it. I used a false name but it was still my signature. It was that or building a god we could never turn off. We did both, really.\u201d He squeezed his eyes shut. \u201cI have been telling myself I could keep you away from this. That I could\u2014if I kept my hands clean and stopped seeing you at the clinic and never came to your mother\u2019s door again and aged correctly\u2014 then this would happen after and without you. But they sent the hinge. That means they think I flinch. That means they think sending you a toy will push me into the street. They are not wrong. I run on metaphor like a clock. I am a man made of hinges. You are too. I am sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t... I can build a new lock. With numbers. With a password that is not a\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey kill numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey always do. You can see it. They kill numbers and call it security. There is a reason we chose meat. Meat is complicated in a way they will never be comfortable with.\u201d\n\nI thought about the Chancellor\u2019s knuckles on the wood. I thought about the baby down the hall. I thought about my mother\u2019s face when she saw the hinge. I thought about Marshal Ketu\u2019s mouth when he said only when the screws are human.\n\n\u201cYou even know if it works,\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWe tested it,\u201d he said. A shadow moved through his expression like a big fish. \u201cOn the worst day I ever had. It did. It does. It will. If we get to the moment and there is no mouth that can say the word that is both word and oxygen, then the city will breathe in, and everything scarce will stay where scarce hides. If we get to the moment and there is you, then\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I will have eaten my own uncle,\u201d I said, somehow like a joke, because sometimes the only way to put a thing in the skin is to put more iron in your voice than your blood. \u201cIn order to say a word to a machine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will make sure you hate me by then,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it will not be so\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cStop.\u201d I stood up. I had been sitting on the cold step like I had nowhere else. I had a thousand elsewheres. None of them were real. \u201cStop talking like you know arithmetic for this. You don\u2019t. Nobody does.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just decided on a sum. We hope the answer doesn\u2019t end us.\u201d He looked up at me and his hand twitched like he wanted to touch my shoe for balance. He didn\u2019t. \u201cYou see why we should never have built keystones in the first place, by the way. The city should be a thousand little mistakes you can fix with string.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big one with flags.\u201d I was breathing too much. I was not breathing enough. I was in and then out of my body like a tourist. \u201cWhy now. Why the hinge now. If the lock is sleeping, if the city isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re rearranging the angels,\u201d Harun said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I got a whisper at market this morning. The Cord is moving engineers. The Chancellor is moving the Chancellor. There is someone among the apes who wants to be king of the ghosts. In that shuffle, somebody remembered we exist.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think I can handle this.\u201d It was not a question I meant to ask.\n\n\u201cI know you can,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I wish I didn\u2019t. It makes me feel like a terrible person.\u201d\n\nI sat again because my knees decided that argument. Harun lifted the hinge into his lap. He stroked it with a thumb, the way you touch a dog to calm yourself down. We sat like that, two scraps of bone in a stairwell, until voices scuffed above our heads again and a child cried somewhere and then I laughed once more because it is ridiculous that a stairwell can hold both this particular apocalypse and some delivery guy\u2019s need to pee.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, after a space, and my voice sounded like someone had poured gravel into it and then put it through a sieve. \u201cSay you die. Say I\u2014say I do what you want like I have ever done what anybody\u2014 fine. Say somehow. Then what? I go where? I say what? Do I write it down,\u201d and the laugh slipped out from under the words, \u201cBecause I am a good student? You have a manual.\u201d\n\nHe patted his jacket. He took out a folded square of soft, filthy paper that I recognized before he unfolded it and my heart forgot what to do. It was the diagram he had drawn for me when I was twelve of a water cycle with little arrows and pictures of clouds and a ridiculously smug sun. He had added to it, one small neat drawing at a time, with a pen so fine it made you think it wasn\u2019t real. There were, now, not only clouds and rain but vents and sparger valves and a little man with a wrench that looked suspiciously like me standing on a grate.\n\n\u201cGods,\u201d I said, because sometimes that is the right language. \u201cYou hid a poem under my homework.\u201d\n\nHe put the diagram on his knee and tapped one corner. \u201cGo here when I tell you,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kind of here that moves. You\u2019ll get a call. You will hate the person who calls. They will laugh at you. Keep them on the line. They will tell you how to get to the bone. Listen for the word cline. Do not send a message to your mother. She will know anyway. Put pebbles in your pocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy pebbles.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you remember that your body holds eleven kilograms of stone at any given time,\u201d he said, absolutely straight-faced. \u201cIt helps.\u201d Then he smiled, just with the corner of his mouth. \u201cNo. Because the alarms think pebbles are interesting and they look away from flesh when the bags jingle. It\u2019s stupid but it works. People build machines like they are afraid of coins.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to go,\u201d I said, standing again and realizing I couldn\u2019t feel my feet. \u201cI have to go to work. We have a real pressure jump. If I don\u2019t go, someone drowns. If I go, maybe I drown later. Why is the world made of this kind of math.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause God was an engineer but not a very good one,\u201d Harun said mildly, standing too, folding the diagram back into its pretend-childhood and tucking it into his heart-pocket. \u201cBecause we are apes. Because we made our own gods and some of them want to be sturdy and some of them want to be adored. Go.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome by later,\u201d I said. \u201cFor the beans. I\u2019ll make a stew that fights back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will try,\u201d he said. He patted the hinge. He picked it up and tucked it under his arm like a ridiculous, heavy book. \u201cYou know, you were five when you first asked me if hinges were what made the doors when doors opened, or if it was the space in between that did it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was a very annoying child.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a very annoying uncle,\u201d he said, and then his voice went very, very simple: \u201cMiren.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said, and I looked at him because I had to. He was only himself in the way that a person who has made his body into a container for other people\u2019s nonsense can be himself. He was still my uncle, with the neat way he parted his hair and his stupid love for card tricks and his soft spot for cats that made him leave tuna on his window sill even though the cats were machinelike demons that screamed at dawn, that.\n\nHe put his free hand on my shoulder. He leaned his head to the side a little like he wanted to listen to my breath. \u201cRemember that you know how to build. Remember that when you are eating grief.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop with the language,\u201d I said, because it hurt. \u201cJust\u2014 text me when you get home. And don\u2019t go anywhere stupid.\u201d\n\nHe saluted with the hinge. \u201cToo late,\u201d he said, and his grin then was real, the one that made his eyes go crooked. I almost laughed again. Then he pretended to stride off toward the lifts with the hinge like a marching band instrument. I watched him go until the stairwell\u2019s corners took him. Then I was alone with the old rain smell. Then I went to work.\n\nFenn met me at the basin and handed me a coffee I didn\u2019t ask for. The basin had a fresh set of hairline cracks like a spider had made a glass home. The pressure numbers sulked like misbehaving children. We stood thigh-deep in the noise of water pretending to be solid. Fenn\u2019s mouth was set. The tiny scar at her temple from when she walked into a machine guard without looking stood out white. She was the only person I could say everything to and trust it would not fall out of her like a drawer cracked open. I didn\u2019t say everything. I said: \u201cMy mother made fig cakes.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell her I said they were rude.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the Chancellor,\u201d she said, because she liked to collect every piece of a day and put it on a table. \u201cHe said he was learning to stand upright. Imagine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey always do that,\u201d I said. \u201cThey rehearse a fall.\u201d\n\nShe glanced at me. \u201cWhat happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy uncle handed me an apocalypse in a stairwell.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d she said, and she tipped her head to one side in that way she had when I gave her one of my sentences. \u201cBig day.\u201d\n\n\u201cBig day.\u201d I knelt near the long crack and pressed three fingers against the cool. \u201cYou feel that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll sleeve it. And I\u2019ll sleep on it. And if it moves, they will kill numbers.\u201d\n\nShe blew out a breath. \u201cYou are speaking clockwork again. You want me to get the good seal or the expensive seal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the same.\u201d I wept a little as I laughed, because some days the city gives you a pun and you have to use it or you\u2019ll never get a better one. \u201cFenn. Do you ever\u2014 how long do you think any of this is going to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019re in your head,\u201d she said gently, and she set her machine box down and stood at my side. She tucked a strand of hair behind my ear with a dirty knuckle. We are not lovers. We are not anything people can measure. She is one of the ropes that keep me from falling off the ship. \u201cWe fix, Miren. It is our glorious curse. That is all. If none of this lasts, they can bury us with beautiful wrenches.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to be buried with a stupid hinge,\u201d I said, and that made my rib cage feel like a bad instrument again. Fenn put her shoulder against mine so that if I leaned, my body would not ask the floor to catch me.\n\nWe worked. The water made its machine song. Somebody\u2019s child in another unit sang along. At one point my phone hissed and showed me a text from an unknown number with one word, lunch?, and my skin crawled because I am not brave; my body wants soft things always, and coded messages make my feet cold. I put the phone face-down. I held a sleeve in place while Fenn glued it to the world. I thought of Harun with the hinge under his arm like a clumsy instrument, walking into the light like a fool. I thought of Marshal Ketu whose scar was a line, who would find me if I made the wrong shadow. I smelled figs in my hair, cardamom on my clothes, the AC\u2019s faint metallic.  \n\nAt shift end, the basin held. We marked a calendar. We put away our tools like soldiers or like mothers. Fenn bumped my hip with her hip. \u201cStew that fights back,\u201d she said. \u201cInvite me.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d I said. \u201cBring an instrument that isn\u2019t a hinge.\u201d\n\nShe laughed. Then she put two fingers to my wrist and felt my pulse like a medic. \u201cHe\u2019ll text,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s too vain not to.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s late.\u201d The clock said six. The clock said the day had gotten on the shuttle he wasn\u2019t supposed to take. I kept the phone facedown like it could poison me.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a man,\u201d she said, like that explained tardiness at an atomic level. \u201cGo home. Eat something. If you stare at a door, it does not open faster.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes it does,\u201d I said, my voice so thin it could have cut bread. \u201cSometimes the hinges\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cEnough with the\u2014 go.\u201d She kissed my cheek like a cousin and shoved me toward the ladders. \u201cText me when you turn the key.\u201d\n\nI walked home. Night had gummed its thumbprint along the edges of the buildings. The big hum of the upper-tier crawled down, a contented purr of machines which had eaten all the food and lay on their backs. I passed three men playing a game with chalk circles on the concrete and an empty bottle. The bottle made a good coyote of luck. A little boy threw water off a balcony and laughed when it turned to mist and blew back in his face. Someone cried. Someone sang the bad ape song about mangoes. Someone argued about an old election. All the heavy things and the light things of this city walked down the same street with me and didn\u2019t ask my name. Once, I glanced up at the sky and saw the faint line a lift leaves in the air when it is clean. I almost smiled. The world is rude and beautiful and built of angles that can hold a palm.\n\nMy door was the same green it had always been. My lock was keyed to my hand\u2019s pressure and my breathing rhythm, because I am paranoid and good with little machines. The door opened. The place smelled like copper and spun sugar because I had left a spool on the table and the spool was a liar. The plant in my window was dead. I had pretended for a week it was sleeping. I touched its leaf with one finger and said, \u201csorry, friend,\u201d because I am the kind of person who thanks the leaf she killed. It kept still. I went to the kitchen. I put the pot on for the stew that fights back. I cleaned a knife. I sat down with my phone. The phone did not have any messages from Uncle Harun.\n\nIt had a new text from an unknown number, exactly one word again: cline.\n\nI put the knife down carefully. I wanted to put it down so hard it made a sound. I wanted to look like the kind of person who could pick up her own uncle with her mouth and not die. I picked up the phone. I typed: wrong number, because I am bad at comedy under pressure. The phone spit back a map. The map\u2019s flight path showed me three routes through the city I had traveled only in dreams: underflesh roads and old service train skeletons and stairs that the developers had lined with fake cherry trees and then bricked over when someone died under them. It put a little red dot where I was. It put a little violet star where it wanted to see me. I stared at it until the pot hissed. I turned the gas off.\n\nI typed: who dis.\n\nThe response took six seconds. That\u2019s forever. The forever said: someone laughing. do me a favor, put pebbles in your pockets. have you eaten. bring water.\n\nI wanted to be brave. I wanted to be the person who didn\u2019t say okay to jokes with razors in them. I typed: I have pebbles. Somehow. By accident. I typed: I have not eaten. I typed: If you hurt him, I will hit you with a hinge.\n\nA smile appeared as dots. Then: i believe you. now run.\n\nI put the phone in my pocket. I put three small nails in my other pocket because I did not own pebbles. I put a bottle of water in my bag and a wrench I didn\u2019t need but I am never without wrench. I turned off the light. I turned it on again. I turned it off again. I locked the door and tested it twice. Then I was a person on a stairwell moving toward a violet star in a city that had learned how to whisper with its vents.\n\nOn the second-floor landing, I almost ran over Marshal Ketu. He was leaning against the wall with the ease of someone who had decided gravity was a friend. He stepped away from the plaster and it took on his shape before it forgave him for pressing. He looked tired in the way good soldiers look tired when a day has been long and the orders have changed.\n\n\u201cEvening,\u201d he said, softly, as if he knew there was a sleeping child behind one of these doors and he would not wake that child for any reason except the end of the world. He cleared his throat and the throatboard picked it up and it sounded like a big jar emptying. \u201cFunny thing. I was just about to knock.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any cookies,\u201d I said, and I was surprised that I sounded like me. That was good. Or not. I tucked my hands into my jacket pockets so he wouldn\u2019t see the nails. That\u2019s a lunatic sentence.\n\n\u201cWe arrested a man two hours ago,\u201d Ketu said. He looked at his hands, then back at my face. He took a breath. For the first time since I\u2019d met him, he looked uncertain. \u201cThis city has a way of giving me the wrong sensibilities. I was trained to think a certain way. The city wants me to think like a river.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you going to search my pockets for pebbles,\u201d I asked because sometimes you poke the bear to make sure it is a bear and not a bad dream.\n\nKetu\u2019s eyes flicked. He smiled, tight. \u201cI should take you in,\u201d he said, and I couldn\u2019t tell if he believed himself. \u201cOr I should warn you. Or I should ask you if you\u2019ve eaten.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not use my lines,\u201d I said, and to my own shock, he laughed.\n\n\u201cRed Stairs was always so dismissive of authority,\u201d he said, very mild. \u201cTell me, engineer. Do you think the Chancellor has soft eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he has hard ones he covers with soft ones. I think you know that. I think I have somewhere to be and you are at my door at the exact moment you shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d\n\nA voice behind one of the doors coughed. Ketu\u2019s head tilted so he could track it the way a cat\u2019s does. When he looked back at me, he had made a decision. \u201cKeep him alive,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWho,\u201d I said, playing the fool.\n\n\u201cYour uncle,\u201d he said, as if there was no point being coy between us because the city was listening and the city liked a straight story. \u201cKeep him alive as long as you can.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if I can\u2019t,\u201d I said, because I wanted him to have to own the sentence that followed.\n\n\u201cThen do what the lock wants,\u201d he said. His eyes were tired again. He rubbed his lip where the scar was. \u201cI will deny all of this,\u201d he added, for himself. For the gods. \u201cAnd if you tell your mother I stood in your hallway, she will find me in the street and make me cry.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe will,\u201d I said, honestly. \u201cShe keeps a drawer.\u201d\n\nHe blinked. He looked at the bottle in my bag. He moved aside. \u201cYou\u2019ve got three minutes before the grid maps catch up to you,\u201d he said, not to me so much as to the air. \u201cI will go the other way. You did not see me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never do,\u201d I said, and that was also true; the Cord used their bodies the way locksmiths use a tumbler: you only sense them when a door clicks. I squeezed past him and took the stairs.\n\nI don\u2019t know what it looked like from up top, the path I took. In my body, it looked like a night punched in little pieces with light. It smelled like old sugar and piss and warm metal and the cheap perfume the kids wear because its bottle has a monkey wearing a crown on it. I stepped where the map in my phone told me to step and sometimes where my feet felt like stepping because maps do not have memories and floors do. When I turned down the long hall under the holy market where they sell dead fish made out of algae and paint them to look like the old fish, a woman with hair like a nest said my name. \u201cMiren,\u201d she said, and her gums showed because her teeth were on a glass somewhere she could not reach. \u201cYour uncle owes me a drip kit.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will bring it,\u201d I said, and that felt like a prayer because I did not know if I believed any of it.\n\nAt the corner where the probate offices used to be, I stepped over a white chalk line and my phone vibrated. The violet star got bigger. The map stopped making sense and then made more sense than any map should, like a diagram of a heart pumping. The door I was supposed to use was not a door. It was a smudge in plaster. I put my fingers on the smudge. It grew into a rectangle. The rectangle took a breath. I pushed. It opened as if it had been waiting for my hands all week. All my life.\n\nInside, it was colder. There was a child\u2019s bicycle with no chain leaned against a pipe and a stack of old posters for a marching band that had never marched and a smell of my father\u2019s last shirt. A man with no hair and a nice mouth waited leaning on a dolly. He was not alone; the room was full of the kind of quiet that means twenty people are listening in the walls. He grinned at me like we had just bumped into each other in a grocery and we both needed oranges.\n\n\u201cFinally,\u201d he said. His voice was the friendliest thing I had heard all day and also the least trustworthy. He did not look like someone who ate breakfast. \u201cYou brought nails. How cute. I said pebbles.\u201d\n\n\u201cNails are pebbles that think,\u201d I said, and I was heartened by the way his grin widened. He liked that. I did, too.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, and he gestured toward a sliver of dark at the back of the room that was not a door either, but it was. \u201cBefore the Cord stops pretending to be polite. They\u2019ve got a new boy in their cage. He thinks he wants to be worse than a Chancellor. He isn\u2019t good enough. That makes him braver.\u201d He started to move the dolly and then didn\u2019t, and he held out his hand to me. It had ink stains on the pads. \u201cI\u2019m Vetch,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cHungry,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd bad at trusting men who introduce themselves as nouns.\u201d\n\n\u201cFair,\u201d he said, and he let his hand drop without making a fuss. \u201cI liked your keystone spec from last year, by the way. You wrote an elegant lie and made it look like physics.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d I said, and I followed him because sometimes you step where the floor asks you to and pray your uncle has left enough breadcrumbs inside your bones to get you through the dark.The slit of dark swallowed us the way a drain takes water that has decided not to be a surface anymore. Vetch moved like he owned the angle of the floor and the angle agreed; his cart made a rubber whisper, the kind good machines make to reassure you they will not scream later. My eyes adjusted in stages. The concrete here had been poured with a hand that understood both gravity and art; the aggregate glittered in the beam of the single work light as if the floor had once been a river and still remembered how to hold sunlight in flecks. Pipes ran along the spine of the ceiling, old iron with weld scars that looked like healed mouths, newer composite wrapped in a skin that shivered when you spoke loud, a tangle of copper that someone had braided like hair the day before a wedding. I could taste rust and the ghost of bleach and something else, a fattiness that stuck to the back of the throat the way marrow does when you lick a finger after you\u2019ve pulled bones for soup. It took me three steps to place it. The vents here handled hospital air some days. The city was a body and the lungs had been teaching themselves how to be more than lungs; they had learned how to keep secrets in the alveoli.\n\n\u201cYou redistricted the angels,\u201d I said, because I could see the empty brackets where servo-feet had sat, the scuffed arcs on the concrete from where the wing frames had been dragged. \u201cWe used to run a fan chain down this corridor that would rattle your bones four times a minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did,\u201d Vetch said. He didn\u2019t look over his shoulder. His head had that forward tilt men get when they think they are leading a parade that no one else can see. \u201cThen the Cord decided our feathers were unfashionable. They like ducts that look like the inside of a bank. We still keep a few old wingbones. For sentiment. For leverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeverage is a sentiment now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt always was,\u201d he said, and his grin lived in his voice. \u201cTell me when you feel the cline.\u201d\n\nI did not want to tell him anything because I had a bad habit and did not know how much of me it would cost this time, but my body wanted to be useful. The temperature dipped two degrees at the curve, then snapped up three the length of a breath later, a pressure pocket that made your ears feel like you were remembering a plane ride, a tiny out-gassing of freon kissing my knuckles where they stuck out of the jacket. I put my palm flat to the cinderblock and felt the faint slow pulse of the big system. It was as if the city had a wrist here. \u201cHere,\u201d I said, because the wrist had a vein that sang.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he said. He stopped the dolly with one foot, braced it with a knee, and peeled back the torn corner of a poster that advertised a reunion for a band that had never gotten to the part where you reunite. There was more black behind that. Not a hole. A mouth. Vetch took his inked fingers and pressed three places in sequence the way you soothe a horse when you are about to ask it to behave like a door. \u201cTwice the hard way,\u201d he murmured, which wasn\u2019t to me. The seam unglued itself. Air sighed. My nails in my pocket chimed against one another again and the noise woke up a little bracelet of red lights along the base of the wall, a fox\u2019s eye reflect. \u201cPretty,\u201d Vetch said. \u201cSpread your arms.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, and his grin sharpened.\n\n\u201cYou have hobbies. I have a few. One of them is keeping my lungs inside me when I\u2019m where other people keep their secrets. Arms,\u201d he said, and he held his own out, a show, an invitation, a dare. His wrists were thin, ankles of bird. The ink on his fingers climbed farther than I thought it would; someone had drawn equations there once and the memory of them stained the creases. \u201cLook right, then left. You\u2019ll feel the camera look back. It\u2019s a nervous little thing. It likes coins.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou really trained an alarm on pennies.\u201d I did as he asked because sometimes rebellion is cheap and sometimes it costs you everything, and I had paid enough to stop pretending I didn\u2019t understand this math.\n\n\u201cPennies, bottle caps, pebbles. Things that keep the sound of older economies. We could have built an alarm that calibrates to human cartilage density but then only the people who made it would know how to turn it off when a cat with a bell on its collar ran through. I like cats. I like bells. I don\u2019t like machines that decide to hate me when I have a head cold.\u201d He half-shrugged. The camera\u2019s eye\u2014and it was a camera, but it was also a bead of fluid handling the shape of film memory and light\u2014blinked once. The red went white, then all the lights along the wall softened like butter forgetting it is a square. The mouth opened.\n\nWe stepped into a space that had not been there, except it had always been there and we had just remembered the way your tongue learns to find a tooth with a new crown. It was low enough that you had to bow without making a ritual of it. My shoulder brushed insulation that someone had tucked into fabric; my head bumped a hanger that had once had a bucket and mop hanging from it and now carried something that looked like a bundle of sticks and was not. The more we moved, the more the city\u2019s voice modulated to a pitch I recognized intimately: the song of water neither free nor trapped. Vetch pushed the dolly like he had a date with it later and wanted to leave a good impression. I kept one hand on the wall and let it tell me a story in pulses. We were going down an old service spine, the kind designed by men who wore clip-on ties and thought about the square of nine the way other people think about God. It took two minutes and maybe a lifetime to get to the place where the floor stopped insisting and started begging.\n\nThe bone was named right. It was not white. It was the color of something that had been rubbed by a thousand careful hands, that dull lustre old wood gets when it has been fed oil and sweat, except it was not wood and it was not any kind of bone except in the sense that bones are both structure and a place to store fat when the body has no better pantry. It lay along the floor, half buried in poured concrete like a whale this city had been forced to swallow and had not yet fully digested. Thick cables grew out of it the way hair grows out of auxiliary skin; there were little metal plates on its crown, some new, some stamped with serials from a factory that had burned during the second winter we never call a war. Someone had chalked letters along its length: a math, a prayer, a shopping list. A candle that had been burned down to the stub grinned a perfect wax grin from a bracket; someone had left a hard candy in the dish beside it, a mean little offering, because sugar makes you remember the people who raised you. There were three other people in the room, none of whom stood in the open; their shadows folded themselves as if they had learned origami for survival. One breathed harder than the others. One smelt like tinned fish and mint. The third never once moved; their stillness had a gravity to it that made the hair at my nape sigh.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch it,\u201d Vetch said lightly, which is what you say to a person and a dog and a city when you show them something that you both want and fear at the same time. He set the dolly against the far wall and lifted a tarp that had been pretending to be dirt. Under the tarp, an object lurked that was as obscure as it was obvious: a great drum of old tank metal, the kind they used to store molasses, repurposed and painted with spirals like someone\u2019s grandmother couldn\u2019t help herself. \u201cYou\u2019re going to hate this part. I hated this part the first three times. Then I built a story that made it palatable. You should build one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am told the lock lives in a gut,\u201d I said, and the words went too easily; I had tried to keep them inside my mouth and they had slipped out anyway because my mouth loved telling the truth once it got a taste for it. \u201cI am told the word lives in a mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarun talks,\u201d Vetch said, and finally the friendliness flickered. He flicked his eyes at me and I saw the exact degree to which he would rather not be in a room with the maps he had made until the day they mattered. \u201cYes. It\u2019s gut. It\u2019s mouth. It\u2019s also a bacteria that thought it was a story and a story that thought it was a salt and a salt that learned the shape of grief and laid itself down across a circuit. We invented the word substrate because men like to put something under something else and call it science. This is that, with more rings.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou captured his biome,\u201d I said, choking on the ugliness of it even as my hands twitched curiosity, the way you want to see the cross-section of a engine you hate. \u201cYou sliced him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe volunteered,\u201d Vetch said, perfectly calm and perfectly aware that volunteering is a verb pried out of people by circumstances and goo. \u201cAnd we did not slice him. We nursed his spit, we bribed his bile, we asked the inside of his cheek to tell us where it had slept the night the first lock closed. Then we taught those little animals a song. Then we taught the bone to hum that song back if and only if the mouth that sings it pushes air out in the same pattern that made the lock in the first place. Humans are miraculous. Vents too. Apes as well,\u201d he added, and the drift in his voice said: I am not unaware of who is listening in the walls.\n\n\u201cSing me the song,\u201d I said, and then I had to laugh at myself because that was me trying to be twelve again and ask a man to show me the trick so I could own it, and this was not a trick you own.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t sing,\u201d Vetch said, unhelpfully. He patted the drum. It made a tone like the floor in a cathedral. \u201cBut you\u2019ll taste it.\u201d\n\nThe three shadows separated from their corners the way you peel tape and find it was stuck to itself all along. The one who had smelled like tinned fish offered me a mask. The one with stillness gave Vetch a look that I could not parse and then failed to give me one at all. The third, who breathed like he was always on the lip of a hard run, had hands like mine\u2014calluses in the same geography, one weird scar that mapped to a bolt I recognized on the index finger. He dipped his head to me without pride and I dipped mine back because it felt rude not to say thank you with your neck when people had made a room like this and kept it alive under a city that wanted to forget.\n\n\u201cWe have him,\u201d Vetch said, and because my face went empty the way a screen does when it loses signal and doesn\u2019t want you to know it is afraid, he offered more. \u201cWe had him. We have him again. You can have three iterations of the verb. Language is generous when you are lying to yourself. Harun was taken and we took him back and then we did not entirely leave with him because the Cord has a flair for the dramatic and we have a flair for the practical and sometimes those two flairs meet and mate and produce a ridiculous compromise. He is in a place where he is alive and it makes their ego hurt and our math possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re playing at being oracles,\u201d I said, very flat, because if I let any tone into it I was going to put my fist through the drum and bleed inside out.\n\n\u201cWe are plumbers,\u201d Vetch said. \u201cWith an aesthetics problem. Put the mask on. Then drink. Then breathe when I tell you. Then lean your head in and try not to mind when the bone sneezes.\u201d\n\nIt should have all been theatre. It was theatre. The room was built with care for what a body needs when it is going to do a disgusting, holy thing: there was a steel stool with a pad that had been changed and would be changed again, there was a bucket that was not there to make you feel safe but to be used, there was a tap with water so cold my teeth tried to sing, there was a coil of tubing that had been sterilized and would be sterilized again because someone in this room had lost a child to a stupid needle that had not. I watched the shadows watch me. I sat on the stool. I took the mask because fear needs a prop. I lifted the bottle of water I had brought because I am a good student, then put it down because Vetch gave me a cup that smelled like thyme and iron filings. He had put salt in it, just enough to prep the mouth. He had put sugar too, a slap to the back of the tongue to make the old memory of fig sweet wake up and wag its tail. He watched me swallow as if he could count each muscle\u2019s obedience. He watched me breathe like a medic listens. He nodded once when he believed my air was cooperating. He shifted the tarp again and revealed a pipe fitted to the belly of the bone like a nursing nipple. \u201cYou will not be hurt,\u201d he lied with love. \u201cYou will be changed by the knowledge that you are an animal. That can not be helped.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am an animal,\u201d I said, and I thought of Marshal Ketu\u2019s breath when he said keep him alive, and of my mother\u2019s hands when she set figs on a plate like she was putting little heads in a row to talk to, and of Fenn\u2019s shoulder against mine in the basin. I thought of the young bonobo in his pale jacket telling us a law slow because he knew it would have to carry weight it did not deserve. I put my lips to the pipe and, obedient, as if the floor had asked it, I breathed.\n\nThe bone did not sneeze. It did something worse. It put a thrum in the pipe that matched my pulse and then found the opposite of my pulse like an enemy and sat there, smug and matching. Every time I drew air in, it put out. Every time I tried to let go of air, it sucked, greedily. I was not choking but everything in my head that knows the shape of dying said hello like an old friend with bad intent. The shadows in the room did not move. Vetch\u2019s inked fingers settled on my shoulder bones and did not squeeze. I tasted iron and rain, and under that something like the after of cheap candy, a petroleum ghost that made me want to scrape my tongue on my own teeth. Then\u2014then it happened, the thing I was told would make me hate this less. The taste changed, and it was not taste. It was memory. It did not come from my brain. It came from the place at the back of the mouth where you speak words you have never spoken before and they sound older than your mother.\n\nThere was a street with red stairs. There was a day without cloud. There was a man bending over a boy with a hot bottle and a cool cloth. There was the room where a window had been bricked and then unbricked and the light that came in was the wrong light for that time of day and they all grinned at it anyway like it was a trick done for them by the gods. There was a woman with ink up to the elbow and blood on her knee teaching a machine to listen to a lullaby sung in a language older than the one her mouth had learned to speak after the fourth grade banned the first tongue. There was a hinge on a door. There was a word. The word was not a word. It was a breath turned into wood turned into an instruction set turned into a sound a vent makes when it reverses properly and does not tear the noise out of the lung it loves. I could not tell you what the syllables were because the syllables were not the thing. The ratio was. The ratio put its palm to my chest and said: you are family to those who made me. You are a cousin to the lock. You are a relative by choice and by fault and by the stupid sweetness of the fig your mother taught your mouth to handle when you were four and there was a party and they could not afford cake.\n\nWhen I pulled my mouth away, my hands shook like a bad wire in a not-bad machine. Vetch had a cloth and he wiped my lip because there was a smear there I had not felt happen. He held the cloth up like an exhibit. It had a color on it like no color I have words for because there is a color the inside of a lock makes when it greets the key and that is a thing you should not see if you ever want to sleep again. He smiled at me as if we had been forgiven for breaking a secret. \u201cThere,\u201d he said, and he put the cloth in a bag as lovingly as you put a baby\u2019s tooth in a dish, because this city and this room both loved keeping parts of people in drawers. \u201cYou can come and go. You have the taste. You are the taste. I am sorry,\u201d he added, and he meant it.\n\n\u201cI want to see him,\u201d I said. My voice surrounded the words like putty around a bad window. \u201cNow. If you have him; if you had him; if there is any part of the space between those two statements that can hold my body, take me there.\u201d\n\nVetch did the thing people who think in corners do when a straight line is demanded: he rocked, a little, like his body had ballast and the floor had a wave in it he hadn\u2019t measured for. \u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re moving him again. Or they will. Or they want us to believe they will so we move. You know this dance. You built half the music they\u2019re dancing to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI built vents,\u201d I said. \u201cI built a drain that doesn\u2019t flood the lower stacks when the upper tiers decide to wash their cars in the same hour. I am not a composer of men.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wrote that elegant lie of a spec and I read it,\u201d Vetch said, and the shadow who had held the stillness turned their head just a fraction like a satellite. \u201cYou wrote absolute load numbers you could defend and then carved fifteen percent out of the noise so you would have a panic fund built into the girders when the Chancellor\u2019s budget committee fought you. You wrote a bridge that can flex where they cannot see it flex. Don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know how to build people as systems, Miren. You\u2019re just allergic to calling it that.\u201d He held his hands up when I moved\u2014I did not know whether I had moved to hit him or myself or the bone. \u201cAll right. Compromise. We will let you hear him. You will not go to him. If you go to him now and they take you, they will use you to open us and then we are only meat and sorry thoughts. The hinge was them telling us they know the story. The hinge was your mother\u2019s drawer opening for them. We have to be a new drawer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are very proud of your metaphors,\u201d I said, and the only shape of anger I could find that would not turn me into a knife was contempt made thin. \u201cPut him in my ear.\u201d\n\nVetch did not try to make that pretty. He gestured at the fabric-wrapped insulation I had brushed with my head on the way in, the little bubble of sound that had learned to contain voice instead of heat. He put two fingers to his throat and hummed, and the hummed note traveled up the wall and the wall, obedient, answered with a different note that felt like it happened behind my eyes even though I knew where the speakers were hidden. There was a crackle. There was a breath. There was a coughing laugh. Then there was my uncle, angry and kind, which is to say: himself.\n\n\u201cMiren,\u201d Harun said, and he was holding himself up by sheer invitation. \u201cDo not be a fool.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou first,\u201d I said, and if I had not said that I would have howled like the dog in my bones that had just realized the door was glass. \u201cWhere are you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the place where doors are moral illusions,\u201d he said, and I heard someone else in the near distance chuckle because men like to chuckle when they invent metaphysical jokes in a jail. \u201cI am in between being taken and being held. It is not clever of me. It is not what you would have done. Forgive me. Vetch, stop listening to my niece\u2019s blood move; she is made of it; you will drown.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are on the vent by the grave median,\u201d Vetch said, deadpan, which meant: I care for you, old man, more than I should given that you make my life complicated.\n\n\u201cI am on the vent by the place where the boys used to build kites,\u201d Harun said, which told me the precise corner of the city he meant because that is how the city organizes itself when you are from here; there is the map with names and then there is the map with boys and kites and women with red hair who cried on Tuesdays and the corner where a bicycle was chained for a decade to a pipe and you watched it go from bike to sculpture to ghost. \u201cThe Cord is watching me exactly enough to hurt us later. There is a boy with an ambition the size of the space his father left in his mouth when he knocked his back teeth out. He is making them very brave. They will make a mistake. You will take advantage. The lock will not have to eat anyone today if you can do two things for me, Miren.\u201d\n\n\u201cName them,\u201d I said, because my body was hot all over like fever but the part of me that had fallen in love with specific instructions was cool and grateful and hideous in its gratitude.\n\n\u201cTurn the angels\u2019 shoulders,\u201d he said. \u201cThey moved them. Move them again. The pressure does not care who wears a suit. It cares about angles and the lies you tell when you pretend thirty degrees is close enough to forty-five if you smile at it. You know the corridor where the sky pretends to look down because the glass is angled just so for the cameras. Stand under the sixth rib. Tell it to stop making love to the wind. Tell it to hold its juice. It will not listen to Vetch because it made up its mind about the timbre of his voice when he sang a bad song in a good room. It will listen to you because you talk to metal like it can be forgiven. The second thing is uglier. You will not like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not like the first,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou loved the first,\u201d he said, and he coughed again but the laugh in the cough was a knife used to cut honesty into correct sizes. \u201cThe second is this: tell your mother you did not come to my door when she told you to go. Tell her you chose to leave. She will hurt. She will hate. The city will use her to hurt us if you let it. Make her small for a minute. Save her. I know,\u201d he added, and the wall cannot carry a hand on your hair but he almost managed it, \u201cI am asking you to pick between two kinds of grief. I am sorry. Pick the one that keeps a mouth alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are asking me to be brave in a room where I cannot see the edge,\u201d I said, and the old anger that was also love rose in me like steam. \u201cI hate you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you,\u201d he said, and he meant that sentence in the way a man who is about to do something unforgivable likes to say it. \u201cNow go be an engineer. Vetch, feed her. She gets stupid when the salts go. I will call when the boy with the hole in his teeth makes his mistake, and if they decide not to make it, we will make one for them. Kiss your mother for me if she will let you.\u201d\n\nThe line clicked off. The wall remembered it was insulation. For a moment the bone hummed like a thing that had eaten and was satisfied for half a second. Vetch handed me the cup again and for once did not say anything clever. He watched me swallow and watched my hands find the spanner in my bag and watched me put the nails in my other pocket where I could reach them without thinking. He nodded again at the bone, reverent and practical and a little sick to his stomach because he was a man whether he liked it or not. \u201cYou heard the parade,\u201d he said. \u201cRun ahead of it.\u201d\n\nWe came out of that room faster than we had gone in. The camera liked my nails and told the alarms a little story that kept them occupied. The mouth in the wall sighed shut behind us and pretended to be a poster again. The corridor outside felt warmer because I had a job and living becomes doable when you can put your hand on a knob and make it obey. Vetch did not try to walk with me this time. He tucked his inked hands into his sleeves and gave me a look that men give to women they cannot afford to play hero with: respect that has been stripped of its testosterone. The shadows did not follow us though one of them slid along beside the wall like humidity.\n\n\u201cDo not die for theatre,\u201d he said at the threshold.\n\n\u201cIf I die, make it look like a plumbing accident,\u201d I said. \u201cIt would be funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will make it beautiful,\u201d he said, because he was vain enough to want to be the one to write my epitaph even if he hated half of me for breathing his air. Then he was gone and the city\u2019s broader noise took hold again like a hand on the back of the neck.\n\nThere are places where the city pretends to be empty. There are chairs no one ever sits on under lamps meant for different weather. There is a square where we planted a tree that died every year and we replaced it and finally someone realized the sum of those deaths was a better ritual than a living tree would have been. The sixth rib of the atrium\u2019s east flank was not in a place anyone but us looked at; it sat above the seam where the market\u2019s billboards stopped arguing with each other and in that lull the engineering had gotten away with a fix that made a sound you would only hear if you had learned to love the noises machines produce when they are telling you their truth. I took the stairs two at a time and then realized I was not twenty anymore and my thighs made an unpleasant argument the whole way up. The teams on duty did not look at me when I passed because you can pretend you don\u2019t know something if you don\u2019t look it in the face. The camera at the threshold winked at my nails as if we were old friends. The sixth rib lay where it had always lay, smug because it belonged to a shape people loved and would not allow to be ugly.\n\nIt is hard to explain to a person who has never had to talk to a joint how it is like convincing a mule to cross a stream. There is no argument. There is the weight of your body placed correctly and the pressure of your palm behaving like a promise. There is the way you let your breath out at the exact moment the hinge decides it could be persuaded by love instead of force. There is a murder you do not commit because you have remembered to move before killing becomes the only language a machine will hear. I put my hand on the rib and I apologized for what men in suits had done to its shoulders, and then I whispered to the angels and asked them if they would mind folding a little different tonight because there were children under here who would appreciate a dry bed. The rib did not have ears but it had temperature and pressure and an achy place that had been down-hinged too far for too long. I found the bolt that hid under the gasket. I turned it a quarter. I listened, right cheek to metal. The world shifted like a great animal reconfiguring its sleep in the straw and deciding on a different side. Far below, a vent coughed and then pulled a breath in with a will. The whine that had haunted the west gutter closed like a mouth that had been forced to open too wide. I could feel in my teeth the gate at the grave median test itself and then tolerate its own correctness. Good. One thing. A screw you could turn. The kind of victory my mother hated because it made me high.\n\nBelow me the market was doing its night dance. Women in coats like vertical fields walked under light. A baby howled once and then forgot what anger was for thirty seconds. An ape in a jacket with sleeves so tight his shoulders made a joke of fashion touched the top of a kiosk and let his fingers linger on the glass the way a man who did not touch often might touch a surface just to remind his body what skin was. Marshal Ketu\u2019s shadow passed over the far mezzanine and I knew him even in silhouette because scars make a posture you carry even when you try not to. He did not look up. He had told me to keep my uncle alive as long as I could and then to be meat for a machine if I could not. I had done the first thing he asked without breaking. I had already put my mouth on the road to the second.\n\nMy phone hummed against the bone of my thigh like a small domesticated animal eager to show me the trouble it had found. It was not a number I knew and it was the number I had been waiting for like a bad student waits for a grade. The word was not a word. It was a clatter of punctuation that meant: now. The map bloomed in the air and then I made it not bloom because the city has eyes and I have learned to be a person two steps away from being under glass. I tucked the phone into my pocket. I was about to step down when the world changed gears, the way a good bicycle does when you find the right hill to make it behave. Something in the east shook and stopped pretending to be obedient. Alarms began in the far distance and then nearer. The Cord loved a siren the way children love sour candy. The sirens did not sound like appetite. They sounded like humiliation sharpened into duty. The boy with the hole where the teeth should be had done his brave thing. It was time to answer.\n\nI ran the quick way through the back of the market, under the awnings where someone had spent real money to make the rain sound nice and then complained when it did what rain does and made everything inconvenient. The map took me not to a vent, not to a door that remembered me, but to a piece of sculpture a student had welded out of regret and bicycle rims during the second year of the Chancellor\u2019s rule because we had all thought making art in public was a safer way to rebel than making bombs, and nobody had told the student that both weapons required a similar appetite for shame. The sculpture had been meant to look like a fish or a hand or a promise; it looked like a failure that would cut you if you got too close. I got close. The nails chimed. The base had a panel that someone had installed with more force than love. I pried it. There was a space behind it that could hold a human and a human\u2019s poor decisions. I had both. I crawled in, counted the burrs as they caught my jacket and then released me like someone had been nice enough to clip them down the day before. I hit my knee on something important and my knee screamed and then said sorry because it knew I was doing my best. Then I was in a pipe next to a pipe next to a shaft that said: if you fall, this will be the last teaching this city offers you.\n\nVoices moved along the shaft, a dozen floors away and one breath to my left. The map wanted me to move fast. My body wanted me to be quiet. I did both, a ridiculous compromise, because people are dumb angels when we think speed will save us from math. I took a left where the smell of old coffee said left, a right where a patch of damp said the janitors had stopped caring the day the pay changed, a third right because the pipe bent that way and pipes are conservative and it is good to be polite to conservatives when you need them. There was a bar of light ahead that meant a grate. I wanted to reach it and huddle under it like a rat. I wanted to avoid it because light is a narcotic and the Cord projects their authority in shadow. I belly-crawled and swore at the past version of me who had put on a belt this morning like a functional adult. I stopped with my nose a centimeter from the grate and let my eyes go up out of my head like a periscope.\n\nWe were at the edge of the grave median. The place where the boys used to fly kites lay empty not because no one loved it but because it was the kind of emptiness you pay to maintain. There were flags along the low wall that had always been tasteful because someone had decided human mourning needed a graphic designer. Under the sixth rib\u2019s shadow\u2014my rib, mine for the minute because I had told it to behave and it had listened\u2014the Cord had set up a false tent, the kind of canvas that pretends it is cotton because it wants to smell like sincerity but has a spine of carbon that can hold a conversation with bullets. The tent had a table. The table had a man. The man had a face I knew and eyes that pretended I did not exist. He had been my uncle and he was again and would be again if the city's math was kind. He looked tired in the way men get tired when they have been arguing with a wall that thinks it is a priest. A gorilla in a suit with epaulets he had not earned yet stood three steps to Harun\u2019s left and did not blink when he did. His lip had a scar I knew. There it was, the boy in the wrong uniform, wearing a face that had been taught how to hold grief like a baton.\n\nMarshal Ketu stood to the right of the tent, away from the boy, away from Harun, as if distancing himself would make the decision he had already made cleaner. He looked not at my uncle and not at the boy and not at the wall that faced the kites. He looked at the rib. He looked at the lighting. He was doing the work good soldiers do when they know the order is not theirs and will leave a stain. His jaw worked once like he had cracked a nut and then decided to swallow shell and meat together to save time.\n\nThe boy with the epaulets was talking low, a voice you could drink and not taste because it had been trained to be palatable. \u201c\u2026not here to hurt you,\u201d he was saying, which is a sentence men say when they have already enjoyed the idea of what hurting you would feel like. \u201cWe want to understand the logic of the thing. It would be so much easier if you\u2019d simply give us the words. It is child\u2019s play to reverse a vent, Harun. Why make it witchcraft.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not witchcraft,\u201d Harun said, and I could hear his mouth snarl into a smile because he was cruel when he needed to be to survive a man like this. \u201cIt is cookery. It is sugar whipped to soft, then stiff peaks. It is soup salted enough to make your grandmother cry.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoetry,\u201d the boy said, bored and old at once, which is a trick taught in certain rooms that I had never forgiven for existing.\n\n\u201cMath,\u201d Harun said. \u201cPoetry is what men like you build guillotines out of when the math tells you your neck is available.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are afraid of guillotines,\u201d the boy said, and here it was, the hole where the tooth would go someday when he stole the right person\u2019s mouth and used it. \u201cWe have kinder machines now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am afraid of idiots,\u201d Harun said. \u201cAnd of boys too brave to listen.\u201d He looked not at the rib, not at the tent, not at the boy. He looked at the lamplight\u2019s edge where darkness cushioned itself against concrete. He did not look at me and he looked at me. He said, in the tone of a man discussing a weather vane with a farmer, \u201cIt\u2019s going to rain in ninety seconds. Put your hat on.\u201d\n\nThe boy glanced up because men like that do not like being told a thing they did not know and immediately need to show they did know it. Ketu moved his head that sliver again, his cat\u2019s tilt. I shut my eyes and put my hand against the pipe and told the vent to pretend to be thunder. The angels shouldered. The air reversed and then un-reversed under the sixth rib because I had not asked enough and now I had a chance to ask again in a language I knew. I counted. The pressure pocket I had left behind woke, stretched, yawned. The bone far under us hummed once, low and patient. Someone up-tier flushed their very expensive toilet and it made a sound that would have humiliated them if they had been able to hear themselves the way the city hears us. The boy turned his head fully and then this happened, this ridiculous thing that only happens when you have lived long enough to see good math. The apes at the other two corners of the false tent\u2014the ones pretending to hold up poles that did not need holding\u2014shifted their weight together. Their balance changed. Their tendons telegraphed to each other the way the apes had learned to telegraph in the forest a long time ago when a leopard looked at them with dinner in its eyes. In that breath, Vetch\u2019s shadows did whatever men like Vetch are for when the sentimental work is done.\n\nIt was ugly and fluid and small and it was over before it had gotten good. The tent\u2019s canvas folded at the wrong time and became a veil. The table tipped itself and became a ramp. Something under the ramp popped, a pop like a toy gun in a child\u2019s hand in an old movie. Ketu looked bored and then he looked annoyed and then he looked like a man who had made a phone call an hour ago that he was glad someone answered. The boy\u2019s epaulets were not where he thought they would be. Harun stood up as if someone had let him. He moved into the space that opened up because the world likes a good stage direction. He did not run. He did not fight. He took two steps like a man going to a faucet to try the water. The ape to Ketu\u2019s left made a decision and put his hand out. His hand touched air where a shoulder had been. The world rearranged around that miss and kept going.\n\nI pushed the grate. It did not give because it had been put there by a janitor in a bad mood with better tools than mine. The nails in my pocket chimed like a warning. The boy with the epaulets said something I will not repeat because some words are like lime on a corpse; they do a job but they burn the living. Ketu did the thing I had not expected him to do, which is to say: he stepped into the boy\u2019s sentence and let his body make a wall that would be punished later in a way he had already accounted for. He looked down into the shaft and he did not smile but the distance between the two corners of his mouth altered, and I saw there a human being and I forgave him for what he had not yet done and might not do. The grate unpinned, heavy with old gum and a decade of skin flakes. I let it ride my shoes. I breathed. I breathed like a person who had put her mouth on a bone and learned a terrible song.\n\nHarun fell, exactly the way your uncle falls when he has been criticizing the ceiling for too long and finally the ceiling gets offended. He did not scream because he is vain. He tucked his shoulder and made a friend of gravity. He hit the lip above me and turned that impact into a pivot with a grace that made me almost laugh because he had never been any good at dancing when my mother made him do it and here he was moving well because he thought his life depended on it. I put my hands up without thinking and I caught part of him and then the rest of him caught itself, and then he was on my face and my face was full of my uncle and my arms were telling my back they intended to be unhappy with me about this tomorrow. I did not say his name because the pipe is an excellent gossip. He did not say mine because he is not a fool twice in one minute.\n\nAbove us the tent became a reason for three apes to lose their jobs in quiet, and the boy with the epaulets learned how to make a promise to himself that would get him through tomorrow\u2019s disappointment. Ketu stayed where he was and did not look down, which is a way to look down in this city that does not leave evidence. I pulled my uncle into the pipe the way a person pulls a very large cat out of the way of a bicycle. He breathed wrong and then right. He smelled like somebody else\u2019s soap and his own sweat and a little like figs because the city is rude and it loves a metaphor. \u201cHello,\u201d he said into my ear because there was no room for hello to land anywhere else. \u201cWe should go.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should,\u201d I said, and I reached behind me, fingers finding the burrs, the old glue, the places the janitors had cursed in three languages over a decade ago. \u201cI hate you.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will need that. It is an excellent fuel.\u201d\n\nWe did not take the way I had come because the city had already mapped it for us and sent men whose feet made no sound to stand at the end of it. We took the way that required a person to know where the pipes sigh in winter and which bends are generous and which are mean. We took the way where the student\u2019s sculpture bled me on the forehead and made me sneeze and the sneeze echoed like a tiny heresy. We took the way where Vetch\u2019s shadow became weight and then absence again like a hand you do not see pulling back a curtain. We took the way that brought us under the first city my mother had told me about, the city you can only smell because nothing of it exists anymore but the scent of a stew made on a frightened night.\n\nBy the time the bone\u2019s room yawned at us again, I had two knees that would not write home to their mothers, a bruise down my spine that would make Fenn swear creative new swears, and a man under my arm who had just refused to give a boy the words that would kill a city because he had promised me a stew and a joke and a mercy. Vetch did not clap. He did not even lift his hands. He looked at Harun like he was a hinge that had done its job and then taken it too far by also deciding to be pretty. The shadow who had smelled like tinned fish sucked their teeth in satisfaction and then stopped because satisfaction is dangerous. The still one looked at us and, for the first time, blinked in such a way that I knew they were not a machine. Somebody put a cup in my hand and then took it away because I wasn\u2019t ready to hold anything. Somebody said \u201csalt,\u201d and somebody else said \u201cno,\u201d and then I was sitting and Harun was sitting and we were a ruin and a joke and a promise and a mouth.\n\n\u201cI heard you kiss the bone,\u201d he said, wheezing a little because he had fallen twice today\u2014the long way and the short. \u201cHow did you like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt tasted like you bragging,\u201d I said, and then I laughed because the laugh needed out and if it didn\u2019t get out it was going to sit in my bones and make bad weather.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he said. He put his hand on my knee because his hand needed a rest more than my knee needed comfort. He looked at Vetch. He looked at the room. He looked at the bone, his old friend, the way men look at an animal they have broken and loved and asked small favors of for a long span of small hours. \u201cYou have to move again,\u201d he said. \u201cHe will come hunting tomorrow with a clean shirt on and a better metaphor and a camera.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are already ghosts,\u201d Vetch said. His voice sounded like a man who has learned to hate the word elegant when men in uniforms use it. \u201cWe\u2019ll show him his reflection. Then we\u2019ll lead him to the water.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t drown the boy,\u201d Harun said. \u201cDrown his future.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that a request or a blessing,\u201d Vetch asked, sweetly murderous.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Harun said. Then he turned to me and let his mouth be soft in a way he would not allow it to be in public because he had watched me be born and had never forgiven me for the way my first cry had made his heart behave like an organ. \u201cWe have a day,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe two. The keystone moves. The Chancellor pretends not to sign the paper because he is courteous enough not to wipe his hands in public. Your tender sits on a desk where the boy will attempt to use it as a lever. You will go home. You will eat. You will sleep in a way that fools your enemy into believing you are not awake. In the morning you will take your wrench to a place no news camera knows how to film and you will change a shape that has been waiting thirty years to be changed the way a jaw waits to be set right. Can you do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can fix,\u201d I said, because I was too tired to be grand. \u201cIt is my one trick.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is every trick,\u201d he said, and he patted the bone as if it were a dog that had chewed a shoe and he was pretending to be angry to teach it patience. \u201cWhat we break on purpose we must be able to break again. That is the covenant.\u201d He hauled himself up, slower than he had fallen, and he swore in a language that had salt dried into its vowels. \u201cAnd Miren. Do not tell your mother I fell out of a tent.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe saw you do worse,\u201d I said, because cruelty is kin to love in this family. \u201cTell me now the word. Whisper it to me like a bedtime story. Tell me not so that I can use it. Tell me so that I can not use it. Tell me so that if the city asks me to eat grief, my mouth will open on purpose.\u201d\n\nHe held my face in his hands and I let him because I am stupid and because love makes bodies surrender to hands they should not. He smiled like the first day he took me to the reservoir and pretended to be the kind of grown-up who knows how to amuse a child without bribery. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, with such mercy that I hated him again. \u201cYou will hear it when you need it. If I put it in your mouth now, you will rehearse. If you rehearse, you will spill. And if you spill, my love, the city drowns on the wrong day.\u201d\n\nI closed my eyes and breathed. The bone hummed. The shadows remembered how to fold. Vetch checked his ink as if there were instructions there he could read without light. Somewhere, up-top, a choir sang the old human song about morning on the river to a room full of men with soft eyes and cameras, and they sang it precisely enough that you could tell they were being watched. I opened my eyes. I stood up. I picked up my wrench. I chose one grief over another as if it were a bolt and not a throat. Then I went to do the job that had my name on it and held, a palm on a surface that needed a hand, the way real power touches the world when it is tired and wants to go home and cannot.Morning came in like a waiter with a tray he couldn\u2019t balance, polite and trembling and already apologizing for what he was about to spill. I slept enough to convince my cells to keep cooperating with my bones, and no more. In the half-dream before the clock\u2019s mouth opened, I chewed a fig that tasted like metal filings and my mother\u2019s handwriting, and I pressed my ear to a door hinge that had learned a lullaby and was humming under its breath. When the chime finally made a little stone skip across the surface of my brain, I got up, rinsed the taste of bone from my mouth with water that pretended to be clean, and put my tools in their slots like a litany because there are mornings that require you to prove you believe in order.\n\nFenn was already at the yard when I got there, sitting astride a crate of sleeves like a queen on an ugly throne. She had that look she gets when she knows before I say anything that the day is going to demand muscles we don\u2019t have and we will make them on the spot. She flicked a pebble at my boot, as if to test whether I\u2019d noted the map\u2019s stupid advice and furnished myself with small stones. The pebble glanced off my toe cap and made a good little sound. She raised her eyebrows as if to say: I approve of your jewelry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a ghosted intake on the north sub-plenum,\u201d she said, which was the city\u2019s version of gossip: a bunch of words about air. \u201cNumbers show somebody edited the curve to please a graph. It\u2019s going to tear itself a new throat before dinner if we let it pretend it is a throat.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo cameras?\u201d I asked, and she snorted because I had just insulted her competence.\n\n\u201cThey tried,\u201d she said, and she bit her lower lip as if it were a wire she needed to strip. \u201cThey put one of those little sugar beads in a bracket so it looks like grease that got ideas. I popped it and it squealed like a piglet for a second and then remembered it was a bead again. Vetch sent a brat to tell me not to eat breakfast first. I ate anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe thinks he\u2019s looking after us,\u201d I said, because it was easier to be unkind to the kind than to name the thing under the thing. \u201cLet\u2019s move.\u201d\n\nWe took the cart because I didn\u2019t feel like teaching my knees any new lessons. The sub-plenum under the north aqueduct was the kind of place cities only let you see if you are either a maintenance worker or a ghost. It was a scar from the old build, a long concrete scar with bad lighting and perfect acoustics for the one song nobody wants to hear, the one that goes: if this fails, people drown and you caused it by believing in bolts. The door pretended to be a blank spot on a blank wall. Fenn hummed three notes and rolled her shoulder into it and the door sighed because it remembered her and opened before it could decide to be coy. Inside the air had a salt edge to it that meant the aqueduct was in a mood and we had brought our moods to match it.\n\nThe intake sat like a sleeping animal that knows it is on the wrong bedding. You could see where somebody\u2014not one of us; one of them\u2014had fiddled the angle on the guide vanes to take a vibration out of a signature during a demonstration, the way you drape a scarf over a bruise and call it fashion. The soprano whine I hated was right there on the edge of hearing, except for the cameras it had been pushed down just far enough to hide under applause. A little bead on the third strut winked and then didn\u2019t. I put my palm on the casing and let the numb hum run up my arm into the old place behind my ear where I keep the city\u2019s noise like a pet. The pressure didn\u2019t like itself. The pressure wanted a different spine.\n\n\u201cDo you want compassionate or do you want quick,\u201d Fenn asked, and I smiled because that is our version of asking whether you want to pull a tooth or the whole jaw.\n\n\u201cCompassionate,\u201d I said, because men with epaulets always choose quick and I like to be contrary when the world\u2019s arithmetic is wrong. \u201cAnd then quick.\u201d\n\nWe walked the circumferential, small step after small step, poverty\u2019s patience. I saw where the bead had chewed a little line into the paint until the primer showed through, a white smile that meant: I am collecting you, keep moving. I slid my nails along the bracket until the little eye saw the glint and fell for it. It clicked. Fenn\u2019s fingers were waiting with a bit of chewing gum and a shred of foil like magic; she palmed the bead and smothered it without waking the alarm behind it because there are gods of small kindnesses even in rooms with tools. We stuck the bead to the underside of an old clipboard and pointed it at a wall where it could listen to concrete breathe and report a shift in politics to a man who hadn\u2019t earned his epaulets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s flattering,\u201d Fenn said, and she rubbed her thumb and forefinger together to rid herself of the gum memory. \u201cThey think we are interesting enough to spy on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey think their reflection is the world,\u201d I said. \u201cIf they could film vacuum, they\u2019d put a title on it and sell ad space.\u201d\n\nWe loosened the man-handled vanes, bolt by bolt. I hummed the ratio under my tongue because I couldn\u2019t help it now that it had taken up residence and put its little plants in my body. It didn\u2019t matter here; the bone\u2019s song was not for metal, not like that, but it helped my breath in the way counting helps you pretend you are rational during a fall. The vane that had been torqued past its happy angle let go with a sigh that felt like somebody taking a bad bandage off. Fenn held the vane like you hold a drunk friend learning to walk sober again. We got the pitch where the math said and where the noise agreed, and when we tightened the last collar the intake did that good thing I love, the almost smile a machine makes when you have let it be what it knows how to be.\n\n\u201cYou made it pretty,\u201d Fenn said, which was her way of praising a fix she couldn\u2019t afford to love.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell,\u201d I said, and I reached up and pressed my cheek for a second against the case because I am a sentimental idiot who thinks steel likes being thanked. \u201cIt will get arrogant.\u201d\n\nWe logged a false number in the board because we have learned to feed the spreadsheet its favorite lies. We tucked the bead-lie in its new little corner and gave it a shadow show to report to its gods. When we came out, the day had gotten the idea into its head that it would be bright. We let it. We walked along the aqueduct spine to the stair where the white moss grows because nobody wants to scrub in the back corners, and Fenn sucked air between her teeth the way she does when she is about to put a finger on the sentence I have kept folded for later.\n\n\u201cYou stink of a man,\u201d she said, and she did not make it a judgment, she made it physiology. \u201cSoap I don\u2019t buy and a tired that has somebody else\u2019s name on it. Do we need to buy a shovel.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, because I had not had time to construct a better lie and the truth was a poor thing that looked worse in daylight. \u201cWe have a day. Maybe two.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou keep making time like bread,\u201d she said, and her mouth went crooked in a fondness that is a knife and a pillow both. \u201cWhat do you need me to do that doesn\u2019t sound like a story until we say it fast.\u201d\n\n\u201cStay close,\u201d I said. \u201cHold tools. Ask me three times whether I\u2019ve eaten. Tell me what I am not thinking of because my head is a highway with too many cars on it. And if someone in black says he wants to understand the logic of the thing, hit him with a wrench and run.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my favorite instruction set,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere do we go be brave next.\u201d\n\n\u201cUp,\u201d I said, because gravity is a suggestion when you are stupid enough to love a city. \u201cWe have to set a jaw.\u201d\n\nThe keystone skeleton rose out of the middle tiers like somebody had dropped a rib cage sideways and asked it to breathe. It was not a single thing. No keystone is, no matter what the speeches try to sell you. It was ducts and throats and little placebos of copper that told big pipes to calm down; it was a pretty glass mask they were building to put over the ugly machine so the cameras could say: look, governance. The tender had gone out in four packets. Our unit had thrown ours up against the wall and watched the equipage we don\u2019t own bounce off and fall into a different yard. A firm with uniforms and a logo that makes people nod had their workers in vests strutting like roosters on the scaffolds, pointing at each other with chalk and pretending the world was a chalkboard. The Cord had installed itself politely at the perimeter, which meant they intended to pretend no one noticed their weapons. The boy with the wrong epaulets was not there. Marshal Ketu was, in a position that would allow him to see angles and pretend he was watching doors.\n\nWe did not go in through the polite way. We snuck in the way maintenance does when the polite way asks you to show your tongue for bites. The third service stair behind the advertisement for oranges took us to a catwalk nobody had measured for the weight of two humans and a bag of sleeves. The mesh trembled a little, unhappy in its old age. Below, a union man yelled at a tech with a ponytail and called the metal by the wrong name. People love to be authoritative about nouns. I put my hand on the bracket that held the case for the east throat and felt its silly little shiver. Somebody had told it to flex to please an algorithm. Somebody had not thought about the day after tomorrow when the algorithm would no longer be watching.\n\nFenn held the bag open and I reached in without looking like I have since we were twenty and both drunk on the cussed joy of finding exactly the right wrench by memory. She felt for my shoulder with her knee to steady me the way she always does. I slid the shim into its mean little place because no camera in the world knows how to film the exact moment a wedge reminds a noisy machine that silence is possible and necessary. The case settled. The vibration that would have announced itself like a bad habit during the demo disappeared the way you only get to watch a sin vanish when you have caught it early and smacked it the correct way. You can fool a governor and you can fool a crowd; you cannot fool metal when it is in a certain mood. We fiddled the second and third and left the fourth alone because the fourth had learned how to pray and I respect devotion in equipment.\n\nKetu\u2019s eyes found us without moving from where they were pretending to study a joint. He did not nod. He did not give himself away to the ceiling. His throatboard flickered once like a fish and then kept still. I looked where he wanted me to look without looking like I was looking, which is an unfortunate skill I inherited with my mother\u2019s vocabulary. The boy with the epaulets had not come in person, but he had sent a proxy: a young mandrill with beautifully braided whiskers and a tablet, fierce in the way you are fierce when you are trying to be the right kind of tool for a bad hand. He stood near the demonstration gallery and pointed at a model of the keystone they had made for show, a thing that would never carry water and was therefore eager to be obedient. The mandrill had a translator clipped to his pocket that turned his voice into syrup. The syrup said words like efficiently and public-private. The crowd of vests listened with the careful excitement people curate when they know a camera sits somewhere behind their left shoulder.\n\n\u201cYou fixed the jaw before he touched it,\u201d Fenn murmured, and she knew because the case under us had stopped trying to complicate my heartbeat.\n\n\u201cI gave it dignity,\u201d I said, because that is a better word in the city than mercy and it offends fewer gods. \u201cHe\u2019ll try it anyway. He\u2019ll say it was always supposed to do this.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Fenn asked without smiling, \u201cdoes your friend with the scar on his lip protect your skinny neck from the epaulets who think about words like efficiently in their sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, because I had promised myself not to lie when I asked for her to be near me. \u201cHe protects the city. If we benefit, it is because the city likes us this week.\u201d\n\nThe demo started because someone said it had started. A man in a clean jacket with a logo lifted his hands, and the throat sang the note it sings when it is about to reverse and make a crowd clap because they love magic even when it is physics. For a second, for the span of an unkind phrase, I thought we had failed because the throat stuttered. Then the shim did its quiet job and the note slid into its correct pitch, and the reversal moved the river in a way that would have made a grandmother nod instead of spit. The mandrill beamed like he had invented air, and the vests clapped as if they were not clapping for the wedge in my pocket and the callus on the web of my thumb. Ketu\u2019s chin moved a degree, which in his body is a laugh and a prayer. I realized I was sweating in a place on my back that is ridiculous. I breathed out. Fenn exhaled the way she does after a long line of tiny welds, a whisper it would be a pity to waste on talking.\n\nThey paraded the keystone\u2019s virtues. Somebody said resilience and meant: this piece of glamour will let us do uglier things with less guilt. A woman with a braid that didn\u2019t move even when she lied talked about communities and smiled on all four quadrants of her mouth. I thought about Harun in the pipe telling me to turn the angels\u2019 shoulders and kiss my mother for him, and I felt again the ratio twitch under my tongue like it was ashamed of being called a word. The boy with the epaulets would watch this later in a room that smelled like disinfectant and good coffee. He would point at a place on the screen where water pretended to be a ribbon and ask whether the ribbon could be cut. I had just made it harder for him to get his scissors to the right edge. It was insufficient. It was still the right thing to do on a Thursday morning.\n\nWe were almost out of the skeleton when the phone in my pocket made that soft bowel-movement sound it makes when my mother texts me, because my mother cannot tell a machine how not to be embarrassing. The text said one word: beans. It meant: are you alive. It meant: I am and I don\u2019t know what to do with it. It meant: come and let me stand in the doorway and hurt you with my love until it becomes tolerable and then have seconds. I typed back the lie Harun had asked me to build with my mouth. I told her I couldn\u2019t come because I had chosen a piece of work over her and I would make it up to her later. I told her not to save me anything because I did not deserve it. I told her anyway that I loved her, because we use that sentence prophylactically in my family and sometimes it does its job and sometimes it does not. The dots blinked. Then the dots stopped. Then she sent a heart, not the one the kids use, the old ugly one that looks like a butt, because she is contrary on purpose when language makes a fashion.\n\n\u201cThere it is,\u201d Fenn said, when she saw my face do the grab-myself thing. \u201cThe day\u2019s most expensive bolt.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate him for being right,\u201d I said, and she put her hand on the back of my neck and let me lean my head for a second on the place between her thumb and forefinger where muscle meets grace.\n\nBy afternoon, the city\u2019s gossip had adjusted its pitch. The intake we\u2019d coaxed into dignity held its line. The boys with cameras went to film a different part of the skeleton, a curl of pipe that looked good in a certain light. The Cord redistributed itself like bread soaked in soup. I had three messages from numbers I didn\u2019t know that asked me to sign things and three from numbers I do know that asked me to look at a leak that had been a leak since the year my father stopped singing. The one that mattered was a string of punctuation from Vetch that meant: down. I ate a packet of almonds as if it were a petition. I stood at a sink and washed the public off my hands. Then I went back to the place no camera knows how to film because it is too sincere to look interesting.\n\nThe bone room had been cleaned. You could only see it if you knew the corners. The cup I had put my mouth on had been replaced with a brother-cup. The shadow who smelled like tinned fish sat cross-legged on the floor, sewing a tear in a canvas roll quietly, using their teeth to pull the thread tight when the knot argued. Vetch had ink on one ear as if he had fallen asleep on an equation and gotten branded. Harun was not here. That was good. That was bad. Vetch saw me and, without fuss, handed me a rice ball a woman I did not know had made with her anger and her salt. It tasted like mercy pretending to be carbohydrates.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re nervous,\u201d he said around whatever he had in his own cheek. \u201cThe boy made a speech to a room of men with more money than taste and told them reverse is the new forward. They clapped. He thinks clapping is a floor you can build on. The Chancellor pretended not to hear him. Ketu sent me a picture of a pigeon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to do with a pigeon,\u201d I asked, but I already knew. \u201cCount the streetlights in the background. Name the chunk in the cornice.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee,\u201d Vetch said, and he put a hand on his heart and bowed as if I were the lesson. \u201cHe is under the Old Post, where they cut the walls thin to save mortar in a year nobody remembers correctly. There\u2019s a crawlspace there that connects to the old bank we turned into a theater for three weeks and then turned back into a bank because the owner cried. They\u2019ll walk him past midnight so the boy can feel like a prince of shadows. We\u2019ll give him a different shadow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to fix a thing before then,\u201d I said, because my body likes to be told the next list item so it doesn\u2019t sit down and refuse. \u201cHe wants the valve chain by the Old Post to act like a flock. He wants them to turn when he whistles.\u201d\n\nVetch made the face he makes when he would prefer onions to exist in a soup of his he has been told should not have onions. \u201cWe gave the flock a shepherd after Red Stairs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe told it the whistle is a dog. It still wants to be a good bird. If he brings a signal that smells like God, it will listen.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have God,\u201d I said, because faith is useful when you use it against people who think they can buy it. \u201cHe has a boy\u2019s mouth and a good camera. If I make the flock go deaf in one ear and pretend not to hear when he blows, can you make him believe his instrument is broken.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can make a man believe he is his instrument,\u201d Vetch said, a little wicked, because he always wanted to be a larger force than he is in a city that does not reward him for existing. \u201cGo. The Old Post\u2019s lungs know you now. They\u2019ll stop coughing when you touch them.\u201d\n\nI took the back ways because after the morning I didn\u2019t have the stomach for anyone\u2019s uniform. The Old Post had a skin like a patient who has given blood for years and now can\u2019t find a vein. The marble steps pretended marble is immortal. The columns pretended they held something more than an idea about power. I slid under a guard rail that had been painted a municipal green so depressing you could taste it if you said the color out loud. The wall had the kind of smudge that looks like four decades and is actually last Tuesday\u2019s cigarette. I pressed the smudge where it had learned to be a hinge. It opened like a mouth that has decided to believe in you for a minute because believing in you is less boring than not believing in you is.\n\nInside, the flock lived stacked in two tiers: old valve wheels big as saints\u2019 halos and newer controls that blinked their small stupid lights to comfort a manager somewhere up-tier who will someday claim to have been on our side. The chain talked to itself in little clacks and squeals because metal likes a gossip and it always has. The west ear was fine. The east ear had been tuned for theatre. You could see the brightness where a Cord engineer\u2014someone like me except their mother probably loves them safely and their soul may or may not be a thing you could locate in a room\u2014had walked in with good intentions and made a beautiful wrong. I put my hands on two places and I spoke to the flock with my wrists. Fenn would say I was flirting with the city again. The chain pretended to resist because machines enjoy being courted. It wanted a different anchor. I gave it two, a ridiculous redundancy, because I am paranoid and the world has earned it. I pulled the east ear a degree into its sulk and then back just shy of where it wanted to settle to force the spring to hold muscle. The whine the Old Post had used to clear pigeons from the eaves in the winter of the old regime woke for a second. I kissed my teeth at it. It minded. It shut up.\n\nWhile I was hunched there with my head in a nest of steel, a pair of polished shoes came to a stop six feet behind my spine and decided not to kick me. Shoes like that rarely learn restraint, so I looked because I am not a fan of unpleasant surprises with good posture. Marshal Ketu\u2019s trousers were creased like a man who has learned how to sit without being comfortable. His suit had been cut to flatter a shoulder that did not require flattery. He had no epaulets. He didn\u2019t need them. They would have been redundant on that mountain of opinion. His mouth did not know whether it had a smile in it and it did not ask his eyes for permission to try.\n\n\u201cYou smiled at the throat,\u201d he said, as if this city were a gossip and it had told him something as private as a woman\u2019s sigh.\n\n\u201cI smiled at the backsplash,\u201d I said, because I am vain about the angles I save, not the ones I show. \u201cAnd at the part where physics pretended to be magic and nobody bled.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a talent for making complicated things obey you for a minute,\u201d he said, and he glanced at the biggest valve the way you look at a stubborn mule. \u201cI do not know if that is a gift or a red flag. In my world, those two things are flirting.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour world should be more honest with itself,\u201d I said, and I stood up slowly, letting my knees tell him how they felt about all this. \u201cYou\u2019re walking him past midnight.\u201d\n\nHis irises did a thing lenses do when they catch more light than they asked for and decide to be gracious about it. \u201cYou have terrible sources,\u201d he said, which meant: your source is exactly right and if I say it out loud I have to tell my supervisors I am still a human being.\n\n\u201cThe boy with the epaulets likes the taste of theatre,\u201d I said, and I let my wrench hit my palm, metal on meat, a metronome I have learned to use on certain men. \u201cHe thinks the city is a room that belongs to him if he knows the passwords. He doesn\u2019t know you text birds.\u201d\n\n\u201cI texted a pigeon,\u201d he said, and his scar did the closest thing it can do to relax. \u201cIt was an artful pigeon.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes he know you\u2019re not going to let him drown your job to prove a point,\u201d I asked, and Ketu looked at the east ear like it had said something unkind about his mother.\n\n\u201cHe thinks I am hungry for promotion and praise,\u201d Ketu said. \u201cHe is not wrong. I am a vain creature. He is wrong about the currency in which I accept payment.\u201d He extended his hand the way men do when they are about to say something you could use to hang them with if you were that kind of person. \u201cIf you have to choose between the lock and your uncle, follow the math. Do I need to tell you what the answer is.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, because he had seen me with my mouth on the bone in his way without seeing me at all. \u201cYou are not the one who gets to make me say it.\u201d\n\nHe inclined his head and did that soldier thing where he steps away from a fact without actually moving. \u201cTonight he will be tempted to draw his gun and point it at the part of your uncle that makes him a good story. No one will fire. I am telling you this so you can keep your hands steady. If you shake on a wrench, the city notices.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he points his gun at my uncle\u2019s mouth, I will break his hand with your permission and without it,\u201d I said, because if you do not say the monstrous thing when it is necessary the monstrous thing will use you later for a spoon.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Ketu said simply, and I believed he meant it and that scared me more than if he had made a speech about order. \u201cEat something. People who faint in tunnels are a damned nuisance.\u201d\n\nHe left before I could tell him I had already eaten something that had reminded me what my uncle\u2019s blood tastes like in metaphor. I finished with the east ear and the west ear and the little childish light that pretended to be reassurance. I wrote two numbers down in a place the bead could see and an entirely different pair in the place my body keeps for tiresome arithmetic. Then I went home because there was nothing useful I could do with the hour except prepare to be useful later, and preparation is a kind of mercy your future self will beat you for if you fail at it.\n\nMy door let me in politely, which is a neat trick, as I have trained it to be rude. The plant in the window was not more alive than it had been at dawn. I kissed it anyway and it cracked in my fingers and I laughed because death is sometimes boyish and that is funny in a horrible way. I made a pan of beans with garlic and cumin and I warmed a hunk of bread that had been ugly since birth and perfect since the oven. I wrote a note to Fenn that said: if I fall asleep, wake me with swear words. I took a shower where the water temperature missed twice and hit once and I forgave it like a woman with poor taste forgives a lover because he remembers to bring tea. I lay down. I put my hand on my own stomach and thought about the lock living in guts, and I spoke to my intestines as if they had ears. Then I closed my eyes and let my head fill with pipes and stairs and the distance between the boy\u2019s epaulets and the place under the Old Post where the wall had thinned to save money.\n\nAt eleven, Vetch sent me a single dot, which is the city\u2019s version of a kiss when it doesn\u2019t want to be cute. I sat up. I put my nails in my pocket because the alarms like coins. I put two cat treats in the other pocket because there is a monster of a tabby that owns the alley near the Old Post and likes to be bribed to not scream at the wrong minute. I shut off the lights. I locked the door and tested it, and I told myself that if I did not come back to this room, someone would keep the plant company anyway. It is a ridiculous thought to use as a charm. It works as well as any.\n\nThe streets at eleven belong to men who want to own them and to women who know how to survive men who want to own anything. I made myself smaller than important men see, and larger than men who think a woman alone is a type of weather. The air had gotten chilly in that way that isn\u2019t personal; the vents had chosen economy over comfort in an inverse-elegant equation I would have admired if I hadn\u2019t been carrying the taste of a word in my mouth like a crumb that would not dissolve. The Old Post\u2019s facade looked innocent in the polite glow from the lights the city installs to show it cares for heritage. Innocence is a lie sheet marble learned to pull over itself a long time ago.\n\nFenn slid out of the shadow across the street like a bulletin you\u2019re not supposed to see and already memorized. She had a bag that looked like it had onions in it and probably did. She had dirt on her face because she is clever about which faces men look at and which they don\u2019t. She did not touch me. She stood close enough that if a truck sprayed the gutter we would both get our shoes wet. That is intimacy in a city like ours.\n\n\u201cYou owe me beans,\u201d she said, mildly, which meant: this is very, very bad and we are going to do it anyway because we are built to fix things until we can\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI made you beans,\u201d I said, because if I did not answer in the same tone my mouth was going to start chanting the lock and scare pigeons.\n\n\u201cThe cat is out,\u201d she said, and she jerked her chin at the low wall near the gutter. The monster tabby regarded me with contempt like a god considering whether to bother with a thunderbolt. I tossed the treats. The cat ate them out of manners. We went in under the rail and through the mean little door we had made mean on purpose. Somebody had scuffed their boots in here earlier today on purpose to make it look like a drunk slept in it last week. The wall breathed. The bone hummed somewhere far enough away that if you hadn\u2019t put your mouth on it you would think you were hearing your own blood.\n\nThe crawl took us under three offices and one room where a woman prayed with the television on. It took us past a little house of old ducts somebody had decorated with cigarette cartons and a drawing of a man with antlers. It took us to the place the Old Post connects to the bank, to the seam where the builder had told the apprentice to use mortar like he meant it and a decade later a different builder had decided to pretend he agreed. It took us to a metal door with a name under the paint nobody uses anymore: UNION. The door had been welded at both sides, then un-welded, then welded again, a story written in bead and bad moods. I put my ear to it. The ear I keep for stories did not hear one. The ear I keep for men in uniforms heard the quiet of orders being preserved in human throats. Fenn touched the floor with her fingertips and then drew one in the air three inches up: skin of dust. No recent traffic. That was a lie. The honorable thing to do with a lie like that is to agree with it out loud so it thinks it won.\n\nVetch\u2019s dot turned into a comma. The comma meant: not yet. It meant: wait on your haunches like a dog that loves the hand that hits it for the food it sometimes offers. Fenn took a nest of wire out of her bag and cradled it the way some women cradle a child. The wire did not coo. It thought about being a bird and decided it liked its shape. I pressed my back to the wall because the wall and I are long acquaintances and I needed to borrow some of its apathy. The vents three corridors over turned their shoulders and pretended to cough to hide the sound nobody was supposed to hear. Then the nobody became somebodies.\n\nThey came like a story people have told themselves to be brave, which is to say: they came in the wrong order, confident men first, competent men second, the camera third. The boy with the epaulets had turned himself out for the night like a bride. His collar could have cut you if you had the wrong dreams. His fur was brushed to a gloss that embarrassed his species. He was flanked by two Cord with arms like the pillars outside, their eyes soft and wide in the way that would make children love them and their bodies unforgiving. Ketu walked behind the boy as if he had been invited to a parade at which he would be required to hold his breath for four blocks and congratulate himself later for the way he\u2019d presented his lungs. Harun was in the middle like a hinge between two doors. His face looked like the inside of the word tired. There was a mouth guard at his throatboard because the Cord hate the idea that a voice could be wiser than a baton. He held his shoulders as if his hands were behind his back even though they were not, out of long habit acquired in rooms where everything that worked was ugly.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d the boy said, with the pleasure of a guest who has slept in your best bed and then tells you your sheets weren\u2019t thread count enough for his skin. \u201cHere is the lesson. You make men fear the rain, they come around to calling you a roof. You make a machine breathe on command, they call you modern. Make it breathe.\u201d\n\nKetu put his hands behind his back and watched the ceiling the way men who know they are going to be held responsible for gravity\u2019s behavior do. One of the Cord moved forward with the portable console, his fingers deft in that way men\u2019s fingers get when they learn to make violence look like typing. The boy put his mouth near Harun\u2019s ear like a lover and whispered, and I could hear none of it because the wall is chaste when it wants to be. Harun\u2019s mouth twisted. He had nothing to say with it. The ratio slept under my tongue like a dog with one eye open. I could feel the far valves I had just taught to be hard of hearing sit up straighter in their sleep.\n\nVetch\u2019s comma flickered and became three dots, which is a trick he learned from women he has loved poorly: hesitate for drama and then deliver a straight line. Fenn\u2019s wire became not-wire, a listening thing that wanted a story. Ketu shifted his weight. The boy lifted his chin. Then something not human listened to something deeply human and tried to decide which of the two it would rather understand.\n\nThey started the show with an innocuous cough of air. The Old Post obliged because it had manners. They tried a whistle, ultra, the kind only children who don\u2019t sleep can hear. The east ear pretended to be stupid and did not turn. The west ear turned a degree and then sulked. The boy\u2019s mouth got that thinness it gets when a plan will require more words than he respects. He made a small gesture with two fingers and the Cord to his left changed the angle on the console\u2019s screen, as if throwing light differently would make physics flatter itself into compliance. Ketu watched the light and not the boy. I watched Ketu\u2019s mouth not smile.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve given your flock a shepherd,\u201d the boy said, and he made it sound like we had offended his god by saving our lives. \u201cYou\u2019ve made yourself necessary. It\u2019s such an old trick I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re still clever enough to try it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTeach the flock to know its cousins,\u201d Harun said, because he had been keeping that sentence under his tongue for six years in case he had an audience. \u201cTeach it who is human to it. Teach it to sing a different ratio when a certain mouth is dead.\u201d\n\nThe boy looked bored because he had no other safe expression to wear at a sentence like that. He put two fingers under Harun\u2019s chin because he wanted to pretend that was intimacy instead of leverage. Ketu said nothing because he belongs to a different theology where touching a prisoner\u2019s chin is beneath a man with rank. I moved my fingers over the screws in the dark the way a woman will move her fingers over beads when she wants to live through a prayer. Fenn breathed like a horse does when the gate opens and it is time.\n\nWhen they realized the flock wouldn\u2019t dance to their whistle, the boy lost interest in instruments and gained it in knives. He turned to Ketu and made a shape with his mouth that meant: permission to bully. Ketu made a shape with his eyes that meant: I accept the fiction of your authority as long as it doesn\u2019t make me drown a child. The two Cord who had been standing as pillars softened. One took a step that meant: pain is coming for you, old man, and you have lived long enough to recognize its gait. Harun, my hinge, my hinge, breathed out as if he were relieved to be alive in a moment when he could be afraid and funny at once. He looked in the direction of the wall where there was no camera and said very softly: \u201cRain.\u201d\n\nI kissed my teeth and the east ear listened. Vetch\u2019s dots turned into a dash and then an O, and the bone under our feet remembered the ratio not as a word but as a kindness you could do a machine. The air in the corridor behind the boy made the polite choice and decided to leave. The pressure drop was small and ungentle. It made ears pop. It made the mandrill\u2019s whiskers shiver. It made the console decide it was lonely and needed a memory. The lights did the thing we call an apology, a stutter as if they had regretted being bulbs and wanted to be stars. Fenn\u2019s wire laughed without making an indecent noise. The two Cord turned their heads like men about to say \u201cwhat\u201d in the tone that starts riots and ends marriages. Ketu stepped to the left in such a way that if a gun came out, the bullet would be tired before it made a mistake.\n\nThe boy did not ask permission. He never meant to. He reached for the weapon because that is what boys do when someone calls them ordinary and they want to be extraordinary and the only dictionary they trust has pictures of machines that throw fire. He did not get there. Ketu\u2019s hand moved, a small, private disagreement he had with the air between the boy and the holster, and the disagreement went the way his hands prefer. The gun stayed. The boy\u2019s mouth made a little shape that embarrassed him, and because embarrassment is a gas that travels, I almost laughed like a sinner. Then I did the thing that was mine to do and pulled the flange two degrees when no one was looking, and the pocket we had made for this moment drank, and the corridor shrugged off the beautiful boy\u2019s posture like a coat that had never fit. Harun stepped without permission and became a man going to get a glass of water. You could not have told, if you didn\u2019t know him, that he had just decided to remind his body what running is for.\n\nWe didn\u2019t go back the way we had come. That is a luxury for people who like to believe in maps. We went into the past instead, through a stair that had been bricked and then unbricked and then bricked again by men who loved hammers more than subtlety. Fenn threw her wire over his shoulder like a scarf and muttered three words in a dialect I hadn\u2019t heard since my father was alive. A door remembered it had been a door. It cut its own nostalgia with a small squeal like a child and opened its little mouth. We slithered into a gap that wanted to be smaller and then forgave us. Behind us, Ketu did something elegant and violent that made the boy cough politely and remember to ask himself if he was willing to be a murderer under the sixth rib in the month of a religious holiday. The corridor we became belonged to mice and lovers and electricians who have retired with two bad knees and more dreams than sleep. We trod like people who had memorized the sound of themselves and were trying to play a different song.\n\nWe came out under a stairwell I did not know I had always known, the one where the graffiti of an old campaign winked at me like a friend, and the smell of fried dough told me the world was rude enough to offer us food in the middle of someone else\u2019s coup. Harun wheezed like a man who has held his breath at the wrong times for thirty years. He held the railing and grinned at me without apology because he does not know how to apologize for still breathing. I would have hit him out of love if we had had time.\n\nWe did not have time. The city had taken our math and gotten drunk on it like a favorite uncle. Fenn pushed a door with her foot that didn\u2019t want to open, and it remembered it had been made for this and performed its little miracle. We fell into the room beyond\u2014one of those rooms that exists because a building needed a place to put its shame for a few years\u2014and found ourselves in a forest of metal ladders and dust ghosts. Vetch\u2019s shadow flicked into being and then cut itself off, which meant the back way was compromised and the front way was face. We did not want face. We chose balance.\n\nHarun sat on a crate of old labels and let his head fall forward for three seconds, exactly three, then lifted it because he will not let his body own him for long if anyone is watching. \u201cWe count again,\u201d he said, as if he had not just turned epaulets into pigeons and risked making me choose to eat him tomorrow. \u201cWhat do we move next. What do we make obedient for a minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mouth,\u201d Fenn said, with no particular venom, and she put a clean cloth in his hands as if he were six. \u201cDrink. Then tell us whether the boy will try sweet or salt if he fails tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cSweet,\u201d Harun said, because he has a nose for men like a dog for a storm. \u201cHe will be at a camera by morning talking about unity and the danger of monopolizing utilities and how the Chancellor is a sentimentalist. He will offer to carry a bucket on-screen like he knows where water goes.\u201d He wiped his face with the cloth and left a stark mark on it like a lesson. \u201cHe will call me a relic. He will not name me. He will be gracious about it. Graciousness is a weapon when you think the field is yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we break his weapon,\u201d I asked, and I did not mean the gun this time. \u201cDo we make the flock dance in public to a song he cannot sing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harun said, and he surprised me by not being hungry for theatre when he had just rehearsed it to a good review. \u201cWe make the flock boring. We make it obedient to nothing but gravity and a few women\u2019s hands. We put our names on bolts in places he has no camera for. We turn the part of the keystone that looks best in photographs into an idiot, and we move the clever into the marrow. We make it so that when he thinks he is calling for a reversal he is ringing for a janitor to bring a mop.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good trick,\u201d Fenn said, admiring despite herself. \u201cDo you have any idea how many idiots will take credit for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Harun said, and he touched my wrist with his fingers warm and rough and a little greasy because he is himself again, finally. \u201cAnd we will let them. We will build a city out of their vanity and our labor and our grief. You in.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was in when the hinge knocked,\u201d I said, because I am a woman who loves stupidly and bolts, and one of those things is going to get me killed in glory or boredom, and either way I intend to make the angle of a thing true before I go.\n\nWe slept in shifts in that room with the ladders. It smelled like old paper and mice and the inside of a pocket, and when I woke to Fenn\u2019s ankle nudging my hip, I had a dream stuck to my tongue that tasted like rust and figs. Morning did its waiter routine again and spilled light across the floor with better balance this time. The radio-that-pretends-it-isn\u2019t in the street said the Chancellor would speak at noon to say nothing in a way that sounded like law. The boy with the epaulets sent a human to the market to buy a basket of mangos and have himself filmed giving it to an old woman who knew enough to take the fruit and not the story. Ketu\u2019s pigeons rearranged themselves so that one would shit on the boy\u2019s jacket at the correct minute for comedy. I went with Fenn to the place between the keystone\u2019s public mouth and its private throat. I carried a shim and a plan and the taste of a word. I did not look up at the ribs, because if you look at ribs too much you start to believe they are protecting you.\n\nWe moved weight. We moved it in handfuls, which is the only way I know. We hid the clever behind ugliness. We gave the stupid a good paint job and told it to smile. Men in vests argued with me about the phrase structural redundancy as if I had not been married to it for a decade. Fenn lied to a drone politely and showed it two nails so it would think we were poor and go away to find someone cooler. Vetch sent us a folded scrap of paper from a boy whose hands were too clean. The scrap had a list: three valves to turn with sorrow, two frames to notch like a lover\u2019s name, a rivet to leave loose in a place where only a cat can see. Uncle Harun did the work he does best, which is to make a room he is not in behave, and which is also a terrible magic I can forgive because he taught me to do it and my hands love him.\n\nBy noon, the city had decided the day would be handsome. The Chancellor\u2019s voice flowed out of the vents like a practiced weather, temperate and ripe. He said a thing about social fabric that made mothers nod and a thing about innovation that made boys in logos feel like fathers. He talked about the keystone as if it were a little god. He did not say what any of us who own a wrench know: that gods die the minute you give them a schedule. I tightened a collar on a pipe with five hundred names carved in its insulation and tried very hard to believe that the mouth that would one day have to say the word to save this city belonged to a woman whose grief could be eaten by a machine and still be human after.\n\nWhen he was done, when the applause had done its job, when the boy with the epaulets had washed the pigeon shit off his jacket in a bathroom with a picture of a fish on the door, my phone made a sound like a stone dropped into water, and the map bloomed with a little violet star that was not where it should be. It sat over Glass Row. It sat over my mother\u2019s block. It sat over her kitchen. The star did not move. It pulsed once, as if it were embarrassed to be a star and would rather be a hinge. Then Vetch wrote a word I have learned to respect in a city that likes to write poetry when it needs to punch you: home.The word sat on the screen like a drop of oil on water, too slick to touch with a finger, too heavy to ignore. Home had never been neutral in my mouth. It was a room and a person and an argument and a spice that burned even when you wanted sweet. I did not think. My body had already begun to move because it likes to do the simplest arithmetic first: distance divided by legs, time divided by breath. Fenn saw my face shift, saw the color of the star mirrored in my eyes, and she didn\u2019t ask. She hooked the bag to her shoulder and fell in at my left like we had rehearsed this exact run. Maybe we had, every time we had carried a pipe through a crowd and people had moved without seeing that we were the reasons their air would be kind later.\n\nThe middle tiers showed their teeth as we pushed through. Somewhere a choir was practicing again because the city was greedy for harmony, or because someone was measuring how many notes it took to keep the boys with cameras from noticing the scaffolds where the keystone was uglier than promised. The lift had a line of people with damp collars and patient jaws. We took the stairs because I am superstitious about boxes when my blood is doing math. I counted the risers I know by heart, my palms sliding the greasy rail where hands had written their skin for a decade. There are little stories everywhere in this city. The one under my hand said: don\u2019t let go; the one under my feet said: we carry you and we squeal but we do not break yet.\n\nOn Glass Row the light was a clean lie. The window washers had finished their run and the panes wore their skins like a fancy suit with stains hidden in the hems. The market was bright and fussy and pretend-safe. The boy with the wrong epaulets had sent his camera to another square by now, a place with better shadows. My mother\u2019s block smelled like sugar char and metal polish and the detergent the clinic gave out in packets with a stupid logo printed on them in blue. I had never understood who the logo was supposed to comfort. People comfort themselves with the idea of order. Machines comfort themselves with the rhythm of being allowed to run.\n\nThe green of my door looked like it had been repainted by a person trying to remember an old recipe and substituting salt for sugar. Vetch\u2019s violet star sat right over it and pulsed again as if it were breathing. I put my ear to the panel and there was a wrong silence on the other side, a silence that had organized itself with chairs and good intentions. Fenn\u2019s shoulder brushed mine and that was her way of saying: I am here; I will not let you do this alone; if I die, make it at least a little funny. I bent and touched the seam with my nails because I wanted the bead in the jamb to look at something small and inexpensive while I did something big and costly. The lock was keyed to my pressure and breath. It obeyed, loyal and stupid and mine. The door opened two fingers\u2019 width and stopped as if someone inside was holding it with the tips of a hand.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a hand. It was a string. A trick my mother hates because tricks that rely on women\u2019s fastidiousness offend her. I slid my blade into the gap and lifted the thread off its hook before it could tell a bell to sing, and the bell, poor thing, slut for drama, kept its notes to itself. I made the gap a palm, then an arm, then a person. The smell hit first. Not smoke. Not blood. Cardamom and milk and the faint medicinal clean of the clinic\u2019s favorite wipe, and under all that the iron of a pan that had been left on a burner just long enough to think about turning black. You would not have known anything was wrong except the cups were too clean and the plant on the sill was too upright. My mother does not overwater her plants. She threatens them with religion and neglects them into vigor. Someone had given this one attention. That was how you knew a stranger had loved your house.\n\nShe was at the table with her back to the door, her hair tied up with a scarf old enough to have been a flag at one of the marches she denies she attended. She held a spoon. She was stirring nothing. She did not turn when I came in. She did not say my name in the tone that means: you did not text and I am pretending to be wounded for fun. She said, \u201cIf that pot was supposed to boil, it would have boiled.\u201d Her voice was too even. She is never even. Evenness is a betrayal her mouth does not forgive.\n\n\u201cMa,\u201d I said, and I had to make the word heavier than it wanted to be or it would have flown out the window. \u201cWe got a message. Are you all right.\u201d\n\n\u201cI made beans,\u201d she said. The spoon clinked. The pot did not answer. \u201cYour uncle eats like a bird but he licks the spoon. He is vain about the sound it makes if you put the spoon down hard enough.\u201d She put the spoon down and didn\u2019t make a sound. Fenn stayed at the door, one foot inside, one out, a hinge with a pulse.\n\n\u201cThey came,\u201d I said, and my mouth made a straight line like I could put facts on it and have them balance. \u201cDid they come. How many. Did they leave anything,\u201d and I almost laughed because of course they had, they had left their smell on the plant and their hands on the air and the feeling in my feet that the kitchen had shifted half a degree under us.\n\n\u201cThey came like birds,\u201d my mother said. \u201cThey stayed like men.\u201d She turned then and I saw the way the skin had tightened around her eyes, not from crying. She does not cry when men come to tell her things she already knew about where power lives. She gets sparse. She puts her words in the drawer where she keeps her mysteries because she thinks if the words sit still they will outlast the day. \u201cHe was here. The mouth boy. He was very clean. He didn\u2019t sit. He looked at my cups and then he looked at my hands and I could see his brain thinking: these hands will not be my hands and that makes me angry.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he touch you,\u201d Fenn asked, and I loved her for the bluntness of it because sometimes language has to drop its jewelry and ask ugly questions.\n\n\u201cHe put his eyes on me like a thumb,\u201d my mother said, and she closed her hand around the air so precisely the air behaved like a thing you could bruise. \u201cHe brought a basket of fruit and a man with teeth named a different language than mine and a woman who thought I might ask her for help. I did not ask.\u201d She looked at me the way she used to look at my report cards when I was twelve and had decided to fail art because the teacher was cruel about perspective. \u201cHe said the Chancellor is old and the city is new and that old women like me should stop breaking cramps into its calves.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you said,\u201d I asked, because part of me was in another room of another year listening to her pull a man\u2019s words apart with a fork and feed him the pieces until he apologized to his own mother for learning to walk in a world that had not taught him to bow.\n\n\u201cI said my cramps were older than his mother\u2019s milk,\u201d she said. \u201cHe liked that. He likes it when women are knives. He doesn\u2019t mind bleeding if it makes a picture. I told him we reused lids and that we do not trust clean-jacket boys with soft eyes who use words like unity as if we all owned the same walls. He set his basket down on my counter anyway, like an offering. He said: tell your brother we would like the bone song. He said: tell your daughter we will make her a suit that fits. That is when I decided to be still because if I was not still I would have killed him with my spoon.\u201d\n\nFenn exhaled a small laugh that was shaped like a swear if you held it to the light. I went to the counter and looked at the basket because I am a fool for objects. The mangos were perfect in the way expensive fruit is always perfect. The oranges had their leaves still attached as if they had gotten lost on their way from the orchard to the set. There was a card. There is always a card in this city because men like to write their names on other people\u2019s air. The card said: With respect, M. It tried to be modest and failed at it like modesty fails when it meets a camera.\n\n\u201cDid you take anything,\u201d I asked, because poison is ordinary where I grew up. You check. You make people drink first who brought you delights. You do not eat fruit from men who want your city\u2019s throat.\n\nMy mother snorted, and in that sound was all the contempt she has for the idea that a mandrill\u2019s politeness could trick her into eating a story. \u201cI put the basket in the oven,\u201d she said. \u201cI turned the oven on for a minute. Let him smell his mangos become jam. He did not like that. He said it was waste. He has never met a pantry.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe left anything of his,\u201d I asked, because I was thinking of the hinge and how they had learned we answered to objects with a memory.\n\n\u201cHe left a shadow,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is in the corner by the plant. I have not swept it yet. I was waiting for you. I thought you might tell me whether it is good luck or bad.\u201d\n\nI went to the corner like I could kneel to a superstition and have it tell me an engineering truth. There was nothing to see. There was a temperature that had not yet joined the room. There was a smell like a shirt taken off politely. There was a little grease thumbprint low on the wall where a person would steady himself if he leaned to look under the radiator for a listening device. I touched it with my nail and the print lifted the way soft gum lifts threads. I pinched it and let the bead in my pocket taste it. The bead told me, in its dumb consumer way, that the grease contained a perfume that sells itself with the word cedar and a machine oil that only the Cord buys in this particular formulation because the supplier is a cousin of somebody who looped them in during the seventeenth minute of an old revolution and now cannot not take their order. I wiped the bead with a dishtowel because even my paranoia has manners in my mother\u2019s kitchen.\n\n\u201cWhat did he want truly,\u201d my mother asked, and she did not mean the bone song. She meant the shape under the shape, the mouth under the mask.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to know which door we will choose when the city asks us to be a hinge,\u201d I said, and my voice was too steady because I was performing for my mother and I know better and I could not do better right now. \u201cHe wanted to know whether he can pull you and have me fall like a kettle on a hook.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not a kettle,\u201d she said, and her mouth did a thing like she was remembering a joke my father told before he became a memory. \u201cYou are a wrench with a temper.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay wrench again,\u201d I said, and we both laughed because sometimes love needs a word that is a sound your mouth makes that isn\u2019t I\u2019m sorry or I forgive you.\n\n\u201cThey took nothing,\u201d she said then, and the laugh turned into a rope again, something for both of us to hold. \u201cThey left a promise. He said he would come back with a camera and a priest. He said I would want to be seen forgiving him. I told him to bring better shoes.\u201d\n\nThe violet star on my phone dimmed, as if satisfied that I had done the arithmetic and shown my work. Vetch sent a second word, a little one that tries to be brave and usually is: later. Ketu did not text. Ketu would not text in my mother\u2019s kitchen because this room does not want certain uniforms to learn its scent.\n\n\u201cMa,\u201d I said, and this was going to cost, and I let it. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a thing that looks like a party at the keystone tomorrow and it will be a party only for men who like to watch water pretend to be art. If it smells wrong, if people start pointing toward the vents with more interest than a tourist, if you see somebody who looks like the boy\u2019s mouth but not his eyes, you go to the clinic. Harun has keys. Vetch has a door that wants to like you. Do not stand in a window. Do not let a camera into your list of mugs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not young,\u201d she said, and she meant: you think I have not done this dance before.\n\n\u201cYou are mine,\u201d I said, and I felt the order of the world inside my bones try to argue with me and then give up because right now it needed to be in the mouth as a fact. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\nShe put her spoon down for real this time and the spoon made the right sound. She stood. She crossed the room and did the thing she had not done in three years and three months and nine days. She put her hand on the back of my neck and pulled my forehead gently against her shoulder like I was a hot pan that needed holding with a cloth. My body did something ungenerous with my lungs for a second and then forgave me for surviving. Fenn looked at the plant as if it were an instrument she could tune and not a witness to sacred nonsense.\n\n\u201cYou think he will make you eat your uncle,\u201d my mother said into my hair, plain as bread, because she cannot not say the sentence that matters once she has used up all her patience on men with baskets.\n\n\u201cI think the city will,\u201d I said, and the truth of it made the tile under my feet think about becoming ocean. \u201cHe is only a boy with coins. The city is a god with habits.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you will brush your teeth and say your prayers and you will tell your stomach to be proud of itself,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not made to be pets to gods. We are made to fix them when they go stupid. If you must eat grief, chew. Don\u2019t swallow whole. Your grandmother taught me that and she was bite marks from head to toe by the time she died and still she did not choke.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate you,\u201d I said, because it would be too big to say the other thing. \u201cI hate that you talk good and it works.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said, and she kissed my temple in the small old way that makes you think of a broom leaning, not a trumpet gone off. \u201cHate makes your hands sharp. Go fix. Bring me my brother if you can. Bring me a rumor if you can\u2019t. Bring me back my pot if they take it.\u201d\n\nWe did not linger because lingering builds altars to fear. We took her empty pan and her clean spoon because props convince the eye and we needed to look like women doing domestic things, not women walking out of a room that had just been told it was a set. In the hall, the neighbor\u2019s child had fallen asleep on a slab of cardboard like a king on a raft. Someone had drawn a mustache on the Chancellor\u2019s face in a poster with a biro that had been running out of ink for five minutes and was valiant about it anyway. A Cord we didn\u2019t know leaned on the far corner and pretended to be bored. His ears were too clean. His shoes were wrong. You could tell he was not from here because he did not look down to avoid stepping on the corner where everybody knows the tile cracks and will bite your foot if you don\u2019t respect it.\n\nHe said, \u201cAfternoon,\u201d and the way he said it was not a question or a challenge because he had been taught better by someone who cares about logistics.\n\n\u201cEvening,\u201d Fenn said, and the distance between those words was a line of infantry. He glanced at the pan. He glanced at my face like he had a gun he didn\u2019t want to draw and a history he didn\u2019t want to explain. I inclined my head because I am tired of making enemies when all I\u2019ve got in my hands is a spoon and somebody else\u2019s plant dirt on my sleeve.\n\nOn the stairs, the building\u2019s old song returned, the creak and reassure of a place that had learned to hold all the absurd weights we ask of it and still not collapse. We did not talk until we were past the place where the boy with the epaulets would have put a microphone if he had thought of it, and he hadn\u2019t because he thinks microphones live in rooms with better chairs. I blew out a breath and almost tasted the ratio again because it has moved in like a tenant who will clean if you feed it.\n\n\u201cI was ready to hit him with the pan,\u201d Fenn said, cheerful and savage because she refuses to let fear be the only animal in her mouth. \u201cI would have rung him like the bells in the old temple we don\u2019t have. It would have been elegant.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would have felt good in your elbow,\u201d I said, and I could picture the arc her arm would make, perfect geometry in a space that wanted a new line. \u201cHe left a smell. They\u2019re going to script a forgiveness tomorrow. They\u2019ll want my mother to be a saint in their movie.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not a saint,\u201d Fenn said, and she loves my mother as much as she can love anyone who is not a machine that needs her. \u201cShe\u2019s a knife. They can put a halo on a knife. It still cuts.\u201d\n\nWe crossed the plaza with the sculpture that used to be a fish or a promise. Vetch\u2019s shadow slouched off a wall and attached itself to our heels with the courtesy of a cat deciding to escort you as far as the door. He didn\u2019t materialize because he does not materialize when my mother has watched us walk away. He respects a woman\u2019s sightline. He sent a single message instead, not even a word, an old symbol our parents learned to write on walls when walls were good for writing on: an eye. He was not telling me not to sleep. He was telling me we were being loved by the city\u2019s worst and best gossip at once.\n\nThe afternoon had the exhausted quality days get when they have been made to wear costumes. The keystone crew packed their cables into bins like ribs into a trunk, careful with the things they could bill for, careless with the things they could not. Ketu posted himself where the upper tier\u2019s shadow cut the atrium in half, an unowned timepiece. He watched nothing with the attentiveness other men use for a lover\u2019s face. Once, his eyes brushed mine and it felt like being checked by a good mechanic: you knew what he would find, and you were already ashamed of the parts you hadn\u2019t replaced yet. He didn\u2019t nod. He didn\u2019t move. He let the city\u2019s wind make an argument against his jacket and the jacket lost.\n\nWe worked until our muscles made that happy low complaint that tells you they believe in you again. We sorted lies into piles. We taught two more valves to be stupid on purpose. We tucked a wedge where it would look like a manufacturer\u2019s mistake until the day it saved a crowd of children from a show of pressure in a pipe that should not have been flirted with. I sent a kid with wrongs tattooed on his knuckles to the upper freight lift with a spool of cable and no paper so he could watch who stopped him and who didn\u2019t. He came back with a new scratch on his jaw and a grin that said: I am doing something larger than a paycheck and I will regret it later and I love you for it.\n\nAt dusk the light did its cinematic trick across the glass and the banners looked like knives on a wall. People took pictures that will live forever in little black boxes until their children cannot remember what their faces looked like without the filter that pretends this color is how the world always was. The Chancellor\u2019s schedule leaked to the street like a clean sock out of a laundry bag. He would be in the lower wards at eight, shaking hands with a man who sells noodles and a woman with a cat that meows like a fax. The boy with the epaulets would be on a balcony at seven, reading a poem written by someone his staff had found who could make the word infrastructure rhyme with a word you would want to put in your mouth twice. Those are the nights you hate this city and love it enough to kill for it.\n\nWe were wiping our tools with someone else\u2019s clean rags when the alarms at the corner of Glass Row and the clinic\u2019s alley hiccuped. It wasn\u2019t the siren. It was a small sound a careful system makes when it has sensed a human making a human\u2019s mistake. Fenn\u2019s head went to the side, listening like a cat. My phone did the stone-in-water sound again. Vetch\u2019s eye turned into a line and then into a word. He is careful with his words even when he wants to be dramatic. He wrote: drawer.\n\nI didn\u2019t run. I walked because that is scarier when you leave a place and you want everyone with eyes to understand that your bones are doing math and the answer is: inevitable. Fenn fell in two steps behind me. The clinic\u2019s brick had been scrubbed by someone in a good mood last week. The door was half ajar because the clinic believes in access and has been punished for it and refuses to stop being itself. The waiting room smelled like the end of the day: bandage glue and baby sugar and a bowl of soup cooling itself on a desk because the nurse who brought it had remembered at last that she was a person. A child sat on a man\u2019s lap and played with a rubber syringe like a gun and his mother took it from him gently and lied with her eyes about why he could not have it. Behind the curtain three voices braided a number. The number was wrong and then fixed. The back hall had a scuff I put there when I was fourteen and learning how not to run in homes that are not houses.\n\nThe drawer lived in the kitchen because kitchens are where you keep your gods if you are honest about what you feed. My mother had told me about placing things in it without looking at them, without naming them, a ritual of respectful ignorance. I had never opened it without her because superstition is a tool I respect even when I do not obey it. The drawer was open now. Inside, the ribbon, the doll, the buttons. The green ashy strip from the election where we ate boiled rice in a room full of men who didn\u2019t clap for the right reason. The tiny carved fish my father made out of a pipette pip while the generator sang a dirty lullaby in the corner. And on top, laid like a hand you didn\u2019t ask to hold yours, a new hinge. Not the one from Red Stairs. This one hadn\u2019t been cleaned. It had its rust on, scabbed and true. Where the other had the memory of a door the city had taught to open and close on a list of crimes, this one had nothing but door in it, the simple honest weight of two worlds agreeing to meet and then part on schedule.\n\nUnder the hinge lay a piece of paper folded so many times it had learned to become almost square. I looked at Fenn and she looked at me and we both agreed with our faces that we were going to do the wrong thing and call it loyalty. I unfolded the paper. In the square was a drawing a child could have made if the child had known how to draw accurate. It was my mother\u2019s block, sketched in with a house where the plant is and a balcony where the boy dumps water on himself and crows. There was a cross on my mother\u2019s kitchen. There was a line drawn from the kitchen to a dot under the street. There was a word in my uncle\u2019s careful technical hand where people used to write other people\u2019s names on the backs of photographs and pretend that would preserve them from being forgotten. The word was not a word. It was the symbol we use in my unit when we are telling each other there is a bleed you can use, the way you nick a hose to let the pressure escape so your hands don\u2019t get bit when you unscrew the collar.\n\n\u201cThey put a throat under her sink,\u201d Fenn said, and the awe in it was complicated because it takes gall to run a pipe that close to a woman like my mother. \u201cHe hid it in her house. He hid a god under her soup.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a god,\u201d I said, and I touched the hinge the way I would touch a cat I cannot trust. \u201cA confession. A choice. He gave her the lever and trusted her not to flip the room over when she got mad.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we tell her,\u201d Fenn asked, simple as switches, and I did not know whether to love her or hate her for the way she asks so well.\n\n\u201cWe show her,\u201d I said, because my mother\u2019s respect cannot be coerced. \u201cIf they come back with their cameras and their priest and their mangos, she needs not a speech. She needs a knob she can turn with her old hands and make a boy learn his name.\u201d\n\nWe went to the sink like thieves with manners. We pulled the pot aside. We kept the spoon on the table where she had set it, a promise to put things back. The panel under the basin had a crack where a crack should not be. The fixings wore their age with pride. Behind the board lived the cage that keeps industrious rodents out of your plumbing and useful rodents in it. Behind the cage, a throat. Not big. Big would be felt. Small and precise. Older pipe married to new with the kind of elegance I have to call pretty out loud or it will become a sin in my chest. The throat had a turn that wasn\u2019t in the plan I had built in my head when I was fourteen and imagined I would wield a house like a wrench. It had a valve with a face that wanted to pretend it was part of the trap. It had a collar that would bite you if you insulted it.\n\nFenn held the light. I put my fingers in where my mother had never let me put my fingers because she raised me not to play with the house\u2019s guts. The valve purred when I touched it because it knew me the way a piece of inherited jewelry recognizes a wrist. Under my hand, the Vetch-song that ties appetite to pressure hummed once and then kept quiet because this throat was polite in a kitchen. The little bleed Harun had drawn waited like a scavenger, a quiet gift: if you open this, the pipe will confess before it screams; if you open this, the boy\u2019s console will think it has lost its voice and panic; if you open this in the forty seconds after a lie has gone on your mother\u2019s air, you will get to watch a camera make an ugly face and you will like it.\n\nWe put the board back. We set the pot just so. We put the hinge in the drawer and closed it. I wrote Vetch a sentence he would read three times to make sure it didn\u2019t say more than it said. He responded with a drawing of a pigeon with a halo, which was his idea of a joke about Ketu being an angel of the stupid. I washed my hands at my mother\u2019s sink and the water came out clean and made the sound it makes when it has decided to love you. We left the clinic without looking like we had done anything but argued about the right way to store cloves.\n\nNight came in a harder shirt. The city clicked into a different gear. Men who had not been outside since morning remembered they had bodies and those bodies needed salt. Women who hate the boys with cameras put on lipstick like war paint because if you are going to be seen you should at least choose your color. The keystone gleamed because lights had been hung on it the way people hang jewels on statues they do not actually pray to. The Chancellor\u2019s entourage made the air around them smell like expensive wool. The boy with the epaulets had a spot of darker fabric on his shoulder disguised with grooming and tragedy. Ketu stood at the east end of the rib I had taught to be dignified and looked like a man paying respect to a beast he cannot love because he loves its work too much.\n\nWe positioned ourselves where we could not be useful until we were, which is a skill I had to learn out of spite. Fenn took the rail above the gallery where the vests would clap on cue. I went to my mother\u2019s block because the star had told me home and the drawer had told me plan and my mother\u2019s hand on my neck had told me pick your grief, and I had chosen the one that let me fix something first. In her window, a plant I had thought was awake this morning had put on a new color. That was absurd. You cannot expect botany to conspire with politics. I laughed, small and ridiculous, because sometimes the city gives you a gift that is not for you and you take it anyway and pretend it will become a tool.\n\nThey came with their camera and their priest and their basket at seven-fifteen, right on schedule, men who think schedules are a moral instrument and not just a way to stack bodies neatly. The priest was the kind they train now, gentle and correct, able to look at you and make you feel like you are being blessed for surviving commerce. The camera was small and kind-looking. The basket had mangos in it that had not been in anyone\u2019s oven. The boy had put his mouth in the nice line, the one he uses when he wants mothers to like him the way they like certain television doctors. My mother opened the door and did not ask them to wipe their feet because she did not want them to believe they belonged to her floor. They asked her to forgive the new order for its sins. They asked her to bless the keystone with a woman\u2019s patience. They asked her to sing a lullaby to the vents, to show that the old women are with us.\n\nShe let them come into the kitchen because she is not afraid of other people using her light. She took the basket because you take the gift when it is offered in public or else you look mean and they use that as a weapon in the edit. She said a thing about fig cakes in a tone that made the priest want to laugh and made the boy want to remove his jacket and fight. Then the camera turned toward the sink because the sound person told it kitchens make good television, and I was already under the window in the alley with my hand in the crack the board makes and my fingers on the bleed my uncle had left for me like a blessing and a dare.\n\nThe voicework in a machine is holy when it is right. The camera\u2019s little mic greedily drank. The boy said the word unity the way men say the word when they mean obedience. My mother said the word patience the way women say it when they mean you are so lucky I am polite. The priest began the cadence that was going to be cut to make a song and live on a thousand screens and be used, afterward, as a hammer. I turned the bleed. It turned. The throat sighed. The console over in the keystone gallery coughed politely and forgot to do its trick. The air at the corner of the room decided not to be cool in the way cameras love because good cameras like a little sweat. The boy\u2019s mouth lost its soft. The priest said \u201coh\u201d and then disguised it as \u201camen.\u201d The camera saw nothing and that nothing will look like something later, and you will not be able to explain to your neighbor why you love this scene so much, but you will feel the tug in your throat that says: someone set a jaw somewhere and I can taste it.\n\nMy mother, goddess of my first breath and my last argument, looked straight into the lens and felt the lack of air the way only women who have cooked for people in rooms without windows can. She took the spoon and tapped it on the edge of the pot and made the right sound again and the little bell that boy hung by the hinge yesterday so pretty and sneaky forgot its name and did not ring. She said, \u201cNo,\u201d the way a woman says it when she is the door and not the hinge and you are the wind and you have forgotten your place.\n\nThey stood there and did not know where to put their hands because they had come expecting a ritual and got a rule. The boy looked over his shoulder like a kid in a schoolyard looking for his bigger cousin to back a play that has already failed. There was no cousin. There was only the city, and the city was uninterested in helping boys finish sentences that had cost us so much to learn. The priest did the correct thing, which was to lower his head and admit he was not what the room needed. The camera did the wrong thing, which was to keep filming, because cameras are hungry and never know when to say enough.\n\nIt was delicious, the tiny, mean thing that happened then, the way a trick has a taste. I am petty. I will die with grease under my nails and this petty sugar on my tongue. Vetch sent a dot in the shape of a giggle. Ketu, out there under the rib, coughed meaningfully, and anyone who hears that cough later will think he was clearing his throat to speak a line that was not his to say. The boy put the basket down again, harder, and one mango fell and rolled, and my mother stepped on it by accident, and the mango made a joke on the floor and the priest laughed because he could not help himself. You could feel the edit being made in a room with bad lighting by a man with sore wrists who does not actually hate people like me but will make my life harder because the boy pays him.\n\nWe did not gloat in public. We do not teach the city how we survive. I closed the bleed. The throat purred as if someone had petted the dog inside it. My mother told the boy he could leave his basket on the table and take back his spoonful of apology. He did not punch anybody. That is how you know he is a real danger and not a child. He left with the priest who had forgiven him for existing in the wrong shape because that is what priests do when they are right with themselves. The camera trailed after like a tired bird. When the door was shut and the hall was empty and the silence in the apartment belonged to the kitchen and not to a stranger\u2019s politely arranged chairs, my mother leaned out the window and looked down at the alley where I was still crouched like a burglar.\n\n\u201cYou are stupid,\u201d she said, love like a hot coal in her mouth because it burns and you keep it because it keeps you from freezing. \u201cYou are my child.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore the second than the first,\u201d I said, and I stood because my knees were going to remember this conversation in the morning. \u201cWe made him step on a mango.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think I do not appreciate art,\u201d she said, and she laughed once, low, private, the kind she saves for people who have earned hearing it. \u201cGo. The boy will bring you a present for what you did. It will have a hinge. It will come with a man who wants to be your friend. It will be wrapped in respect. Don\u2019t open it unless you are hungry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am always hungry,\u201d I said, and that was truer than it should be and wrong in all the ways that make a person useful to a city like ours. \u201cI will build something ugly tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake it beautiful,\u201d she said, and she meant: make it obedient to women\u2019s hands, not men\u2019s mouths. \u201cThen make it ugly on purpose where it counts.\u201d\n\nWe went back into the night toward the keystone\u2019s ribs, toward the bone\u2019s hum, toward the boy\u2019s camera, toward whatever new hinge the city thought it could bribe us with. Vetch\u2019s pigeons had arranged themselves to say a rude word in a language only a few of us still know. Ketu stood exactly where he had been, and when I passed him he did not look at me. He said, to nobody in particular, in a tone you could drink and not get drunk, \u201cThe wind is shifting.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does that,\u201d I said, without stopping. \u201cWe taught it.\u201d\n\nHe did not answer because he did not need to, because sometimes a city will let two people be a door without making either of them the hinge. We took the stairs, we kissed the bolts with our tools, we lied to the cameras with our faces, and somewhere in a room that smelled like milk and spices and a little like oil, my mother put a hinge in a drawer and kept it safe for a day when somebody needed to be reminded that doors are not just for pretty speeches.",

                              "content": "The first time I saw the Chancellor\u2019s knuckles, I knew we had built the podium wrong.\n\nIt was a petty thought to have in the middle of a coronation speech, with a hundred camera-eyes glinting in the glass ribs above the Assembly and a thousand murmurs mercurial as rain inside the atrium. But all I could see were the pressure lines\u2014fine crescent ridges in polished wood where a silverback\u2019s weight had changed the world\u2019s ergonomics.\n\nA human architect would have assumed a human penholder, would have shaped the microphone mount to catch human spit instead of a long, soft string of drool stretched across a mouth made for bark and bite. I watched him curl his fingers, thick pads and the chalky, cracked skin at the bend of every joint, and I thought: this is how real power touches a surface.\n\n\u201cPeople of the Crown, kin and sapients,\u201d Chancellor Umboto intoned. He had trained in three languages, but his voice found its confidence in the timbre of something older, a forest drum. The autoglossers hummed just behind his words, translating for the far corners of our cantonments; signers on the dais flickered finger-words in white gloves; the throatboard at his collar picked up the rasp and made of it something smooth. \u201cWe have come, together, beyond the forest and the glass. The old hands that held whips have been unbound, and now they hold tools.\u201d\n\nSomeone tittered. Someone hissed at the titter. Human breath swam through the building and caught on the lower scaffolds where I crouched, a borrowed wrench in my palm. The podium had been fitted with two shocks, not four. The screws had been measured in millimeters and not in pressures, so the whole thing sang when the Chancellor leaned forward, a mosquito-toned shiver impossible to hear on the floor but loud as guilt up here in the bones of the place.\n\nI loosened the collar that held the east fastener and tasted the coolant in the air, bitter as apples. Above me the skylight roped light like spun sugar; beyond that, beyond the gossamer webs that held a hundred thousand tons of rain in place above the carapace of our pretty city\u2014beyond all of it there were clouds. My mother had told me once how clouds smelled when they were inside you, when you lived under them without a dome. I only knew the chemical that pretended to be cloud.\n\n\u201cPlease forgive our... youthful imperfections,\u201d the Chancellor went on, amused. He had heard the podium\u2019s whisper, or he had heard the way the whisper changed the breathing of the people, or he had learned how to sense a room like a disturbance in a pond. He opened his hands, open palm showing the heavy labyrinth of lines that an elder\u2019s hands share with a tree\u2019s cut rings. \u201cWe are still learning to stand upright without bruising each other.\u201d\n\nMy wrench slipped, my knuckles knocked iron, and a drop of my blood fell through the lattice grid into the crowd. Nobody looked up, but I flinched like I\u2019d spat on a shrine. I wiped my hand. I tightened the fastener. The podium settled by exactly a half-centimeter. The ghost-whine dimmed. The Chancellor nodded, though he couldn\u2019t have known why he nodded. The Chancellor was good at giving to the air what the air demanded. That was why he was where he was. That, and the math of armies.\n\nA hand touched my ankle. \u201cMiren. You\u2019re leaking.\u201d\n\nI looked down into Fenn\u2019s face, a comic half moon under the catwalk\u2019s edge. Fenn worked in seals and gaskets; she had hair as black as a burned gasket and eyes like someone had kept a pair of honest olives for too long in saltwater. She offered me a square of gauze. \u201cHe\u2019s nearly done.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou listen to speaches now?\u201d I whispered, taking the gauze. The blood on the steel already looked older than a minute.\n\n\u201cOnly when a gorilla learns to rhyme.\u201d Fenn smiled without her eyes. \u201cAfter this we\u2019ve got to go check the south basins. There\u2019s a pressure leap. Or maybe a rat.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a rat, tell it the apes have the floor.\u201d I tucked the gauze into my glove and tightened the second collar. The podium stopped singing. The Chancellor took a breath, and he spoke the line everyone had been waiting for, the one they had sold to sixteen feed-streams in advance for more than I would ever make in my life.\n\n\u201cFrom this day,\u201d he said, \u201csapience acknowledges itself in the mirror and swears never to turn away again.\u201d\n\nThe people clapped. The apes clapped, which is something you never forget seeing: palms that could split your ribs in half finding a polite beat. I sat back on my heels and watched the braids and flags that hung over the stage sway in the AC wind. My palm stung. Fenn had gone already, quick as a roach. I should have gone too, but I was wet with the sense of having fixed something that mattered even if it was only a noise. It\u2019s a stupid weakness: to love the little victory, to savor the screw turned exactly right. To think the world is made of such screws at all, and not of meat and hunger.\n\nAt the edge of the dais, a young bonobo in a stiff, pale jacket held a tablet with both hands and looked like he wanted to throw up. His lips fluttered. He swallowed, looked out at the crowd and then at the Chancellor and then at nothing, then back like he might ask permission. The Chancellor turned to him and rested one massive hand on the younger ape\u2019s shoulder. They held each other\u2019s gaze. The Chancellor nodded, small, as if to say: it is terrifying to speak, but we are beyond terror. The young bonobo breathed again. He found his voice. Slowly, careful, he told us a law that was new. The law said what it needed to say to keep this city tall.\n\nBy the time it was over and everyone was pulling on their coats, I had wiped my hand again and counted the extra ticks in the AC\u2019s east vent and tried twice to pretend that I had no reason to look for someone in the bodies below. The someone looked for me anyway.\n\nHe loomed. He had always loomed. He even tried to stoop when he came up under the catwalk, but it only made his shoulders look wider. He opened his arms.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t pick a better time to cut yourself,\u201d Uncle Harun said, grinning, and then, as I made a face, \u201cMiren. Let me see.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. The Chancellor\u2019s podium. A love bite.\u201d\n\nHe took my hand and turned it palm-up. He was not a medic but he had worked as one for twenty years in a clinic that pretended it wasn\u2019t there; he had set bones with wire and sutured under lanterns and held children with fevers like dynamite. His fingers were elegant and stupidly strong. \u201cSo? Are we in love now?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get ugly,\u201d I said, even as he blew on the scrape and the cooler air made it sting cleanly again. I pulled out of his grip. \u201cWhy are you here? You hate crowds. You especially hate ceremonies. Your text said: green beans, thirteen hundred, corner of Glass Row. This is not green beans.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m not allowed to be surprised by pomp?\u201d His eyes were the color of dark tea. The hair at his temples had gone white in just six months, like a lightning strike did it. \u201cYou\u2019re applying for the keystone tender, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nI blinked. \u201cWho told you that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d he said. \u201cYou told me without telling me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not applying. My unit is. And we\u2019re not winning. They\u2019ll give it to a firm they can shake hands with on the news. We are not... hand-shakable.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could build a mountain out of garbage and call it a temple. Don\u2019t disqualify your hands.\u201d He glanced sidewise, across the floor where aides were still ferrying glass carafes and damp cups and the last of the reporters were packing up their little insect tripods. His gaze snagged on a uniform: slate black, a gorilla\u2019s shoulders, the green thread at the cuff that meant Security Cord wept money and teeth. He released my hand. \u201cYou should see your mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is always such a casual sentence, the way you say it. Like I should see the sun.\u201d\n\nHarun flinched a little, but he nodded. He had flinched ever since the last time my mother and I were in the same room and turned the air into ash with each other. That was three years ago. \u201cShe made fig cakes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t eat fig cakes. I have work.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen just smell them. Pretend you\u2019re eight. Pretend the world doesn\u2019t tick.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cMiren. For me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d he said, and then he smiled, and I knew it was a bad day in a long corridor of bad days, and he was lying to me to keep the hour from falling apart. \u201cI just thought\u2014if we are all learning to stand upright, some of us could stand together again. Before the floor moves.\u201d\n\nI looked past him at the Chancellor. Umboto had left the podium and was swarmed by a little tide of suits and tails. He was laughing, baring those big teeth the color of old parchment, the color of bones. He saw as if his eyes were hands, and everything he touched he made warmer, and nothing ever pulled any of the old ice up from his spine. He had been a prisoner and had bitten his own tongue until he could think without screaming. He had also ordered the purge on the third day of the Red Square. He was a saint, he was a butcher. That was the truth with a capital T you couldn\u2019t say out loud if you wanted to work inside the city\u2019s skin.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go to my mother\u2019s,\u201d I said, and my uncle let out a breath as if I had unscrewed something in him that had been bound too tight.\n\nOn the way out, the Security Cord stopped us. This was not unusual in the building; they stopped everyone; the walls were there to be leaned on. The gorilla wore the kind of bespoke suit that pretends it isn\u2019t armored. He was taller than Harun, which was saying a lot. He was young, but there is a way some of them have of wearing their youth like a uniform you don\u2019t dare mess up.\n\n\u201cEngineer Kash,\u201d he said, looking at me, not at the ID in my lanyard. His iris implants clicked as they focused, and then his nostrils flared a fraction. \u201cThis the uncle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the uncle,\u201d I said, deadpan.\n\nHe smiled, short and humorless. \u201cFunny. I\u2019m Marshal Ketu,\u201d he added, as if I would need it later. Maybe I would. \u201cNext time, your work order gets locked in eight hours in advance. No repairs during addresses.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe podium was hungry for a wrench,\u201d I said. \u201cI brought food.\u201d\n\nKetu\u2019s yellow-orange eyes did not blink. Behind him, the bonobo aide from the stage past clutched a folio against his chest like it would keep his heart in place. Ketu glanced at me, then at my uncle\u2019s face as if to measure whether we were the right kind of together. He moved aside. \u201cCrown keep you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you,\u201d Harun said.\n\nI caught the gorilla\u2019s gaze as we stepped past him. My mother had said once that a long time ago if an ape looked at you that way you dropped your eyes because you knew what you were; you knew your body did not win that argument. \u201cIs the Chancellor\u2019s speech always going to make all our vents cry?\u201d I asked.\n\nKetu\u2019s mouth quirched. He had a scar that cut his upper lip, a thin white ladder. \u201cOnly when the screws are human.\u201d\n\nOutside, the city had been washed for the day. It was a ritual and a security habit: the drones sprayed and squeegeed the glass ribs and the kinetics skimmed the residual proteins off the fountains. The day glowed soft as bread. People moved like schools of sardines along the mid-walks; black banners with the Chancellor\u2019s motto snapped and sagged, snapped again; on the low buskers\u2019 shelf a trio of orangutans, children really, practiced a violin piece, fingers so precise you forgot the hands that belonged to them.\n\nHarun and I walked down the different. He smelled like cloves, always, even when he forgot to brush his hair. We passed a kiosk that sold insects fried in honey oil. A man with scars on both cheeks kissed the last piece in a packet before he ate it. I can\u2019t explain why that image stayed, but it did. We crossed a sunstripe of warmth. We took the stairs to Glass Row because the lifts would be full. Somewhere above us, a choir sang the old human song about morning on the river. They sang it so carefully you could tell they were being watched.\n\nAt my mother\u2019s door, Harun straightened his jacket. He knocked the way he always did: three soft, then one hard, like a joke inside a warning. We heard pots clump, then silence, then the scrape of a chair, then her footfalls, then for some reason my heart beat against my chest like I\u2019d run. When she opened the door, nothing was wrong except that everything that had ever been wrong lived in the way she stood there holding the edge of the door like she might bite it off.\n\n\u201cMa,\u201d I said, and my mouth shaped it like a soft stone I had carried for a long time. \u201cWe\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI made fig cakes,\u201d she said, as if it had been her idea to invite us, and she turned and walked back into the apartment.\n\nI could have left then. I didn\u2019t. Harun followed me in and closed the door gently with a closeness of fingers I had inherited. He mouthed: thank you. I rolled my eyes.\n\nMy mother\u2019s place smelled like cardamom and boiled milk and the disinfectant that the clinic gave out for free. On the shelf above the cooking unit sat the collection of mugs nobody ever used except guests, the way poor people define ceremony. The window was open the tiniest bit to let the heat out. On the sill, a plant tried to stay alive by sheer will. My mother moved between skillet and board with the grace of someone who had grown a city out of dried beans. She pretended not to look at me. I pretended not to look at the way her shoulder hurt.\n\nFor five minutes we talked about canning. New lids were hard to come by. Old lids played at being new and gave you botulism. The apes had no use for canned bean paste but they had made a rule about how many lids could be in a household at once because rules breed rules. Harun told a story about a man who had used a pressure cooker as a drum and blew off his eyebrows and started a band. We touched our cups to the table. We sipped tea that was too hot to sip. The world stayed in joint one second at a time because there were rituals and small stupid lies.\n\nIt was my mother who broke the seal. She set a plate of fig cakes on the table. They were ugly and perfect, the way a fruit that does not care about human aesthetics is perfect. \u201cThey say the Cord will replace the district medics,\u201d she said to Harun without looking at him. \u201cThey say we will go to the barracks for stitches.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey say many things,\u201d Harun said. \u201cThey said my teeth would never be straight.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mother did that with string.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd a prayer. I move my mouth the way she told me to still.\u201d He bit a fig cake. \u201cMa. Let the rumors be rumors until they are walls.\u201d\n\nShe made a noise that could have been agreement or contempt. \u201cI saw him on the screen. The Chancellor. He has soft eyes. I don\u2019t trust soft eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is because you have sharp ones,\u201d Harun said, and she did not laugh, but she liked that he said it, you could see the liking go down her throat like a good tea.\n\nI ate half a fig cake to show my body it was still on my side. I looked out the window. A boy on a delivery scooter flew past so close he could have landed in her sink. Somewhere in the building a baby cried and then stopped, mid-sob, as if the person who held it had said an effective word. \u201cMa,\u201d I said, because I could feel the coil inside the silence that came now, and I had to cut it before it cut me. \u201cI have a chance to work up-tier on the keystone tender. If we get a foot in, if we just\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will not turn bolts for animals to climb out of the pit they put us in,\u201d she said, and it was the pit we both had inside us that spoke. It was also the pit in the ground where the first city had begun. \u201cYou will not give them a better stadium from which to watch us dance.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a water control lattice, not a stadium.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lattice is a fence,\u201d she said, precise, and she had been a word-precise woman before the Revolution threw its vocabulary at her head. She looked at me. It was like looking into a mirror and seeing Deeper Being looking back. \u201cDo you remember, Miren, who dropped money on your science class? Do you remember who was turned back from the market on Mondays? I do. I remember when your father still sang. Do you think the gorillas will bring that back? Do your keystones hold that kind of weight?\u201d\n\nHarun stirred like he could pull that question off the table. \u201cSosie. Let her.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet her what,\u201d she said. \u201cLet her be eaten alive slowly. We are not food.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to fight,\u201d I heard my mouth say, and it was a lie. \u201cI came to tell you. If we get the tender, I\u2019ll be up there some days of the week. You\u2019ll get a higher queue number because you\u2019re attached to my badge. I can make sure the clinic gets more kits. I can\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think I want the little gifts you took from the palace,\u201d she said in a voice that did not belong to the way she poured water for us when we were small. \u201cYou think I want my daughter to make herself a knot in the net they throw over the whole city. What will you untangle when they are done tying you.\u201d\n\n\u201cMa,\u201d Harun said gently. \u201cYour metaphors are very strong and we have tea getting cold.\u201d\n\nWe were saved by the door knock. It was that weird authoritarian knock like firmness in a suit, except it came three times and stopped and didn\u2019t announce itself again. Harun and I both heard it. My mother didn\u2019t move. She gave me a look like a coin.\n\nI got up. I opened the door. There was nobody in the hall. There was, however, a package the size of a grapefruit wrapped in waxed cloth with a string knotted in a silly bow. There was a card stuck in the knot. It was my name in wrong handwriting.\n\nI brought it in. Harun\u2019s face changed. He stood up. \u201cWho was it,\u201d he said, but he did not mean that question because there had not been a who. He had the same habit I did: making words because otherwise silence made your hands shake.\n\nI pulled the card free. Miren, the card said, and below that a single line of printed letters in the neat block of a machine: when you remember this, remember me.\n\nMy mother pursed her mouth. She had a drawer in her kitchen for mysteries. It held a green ribbon from an election, a tiny doll a child left on their doorstep, two buttons from a jacket she didn\u2019t own. \u201cDo not open that.\u201d\n\nI would have been more obedient if she had said please. I unknotted the string. The waxed cloth peeled back. It wasn\u2019t a grapefruit. It was a hinge, an old one, heavy black iron folded over itself. It had three holes for screws and one hole for something else. It had been rubbed with oil that smelled like a ghost of vinegar. It had been used for many years and then tucked away carefully, cleaned and made to remember a use it would never have again.\n\nHarun made a noise, sharp as a laugh, but not a laugh. He reached for it and stopped his hand as if he saw a field of bees around it. \u201cWhere did you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was at the door,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI can see that,\u201d he said, and now we were back in our normal, good humors, except my mother\u2019s face. She had gone pale around the eyes, a paleness that meant the memory under the memory under the ritual had opened its mouth. \u201cThat hinge,\u201d he said, and he sat down as if a weight had been placed on his shoulders and he could not buck it off. \u201cThat hinge was from Red Stairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are being dramatic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am being accurate,\u201d he said. \u201cThat hinge held a door that held a room that held something that the Cord would like very much not to talk about.\u201d\n\nMy mother stood up so fast her chair fell. She did not pick it up. \u201cYou will both leave,\u201d she said, and the way she said it meant it was the only way memory could keep her lungs working. \u201cTake your hinge. Go.\u201d\n\n\u201cMa,\u201d I said, but Harun was already on his feet, the hinge in his hands now, astonished by its weight.\n\n\u201cShe is right,\u201d he said to me, without looking away from my mother because the two of them could pull entire trains with their gaze when they wanted to. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving. Sosie. Thank you. I\u2019ll bring her back later. Or I won\u2019t. It was good to smell your tea.\u201d\n\nWe left. We could have stayed and argued and broken our bones on the usual rocks. We left. In the hallway, Harun breathed out, then in, and only then, weirdly, he laughed. \u201cHinges,\u201d he said, to the air. \u201cThey think they\u2019re being subtle. They always do this, they\u2019re always making a game of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cPeople who write notes and pretend they don\u2019t know you were going to open them anyway.\u201d His hand shook. The hinge made no sound when it rocked. \u201cI told you the floor was going to move. Miren. I need to show you something. No. I need to say something and I need you to listen without talking until I am done. Do you think you can do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cTry.\u201d\n\nWe went down two flights and across to a service stair nobody used except the maintenance crew and the very tired. It smelled like old rain. Harun sat on the step and set the hinge down next to his shoe like a dog. He looked at his hands. Then he looked at me.\n\n\u201cThere are things we keep in days,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there are things we keep in bodies. There are things we keep in cities. Sometimes a city learns how to keep secrets the way a body does, by building a skin around them and feeding them.\r\n\n\u201cThere is a thing in this city, Miren\u2014a piece of code and a piece of prayer, married, that we built when we were losing and thought we had lost everything. I say we as if I were the one with the original idea but I was a carrier. I carried it behind my teeth for thirty months. When the purge was done, we needed a way to make sure the next purge never happened. So we wrote a lock.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the lock the Chancellor can\u2019t open if the people he\u2019s about to poison don\u2019t speak the word. It\u2019s the lock that makes the vents breathe in and not out. It\u2019s the lock the Red Stairs boys died to nest inside the keystone. It\u2019s the lock that holds the valve that holds the perfect storm. I am being confusing. I know. I am making words walk down a thin bridge and not fall. Forgive me.\u201d\n\n\u201cPut... why are you telling me this.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause,\u201d he said, and now he laughed again, a horrible laugh like a cough. \u201cBecause they put it in me. And they left a map of it in hinges and fig seeds and songs that only your mother still knows by heart. Because when I die, the lock breaks unless someone who understands how to use both a wrench and a mouthbody eats\u201d\u2014he flinched as he said it, his eyes went away from me then back because he couldn\u2019t not look\u2014\u201cwhat the lock is stored in. Do you understand me.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t. That is, my mind understood the words and the pictures they painted, little cartoons of absurdity. The truth, that lived lower, did not accept that its job would ever require teeth.\n\n\u201cTell me you are lying,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI would never lie to you,\u201d he said immediately, and it was so quick and clean that I believed him and I hated him with love for it.\n\n\u201cYou would lie to me a thousand times if it kept me in one piece,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he admitted, and he smiled a little, the way a sailor might smile as he throws up, because he knows land exists and he does not know he will see it again. \u201cBut not this time. You told me once you wanted to be an engineer because the world made sense as soon as you understood where the forces traveled. I am telling you where they travel. I am telling you that the Chancellor\u2019s pretty keystone is a trap we built for somebody worse with his face but not his hands.\u201d He touched the hinge. \u201cIt\u2019s a lock that has to know the person who opens it is family. That knowledge lives in the gut. That was the choice we made when we were animals trying to become human again.\u201d\n\nMy skin went hot and cold and hot again like water with a mind. I put my head in my hands. I laughed, small and ugly and mean. \u201cThat is absurd.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is. Imagine. I signed off on it. I used a false name but it was still my signature. It was that or building a god we could never turn off. We did both, really.\u201d He squeezed his eyes shut. \u201cI have been telling myself I could keep you away from this. That I could\u2014if I kept my hands clean and stopped seeing you at the clinic and never came to your mother\u2019s door again and aged correctly\u2014 then this would happen after and without you. But they sent the hinge. That means they think I flinch. That means they think sending you a toy will push me into the street. They are not wrong. I run on metaphor like a clock. I am a man made of hinges. You are too. I am sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t... I can build a new lock. With numbers. With a password that is not a\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey kill numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey always do. You can see it. They kill numbers and call it security. There is a reason we chose meat. Meat is complicated in a way they will never be comfortable with.\u201d\n\nI thought about the Chancellor\u2019s knuckles on the wood. I thought about the baby down the hall. I thought about my mother\u2019s face when she saw the hinge. I thought about Marshal Ketu\u2019s mouth when he said only when the screws are human.\n\n\u201cYou even know if it works,\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWe tested it,\u201d he said. A shadow moved through his expression like a big fish. \u201cOn the worst day I ever had. It did. It does. It will. If we get to the moment and there is no mouth that can say the word that is both word and oxygen, then the city will breathe in, and everything scarce will stay where scarce hides. If we get to the moment and there is you, then\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I will have eaten my own uncle,\u201d I said, somehow like a joke, because sometimes the only way to put a thing in the skin is to put more iron in your voice than your blood. \u201cIn order to say a word to a machine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will make sure you hate me by then,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it will not be so\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cStop.\u201d I stood up. I had been sitting on the cold step like I had nowhere else. I had a thousand elsewheres. None of them were real. \u201cStop talking like you know arithmetic for this. You don\u2019t. Nobody does.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just decided on a sum. We hope the answer doesn\u2019t end us.\u201d He looked up at me and his hand twitched like he wanted to touch my shoe for balance. He didn\u2019t. \u201cYou see why we should never have built keystones in the first place, by the way. The city should be a thousand little mistakes you can fix with string.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big one with flags.\u201d I was breathing too much. I was not breathing enough. I was in and then out of my body like a tourist. \u201cWhy now. Why the hinge now. If the lock is sleeping, if the city isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re rearranging the angels,\u201d Harun said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I got a whisper at market this morning. The Cord is moving engineers. The Chancellor is moving the Chancellor. There is someone among the apes who wants to be king of the ghosts. In that shuffle, somebody remembered we exist.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think I can handle this.\u201d It was not a question I meant to ask.\n\n\u201cI know you can,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I wish I didn\u2019t. It makes me feel like a terrible person.\u201d\n\nI sat again because my knees decided that argument. Harun lifted the hinge into his lap. He stroked it with a thumb, the way you touch a dog to calm yourself down. We sat like that, two scraps of bone in a stairwell, until voices scuffed above our heads again and a child cried somewhere and then I laughed once more because it is ridiculous that a stairwell can hold both this particular apocalypse and some delivery guy\u2019s need to pee.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, after a space, and my voice sounded like someone had poured gravel into it and then put it through a sieve. \u201cSay you die. Say I\u2014say I do what you want like I have ever done what anybody\u2014 fine. Say somehow. Then what? I go where? I say what? Do I write it down,\u201d and the laugh slipped out from under the words, \u201cBecause I am a good student? You have a manual.\u201d\n\nHe patted his jacket. He took out a folded square of soft, filthy paper that I recognized before he unfolded it and my heart forgot what to do. It was the diagram he had drawn for me when I was twelve of a water cycle with little arrows and pictures of clouds and a ridiculously smug sun. He had added to it, one small neat drawing at a time, with a pen so fine it made you think it wasn\u2019t real. There were, now, not only clouds and rain but vents and sparger valves and a little man with a wrench that looked suspiciously like me standing on a grate.\n\n\u201cGods,\u201d I said, because sometimes that is the right language. \u201cYou hid a poem under my homework.\u201d\n\nHe put the diagram on his knee and tapped one corner. \u201cGo here when I tell you,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kind of here that moves. You\u2019ll get a call. You will hate the person who calls. They will laugh at you. Keep them on the line. They will tell you how to get to the bone. Listen for the word cline. Do not send a message to your mother. She will know anyway. Put pebbles in your pocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy pebbles.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you remember that your body holds eleven kilograms of stone at any given time,\u201d he said, absolutely straight-faced. \u201cIt helps.\u201d Then he smiled, just with the corner of his mouth. \u201cNo. Because the alarms think pebbles are interesting and they look away from flesh when the bags jingle. It\u2019s stupid but it works. People build machines like they are afraid of coins.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to go,\u201d I said, standing again and realizing I couldn\u2019t feel my feet. \u201cI have to go to work. We have a real pressure jump. If I don\u2019t go, someone drowns. If I go, maybe I drown later. Why is the world made of this kind of math.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause God was an engineer but not a very good one,\u201d Harun said mildly, standing too, folding the diagram back into its pretend-childhood and tucking it into his heart-pocket. \u201cBecause we are apes. Because we made our own gods and some of them want to be sturdy and some of them want to be adored. Go.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome by later,\u201d I said. \u201cFor the beans. I\u2019ll make a stew that fights back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will try,\u201d he said. He patted the hinge. He picked it up and tucked it under his arm like a ridiculous, heavy book. \u201cYou know, you were five when you first asked me if hinges were what made the doors when doors opened, or if it was the space in between that did it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was a very annoying child.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a very annoying uncle,\u201d he said, and then his voice went very, very simple: \u201cMiren.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said, and I looked at him because I had to. He was only himself in the way that a person who has made his body into a container for other people\u2019s nonsense can be himself. He was still my uncle, with the neat way he parted his hair and his stupid love for card tricks and his soft spot for cats that made him leave tuna on his window sill even though the cats were machinelike demons that screamed at dawn, that.\n\nHe put his free hand on my shoulder. He leaned his head to the side a little like he wanted to listen to my breath. \u201cRemember that you know how to build. Remember that when you are eating grief.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop with the language,\u201d I said, because it hurt. \u201cJust\u2014 text me when you get home. And don\u2019t go anywhere stupid.\u201d\n\nHe saluted with the hinge. \u201cToo late,\u201d he said, and his grin then was real, the one that made his eyes go crooked. I almost laughed again. Then he pretended to stride off toward the lifts with the hinge like a marching band instrument. I watched him go until the stairwell\u2019s corners took him. Then I was alone with the old rain smell. Then I went to work.\n\nFenn met me at the basin and handed me a coffee I didn\u2019t ask for. The basin had a fresh set of hairline cracks like a spider had made a glass home. The pressure numbers sulked like misbehaving children. We stood thigh-deep in the noise of water pretending to be solid. Fenn\u2019s mouth was set. The tiny scar at her temple from when she walked into a machine guard without looking stood out white. She was the only person I could say everything to and trust it would not fall out of her like a drawer cracked open. I didn\u2019t say everything. I said: \u201cMy mother made fig cakes.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell her I said they were rude.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the Chancellor,\u201d she said, because she liked to collect every piece of a day and put it on a table. \u201cHe said he was learning to stand upright. Imagine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey always do that,\u201d I said. \u201cThey rehearse a fall.\u201d\n\nShe glanced at me. \u201cWhat happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy uncle handed me an apocalypse in a stairwell.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d she said, and she tipped her head to one side in that way she had when I gave her one of my sentences. \u201cBig day.\u201d\n\n\u201cBig day.\u201d I knelt near the long crack and pressed three fingers against the cool. \u201cYou feel that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll sleeve it. And I\u2019ll sleep on it. And if it moves, they will kill numbers.\u201d\n\nShe blew out a breath. \u201cYou are speaking clockwork again. You want me to get the good seal or the expensive seal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the same.\u201d I wept a little as I laughed, because some days the city gives you a pun and you have to use it or you\u2019ll never get a better one. \u201cFenn. Do you ever\u2014 how long do you think any of this is going to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019re in your head,\u201d she said gently, and she set her machine box down and stood at my side. She tucked a strand of hair behind my ear with a dirty knuckle. We are not lovers. We are not anything people can measure. She is one of the ropes that keep me from falling off the ship. \u201cWe fix, Miren. It is our glorious curse. That is all. If none of this lasts, they can bury us with beautiful wrenches.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to be buried with a stupid hinge,\u201d I said, and that made my rib cage feel like a bad instrument again. Fenn put her shoulder against mine so that if I leaned, my body would not ask the floor to catch me.\n\nWe worked. The water made its machine song. Somebody\u2019s child in another unit sang along. At one point my phone hissed and showed me a text from an unknown number with one word, lunch?, and my skin crawled because I am not brave; my body wants soft things always, and coded messages make my feet cold. I put the phone face-down. I held a sleeve in place while Fenn glued it to the world. I thought of Harun with the hinge under his arm like a clumsy instrument, walking into the light like a fool. I thought of Marshal Ketu whose scar was a line, who would find me if I made the wrong shadow. I smelled figs in my hair, cardamom on my clothes, the AC\u2019s faint metallic.  \n\nAt shift end, the basin held. We marked a calendar. We put away our tools like soldiers or like mothers. Fenn bumped my hip with her hip. \u201cStew that fights back,\u201d she said. \u201cInvite me.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d I said. \u201cBring an instrument that isn\u2019t a hinge.\u201d\n\nShe laughed. Then she put two fingers to my wrist and felt my pulse like a medic. \u201cHe\u2019ll text,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s too vain not to.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s late.\u201d The clock said six. The clock said the day had gotten on the shuttle he wasn\u2019t supposed to take. I kept the phone facedown like it could poison me.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a man,\u201d she said, like that explained tardiness at an atomic level. \u201cGo home. Eat something. If you stare at a door, it does not open faster.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes it does,\u201d I said, my voice so thin it could have cut bread. \u201cSometimes the hinges\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cEnough with the\u2014 go.\u201d She kissed my cheek like a cousin and shoved me toward the ladders. \u201cText me when you turn the key.\u201d\n\nI walked home. Night had gummed its thumbprint along the edges of the buildings. The big hum of the upper-tier crawled down, a contented purr of machines which had eaten all the food and lay on their backs. I passed three men playing a game with chalk circles on the concrete and an empty bottle. The bottle made a good coyote of luck. A little boy threw water off a balcony and laughed when it turned to mist and blew back in his face. Someone cried. Someone sang the bad ape song about mangoes. Someone argued about an old election. All the heavy things and the light things of this city walked down the same street with me and didn\u2019t ask my name. Once, I glanced up at the sky and saw the faint line a lift leaves in the air when it is clean. I almost smiled. The world is rude and beautiful and built of angles that can hold a palm.\n\nMy door was the same green it had always been. My lock was keyed to my hand\u2019s pressure and my breathing rhythm, because I am paranoid and good with little machines. The door opened. The place smelled like copper and spun sugar because I had left a spool on the table and the spool was a liar. The plant in my window was dead. I had pretended for a week it was sleeping. I touched its leaf with one finger and said, \u201csorry, friend,\u201d because I am the kind of person who thanks the leaf she killed. It kept still. I went to the kitchen. I put the pot on for the stew that fights back. I cleaned a knife. I sat down with my phone. The phone did not have any messages from Uncle Harun.\n\nIt had a new text from an unknown number, exactly one word again: cline.\n\nI put the knife down carefully. I wanted to put it down so hard it made a sound. I wanted to look like the kind of person who could pick up her own uncle with her mouth and not die. I picked up the phone. I typed: wrong number, because I am bad at comedy under pressure. The phone spit back a map. The map\u2019s flight path showed me three routes through the city I had traveled only in dreams: underflesh roads and old service train skeletons and stairs that the developers had lined with fake cherry trees and then bricked over when someone died under them. It put a little red dot where I was. It put a little violet star where it wanted to see me. I stared at it until the pot hissed. I turned the gas off.\n\nI typed: who dis.\n\nThe response took six seconds. That\u2019s forever. The forever said: someone laughing. do me a favor, put pebbles in your pockets. have you eaten. bring water.\n\nI wanted to be brave. I wanted to be the person who didn\u2019t say okay to jokes with razors in them. I typed: I have pebbles. Somehow. By accident. I typed: I have not eaten. I typed: If you hurt him, I will hit you with a hinge.\n\nA smile appeared as dots. Then: i believe you. now run.\n\nI put the phone in my pocket. I put three small nails in my other pocket because I did not own pebbles. I put a bottle of water in my bag and a wrench I didn\u2019t need but I am never without wrench. I turned off the light. I turned it on again. I turned it off again. I locked the door and tested it twice. Then I was a person on a stairwell moving toward a violet star in a city that had learned how to whisper with its vents.\n\nOn the second-floor landing, I almost ran over Marshal Ketu. He was leaning against the wall with the ease of someone who had decided gravity was a friend. He stepped away from the plaster and it took on his shape before it forgave him for pressing. He looked tired in the way good soldiers look tired when a day has been long and the orders have changed.\n\n\u201cEvening,\u201d he said, softly, as if he knew there was a sleeping child behind one of these doors and he would not wake that child for any reason except the end of the world. He cleared his throat and the throatboard picked it up and it sounded like a big jar emptying. \u201cFunny thing. I was just about to knock.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any cookies,\u201d I said, and I was surprised that I sounded like me. That was good. Or not. I tucked my hands into my jacket pockets so he wouldn\u2019t see the nails. That\u2019s a lunatic sentence.\n\n\u201cWe arrested a man two hours ago,\u201d Ketu said. He looked at his hands, then back at my face. He took a breath. For the first time since I\u2019d met him, he looked uncertain. \u201cThis city has a way of giving me the wrong sensibilities. I was trained to think a certain way. The city wants me to think like a river.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you going to search my pockets for pebbles,\u201d I asked because sometimes you poke the bear to make sure it is a bear and not a bad dream.\n\nKetu\u2019s eyes flicked. He smiled, tight. \u201cI should take you in,\u201d he said, and I couldn\u2019t tell if he believed himself. \u201cOr I should warn you. Or I should ask you if you\u2019ve eaten.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not use my lines,\u201d I said, and to my own shock, he laughed.\n\n\u201cRed Stairs was always so dismissive of authority,\u201d he said, very mild. \u201cTell me, engineer. Do you think the Chancellor has soft eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he has hard ones he covers with soft ones. I think you know that. I think I have somewhere to be and you are at my door at the exact moment you shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d\n\nA voice behind one of the doors coughed. Ketu\u2019s head tilted so he could track it the way a cat\u2019s does. When he looked back at me, he had made a decision. \u201cKeep him alive,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWho,\u201d I said, playing the fool.\n\n\u201cYour uncle,\u201d he said, as if there was no point being coy between us because the city was listening and the city liked a straight story. \u201cKeep him alive as long as you can.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if I can\u2019t,\u201d I said, because I wanted him to have to own the sentence that followed.\n\n\u201cThen do what the lock wants,\u201d he said. His eyes were tired again. He rubbed his lip where the scar was. \u201cI will deny all of this,\u201d he added, for himself. For the gods. \u201cAnd if you tell your mother I stood in your hallway, she will find me in the street and make me cry.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe will,\u201d I said, honestly. \u201cShe keeps a drawer.\u201d\n\nHe blinked. He looked at the bottle in my bag. He moved aside. \u201cYou\u2019ve got three minutes before the grid maps catch up to you,\u201d he said, not to me so much as to the air. \u201cI will go the other way. You did not see me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never do,\u201d I said, and that was also true; the Cord used their bodies the way locksmiths use a tumbler: you only sense them when a door clicks. I squeezed past him and took the stairs.\n\nI don\u2019t know what it looked like from up top, the path I took. In my body, it looked like a night punched in little pieces with light. It smelled like old sugar and piss and warm metal and the cheap perfume the kids wear because its bottle has a monkey wearing a crown on it. I stepped where the map in my phone told me to step and sometimes where my feet felt like stepping because maps do not have memories and floors do. When I turned down the long hall under the holy market where they sell dead fish made out of algae and paint them to look like the old fish, a woman with hair like a nest said my name. \u201cMiren,\u201d she said, and her gums showed because her teeth were on a glass somewhere she could not reach. \u201cYour uncle owes me a drip kit.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will bring it,\u201d I said, and that felt like a prayer because I did not know if I believed any of it.\n\nAt the corner where the probate offices used to be, I stepped over a white chalk line and my phone vibrated. The violet star got bigger. The map stopped making sense and then made more sense than any map should, like a diagram of a heart pumping. The door I was supposed to use was not a door. It was a smudge in plaster. I put my fingers on the smudge. It grew into a rectangle. The rectangle took a breath. I pushed. It opened as if it had been waiting for my hands all week. All my life.\n\nInside, it was colder. There was a child\u2019s bicycle with no chain leaned against a pipe and a stack of old posters for a marching band that had never marched and a smell of my father\u2019s last shirt. A man with no hair and a nice mouth waited leaning on a dolly. He was not alone; the room was full of the kind of quiet that means twenty people are listening in the walls. He grinned at me like we had just bumped into each other in a grocery and we both needed oranges.\n\n\u201cFinally,\u201d he said. His voice was the friendliest thing I had heard all day and also the least trustworthy. He did not look like someone who ate breakfast. \u201cYou brought nails. How cute. I said pebbles.\u201d\n\n\u201cNails are pebbles that think,\u201d I said, and I was heartened by the way his grin widened. He liked that. I did, too.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, and he gestured toward a sliver of dark at the back of the room that was not a door either, but it was. \u201cBefore the Cord stops pretending to be polite. They\u2019ve got a new boy in their cage. He thinks he wants to be worse than a Chancellor. He isn\u2019t good enough. That makes him braver.\u201d He started to move the dolly and then didn\u2019t, and he held out his hand to me. It had ink stains on the pads. \u201cI\u2019m Vetch,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cHungry,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd bad at trusting men who introduce themselves as nouns.\u201d\n\n\u201cFair,\u201d he said, and he let his hand drop without making a fuss. \u201cI liked your keystone spec from last year, by the way. You wrote an elegant lie and made it look like physics.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d I said, and I followed him because sometimes you step where the floor asks you to and pray your uncle has left enough breadcrumbs inside your bones to get you through the dark.",

                              "content": "The slit of dark swallowed us the way a drain takes water that has decided not to be a surface anymore. Vetch moved like he owned the angle of the floor and the angle agreed; his cart made a rubber whisper, the kind good machines make to reassure you they will not scream later. My eyes adjusted in stages. The concrete here had been poured with a hand that understood both gravity and art; the aggregate glittered in the beam of the single work light as if the floor had once been a river and still remembered how to hold sunlight in flecks. Pipes ran along the spine of the ceiling, old iron with weld scars that looked like healed mouths, newer composite wrapped in a skin that shivered when you spoke loud, a tangle of copper that someone had braided like hair the day before a wedding. I could taste rust and the ghost of bleach and something else, a fattiness that stuck to the back of the throat the way marrow does when you lick a finger after you\u2019ve pulled bones for soup. It took me three steps to place it. The vents here handled hospital air some days. The city was a body and the lungs had been teaching themselves how to be more than lungs; they had learned how to keep secrets in the alveoli.\n\n\u201cYou redistricted the angels,\u201d I said, because I could see the empty brackets where servo-feet had sat, the scuffed arcs on the concrete from where the wing frames had been dragged. \u201cWe used to run a fan chain down this corridor that would rattle your bones four times a minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did,\u201d Vetch said. He didn\u2019t look over his shoulder. His head had that forward tilt men get when they think they are leading a parade that no one else can see. \u201cThen the Cord decided our feathers were unfashionable. They like ducts that look like the inside of a bank. We still keep a few old wingbones. For sentiment. For leverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeverage is a sentiment now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt always was,\u201d he said, and his grin lived in his voice. \u201cTell me when you feel the cline.\u201d\n\nI did not want to tell him anything because I had a bad habit and did not know how much of me it would cost this time, but my body wanted to be useful. The temperature dipped two degrees at the curve, then snapped up three the length of a breath later, a pressure pocket that made your ears feel like you were remembering a plane ride, a tiny out-gassing of freon kissing my knuckles where they stuck out of the jacket. I put my palm flat to the cinderblock and felt the faint slow pulse of the big system. It was as if the city had a wrist here. \u201cHere,\u201d I said, because the wrist had a vein that sang.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he said. He stopped the dolly with one foot, braced it with a knee, and peeled back the torn corner of a poster that advertised a reunion for a band that had never gotten to the part where you reunite. There was more black behind that. Not a hole. A mouth. Vetch took his inked fingers and pressed three places in sequence the way you soothe a horse when you are about to ask it to behave like a door. \u201cTwice the hard way,\u201d he murmured, which wasn\u2019t to me. The seam unglued itself. Air sighed. My nails in my pocket chimed against one another again and the noise woke up a little bracelet of red lights along the base of the wall, a fox\u2019s eye reflect. \u201cPretty,\u201d Vetch said. \u201cSpread your arms.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, and his grin sharpened.\n\n\u201cYou have hobbies. I have a few. One of them is keeping my lungs inside me when I\u2019m where other people keep their secrets. Arms,\u201d he said, and he held his own out, a show, an invitation, a dare. His wrists were thin, ankles of bird. The ink on his fingers climbed farther than I thought it would; someone had drawn equations there once and the memory of them stained the creases. \u201cLook right, then left. You\u2019ll feel the camera look back. It\u2019s a nervous little thing. It likes coins.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou really trained an alarm on pennies.\u201d I did as he asked because sometimes rebellion is cheap and sometimes it costs you everything, and I had paid enough to stop pretending I didn\u2019t understand this math.\n\n\u201cPennies, bottle caps, pebbles. Things that keep the sound of older economies. We could have built an alarm that calibrates to human cartilage density but then only the people who made it would know how to turn it off when a cat with a bell on its collar ran through. I like cats. I like bells. I don\u2019t like machines that decide to hate me when I have a head cold.\u201d He half-shrugged. The camera\u2019s eye\u2014and it was a camera, but it was also a bead of fluid handling the shape of film memory and light\u2014blinked once. The red went white, then all the lights along the wall softened like butter forgetting it is a square. The mouth opened.\n\nWe stepped into a space that had not been there, except it had always been there and we had just remembered the way your tongue learns to find a tooth with a new crown. It was low enough that you had to bow without making a ritual of it. My shoulder brushed insulation that someone had tucked into fabric; my head bumped a hanger that had once had a bucket and mop hanging from it and now carried something that looked like a bundle of sticks and was not. The more we moved, the more the city\u2019s voice modulated to a pitch I recognized intimately: the song of water neither free nor trapped. Vetch pushed the dolly like he had a date with it later and wanted to leave a good impression. I kept one hand on the wall and let it tell me a story in pulses. We were going down an old service spine, the kind designed by men who wore clip-on ties and thought about the square of nine the way other people think about God. It took two minutes and maybe a lifetime to get to the place where the floor stopped insisting and started begging.\n\nThe bone was named right. It was not white. It was the color of something that had been rubbed by a thousand careful hands, that dull lustre old wood gets when it has been fed oil and sweat, except it was not wood and it was not any kind of bone except in the sense that bones are both structure and a place to store fat when the body has no better pantry. It lay along the floor, half buried in poured concrete like a whale this city had been forced to swallow and had not yet fully digested. Thick cables grew out of it the way hair grows out of auxiliary skin; there were little metal plates on its crown, some new, some stamped with serials from a factory that had burned during the second winter we never call a war. Someone had chalked letters along its length: a math, a prayer, a shopping list. A candle that had been burned down to the stub grinned a perfect wax grin from a bracket; someone had left a hard candy in the dish beside it, a mean little offering, because sugar makes you remember the people who raised you. There were three other people in the room, none of whom stood in the open; their shadows folded themselves as if they had learned origami for survival. One breathed harder than the others. One smelt like tinned fish and mint. The third never once moved; their stillness had a gravity to it that made the hair at my nape sigh.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch it,\u201d Vetch said lightly, which is what you say to a person and a dog and a city when you show them something that you both want and fear at the same time. He set the dolly against the far wall and lifted a tarp that had been pretending to be dirt. Under the tarp, an object lurked that was as obscure as it was obvious: a great drum of old tank metal, the kind they used to store molasses, repurposed and painted with spirals like someone\u2019s grandmother couldn\u2019t help herself. \u201cYou\u2019re going to hate this part. I hated this part the first three times. Then I built a story that made it palatable. You should build one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am told the lock lives in a gut,\u201d I said, and the words went too easily; I had tried to keep them inside my mouth and they had slipped out anyway because my mouth loved telling the truth once it got a taste for it. \u201cI am told the word lives in a mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarun talks,\u201d Vetch said, and finally the friendliness flickered. He flicked his eyes at me and I saw the exact degree to which he would rather not be in a room with the maps he had made until the day they mattered. \u201cYes. It\u2019s gut. It\u2019s mouth. It\u2019s also a bacteria that thought it was a story and a story that thought it was a salt and a salt that learned the shape of grief and laid itself down across a circuit. We invented the word substrate because men like to put something under something else and call it science. This is that, with more rings.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou captured his biome,\u201d I said, choking on the ugliness of it even as my hands twitched curiosity, the way you want to see the cross-section of a engine you hate. \u201cYou sliced him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe volunteered,\u201d Vetch said, perfectly calm and perfectly aware that volunteering is a verb pried out of people by circumstances and goo. \u201cAnd we did not slice him. We nursed his spit, we bribed his bile, we asked the inside of his cheek to tell us where it had slept the night the first lock closed. Then we taught those little animals a song. Then we taught the bone to hum that song back if and only if the mouth that sings it pushes air out in the same pattern that made the lock in the first place. Humans are miraculous. Vents too. Apes as well,\u201d he added, and the drift in his voice said: I am not unaware of who is listening in the walls.\n\n\u201cSing me the song,\u201d I said, and then I had to laugh at myself because that was me trying to be twelve again and ask a man to show me the trick so I could own it, and this was not a trick you own.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t sing,\u201d Vetch said, unhelpfully. He patted the drum. It made a tone like the floor in a cathedral. \u201cBut you\u2019ll taste it.\u201d\n\nThe three shadows separated from their corners the way you peel tape and find it was stuck to itself all along. The one who had smelled like tinned fish offered me a mask. The one with stillness gave Vetch a look that I could not parse and then failed to give me one at all. The third, who breathed like he was always on the lip of a hard run, had hands like mine\u2014calluses in the same geography, one weird scar that mapped to a bolt I recognized on the index finger. He dipped his head to me without pride and I dipped mine back because it felt rude not to say thank you with your neck when people had made a room like this and kept it alive under a city that wanted to forget.\n\n\u201cWe have him,\u201d Vetch said, and because my face went empty the way a screen does when it loses signal and doesn\u2019t want you to know it is afraid, he offered more. \u201cWe had him. We have him again. You can have three iterations of the verb. Language is generous when you are lying to yourself. Harun was taken and we took him back and then we did not entirely leave with him because the Cord has a flair for the dramatic and we have a flair for the practical and sometimes those two flairs meet and mate and produce a ridiculous compromise. He is in a place where he is alive and it makes their ego hurt and our math possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re playing at being oracles,\u201d I said, very flat, because if I let any tone into it I was going to put my fist through the drum and bleed inside out.\n\n\u201cWe are plumbers,\u201d Vetch said. \u201cWith an aesthetics problem. Put the mask on. Then drink. Then breathe when I tell you. Then lean your head in and try not to mind when the bone sneezes.\u201d\n\nIt should have all been theatre. It was theatre. The room was built with care for what a body needs when it is going to do a disgusting, holy thing: there was a steel stool with a pad that had been changed and would be changed again, there was a bucket that was not there to make you feel safe but to be used, there was a tap with water so cold my teeth tried to sing, there was a coil of tubing that had been sterilized and would be sterilized again because someone in this room had lost a child to a stupid needle that had not. I watched the shadows watch me. I sat on the stool. I took the mask because fear needs a prop. I lifted the bottle of water I had brought because I am a good student, then put it down because Vetch gave me a cup that smelled like thyme and iron filings. He had put salt in it, just enough to prep the mouth. He had put sugar too, a slap to the back of the tongue to make the old memory of fig sweet wake up and wag its tail. He watched me swallow as if he could count each muscle\u2019s obedience. He watched me breathe like a medic listens. He nodded once when he believed my air was cooperating. He shifted the tarp again and revealed a pipe fitted to the belly of the bone like a nursing nipple. \u201cYou will not be hurt,\u201d he lied with love. \u201cYou will be changed by the knowledge that you are an animal. That can not be helped.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am an animal,\u201d I said, and I thought of Marshal Ketu\u2019s breath when he said keep him alive, and of my mother\u2019s hands when she set figs on a plate like she was putting little heads in a row to talk to, and of Fenn\u2019s shoulder against mine in the basin. I thought of the young bonobo in his pale jacket telling us a law slow because he knew it would have to carry weight it did not deserve. I put my lips to the pipe and, obedient, as if the floor had asked it, I breathed.\n\nThe bone did not sneeze. It did something worse. It put a thrum in the pipe that matched my pulse and then found the opposite of my pulse like an enemy and sat there, smug and matching. Every time I drew air in, it put out. Every time I tried to let go of air, it sucked, greedily. I was not choking but everything in my head that knows the shape of dying said hello like an old friend with bad intent. The shadows in the room did not move. Vetch\u2019s inked fingers settled on my shoulder bones and did not squeeze. I tasted iron and rain, and under that something like the after of cheap candy, a petroleum ghost that made me want to scrape my tongue on my own teeth. Then\u2014then it happened, the thing I was told would make me hate this less. The taste changed, and it was not taste. It was memory. It did not come from my brain. It came from the place at the back of the mouth where you speak words you have never spoken before and they sound older than your mother.\n\nThere was a street with red stairs. There was a day without cloud. There was a man bending over a boy with a hot bottle and a cool cloth. There was the room where a window had been bricked and then unbricked and the light that came in was the wrong light for that time of day and they all grinned at it anyway like it was a trick done for them by the gods. There was a woman with ink up to the elbow and blood on her knee teaching a machine to listen to a lullaby sung in a language older than the one her mouth had learned to speak after the fourth grade banned the first tongue. There was a hinge on a door. There was a word. The word was not a word. It was a breath turned into wood turned into an instruction set turned into a sound a vent makes when it reverses properly and does not tear the noise out of the lung it loves. I could not tell you what the syllables were because the syllables were not the thing. The ratio was. The ratio put its palm to my chest and said: you are family to those who made me. You are a cousin to the lock. You are a relative by choice and by fault and by the stupid sweetness of the fig your mother taught your mouth to handle when you were four and there was a party and they could not afford cake.\n\nWhen I pulled my mouth away, my hands shook like a bad wire in a not-bad machine. Vetch had a cloth and he wiped my lip because there was a smear there I had not felt happen. He held the cloth up like an exhibit. It had a color on it like no color I have words for because there is a color the inside of a lock makes when it greets the key and that is a thing you should not see if you ever want to sleep again. He smiled at me as if we had been forgiven for breaking a secret. \u201cThere,\u201d he said, and he put the cloth in a bag as lovingly as you put a baby\u2019s tooth in a dish, because this city and this room both loved keeping parts of people in drawers. \u201cYou can come and go. You have the taste. You are the taste. I am sorry,\u201d he added, and he meant it.\n\n\u201cI want to see him,\u201d I said. My voice surrounded the words like putty around a bad window. \u201cNow. If you have him; if you had him; if there is any part of the space between those two statements that can hold my body, take me there.\u201d\n\nVetch did the thing people who think in corners do when a straight line is demanded: he rocked, a little, like his body had ballast and the floor had a wave in it he hadn\u2019t measured for. \u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re moving him again. Or they will. Or they want us to believe they will so we move. You know this dance. You built half the music they\u2019re dancing to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI built vents,\u201d I said. \u201cI built a drain that doesn\u2019t flood the lower stacks when the upper tiers decide to wash their cars in the same hour. I am not a composer of men.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wrote that elegant lie of a spec and I read it,\u201d Vetch said, and the shadow who had held the stillness turned their head just a fraction like a satellite. \u201cYou wrote absolute load numbers you could defend and then carved fifteen percent out of the noise so you would have a panic fund built into the girders when the Chancellor\u2019s budget committee fought you. You wrote a bridge that can flex where they cannot see it flex. Don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know how to build people as systems, Miren. You\u2019re just allergic to calling it that.\u201d He held his hands up when I moved\u2014I did not know whether I had moved to hit him or myself or the bone. \u201cAll right. Compromise. We will let you hear him. You will not go to him. If you go to him now and they take you, they will use you to open us and then we are only meat and sorry thoughts. The hinge was them telling us they know the story. The hinge was your mother\u2019s drawer opening for them. We have to be a new drawer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are very proud of your metaphors,\u201d I said, and the only shape of anger I could find that would not turn me into a knife was contempt made thin. \u201cPut him in my ear.\u201d\n\nVetch did not try to make that pretty. He gestured at the fabric-wrapped insulation I had brushed with my head on the way in, the little bubble of sound that had learned to contain voice instead of heat. He put two fingers to his throat and hummed, and the hummed note traveled up the wall and the wall, obedient, answered with a different note that felt like it happened behind my eyes even though I knew where the speakers were hidden. There was a crackle. There was a breath. There was a coughing laugh. Then there was my uncle, angry and kind, which is to say: himself.\n\n\u201cMiren,\u201d Harun said, and he was holding himself up by sheer invitation. \u201cDo not be a fool.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou first,\u201d I said, and if I had not said that I would have howled like the dog in my bones that had just realized the door was glass. \u201cWhere are you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the place where doors are moral illusions,\u201d he said, and I heard someone else in the near distance chuckle because men like to chuckle when they invent metaphysical jokes in a jail. \u201cI am in between being taken and being held. It is not clever of me. It is not what you would have done. Forgive me. Vetch, stop listening to my niece\u2019s blood move; she is made of it; you will drown.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are on the vent by the grave median,\u201d Vetch said, deadpan, which meant: I care for you, old man, more than I should given that you make my life complicated.\n\n\u201cI am on the vent by the place where the boys used to build kites,\u201d Harun said, which told me the precise corner of the city he meant because that is how the city organizes itself when you are from here; there is the map with names and then there is the map with boys and kites and women with red hair who cried on Tuesdays and the corner where a bicycle was chained for a decade to a pipe and you watched it go from bike to sculpture to ghost. \u201cThe Cord is watching me exactly enough to hurt us later. There is a boy with an ambition the size of the space his father left in his mouth when he knocked his back teeth out. He is making them very brave. They will make a mistake. You will take advantage. The lock will not have to eat anyone today if you can do two things for me, Miren.\u201d\n\n\u201cName them,\u201d I said, because my body was hot all over like fever but the part of me that had fallen in love with specific instructions was cool and grateful and hideous in its gratitude.\n\n\u201cTurn the angels\u2019 shoulders,\u201d he said. \u201cThey moved them. Move them again. The pressure does not care who wears a suit. It cares about angles and the lies you tell when you pretend thirty degrees is close enough to forty-five if you smile at it. You know the corridor where the sky pretends to look down because the glass is angled just so for the cameras. Stand under the sixth rib. Tell it to stop making love to the wind. Tell it to hold its juice. It will not listen to Vetch because it made up its mind about the timbre of his voice when he sang a bad song in a good room. It will listen to you because you talk to metal like it can be forgiven. The second thing is uglier. You will not like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not like the first,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou loved the first,\u201d he said, and he coughed again but the laugh in the cough was a knife used to cut honesty into correct sizes. \u201cThe second is this: tell your mother you did not come to my door when she told you to go. Tell her you chose to leave. She will hurt. She will hate. The city will use her to hurt us if you let it. Make her small for a minute. Save her. I know,\u201d he added, and the wall cannot carry a hand on your hair but he almost managed it, \u201cI am asking you to pick between two kinds of grief. I am sorry. Pick the one that keeps a mouth alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are asking me to be brave in a room where I cannot see the edge,\u201d I said, and the old anger that was also love rose in me like steam. \u201cI hate you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you,\u201d he said, and he meant that sentence in the way a man who is about to do something unforgivable likes to say it. \u201cNow go be an engineer. Vetch, feed her. She gets stupid when the salts go. I will call when the boy with the hole in his teeth makes his mistake, and if they decide not to make it, we will make one for them. Kiss your mother for me if she will let you.\u201d\n\nThe line clicked off. The wall remembered it was insulation. For a moment the bone hummed like a thing that had eaten and was satisfied for half a second. Vetch handed me the cup again and for once did not say anything clever. He watched me swallow and watched my hands find the spanner in my bag and watched me put the nails in my other pocket where I could reach them without thinking. He nodded again at the bone, reverent and practical and a little sick to his stomach because he was a man whether he liked it or not. \u201cYou heard the parade,\u201d he said. \u201cRun ahead of it.\u201d\n\nWe came out of that room faster than we had gone in. The camera liked my nails and told the alarms a little story that kept them occupied. The mouth in the wall sighed shut behind us and pretended to be a poster again. The corridor outside felt warmer because I had a job and living becomes doable when you can put your hand on a knob and make it obey. Vetch did not try to walk with me this time. He tucked his inked hands into his sleeves and gave me a look that men give to women they cannot afford to play hero with: respect that has been stripped of its testosterone. The shadows did not follow us though one of them slid along beside the wall like humidity.\n\n\u201cDo not die for theatre,\u201d he said at the threshold.\n\n\u201cIf I die, make it look like a plumbing accident,\u201d I said. \u201cIt would be funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will make it beautiful,\u201d he said, because he was vain enough to want to be the one to write my epitaph even if he hated half of me for breathing his air. Then he was gone and the city\u2019s broader noise took hold again like a hand on the back of the neck.\n\nThere are places where the city pretends to be empty. There are chairs no one ever sits on under lamps meant for different weather. There is a square where we planted a tree that died every year and we replaced it and finally someone realized the sum of those deaths was a better ritual than a living tree would have been. The sixth rib of the atrium\u2019s east flank was not in a place anyone but us looked at; it sat above the seam where the market\u2019s billboards stopped arguing with each other and in that lull the engineering had gotten away with a fix that made a sound you would only hear if you had learned to love the noises machines produce when they are telling you their truth. I took the stairs two at a time and then realized I was not twenty anymore and my thighs made an unpleasant argument the whole way up. The teams on duty did not look at me when I passed because you can pretend you don\u2019t know something if you don\u2019t look it in the face. The camera at the threshold winked at my nails as if we were old friends. The sixth rib lay where it had always lay, smug because it belonged to a shape people loved and would not allow to be ugly.\n\nIt is hard to explain to a person who has never had to talk to a joint how it is like convincing a mule to cross a stream. There is no argument. There is the weight of your body placed correctly and the pressure of your palm behaving like a promise. There is the way you let your breath out at the exact moment the hinge decides it could be persuaded by love instead of force. There is a murder you do not commit because you have remembered to move before killing becomes the only language a machine will hear. I put my hand on the rib and I apologized for what men in suits had done to its shoulders, and then I whispered to the angels and asked them if they would mind folding a little different tonight because there were children under here who would appreciate a dry bed. The rib did not have ears but it had temperature and pressure and an achy place that had been down-hinged too far for too long. I found the bolt that hid under the gasket. I turned it a quarter. I listened, right cheek to metal. The world shifted like a great animal reconfiguring its sleep in the straw and deciding on a different side. Far below, a vent coughed and then pulled a breath in with a will. The whine that had haunted the west gutter closed like a mouth that had been forced to open too wide. I could feel in my teeth the gate at the grave median test itself and then tolerate its own correctness. Good. One thing. A screw you could turn. The kind of victory my mother hated because it made me high.\n\nBelow me the market was doing its night dance. Women in coats like vertical fields walked under light. A baby howled once and then forgot what anger was for thirty seconds. An ape in a jacket with sleeves so tight his shoulders made a joke of fashion touched the top of a kiosk and let his fingers linger on the glass the way a man who did not touch often might touch a surface just to remind his body what skin was. Marshal Ketu\u2019s shadow passed over the far mezzanine and I knew him even in silhouette because scars make a posture you carry even when you try not to. He did not look up. He had told me to keep my uncle alive as long as I could and then to be meat for a machine if I could not. I had done the first thing he asked without breaking. I had already put my mouth on the road to the second.\n\nMy phone hummed against the bone of my thigh like a small domesticated animal eager to show me the trouble it had found. It was not a number I knew and it was the number I had been waiting for like a bad student waits for a grade. The word was not a word. It was a clatter of punctuation that meant: now. The map bloomed in the air and then I made it not bloom because the city has eyes and I have learned to be a person two steps away from being under glass. I tucked the phone into my pocket. I was about to step down when the world changed gears, the way a good bicycle does when you find the right hill to make it behave. Something in the east shook and stopped pretending to be obedient. Alarms began in the far distance and then nearer. The Cord loved a siren the way children love sour candy. The sirens did not sound like appetite. They sounded like humiliation sharpened into duty. The boy with the hole where the teeth should be had done his brave thing. It was time to answer.\n\nI ran the quick way through the back of the market, under the awnings where someone had spent real money to make the rain sound nice and then complained when it did what rain does and made everything inconvenient. The map took me not to a vent, not to a door that remembered me, but to a piece of sculpture a student had welded out of regret and bicycle rims during the second year of the Chancellor\u2019s rule because we had all thought making art in public was a safer way to rebel than making bombs, and nobody had told the student that both weapons required a similar appetite for shame. The sculpture had been meant to look like a fish or a hand or a promise; it looked like a failure that would cut you if you got too close. I got close. The nails chimed. The base had a panel that someone had installed with more force than love. I pried it. There was a space behind it that could hold a human and a human\u2019s poor decisions. I had both. I crawled in, counted the burrs as they caught my jacket and then released me like someone had been nice enough to clip them down the day before. I hit my knee on something important and my knee screamed and then said sorry because it knew I was doing my best. Then I was in a pipe next to a pipe next to a shaft that said: if you fall, this will be the last teaching this city offers you.\n\nVoices moved along the shaft, a dozen floors away and one breath to my left. The map wanted me to move fast. My body wanted me to be quiet. I did both, a ridiculous compromise, because people are dumb angels when we think speed will save us from math. I took a left where the smell of old coffee said left, a right where a patch of damp said the janitors had stopped caring the day the pay changed, a third right because the pipe bent that way and pipes are conservative and it is good to be polite to conservatives when you need them. There was a bar of light ahead that meant a grate. I wanted to reach it and huddle under it like a rat. I wanted to avoid it because light is a narcotic and the Cord projects their authority in shadow. I belly-crawled and swore at the past version of me who had put on a belt this morning like a functional adult. I stopped with my nose a centimeter from the grate and let my eyes go up out of my head like a periscope.\n\nWe were at the edge of the grave median. The place where the boys used to fly kites lay empty not because no one loved it but because it was the kind of emptiness you pay to maintain. There were flags along the low wall that had always been tasteful because someone had decided human mourning needed a graphic designer. Under the sixth rib\u2019s shadow\u2014my rib, mine for the minute because I had told it to behave and it had listened\u2014the Cord had set up a false tent, the kind of canvas that pretends it is cotton because it wants to smell like sincerity but has a spine of carbon that can hold a conversation with bullets. The tent had a table. The table had a man. The man had a face I knew and eyes that pretended I did not exist. He had been my uncle and he was again and would be again if the city's math was kind. He looked tired in the way men get tired when they have been arguing with a wall that thinks it is a priest. A gorilla in a suit with epaulets he had not earned yet stood three steps to Harun\u2019s left and did not blink when he did. His lip had a scar I knew. There it was, the boy in the wrong uniform, wearing a face that had been taught how to hold grief like a baton.\n\nMarshal Ketu stood to the right of the tent, away from the boy, away from Harun, as if distancing himself would make the decision he had already made cleaner. He looked not at my uncle and not at the boy and not at the wall that faced the kites. He looked at the rib. He looked at the lighting. He was doing the work good soldiers do when they know the order is not theirs and will leave a stain. His jaw worked once like he had cracked a nut and then decided to swallow shell and meat together to save time.\n\nThe boy with the epaulets was talking low, a voice you could drink and not taste because it had been trained to be palatable. \u201c\u2026not here to hurt you,\u201d he was saying, which is a sentence men say when they have already enjoyed the idea of what hurting you would feel like. \u201cWe want to understand the logic of the thing. It would be so much easier if you\u2019d simply give us the words. It is child\u2019s play to reverse a vent, Harun. Why make it witchcraft.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not witchcraft,\u201d Harun said, and I could hear his mouth snarl into a smile because he was cruel when he needed to be to survive a man like this. \u201cIt is cookery. It is sugar whipped to soft, then stiff peaks. It is soup salted enough to make your grandmother cry.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoetry,\u201d the boy said, bored and old at once, which is a trick taught in certain rooms that I had never forgiven for existing.\n\n\u201cMath,\u201d Harun said. \u201cPoetry is what men like you build guillotines out of when the math tells you your neck is available.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are afraid of guillotines,\u201d the boy said, and here it was, the hole where the tooth would go someday when he stole the right person\u2019s mouth and used it. \u201cWe have kinder machines now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am afraid of idiots,\u201d Harun said. \u201cAnd of boys too brave to listen.\u201d He looked not at the rib, not at the tent, not at the boy. He looked at the lamplight\u2019s edge where darkness cushioned itself against concrete. He did not look at me and he looked at me. He said, in the tone of a man discussing a weather vane with a farmer, \u201cIt\u2019s going to rain in ninety seconds. Put your hat on.\u201d\n\nThe boy glanced up because men like that do not like being told a thing they did not know and immediately need to show they did know it. Ketu moved his head that sliver again, his cat\u2019s tilt. I shut my eyes and put my hand against the pipe and told the vent to pretend to be thunder. The angels shouldered. The air reversed and then un-reversed under the sixth rib because I had not asked enough and now I had a chance to ask again in a language I knew. I counted. The pressure pocket I had left behind woke, stretched, yawned. The bone far under us hummed once, low and patient. Someone up-tier flushed their very expensive toilet and it made a sound that would have humiliated them if they had been able to hear themselves the way the city hears us. The boy turned his head fully and then this happened, this ridiculous thing that only happens when you have lived long enough to see good math. The apes at the other two corners of the false tent\u2014the ones pretending to hold up poles that did not need holding\u2014shifted their weight together. Their balance changed. Their tendons telegraphed to each other the way the apes had learned to telegraph in the forest a long time ago when a leopard looked at them with dinner in its eyes. In that breath, Vetch\u2019s shadows did whatever men like Vetch are for when the sentimental work is done.\n\nIt was ugly and fluid and small and it was over before it had gotten good. The tent\u2019s canvas folded at the wrong time and became a veil. The table tipped itself and became a ramp. Something under the ramp popped, a pop like a toy gun in a child\u2019s hand in an old movie. Ketu looked bored and then he looked annoyed and then he looked like a man who had made a phone call an hour ago that he was glad someone answered. The boy\u2019s epaulets were not where he thought they would be. Harun stood up as if someone had let him. He moved into the space that opened up because the world likes a good stage direction. He did not run. He did not fight. He took two steps like a man going to a faucet to try the water. The ape to Ketu\u2019s left made a decision and put his hand out. His hand touched air where a shoulder had been. The world rearranged around that miss and kept going.\n\nI pushed the grate. It did not give because it had been put there by a janitor in a bad mood with better tools than mine. The nails in my pocket chimed like a warning. The boy with the epaulets said something I will not repeat because some words are like lime on a corpse; they do a job but they burn the living. Ketu did the thing I had not expected him to do, which is to say: he stepped into the boy\u2019s sentence and let his body make a wall that would be punished later in a way he had already accounted for. He looked down into the shaft and he did not smile but the distance between the two corners of his mouth altered, and I saw there a human being and I forgave him for what he had not yet done and might not do. The grate unpinned, heavy with old gum and a decade of skin flakes. I let it ride my shoes. I breathed. I breathed like a person who had put her mouth on a bone and learned a terrible song.\n\nHarun fell, exactly the way your uncle falls when he has been criticizing the ceiling for too long and finally the ceiling gets offended. He did not scream because he is vain. He tucked his shoulder and made a friend of gravity. He hit the lip above me and turned that impact into a pivot with a grace that made me almost laugh because he had never been any good at dancing when my mother made him do it and here he was moving well because he thought his life depended on it. I put my hands up without thinking and I caught part of him and then the rest of him caught itself, and then he was on my face and my face was full of my uncle and my arms were telling my back they intended to be unhappy with me about this tomorrow. I did not say his name because the pipe is an excellent gossip. He did not say mine because he is not a fool twice in one minute.\n\nAbove us the tent became a reason for three apes to lose their jobs in quiet, and the boy with the epaulets learned how to make a promise to himself that would get him through tomorrow\u2019s disappointment. Ketu stayed where he was and did not look down, which is a way to look down in this city that does not leave evidence. I pulled my uncle into the pipe the way a person pulls a very large cat out of the way of a bicycle. He breathed wrong and then right. He smelled like somebody else\u2019s soap and his own sweat and a little like figs because the city is rude and it loves a metaphor. \u201cHello,\u201d he said into my ear because there was no room for hello to land anywhere else. \u201cWe should go.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should,\u201d I said, and I reached behind me, fingers finding the burrs, the old glue, the places the janitors had cursed in three languages over a decade ago. \u201cI hate you.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will need that. It is an excellent fuel.\u201d\n\nWe did not take the way I had come because the city had already mapped it for us and sent men whose feet made no sound to stand at the end of it. We took the way that required a person to know where the pipes sigh in winter and which bends are generous and which are mean. We took the way where the student\u2019s sculpture bled me on the forehead and made me sneeze and the sneeze echoed like a tiny heresy. We took the way where Vetch\u2019s shadow became weight and then absence again like a hand you do not see pulling back a curtain. We took the way that brought us under the first city my mother had told me about, the city you can only smell because nothing of it exists anymore but the scent of a stew made on a frightened night.\n\nBy the time the bone\u2019s room yawned at us again, I had two knees that would not write home to their mothers, a bruise down my spine that would make Fenn swear creative new swears, and a man under my arm who had just refused to give a boy the words that would kill a city because he had promised me a stew and a joke and a mercy. Vetch did not clap. He did not even lift his hands. He looked at Harun like he was a hinge that had done its job and then taken it too far by also deciding to be pretty. The shadow who had smelled like tinned fish sucked their teeth in satisfaction and then stopped because satisfaction is dangerous. The still one looked at us and, for the first time, blinked in such a way that I knew they were not a machine. Somebody put a cup in my hand and then took it away because I wasn\u2019t ready to hold anything. Somebody said \u201csalt,\u201d and somebody else said \u201cno,\u201d and then I was sitting and Harun was sitting and we were a ruin and a joke and a promise and a mouth.\n\n\u201cI heard you kiss the bone,\u201d he said, wheezing a little because he had fallen twice today\u2014the long way and the short. \u201cHow did you like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt tasted like you bragging,\u201d I said, and then I laughed because the laugh needed out and if it didn\u2019t get out it was going to sit in my bones and make bad weather.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he said. He put his hand on my knee because his hand needed a rest more than my knee needed comfort. He looked at Vetch. He looked at the room. He looked at the bone, his old friend, the way men look at an animal they have broken and loved and asked small favors of for a long span of small hours. \u201cYou have to move again,\u201d he said. \u201cHe will come hunting tomorrow with a clean shirt on and a better metaphor and a camera.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are already ghosts,\u201d Vetch said. His voice sounded like a man who has learned to hate the word elegant when men in uniforms use it. \u201cWe\u2019ll show him his reflection. Then we\u2019ll lead him to the water.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t drown the boy,\u201d Harun said. \u201cDrown his future.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that a request or a blessing,\u201d Vetch asked, sweetly murderous.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Harun said. Then he turned to me and let his mouth be soft in a way he would not allow it to be in public because he had watched me be born and had never forgiven me for the way my first cry had made his heart behave like an organ. \u201cWe have a day,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe two. The keystone moves. The Chancellor pretends not to sign the paper because he is courteous enough not to wipe his hands in public. Your tender sits on a desk where the boy will attempt to use it as a lever. You will go home. You will eat. You will sleep in a way that fools your enemy into believing you are not awake. In the morning you will take your wrench to a place no news camera knows how to film and you will change a shape that has been waiting thirty years to be changed the way a jaw waits to be set right. Can you do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can fix,\u201d I said, because I was too tired to be grand. \u201cIt is my one trick.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is every trick,\u201d he said, and he patted the bone as if it were a dog that had chewed a shoe and he was pretending to be angry to teach it patience. \u201cWhat we break on purpose we must be able to break again. That is the covenant.\u201d He hauled himself up, slower than he had fallen, and he swore in a language that had salt dried into its vowels. \u201cAnd Miren. Do not tell your mother I fell out of a tent.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe saw you do worse,\u201d I said, because cruelty is kin to love in this family. \u201cTell me now the word. Whisper it to me like a bedtime story. Tell me not so that I can use it. Tell me so that I can not use it. Tell me so that if the city asks me to eat grief, my mouth will open on purpose.\u201d\n\nHe held my face in his hands and I let him because I am stupid and because love makes bodies surrender to hands they should not. He smiled like the first day he took me to the reservoir and pretended to be the kind of grown-up who knows how to amuse a child without bribery. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, with such mercy that I hated him again. \u201cYou will hear it when you need it. If I put it in your mouth now, you will rehearse. If you rehearse, you will spill. And if you spill, my love, the city drowns on the wrong day.\u201d\n\nI closed my eyes and breathed. The bone hummed. The shadows remembered how to fold. Vetch checked his ink as if there were instructions there he could read without light. Somewhere, up-top, a choir sang the old human song about morning on the river to a room full of men with soft eyes and cameras, and they sang it precisely enough that you could tell they were being watched. I opened my eyes. I stood up. I picked up my wrench. I chose one grief over another as if it were a bolt and not a throat. Then I went to do the job that had my name on it and held, a palm on a surface that needed a hand, the way real power touches the world when it is tired and wants to go home and cannot.",

I slept enough to convince my cells to keep cooperating with my bones, and no more. In the half-dream before the clock\u2019s mouth opened, I chewed a fig that tasted like metal filings and my mother\u2019s handwriting, and I pressed my ear to a door hinge that had learned a lullaby and was humming under its breath. When the chime finally made a little stone skip across the surface of my brain, I got up, rinsed the taste of bone from my mouth with water that pretended to be clean, and put my tools in their slots like a litany because there are mornings that require you to prove you believe in order.\n\nFenn was already at the yard when I got there, sitting astride a crate of sleeves like a queen on an ugly throne. She had that look she gets when she knows before I say anything that the day is going to demand muscles we don\u2019t have and we will make them on the spot. She flicked a pebble at my boot, as if to test whether I\u2019d noted the map\u2019s stupid advice and furnished myself with small stones. The pebble glanced off my toe cap and made a good little sound. She raised her eyebrows as if to say: I approve of your jewelry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a ghosted intake on the north sub-plenum,\u201d she said, which was the city\u2019s version of gossip: a bunch of words about air. \u201cNumbers show somebody edited the curve to please a graph. It\u2019s going to tear itself a new throat before dinner if we let it pretend it is a throat.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo cameras?\u201d I asked, and she snorted because I had just insulted her competence.\n\n\u201cThey tried,\u201d she said, and she bit her lower lip as if it were a wire she needed to strip. \u201cThey put one of those little sugar beads in a bracket so it looks like grease that got ideas. I popped it and it squealed like a piglet for a second and then remembered it was a bead again. Vetch sent a brat to tell me not to eat breakfast first. I ate anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe thinks he\u2019s looking after us,\u201d I said, because it was easier to be unkind to the kind than to name the thing under the thing. \u201cLet\u2019s move.\u201d\n\nWe took the cart because I didn\u2019t feel like teaching my knees any new lessons. The sub-plenum under the north aqueduct was the kind of place cities only let you see if you are either a maintenance worker or a ghost. It was a scar from the old build, a long concrete scar with bad lighting and perfect acoustics for the one song nobody wants to hear, the one that goes: if this fails, people drown and you caused it by believing in bolts. The door pretended to be a blank spot on a blank wall. Fenn hummed three notes and rolled her shoulder into it and the door sighed because it remembered her and opened before it could decide to be coy. Inside the air had a salt edge to it that meant the aqueduct was in a mood and we had brought our moods to match it.\n\nThe intake sat like a sleeping animal that knows it is on the wrong bedding. You could see where somebody\u2014not one of us; one of them\u2014had fiddled the angle on the guide vanes to take a vibration out of a signature during a demonstration, the way you drape a scarf over a bruise and call it fashion. The soprano whine I hated was right there on the edge of hearing, except for the cameras it had been pushed down just far enough to hide under applause. A little bead on the third strut winked and then didn\u2019t. I put my palm on the casing and let the numb hum run up my arm into the old place behind my ear where I keep the city\u2019s noise like a pet. The pressure didn\u2019t like itself. The pressure wanted a different spine.\n\n\u201cDo you want compassionate or do you want quick,\u201d Fenn asked, and I smiled because that is our version of asking whether you want to pull a tooth or the whole jaw.\n\n\u201cCompassionate,\u201d I said, because men with epaulets always choose quick and I like to be contrary when the world\u2019s arithmetic is wrong. \u201cAnd then quick.\u201d\n\nWe walked the circumferential, small step after small step, poverty\u2019s patience. I saw where the bead had chewed a little line into the paint until the primer showed through, a white smile that meant: I am collecting you, keep moving. I slid my nails along the bracket until the little eye saw the glint and fell for it. It clicked. Fenn\u2019s fingers were waiting with a bit of chewing gum and a shred of foil like magic; she palmed the bead and smothered it without waking the alarm behind it because there are gods of small kindnesses even in rooms with tools. We stuck the bead to the underside of an old clipboard and pointed it at a wall where it could listen to concrete breathe and report a shift in politics to a man who hadn\u2019t earned his epaulets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s flattering,\u201d Fenn said, and she rubbed her thumb and forefinger together to rid herself of the gum memory. \u201cThey think we are interesting enough to spy on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey think their reflection is the world,\u201d I said. \u201cIf they could film vacuum, they\u2019d put a title on it and sell ad space.\u201d\n\nWe loosened the man-handled vanes, bolt by bolt. I hummed the ratio under my tongue because I couldn\u2019t help it now that it had taken up residence and put its little plants in my body. It didn\u2019t matter here; the bone\u2019s song was not for metal, not like that, but it helped my breath in the way counting helps you pretend you are rational during a fall. The vane that had been torqued past its happy angle let go with a sigh that felt like somebody taking a bad bandage off. Fenn held the vane like you hold a drunk friend learning to walk sober again. We got the pitch where the math said and where the noise agreed, and when we tightened the last collar the intake did that good thing I love, the almost smile a machine makes when you have let it be what it knows how to be.\n\n\u201cYou made it pretty,\u201d Fenn said, which was her way of praising a fix she couldn\u2019t afford to love.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell,\u201d I said, and I reached up and pressed my cheek for a second against the case because I am a sentimental idiot who thinks steel likes being thanked. \u201cIt will get arrogant.\u201d\n\nWe logged a false number in the board because we have learned to feed the spreadsheet its favorite lies. We tucked the bead-lie in its new little corner and gave it a shadow show to report to its gods. When we came out, the day had gotten the idea into its head that it would be bright. We let it. We walked along the aqueduct spine to the stair where the white moss grows because nobody wants to scrub in the back corners, and Fenn sucked air between her teeth the way she does when she is about to put a finger on the sentence I have kept folded for later.\n\n\u201cYou stink of a man,\u201d she said, and she did not make it a judgment, she made it physiology. \u201cSoap I don\u2019t buy and a tired that has somebody else\u2019s name on it. Do we need to buy a shovel.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, because I had not had time to construct a better lie and the truth was a poor thing that looked worse in daylight. \u201cWe have a day. Maybe two.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou keep making time like bread,\u201d she said, and her mouth went crooked in a fondness that is a knife and a pillow both. \u201cWhat do you need me to do that doesn\u2019t sound like a story until we say it fast.\u201d\n\n\u201cStay close,\u201d I said. \u201cHold tools. Ask me three times whether I\u2019ve eaten. Tell me what I am not thinking of because my head is a highway with too many cars on it. And if someone in black says he wants to understand the logic of the thing, hit him with a wrench and run.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my favorite instruction set,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere do we go be brave next.\u201d\n\n\u201cUp,\u201d I said, because gravity is a suggestion when you are stupid enough to love a city. \u201cWe have to set a jaw.\u201d\n\nThe keystone skeleton rose out of the middle tiers like somebody had dropped a rib cage sideways and asked it to breathe. It was not a single thing. No keystone is, no matter what the speeches try to sell you. It was ducts and throats and little placebos of copper that told big pipes to calm down; it was a pretty glass mask they were building to put over the ugly machine so the cameras could say: look, governance. The tender had gone out in four packets. Our unit had thrown ours up against the wall and watched the equipage we don\u2019t own bounce off and fall into a different yard. A firm with uniforms and a logo that makes people nod had their workers in vests strutting like roosters on the scaffolds, pointing at each other with chalk and pretending the world was a chalkboard. The Cord had installed itself politely at the perimeter, which meant they intended to pretend no one noticed their weapons. The boy with the wrong epaulets was not there. Marshal Ketu was, in a position that would allow him to see angles and pretend he was watching doors.\n\nWe did not go in through the polite way. We snuck in the way maintenance does when the polite way asks you to show your tongue for bites. The third service stair behind the advertisement for oranges took us to a catwalk nobody had measured for the weight of two humans and a bag of sleeves. The mesh trembled a little, unhappy in its old age. Below, a union man yelled at a tech with a ponytail and called the metal by the wrong name. People love to be authoritative about nouns. I put my hand on the bracket that held the case for the east throat and felt its silly little shiver. Somebody had told it to flex to please an algorithm. Somebody had not thought about the day after tomorrow when the algorithm would no longer be watching.\n\nFenn held the bag open and I reached in without looking like I have since we were twenty and both drunk on the cussed joy of finding exactly the right wrench by memory. She felt for my shoulder with her knee to steady me the way she always does. I slid the shim into its mean little place because no camera in the world knows how to film the exact moment a wedge reminds a noisy machine that silence is possible and necessary. The case settled. The vibration that would have announced itself like a bad habit during the demo disappeared the way you only get to watch a sin vanish when you have caught it early and smacked it the correct way. You can fool a governor and you can fool a crowd; you cannot fool metal when it is in a certain mood. We fiddled the second and third and left the fourth alone because the fourth had learned how to pray and I respect devotion in equipment.\n\nKetu\u2019s eyes found us without moving from where they were pretending to study a joint. He did not nod. He did not give himself away to the ceiling. His throatboard flickered once like a fish and then kept still. I looked where he wanted me to look without looking like I was looking, which is an unfortunate skill I inherited with my mother\u2019s vocabulary. The boy with the epaulets had not come in person, but he had sent a proxy: a young mandrill with beautifully braided whiskers and a tablet, fierce in the way you are fierce when you are trying to be the right kind of tool for a bad hand. He stood near the demonstration gallery and pointed at a model of the keystone they had made for show, a thing that would never carry water and was therefore eager to be obedient. The mandrill had a translator clipped to his pocket that turned his voice into syrup. The syrup said words like efficiently and public-private. The crowd of vests listened with the careful excitement people curate when they know a camera sits somewhere behind their left shoulder.\n\n\u201cYou fixed the jaw before he touched it,\u201d Fenn murmured, and she knew because the case under us had stopped trying to complicate my heartbeat.\n\n\u201cI gave it dignity,\u201d I said, because that is a better word in the city than mercy and it offends fewer gods. \u201cHe\u2019ll try it anyway. He\u2019ll say it was always supposed to do this.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Fenn asked without smiling, \u201cdoes your friend with the scar on his lip protect your skinny neck from the epaulets who think about words like efficiently in their sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, because I had promised myself not to lie when I asked for her to be near me. \u201cHe protects the city. If we benefit, it is because the city likes us this week.\u201d\n\nThe demo started because someone said it had started. A man in a clean jacket with a logo lifted his hands, and the throat sang the note it sings when it is about to reverse and make a crowd clap because they love magic even when it is physics. For a second, for the span of an unkind phrase, I thought we had failed because the throat stuttered. Then the shim did its quiet job and the note slid into its correct pitch, and the reversal moved the river in a way that would have made a grandmother nod instead of spit. The mandrill beamed like he had invented air, and the vests clapped as if they were not clapping for the wedge in my pocket and the callus on the web of my thumb. Ketu\u2019s chin moved a degree, which in his body is a laugh and a prayer. I realized I was sweating in a place on my back that is ridiculous. I breathed out. Fenn exhaled the way she does after a long line of tiny welds, a whisper it would be a pity to waste on talking.\n\nThey paraded the keystone\u2019s virtues. Somebody said resilience and meant: this piece of glamour will let us do uglier things with less guilt. A woman with a braid that didn\u2019t move even when she lied talked about communities and smiled on all four quadrants of her mouth. I thought about Harun in the pipe telling me to turn the angels\u2019 shoulders and kiss my mother for him, and I felt again the ratio twitch under my tongue like it was ashamed of being called a word. The boy with the epaulets would watch this later in a room that smelled like disinfectant and good coffee. He would point at a place on the screen where water pretended to be a ribbon and ask whether the ribbon could be cut. I had just made it harder for him to get his scissors to the right edge. It was insufficient. It was still the right thing to do on a Thursday morning.\n\nWe were almost out of the skeleton when the phone in my pocket made that soft bowel-movement sound it makes when my mother texts me, because my mother cannot tell a machine how not to be embarrassing. The text said one word: beans. It meant: are you alive. It meant: I am and I don\u2019t know what to do with it. It meant: come and let me stand in the doorway and hurt you with my love until it becomes tolerable and then have seconds. I typed back the lie Harun had asked me to build with my mouth. I told her I couldn\u2019t come because I had chosen a piece of work over her and I would make it up to her later. I told her not to save me anything because I did not deserve it. I told her anyway that I loved her, because we use that sentence prophylactically in my family and sometimes it does its job and sometimes it does not. The dots blinked. Then the dots stopped. Then she sent a heart, not the one the kids use, the old ugly one that looks like a butt, because she is contrary on purpose when language makes a fashion.\n\n\u201cThere it is,\u201d Fenn said, when she saw my face do the grab-myself thing. \u201cThe day\u2019s most expensive bolt.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate him for being right,\u201d I said, and she put her hand on the back of my neck and let me lean my head for a second on the place between her thumb and forefinger where muscle meets grace.\n\nBy afternoon, the city\u2019s gossip had adjusted its pitch. The intake we\u2019d coaxed into dignity held its line. The boys with cameras went to film a different part of the skeleton, a curl of pipe that looked good in a certain light. The Cord redistributed itself like bread soaked in soup. I had three messages from numbers I didn\u2019t know that asked me to sign things and three from numbers I do know that asked me to look at a leak that had been a leak since the year my father stopped singing. The one that mattered was a string of punctuation from Vetch that meant: down. I ate a packet of almonds as if it were a petition. I stood at a sink and washed the public off my hands. Then I went back to the place no camera knows how to film because it is too sincere to look interesting.\n\nThe bone room had been cleaned. You could only see it if you knew the corners. The cup I had put my mouth on had been replaced with a brother-cup. The shadow who smelled like tinned fish sat cross-legged on the floor, sewing a tear in a canvas roll quietly, using their teeth to pull the thread tight when the knot argued. Vetch had ink on one ear as if he had fallen asleep on an equation and gotten branded. Harun was not here. That was good. That was bad. Vetch saw me and, without fuss, handed me a rice ball a woman I did not know had made with her anger and her salt. It tasted like mercy pretending to be carbohydrates.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re nervous,\u201d he said around whatever he had in his own cheek. \u201cThe boy made a speech to a room of men with more money than taste and told them reverse is the new forward. They clapped. He thinks clapping is a floor you can build on. The Chancellor pretended not to hear him. Ketu sent me a picture of a pigeon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to do with a pigeon,\u201d I asked, but I already knew. \u201cCount the streetlights in the background. Name the chunk in the cornice.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee,\u201d Vetch said, and he put a hand on his heart and bowed as if I were the lesson. \u201cHe is under the Old Post, where they cut the walls thin to save mortar in a year nobody remembers correctly. There\u2019s a crawlspace there that connects to the old bank we turned into a theater for three weeks and then turned back into a bank because the owner cried. They\u2019ll walk him past midnight so the boy can feel like a prince of shadows. We\u2019ll give him a different shadow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to fix a thing before then,\u201d I said, because my body likes to be told the next list item so it doesn\u2019t sit down and refuse. \u201cHe wants the valve chain by the Old Post to act like a flock. He wants them to turn when he whistles.\u201d\n\nVetch made the face he makes when he would prefer onions to exist in a soup of his he has been told should not have onions. \u201cWe gave the flock a shepherd after Red Stairs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe told it the whistle is a dog. It still wants to be a good bird. If he brings a signal that smells like God, it will listen.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have God,\u201d I said, because faith is useful when you use it against people who think they can buy it. \u201cHe has a boy\u2019s mouth and a good camera. If I make the flock go deaf in one ear and pretend not to hear when he blows, can you make him believe his instrument is broken.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can make a man believe he is his instrument,\u201d Vetch said, a little wicked, because he always wanted to be a larger force than he is in a city that does not reward him for existing. \u201cGo. The Old Post\u2019s lungs know you now. They\u2019ll stop coughing when you touch them.\u201d\n\nI took the back ways because after the morning I didn\u2019t have the stomach for anyone\u2019s uniform. The Old Post had a skin like a patient who has given blood for years and now can\u2019t find a vein. The marble steps pretended marble is immortal. The columns pretended they held something more than an idea about power. I slid under a guard rail that had been painted a municipal green so depressing you could taste it if you said the color out loud. The wall had the kind of smudge that looks like four decades and is actually last Tuesday\u2019s cigarette. I pressed the smudge where it had learned to be a hinge. It opened like a mouth that has decided to believe in you for a minute because believing in you is less boring than not believing in you is.\n\nInside, the flock lived stacked in two tiers: old valve wheels big as saints\u2019 halos and newer controls that blinked their small stupid lights to comfort a manager somewhere up-tier who will someday claim to have been on our side. The chain talked to itself in little clacks and squeals because metal likes a gossip and it always has. The west ear was fine. The east ear had been tuned for theatre. You could see the brightness where a Cord engineer\u2014someone like me except their mother probably loves them safely and their soul may or may not be a thing you could locate in a room\u2014had walked in with good intentions and made a beautiful wrong. I put my hands on two places and I spoke to the flock with my wrists. Fenn would say I was flirting with the city again. The chain pretended to resist because machines enjoy being courted. It wanted a different anchor. I gave it two, a ridiculous redundancy, because I am paranoid and the world has earned it. I pulled the east ear a degree into its sulk and then back just shy of where it wanted to settle to force the spring to hold muscle. The whine the Old Post had used to clear pigeons from the eaves in the winter of the old regime woke for a second. I kissed my teeth at it. It minded. It shut up.\n\nWhile I was hunched there with my head in a nest of steel, a pair of polished shoes came to a stop six feet behind my spine and decided not to kick me. Shoes like that rarely learn restraint, so I looked because I am not a fan of unpleasant surprises with good posture. Marshal Ketu\u2019s trousers were creased like a man who has learned how to sit without being comfortable. His suit had been cut to flatter a shoulder that did not require flattery. He had no epaulets. He didn\u2019t need them. They would have been redundant on that mountain of opinion. His mouth did not know whether it had a smile in it and it did not ask his eyes for permission to try.\n\n\u201cYou smiled at the throat,\u201d he said, as if this city were a gossip and it had told him something as private as a woman\u2019s sigh.\n\n\u201cI smiled at the backsplash,\u201d I said, because I am vain about the angles I save, not the ones I show. \u201cAnd at the part where physics pretended to be magic and nobody bled.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a talent for making complicated things obey you for a minute,\u201d he said, and he glanced at the biggest valve the way you look at a stubborn mule. \u201cI do not know if that is a gift or a red flag. In my world, those two things are flirting.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour world should be more honest with itself,\u201d I said, and I stood up slowly, letting my knees tell him how they felt about all this. \u201cYou\u2019re walking him past midnight.\u201d\n\nHis irises did a thing lenses do when they catch more light than they asked for and decide to be gracious about it. \u201cYou have terrible sources,\u201d he said, which meant: your source is exactly right and if I say it out loud I have to tell my supervisors I am still a human being.\n\n\u201cThe boy with the epaulets likes the taste of theatre,\u201d I said, and I let my wrench hit my palm, metal on meat, a metronome I have learned to use on certain men. \u201cHe thinks the city is a room that belongs to him if he knows the passwords. He doesn\u2019t know you text birds.\u201d\n\n\u201cI texted a pigeon,\u201d he said, and his scar did the closest thing it can do to relax. \u201cIt was an artful pigeon.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes he know you\u2019re not going to let him drown your job to prove a point,\u201d I asked, and Ketu looked at the east ear like it had said something unkind about his mother.\n\n\u201cHe thinks I am hungry for promotion and praise,\u201d Ketu said. \u201cHe is not wrong. I am a vain creature. He is wrong about the currency in which I accept payment.\u201d He extended his hand the way men do when they are about to say something you could use to hang them with if you were that kind of person. \u201cIf you have to choose between the lock and your uncle, follow the math. Do I need to tell you what the answer is.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, because he had seen me with my mouth on the bone in his way without seeing me at all. \u201cYou are not the one who gets to make me say it.\u201d\n\nHe inclined his head and did that soldier thing where he steps away from a fact without actually moving. \u201cTonight he will be tempted to draw his gun and point it at the part of your uncle that makes him a good story. No one will fire. I am telling you this so you can keep your hands steady. If you shake on a wrench, the city notices.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he points his gun at my uncle\u2019s mouth, I will break his hand with your permission and without it,\u201d I said, because if you do not say the monstrous thing when it is necessary the monstrous thing will use you later for a spoon.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Ketu said simply, and I believed he meant it and that scared me more than if he had made a speech about order. \u201cEat something. People who faint in tunnels are a damned nuisance.\u201d\n\nHe left before I could tell him I had already eaten something that had reminded me what my uncle\u2019s blood tastes like in metaphor. I finished with the east ear and the west ear and the little childish light that pretended to be reassurance. I wrote two numbers down in a place the bead could see and an entirely different pair in the place my body keeps for tiresome arithmetic. Then I went home because there was nothing useful I could do with the hour except prepare to be useful later, and preparation is a kind of mercy your future self will beat you for if you fail at it.\n\nMy door let me in politely, which is a neat trick, as I have trained it to be rude. The plant in the window was not more alive than it had been at dawn. I kissed it anyway and it cracked in my fingers and I laughed because death is sometimes boyish and that is funny in a horrible way. I made a pan of beans with garlic and cumin and I warmed a hunk of bread that had been ugly since birth and perfect since the oven. I wrote a note to Fenn that said: if I fall asleep, wake me with swear words. I took a shower where the water temperature missed twice and hit once and I forgave it like a woman with poor taste forgives a lover because he remembers to bring tea. I lay down. I put my hand on my own stomach and thought about the lock living in guts, and I spoke to my intestines as if they had ears. Then I closed my eyes and let my head fill with pipes and stairs and the distance between the boy\u2019s epaulets and the place under the Old Post where the wall had thinned to save money.\n\nAt eleven, Vetch sent me a single dot, which is the city\u2019s version of a kiss when it doesn\u2019t want to be cute. I sat up. I put my nails in my pocket because the alarms like coins. I put two cat treats in the other pocket because there is a monster of a tabby that owns the alley near the Old Post and likes to be bribed to not scream at the wrong minute. I shut off the lights. I locked the door and tested it, and I told myself that if I did not come back to this room, someone would keep the plant company anyway. It is a ridiculous thought to use as a charm. It works as well as any.\n\nThe streets at eleven belong to men who want to own them and to women who know how to survive men who want to own anything. I made myself smaller than important men see, and larger than men who think a woman alone is a type of weather. The air had gotten chilly in that way that isn\u2019t personal; the vents had chosen economy over comfort in an inverse-elegant equation I would have admired if I hadn\u2019t been carrying the taste of a word in my mouth like a crumb that would not dissolve. The Old Post\u2019s facade looked innocent in the polite glow from the lights the city installs to show it cares for heritage. Innocence is a lie sheet marble learned to pull over itself a long time ago.\n\nFenn slid out of the shadow across the street like a bulletin you\u2019re not supposed to see and already memorized. She had a bag that looked like it had onions in it and probably did. She had dirt on her face because she is clever about which faces men look at and which they don\u2019t. She did not touch me. She stood close enough that if a truck sprayed the gutter we would both get our shoes wet. That is intimacy in a city like ours.\n\n\u201cYou owe me beans,\u201d she said, mildly, which meant: this is very, very bad and we are going to do it anyway because we are built to fix things until we can\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI made you beans,\u201d I said, because if I did not answer in the same tone my mouth was going to start chanting the lock and scare pigeons.\n\n\u201cThe cat is out,\u201d she said, and she jerked her chin at the low wall near the gutter. The monster tabby regarded me with contempt like a god considering whether to bother with a thunderbolt. I tossed the treats. The cat ate them out of manners. We went in under the rail and through the mean little door we had made mean on purpose. Somebody had scuffed their boots in here earlier today on purpose to make it look like a drunk slept in it last week. The wall breathed. The bone hummed somewhere far enough away that if you hadn\u2019t put your mouth on it you would think you were hearing your own blood.\n\nThe crawl took us under three offices and one room where a woman prayed with the television on. It took us past a little house of old ducts somebody had decorated with cigarette cartons and a drawing of a man with antlers. It took us to the place the Old Post connects to the bank, to the seam where the builder had told the apprentice to use mortar like he meant it and a decade later a different builder had decided to pretend he agreed. It took us to a metal door with a name under the paint nobody uses anymore: UNION. The door had been welded at both sides, then un-welded, then welded again, a story written in bead and bad moods. I put my ear to it. The ear I keep for stories did not hear one. The ear I keep for men in uniforms heard the quiet of orders being preserved in human throats. Fenn touched the floor with her fingertips and then drew one in the air three inches up: skin of dust. No recent traffic. That was a lie. The honorable thing to do with a lie like that is to agree with it out loud so it thinks it won.\n\nVetch\u2019s dot turned into a comma. The comma meant: not yet. It meant: wait on your haunches like a dog that loves the hand that hits it for the food it sometimes offers. Fenn took a nest of wire out of her bag and cradled it the way some women cradle a child. The wire did not coo. It thought about being a bird and decided it liked its shape. I pressed my back to the wall because the wall and I are long acquaintances and I needed to borrow some of its apathy. The vents three corridors over turned their shoulders and pretended to cough to hide the sound nobody was supposed to hear. Then the nobody became somebodies.\n\nThey came like a story people have told themselves to be brave, which is to say: they came in the wrong order, confident men first, competent men second, the camera third. The boy with the epaulets had turned himself out for the night like a bride. His collar could have cut you if you had the wrong dreams. His fur was brushed to a gloss that embarrassed his species. He was flanked by two Cord with arms like the pillars outside, their eyes soft and wide in the way that would make children love them and their bodies unforgiving. Ketu walked behind the boy as if he had been invited to a parade at which he would be required to hold his breath for four blocks and congratulate himself later for the way he\u2019d presented his lungs. Harun was in the middle like a hinge between two doors. His face looked like the inside of the word tired. There was a mouth guard at his throatboard because the Cord hate the idea that a voice could be wiser than a baton. He held his shoulders as if his hands were behind his back even though they were not, out of long habit acquired in rooms where everything that worked was ugly.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d the boy said, with the pleasure of a guest who has slept in your best bed and then tells you your sheets weren\u2019t thread count enough for his skin. \u201cHere is the lesson. You make men fear the rain, they come around to calling you a roof. You make a machine breathe on command, they call you modern. Make it breathe.\u201d\n\nKetu put his hands behind his back and watched the ceiling the way men who know they are going to be held responsible for gravity\u2019s behavior do. One of the Cord moved forward with the portable console, his fingers deft in that way men\u2019s fingers get when they learn to make violence look like typing. The boy put his mouth near Harun\u2019s ear like a lover and whispered, and I could hear none of it because the wall is chaste when it wants to be. Harun\u2019s mouth twisted. He had nothing to say with it. The ratio slept under my tongue like a dog with one eye open. I could feel the far valves I had just taught to be hard of hearing sit up straighter in their sleep.\n\nVetch\u2019s comma flickered and became three dots, which is a trick he learned from women he has loved poorly: hesitate for drama and then deliver a straight line. Fenn\u2019s wire became not-wire, a listening thing that wanted a story. Ketu shifted his weight. The boy lifted his chin. Then something not human listened to something deeply human and tried to decide which of the two it would rather understand.\n\nThey started the show with an innocuous cough of air. The Old Post obliged because it had manners. They tried a whistle, ultra, the kind only children who don\u2019t sleep can hear. The east ear pretended to be stupid and did not turn. The west ear turned a degree and then sulked. The boy\u2019s mouth got that thinness it gets when a plan will require more words than he respects. He made a small gesture with two fingers and the Cord to his left changed the angle on the console\u2019s screen, as if throwing light differently would make physics flatter itself into compliance. Ketu watched the light and not the boy. I watched Ketu\u2019s mouth not smile.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve given your flock a shepherd,\u201d the boy said, and he made it sound like we had offended his god by saving our lives. \u201cYou\u2019ve made yourself necessary. It\u2019s such an old trick I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re still clever enough to try it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTeach the flock to know its cousins,\u201d Harun said, because he had been keeping that sentence under his tongue for six years in case he had an audience. \u201cTeach it who is human to it. Teach it to sing a different ratio when a certain mouth is dead.\u201d\n\nThe boy looked bored because he had no other safe expression to wear at a sentence like that. He put two fingers under Harun\u2019s chin because he wanted to pretend that was intimacy instead of leverage. Ketu said nothing because he belongs to a different theology where touching a prisoner\u2019s chin is beneath a man with rank. I moved my fingers over the screws in the dark the way a woman will move her fingers over beads when she wants to live through a prayer. Fenn breathed like a horse does when the gate opens and it is time.\n\nWhen they realized the flock wouldn\u2019t dance to their whistle, the boy lost interest in instruments and gained it in knives. He turned to Ketu and made a shape with his mouth that meant: permission to bully. Ketu made a shape with his eyes that meant: I accept the fiction of your authority as long as it doesn\u2019t make me drown a child. The two Cord who had been standing as pillars softened. One took a step that meant: pain is coming for you, old man, and you have lived long enough to recognize its gait. Harun, my hinge, my hinge, breathed out as if he were relieved to be alive in a moment when he could be afraid and funny at once. He looked in the direction of the wall where there was no camera and said very softly: \u201cRain.\u201d\n\nI kissed my teeth and the east ear listened. Vetch\u2019s dots turned into a dash and then an O, and the bone under our feet remembered the ratio not as a word but as a kindness you could do a machine. The air in the corridor behind the boy made the polite choice and decided to leave. The pressure drop was small and ungentle. It made ears pop. It made the mandrill\u2019s whiskers shiver. It made the console decide it was lonely and needed a memory. The lights did the thing we call an apology, a stutter as if they had regretted being bulbs and wanted to be stars. Fenn\u2019s wire laughed without making an indecent noise. The two Cord turned their heads like men about to say \u201cwhat\u201d in the tone that starts riots and ends marriages. Ketu stepped to the left in such a way that if a gun came out, the bullet would be tired before it made a mistake.\n\nThe boy did not ask permission. He never meant to. He reached for the weapon because that is what boys do when someone calls them ordinary and they want to be extraordinary and the only dictionary they trust has pictures of machines that throw fire. He did not get there. Ketu\u2019s hand moved, a small, private disagreement he had with the air between the boy and the holster, and the disagreement went the way his hands prefer. The gun stayed. The boy\u2019s mouth made a little shape that embarrassed him, and because embarrassment is a gas that travels, I almost laughed like a sinner. Then I did the thing that was mine to do and pulled the flange two degrees when no one was looking, and the pocket we had made for this moment drank, and the corridor shrugged off the beautiful boy\u2019s posture like a coat that had never fit. Harun stepped without permission and became a man going to get a glass of water. You could not have told, if you didn\u2019t know him, that he had just decided to remind his body what running is for.\n\nWe didn\u2019t go back the way we had come. That is a luxury for people who like to believe in maps. We went into the past instead, through a stair that had been bricked and then unbricked and then bricked again by men who loved hammers more than subtlety. Fenn threw her wire over his shoulder like a scarf and muttered three words in a dialect I hadn\u2019t heard since my father was alive. A door remembered it had been a door. It cut its own nostalgia with a small squeal like a child and opened its little mouth. We slithered into a gap that wanted to be smaller and then forgave us. Behind us, Ketu did something elegant and violent that made the boy cough politely and remember to ask himself if he was willing to be a murderer under the sixth rib in the month of a religious holiday. The corridor we became belonged to mice and lovers and electricians who have retired with two bad knees and more dreams than sleep. We trod like people who had memorized the sound of themselves and were trying to play a different song.\n\nWe came out under a stairwell I did not know I had always known, the one where the graffiti of an old campaign winked at me like a friend, and the smell of fried dough told me the world was rude enough to offer us food in the middle of someone else\u2019s coup. Harun wheezed like a man who has held his breath at the wrong times for thirty years. He held the railing and grinned at me without apology because he does not know how to apologize for still breathing. I would have hit him out of love if we had had time.\n\nWe did not have time. The city had taken our math and gotten drunk on it like a favorite uncle. Fenn pushed a door with her foot that didn\u2019t want to open, and it remembered it had been made for this and performed its little miracle. We fell into the room beyond\u2014one of those rooms that exists because a building needed a place to put its shame for a few years\u2014and found ourselves in a forest of metal ladders and dust ghosts. Vetch\u2019s shadow flicked into being and then cut itself off, which meant the back way was compromised and the front way was face. We did not want face. We chose balance.\n\nHarun sat on a crate of old labels and let his head fall forward for three seconds, exactly three, then lifted it because he will not let his body own him for long if anyone is watching. \u201cWe count again,\u201d he said, as if he had not just turned epaulets into pigeons and risked making me choose to eat him tomorrow. \u201cWhat do we move next. What do we make obedient for a minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mouth,\u201d Fenn said, with no particular venom, and she put a clean cloth in his hands as if he were six. \u201cDrink. Then tell us whether the boy will try sweet or salt if he fails tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cSweet,\u201d Harun said, because he has a nose for men like a dog for a storm. \u201cHe will be at a camera by morning talking about unity and the danger of monopolizing utilities and how the Chancellor is a sentimentalist. He will offer to carry a bucket on-screen like he knows where water goes.\u201d He wiped his face with the cloth and left a stark mark on it like a lesson. \u201cHe will call me a relic. He will not name me. He will be gracious about it. Graciousness is a weapon when you think the field is yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we break his weapon,\u201d I asked, and I did not mean the gun this time. \u201cDo we make the flock dance in public to a song he cannot sing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harun said, and he surprised me by not being hungry for theatre when he had just rehearsed it to a good review. \u201cWe make the flock boring. We make it obedient to nothing but gravity and a few women\u2019s hands. We put our names on bolts in places he has no camera for. We turn the part of the keystone that looks best in photographs into an idiot, and we move the clever into the marrow. We make it so that when he thinks he is calling for a reversal he is ringing for a janitor to bring a mop.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good trick,\u201d Fenn said, admiring despite herself. \u201cDo you have any idea how many idiots will take credit for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Harun said, and he touched my wrist with his fingers warm and rough and a little greasy because he is himself again, finally. \u201cAnd we will let them. We will build a city out of their vanity and our labor and our grief. You in.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was in when the hinge knocked,\u201d I said, because I am a woman who loves stupidly and bolts, and one of those things is going to get me killed in glory or boredom, and either way I intend to make the angle of a thing true before I go.\n\nWe slept in shifts in that room with the ladders. It smelled like old paper and mice and the inside of a pocket, and when I woke to Fenn\u2019s ankle nudging my hip, I had a dream stuck to my tongue that tasted like rust and figs. Morning did its waiter routine again and spilled light across the floor with better balance this time. The radio-that-pretends-it-isn\u2019t in the street said the Chancellor would speak at noon to say nothing in a way that sounded like law. The boy with the epaulets sent a human to the market to buy a basket of mangos and have himself filmed giving it to an old woman who knew enough to take the fruit and not the story. Ketu\u2019s pigeons rearranged themselves so that one would shit on the boy\u2019s jacket at the correct minute for comedy. I went with Fenn to the place between the keystone\u2019s public mouth and its private throat. I carried a shim and a plan and the taste of a word. I did not look up at the ribs, because if you look at ribs too much you start to believe they are protecting you.\n\nWe moved weight. We moved it in handfuls, which is the only way I know. We hid the clever behind ugliness. We gave the stupid a good paint job and told it to smile. Men in vests argued with me about the phrase structural redundancy as if I had not been married to it for a decade. Fenn lied to a drone politely and showed it two nails so it would think we were poor and go away to find someone cooler. Vetch sent us a folded scrap of paper from a boy whose hands were too clean. The scrap had a list: three valves to turn with sorrow, two frames to notch like a lover\u2019s name, a rivet to leave loose in a place where only a cat can see. Uncle Harun did the work he does best, which is to make a room he is not in behave, and which is also a terrible magic I can forgive because he taught me to do it and my hands love him.\n\nBy noon, the city had decided the day would be handsome. The Chancellor\u2019s voice flowed out of the vents like a practiced weather, temperate and ripe. He said a thing about social fabric that made mothers nod and a thing about innovation that made boys in logos feel like fathers. He talked about the keystone as if it were a little god. He did not say what any of us who own a wrench know: that gods die the minute you give them a schedule. I tightened a collar on a pipe with five hundred names carved in its insulation and tried very hard to believe that the mouth that would one day have to say the word to save this city belonged to a woman whose grief could be eaten by a machine and still be human after.\n\nWhen he was done, when the applause had done its job, when the boy with the epaulets had washed the pigeon shit off his jacket in a bathroom with a picture of a fish on the door, my phone made a sound like a stone dropped into water, and the map bloomed with a little violet star that was not where it should be. It sat over Glass Row. It sat over my mother\u2019s block. It sat over her kitchen. The star did not move. It pulsed once, as if it were embarrassed to be a star and would rather be a hinge. Then Vetch wrote a word I have learned to respect in a city that likes to write poetry when it needs to punch you: home.",

                              "content": "The word sat on the screen like a drop of oil on water, too slick to touch with a finger, too heavy to ignore. Home had never been neutral in my mouth. It was a room and a person and an argument and a spice that burned even when you wanted sweet. I did not think. My body had already begun to move because it likes to do the simplest arithmetic first: distance divided by legs, time divided by breath. Fenn saw my face shift, saw the color of the star mirrored in my eyes, and she didn\u2019t ask. She hooked the bag to her shoulder and fell in at my left like we had rehearsed this exact run. Maybe we had, every time we had carried a pipe through a crowd and people had moved without seeing that we were the reasons their air would be kind later.\n\nThe middle tiers showed their teeth as we pushed through. Somewhere a choir was practicing again because the city was greedy for harmony, or because someone was measuring how many notes it took to keep the boys with cameras from noticing the scaffolds where the keystone was uglier than promised. The lift had a line of people with damp collars and patient jaws. We took the stairs because I am superstitious about boxes when my blood is doing math. I counted the risers I know by heart, my palms sliding the greasy rail where hands had written their skin for a decade. There are little stories everywhere in this city. The one under my hand said: don\u2019t let go; the one under my feet said: we carry you and we squeal but we do not break yet.\n\nOn Glass Row the light was a clean lie. The window washers had finished their run and the panes wore their skins like a fancy suit with stains hidden in the hems. The market was bright and fussy and pretend-safe. The boy with the wrong epaulets had sent his camera to another square by now, a place with better shadows. My mother\u2019s block smelled like sugar char and metal polish and the detergent the clinic gave out in packets with a stupid logo printed on them in blue. I had never understood who the logo was supposed to comfort. People comfort themselves with the idea of order. Machines comfort themselves with the rhythm of being allowed to run.\n\nThe green of my door looked like it had been repainted by a person trying to remember an old recipe and substituting salt for sugar. Vetch\u2019s violet star sat right over it and pulsed again as if it were breathing. I put my ear to the panel and there was a wrong silence on the other side, a silence that had organized itself with chairs and good intentions. Fenn\u2019s shoulder brushed mine and that was her way of saying: I am here; I will not let you do this alone; if I die, make it at least a little funny. I bent and touched the seam with my nails because I wanted the bead in the jamb to look at something small and inexpensive while I did something big and costly. The lock was keyed to my pressure and breath. It obeyed, loyal and stupid and mine. The door opened two fingers\u2019 width and stopped as if someone inside was holding it with the tips of a hand.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a hand. It was a string. A trick my mother hates because tricks that rely on women\u2019s fastidiousness offend her. I slid my blade into the gap and lifted the thread off its hook before it could tell a bell to sing, and the bell, poor thing, slut for drama, kept its notes to itself. I made the gap a palm, then an arm, then a person. The smell hit first. Not smoke. Not blood. Cardamom and milk and the faint medicinal clean of the clinic\u2019s favorite wipe, and under all that the iron of a pan that had been left on a burner just long enough to think about turning black. You would not have known anything was wrong except the cups were too clean and the plant on the sill was too upright. My mother does not overwater her plants. She threatens them with religion and neglects them into vigor. Someone had given this one attention. That was how you knew a stranger had loved your house.\n\nShe was at the table with her back to the door, her hair tied up with a scarf old enough to have been a flag at one of the marches she denies she attended. She held a spoon. She was stirring nothing. She did not turn when I came in. She did not say my name in the tone that means: you did not text and I am pretending to be wounded for fun. She said, \u201cIf that pot was supposed to boil, it would have boiled.\u201d Her voice was too even. She is never even. Evenness is a betrayal her mouth does not forgive.\n\n\u201cMa,\u201d I said, and I had to make the word heavier than it wanted to be or it would have flown out the window. \u201cWe got a message. Are you all right.\u201d\n\n\u201cI made beans,\u201d she said. The spoon clinked. The pot did not answer. \u201cYour uncle eats like a bird but he licks the spoon. He is vain about the sound it makes if you put the spoon down hard enough.\u201d She put the spoon down and didn\u2019t make a sound. Fenn stayed at the door, one foot inside, one out, a hinge with a pulse.\n\n\u201cThey came,\u201d I said, and my mouth made a straight line like I could put facts on it and have them balance. \u201cDid they come. How many. Did they leave anything,\u201d and I almost laughed because of course they had, they had left their smell on the plant and their hands on the air and the feeling in my feet that the kitchen had shifted half a degree under us.\n\n\u201cThey came like birds,\u201d my mother said. \u201cThey stayed like men.\u201d She turned then and I saw the way the skin had tightened around her eyes, not from crying. She does not cry when men come to tell her things she already knew about where power lives. She gets sparse. She puts her words in the drawer where she keeps her mysteries because she thinks if the words sit still they will outlast the day. \u201cHe was here. The mouth boy. He was very clean. He didn\u2019t sit. He looked at my cups and then he looked at my hands and I could see his brain thinking: these hands will not be my hands and that makes me angry.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he touch you,\u201d Fenn asked, and I loved her for the bluntness of it because sometimes language has to drop its jewelry and ask ugly questions.\n\n\u201cHe put his eyes on me like a thumb,\u201d my mother said, and she closed her hand around the air so precisely the air behaved like a thing you could bruise. \u201cHe brought a basket of fruit and a man with teeth named a different language than mine and a woman who thought I might ask her for help. I did not ask.\u201d She looked at me the way she used to look at my report cards when I was twelve and had decided to fail art because the teacher was cruel about perspective. \u201cHe said the Chancellor is old and the city is new and that old women like me should stop breaking cramps into its calves.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you said,\u201d I asked, because part of me was in another room of another year listening to her pull a man\u2019s words apart with a fork and feed him the pieces until he apologized to his own mother for learning to walk in a world that had not taught him to bow.\n\n\u201cI said my cramps were older than his mother\u2019s milk,\u201d she said. \u201cHe liked that. He likes it when women are knives. He doesn\u2019t mind bleeding if it makes a picture. I told him we reused lids and that we do not trust clean-jacket boys with soft eyes who use words like unity as if we all owned the same walls. He set his basket down on my counter anyway, like an offering. He said: tell your brother we would like the bone song. He said: tell your daughter we will make her a suit that fits. That is when I decided to be still because if I was not still I would have killed him with my spoon.\u201d\n\nFenn exhaled a small laugh that was shaped like a swear if you held it to the light. I went to the counter and looked at the basket because I am a fool for objects. The mangos were perfect in the way expensive fruit is always perfect. The oranges had their leaves still attached as if they had gotten lost on their way from the orchard to the set. There was a card. There is always a card in this city because men like to write their names on other people\u2019s air. The card said: With respect, M. It tried to be modest and failed at it like modesty fails when it meets a camera.\n\n\u201cDid you take anything,\u201d I asked, because poison is ordinary where I grew up. You check. You make people drink first who brought you delights. You do not eat fruit from men who want your city\u2019s throat.\n\nMy mother snorted, and in that sound was all the contempt she has for the idea that a mandrill\u2019s politeness could trick her into eating a story. \u201cI put the basket in the oven,\u201d she said. \u201cI turned the oven on for a minute. Let him smell his mangos become jam. He did not like that. He said it was waste. He has never met a pantry.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe left anything of his,\u201d I asked, because I was thinking of the hinge and how they had learned we answered to objects with a memory.\n\n\u201cHe left a shadow,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is in the corner by the plant. I have not swept it yet. I was waiting for you. I thought you might tell me whether it is good luck or bad.\u201d\n\nI went to the corner like I could kneel to a superstition and have it tell me an engineering truth. There was nothing to see. There was a temperature that had not yet joined the room. There was a smell like a shirt taken off politely. There was a little grease thumbprint low on the wall where a person would steady himself if he leaned to look under the radiator for a listening device. I touched it with my nail and the print lifted the way soft gum lifts threads. I pinched it and let the bead in my pocket taste it. The bead told me, in its dumb consumer way, that the grease contained a perfume that sells itself with the word cedar and a machine oil that only the Cord buys in this particular formulation because the supplier is a cousin of somebody who looped them in during the seventeenth minute of an old revolution and now cannot not take their order. I wiped the bead with a dishtowel because even my paranoia has manners in my mother\u2019s kitchen.\n\n\u201cWhat did he want truly,\u201d my mother asked, and she did not mean the bone song. She meant the shape under the shape, the mouth under the mask.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to know which door we will choose when the city asks us to be a hinge,\u201d I said, and my voice was too steady because I was performing for my mother and I know better and I could not do better right now. \u201cHe wanted to know whether he can pull you and have me fall like a kettle on a hook.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not a kettle,\u201d she said, and her mouth did a thing like she was remembering a joke my father told before he became a memory. \u201cYou are a wrench with a temper.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay wrench again,\u201d I said, and we both laughed because sometimes love needs a word that is a sound your mouth makes that isn\u2019t I\u2019m sorry or I forgive you.\n\n\u201cThey took nothing,\u201d she said then, and the laugh turned into a rope again, something for both of us to hold. \u201cThey left a promise. He said he would come back with a camera and a priest. He said I would want to be seen forgiving him. I told him to bring better shoes.\u201d\n\nThe violet star on my phone dimmed, as if satisfied that I had done the arithmetic and shown my work. Vetch sent a second word, a little one that tries to be brave and usually is: later. Ketu did not text. Ketu would not text in my mother\u2019s kitchen because this room does not want certain uniforms to learn its scent.\n\n\u201cMa,\u201d I said, and this was going to cost, and I let it. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a thing that looks like a party at the keystone tomorrow and it will be a party only for men who like to watch water pretend to be art. If it smells wrong, if people start pointing toward the vents with more interest than a tourist, if you see somebody who looks like the boy\u2019s mouth but not his eyes, you go to the clinic. Harun has keys. Vetch has a door that wants to like you. Do not stand in a window. Do not let a camera into your list of mugs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not young,\u201d she said, and she meant: you think I have not done this dance before.\n\n\u201cYou are mine,\u201d I said, and I felt the order of the world inside my bones try to argue with me and then give up because right now it needed to be in the mouth as a fact. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\nShe put her spoon down for real this time and the spoon made the right sound. She stood. She crossed the room and did the thing she had not done in three years and three months and nine days. She put her hand on the back of my neck and pulled my forehead gently against her shoulder like I was a hot pan that needed holding with a cloth. My body did something ungenerous with my lungs for a second and then forgave me for surviving. Fenn looked at the plant as if it were an instrument she could tune and not a witness to sacred nonsense.\n\n\u201cYou think he will make you eat your uncle,\u201d my mother said into my hair, plain as bread, because she cannot not say the sentence that matters once she has used up all her patience on men with baskets.\n\n\u201cI think the city will,\u201d I said, and the truth of it made the tile under my feet think about becoming ocean. \u201cHe is only a boy with coins. The city is a god with habits.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you will brush your teeth and say your prayers and you will tell your stomach to be proud of itself,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not made to be pets to gods. We are made to fix them when they go stupid. If you must eat grief, chew. Don\u2019t swallow whole. Your grandmother taught me that and she was bite marks from head to toe by the time she died and still she did not choke.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate you,\u201d I said, because it would be too big to say the other thing. \u201cI hate that you talk good and it works.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said, and she kissed my temple in the small old way that makes you think of a broom leaning, not a trumpet gone off. \u201cHate makes your hands sharp. Go fix. Bring me my brother if you can. Bring me a rumor if you can\u2019t. Bring me back my pot if they take it.\u201d\n\nWe did not linger because lingering builds altars to fear. We took her empty pan and her clean spoon because props convince the eye and we needed to look like women doing domestic things, not women walking out of a room that had just been told it was a set. In the hall, the neighbor\u2019s child had fallen asleep on a slab of cardboard like a king on a raft. Someone had drawn a mustache on the Chancellor\u2019s face in a poster with a biro that had been running out of ink for five minutes and was valiant about it anyway. A Cord we didn\u2019t know leaned on the far corner and pretended to be bored. His ears were too clean. His shoes were wrong. You could tell he was not from here because he did not look down to avoid stepping on the corner where everybody knows the tile cracks and will bite your foot if you don\u2019t respect it.\n\nHe said, \u201cAfternoon,\u201d and the way he said it was not a question or a challenge because he had been taught better by someone who cares about logistics.\n\n\u201cEvening,\u201d Fenn said, and the distance between those words was a line of infantry. He glanced at the pan. He glanced at my face like he had a gun he didn\u2019t want to draw and a history he didn\u2019t want to explain. I inclined my head because I am tired of making enemies when all I\u2019ve got in my hands is a spoon and somebody else\u2019s plant dirt on my sleeve.\n\nOn the stairs, the building\u2019s old song returned, the creak and reassure of a place that had learned to hold all the absurd weights we ask of it and still not collapse. We did not talk until we were past the place where the boy with the epaulets would have put a microphone if he had thought of it, and he hadn\u2019t because he thinks microphones live in rooms with better chairs. I blew out a breath and almost tasted the ratio again because it has moved in like a tenant who will clean if you feed it.\n\n\u201cI was ready to hit him with the pan,\u201d Fenn said, cheerful and savage because she refuses to let fear be the only animal in her mouth. \u201cI would have rung him like the bells in the old temple we don\u2019t have. It would have been elegant.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would have felt good in your elbow,\u201d I said, and I could picture the arc her arm would make, perfect geometry in a space that wanted a new line. \u201cHe left a smell. They\u2019re going to script a forgiveness tomorrow. They\u2019ll want my mother to be a saint in their movie.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not a saint,\u201d Fenn said, and she loves my mother as much as she can love anyone who is not a machine that needs her. \u201cShe\u2019s a knife. They can put a halo on a knife. It still cuts.\u201d\n\nWe crossed the plaza with the sculpture that used to be a fish or a promise. Vetch\u2019s shadow slouched off a wall and attached itself to our heels with the courtesy of a cat deciding to escort you as far as the door. He didn\u2019t materialize because he does not materialize when my mother has watched us walk away. He respects a woman\u2019s sightline. He sent a single message instead, not even a word, an old symbol our parents learned to write on walls when walls were good for writing on: an eye. He was not telling me not to sleep. He was telling me we were being loved by the city\u2019s worst and best gossip at once.\n\nThe afternoon had the exhausted quality days get when they have been made to wear costumes. The keystone crew packed their cables into bins like ribs into a trunk, careful with the things they could bill for, careless with the things they could not. Ketu posted himself where the upper tier\u2019s shadow cut the atrium in half, an unowned timepiece. He watched nothing with the attentiveness other men use for a lover\u2019s face. Once, his eyes brushed mine and it felt like being checked by a good mechanic: you knew what he would find, and you were already ashamed of the parts you hadn\u2019t replaced yet. He didn\u2019t nod. He didn\u2019t move. He let the city\u2019s wind make an argument against his jacket and the jacket lost.\n\nWe worked until our muscles made that happy low complaint that tells you they believe in you again. We sorted lies into piles. We taught two more valves to be stupid on purpose. We tucked a wedge where it would look like a manufacturer\u2019s mistake until the day it saved a crowd of children from a show of pressure in a pipe that should not have been flirted with. I sent a kid with wrongs tattooed on his knuckles to the upper freight lift with a spool of cable and no paper so he could watch who stopped him and who didn\u2019t. He came back with a new scratch on his jaw and a grin that said: I am doing something larger than a paycheck and I will regret it later and I love you for it.\n\nAt dusk the light did its cinematic trick across the glass and the banners looked like knives on a wall. People took pictures that will live forever in little black boxes until their children cannot remember what their faces looked like without the filter that pretends this color is how the world always was. The Chancellor\u2019s schedule leaked to the street like a clean sock out of a laundry bag. He would be in the lower wards at eight, shaking hands with a man who sells noodles and a woman with a cat that meows like a fax. The boy with the epaulets would be on a balcony at seven, reading a poem written by someone his staff had found who could make the word infrastructure rhyme with a word you would want to put in your mouth twice. Those are the nights you hate this city and love it enough to kill for it.\n\nWe were wiping our tools with someone else\u2019s clean rags when the alarms at the corner of Glass Row and the clinic\u2019s alley hiccuped. It wasn\u2019t the siren. It was a small sound a careful system makes when it has sensed a human making a human\u2019s mistake. Fenn\u2019s head went to the side, listening like a cat. My phone did the stone-in-water sound again. Vetch\u2019s eye turned into a line and then into a word. He is careful with his words even when he wants to be dramatic. He wrote: drawer.\n\nI didn\u2019t run. I walked because that is scarier when you leave a place and you want everyone with eyes to understand that your bones are doing math and the answer is: inevitable. Fenn fell in two steps behind me. The clinic\u2019s brick had been scrubbed by someone in a good mood last week. The door was half ajar because the clinic believes in access and has been punished for it and refuses to stop being itself. The waiting room smelled like the end of the day: bandage glue and baby sugar and a bowl of soup cooling itself on a desk because the nurse who brought it had remembered at last that she was a person. A child sat on a man\u2019s lap and played with a rubber syringe like a gun and his mother took it from him gently and lied with her eyes about why he could not have it. Behind the curtain three voices braided a number. The number was wrong and then fixed. The back hall had a scuff I put there when I was fourteen and learning how not to run in homes that are not houses.\n\nThe drawer lived in the kitchen because kitchens are where you keep your gods if you are honest about what you feed. My mother had told me about placing things in it without looking at them, without naming them, a ritual of respectful ignorance. I had never opened it without her because superstition is a tool I respect even when I do not obey it. The drawer was open now. Inside, the ribbon, the doll, the buttons. The green ashy strip from the election where we ate boiled rice in a room full of men who didn\u2019t clap for the right reason. The tiny carved fish my father made out of a pipette pip while the generator sang a dirty lullaby in the corner. And on top, laid like a hand you didn\u2019t ask to hold yours, a new hinge. Not the one from Red Stairs. This one hadn\u2019t been cleaned. It had its rust on, scabbed and true. Where the other had the memory of a door the city had taught to open and close on a list of crimes, this one had nothing but door in it, the simple honest weight of two worlds agreeing to meet and then part on schedule.\n\nUnder the hinge lay a piece of paper folded so many times it had learned to become almost square. I looked at Fenn and she looked at me and we both agreed with our faces that we were going to do the wrong thing and call it loyalty. I unfolded the paper. In the square was a drawing a child could have made if the child had known how to draw accurate. It was my mother\u2019s block, sketched in with a house where the plant is and a balcony where the boy dumps water on himself and crows. There was a cross on my mother\u2019s kitchen. There was a line drawn from the kitchen to a dot under the street. There was a word in my uncle\u2019s careful technical hand where people used to write other people\u2019s names on the backs of photographs and pretend that would preserve them from being forgotten. The word was not a word. It was the symbol we use in my unit when we are telling each other there is a bleed you can use, the way you nick a hose to let the pressure escape so your hands don\u2019t get bit when you unscrew the collar.\n\n\u201cThey put a throat under her sink,\u201d Fenn said, and the awe in it was complicated because it takes gall to run a pipe that close to a woman like my mother. \u201cHe hid it in her house. He hid a god under her soup.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a god,\u201d I said, and I touched the hinge the way I would touch a cat I cannot trust. \u201cA confession. A choice. He gave her the lever and trusted her not to flip the room over when she got mad.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we tell her,\u201d Fenn asked, simple as switches, and I did not know whether to love her or hate her for the way she asks so well.\n\n\u201cWe show her,\u201d I said, because my mother\u2019s respect cannot be coerced. \u201cIf they come back with their cameras and their priest and their mangos, she needs not a speech. She needs a knob she can turn with her old hands and make a boy learn his name.\u201d\n\nWe went to the sink like thieves with manners. We pulled the pot aside. We kept the spoon on the table where she had set it, a promise to put things back. The panel under the basin had a crack where a crack should not be. The fixings wore their age with pride. Behind the board lived the cage that keeps industrious rodents out of your plumbing and useful rodents in it. Behind the cage, a throat. Not big. Big would be felt. Small and precise. Older pipe married to new with the kind of elegance I have to call pretty out loud or it will become a sin in my chest. The throat had a turn that wasn\u2019t in the plan I had built in my head when I was fourteen and imagined I would wield a house like a wrench. It had a valve with a face that wanted to pretend it was part of the trap. It had a collar that would bite you if you insulted it.\n\nFenn held the light. I put my fingers in where my mother had never let me put my fingers because she raised me not to play with the house\u2019s guts. The valve purred when I touched it because it knew me the way a piece of inherited jewelry recognizes a wrist. Under my hand, the Vetch-song that ties appetite to pressure hummed once and then kept quiet because this throat was polite in a kitchen. The little bleed Harun had drawn waited like a scavenger, a quiet gift: if you open this, the pipe will confess before it screams; if you open this, the boy\u2019s console will think it has lost its voice and panic; if you open this in the forty seconds after a lie has gone on your mother\u2019s air, you will get to watch a camera make an ugly face and you will like it.\n\nWe put the board back. We set the pot just so. We put the hinge in the drawer and closed it. I wrote Vetch a sentence he would read three times to make sure it didn\u2019t say more than it said. He responded with a drawing of a pigeon with a halo, which was his idea of a joke about Ketu being an angel of the stupid. I washed my hands at my mother\u2019s sink and the water came out clean and made the sound it makes when it has decided to love you. We left the clinic without looking like we had done anything but argued about the right way to store cloves.\n\nNight came in a harder shirt. The city clicked into a different gear. Men who had not been outside since morning remembered they had bodies and those bodies needed salt. Women who hate the boys with cameras put on lipstick like war paint because if you are going to be seen you should at least choose your color. The keystone gleamed because lights had been hung on it the way people hang jewels on statues they do not actually pray to. The Chancellor\u2019s entourage made the air around them smell like expensive wool. The boy with the epaulets had a spot of darker fabric on his shoulder disguised with grooming and tragedy. Ketu stood at the east end of the rib I had taught to be dignified and looked like a man paying respect to a beast he cannot love because he loves its work too much.\n\nWe positioned ourselves where we could not be useful until we were, which is a skill I had to learn out of spite. Fenn took the rail above the gallery where the vests would clap on cue. I went to my mother\u2019s block because the star had told me home and the drawer had told me plan and my mother\u2019s hand on my neck had told me pick your grief, and I had chosen the one that let me fix something first. In her window, a plant I had thought was awake this morning had put on a new color. That was absurd. You cannot expect botany to conspire with politics. I laughed, small and ridiculous, because sometimes the city gives you a gift that is not for you and you take it anyway and pretend it will become a tool.\n\nThey came with their camera and their priest and their basket at seven-fifteen, right on schedule, men who think schedules are a moral instrument and not just a way to stack bodies neatly. The priest was the kind they train now, gentle and correct, able to look at you and make you feel like you are being blessed for surviving commerce. The camera was small and kind-looking. The basket had mangos in it that had not been in anyone\u2019s oven. The boy had put his mouth in the nice line, the one he uses when he wants mothers to like him the way they like certain television doctors. My mother opened the door and did not ask them to wipe their feet because she did not want them to believe they belonged to her floor. They asked her to forgive the new order for its sins. They asked her to bless the keystone with a woman\u2019s patience. They asked her to sing a lullaby to the vents, to show that the old women are with us.\n\nShe let them come into the kitchen because she is not afraid of other people using her light. She took the basket because you take the gift when it is offered in public or else you look mean and they use that as a weapon in the edit. She said a thing about fig cakes in a tone that made the priest want to laugh and made the boy want to remove his jacket and fight. Then the camera turned toward the sink because the sound person told it kitchens make good television, and I was already under the window in the alley with my hand in the crack the board makes and my fingers on the bleed my uncle had left for me like a blessing and a dare.\n\nThe voicework in a machine is holy when it is right. The camera\u2019s little mic greedily drank. The boy said the word unity the way men say the word when they mean obedience. My mother said the word patience the way women say it when they mean you are so lucky I am polite. The priest began the cadence that was going to be cut to make a song and live on a thousand screens and be used, afterward, as a hammer. I turned the bleed. It turned. The throat sighed. The console over in the keystone gallery coughed politely and forgot to do its trick. The air at the corner of the room decided not to be cool in the way cameras love because good cameras like a little sweat. The boy\u2019s mouth lost its soft. The priest said \u201coh\u201d and then disguised it as \u201camen.\u201d The camera saw nothing and that nothing will look like something later, and you will not be able to explain to your neighbor why you love this scene so much, but you will feel the tug in your throat that says: someone set a jaw somewhere and I can taste it.\n\nMy mother, goddess of my first breath and my last argument, looked straight into the lens and felt the lack of air the way only women who have cooked for people in rooms without windows can. She took the spoon and tapped it on the edge of the pot and made the right sound again and the little bell that boy hung by the hinge yesterday so pretty and sneaky forgot its name and did not ring. She said, \u201cNo,\u201d the way a woman says it when she is the door and not the hinge and you are the wind and you have forgotten your place.\n\nThey stood there and did not know where to put their hands because they had come expecting a ritual and got a rule. The boy looked over his shoulder like a kid in a schoolyard looking for his bigger cousin to back a play that has already failed. There was no cousin. There was only the city, and the city was uninterested in helping boys finish sentences that had cost us so much to learn. The priest did the correct thing, which was to lower his head and admit he was not what the room needed. The camera did the wrong thing, which was to keep filming, because cameras are hungry and never know when to say enough.\n\nIt was delicious, the tiny, mean thing that happened then, the way a trick has a taste. I am petty. I will die with grease under my nails and this petty sugar on my tongue. Vetch sent a dot in the shape of a giggle. Ketu, out there under the rib, coughed meaningfully, and anyone who hears that cough later will think he was clearing his throat to speak a line that was not his to say. The boy put the basket down again, harder, and one mango fell and rolled, and my mother stepped on it by accident, and the mango made a joke on the floor and the priest laughed because he could not help himself. You could feel the edit being made in a room with bad lighting by a man with sore wrists who does not actually hate people like me but will make my life harder because the boy pays him.\n\nWe did not gloat in public. We do not teach the city how we survive. I closed the bleed. The throat purred as if someone had petted the dog inside it. My mother told the boy he could leave his basket on the table and take back his spoonful of apology. He did not punch anybody. That is how you know he is a real danger and not a child. He left with the priest who had forgiven him for existing in the wrong shape because that is what priests do when they are right with themselves. The camera trailed after like a tired bird. When the door was shut and the hall was empty and the silence in the apartment belonged to the kitchen and not to a stranger\u2019s politely arranged chairs, my mother leaned out the window and looked down at the alley where I was still crouched like a burglar.\n\n\u201cYou are stupid,\u201d she said, love like a hot coal in her mouth because it burns and you keep it because it keeps you from freezing. \u201cYou are my child.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore the second than the first,\u201d I said, and I stood because my knees were going to remember this conversation in the morning. \u201cWe made him step on a mango.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think I do not appreciate art,\u201d she said, and she laughed once, low, private, the kind she saves for people who have earned hearing it. \u201cGo. The boy will bring you a present for what you did. It will have a hinge. It will come with a man who wants to be your friend. It will be wrapped in respect. Don\u2019t open it unless you are hungry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am always hungry,\u201d I said, and that was truer than it should be and wrong in all the ways that make a person useful to a city like ours. \u201cI will build something ugly tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake it beautiful,\u201d she said, and she meant: make it obedient to women\u2019s hands, not men\u2019s mouths. \u201cThen make it ugly on purpose where it counts.\u201d\n\nWe went back into the night toward the keystone\u2019s ribs, toward the bone\u2019s hum, toward the boy\u2019s camera, toward whatever new hinge the city thought it could bribe us with. Vetch\u2019s pigeons had arranged themselves to say a rude word in a language only a few of us still know. Ketu stood exactly where he had been, and when I passed him he did not look at me. He said, to nobody in particular, in a tone you could drink and not get drunk, \u201cThe wind is shifting.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does that,\u201d I said, without stopping. \u201cWe taught it.\u201d\n\nHe did not answer because he did not need to, because sometimes a city will let two people be a door without making either of them the hinge. We took the stairs, we kissed the bolts with our tools, we lied to the cameras with our faces, and somewhere in a room that smelled like milk and spices and a little like oil, my mother put a hinge in a drawer and kept it safe for a day when somebody needed to be reminded that doors are not just for pretty speeches.",
