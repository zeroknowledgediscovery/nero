The call came in under a brittle Helsinki sky that had forgotten how to be blue. The Harbor was a smear of metal and ice outside his office window, and Eero Kallio was mid-sentence, drafting an email about a minor contractual dispute concerning boat engines, when the strange number flashed onto his phone. +44. Laila’s desk creaked on the other side of the glass divider; she was humming something tuneless that had gotten stuck to the morning.

He considered letting it go to voicemail; there were deadlines, and his coffee had cooled into something grim. But the +44 tripped a thread of curiosity he’d learned not to ignore.

“Eero Kallio,” he said, and heard his own voice snag on the fact that he’d said it in English.

“Mr. Kallio, hello! It’s Maria Hughes, producer on The X Factor. I hope the time difference isn’t too rude?”

The clatter in his chest belonged to somebody else and then entirely to him. He pressed the phone closer to his ear as if he could fall through it in the right way. The X Factor was not a show he pretended to be above. He watched it when the nights sank too early and the office lights kept pretending to be the sun.

“It’s—no, it’s fine. Hello,” he said, standing up without realizing.

“Fantastic. Listen, I’m calling with some rather brilliant news. One of our finalists has had to withdraw due to unexpected… issues, and the judges have put your name forward to step in. We’d love for you to come to London for the final this weekend.”

He stared at the copy of the Finnish Arbitration Act open on his monitor. It didn’t blink. He did. “I—step into the final?” he repeated, because language sometimes needed the echo to make it real.

“The final, yes. You made such an impression in auditions, and in the six-chair challenge, even though you chose to go back to your regular life at the time—well, we haven’t forgotten you, and neither has the public. The feedback on your clips has been incredible. It’s quite an extraordinary situation, and we think you’d be perfect.”

He searched for the memory of that day. The audition. The stage that wasn’t a courtroom. The light. There was the echo of his mother’s laugh in it, maybe, and his sister’s exasperation at another of his impulses. He remembered a slow song pulled from the winter in his mouth, all vowels and hurt, and the judges standing up. Seline Hart smiling like a fire was being polite for the camera. He remembered a hand on his elbow as he left the stage. He remembered his name in four syllables uttered like they had another language written behind them.

But details were a scattering of leaves, damp and sticking to each other and not yet a clear path.

“That’s… extraordinary,” he said. Laila looked up from her own world and mouthed, You okay?

“You’ll come?” Maria said. Behind her, the hum of a production office situated itself: printers, someone laughing too loud, the clink of a cup onto saucer.

He had court on Monday. He had a client who swore they never signed that NDA. He had a frozen radiator that ticked like a small heart in the corner of his bedroom.

“I’ll come,” he heard himself say. He doesn’t remember thinking it, only that he’d had to stand up for the room to be large enough to hold it.

“Brilliant! We’ll send you flights, hotel, everything. Song choices, wardrobe, you know the drill. Maria—me—will text you my direct number. Get to London tomorrow if possible. Oh, and Mr. Kallio?”

“Yes.”

“Congratulations.”

The call ended in a little bell sound that felt invented precisely for this. The room wobbled. Laila tapped on his glass with a pencil, then got up and just came in, not asking.

“You look like you saw a ghost.”

“You know the British show?” he asked.

“The one where the one with the hair cries and throws chairs? Yes.”

“They want me in the final. The X Factor asked me to fill in. It’s this weekend.” He smiled sideways, the way his father used to when he was hiding a move in chess.

“Shut up,” Laila said, delighted, and then, quickly softer, “Oh. You’re serious. Wow. Eero, that’s—wow.” She hugged him, hazel hair smelling like snow and mint gum. “That’s insane. But like… you did audition, yes? I remember you disappearing for a day and coming back with glitter stuck to your eyelid.”

“I did,” he said. The glitter had been on the cuff of his sleeve, difficult to account for in the Marchdom of his wardrobe. He wanted to remember what song he had chosen. He should know, shouldn’t he? Isn’t that the tidy fact you keep? It slid away when he reached for it, like a word you forget on purpose.

He texted his sister, Marja, who was a nurse in Turku and allergic to sentiment in the way of very sentimental people. She called immediately.

“Is this a prank?” she said. “Because if this is a prank I am prepared to be impressed.”

“It’s not. They’re flying me there tomorrow. They said I was… I made an impression. Do you remember what I sang?”

A pause. “You’re kidding. You sang that old Leonard song, the one you overdid when you were sixteen and everyone forgave you because you were a child with terrible hair. And the other judge said—oh what did she say—‘I believe you more than I’ve believed anyone all season.’”

He let the words sit for a second. They seemed to want to sit.

“And you cried,” she added, laughing not at him but at the memory of the human, “which was not a surprise.”

“Don’t tell anyone,” he said. “I don’t want… I mean, maybe I’ll go and freeze. Maybe I’ll forget how to open my mouth.”

“You have a mouth. You’ll be fine. Call äiti—no, don’t call her yet. Let me. She’ll go into prayer mode and you know you can’t board a plane while someone is reciting vows at you over the phone.”

He reached for his coffee, put it down again. His hand was shaking.

On the train home that evening, the fields pretended at green and then changed their minds. Helsinki was all blunt light and thin shadows. He packed with the care he used for legal binders: suit, navy sweater, black jeans, dress shoes he’d bought for court but that had accidentally met a stage. In his drawer, under the thick socks and the notebook with his father’s old addresses, he found a single cufflink glittering up at him like an eye. He held it in his palm and for one breath saw a confetti storm and heard Seline Hart’s husky cackle, more intimate than TV.

He was aware of a gap. A valley that had been sketched in chalk. He did not know if it was new.

His mother called anyway, of course. Mothers moved faster than light. Petra’s voice had the crispness of someone who made soup for a living and believed in correct ways to do it.

“They said on the radio that the show had something unexpected this week,” she said. “Is it you? Marja says it’s you.”

“It is. It’s… it sounds ridiculous. But they want to fly me out. I need to—tell me to come home. Then I don’t have to go.”

“Come home,” she said, dutifully, and then after a beat, “But bring the trophy if they insist on giving it to you.”

He laughed, rubbed at the small scar on his wrist. He could never remember acquiring that either, only that it was always there when he looked for his watch.

“Don’t forget your passport. Don’t be polite when you should be brave. Sleep,” she told him. “And Eero?”

“Yes.”

“Sing. Sing for yourself.”

The Finnair flight hummed like something alive. He watched the cabin crew remind everyone that belts existed, watched the winter lifting away into a forgettable painting. London arrived like someone dropping a pizza box on a counter, all steam and noise. Maria’s assistant met him with a placard at Heathrow and hair the color of autumn. Kiran. “We loved your video,” Kiran said. “Your vowels. Sorry, that’s a weird thing to say.”

“My vowels,” Eero repeated, amused, wondering which vowels were his strongest. The ride into the city was a blur of brick and graffiti and his face doubled in the tinted glass. He could see a second him, and he had to admit he looked capable of choices.

The hotel was made to look more expensive than it was. It tried very hard with velvets. There were white lilies in the lobby that had given up trying not to be loud. He used his card to open a room that had already forgotten the last person to sleep there. On the desk was an envelope with his name handwritten by someone pretending to be casual. Inside were his schedule, song list options, a printed-out map to the studio, and a Polaroid picture of a stage at a dramatic angle, confetti frozen midthrow like weather.

The meeting with wardrobe happened under the flittering attention of a stylist named Gianni who was in love with dark blazers and with the idea of someone like Eero—serious, Northern, quiet until the not-quiet. “You’ll be the storm before the snow,” Gianni announced, pinning a hem that didn’t need pinning, smiling with fierce sincerity. “We won’t do tricks. We’ll let you stand and break hearts. Do you wear jewellery? No? A pity.”

The other finalists were shadows and then people. Rory, a blond boy from Manchester who said “sound” to mean everything good and would hug anything that didn’t bite. Ananya, sharp cheekbones and a lower register that made backstage go still. Mila, Ukrainian by way of Birmingham, with a laugh that cut the air into manageable shapes. They were kind to him in the way of people who knew what it meant to be on a cliff and to see other footprints there.

“So you’re the Finn,” Rory said. “I love your audition. We all watch each other’s stuff. Bit scary, innit?” There was ginger tea in his breath.

“It is,” Eero said. “But also—”

“Also you’d rather die than go back to normal life, yeah,” Mila finished, a bit wicked and a bit correct. “One weekend. Then either you go back to selling fish or you… I don’t know, live in airports for a year. Those are your two lives. What is your normal job?”

“Solicitor.”

They stared at him as if he had said astronaut. Then Ananya laughed, delighted. “You’re proper,” she said. “God help us all. What do you think of the contracts?”

“They are written by people who don’t intend to be contradicted,” he said absently, and was surprised at the shape of his own words when he heard them. Gareth Doyle, the producer, appeared just then like a coin you find in a pocket you hadn’t checked. He was handsome in the way of men who had been told for too long that the universe preferred them. He clapped Eero on the shoulder in a warm, weighty way.

“Our wildcard,” he said, the w in wildcard pronounced like an inside joke only he knew. “We’re grateful you said yes. The audience is starving. Give them something to live on.”

“I’ll try,” Eero said. He wanted to say, It’s your job to feed them, too. It felt disloyal to the feeling of the moment, so he didn’t.

The rehearsal came with its own sound of shoes and cables. The stage looked absurd up close, like a god had tried to build a toy for his children and gotten carried away. He stepped onto it and something in him went dim and then bright. The boards held him like a promise. He sang two lines to the empty seats, no mic, and even the lighting guy looked up.

“You’re a weirdo,” Gianni said, which he took as the necessary blessing it was.

There was a wall near the dressing rooms where framed photographs of past winners lined up like soldiers in a gentle war. Eero found himself drawn to it without meaning to be. A girl with a guitar, a trio dressed like expensive knives, a man whose teeth had their own agents. Then a blank. A narrow rectangle where a photograph had been removed, the glass still smudged. The small plaque underneath read: Last Year’s Winner. On hiatus.

He frowned. “Why would there be a blank?” he asked Kiran, who had appeared with a bottle of water as if by magic.

“Oh,” Kiran said too lightly. “The photo was damaged. And we—there were issues with the artwork clearances. Legal stuff. It will be back soon. Don’t worry, the ghost in the wall doesn’t bite.”

“Legal stuff,” Eero repeated, and an ache blossomed behind his eyes the size of a pulse. He had friends who would kill to draft these contracts. He had been one of those friends.

That night in the hotel he dreamed in film grain. He dreamed of standing with his hands open, palms up, as if waiting for rain. He dreamed of Seline Hart leaning forward at the judges’ table, not smiling. He dreamed his mother’s hands kneading dough, and the smell of burnt sugar. He woke at three with a word on his tongue that tasted like victory and he had no idea where he’d been to get it.

He got up. He made tea. He stood at the window and watched a man in a reflective jacket hose down the pavement across the street for no reason except that the pavement wanted to be different. In the mirror he looked like someone who might be believed.

The dress rehearsal the next day made everything small and large at the same time. Backstage was a town. People knew the names of people they’d never had dinner with. The floor manager had a voice that could move a herd of buffalo. “Five minutes!” she called. “Five! And no one daydreams on my watch!” Her name was Imogen. She called him, at one point, sweetie, then apologized in the next breath as if she’d committed a terrible professional crime.

He chose his song from the list Maria had sent with the quiet knowledge that if he thought too much about what anyone else would think of the choice, he’d be making a mistake. He picked something stripped, a melody so stuck into his bones that if someone startled him he’d sing it anyway. In the tiny room assigned to him he sang it into the wall, watched his breath fog the mirror. He wrote down, out of habit, arguments that he wanted to make in a memo he wasn’t currently writing, bullet points like anchors, because the act of breaking something complicated down into manageable pieces had saved him in court and in love and sometimes at the grocery store.

Seline Hart came to find him. She had hair like a legal warning and wrists like a dancer’s. On camera she was a beautiful storm; in the doorway she looked tired in the way that only the relentless look tired.

“Do you need anything?” she asked, and in her tone there were the undertones of someone who’d had to ask that question of too many children and too many grown adults pretending to be children.

“Confidence,” he said. He couldn’t help it. She made him want to be the kind of person who told the truth even when it was embarrassing.

She laughed, delighted, head thrown back, untelevised. “Darling. The secret is that no one has any. We borrow some from each other and give it back at the end of the day with the label twisted. You’re the Finn, yes?”

“Yes,” he said.

“You look familiar,” she said, almost to herself, and then shook her head as if shaking the thought out. “We’ll see what you do out there,” she said. “Make me believe something.”

He tried not to be superstitious but found himself tapping the small scar on his wrist with his thumb. It was a habit the way a path becomes a habit for deer.

When the day’s chaos had slowed enough to let him feel the edges of himself again, he went outside. Just the alley behind the building. Just air that belonged to no one. A man in a poorly tailored suit smoked a cigarette so optimistically it seemed like a prayer. Eero stepped into the grey and listened to London breathe from the throat.

The van was black, unlabelled, respectable in the way of expensive clocks. The men inside dressed like the denim ads, with beards that pretended to ruggedness at a salary. He didn’t register them as danger until one of them stepped forward with a smile that didn’t touch the eyes.

“Mr. Kallio? Production sent us,” the man said. “There’s a quick thing with the press, off-site, and then we’ll get you back for warm up. Ten minutes. Tops.”

He had learned to distrust the word quick in emails. But here the wind was cold and his jacket was wrong for it and he was supposed to show up and be obliging. He went one step forward. His phone buzzed in his pocket; he didn’t look at it.

“What’s this about?” he asked.

“Just a chat with the BBC. They want a few quotes. Finn in the final, that plays nice,” the man said, accent London with the bits sanded off. He held the van door open with a forearm muscled like he’d meant it.

He climbed in, because people do. He sat, because the body knows when it is supposed to sit. The door slid demon-quiet closed. His hand went to his pocket, to the phone, to text Maria, to text Kiran, to text someone. The second man, who had been quiet, put a hand gently over his. Nothing violent. Not yet. Firm enough to make the point.

“Don’t,” the man said. “Not yet.”

He stared. “Who are you?” he asked, as if these things began with names.

The van moved, like a conclusion. The glass was dark. The city rearranged itself outside into a series of uncertainties.

“We’re friends,” said the first man, amused by his own lies. “You sing for us later, yeah?”

The radio, as if directed by a god with a sense of humor and a taste for on-the-nose soundtracks, shifted tracks. A song wrapped itself in the cabin like a snake. He knew it before he knew that he knew it. He knew the breath the singer would take between the second and third line; he knew the trick in the bridge, the place where you slowed down just a hair to make everyone in the room remember they had hearts.

“That’s—” he began, and stopped because the word he was going to say was mine.

He closed his eyes and there it was: the stage less than a year old, his shoes digging into its memory, the wild brightness of confetti colonizing the air, and the way the applause ran through him like electricity looking for a place to ground. He saw his own mouth open; he saw Seline stand; he saw Gareth’s face, which was a different face when it didn’t know it was looking at a camera. He saw hands—hands he knew—pulling him backstage into a hug that felt like restraint. He saw a room with a couch that had swallowed a thousand nerves and a table with a contract on it, thicker than his wrist, and the way he had smoothed the top page with the thumb he was now tapping against his scar.

“I don’t sign this as written,” he had said in that room in some life. He heard his own voice as if the man in the van had said it; he heard himself cool and exact.

“Of course you don’t,” Gareth had said then, like a man who anticipates the weather and had packed three umbrellas. “We’ll talk, Eero. Tonight. But first let the cameras love you.”

Then a different kind of bright. Car lights cutting across a wet road. A noise like an argument that had forgotten the words. A hospital ceiling with dots like stars that grew cowardly as he stared at them. A woman’s voice asking him his name.

He opened his eyes because if he kept them closed he would go somewhere he might not return from. The van smelled like new car and someone’s cologne. The song on the radio ended without anyone dying of it, then repeated again as if time had become uncertain.

“What do you remember?” the quiet man asked unexpectedly, eyes on him. There was a kindness in it, small, a leaf.

“I remember…” he said, and had to swallow because the word choked him. He remembered his mother’s black coffee on a winter morning. He remembered the first time he saw London and believed in magic because some cities do that. He remembered the taste of panic the first time he had stood in court, the judge’s eyebrows like architecture. He remembered the feel of money, the paper kind, crisp and fresh from a printer. He remembered a song rolling under his tongue like thunder. He remembered confetti sticking to his cheek. He remembered.

He remembered winning.

He looked at the quiet man, who nodded once like someone acknowledging the inevitable weather.

“Good,” the man said, not unkindly. “Now we can have a proper conversation.”

They drove. He did not ask where, because where had become irrelevant; they were traveling further into the interior than geographical coordinates could hold. The city leaned in, listening as they vanished into it like a rumor.

The warehouse was in a part of London that had never cared what anyone called it. It had brick like teeth and a door like a memory. The van’s engine ticked down into silence. His body realized itself, heavy and capable and wanting to run. The door slid open and the air held him and then let him go.

Inside, the light had been stripped for parts. The men were not rough with him, not yet. They ushered him in as if entering a church. There was a table. There was a chair. There was a third man, older, with hair that had lost interest in obedience. He did not stand.

“Eero,” the third man said. “I’m sorry about the theatre of it all. Please. Sit.”

He did not sit, because obedience could be rationed. He stayed standing and straightened his cuff as if it mattered.

“Who are you,” he said, wearing each word like a separate suit.

“My name is Viktor. I’m… a fixer is what people call it. Untidy. I prefer translator. I translate between power and reality. You don’t need to know me. You do need to listen. I’m here to ask you a favor. It aligns with your interests.”

“My interests include not being put in a van,” Eero said. His voice surprised him. It had acquired a grain. He glanced at the door. He could get there, perhaps. He could make it to the night. He could also be a bandage on the floor. He calculated, because he had been trained to.

“We’re going to return you, don’t worry. You have rehearsals. We’re not monsters,” Viktor said. “But you’ve been walking around with a hole in your head. I suppose that’s impolite. In your memory.”

Eero’s hand found his wrist again. He didn’t stop it. “You’re saying—”

“I’m saying you won last year,” Viktor said simply, and it felt like someone putting a key into a lock inside a cupboard that had appeared behind him without permission. “You won, and then there were disagreements about the shape of the future. The label’s shape and yours. A car. A hospital. Convenient fog. A gap was built. You stepped into it. The machine moved on.”

“Why would they let me back?” he asked. He was impressed by the calm of his voice. He wanted to sit down suddenly. He didn’t.

“Because a good story is currency,” Viktor said. “Because the audience was restless. Because a Finn solicitor with a voice like a bruise is a headline. Because who would believe that reality is so lazy it repeats itself. Because the people who needed to be out of the building are out of the building now. Because they think they can get you to sign what they want you to sign if they spool the confetti again and make you hungry.”

Eero could hear his heart counting in another language. He felt the odd calm that came in court when the opposing counsel finished an argument and he could see where the holes were. He saw holes. He also saw the distance between what he knew and what he could prove. He thought of the blank on the wall.

“Why are you telling me this?” he asked.

“Because we are tired of the way they eat people,” Viktor said, almost gently. “And because we are not naïve enough to think we can stop the machine without getting on it. We want you to go out there and sing and let them love you. We want you to let them put a crown on your head again. And then we want you to say no.”

“Say no to what.”

“To the part of the contract that says you are theirs in perpetuity for pennies. To the clauses that bind you to perform in places that will break you, to say yes when they ask you to sing at their parties for men who call you ‘that one.’ To the gag. We want you to use the stupid brightness against the dark.”

Eero’s ears felt like he had been underwater too long. He thought of himself at eighteen, watching the show with his father on the sticky brown couch and laughing at the bad auditions until the one boy opened his mouth and they had both gone silent. He thought of a hospital ceiling with dot-patterns and a woman’s voice asking him his name and the way his mouth had to think about the words it was supposed to contain.

“You’re asking me to torpedo my chances,” he said.

“I’m asking you to remember that you don’t need chances. You already won. It’s a loop. It’s a trick. This time you can break it.”

The quiet man—he would later learn his name, Tom—stepped forward with a small bottle of water, offering it. He took it without looking down. He opened it and drank and the water didn’t seem to have taste. He thought of his client in Helsinki who had signed away his company for the comfort of a thick cheque and then watched as his name disappeared from the sign above the door. He had lost his appetite that day. He had thought, with heat, I will be a better lawyer than this. I will keep something for them that is not ruined.

“What if I want it,” he said, a smallness in the words, a truth he could not expel. “The machine. The flights. The handshake in airport lounges. The album in a window. What if I want to walk down a street and have somebody know me enough to smile.”

“Then we are the wrong ghosts,” Viktor said, no condemnation in it. “But think about who is smiling. Think about whether it is for you. And think about your mother saying prayers at the phone. Does she want that smile for you? Does your sister?”

He pictured Petra stirring soup, Marja taking a break at four a.m. to sit on a plastic chair and look at a photograph of a lake on her phone like it could be a window. He pictured his father, who had once gotten in his car and driven north until he thought of something he’d forgotten to apologize for and then turned around and never said what it was.

The van ride back to the studio was a lesson in how quickly a city can forget your absence. The doors opened; the same man in the reflective jacket was now leaning against a wall looking like someone who never moved. Eero stepped back into the apparatus of the day as if he had gone to buy gum. Kiran rushed toward him with a lanyard, relief disguised as annoyance.

“Where did you go? Gareth was looking for you. You can’t just disappear, you know. I have to herd these cats and you and your vowels complicate everything.”

“Sorry,” he said, and added, because he wanted to set a flag somewhere familiar, “Traffic.”

“London,” Kiran said, rolling eyes, forgiven at the speed of light.

On the stage, while a tech he did not know taped a small square of black to mark his place to stand, he hummed the first line of the song that had introduced him to himself twice. His mouth opened. The word victory hovered like a joke someone had told earlier and he had finally gotten. Seline watched from the stalls, her chin on her hand, her mouth not quite smiling, as if something in the air had shifted a degree and she was waiting to see if the weather had changed or if it was only the lighting.

He sang and the sound belonged to him and also to the room and also to whoever he had been when confetti had taught him how heavy joy can be. And as the note rang, a thought as simple as a glass of water: I am last year’s winner. I forgot. They made sure I forgot. And now I remember. And now, because famously you cannot fit the same river in your hands twice, everything might be different.

Backstage again the wall of winners grinned their teeth at him. The blank pulsed. He touched the glass and imagined, for half a second, his own face appearing in it, twice, one after the other like a glitch in a video no one had edited carefully enough. He smiled at the idea, in spite of himself, and then at the part of the thought that had learned to be brave in quiet ways.

“Ready?” Imogen barked, because barking was how she loved.

“Yes,” he said, and it sounded like an answer to more than one question.They gave him a number to wear that meant nothing and everything. The laminate hung heavy on a lanyard that had brushed the necks of three other men that day; Eero could feel the warmth it carried from an hour ago, someone else’s pulse. Imogen ushered, Maria materialized out of corners, Gianni hovered like a purposeful moth, and the afternoon bent itself into evening so efficiently it seemed rehearsed. He found himself in the corridor with the old paint and the new posters, the photographs that explained a lineage somebody wanted you to believe in, the blank rectangle that explained something else.

Maria had the smile of someone who had learned to make a smile do complex work. It softened when they were alone in a narrow space with a machine dispensing water that tasted like the inside of aluminum. “How are you, really?” she asked, lowering her voice as if that made the question a confession rather than an intrusion. “I know we’ve thrown you into a fire and asked you to dance.”

“I can do one of those,” he said. He did not tell her about the van, about the warehouse with air that sat differently in his lungs, about Viktor’s hands folded politely over a table that had been wiped too many times with a cloth that had absorbed too much. He watched her watching him, saw in her quick eyes a kindness that had not been entirely professionalized out of her. He had learned to be wary of kindness that worked for institutions, but he catalogued it anyway as something human.

“Press wants five minutes for B-roll and then a sit-down. PR has some talking points. We can adjust if you don’t feel comfortable,” she said, and there it was, the word he had been told Seline had said to him in another life. He wanted to ask if Maria had been here last year when the confetti had insisted on existing for longer than confetti is supposed to exist. He wanted to ask if she had written the email that asked him to go back to his regular life. He wanted, absurdly, to ask her if she believed in the concept of fairness in an industry that paid lip service to it with ponies and cakes and then laughed at the mess. Instead he nodded and let her shepherd him into a room that had a sofa shaped like a lie about comfort.

Two PR women, one with a haircut that could cut paper, one with a notepad that looked like it had been brought to life by a spell, greeted him as if he were a talent and not a complication. “Eero! Great to have you,” Haircut said, her vowels clipped at the corners in a way that made him think of efficient knives. “So, your story. We want to lean into your background, obviously. The solicitor angle is brilliant. Finns are huge with our 35-54 bracket. Snow, sincerity, we can make that sing. We’ll avoid anything that feels… old-fashioned tragic. We want hope. We want, ‘he chose a stable life but music chose him.’ Lovely.”

“Which is true,” he said, aware of the layers of truth the way you are when you choose which suit to wear. “Except for the parts where it isn’t.”

“Everything’s true if you say it with conviction and then move on,” Notepad said, scribbling. “Questions about song choice: if we get asked, we say it was a mutual decision with the team. Wardrobe: minimalist, Northern noir. If asked about nerves, we joke. If asked about competition, we support. We don’t say names. We never say names.”

He obeyed because it cost him nothing to obey here. They filmed him nodding in the slow, significant way they would cut into thirty seconds of him walking in slow motion down a corridor with lights that had been made to be flattering and had instead made everyone look like a glamorous avocado. He said things that were true enough that he didn’t taste metal after. He said he was grateful. He said he was excited. He did not say that he had set a small trap for a man he had once thought he could admire.

Gareth had asked to see him, which was phrased as a gift. His room had a couch that had survived too many anxious bodies, a tray with strawberries pretending to be generous, and a carafe of water wearing ice like jewelry. The producer stood, smiled a smile that had won battles, and offered his hand as if Eero had not seen that hand on another day like a weapon. He shook it because he wanted Gareth to feel the texture of his calm.

“We’re thrilled you’re here,” Gareth said. “I don’t say that to everyone. It’s the final; we need narrative oxygen, not just voices. You give us both. How are you settling? London behaving? You need anything—eye mask, candles, whatever Gianni hasn’t already thrown at you?”

“I have what I need,” Eero said. He kept his voice easy. It came to him easily, which was either a sign of talent or of something else having shifted finally into a place that would hold. He sat when invited. He crossed an ankle over a knee the way men do when they want to look like they belong.

“Good.” Gareth poured water like he was anointed to do it. “Look, candidly, you’re not here by accident. The clip from your audition has a life of its own; the internet loves you. You walked away in a powerful way. Now you’re back when we needed a hero. Don’t blush, it’s true. People want to believe in the idea that they get second chances. You’re a gift. We’ll do right by you. We’ll keep you safe.”

The words scraped him like the inside of a seashell. He smiled robustly enough to be mistaken for charmed. “I appreciate your concern,” he said. “I’m a lawyer. I know the taste of it.”

“Then you’ll understand we’ve updated the standard documentation since you were last in the building,” Gareth said, dropping the sentence as if it were an apple he didn’t want. He gestured and a woman with a waterfall of hair and immaculate nails materialized from the anteroom with a folder thick enough to prop a door. “No major changes. Just good governance. We’ll clean signatures after the show; for now Legal wants to know you’ve seen the shape of what we’ll be discussing. Keeps everyone honest.”

He took the folder because he had been handed a thousand like it and because the smell of ink was a smell that talked to him in his sleep. The top sheet was branding and nonsense; he turned it and turned the next, scanning with the speed of a profession built around not missing the single sentence that would undo a life. The mechanical whir of his reading calmed him in a way that music did not, a reminder that he could still decide.

There it was, on page seven, language that had been designed to be looked at by the tired, to be accepted by the hungry, to be quoted cheerfully in press releases and misremembered. “In perpetuity throughout the universe” was a phrase that still made him want to laugh and then bite someone. The “morals” clause was a net. The exclusivity provisions were a cage dressed up as a glass house. He did not find the exact place where they would own not just his masters but his face in certain contexts for a period of time defined by an algebra that amounted to “whenever we feel like it,” but he knew where it would be hiding if he ran his finger down two more pages.

The interesting change was newer footnotes he didn’t remember seeing when he had dreamed his way into that room last time like a man being crowned. “Artist agrees to waive any claims arising from past engagements with the Company and/or Affiliates, including but not limited to any claims relating to personal injury, mental distress, memory impairment, reputational harm…” The words stepped lightly and then placed their full weight when you weren’t looking. He could feel Gareth watching him not reading but building a case.

Eero turned the pages back to the top calmly and set the folder on the table with the cover perfectly aligned with the edge. “We’ll talk,” he said, the same words Gareth had given him in the room that had smelled of victory and fruit. “I’ll want my counsel. We can email from Helsinki or London. I won’t sign tonight.”

“Of course,” Gareth said, fond, as if being managed gently by someone who clearly did not understand the game. His smile did a subtler thing. “Let’s get you through the show. Let the public tell us what’s possible. Then we’ll have all the leverage we need, together. You and me.”

“Do you ever think about who ‘us’ is when you say it?” Eero asked in a tone like he was asking for a pen. “Who is together. Who is the public. Who belongs to the lever.”

Gareth’s eyes did a quick thing, an electric reading of risk and reward. He laughed like a friendly elevator. “I think about television,” he said. “I think about the bit that makes them cry, and the bit that makes them text in. I think about stories that make our mothers call us.”

“So we’re aligned,” Eero said, standing so that the conversation had to stand with him. “Thank you for the strawberries.”

He left with the folder in his hand because it looked like work and because he wanted to carry something that was heavier than air. In the corridor he nearly walked into Seline. Up close her perfume was old-fashioned in the way of women who knew what used to be beautiful and had refused to be told that it wasn’t anymore. Her mouth tilted. She touched his sleeve, and the gesture was the same generous economy as the way she moved on stage.

“They’ll try to make you a montage,” she said, too low for the corridor to catch. “Don’t let them.”

“I’m a lawyer,” he said, realizing how absurd that phrase had become on his tongue, like a magic spell he had been given without instructions. “I can slice film.”

“You looked different last time,” she said, and the last time was sudden, alive, in the skin around her eyes. “There was too much light. It made everyone loud. You went quiet when you should have gone loud and then something went offstage and we were told… we were told something I did not believe. We don’t have to be friends. You don’t owe me kindness. But I am angry on your behalf in a way I don’t have time to perform. Do you understand?”

“I do,” he said, and then, because he owed her a kind of honesty he did not owe Gareth, “They took me for a drive. They told me I won last year. My body knew before my head did. I have fragments. I have a gap. I have to decide what I will fill it with.”

Her breath left her in an indelicate snort that television would have edited out. “Use us,” she said. “Not the way they mean it. Use the chair, use my jewelry, use my red lipstick, use the cameras. They can’t put the glitter back in the tube once you say a thing into a microphone. Just make sure you want to live with what you say.”

“How did you live with it?” he asked, surprising himself. He had watched her through three marriages and one confession of a drinking problem that had been contorted by tabloids until it no longer resembled a human admission. He had watched her drop the judges’ smiles sometimes like weapons and sometimes like apologies.

“I built a house out of women who owe no one anything,” she said, and her laugh wasn’t tired now, it was something gleaming and sharp. “And I pay them. Go warm up. Leave your clever for after the song.”

He did what she told him, because he liked being told what to do when the person issuing orders did not pretend it was because of love. In his room the cufflink he had found in Helsinki sat on the desk where he had set it down earlier like a talisman. Gianni swept in with a box as if he had scented sacred jewelry. The stylist opened it with an operatic flourish and Eero breathed in the faint tarnish and cologne of old metal.

“Your hands,” Gianni said, taking one like a fortune teller, turning his wrist gently, his thumb brushing over the small scar as if it were a note in a song that only he could hear. “This,” Gianni said, not asking. He pulled out a pair of cufflinks that caught the light with a subdued arrogance. One was a twin to the one Eero had brought from home, and the sight of it was a bell rung inside his bones. “We found this in last year’s rental. No one claimed. I kept it for when we needed to make a man out of lightning. Do you mind?”

“Not at all,” Eero said. He felt his breath rearrange itself in his chest. “Thank you.”

Gianni’s smile was the grin of a man who had been vindicated by the gods of a very specific church. “The storm before the snow,” he reminded the room, which might have been eavesdropping. “Don’t apologize. Ever. Not even with your face.”

He texted his sister from the corner by the window while people made decisions about the line of his jacket with pins that looked like dangerous insects. He told her a version of the day that ached with restraint, then added one sentence that reached out like a hand across the Baltic. I think I won last year, he wrote, and his thumb hovered and then committed, and the blue dots that meant a life elsewhere read him and thought.

Marja called within three minutes, which was either sisterhood or an ambulatory refusal to be contained by a work schedule. Her voice carried a night shift’s steel in it. “Say that again slowly,” she demanded, and he did, not sparing her the strangeness because if he had learned anything from Petra it was that pretending a thing isn’t happening makes it happen harder. She did not gasp. She swore softly in a way that would have made Petra throw a tea towel. She listened the way nurses do, which is to say she sorted and she triaged and she decided. “So. You have two jobs now. Sing better than you have ever sung. And don’t sign a single thing without sending it to me so I can Google every word like a lunatic. Also, do you want me to call a journalist? The cousin of a friend’s boyfriend works at Yle.”

“Not yet,” he said, thinking of the shape of defamation here, of the way truth protects in one jurisdiction and fails you in another, of the way a microphone emboldens and betrays. “I need to make them say certain things out loud where someone else can hear them. I need to say certain things that aren’t accusations and will still cut. I need to make it irreversible.”

“You always wanted to set the table for your surprises,” she said, fond and exasperated in the way that had raised him. “Wear something warm. London pretends it isn’t cold and then gives you a cold you can name. Don’t faint. Hydrate. I love you even when you’re insufferable. Tell äiti after the show. Or I will. Don’t you dare go quiet if they try to make you small.”

“I won’t,” he said, and the promise landed in him like something that had been waiting for a landing strip.

By the time the audience was allowed in, oxygen changed shape. The seats filled with coats that had seen rain and trains, with people who had found the money for this in a pocket they hadn’t believed had money in it, with teenagers vibrating like tuning forks, with husbands who weren’t sure how they had been convinced to be here and would later tell their friends with surprising sincerity that they had seen something. The warm-up comic did the necessary racist dance of trying to be sufficiently chaotic and sufficiently safe; Eero watched him bless the room with confirmation that laughter was possible. A camera walked by on a crane like a friendly dinosaur. Music did the work of convincing everyone that what they were about to feel had been invented especially for them.

They filmed the pre-roll for his segment in a cold corner where somebody had thought a ficus might make life feel less like a warehouse. He said into the lens that he had grown up in a kitchen. He said his mother had hands that could convince an egg to behave. He said law had saved him and singing had let him be honest about the reasons he needed saving. He watched the field producer nod, saw her see the edit even as he was speaking, the cut to the old clip of him in a cheap jacket making a room behave, the cut to him walking into a courtroom like he lived there, the cut to him now, pupils blown, collar discreetly rebellious. He spoke into the small red light as if it were a person who had misunderstood him once and who he could forgive.

His phone buzzed once in his pocket with a number that called itself nothing. He took it out when he was alone by a stack of pelican cases and saw a link that was a sentence with its vowels removed. A file loaded fast even on the treacherous backstage Wi-Fi because whoever had sent it knew the choreography of such places. Medical paperwork scrolled past, names black-barred except for his, whose sly vowels and steady consonants looked strange alongside terms that tried and failed not to be melodramatic. “Retrograde amnesia,” wrote a doctor who had used a pen that wanted to impress. “Post-traumatic,” suggested someone else who had probably wanted to nap. An insurance claim denied, appealed, accepted. A non-disclosure with the same font as Gareth’s comfort. A signed acknowledgement of receipt of payment for “care and travel disruption.” A redacted report with the shape of his accident visible around the edges like a chalk outline around a lie. He felt his lips move around syllables he didn’t say out loud. He saved the file in three places his phone was willing to grant him.

Backstage, Ananya had her headphones around her neck and a look on her face like she was remembering an argument she had won. “You look like you’re about to commit a crime,” she said, amused and affectionate as the world’s end approached.

“Only a misdemeanor,” he said. “You?”

“Felony,” she said confidently, which was consistent with her cheekbones. “My grandmother is watching from Wolverhampton with six women who all think they’re my manager. Don’t do anything that makes them think you’re not nice. They will find you in Helsinki.”

“I would like to be found by six Wolverhampton women at least once in my life,” he said. Rory whooped, bouncing as if defying gravity were a hobby. Mila pressed her cold hands to her cheeks and said a prayer in a language that sounded like the beginning of a storm. They were all between the ages of almost ruined and almost invincible. He felt protective of them and also aligned with them in the way soldiers are protective of and aligned with anyone who has chosen the wrong war on purpose.

“Places,” Imogen called, and voice did the shepherding thing it had practiced. The floor itself seemed to hum toward readiness. Technicians became shadows with purpose. The countdown did what it always did: it convinced your body that time was a thing that could be held.

He stood in the wings, and the wings were not just curtains and rigging but a place where a person became the thing they were about to be. He could see the empty dark where the cameras would live; he could see the boxy forms of the judges at their desk, the smile already placed on Seline’s face that meant people would let her stab them with it if she needed to. He could see Gareth, shameless as a statue, talking to a man in a headset as if he were telling him a joke. He could feel Viktor somewhere, not in the room but somewhere like gravity is somewhere, unseeable but stubborn. He could feel Tom’s quiet gaze. He felt, most astonishingly, himself.

The host said his name in the voice that made everything sound like it was happening in a universe that was slightly better designed than the one people endured outside. They cut to his pre-roll. He watched himself on the monitor be tenderly epic. The swell of strings was a kind of lie and also a kindness. He wondered with new gentleness how many lives are rescued by lies that do their job correctly.

When he walked out, the sound of the room rose and met him with the hunger he had been promised. It was not a wave; it was a weather front moving in with purpose. The floor had given its right answer to Gianni’s shoes. The microphone was the weight of a small story. He placed his hands where Gianni had told him to place them because ritual can be a raft. The lights did what they had been built to do and threw him into a kind of day he wouldn’t have recognized as belonging to any planet.

He sang the first line with care and then the second with less care than was safe. It was the song he had chosen because it belonged to him even when he wasn’t singing. He refused to gild it. He refused to perform despair the way television teaches you to. He wore the song like a coat in an old photograph. When he reached the bridge he remembered the trick he had remembered in the van—the almost imperceptible slowing that made people in the room look down at their hands in order to pretend they had not just been hit with news. He did it and the room complied and made the small sound of surrender that a thousand microphones do not catch, the quiet oh of people who have been ambushed by their own interior lives.

Halfway through he forgot he had ever been told what to be. His voice did something he had not asked for and he let it. He did not cry. He obeyed Petra for once and sang for himself because he had been told to and because he had promised a woman with rings that could have been weapons that he would live with what he said. He finished soft, because finishing loud would have been an apology and he had been instructed by a man who believed in storms not to apologize.

The room rose at him, which is to say people stood and made their bodies into proof, and applause made thunder small. He looked, involuntarily, at Seline, because he had given her the assignment of deciding whether he had told a truth. She had her hands pressed together in front of her mouth, a gesture that might have been prayer and might have been a desire to grab someone by the lapels. Gareth clapped with his mouth, as was his style, an artful O of appreciation, his hands clean of anything so clumsy as enthusiasm.

When she talked, Seline did the strange alchemy she could do where she made television feel like two human beings in a kitchen. “You don’t sound like anyone here,” she said, and it was a blessing and also a surgical report. “You sound like the person who taught you to sing spoke softly and you listened. You stand like the floor is your friend. You took a song that belongs to people and you made it only yours and somehow none of us minded. I… believe you. Which is an indulgence I’m not supposed to take too often. Don’t get accustomed. Do it again.”

The other judge—Ray, who had built his bones in a boy band and now dispensed wisdom like a man who had learned the price of it—talked about control and about vowels and about Finland being welcome here, and the words slid off and stuck enough to satisfy television. Mila watched him from the wings with her eyes wet and a resolve in her chin. Rory slapped something with joy and then apologized to it. Ananya nodded along, approving his felony level.

They threw to commercial, which is to say they handed his moment away for money, and he told himself that even revolutions require revenue. Backstage, a runner pressed a bottle of water into his hand as if handing him a consolation. Maria’s expression was a fraction too bright, the way people look when they are glad and also thinking of things that might ruin them. She squeezed his arm in a moment so quick he might have imagined it. “You did that,” she said, which doubled as praise and assignment.

Between segments, a runner had him climb the steps to the judges’ desk to receive the ritual banalities, the handshake that made the audience feel as if they had participated in something, the little moment where Seline leaned in and said, out of the corner of her mouth and the corner of their lives, “If you plan to pull anything do it with nouns, not adjectives.” He met her eyes, understood, and filed away one last grammar lesson in a life full of them.

After they sent him away to let other people try to make the night theirs, he found a quiet that the building hadn’t sanctioned. It was a supply cupboard with a mop that had given up, and it smelled like lemon and effort. He called the quiet number because he had been given it and because he did not intend to be a pawn without also being a player. Tom answered with the same small kindness in his voice, and Eero told him where the file had landed and what it contained and what he intended. He spoke in small clauses stacked neatly like a closing argument he was not licensed to make in this jurisdiction. He told Tom the sentence he could say on television that would be true and also not get him sued before dessert.

“We can’t stop the broadcast,” Tom said. “Obviously. We’re not magicians. But we can put ears in places where ears haven’t been. Are you sure you want the mess? You’ll get support. You’ll also be… a storm. You know what storms do.”

“It’s in my wardrobe brief,” Eero said, unbelievably calm and a little surprised at himself. “I’ve always been weather. I am tired of pretending I’m a roof.”

“Then we’ll stand in the rain with you,” Tom said, and the sentence carried the weight of men who had done that and not been sorry.

They stacked the show like a buffet and moved plates down it. He watched the others devour their slots. He made himself small backstage, becoming inventory. He thought about what he could say that would be specifically a statement and not a threat. He thought about the law like a language and about the ways to pronounce certain vowels so that power heard manners and not intent. He thought about Petra and Marja sitting at the table that had learned to hold grief and laughter at the same time. He put his hand to his wrist and tapped twice, a habit that had become a plan.

When they called everyone back out for the end-of-hour chatter, the bit with the confetti and the tease of greater confetti, he let himself be arranged in the row like candles on a cake. The host made them laugh. The cameras sought faces that would be good clips for later if anything spectacularly unprofessional happened. Gareth stood just where the camera could catch him in the background being important. Seline twisted a ring that could have written a treaty.

The host asked him the question that had been scripted: “How are you feeling stepping into this extraordinary situation? What a whirlwind, eh?” He had three options he had been given, and none of them fit. He chose the fourth one, which was the arrangement of words he had built in the cupboard with lemon-scented resolve. He breathed. He thought of nouns. He held the microphone like a tool and not like a child.

“I feel grateful for the chance to sing,” he said, allowing warmth because it was true, and the audience applauded the platitude on cue. “I feel proud to be next to these people who are brave in public.” The camera loved Ananya’s tiny bow and soap-operatic eye roll. “And I feel a responsibility, as a lawyer and as a person who reads before he signs, to say this to anyone watching who sings in their kitchen and comes here to make a life with their voice: read the contracts you are given. Ask for time. Ask for counsel. Don’t let anyone make you agree that your future belongs to them forever, not even if they have confetti. ‘In perpetuity throughout the universe’ sounds like a joke, but it is not. It has hands. Keep that for yourself, please, if you can.”

There was a funny noise then, the sound a room makes when it realizes that the television has forgotten to be television and started being a place. It wasn’t silence and it wasn’t a gasp. It was a kind of attention you only get when a thousand strangers have decided you’ve just said something they are allowed to feel strongly about. He had put no accusation in the sentence and all of the warning. He had attached it to his own profession like a parachute. He had given them nouns. The host blinked four times in one second like a robot recalibrating. The producers yelled softly into the headsets of people who were already doing the thing they had been told to do if someone unhelpfully told the truth out loud.

Seline’s mouth did a small, beautiful approval. Gareth’s jaw did a lonely, furious thing like a man who has had someone else put a spoon into his soup. The audience did not understand the details but understood that they had been invited to peek under a tablecloth and had seen that the table had legs, and that was enough to make them feel like accomplices.

They rolled into the next segment because you cannot pause live television without teaching it to bleed. The night had to pretend to be normal again. Eero let it, smiling the kind of harmless smile that makes you untouchable for another five minutes. Backstage, Kiran grabbed his elbow with fingers that were trying not to shake.

“Was that on a card?” Kiran demanded, and then let go because training had kicked in. “Because if that was off-card I’m supposed to tell you you can’t do that. But also it was… sexy, which is a gross word. And you said perpetuity and my aunt at home is probably Googling it and I love you as a concept.”

“I didn’t name anyone,” Eero said mildly, which is the sort of thing one says before reluctantly hiring a bodyguard or a PR firm, and Kiran laughed and moved him along as if laughter were armor.

He found a corner to stand in where the light did not reach as eagerly. He let himself shake for a small private electric moment and then made it stop because he had used his allowed tremor for the hour. He felt something uncoil and stretch inside him like a cat that had been asleep for a year. Somewhere in the building a radio played low under the noise of work and lives. The song that came through had his name on it, whether or not anyone else in that corridor could read. He closed his eyes because the inside of his own head had finally become a place he could be alone without being abandoned.

Later, much later, after results and tears and the tattoo of applause and someone dropping a tray and the way every after smells like hairspray and relief, after the orchestrated camera shots of judges walking majestically away to their cars as if they were being called back to Olympus, after the dressing down of a runner who had done nothing wrong, after the cameras had been powered down and the lights had been deliberately made less godlike, Gareth waited for him with the weight of a man who has calculated the cost of not owning something and decided he hates arithmetic. He smiled without moving his mouth much and said his name the way people do before they ask you to teach them how to stop bleeding.

“We’ll talk in the morning,” Gareth said, and it was as if the sentence required someone to translate it. “Congratulations. Or whatever the correct word is when a person decides to become interesting on air.”

“Good night,” Eero said, courteous, because he had discovered he enjoyed being courteous to people who did not understand the weaponry of it. He did not offer his hand. He adjusted his cuff and saw the old metal catch the tired light, and for a second he could smell snow without it being a metaphor. He did not know if he would sleep. He knew the city would, poorly. He knew his mother would boil water and pour it into a cup for a son who wasn’t in the room to drink it. He knew his sister would text him photographs of their lake at absurd hours as if it were a cure.

He walked out of the building without being put in a van. The air had a clean dullness to it, like someone had ironed it. The reflective-jacket man from the morning was still there, or there again, leaning like work was something you could lean on. A fox crossed the road where no fox could possibly belong and looked at him as if to evaluate whether he had learned anything. He raised a hand in a greeting that might have been a wave and might have been a promise. The city did not answer, but it made room for him to pass.Chapter 4

The morning didn’t so much arrive as set itself down. London light at eight looked like linen that had been washed too many times, thin but stubborn. Eero lay flat and let the ceiling tell him nothing for a while, then got up because bodies are engines and engines need fuel, even if fuel was a hotel kettle making water taste vaguely of previous tea drinkers. He texted Marja a photograph of the cufflink lying on the desk like a coin that had opinions. She replied with a picture of the lake, grey and immense, a slice of horizon like a ruled line, and wrote, Proud of you, even though pride is for idiots. Petra had sent a message composed as if she were dictating to a clerk: We shouted. The cat did not approve. Eat breakfast. Do not let anyone make you smaller than your coat. There was a soup emoji that made him laugh enough to spill his coffee.

He went downstairs and the lobby had found three new accents since last night and a smell of lilies that had been turned up as if someone could adjust it. A middle-aged couple in matching puffer jackets stared at him with the look of people trying to place a celebrity at the grocery store. The woman approached with the politeness of witnessed television. “Are you… from the show?” she asked, lowering her voice as if television were contagious. He nodded, smiled, watched relief and delight rearrange her face. “We loved the way you said perpetuity,” she added, and he had to bite his mouth to keep the grin from revealing too much of his teeth. The word was a small animal now, domesticated, being petted by strangers who had never considered that a contract might be able to walk into a room and steal the silver.

Outside, the air put a hand on his chest and kept it there, not unfriendly. He walked without thinking about destination because sometimes the act of moving shakes the stuck thoughts loose like change in a pocket. A fox rinsed itself along a hedge and regarded him as if he were a headline. The city did its morning: buses insisting; bicycles negotiating; a man hauling a bag of bread large enough to feed a choir or a small army; a woman in a coat that had calculated its cost per wear to the point of sainthood. He stood on a small bridge that pretended to span something grand and watched brown water busy itself. The song that had arrived with him from the van pressed against the inside of his tongue like a child who knows you have sweets in your pocket. He leaned on the railing and let himself hum the melody and then let his mouth leave it behind.

At a cafe that had decided to be honest about its croissants, he found Tom already seated with a newspaper open as camouflage and a coffee that had stopped being enjoyable and started being necessary. It wasn’t the kind of place men in denim and half-true beards would choose for kidnapping, which he appreciated. Tom looked like he could be folded into any day. He nodded once, allowed the small recognition to do its modest work, and slid across a seat where a button had gone missing. “Viktor wanted to come but he’s allergic to mornings,” Tom said, and Eero believed him in spite of Viktor’s careful-man energy. “Also, you are safer with fewer names in this for now.”

“Safer is relative,” Eero said. He warmed his hands around a cup and let it remind his veins of a purpose. “How much trouble am I in?”

Tom smiled the way people do who have seen trouble enough to classify it. “You didn’t libel anyone. You didn’t impugn a specific contract. You offered general consumer advice with a legal basis. Twitter will scream and then get distracted by a dog wearing shoes. In-house will draft emails with terms like protocol and brand safety. Gareth will tell someone he’s not worried very loudly. Someone else will be very worried very quietly. The valuable trouble is the kind that changes habits. You nudged a habit. That’s all. For now.”

He had brought the folder because he didn’t want to leave it in his room where housekeeping might tidy it into a shape that wasn’t a shape. He spread it open and touched the clause he had put his finger on last night as if it were a bruise he wanted to catalog. “This,” he said, because nouns. “The waiver. The way they tucked medical words into an entertainment contract like a needle into a fruit bowl. If they had nothing to protect, they wouldn’t need this language.”

Tom leaned over with the unshowy intimacy of men looking at something they intend to disarm. “Our friends in the software underworld pulled more. Hospital logs. Ambulance times. Traffic cameras going offline on a street where traffic cameras don’t go offline. The shape of a story you’ve already started to tell yourself even if you haven’t decided which ending you think is true. There’s a lawyer we trust—Amaya Patel. Media, defamation, contracts, the kind of person who speaks in parentheticals until she needs to cut and then uses single-syllable words. Talk to her before you see Legal. We’ll cover her time. Don’t pay us back. Consider it a tithe to whatever god watches the parts of the world that think they’re immune to prayer.”

He wrote the name down like students do when they know there will be an exam. The memory that had come back in the van still rode like heat at the edges of his field of vision. Sometimes he could pretend it had always been there. Sometimes if he turned too quickly it slipped to the corner of the room and waited politely for him to catch up. “Do you think he—” he began, then stopped because he had promised himself not to accuse until he had the paperwork that made accusation a profession and not a sport.

“I think men like that don’t need to push to get things to fall,” Tom said, like patience was a kind of weapon he had trained with. “I think inertia is their friend. I think he’ll smile at you today like he’s always smiled and he’ll slide something at you that smells of fruit and victory and he will be disappointed in you when you say you’ll read it. And I think if he took you last year from one room to another he believed the two rooms belonged to him. That’s as close as I can come to belief.”

“Belief is expensive,” Eero said. He looked out at the city pretending to be humble and decided that the next time he wanted to be somewhere that wasn’t a building he would find water that didn’t have bridges all over it. “I’m going to sing an original,” he added, the same way one tells a friend about an impulsive haircut after the first chunk of hair is already on the floor. “Tonight. They’ll hate it. But if I stamp something with my name before we finish this dance, I get a kind of ownership that doesn’t require their signature. I’ll register it. I’ll email a copy to myself. I’ll send it to my sister, which is another kind of registry no court can ignore.”

Tom laughed then, not to be polite. “Write faster than they can panic,” he advised. “Send me a copy and I’ll do the admin in places the show doesn’t own. Amaya will send you a clean template for an assignment so they can’t bully you into giving away more of it than a show fairly owns. And get some protein. You look like you ate nerves for dinner.”

He ate an egg that pretended to be heroic. He wrote lyrics on the back of a receipt until he couldn’t stand the ink smudge on his hand, then transferred them into his phone, then into a notebook because paper made him feel like he had weathered more storms than he had. The words did not arrive like soldiers in lines. They came like fugitives, in twos and threes, panting, demanding water. He had not written a song in a year. He had not had a year. He found a melody that stepped carefully and then misbehaved. He sent a voice memo to a person in Helsinki who had once played lap steel in a bar that had sold only light and cigarettes and received back within ten minutes a small halo of harmony like a promise.

When he arrived at the studio, the building was already awake enough to be tired. A young man with a headset on too tight looked at him as if seeing him made him late. Imogen materialized from behind a foam wall with a clipboard like a shield. “You have press in ten,” she said. “Then Legal in twenty. Then hair. Then your soul might be collected at four; we haven’t confirmed.”

“Add one thing, please,” he said, stepping into the pocket of her authority like a man ducking under a door frame he now knew was there. “Amaya Patel at two, in person or by call. Production can seat her anywhere they like as long as she hears me say the words I’ll be saying to Legal. I’m certain this won’t be a problem.”

Imogen’s eyes did a calculation she didn’t let the rest of her face participate in. “Copy,” she said, with the small grim smile of someone who enjoys adding complications to systems that had thought themselves sealed. “I’ll put out an extra chair and label it Destiny if anyone complains.”

Maria intercepted him in a corridor with a thousand posters and a thousand smiles. Today she had applied a shade of lipstick that declared war against being mistaken for the kind of woman who simply carried clipboards. She pulled him into a nook shaped like a tactical error and touched his sleeve as if checking the fabric’s willingness to be on television. “That was quite a sermon last night,” she murmured, for him and the ficus and the three laminated safety notices. “We’ve had emails. We’ve had calls. We’ve had someone’s aunt threaten to blog. Gareth will be gracious until he doesn’t know what gracious is anymore. Be careful. You’re not the first person to tell the truth in this building. They know how to turn truth into content and then eat it.”

“Are you angry?” he asked, because he had been taught to look for the person under the job and because Maria made it too easy not to.

“I’m tired,” she said, and the word was a woman in its own right, middle-aged, clever, carrying groceries up stairs. “I would like to work in a place where talent is not a harvest. I would like my job to be useful in ways that don’t make me want to wash my hands. I am good at making the story turn in the right places. I would like the story to hasten something besides ad sales. So perhaps I’m on your side, though that’s sloppy of me professionally. Also, my mother texted me ‘perpetuity!!!’ at two a.m. and then sent me a picture of me at five wearing a tutu. I resent you for this more than is reasonable.”

He laughed because the room needed it. “I’ll plan fewer revolutions on weekdays,” he offered, and she rolled her eyes and fixed his collar with hands that had chosen tenderness before choosing budgets. As she left she pressed a small USB drive into his palm and did not look at him while doing it. “A friend,” she said, which was the whole explanation and also none of it. “In case memory feels like company.”

Legal arrived with hair that made arguments and a suit that had no reason to exist in a warm climate. Harriet Copley, Partner, her card would say, though the card would not admit to preferring margins to people. She smiled like a poem translated out of Latin—lovely, clever, slightly dead. “Mr. Kallio,” she said, choosing English like a weapon the two of them could both claim. “We’re so delighted to have you with us in this delightful capacity. We just want to ensure guardrails so that everyone knows what fun they’re allowed to have.”

He had told Imogen to put Amaya on the call and Imogen had. The speakerphone sat on the table like a patient animal. Amaya’s voice when she joined had the economy of someone who had been raised to believe that precision is a kindness. She introduced herself in five words that made Harriet adjust her pen. “Good morning,” she said. “Before we begin, I’d like to make clear that my client will not be acknowledging any liability for past events, will not be waiving any claims as part of a performance release, and will be granting only the rights necessary to broadcast his performance in this program in this territory for agreed windows. Moral rights remain with the artist, and any exclusive negotiation periods will be reasonable and defined.”

Harriet smiled wider in the way of people who file their teeth. “Of course,” she said, which meant in this context, Absolutely not, but do tell me what else you want so I can enjoy the pleasure of declining more. “The Company’s standard language is tried and tested. We cannot deviate for one instance without undermining our future obligations. However, we are prepared to remove the waiver language that seems to be troubling you, Mr. Kallio, given your unusual circumstances. We merely included it as a broad strokes safeguard for everyone involved.”

“You included it because you were afraid,” Eero said, and then softened it not in meaning but in tone. “Which I can respect. Fear makes good law sometimes. But not for this. This is a release for a performance I am about to give. It is not a statue of limitations you keep in your office as a conversation piece. The carveouts Amaya has outlined aren’t unreasonable. They’re, notably, the front of the brochure for decency.”

Harriet did not flinch. She was, after all, a woman whose day had to include the defense of indecent things dressed as opportunity. “We’ll take instruction,” she said, which meant she would walk down a hall and ask Gareth how angry he wanted to be. “In the meantime, perhaps we can initial the pages we agree on. You have a busy day. Let’s not let ink slow television.”

They initialed and did not sign and that was the difference between being owned and being present. When Harriet left, she took the weather with her. Amaya stayed on the line long enough to tell him, in a voice that let no one mistake her for a romantic, that she had once choir-sung under a woman who made every vowel a battlefield and that he reminded her of that precision. “Be boring when you talk to press,” she advised. “Boring is a castle. Save your poetry for the song. If you want to throw a match, the line you used last night is the kind that lights easily and doesn’t burn you.”

He took the USB Maria had given him to a corner of the dressing room where the light pretended to be neutral. The files on it gave up their names with the resigned dignity of documents that have been waiting in a drawer for a better day. Contracts with dates that correlated obscenely with his blank. Emails with redactions like bite marks. A calendar entry titled “Celebration, private,” at a time that had previously been only a sensation in his ribs. A photograph of a signed certificate with his name on a line under the word Winner and a date that made his stomach clench and then steady. He sat for a long time and let his body register that his life had in fact happened and that the gap wasn’t a hole so much as a hand pressed over his eyes.

Rehearsal for the group number turned the stage into a parade of compromises. He stood where they put him and sang notes that had learned to behave. Rory forgot where his left foot went and then remembered by instinct, which delighted the choreographer and made him apologize to the floor. Mila asked for the fog machine to be dialed down to a weather event that wouldn’t drown a village. Ananya leaned into a harmony with his name on it and winked at him like a woman making an announcement in a galaxy where announcements could still be flirtatious.

He asked for a few minutes at the piano and someone with keys that opened things made a gesture that let him into a small rehearsal room that had once been a storage cupboard and had learned ambition. The piano had given up on its upper register and had decided to be warm where it mattered. He played the first line of the song he had promised himself, found himself adjusting to the room’s grammar, and then sang the second line into the ghost of a microphone that wasn’t there. The lyrics were impolite to anyone who had missed a year and then had been informed it had been a kindness. He wrote a bridge that was shorter than it should be and more honest than he had planned. When he finished, he recorded it twice on his phone and sent it to Tom and to Amaya and to a man named Lauri at Teosto with a subject line built entirely of facts. Then he sent it to himself, watched the email leave and return, trusted the timestamp the way believers trust candles.

Gianni found him and made a shape with his hands that meant satisfaction. Today he dressed him in wool that acted like armor and in a shirt that understood narrative. The cufflinks sat neat and smug at his wrists. “The producers will hate that you’re going to sing a song you own,” Gianni said conversationally, as if discussing weather and the relative merits of pepper on strawberries. “So you must love it enough for all of them.”

“They’ll try to stop it,” Eero said, and Gianni shrugged with French eloquence that he had borrowed for the day.

“Once your segment is locked and the graphics are made and the band has a chart, only God and Imogen can stop anything,” he said. “And God is overbooked.”

The wall near the dressing rooms had changed. A photograph had appeared in the blank overnight with a neatness that would have persuaded a less precise witness. It was not the correct year. It was, to his eye, the winner from three seasons ago relocated like a painting brought forward in a museum to cover a renovation. The plaque read nothing. The screws had the sheen of adolescence. He stood looking at it until Kiran came to stand next to him and say, “Weird, right?” and then, because honesty was a contact sport for him, “I took a picture of the blank last night. For, you know, posterity. It’s in my cloud. Clouds keep secrets worse than I do.”

“Save it,” Eero said, soft enough to hide inside a murmur. “Send it to your aunt who learned a new word last night.” He lifted his hand and let his fingers hover above the glass without touching it, a benediction or a warning or both. In the reflection, his face looked like someone who had learned that the mirror had been lying about light.

Press was a hot room with too much water and not enough air. He took the questions and placed them gently into boxes. He said he was grateful. He talked about Helsinki like it was a person he missed. He used boring as architecture and decorated it lightly with charming, because he understood the value of wallpaper. Asked about last night’s comment, he said he had spoken as a lawyer to people who might find themselves presented with pages that look friendlier than they are. He smiled in a way that did not apologize for principles. He refused to be led into nouns he did not intend to throw. He ignored the question about Seline’s jewelry. He pretended not to hear the question about last year at all, because pretending sometimes lets truth grow safely on its own.

He called Petra when the day let him stand still long enough to remember that he had a mother who had given him more sentences than any judge. She answered on the first half-ring because mothers invent rings that move faster. “You made me swear,” she began without preamble, which could have meant a dozen things, but in this case meant, “I said a word I don’t allow in the kitchen, because of television.”

“I will atone with soup,” he said. He told her that he was eating and that men in questionable shoes were dressing him and that London had foxes, and she said, “Fame is a kind of illness in some places, but you have a good immune system,” which was perhaps the kindest insult anyone had ever given him. He did not tell her about the file with his name on a line under the word that had twisted his stomach. He would tell her when he could control the temperature of the room. He told her instead about a song that sounded like a person remembering the right thing at the right time. She went quiet the way she did when listening, and he pictured her looking out of a window at a tree that had outlived four winters more than she expected to. “Sing the melody you were born with,” she said at last. “Then sing the one you acquired on purpose. Make sure the second one doesn’t strangle the first.”

By late afternoon the building had started its transformation into a place where people forgive themselves for being silly because the lights are allowed to misbehave. Seline walked the corridor like a general inspecting lines. She stopped at him as if gravity had changed direction for a moment. “You’re doing an original,” she said, not asking. He nodded and she whistled low, delighted and also braced. “Be better than television deserves,” she advised. “They will try to eat it. Leave them a bone, not the marrow.”

“I’m trying not to be a sermon again,” he admitted, because humility is a useful sheet to hold in front of yourself when people have been conditioned to shoot first.

“You can be a sermon if you insist on also being a song,” she said. “Just don’t be a tweet.” She looked at his cufflink and grinned, sharp and young. “You kept it. Good. It suits you—things that are twins and know it.”

Gareth called him into the same room with the same strawberries as if fruit could melt steel. He had put on a tie for the occasion of pretending a different conversation than the one they were going to have. “We’re proud,” he said, with the practiced calm of men holding knives behind their back. “Of course your little speech gave some people hives. But hives go away. We’ll control the internet. The original—fine. Last-minute brilliance, that’s what the show does. We’ll need the publishing details. We’ll take our standard cut. You know the drill.”

“Of course,” Eero said, and placed the neatest sheet of paper he had ever printed onto the table. It was a split that would keep the show honest and let him buy a lake if strangers kept listening. It was annoying because it was fair. “I’ve registered. I’ve assigned what is reasonable and not what is not. You’ll receive cue sheets. And I’ll keep my masters when I make them, if I make them, which will require an arrangement that lets me be a person with a career and not a story with legs.”

Gareth’s smile looked painful on his face for an instant and then remembered its cues. “We’ll litigate if we must,” he said pleasantly, which was the way rich men say Let’s not be foolish, shall we. “But I think you’ll find the public loves a neat bow. If we can make one together, we will both be very comfortable men.”

“Comfort is an overrated god,” Eero said, without heat. “It makes people miss their lives.”

They looked at each other long enough to count as intimacy. Then they were interrupted because television never lets one conversation finish if it can breed two more in the space. Imogen stuck her head in and said, “Places for camera block,” and Gareth’s face did its respectful nobody-likes-holding-up-the-machine posture. Eero left the strawberries untouched just to make the day feel like a victory in one aesthetic.

Camera block was the reverse of magic: a trick taken apart so the trick could be revered. The director spoke a language that sounded like stress and precision had discovered they had relatives in common. The band was told to accent here, breathe there. Eero stood on his mark and sang his song like an outline. He discovered that saying the words He said sign here in a room that had witnessed a hundred different contracts made people look at each other involuntarily. He softened here, sharpened there, found the moment where he could move his hand and make it look like he was cutting a ribbon and not a rope.

Before the audience came in, before a man whose job title was hype was allowed to offer them permission to shout, he made one more call. Amaya answered on the first ring even though she was in the middle of something somewhere that sounded like a person doing three other things. He asked her about a sentence that had been worrying him like a loose tooth. “If I say that I was asked to sign something I did not sign last year, and that I do not intend to sign such a thing this year, is that a problem?” he asked, stacking the words carefully like plates that could break.

“It’s a sentence,” she said. “You will not name, you will not describe, you will not imply criminality. You will talk about your behavior and your choices. Let anyone who feels implicated consult their own conscience or their own counsel. And say it with the same vowels you said perpetuity with. You made a nation look up that word yesterday. Say nothing today that makes them go to sleep.”

He stood in the wings again and felt the building take its breath. The small ritual of putting the in-ear into his ear felt like choosing a side. Kiran brought him a throat lozenge as if bringing a talisman. Gianni wiped a spot off his cuff with the devotion of a man at a shrine. Maria stood in the doorway of a life she had built and looked at him like perhaps some part of her job had become meaningful accidentally. Seline adjusted a ring that could have signed treaties. Gareth laughed with a man in a headset in a way that made sharks elsewhere feel seen. The audience poured in and became plural. The floor hummed. An LED screen did its specialized sunset. Time shifted in that small way it does when you’re about to be measured for a story.

He thought of the wall with its pretend history and its earnest lie. He thought of the van and the radio and the way the song had betrayed its owner. He thought of his mother’s soup, the practical holiness of it. He thought of Petra saying Do not be polite when you should be brave and of Seline saying Use us, not like they mean. He thought of a fox that did not belong here and of a lake that belonged to no one and of a contract that had hands. He stepped forward because that was the only direction the night allowed, and took his place as if being here were something he had earned in two different lives.

When the first note left him it wasn’t a statement or a weapon. It was a hello to a room that had lied and also held him upright. He sang the song he had just made at the speed of breath. Somewhere in the second verse there was a line about remembering without permission, and you could feel the cameras lean in as if they too wanted to be absolved. At the bridge he let the piano sound like a body deciding to wake up, and the room permitted itself to be quiet in a way that felt like a favor being returned. The last chord stayed in the air and then went somewhere useful.

After, in the mess and the cheer and the choreography of competence, he stood just off camera while the host said things that were both true and false and somebody’s aunt in a village texted somebody a sentence with three exclamation points. He waited for the little place in the show where words are allowed to be more than garnish. It came as a sliver carved between advertisements and applause.

“How did that feel?” the host asked, offering him the soft ball and trusting him to either cradle it or crush it.

He held the microphone steady and talked about facts. He said he had wanted to sing something he owned. He said his name slowly as if reminding himself of it. He said that last year he had stood in a room with paper on a table and had been asked to sign something he could not live inside. He said he had left that room and then had left that year in a way he could not fully explain yet. He said this year he was here to sing and to read and that these two things were not opposites. He said he would be grateful for a life that did not ask him to forget in order to be allowed to be loud. He did not look at Gareth. He looked at the camera like a person looks at a lake when they’ve decided to go in. The audience made the sound that means a decision has just made an ally out of a stranger.

Backstage, the producers performed concern like professionals. PR whispered in clusters like bees of the panicked variety. Kiran hugged him without being asked and then apologized and then didn’t. Gianni clapped once and said something in Italian that could have been praise or a hex and, either way, felt like a ribbon being tied around a present from a man who does not do small bows. His phone hummed in his pocket like a content animal. He waited until the corridor offered him a corner with half-light and read Marja’s message. It said only: There it is. And below it, a photograph of the blank wall from last night and the wall from today, and under it a sentence: Memory is such a bitch. He laughed into his own hand and then wiped at his eye as if sweat had developed only on the left.

It would not be over tonight. He knew that as surely as he knew the shape of his scar with his thumb. There would be meetings where familiar words tried to do new work. There would be men who thought they could convince him that rooms and roads belonged to them. There would be versions of him on a screen chopped into what could be sold and versions of him in kitchens where soup saved people. But for the first time since a woman had asked him his name under lights that lied, he felt like the interior of his head had furniture in it that he had picked himself. He walked down the corridor past the wall that had tried to correct itself and smiled at the blank that wasn’t blank anymore and at the knowledge that once you know where the screws are you can take anything down and put it back somewhere more honest.

He turned a corner and found Seline leaning against a door that said No Admittance like a dare. She looked at him with her lioness indulgence and held out a hand without ceremony. He took it and she squeezed hard enough to count as a contract and then let go. “Well,” she said, and in her mouth the word contained weather and mischief and relief. “Now we see if they deserve you. And if not, we wreck their season until they do.”Chapter 6

Sunday carried itself like an apology. The sky had the washed-out modesty of a shirt someone had loved too long, and London breathed in a lower key as if trying not to offend anyone’s hangover. Eero woke with the sensation of having been remade in his own outline. It didn’t feel like triumph and it didn’t feel like fear; it felt like a room in which the furniture had been moved and his muscles were learning the new distances. He lay still and watched the slow spin of a faint scratch in the ceiling’s paint, thought briefly of the confetti that had once insisted on being weather, and then got up because bodies require kindnesses and some of those are boring.

His phone had eaten the night. There were messages that shared DNA—lawyers who had never texted him before offering congratulatory precision; classmates from a life that had smelled of printer toner and ambition sending him photographs of televisions as if he might not believe televisions existed; strangers folding their gratitude for a new word into the space where people usually kept their opinions about shoes. Marja had sent him a video of Petra in the kitchen, the two of them in league as if he were a child again and liable to ignore instructions if they were not delivered theatrically. In the video Petra raised a wooden spoon like a baton and said, in the tone of a general run by affection, “Do not let them use your mouth to sell cages,” and then tasted soup and nodded in a way that counted as doctrine. Under it, Marja had written, We booked tickets. They will let us in or we will become security.

He wrote back that he would meet them with an umbrella that could double as a weapon if necessary and a map that avoided Gareth-shaped rooms. He had not realized he had been holding his breath through a particular kind of loneliness until he read a line that said, On my way, idiot, with a string of emojis that managed to be both medical and affectionate. He drained hotel coffee that tasted like someone’s idea of punishment and went downstairs to a lobby trying so hard at glamour it had bruised itself. The woman from last night’s lift was there and said nothing to him except good morning, which was a gift. The lilies were louder than they had been and he resisted the urge to apologize to them for existing near their perfume.

The walk did the work. The city on a Sunday always looks like a set waiting for actors who overslept. He watched a triangle of pigeons perform a choreography of greed. He watched a cyclist swear beautifully at a cab. He watched a man in a coat that had witnessed grief carry a paper bag with a loaf of bread in it like a promise he could finally keep. He found himself near water again because water was a translator he trusted, and he leaned on a railing that had absorbed heat and thought about the law as a map and the law as a ritual and the law as a club you could either be hit with or be allowed to swing. He hummed under his breath and the tune sounded like it might reluctantly forgive something, eventually, after paperwork.

Amaya met him in person like a shorthand for competence. She was younger than the voice had made her in his head and older in the ways that matter. Her hair was held back the way women hold back hair when they intend to keep their head while others are losing theirs. She ordered tea and declined sugar with the elegance of a statement. He handed her the folder with the theatrical resignation of a man who had played this scene with copies of other files in other lives. She read the way surgeons are rumored to operate: quietly, without flinching, as if the business at hand were both inevitable and conquerable.

“The waiver language goes,” she said after the first pass, and he felt his spine agree as if some part of him had been waiting to hear a phrase that precise. “We trade audience. You give them sentences that make newspapers behave, and I give you a draft that makes lawyers chew their pens. They will tell you the network cannot set a precedent. You will tell them they already did when they asked you back. They will talk about programming realities like a god who can only explain himself in ratings; you will talk about human realities like a man who has found a missing year. Don’t call anyone a name you wouldn’t say to a magistrate. Don’t give them verbs that sound like crimes. Give them nouns that sound like furniture—rights, time, counsel. Nouns they cannot make you eat on air.”

He told her about the USB and the files it had disgorged. He watched her eyebrows do arithmetic. “If that certificate is authentic,” she said, low, the way one talks when a word has decided it intends to be a bomb, “then there is no version of this where they pretend it didn’t happen. They can unhang a picture. They cannot unprint a line with the proper date in the proper ink. The photograph of the blank is useful as a metaphor. The certificate is useful as a fact. Facts are rude and we need rude friends right now.”

“Maria gave it to me,” he said, and felt the fact land in the middle of the table like a delicate animal that might startle easily. “She did not say the word friend. She did not say the word apology. She put the drive in my hand the way you hand a person a glass of water and then pretend you have given them nothing perilous.”

“Then Maria is a good person having a complicated day and will have a more complicated one soon,” Amaya said, and folded the contract back to the page where someone had put hands in perpetuity, and drew a line neatly through the hands and the perpetuity and the universe. “I’m going to write them a letter with a lot of you in it and a little of me. They will dislike both of us, which is fair. They will try to keep this inside rooms; we will politely decline and insist on hallways. Also, in case you planned on saying something stupidly honest tonight, I will not advise you to stop; I will advise you to do it on purpose. Stupidity gets you sued. Purpose pays bills.”

He liked Amaya quite a lot. He liked her for the way she made the world a place with sturdy chairs in it. He left the cafe with her precision tethered to him like a balloon with a reasonable string, and met Tom outside leaning against a brick face that had decided long ago it would survive either way. Tom wore Sunday as if it had been sold to him at a discount. He handed over a folded printout as if they were in a movie about old-fashioned spies and then grinned at his own melodrama, which made Eero like him more.

“Traffic cameras,” Tom said. “The bit where they go black on the night you go missing last year. It won’t prove anything you can prosecute, because machines break and men are rarely as neat as you want them to be. But as a story it plays. We’ve placed it with a reporter who has a conscience and is not currently allergic to getting sued. He won’t run it unless you let him. We don’t kidnap people from vans twice in a week. We’re beginning to believe in the power of microphones.”

“They’ll push harder tonight,” Eero said. “They’ll make a show at looking like they aren’t pushing. They’ll hand me a thing with an apple on it and call it dessert.”

“Don’t eat fruit strangers offer you,” Tom said, and the sentence revealed a childhood where fairy tales had been read with attention. “Viktor says if they corner you alone, act like you’re recording even if you’re not. People change their shapes when they think you’ve allocated them a posterity. Text me if anyone brings up your family as leverage. We’ve moved pieces on the board you don’t need to worry about.” He paused, then added with a dryness that had warmed considerably since the warehouse, “Also, my mother watched last night and said, ‘That Finn has the good vowels. Marry him if you can.’ I told her you were married to an increasingly complex legal situation.”

“Tell her I appreciate the proposal and I am faithful to my paperwork,” he said, and Tom’s laugh did the quiet body-shaking thing men do when they are surprised by their own joy.

They arrived at the studio early enough that the building’s nervous system hadn’t been dialed up to maximum. Imogen had a scarf on over her headset like a concession to weather as religion. She stamped instructions vigorously into the floor. “We have arrivals,” she said. “People with faces are bring-their-own-coat today. Wardrobe is swearing in two languages but will love you eventually. Harriet has requested five minutes and a signature; I have requested she file that under fantasy. Gareth is in chivalry mode, which means he will walk you to doors you can open without him and look helpful.”

He caught sight of the wall and stopped. The photograph that had been wrong last night had been replaced with a photograph that was wrong in a different way. They had made an effort. The frame was older, the plaque had letters arranged with modesty. The image itself had been chosen with the kind of care a person uses when they are avoiding something specific; it was a smile and a bouquet and a confetti that had been taught not to get in anyone’s hair. The date had been omitted. The names had been avoided. Where fact should have been there was tasteful beige. Kiran came to stand beside him, holding a coffee he did not intend to drink.

“They’re in a panic,” Kiran whispered, eyes righteous and shining with a mess he might have been born to witness. “I have already saved twelve versions of this wall. My aunt thinks the wall is a mood board for human evil. I love her.”

“Your aunt will make an excellent juror in the court inside my head,” Eero said, and Kiran grinned, then got pulled along by an emergency that had been mislabeled urgent.

Press was a blur with edges. He smiled the way you do when a photographer’s face manufactures delight at a volume only dogs can hear. He said boring things with grace. He waited around the edges of rooms until rooms let him be a person. In a corner with decent light, Maria caught his sleeve with two fingers the way someone catches a falling glass without quite touching it. Up close she had the face of a woman who had not slept and the resolution of a woman who would not admit it if she had.

“They’re watching me,” she said, as though announcing the weather. “I am not a martyr; I enjoy rent. But I am not loyal to the wall. I am loyal to the idea that a song should not be a theft. If we stop making television the way men sell oil, maybe I still get to do this when I turn forty. Here is a thing you should know: they almost pulled you from the second slot last night after your sentence, and then the audience numbers did the thing they believe in instead of God, so they kept you. That will make them brave in stupid ways today. Don’t sit on couches you didn’t choose.”

“Come work in Helsinki,” he said, half-joke, half-offer, the way you do when you want to hand someone a door. “We have crimes less elegant and soup better than necessary.”

She smiled like a person who keeps her lists in her head. “Tempt me when I am not responsible for one thousand and three pieces of equipment and six egos with ring lights. Also, your mother left me a voicemail saying ‘thank you for looking after him’ in a tone I have not heard since my nan told off a neighbor for stealing peonies. I am now terrified of your family in a very nourishing way.”

Harriet found him as if she had been practicing the art of appearing just when people’s resolve had been temporarily located in pockets. She had a folder that could have been a slim bible. She smiled with all due benevolence. “Mr. Kallio,” she said, and the but did a small waltz behind her teeth. “We’ve made concessions that should soothe your counsel. We’ve removed the waiver language. We’ve adjusted the exclusivity windows so that they will not seem excessive to an informed observer. We retain, of course, standard options. We have also inserted a placeholder regarding the use of your likeness such that—”

“No,” he said, and the word wasn’t rude; it was a coffee put down before it spilled. He gestured towards a chair and did not sit. “We will sign a performance release that lets you broadcast me tonight. We will discuss anything beyond that when we are not within the twelve hours in which you hold an unusual amount of my oxygen. We will not discuss my likeness like it is an umbrella you can borrow and fail to return. I don’t consent to my face being a logo for a thing I did not pick. I don’t consent to my name on a product I did not choose to taste. The triangular world in which you are comfortable—Company, Talent, Audience—has a fourth corner. Time. I am giving you less of mine than you planned. We will all live.”

She looked at him for a long beat with a very small admiration. “You’re very good at this,” she said, and he had the feeling she meant it the way a hunter compliments a deer. “We’ll take instruction from production. Do take instruction from your heart, which I understand is how we market you. Meanwhile, if you could avoid any further episodes of... consumer education, that would be ideal. We sell magic here. Magic doesn’t enjoy being defined.”

“Magic is always a definition problem,” he said lightly. “We’ll be careful not to show too many trapdoors.” She left with her posture carrying the sound of future emails. He exhaled and walked the long way towards the shared dressing room because the long ways were safer and also because he liked being able to see people emerge as themselves in the time it took for a corridor to be walked.

In his room, the cufflinks caught the shy light and returned it with a discipline that made him think of soldiers and of wrists and of obligations you decorate because then they don’t feel like weights. Gianni had found him a shirt that understood keys and a jacket that held a crease like a conviction. “We are not giving them a makeover,” Gianni announced, pinning the angle of a collar with the finality of a judge’s gavel. “We are giving them a phenomenon, which is different. Tilt your chin like men in 1972 who smoked beautifully. Not that you should smoke. Eero, you are born for scarves in another life; alas, television has outlawed good cloth.”

Ananya arrived and sat on his sofa as if it were an instrument that needed to be tuned by an adult. Her eyes were fierce and kind. “My grandmother formed a WhatsApp group to discuss your nouns,” she said, making the words work harder than they had to. “She has renamed it ‘Contract Warriors’ and put a picture of a sword as the icon, which is a lot for a woman who threatens stew into obedience. Also, I’m singing the big note tonight because they think I’ll fake-cry and I want you to know I will real-cry if I feel like it and touch a character if anyone tells me I did it wrong.”

“Touch me,” he said without thinking, and then realized that in any other building the sentence would be a lawsuit, and in this room it was an invitation to make the air safe. She grinned, squeezed his shoulder, and the room shifted into a friendlier shape.

Rory burst in and then did his elaborate apology for the manner of his own arrival, because he could not do anything without narrating it like a lovable earthquake. “Me nan made a sign,” he said, arms already out for a hug and then stopping at the respectable line like a dog trained to sit. “It says ‘PERPETUITY IS BOGUS’ and I think she means it in a legal way but she has spelt it like a Nintendo thing, and anyway, thanks for last night, mate. I thought words like that were for uni people and I am—well, I’m me. But we all shouted it at the telly and it felt like football in a way that didn’t make me sad.”

Mila followed, bottle of water in one hand, a smirk that could slice fruit in the other. “You looked like you were sawing something,” she said. “I like men who saw. Not in a murder way. In a fix-it way. Tonight I am going to be a nightingale and then a crow. The show can collapse around me; I’ll still be in tune.” She glanced at him and her smile softened into something like kinship. “You going to do the old Leonard?”

“If I do it I will do it like it belongs to me,” he said, and she approved in a language that had grown up somewhere far from lawyers and yet kept running into them.

He had asked for a piano and been given one with unconvincing dignity, wheeled into a corner where walls had learned to be soundproof in three out of five frequencies. He closed the door and played the opening of the song that had been called self-indulgent by teenagers and religious by their fathers. He sang it not like a prayer but like a court transcript. You told me, and I told you, and then someone told me to forget, and now I am refusing to be obedient. The melody let him say that without accusing anyone except the air. He recorded it into his phone in the keynote of later. He sent it to Amaya, who replied with a thumbs-up and the sentence, I prefer this to confession.

At noon, Petra and Marja arrived with the determination of women who have made train schedules answer to them. Imogen had been bribed with a pastry with too much cream to let them in without a fuss. Petra smelled like cardamom and transport. Marja looked like sleep had owed her a favor and paid it back on the train. He went around the corner into a unremarkable bit of corridor and let himself be hugged as if the building weren’t watching and then decided he did not care if the building did. Petra pulled back and touched his face like a woman who had invented him, which was accurate. “You need eating,” she pronounced. “Also, your hair is too obedient. Also, if the British bother you we can collect you and live without music. We cannot live without you. I have brought seeds for your window if you end up in this city by accident.”

“I was kidnapped twice this week,” he said lightly, which would have been a bad choice with most mothers and was only barely acceptable with Petra because she had long ago decided that information was just oxygen with flavors. She widened her eyes, sniffed like a queen considering pardon, and then kissed his forehead and promised violence to anyone who took liberties with her future.

Marja stood back long enough to take a photograph of the three of them because she had organized their lives in snapshots since they had been children who needed proof and then hugged him with a ferocity that had always been his first medicine. “I brought your spare glasses,” she said into his sweater. “And the document that says a person called you last year on a date you didn’t know about. Nurses keep things. Also, if you faint on stage I will throw my shoe at the medic and then at you.”

“Kindness,” he said, and she snorted and rolled her eyes and then stayed until a man with a headset pretended politeness at them so well it almost looked real.

In the brief afternoon where time seemed willing to sit down and share a sandwich, Gareth summoned him with the confidential warmth of a priest who wants to discuss the sins of the wealthy. The room had the same strawberries and the same carafe and a plate of biscuits that tried to pretend they could make you behave. Gareth sat with his tie undone like a man rehearsing intimacy. He gestured at a chair and this time Eero took it because he wanted the angle. He set his phone on the table where both their eyes could observe its red light not being on. Gareth clocked the theater of it and smiled in approval of the show.

“You’ve caused a fuss,” Gareth said pleasantly. “Fuss, if aimed correctly, is the blood of television. If spilled in the wrong corridors, it’s someone else’s problem and then eventually mine. Let’s keep it where it belongs. You were, and this will pain me to say out loud, exceptional last night. Tonight we give them catharsis. We give them an old song sung like it’s new and a new song sung like it’s inevitable. Then we stand back while donations to our advertisers’ quarterly objectives roll in and you get a career. Come to the part where I hand you a pen and you do not embarrass us by telling the world pens are dangerous.”

“I’ll sing,” Eero said. “I’ll say boring things to the press so they don’t have a seizure. I will not sign anything that makes it hard for me to recognize my own name next year. I will not gift you a past that belongs to me. I will not agree to never speaking about my life so that you can tidy up your wall.”

“You’re implying history,” Gareth said very softly. “We don’t broadcast history; we broadcast the present infused with nostalgia and hope. The past is messy and often lit badly. Forgive me, Eero, but you are good at being lit. Trust me to light you. You don’t want to be a crusader. They die. Artists live.”

“I’ve read too many obituaries of artists who died in crusades they didn’t know they had enrolled for,” he said, almost gently. “I am not a saint. I am a man who was in a hospital asking his body what it remembered. I won a thing you took off a wall. I am being reasonable in ways that must be excruciating for you.”

Gareth’s face did an honest thing then, a flicker of irritation that could have lit a room if he allowed it. He was a very handsome man making a very reasonable case for a world in which reason has a terrible reputation. “If you say the word winner on air, our lawyers will drown you in adjectives,” he said, not threatening. “If you suggest we caused harm, you will discover how fast a network can be a noun that pushes back. You have been given a second coronation. I am offering you an elegant way to become what you would have been if an unfortunate year had not occurred. You are being rude to Providence.”

“Providence should have better counsel,” Eero said, stood, and left without taking a strawberry because strawberries did not deserve to be leveraged.

The afternoon slid downhill as if someone had greased it. Camera block again, but this time heavier with expectation. The guest star arrived with a freight of cameras in her wake, a friendly hurricane whose job was to make the audience feel like they were near the thing they had wanted to be near at thirteen. She hugged everyone in a neat sequence that suggested a list and then turned to him with her fame in her face like sunlight caged for transport. “Loved your boring,” she said in an American accent that had seen studios and deserts. “More people should do boring like that. You singing your own thing tonight?”

“I am,” he said, and she nodded as if this were a diagnosis and then asked him to send the chord chart to her guitarist because her guitarist lived in the world where men with clipboards schedule spontaneity and because television meant carrying a map of how to be alive.

Imogen’s voice thickened the air with reality. “Lock it, please,” she called. “And if anyone is planning to throw a grenade on my show tell me now so I can put on a splatter jacket.” She found him a beat later and softened long enough to adjust a small piece of tape on his floor that kept moving as if the room intended mischief. “If they try to stall you for signatures at five fifty-nine,” she said, low, “I will trip them using my clipboard. You didn’t hear that from me. You heard it from the gods of live.”

He didn’t have to wait for a trap. Harriet’s assistant appeared with the politeness of a particularly well-educated ghost and carried a pen that looked like a condition. “Just initials,” he murmured, gesturing towards the document on the clipboard, the signature page clipped over the clause that called itself likeness with a generosity that offended the word. Eero looked past the pen at the assistant’s immaculate nails and the small tremor at the base of his thumb. He recognized a man who had chosen to be useful in an ecosystem that punished hesitation.

“I’ll initial the page that lets you point a camera at me for twenty minutes,” he said calmly. “And I’ll write beside it that the remainder is subject to counsel and that I am not waiving a single past or future claim by standing still for your lights. If that pen produces anything else I’ll put it in my pocket and keep it as a souvenir.” He held out his hand and the assistant, with the dignity of a person who will later go home and tell his own story to someone who will listen, gave him the proper page. He wrote his initials in a neat hand that had closed deals and opened doors and under it the sentence that would make Harriet’s teeth grind in a way she would blame on coffee.

They mic’d him. They powdered his face to satisfy the appetite of cameras. They put the in-ear in his left ear and he felt the intimacy of men tapping your body into broadcast. Maria touched his elbow once because she could not stop her hand from being a hand. Seline passed within his gravity and lifted one eyebrow in a gesture that said, Show me the nouns, and he found himself grin back at her like a boy permitted to touch the grown-ups’ knives. The guest star winked at him in a way that made it clear she remembered a time before she had learned to wink at cameras. He flexed his hand, tapped the scar twice, and thought of snow pretending not to be an omen.

The show pretended to be a party and was excellent at the pretense. The group number was big enough to camouflage fear and silly enough to make anyone who wanted blood calm down. Rory’s grin could have lit billboards. Mila brooded politely and then cracked sunlight loose. Ananya sang a line that made the crane camera lean in like a bird, greedy for nectar. He stood where they had decided he should stand and sang the harmony he’d been assigned and felt, not for the first time, a love for the machine he was also currently mistrusting. Machines can be holy if you know where the wires go.

His turn came in a corridor of noise, as if someone had pulled him bodily out of an argument and shoved him into a confession booth. The old song went first because you cannot build a new house if you haven’t paid your taxes to the street. He refused to make a choice between reverence and arrogance. He sang it the way he had always wanted to, without pretending he had invented the notes, without apologizing for inventing the version of them that his mouth knew best. The band, perhaps because they had ears and had used them all their lives, moved under him with a care that made his chest hurt. Somewhere in the second verse his body did a strange tidy thing, a shift in the sternum, and the stage bled into memory. The ceiling of the hospital with its measly constellations did a quick half-dissolve over the arena lights and then ceded to confetti. He saw—or thought he saw—Gareth’s face as it had looked a year ago: untouched by cameras, unlit by duty, lit by something like pride or victory or someone else’s work. He felt hands on his shoulders, hands that had belonged to a man who had declared himself a friend to faces, and he heard a voice say, Just sign, darling, it’s a formality, and another voice, possibly his own, say the sentence that had become his sacrament: I read before I sign. The memory did not finish itself. He didn’t try to finish it. He finished the line he was singing and the line after that, and at the end he let the last vowel spend itself like a coin.

The new song next. He had registered it in three countries and in his sister’s texts and in his mother’s notebook that had recipes and a phone number for a plumber. He, absurdly, asked the camera to follow his hands to the piano as if they were both shy. He played the opening in the key of no one will stop me. He sang about rooms with paper on tables and about roads that refused to remember their cameras. He sang about finding a year under the bed like a sweater you thought you'd borrowed and then had forgotten belonged to you. He sang about confetti in a closet and a cufflink in a drawer and the way a person can be talked to like a river and told to hurry along and not notice the hands building a dam. He sang a line to his mother and a line to his sister and neither of those lines needed to be words he would choose for a judge. He felt the audience decide to believe him the way a school of fish decide to be one thing.

The host did the patter that kept lunch money flowing to networks. The judges were generous in the calibrated ways that protect their market value and then, because she had always been unprofessional in the best sense, Seline leaned forward and let her voice be human. “You wrote a map and then you walked it in front of us,” she said. “If anyone invites you to fold it up and tuck it away, don’t. Framed maps are still maps. Don’t hang yours on someone else’s wall.” Her mouth had a knife in it and also a ribbon. If they had cut to Gareth, they didn’t. They cut back to him because the audience had turned into one ear and the ear wanted more.

He took the place the host gave him like a student who has brought homework and is tired of being told it’s optional. “I don’t want to take up much oxygen,” he said, and the untruth was obvious enough to be charming. “But I’d like to say one thing about last year. There was a room. There was paper. I was asked to sign something I could not carry and I didn’t sign. After that there was a road and I lost a thing I am getting back. This year I will sing and I will read. I will not stop anyone else from signing whatever makes sense to them. I will not make my story a weapon to hit anyone else’s with. But I will not pretend I do not remember my hands.”

He watched the word hands land as if it had been passed from palm to palm. He hadn’t named anyone, hadn’t indicted anything except an appetite. The audience made the sound people make when they are grateful to be asked to be smart. Imogen’s voice in the in-ear said, offhand and full of affection she would not want named, “Nice nouns,” and he nearly laughed into the microphone, which would have been a sin and he had already sinned enough for a Sunday.

Everything performed the necessary shape until the bit where results turn an evening into an event that people will pretend to have dreamed about later. The guest star sang a song that had once been used in five weddings and two funerals and did it with enough self-awareness to keep shame out of the room. Ananya lifted a note into a place that made a woman in the second row cover her mouth with both hands. Rory put his face in his hands when his name was called safe and then put his face in his hands again when he remembered he’d been instructed not to. Mila tilted her chin at fate like a woman who considers fate a rude cashier and got through.

They lined them up like cooks in a kitchen waiting to be told which dish would be thrown away. He felt his heart behave like a trainee; he felt his legs do exactly what was required of legs. The host called his name with that slightly slowed cadence that pulls focus. He stepped forward with that little hand up that tells the room you appreciate the air. He stood next to a certain mark that had been set because cameras prefer geometry to human chaos. He was in the final two with a boy who had been born with the face of someone who should never have to work on a Saturday and had learned to be better than his face. They both clutched hands with their fingers like promises. The host did the paragraphs. The audience waited. He waited.

When they called him, he knew before the word happened, because sound sometimes takes a detour and the body is closer to certain crossroads. The noise from the room had a shape he recognized from a year ago, a roll and a pitch that had once carried him forward without his legs having to be consulted. The word winner existed and then existed twice if you counted inside him and outside him. Someone’s mouth on stage said his name with glitter in it. He looked briefly at the wall in his mind and saw both pictures and the blank between them and decided he would never walk down that corridor without touching the glass.

They handed him the thing they hand, the trophy that looks like it wants to be a building when it grows up. He took it because not taking it would be melodrama and also because he was not sure he was done being gracious as a weapon. Confetti agreed to be weather one more time. He felt it rest on his shoulders and allowed the physics of it to be true. Seline’s face had pride in it in a way that would have needed a sword in a different history. Gareth clapped a clap that looked good on camera and he did not look back at him because he is not religious in a way that requires eye contact with the devil.

He did not make a speech. He helped the boy he beat not cry into a camera. He thanked his mother in a sentence that made Petra hold on to a chair. He thanked his sister and his vowels and Finland and the audience and the band. He did not thank the wall. He did not thank anyone in the building for their legal acumen. He held the trophy like a man who understood trophies and then he held the microphone like a man who had done enough.

As soon as the red light went to sleep and the machine huffed into that airless place between states, the building tried to pull him into rooms. Harriet with two assistants and a pen that had already decided where it wanted to live; Gareth with a smile he was overworking; PR with eyes like deer who had learned to use laptops. Imogen inserted herself with a list of things that couldn’t be moved and a dignity that suggested God had been promoted to her assistant. “Photos in the corridor, then you go where Maria tells you,” she said, and that was how the night went the way it went.

Maria took him without preamble and found a narrow stair that had committed to being a shortcut. They stood on a landing because fate adores landings. She put the USB back into his hand as if returning a library book that had been unapproved. “Your mother hugged me,” she said, both delighted and terrified. “I will take that with me into any meeting I am ever in. There’s a room waiting with lawyers in it. There’s another room waiting with cameras in it and an unairable five minutes. Pick the one you want to be in first.”

“Cameras,” he said, because confession is both old and effective, and because he had promised himself that the next time he had to make a mess in order to clean up his own life he would make it where it would be witnessed and recorded and eventually memed. They walked into a small set with an ugly couch that had seen the kinds of tears that do not improve fabric. The journalist waiting was the kind who had once gotten in trouble for asking a prime minister what, exactly, he meant by hope, and who had survived popularity by not courting it.

“We have five,” she said. “Talk if you want and don’t if you don’t. I’m told my bosses will only pretend they didn’t see this if you accuse a man with a surname of murder. Please don’t do that. Tell me what you can live with hearing yourself say in the morning.”

He told her the story he had decided to be faithful to. He said he had won a year ago and then lost something that made that winning hard to live in. He said he had been asked to sign a contract that would have required him to lease out parts of his life he was not prepared to sell, and that men have a right to say no without disappearing. He said he had been shown a wall that tried to forget him and that he had friends who had showed him the blank in it. He said this year he had sang a thing he wrote and a thing he didn’t and that both had made him remember. He didn’t say anyone’s name. He didn’t say hospital and he didn’t say van. He said document and blank and year. The nouns were obedient to him when nothing else was.

The video went wherever videos go when they want to be everywhere. PR realized mid-upload what was happening and sprinted and it was too late because the internet had that look on its face that meant it had found someone besides a cat to adore and argue about. Harriet’s assistant swore softly in a way that suggested he was due a raise. Gareth found him half in shadow and made the shape of a man about to make a speech that would be remembered only by the men who wrote it. Eero adjusted his cufflink, found the scar with his thumb, and was not surprised to see Seline step out of nowhere to stand exactly too close to him for the cameras to frame him alone.

“Congratulations,” Gareth said, and the word did its work and its mirroring. “Now let’s be practical. You can’t take that narrative out there. You break the machine that will make your songs valuable. You become a line in a book people use to teach about the dangers of petulance. You become the unpleasant footnote. Come back into the room. Sign a thing crafted for men with your needs. Let me be the man who made you possible twice.”

“I don’t belong to men who count things they didn’t make,” he said, and the sentence surprised him because it was less elegant than he’d rehearsed and exactly honest enough. “I will not spend another year of my life discovering clauses in rooms that have no windows. Take your wall down and put it back with the right history in it. Fix your language. Pay your children and stop pretending they should be grateful for the opportunity to be turned into cake. Then come find me with a pen that doesn’t bleed. Until then, I’ll be in a city that knows how to be cold and how to be kind.”

Seline’s laugh was soft enough to count as weather and sharp enough to count as a tool. “You heard him,” she said to the unsummoned gods and to Gareth. “Don’t worry. He’ll still sell your advertisements. He’ll still make your mothers text your names. You can hate him and still admit you’re lucky.” She tilted her head at Eero and he realized, belatedly, that she had quietly placed herself between him and Harriet, between him and a door, between him and something else she had decided should not touch him. She moved aside only when Maria materialized with the magic of a woman who had stolen five more minutes than could be excused and said, in her new church voice, “They need him for a photograph with a fox.”

It was true as far as it went. The local papers had sent someone with a tame fox from an animal charity because photographers like metaphors and because luck sometimes develops a sense of humor late in life. He stood next to a fox that looked like it did not care about human law and smiled an honest smile and thought about running. He thought about running, and then he didn’t, because he was already where he had to be.

Later, in a quiet that did not belong to the building, he walked back to the wall. No one watched him and so he allowed himself to speak aloud to the rectangle as if that weren’t a kind of madness. “I’m not a photograph,” he told it. “But if you insist on putting me under glass, get the date right.”

He didn’t expect an answer. The wall kept its oath. He turned and found Viktor instead, which was almost as unnerving. The older man had the decent look of a person paroled for half an hour. He weakened the room’s pretense by simply being calm in it. “Well done,” he said mildly. “You made grown men clutch their children and their share prices. You made me believe in broadcast as a tool when I was beginning to suspect it was only ever an appetite.”

“I don’t know what happens next,” Eero admitted. It didn’t feel like weakness so much as like naming a weather system no one could predict. “They’ll sue without suing and threaten without threatening and make rooms worse and better. I have a mother at a hotel and a sister who is going to steal a sign from a wall. I have a lake I am supposed to be seen near and a court case on Monday I asked a colleague to take and now want back because I am not built to abandon clients even when I am a storm.”

“What happens next is they will offer you a better cage,” Viktor said. “And you will either charm it into being a porch or you will walk away and build a house. We will put people with cameras at your side for the moment—it’s cheaper than security and more efficient. We will get you a plane that leaves in the morning if you want one. We will make sure Laila feeds your plant while you are out making yourself a noun people can admire without hurting themselves.”

“You know Laila,” he said, not surprised, and Viktor smiled without letting it change his face.

“We know all the people who lend other people pens,” he said. He gestured towards the corridor in a way that gave Eero the sensation of being escorted out of a dream and into a hallway where he could choose more practical shoes.

He found Petra in a corner with a sandwich cut into triangles because someone had decided that would make people remember childhood and spend more on soda. She handed him half and he ate it with the reverence of a court agreeing with you. Marja had stolen a laminated sign that said No Food Beyond This Point and had written in marker under it Or Else with a smiley face. He laughed because it happened in his throat and he could not stop it. They walked him to the entrance as if the city might try to take him back and they intended to negotiate.

Outside, under a sky that was doing its best in the face of electricity and ambition, he stood still long enough to notice that the man in the reflective jacket had declared loyalty to the doorway and that the fox from the photograph had decided to exist in an alley where foxes are not meant to be genius or metaphors. The air had the clean dullness he had come to appreciate in this city when it had decided to be kind to lungs. Maria joined them at the curb with an expression that indicated she had not yet been fired but had developed an interest in fire. She handed Eero a thin, flat parcel wrapped badly in brown paper with a twine that had failed Home Economics.

“Someone left this under the wall,” she said. “Anonymous is a poor liar. Open it when you’re nowhere, not somewhere. It was tucked behind a framed photo with screws that had been recently kissed with a screwdriver. We don’t have to be detectives to know the shape of the hand that replaced those screws.”

He took it and did not open it because he had learned that some gifts require ritual to reveal their proper power. He said thank you like a man who meant it. He let Petra take his arm. He let Marja walk backwards in front of them for ten steps with her camera up like a guard and then scold her because he is a brother. He didn’t look back. Not because he was making a statement. Because he had learned that looking back for permission is an art form he was not interested in practicing anymore.

In the hotel room, with the city turned down to something that sounded like a sophisticated refrigerator, he put the parcel on the desk with its fake wood and its sincere dust. He washed his face with water that wished more from its life. He looked at himself in the mirror as if he’d never met him and decided yes, he liked the person who had decided nouns have uses. He sat. He untied the twine with the care of a man who has removed stitches. He peeled the paper back like a lawyer peels back a clause he expects to cut. The frame inside was cheap in a way that made him want to be affectionate towards it. Under the glass, against a white that had not aged enough to have a personality, a certificate lay with the faint curl of paper that has slept under the wrong weight. His name sat where a name belongs. The word Winner sat above a date that had once been hidden from him and now offered itself like a scar you can name. In the corner of the frame, under the glass, caught like an insect you weren’t supposed to notice, a pale piece of confetti had been trapped, still a little stubborn about giving up its shine.

He sat with it. He did not photograph it. He let it exist in the ferocious privacy of a thing that makes you yourself. Petra came and put her hand on his shoulder the way mothers put hands on shoulders when they have decided their work is to witness, not fix. Marja stood in the doorway and leaned her head against the frame in an old gesture that had comforted him when he was seven and afraid of thunder. He breathed. The world outside had invented applause and had spent it all. Inside, the three of them tried a new invention: quiet. He stayed there until quiet agreed to stay with him. Then he took the frame to the window so the city would have to be a part of it, and he said his own name out loud because sometimes your own name needs to hear your own voice pronounce it to be sure.Chapter 9

Monday started with the particular kind of quiet that cities perform after they have been loud on purpose. The hotel curtains let in a pale wedge of light that made the framed certificate look like a paper moon. Eero woke to the sound of the kettle clicking itself off, a minor miracle accomplished without heat. Petra had left a note on the desk in the handwriting that had scolded recipes into order for thirty years. We walk. Bring your coat. Eat the banana even if you don’t love it. The banana on the saucer had resigned itself to being functional rather than loved. He ate it out of obedience and found, to his surprise, that the sweetness was a kind of permission.

The headlines were arranged in the lobby like a buffet for people who preferred hysteria for breakfast. A tabloid shouted FINN WINS AGAIN? above a photograph that had made hands behave. Another paper had chosen a photograph of him mid-vowel and written, with the generous menace of British irony, THE LAWYER WHO READ THE SMALL PRINT. A third, more sober, asked softly WHERE DID LAST YEAR GO? and showed a photograph of the wall that wasn’t a wall anymore, the space where the blank had been as eloquent as the face of a nun who’d learned to lie for a good cause. A concierge whose name tag called her Eesha slid a postcard toward him of a fox in Hyde Park and said, conspiratorially, “We’re very proud of your contract advice,” as if she were telling him the hotel could do tricks.

They walked, because Petra preferred cities at ankle height. The three of them took their attention down side streets that had cultivated ivy like an alibi, past bakeries exhaling sugar and bus stops where teenagers practiced the art of being looked at from a safe distance. Marja briefed him on the day with the efficiency of a nurse handing off to a night shift. “Amaya at ten with a draft letter. Viktor’s boy says don’t get into any cars. Your managing partner has requested thirty seconds, which will be three minutes of congratulations and then the phrase ‘optics’ said as if it apologized. We fly at two if the airport agrees to still exist.”

“Do you want to stop at a shop and buy the city a sweater?” Petra asked the sky, which refused to have an opinion. “It has been dressed badly. No one tells London when its coat is wrong.” She reached up to smooth his hair and then, changing her mind, patted his cheek with the resigned tenderness of a woman who had lost the war against hair and won the war against despair. They bought coffee that tasted less like an apology than the hotel’s and sat on a bench that had been taught to hold families with fewer complaints than it needed to. For a moment none of them spoke because sometimes silence is a show you put on for the people you love.

Amaya met him in a room with carpet that had misinterpreted the concept of luxury. She set a folder down and smoothed the cover with her palm like a woman soothing an injured cat. “I’ve written a letter that will travel,” she said. “It is polite until it has to be rude. It recites facts the way a hymn recites names. It requests revision of standard agreements for all contestants going forward, not just you. It suggests that the network put the correct photograph back on the wall and call it a clerical error in a tone that makes people want to forgive them if forgiveness is cheap this week. It also suggests that any future waiver language that mentions personal injury will be limited to tripping over cables, not losing your name.”

He read and felt his spine get involved. The sentences had the steady shine of steel. “You wrote for mothers,” he said, admiring the way the nouns stood like chairs and invited tired people to sit. “And for boys who are going to sign things in rooms where there is fruit. And for Harriet, who enjoys chewing on her own restraint.”

“I wrote for cameras,” she said. “Because cameras will read it without moving their mouths. And then I wrote for judges, who always move their mouths when they read that kind of thing. Also, I wrote for you, because you are the kind of man who will want to put this language in his mouth and feel where the edges are.”

His phone buzzed with a number that his bones recognized before his brain did. “Eero,” said his managing partner, a man whose name had tastefully removed itself from most sentences over the years. “I’m torn between demanding your immediate return to court and asking for tickets. The country has decided you are handsome when you refuse to be robbed on television. That’s useful for law, which we are, last time I checked. Monday’s hearing. Do you want it back? Our junior can keep it if fame has made you unsuitable for eyebrows.”

“I want it,” Eero said, and meant it with a relief that surprised him. “I will be back in the morning if Finnair doesn’t decide to become a concept. I promise to wear a boring tie and to remember the names of clauses as if they were people.”

“We’re proud,” the man said, and the admission lived shyly in his throat, unused to daylight. “Try not to burn down anything we also need to use.”

They went to the airport with a sense of mission that made security perform at its best. A child behind them pointed boldly and announced, with the authority of the untrained, “It’s the lawyer singer,” and his mother said, “Don’t point, darling,” and then pointed too. A flight attendant with a name tag that said Priya leaned toward him when she checked their boarding passes and whispered, “My brother is going to audition next year. Thank you for telling him to take a pen.” On the plane, Petra engineered naps as if they were medicines. Marja compiled a list of headlines and then drew a fox in the margin with such gravitas he had to take her pen away.

Helsinki accepted them without ceremony, which is to say it did its job. The winter had turned itself down to a sane level and the sky wore its gray like a profession. Laila collected them at arrivals in a coat that had decided to be a cape halfway through its career. She smelled like mint gum and the first hour of snow. He had not realized how much he had wanted to see her until he did. She looked him over with the slow care of a person inspecting a borrowed car for scratches and then hugged him with a familiarity that made three months fall off the calendar.

“You look like the television is finished with you,” she said, stepping back to assess. “Temporarily. Don’t get smug. Your plant survived. I taught it not to die. It hates me and lives out of spite. The city pretended not to notice you and then noticed you at the moment you stopped looking. We taped a picture of your face to the coffee machine at work and it exploded, which is a metaphor I will explore later.”

“In what universe is coffee a metaphor for me?” he asked, unable to stop smiling. She reached up and flicked his ear the way she had when they had been nineteen and he had been correctly wrong about everything.

“In one where we all learned we needed your nouns,” she said. “And, for the record, I always told you not to get in vans. This is a victory for me personally.” She pulled Petra into conversation immediately with the joyous ruthlessness of someone who had adopted other people’s families and been adopted in return. Marja went ahead to plague the cat with affection and to check if the radiator was behaving like a citizen. Laila stayed in the doorway with him for a second longer than the doorway had been designed to accommodate.

“Did you remember anything else?” she asked, and her voice did not wobble because she had long ago disciplined her voice into being useful.

“I remembered a room,” he said. “And a road. And realizing I had been asked to choose in ways that were not really choices. And a kind of arrogant happiness that felt like standing near a cliff you have convinced yourself will not mind if you step too close.”

She reached up and touched his scar with her thumb, a gesture that felt like an old map. “Then you can stop apologizing to yourself,” she said simply. “Or we can make a schedule for your apologies and put them in the afternoons so they don’t interfere with lunch.”

Court the next morning had the dignity of a church that refused to play favorites. The judge’s eyebrows were unchanged and somehow reassuring. The other side’s counsel wore a tie so hopeful it could qualify for a grant. Eero stood at the lectern and found the rhythm of sentences that had to convince not a camera but a human who had read more than he had and would keep reading after he left. He spoke about a lease and an easement and a right that had been exercised too enthusiastically and he found his hands, without his permission, behave like they did when he sang a phrase that had been shaped by trees. The courtroom had no camera crane to lean in when he chose a good metaphor; it had a clerk whose pen clicked when she approved. It was all the drama he needed.

He won the motion, which meant that for the rest of the day he was greeted in the corridor by men with files who had watched a small portion of television and thought it polite to mention it before returning to mortgages. Outside, a reporter stationed by the steps for reasons that had nothing to do with Eero put a microphone in his direction as if the weather had been asked to comment on itself. He said boring things on purpose. He said, “The court has spoken clearly,” and “We’re grateful for the clarity,” and “No further comment,” as if his mouth had been hired by a committee and paid by the clause. He turned away before any question with the word talent in it could attach itself.

Maria called from a stairwell that sounded like a ship in need of a carpenter. “My keycard failed,” she said, not theatrically. “Security escorted me to an office with fruit. I have been put on administrative leave pending the resolution of an ‘internal matter’ in which my name will be pronounced as if it has too many syllables. No one has said the word scapegoat out loud, which shows restraint. I’m not surprised. I am not, however, easy to take down the way they like to. I have a mother who trained me on sales in outdoor markets with less integrity than a network. I will be fine. I am telling you before you see it online and decide to write me poetry.”

He felt the guilt like a dog at his ankle and asked it to sit. “Come to Helsinki,” he said. “Not forever if forever is rude. For a week. Call it operational self-care. My office has spare desks. My mother has soup. My city has air that will take the television-flavor out of your lungs.”

“I can’t,” she said immediately, then paused in the way people do when their mouths are waiting for their lives to arrive. “I can. I’ll book a flight that suggests I know what I’m doing. Tell your soup I eat vegetables. Tell your sister I can carry heavy things. Tell your mother I know how to be polite to herbs.”

He hung up and sent a message to Amaya that said: They bite. She replied: They bite softer when you make the newspapers call their teeth by their proper names. Then: We’ve had a response. It is a letter that uses words like partnership and synergy and misremembers the shape of reality. It also says they will review contracts going forward. They will never admit to the wall. We have to decide how much victory you can carry without dropping the songs.

At home, the plant Laila had trained into survival sat on the windowsill and pretended it had not been anxious. He put the framed certificate on the low bookcase near the window where light had practiced being kind in the afternoons. Petra examined it like an artifact and then, without ceremony, dusted it with a corner of her apron as if the past didn’t get away with anything in her house. Marja texted Kiran a photograph of the frame and the confetti trapped under the glass and received back a flurry of heart emojis and a picture of a fox wearing a crown. He responded: I made Auntie merch. The word perpetuity on a mug. Finland will not buy. Britain will buy and pretend the joke is about someone else. He added, The wall is now a slideshow. They have given it a screen. It plays the winners in order with a tasteful crossfade. Guess what’s missing. Guess who is annoying them with USB sticks and attendance at Meeting A.

The first day back at the firm felt like putting on a pair of shoes that had not forgiven him for cheating on them. The receptionist looked at him with the pleased surprise of a person who has found a familiar book on a shelf where strangers have left their romance novels. His desk had acquired gifts: a plant cutting in a jam jar from someone downstairs, a postcard of the Helsinki Cathedral with an arrow drawn to an imagined small doorway and the words Secret lawyer entrance, a Tupperware with pulla inside from a paralegal who had accidentally fallen in love with the vowels in perpetuity. He sat and opened emails and answered queries and redrafted something dull into something airtight and felt a kind of holy relief that had nothing to do with applause.

Laila perched on his window ledge as if she had right of elevation and watched him with the fond impatience of a person waiting for you to finish being responsible so you can be interesting. “Your phone is going to be a bad instrument for a few days,” she said. “It will try to make you into a person you didn’t apply to be. Put it in the drawer and let it fight the stapler. What are we doing about the woman you are importing?”

“Teaching her how to pronounce korvapuusti and stealing the better part of her brain for my clients,” he said. “Taking her to the lake. Letting her stand in a field and find out that trees can be witnesses and not just furniture.”

“You’ve always had a terrible missionary streak when it comes to Finland,” she said, approving. “Try not to write her into a poem. She probably contains her own.”

He wrote at night because nights had become the only place time showed up without makeup. The new songs weren’t difficult so much as careful. He wrote one that began with someone putting a hand on your shoulder in a room with fruit and ended with you leaving the hand behind. He wrote one that had only vowels for the first two lines and then seem to grow its own consonants. He wrote one for Petra that made no sense until it did and then made her sit down abruptly and pretend to scold him for bringing a guitar into the kitchen. He recorded them on his phone and sent them to Tom, who texted back a heart emoji he probably didn’t intend to send and then a second text that said, That wasn’t meant for a man, but it fits.

Wednesday afternoon the network sent a courier in a suit so proper it had probably never been allowed to wrinkle. The envelope was thick and heavy enough to contain the sin it was trying to dissolve. He opened it at the long table in the conference room with Laila watching as if opening letters were dangerous, which in their world it often was. The language apologized without apologizing. The phrases “regret any distress” and “honored to host your talent” danced around the edges of what had been done. The new contracts attached were better. They were not good. They carved away the worst of the claws and left the paw intact.

He sent them to Amaya with the note: We will be meaner later. She responded in under a minute: Now would be good.

He called and put her on speaker with Laila for the pleasure of watching two excellent women who would never need him. “We use this,” Amaya said, as if instructing a crowd of professional thieves on the proper application of daylight. “We make a public statement that commits them to these terms for the next season. We’re not their regulator. But we can make their audience expect worse of them if they try to backslide. We leave the question of the missing year open and hungry. We do not accuse anyone. We show the certificate eventually. Not with a flourish. At a kitchen table. We are not the ones who turn this into a circus.”

“They’re going to keep at Maria,” Laila said, sharp. “They like sacrifices in skirts. If she resigns, they’ll call it a family decision. If she doesn’t, they’ll make her eat loyalty until she can’t swallow.”

“I’m already making calls,” Amaya said. “She’ll have choices. There’s an indie production company that makes shows that cost less and wound less. There’s a news program that likes their producers tired but valorous. She won’t be left alone with a lanyard and a prayer. In the meantime, when she lands in your country, feed her soup.”

The press kept calling. He met carefully with the intelligent ones and refused the others. He went on a radio show where the host had a laugh like heavy rain and spoke about contracts like a person who believed that adults could be told what adults needed to be told. He avoided names. He said nouns. He said, “Time,” too many times and then apologized, not for the principle, but for the repetition. He learned to like the sound of other people telling him that he had made their kitchen feel like a workplace.

He booked a small bar on a corner that had reinvented itself six times and was now comfortable with who it had ended up being. The owner, a tall man with eyebrows that looked like punctuation marks, took him into the back room and said, “We had a band once that broke the front window by singing too hard. If you shout we’ll love you, but not that much.” He sold tickets at a price even teenagers could bear. He listed the show with a description that said only One voice, one piano, one clause. The place filled with people who looked like they might have been invited to jury duty and decided to dress up.

He read out clauses between songs not to perform law but to remind himself that the words were not sacred, merely arranged by men who thought they shouldn’t be questioned. He sang the Leonard song and was not forgiven; he did not apologize. He sang the new one with the bridge that refused to lengthen and watched a man in the back wipe his eyes until he stopped pretending to wipe his nose. He spoke the sentence, “A contract is a story about the future written by the past,” and the room made the small noise of people rearranging their furniture to fit a new truth.

Halfway through the set, as he was talking about handwriting versus signatures and the way some pens drag like reluctant horses, the door opened and Seline walked in like a sentence with an honorary degree. She wore a coat that forced the room to recalibrate what it thought red could do for a person. She sat at a small table near the piano and did not demand attention; she altered it. After the song, she raised a hand as if she were in a good classroom and said, “Do you take requests?” People laughed and then shut up because they wanted the answer to be yes. He nodded at the impossibility of telling her no and she said, “Sing the one you wrote for your mother that you didn’t intend to sing in public yet.”

Petra, near the back, with soup in her bones like iron, made a noise that sounded like a person surprised by love. He had only sung the song once at the kitchen table when the oven light had decided to be the moon. He had not thought to name it. He said the first line and then the second came without needing to be invited. It was a song with too few chords and too much affection; it was a small town song that had decided to move to the city and keep speaking with its accent. When he finished, Seline stood up and clapped a precise clap that gave everyone else permission to be ridiculous.

After, she found him by the ice machine that had retired from ambition. “They’re going to come again,” she warned, not scaring him so much as reminding him of weather patterns. “They can’t help themselves. You didn’t take the apple. They’ll make a pear. You embarrassed them by teaching the audience to be smart on a Sunday. They prefer an audience they can teach to dance. I brought you a gift that looks like a threat.”

She pressed a folded piece of paper into his hand. It had been folded and unfolded so many times the fibers looked like the place a shirt gives up. He opened it and saw a still photograph printed on cheap stock. The angle was familiar; it had been taken from where runners line up to count breaths and panic. He had seen that angle in dreams. In the picture, last year’s room had been caught in a moment when it believed itself unobserved. He was there, blurred like an argument. Gareth was there, turned three-quarters away from a camera that had been made in a factory that could not have anticipated this particular scene. Between them on the table a sheet of paper lay with a black line drawn through a paragraph in a lawyer’s clear hand. He recognized the line. He recognized the hand. Across the bottom in a different pen were the words, in someone’s tidy impatience: We’ll talk. Tonight. Let cameras love you.

“Where?” he asked, throat gone dry because his own memory was complicated enough without a photograph choosing to be evidence.

“In a drawer I am not proud of having access to,” she said cheerfully, like a woman admitting to excellent gossip. “I’m not a good person. Lucky for both of us, I’m useful. Keep it. Or burn it. Either way, remember that if you’re a story to them, they are also a story to you. Write them in the grammar they prefer not to see.”

Maria arrived on Friday in a coat she could return if London apologized. The first thing she did in Helsinki was stand outside the airport and breathe, a performance that made an old woman passing her assignment her approval. “You look different,” Laila said, sweeping her into the car with a welcome so un-British Maria almost cried. “Like a person who has stopped being a bullet point.”

“I cried at the plane,” Maria admitted, apologetic. “I never cry at planes. Planes are things we endure. I cried at a child who was asleep with his mouth open because his mother had tucked his scarf under his chin at a heroic angle.” She slept on Eero’s couch in the way professional women sleep when they are sure someone has hung bells on the doors. She ate soup. She took notes. She called her mother and said, “I’m going to work in a place where soup is a noun with rights.”

They took her to the lake because people who believe that land is an argument need water to correct them. The ice was a rumor in a month that was pretending to be gentle. The sky was a grey that artists have tried to name and failed. Maria stood on the shore and put her hands in her pockets and shifted from foot to foot like a city person and then stood still because she realized motion wasn’t necessary here. “How dare you hoard this,” she said, half-accusing Finland. “We have all been paying rent on the wrong view.”

They sat on a bench that looked like it had been made by a man called Arto who believed wood had feelings. Eero told them about Gareth’s letter and Amaya’s reply and Seline’s photograph. Maria listened with the attention she had used to turn chaos into ratings. “He will settle,” she said, staring at the water as if it were delivering minutes. “Not because he is sorry. Because he has calculus. The season is saved. The advertisers are reassured. He will perform contrition in a suit that says weekend. He will call you family in a sentence and then demand you behave at a volume only dogs hear. We will not be family. We will be neighbors. Build a fence high enough to make him bring a ladder. Ladders are expensive.”

Saturday brought snow that forgot to winter and tried poetry instead. The network called with an offer that used the words independent and partnership and legacy like cards in a house that would fall over if someone closed a door. They offered to put the photograph back with a speech about administrative oversight. They offered a fund for “contestant care,” which was a polite way to say they had invented a tip jar for moral injury. They offered to include his new song on a compilation album whose royalties would be something you could explain but not justify. He and Amaya said the kind of yes that sounds like no if you listen correctly.

He got a message from his father’s old chess friend in Oulu with a picture of a board mid-game and the note: Your mouth is like a bishop. It moves diagonally. Watch for the rook. He got a joke from Tom that was almost not a joke: Viktor says if you get a dog he will name it Jurisdiction. He got a photograph from Kiran of the wall’s slideshow caught mid-glitch, the crossfade between this year and a tasteful beige freezing for a second into a mess of confetti and absence. Under it Kiran had written: Ghosts have preferences. I have named the glitch after you.

Eero went to church on Sunday by accident, following a group of elderly women into a building that had decided to be more useful than pictures. He sat at the back in a coat that had learned to be quiet and listened to hymns whose melodies seemed to have been constructed by carpenters. He didn’t have business with the God on offer, but he liked the idea of people sticking their names under something bigger when the world had been loud at them. He thought about the word winner and tried to be suspicious of it, then put it down for a while, the way you put a glass down when you realize you have been holding it as if it contains medicine.

On Monday, an envelope arrived that smelled like expensive mistakes. It was from the network’s external counsel, a firm that had furnished an entire floor in London in grey and the idea of taste. The letter warned in a delightful light about potential defamation if he continued to insinuate that a year had been swallowed on purpose. It suggested he might want to reconsider being so forthright on smaller stages. It proposed a conversation in a room with no microphones and the word confidential written on the air. It was signed in ink that looked like a river pretending not to be fast.

He took it to the window and read it out loud to Laila, who interrupted him twice to fix the grammar. He sent a copy to Amaya, who replied with a draft that began, Thank you for your attention to our nouns, and then proceeded to undress the letter layer by layer until it stood in the room cold and unadorned. She concluded, Kindly note that we will be making no statements of fact beyond those which we can support with documents in our possession. We will, however, continue to speak generally about contracts on live television at our discretion. She sent it and then called him to say, “If they ask for your silence, ask for their paperwork. They’ll stop asking.”

On Tuesday he invited three girls from a local school to his office because a teacher who had grown tired of watching clever children be bored had written to him. He talked to them about reading and about money and about not letting anyone tell you that bravery is self-indulgent. They asked him if television felt like a fever dream. He told them the truth: that some of it had been fever, and some of it had been the best kind of clarity, and that both had drivers and both could take you places you didn’t mean to go if you didn’t pretend to be asleep. He played them the new song on his phone. They looked solemn and then laughed together at a single line, exactly where he had secretly hoped they would.

The week collected itself into something he could file. There were nights when he stood by the window and watched snow move like a song he hadn’t written yet. There were mornings when the cat sat on his briefcase and took a clear position on work–life balance. There were afternoons when Maria returned from meetings with a new glint he recognized as agency. There were texts from Seline that were both weapons and tea. There were clean drafts from Amaya, and messes from Gareth disguised as pathways, and small reliable joys in the shape of Petra’s bread and Marja’s photographs of the lake at ungodly hours when the light could be mistaken for forgiveness.

At the end of that week, he opened the old wooden drawer in his father’s desk, the one that had always misbehaved and then allowed itself to be persuaded. The certificate went inside for a minute because talismans don’t need to be stared at to be useful. He took from the drawer a notebook with his father’s addresses and, tucked into the back, a note in his father’s hand he’d forgotten was there. It said, Call men by their names when you have to. Call them by their work when you can. He folded it into his wallet like an inconvenient saint.

Friday evening, as he was lacing his shoes to go and be useful to a room full of people he did not know, his phone buzzed with a video file that had been sent with no message and a subject line with all the vowels removed, an in-joke he regretted knowing. He opened it expecting nothing and found the room from a year ago again, but this time moving and breathing. The angle was poor, the sound better than it had a right to be. He watched himself laugh at something that wasn’t funny in a way that suggested a person trying to be a colleague to his own opportunity. He watched Gareth lean in and put his hand on the back of the chair near Eero’s shoulder, not quite touching. He watched himself say, clear as ice water, “I don’t sign this as written,” and he watched a shadow in the corner, someone he couldn’t resolve with the resolution provided, step forward with a hand, and he watched the doorway fill with someone else, and then the video cut abruptly, as if the phone that had been filming had been politely guided to look at the floor.

He stood at the window until the cold made his eyes water, and then he sent the video to Amaya and to Tom with the single sentence: This is both too much and not enough. Tom replied with a sentence that made him like the man more than was useful: That’s also what people say about art. Amaya called him and asked him to breathe while she made a list on the other end of the line. “We do nothing reckless,” she said. “We ask the sender—whoever that is—to identify themselves or at least the room. We make copies in places that cannot be burned by a man who believes he has a switch. We tell Maria to pretend she doesn’t know where the USB sticks are. We do not let this be our only story.”

He performed that night in a community hall with a smell of wet coats and ambition. He sang the song he had written for his mother and he sang the song he had written for men who write contracts and he sang a song from when he had been seventeen and believed that leaving was the same as living. He kept the video in his pocket like a coin he wasn’t sure he should spend. After, a woman in a sweater that had been scolded once too often for pilling came to him and said, with the authority of the tired, “You untangled something I didn’t know was tangled.” He thanked her the way you thank a bus for arriving in bad weather.

On the way home the city felt like a body that had accepted medicine. Laila walked beside him with her hands in her pockets like a warning to anyone who thought to try something clever. Maria walked on his other side with her shoulders down for the first time since he had met her in a corridor pretending to be a home. They were a shape that made sense. He thought of the van, and of the wall, and of the envelope, and of the lake, and of the way a person can call themselves by their name and mean it, and for the first time in a year the word winner didn’t make him want to look over his shoulder to see if someone else was better qualified to answer to it. He said his name out loud once into the cold, not loudly, not like a performance, only the way a person checks their keys in their pocket and finds them still there.
