There are nights when the city loses its outline. Tauranga drips into the harbour like ink that forgot its pattern, street lamps furring in sea air, trucks sighing over the bridge, gates clacking in a wind that changed its mind. That is when Cornelius paints the ants. He rolls back the mildew canvas from the floor of his room—a room that was once a storeroom, then a fishmonger’s annex, then nothing at all but a rectangle of damp left to breed a smell—and he kneels with his spine tilted against the lath wall and holds the brush so lightly even the ants seem to pause. It is a hair-thin thing of sable and tape. He had found the brush in a box of broken lots at a Tuesday market, snapped one length shorter, ferrule dented, the price written in permanent marker: $2. There had been, once, the idea of fine instruments, of a studio with skylight windows slanted to drink up a good day. But he had learned the truth about instruments. You can make a violin of a shutter, a prayer from a cough.

The ants skitter in the gutter of his eye, then they become black strokes, egg-shaped thoraxes, stylized legs. He knows them. The carpenter, the fiery, the sand that tornados under a log. He knows their movements and their negotiations. He knows the way a frightened ant picks up a scent and runs, then runs again because there is nothing to run to except the fact of fear. He paints their shadows, always too wide for their bodies, and in the shadows there are houses and towns and a boy’s full mouth closing around a name. Cornelius does not write that name anymore. He slows the brush and steadies the canvas with one knuckle that is more like a knuckle of a horse, thick and oval and pale where the light scrubs it. He is an ogre; there is no benefit pretending otherwise. He cannot fit into a couch without turning his hip sideways and he cannot hold a teacup without fear of crushing the rim. He is the shape that makes mothers speak softly and step between their prams and him. He is nearly beautiful when asleep, so long as no one measures.

He writes about it too. On paper torn from receipt spools gone limp in some failed café, on the back of takeaway menus, on the brown side of cardboard. He writes in a slanted hand that yaws into itself, line by line, without margins. His writing is not for readers, not really. It is to keep the hive alive, to keep it humming. He writes, The ant is a sentence that nobody reads because nobody understands how the verb in an ant is the whole god of the verb, and if I lean down and put my ear to the floor I can hear the marching grammar. He writes, Rejection is not a word. It is a kind of vacuum where all words lose their gravity. He writes, When she lifted her eyebrow like that, like the latch of a gate, I understood that even the dead bolts felt more welcome in their housings than I did in mine.

Before the paintings of ants came the paintings of faces. He had tried them and the faces looked like neighborhoods, arranged for somebody else’s daily use. They made people snicker in galleries with produce baskets and mismatched spoons. They said words like outsider and grotesque like they were going to hang those words on the wall next to his prices. He had seen the wall labels: Cornelius (year of birth unknown), media: acrylic, bone, dirt, found material. Nobody put: life. Nobody wrote: he walks home at three a.m. so he does not have to be a moving bruise during the day. No one wrote: the art school wrote him back a postcard with a sketch of a chair on it and the caption Sorry, all occupied. He had laughed when he got that postcard, a good laugh like he was in on the joke, and then he had felt that laugh unspool like thread caught on a nail and realized the joke was a net and he was a fish. And then the faces stopped. The ants remained. The ants did not ask for faces. They did not ask for permission. They marched.

DCI Reine, on the other hand, wakes to the smell of antiseptic and wheels. He is a nurse first; this is his confession. He remembers learning to fold a hospital corner as if he were tucking a child into a sheet of water, and he remembers the exquisitely ordinary heroism of blood sugar numbers, the exact tilt of a patient’s chin before a sip. He is a detective because the city insisted on it. Because someone has to ask the questions that people try to hold in their immovable throats. And in Tauranga, where the bay looks like the parting of worlds, the police had learned to say titles that are not always strictly correct in the British way, and he had accepted DCI as a jacket he could wear over scrubs when he had to. At night, he stays on the seventh floor and writes notes in a pocket ledger about who is dying and who is pretending not to. In the morning, he drives a white Corolla to the stationhouse and sits in a room with a table that has uncountable scars and a window that once had a bullet chip in it. He drinks his coffee like he is apologizing to it.

It is in that room on a wet Tuesday that a junior constable slides a manilla folder across the table. The folder is damp. Reine feels the damp come up through his fingers. Inside are photographs: small paintings left on doorstep steps, propped against wheelie bins, placed like offerings at the bases of lamp poles. Ants. Not cartoonish, not cute. Precise, haunted. In one picture, approximate to life size, three ants carry a sliver of blue glass that looks heavier than them by many times. The lines are peculiar. The text on the back of each canvas—because there is text, always—is odder. A courier found the first one outside the library after a phone call about a suspicious package. The second turned up outside a councilwoman’s office with a note tucked beneath it in which someone had written: and what if we measure our lives by how much we can bear, not by how much we can show. The third was left on the steps of a private school after the spring gala. Each had a title scrawled in graphite: Small Marches, Carapace Meadow, City with 60,000 Knees.

“What do you think?” the constable says, too eager and a little ashamed of being too eager.

“They’re good,” Reine says, which is an inadmissible statement, but true. “Creepy,” the constable offers, like a life buoy. “Weird we haven’t picked him up yet.”

“Maybe we don’t have to pick him up,” Reine says. “Perhaps he’s about to pick us.”

The constable looks at him the way a younger person looks at an older one, hearing an edge they don’t fully recognize. Reine has not said out loud that the notes bother him, the way they unravel into this mania that feels too organized to be ordinary. Obsessions are often messy. These are clean. He thinks of the ants themselves, the way a colony divides labour and retains protocols across generations with no blueprint. He thinks of the way people are ants with stories. He rubs a knuckle under his eye and gets a smear of the dampness on his cheek. He feels tired in the way that lies just below his face, like a stubble of exhaustion.

He goes to the hospital and changes a dressing for the sixth time that day, because the wound beneath it cannot decide whether to heal or be theatre. He speaks to a man who asked him a question and then forgot the question and then asked again, cycling, each time more gentle. He glances out at the hill of the Mount, at that green knob of certainty, and thinks: I’ll run up you someday and swear, at the summit, to retire. The vow moves through him like a laugh. He has made it before. He will make it again. He is a nurse from Tauranga and a detective from Tauranga and a man from no particular place where labels are what we grab to keep from drowning, and he knows he has to stop the thing with the ants even though he cannot say why. It is a sensing. Nurses have that.

Cornelius writes another entry. The paper is from a cereal carton. He chooses the interior, the grey. He uses a sharp pencil. The pencil is not sharp but sharper than it was. He writes, There is an experiment I need to try. He writes, There is a whisper that arrives like sugar dissolving, like it never was but you taste it anyways. He writes, I will not be tender forever. Once he did try to be tender. There was a woman with hair the colour of a burnt field who watched him at a bus stop and asked, with that frank clean voice of someone who moved through the world with doors held open for her, Did you paint those insects. He had said yes. She had said I like them more than I should, and he did not know what he should say to that. Should. He has been strangled by shoulds. He asked her if she wanted to see how they came about and she said yes and followed him down the wet street into the room that used to be a fish store, into the smell of mackerel that was not there anymore but it had soaked into the rafters and would lift out in rain like a ghost. She had looked at the canvases and touched—lightly, but still—one edge. Her nails were unpainted. He saw a half moon of ridge. She said, They make me feel small. He folded his hands behind him as if he were being measured for cuffs. He heard rejection come trotting down the hall with a leash in its mouth. He told himself: not this time. He offered her tea. She said, maybe next time, and left, and next time did not come, and the next next time neither.

When the postcard from the art school came—this was before her, but after other shames—he pinned it to the wall upside down so the chair would look like a boat and the caption would look like a warning. He left it there until one night he woke with the sense of someone standing at the foot of his bed. He sat up and saw no one and switched on the lamp and the postcard slid in the stirred air and twirled and tacked to the floor. He picked it up and the pin had sheared a corner and he thought of his own shoulder blades held together by cartilage and curses, and he laughed without his mouth. He boiled water. He made tea with a bag that had been re-steeped twenty times and tasted of patience and tannin and roofs. He sipped at the window and watched the rain write its habits on the tarmac outside and then he thought: what if the ants could be more than a procession, what if they could be a confession. What if he took them to the people who said no to faces and yes to white walls, and placed them at their doors, and made them step over the march.

The first drop was at a library because libraries had never turned him away except when hours were hours. He left the small rectangular of canvas on the step in the early morning as the cleaners rolled their carts inside. He went back to his room and sat on his bed and waited for a knock that did not come. A photograph reached him instead, online, posted by a security guard with an appetite for side narratives. He felt a heat like he had eaten something wrong. He wanted both to be praised and to be ignored. He wanted a miracle that excused itself afterwards. He wrote on cardboard and tucked it under the frame. He wrote as if he were writing to ants.

Reine takes the folder home and puts it on the table with the plant that has resurrected itself nine times. He tells himself he will look later, after a nap. He lies on his couch with his feet crossing over the arm and dreams of a corridor with too many doors, and when he wakes, the light has failed and the plant looks more alive, as if his sleep nourished it, and this is a silly thought but he lets it stand. He could call his mother. Instead he opens the folder and goes through each photograph. He has seen worse. He has seen bodies and he has seen lies and he has seen the way the lie sits on a face like a fever. These are ants. But they are not nothing. He reads the text written in graphite on the back of each: descriptions that pretend to be labels and are not. On one, the text holds the sentence: We are not solitary even if we were made wrong. He feels this in his bones. He has never felt correct in only one profession, never felt stitched wholly to one story. As a nurse, he can hold a hand and as a detective he can ask a question whose answer will ruin someone’s life. Both are authority, both are disguised pleadings.

He takes the photographs to his desk at work and arranges them in a grid the way someone interested in patterns does. One was left outside the school, one outside the council, one outside the library, one outside a supermarket in the cheap side of town. There is no immediate math that his brain can do. He writes small notes: times, locations, imagined routes between. He says to the room without anyone in it, “Someone wants to be heard, but not by a person who knows their name.” He thinks of the hospital again, how sometimes a patient will confess a secret to a nurse because they know the nurse cannot arrest them and cannot amplify them and cannot, in any official sense, hold their confession in a way that matters to the world. But a nurse can hold. And sometimes that holding is more real than the world.

Cornelius begins to go out in the day again. He chooses the hours when the sun flattens and the town tries to be more than a seaside. He walks with a hunch that does not help, as if by folding himself he can be less. The children spot him first because children are adapted for noticing what the grown have filtered out. They see his hands and his gait and they feel it like a joke and a fright. He does not want to frighten them. He would like to tell them about ant architecture, how the tiny things can move dirt in a way that changes a stream. He would like to tell them: it is possible to be small and still move a river, it is possible to be large and be moved by said river without anybody caring. He does not speak to them. He carries a milk crate with two canvases and a piece of chalk. He draws an oval on the footpath and places the first canvas inside the oval. He writes in chalk around it: please step over. When he leaves, he looks back and sees a woman with a pram veer, the pram wheel hesitating, the pram body leaning, the baby inside reaching a hand out as if to grasp the drawing and rub it into the concrete.

At home, he writes. He writes about impulse. He writes about performative rage. He writes about how the word villain tastes like something sweet first and then like earth. He writes: I am turning into a plan. He writes: once I dreamed of an opera house and a chorus of ants singing my name in frequencies too high for human ears and in the dream the opera house caught fire and the flames had too many legs. He writes: a mass is not a church, a mass is something you kill if it inconveniences your lawn. He touches the jar of paint thinner and notices that it leaves a cold circle on the skin of his finger that does not go away. He recoils and puts the lid back on as if he can replace a thought by replacing a lid.

Reine, in the ward, sticks his stethoscope into his ears and listens to a heart that is going to quit soon. It is not melodrama. It is statistics. He speaks to the man attached to the heart and says he is sorry and means it. He asks if there is someone to call. The man says no, then yes, then no again. He takes Reine’s wrist and says, You’ve got the look of a person who thinks too much to sleep. Reine smiles. I sleep on odd days, he says. There is a laugh between them. The man says, Will you stay two minutes. Reine says yes. They do not speak for those minutes. The machines do their metronome. The window shows the Bay coming in, the tide being the tide. Reine leaves and writes the man’s name on a sheet and draws a bracket next to it and writes Medium risk there. He feels the thickness of the bracket in his thumb. He thinks, again, of the ants, and tells himself this is nothing and also not nothing, which is his least favourite category.

Hours lean into one another and the city tries a scent of summer and then thinks better of it. A week, two. The ants keep appearing. Someone from the paper writes a piece that calls the anonymous artist the Marcher. Someone on the radio calls in and says that the ants gave her nightmares. Someone else says they made him feel hopeful in a way he had forgotten was a flavor. A private school parent says it is vandalism of space; a boy who saw the painting unframed said it was like seeing the window itself hang on a nail. Names out there. Cornelius stays in here. He cuts more canvas rectangles from a roll he bought cheap. He denies himself the memory of a woman who said next time and then did not because if he remembers it, it will undo a seam that is holding him in a shape. He does not eat enough and then eats too much: bread, relentless in its plainness.

He starts to plan. Not with the precision of a schematist, but with the steady slant of a person writing to a rhythm only they hear. He writes, In one act. He writes, I am going to give them an ending because no one else does, not truly; they give you a stop, a finish line, a ribbon that only looks red. He draws a map of the city in dull pencil and lightly shades in the parks and reserves and the vacant lots where the ground is broken and, under it, nests. He marks a warehouse, a hardware store, the place on Fifteenth where he saw, once, under an old set of tyres, a swarm that moved like a thought you cannot interrupt. He draws a little arrow there. He sketches a bottle. He writes, One attack. He puts the pencil down because it has made a noise, a small snap at the tip, a broken lead that will leave dust like pepper on the paper. He goes to the sink and washes his hands and watches the water run clouded, then clear. He says out loud to the empty, “It will be clean.” He hates himself a little for the way he said clean.

Reine gets a call at 3:17 a.m. from a colleague who cannot keep the bored tone out of her voice. There’s been a small fire at a footpath mural near the not-actually-open convenience store by the harbour. Not a big one. No injuries. Maybe kids. The ants again—someone tried to put a match to them. He sits up. He can feel his back in segments, like a phone battery showing bars. “I’ll go,” he says. He could also not go. But this is the hour when nurses wake and detectives sleep and he is both, so he dresses in the half-light and puts his badge in his pocket and drives through streets that are mostly composed of their own absence.

The mural is a chalk circle around a painting, a notch of burn at one corner. The chalk is smudged to the word please looking like peace and step looking like sleep. He crouches. The painting itself is a canvas board such as art students use for practice. The ants on it are arranged in a spiral, carrying pins and thorns and the little lids of milk bottles from café deliveries, the foil bent. The fire licked at them and they look more alive for it. Something about the singe line moves like a tail. He feels someone behind him and straightens with his hand on his thigh. It is a man in a hi-vis vest who asks if he is the owner of the art. “No,” Reine says. “Just someone who visits funerals before they happen.”

The man nods as if this answer is usual. “You want me to wash the chalk off?” he asks. “Seems to frighten the early walkers.”

“Leave it,” Reine says, because of course he is going to contradict the world. “Leave it a day. Let them step over it.” He then says thank you three times in different shapes, to cover for being odd, and goes back to his car feeling like an old coat.

Cornelius watches from a shadow because he does that. He tells himself he is watching his own mistake: leaving it too close to a spot where someone might get it into their head to light anything. He sees the man who crouches and then stands: not tall, not small, exactly the way a man should be, probably. He thinks: I have spoken to him before. It is possible. The city does that. It cycles faces through like shoes. He feels the old itch that is not exactly envy, more like a rash where pride should be. He thinks of how some people are healed by belonging and some are made sick by it. He says into his hands, “I will take them all at once.”

Irregular days. Reine drinks coffee that tastes like the beginning of a complaint. He is told to join an outreach meeting because people are worried about an artist who leaves things on steps. The meeting occurs in a room that smells like powdered lemon. The PowerPoint says words like engagement and mindfulness and community buy-in, which always sounds messily dental. He presses his knuckle to his lip and keeps his face from becoming insulting. He wanted something else: he wanted to look at the backs of the paintings again, to see the shaky proofs of a person. He wanted to go to the hardware store and ask how much of what quantity might be purchased without a counterperson raising an eyebrow. He wanted to sit by the water and wait for a person who might be an ogre to come and feed birds and not quite meet anyone’s eye. He has impulses that do not file to a department. He takes notes in nonsensical ways. Underlined: ants, rejection, threshold. He writes this too: stop him. He does not know yet he is writing the ogre’s name sideways.

Cornelius is outside the hardware store with a list that makes sense to no one reading: thinner, a pan for oil but not oil, a mask, a roll of fusing tape, a funnel. He feels obscene. He is not going to do it yet; he is going to think about doing it and see if thinking is enough. He tries to smile at the man who asks if he needs help. He says, “Special project.” The man says, “Too right,” and picks up the pan and says this one is good for fat that spits. Cornelius nods. He wonders if inside the skull of the man in the apron there is a place for the ants he will send spilling in a silence that is composed of many small screams, if ants scream at all or if only human imagination does. He carries the purchases like a citizen and returns them to his room and places them like relics and sits with the lights off because sometimes darkness feels like a permission slip.

At the hospital, a girl with a swollen lip says she fell. Reine draws the story out of the lip without making the girl feel like a page. He tells a social worker and they coordinate something that may or may not save anything. He texts a colleague about the ants and writes, I have a stomach feeling. The colleague writes back an emoji with big eyes and says, about insects? He writes, about a man. The colleague sends back a second emoji that is less certain. He puts the phone face down on the nurse’s station and looks at the clock, which looks back like it is giving up on being round.

There is a night when the sea air is thinner, like someone up there has opened a door. Cornelius opens his door too and steps out into the alley with the milk crate and the funnel and his mind like a blade he could cut himself on without meaning to. He walks to the vacant lot he mapped and stands at the edge and listens. He can hear them. If you have ever listened, you know. A whispering that is sheer motion. He kneels. He can see the vent—an opening along a root—where they come and go in pairs, bearing and returning. He unscrews a bottle, and the smell climbs his face. He pulls it back down with a breath that he has to practice. He does not pour. He will not—not tonight. He feels his hand shake, then stop. He is not clean enough for this. He caps the bottle and walks home with the funnel heavy in his pocket like an accusation.

He writes on a thin strip of paper, folded over and over until it is a square: Not yet, not yet, not yet.

Reine wakes at four and cannot go back. He drives to the Mount and actually runs up it, stopping once to let his heart slam. At the top, he does not make a vow. He watches the light smudge the horizon and says instead, “I will listen,” and it feels better because it feels possible. On his way down, he sees a boy drawing ants with a piece of charcoal on a bit of driftwood, and he stops and asks the boy what he likes about ants. The boy says, They’re all the same, but if you look close they’re not. Reine says, That’s true. The boy’s mother nods and smiles in that way of mothers who are simultaneously hoping the stranger is okay and knowing they are strong enough to manage it if he is not. Reine walks away with his hands in his pockets. He thinks of sameness and not. He thinks of a man born with the wrong size of bones under the skin that is a color only poets say out loud. He thinks of the word ogre and feels it like a cough he does not like to claim.

The last of the chapter ends in a hush that is not an end. Cornelius sits with his plan weighed in his lap like a pet that is not tame. He counts to sixty, then to one hundred, then forgets how numbers work and start again at three. He writes a sentence on the wall in pencil where the paper is insufficient: One act and they will understand. He says it and the room says it back in a breath that might have been water moving in the pipes. Reine closes the folder and looks at the window and the window looks like a confession that nobody wrote. He tells himself again—quietly, like a man placing a dressing—that he has to stop him. The city draws a breath it does not know it draws, and the ants, across their hundred busy republics, continue their grammar without a break for news.On mornings when the clouds sit low like unmade beds and the gulls sound like sirens run through three rooms of echo, Tauranga is a vocabulary more than a place. The harbour mouths vowels and the roads try to be consonants, and in that grammar lies the argument of a day. Reine wakes to this argument with his cheek creased by a ledger’s elastic band and a plant leaf touching the back of his hand as if checking for pulse. He lies still and listens to a city that does not know how carefully it is being listened to. There is a faint whirr from the refrigerator, the intermittent cough of a motorbike several blocks away, the burr of wet tyres. He hears then, not with ears but with the part of him that trained to catch a death before it leaned too heavily on a chest, that the pattern of the ant paintings and the silence between them has changed shape. You felt it in the photographs, he tells himself, and now you feel it in the air that hasn’t yet been touched by any new thing. He does not like this kind of premonition because it makes him feel like the kind of person who uses the word premonition. He tells himself: you are a nurse; you are a detective; you are a man who will go and stand where you might meet the man whose hands are wider than door handles. He tells himself: this is a listening day, not a speaking one.

Cornelius wakes to the old smell of mackerel lifting microscopic fishbone from rafters, to the drip at the back of the sink that is almost a rhythm, to his own breath insisting he went too far in a dream he cannot keep in his hand. He sits up too quickly, knocks his head on the low shelf, curses without heat, and rubs the place gently as if that could reverse the design of his skull. He is not sentimental about being big; he is only realistic about it. He thinks of the girl on the bus stop with hair like burnt field and hears the sentence she made with next time and how it never found its object. He has placed that sentence in a corner like a photograph turned upside down. He stands and drinks water until his stomach stops telling him it is a bird and his throat a cage. He pulls the funnel from the deep pocket of his coat and places it on the table, next to the pan for a fat that will not be fat, next to a coil of clear tubing he acquired from a skip behind the hospital where someone had set a box outside labeled expired as if expiry were a polite front door. He did not steal; he was accompanied by the logic that if the city discards something, it might belong to the ant now.

There is a recipe to this. You do not pour. You coax. You think like a scent and not like a shout. He heats sugar with a pinch of salt and a splash of lemon to keep it from crystallizing into nostalgia. He leaves it to cool to a viscosity like a held-back opinion. He threads the tubing through a slat in a wooden crate where he has lined the bottom with a strip of cardboard painted in a narrow line, thin enough to insist and not so thick that it becomes a lake. He drips a tap from the end onto the concrete and watches a single ant appear from a hairline crack like a priest late for a service. It tastes and returns and then returns with two, then four, then more. He times them because he wants to know if he is writing with living ink or only painting with patience. He writes on a receipt in pencil: three minutes to six ants; seven minutes to twenty; nineteen minutes to a seam. He turns the tap off and watches the seam unseam as the scent loses its imperative. He shapes the words in his head he has wanted to shape in a room with microphones and bored men nodding at each other’s nods: please step over, please do not call this a pest until it eats your words, please understand that a colony is a form of love we fear because it does not center us.

Reine showers and dresses in an empty mood—light shirt, jacket that lets him tuck his badge in the inside pocket where it can sit like a heartbeat he has chosen. He takes his coffee black by mistake and does not fix it; he drinks like he is apologizing to the coffee and the coffee accepts what it is given. He goes to the station, to the room with the uncountable scars, and opens the folder again as if his eyes can find in the paper fibers what his hands could not pick up from the damp. He looks at the titles again: Small Marches, Carapace Meadow, City with 60,000 Knees. He writes down on a clean page: thresholds. He circles the word and then draws a line to the list of where each painting was left. He writes: school, council, library, supermarket. He writes: a place where knowledge is borrowed; a place where power is performed; a place where knowledge pretends to be free; a place where survival is counted in coins. He thinks of the council’s notices pinned in a corridor that smells like varnish and the way the city talks about pests with the logician’s calm that hides a gladness in control. He goes to the council website and scans an agenda; there it is, drier than bread and twice as filling: Urban Pest Management Revisions, line item 7B, targeting wasps, rats, Argentine ants among other species, public comment allotted two minutes per speaker. He leans back and closes his eyes. He says the words Argentine ants in his head as if the label could itself be expelled by mouth. He sees Cornelius at a table, eyes moving faster than his tongue, and knows that the table would not be offered. He underlines the meeting time. He texts the junior constable with the eager shame and writes: meet me at council chambers tonight; don’t wear your uniform; bring no officers unless you have to; do not create panic with your face. The constable sends back a thumbs up and a sticker of a cartoon ant lifting a dumbbell, which annoys and endears and does not change the plan.

At the hospital, before his shift threatens to absorb him whole, Reine takes a detour past the loading dock. He is looking for absence—things that were once inside and are now outside. He sees a box collapsed like a chest after a sigh with the word tubing printed in a font that does not know of any emergencies. He crouches and finds it empty. He tells himself: it is a hospital; things are used; things are thrown away. He tells himself: you are not paranoid; you are paying attention. He walks past the skip and sees in the moss along its concrete boundary the neat attendance of ants, the way their road keeps to the brick like maps keep to borders. He remembers a fact he once read on a laminated sheet in a school he helped with vaccinations at: ants do not march; they commute. He goes back inside and writes his patients’ names on a board that is too white for the amount of living it has reflected and makes sure that the girl with the swollen lip’s appointment is later today and not next week because time is a thing that kills.

Cornelius wraps the tubing around his forearm because the coil fits there same as a cuff. He tucks it under his coat and the funnel into his bag with two bottles of syrup capped with screw tops that do not leak because he has learned to fear leaks more than reproaches. He does not bring paint thinner. It sits on the table where the light from the one window touches its label and pronounces it toxic-haunted in a whisper. He writes on the back of a cereal carton: One act is not a fire, one act is a sentence with only one verb. He makes tea and does not remember drinking it. He tests the weight of the crate he has built—pine, left out on the curb by a shop that used to sell shoes and now sells nothing but a story that it almost sold shoes once. He slides the crate into a milk trolley that he found the day after a storm, all its wheels intact, a little rust banded around the bottom like a wedding ring you can’t pry loose. He practises moving the trolley quietly. He practises the angle of his shoulders when he is asked what is that and he answers nothing. He does not quite practise the voice he will use because he is saving his throat for the hall.

By afternoon, the Bay has forgotten to be cold. The sun fumbles a little with the clouds and then commits. People become more themselves as their jackets unbutton. Reine drives to the hardware store that calls itself a warehouse as if size could absolve it, and speaks to the man in the apron who has a face like a reassuring cupboard. He asks, did you have, in the last week, a customer who bought a funnel, a pan, tape for electrics, a lot of sugar if you also sell sugar. The man shrugs the shrug that shopkeepers learn to keep their faces from being subpoenas. He says, a big fella did ask me about a pan that could handle fat that bites, and he did buy fusible tape because his switch was hissin’ he said, and he had hands like he could squeeze my head into a smaller head. He wasn’t rude, the man adds, like offering a counterweight. Reine says, thank you, because always, and slides a card across with his thumb, just in case regret later needs a valve. He stops by the aisle with insecticides he will not touch and reads labels that speak of colonies as if they were stubborn weeds. He thinks of the word colony in another register and does not finish the thought.

At three, Cornelius positions himself across the street from the council building as if trying to learn its face. The building pretends to be glass and light; inside it is beige and carpet and switches that require keys. He watches the security guard who reads a paper with all folded corners, the way the guard laughs at a cartoon as if remembering laughter from a better year. He counts the vents along the base of the outer wall. One is the size of his palm. He checks the gaps he has drawn on his map, accounts for foot traffic and pram radius and how quickly someone with a mop could erase a day. He moves when the guard moves, a little later, a little behind, just another north-south shuffle. He goes down the side lane everybody uses to have private arguments on their phones and sets the crate down and ties his shoe though he wears boots and no laces. He threads, swift as his fingers allow, the clear line beneath the bottom lip of the door that opens to the chamber’s vestibule. The rubber seal is old and brittle and thinks it is defending the building from weather. He slides under it with the soft insistence he learned in nights when he tried to ask for anything. He tapes the tube along the inside corner with smooth strips because noise has to be managed. He pulls the tube’s end back out and tucks it under the lip of a concrete plinth where a potted ficus suffers without complaint.

Inside, past the door, he imagines the tubed end drips onto the shadow of the skirting board and makes a faint shining comma. He has practised his mixture precisely to make a path that does not run toward the center but calls and calls until small legs write the rest. He pushes the trolley, pushes his palms into the handle with a pressure he knows would dent softer metal, and circles to the service entrance. The second line goes in under a gap where the wind has taught the seal humility. He stands back and for the first time all day his heart stops monitoring his ribcage for signs of escape. He thinks: clean. He hates again that the word comes. He thinks of the ants themselves and says in his head in the voice he reserves for things he does not deserve to love, I borrow you because they borrow me by crossing my front step and because there is nothing they leave behind when they go except their order.

Reine sits through two patients with feverish toddlers and one with a pain that none of the monitors can find because the pain has rent in one hand and mortgage in the other. He leaves early with the permission of a woman who has worked in the ward twelve years longer than him and who draws with her finger in the air an outline of his face that is both affectionate and warning. He gets to the council building an hour before the meeting starts and walks the perimeter like a guard dog that was trained by a librarian. He sees chalk dust at the base of one pillar, a faint dry ring like a licked doughnut, and he rubs it with his knuckle and smells nothing except street. He crouches and touches a crumb of sticky he is embarrassed to think is invisible to everyone else. He stands and sees the ficus, sees nothing about it at all because it is exactly the plant a council buys when it cannot afford a more expressive tree. He looks up and sees his junior constable sitting on a bench pretending to read a pamphlet about rates and knows from the way the pages do not turn that he is correct. He texts: inside now. He steps through the front door.

The vestibule is a modest room trying for grace and falling into acoustic tile. On a pedestal stands a bronze of a tuna because someone somewhere thought it apt. A woman with hair the color of burnt field brushes past him; he does not know she is a shape from another man’s map. She pauses at the bulletin board, scans, and makes a face like disappointment’s friend. She carries a notebook and a pen with an outrageously fat grip, the kind used by people teaching their hands to be hands. She remembers the ants from the bus stop room and the way she said next time and the line did not connect to its other line. She has come because the paper sent her but also because she wanted to promise herself that art can do things besides sit in rooms and be judged.

The sugar on the skirting board is not yet a sentence. It is a line you could miss if you have never had to learn to find sweetness where no one else leaves it. In a crack near a power box, a scout turns and runs like a question. He returns with others. The line acquires legs. The skirting board, cheap softwood painted institutional grey, begins to look like something a river might do in respect to a stone. Reine watches without knowing he is watching the exact moment that a yes is taken up by many mouths. He does know the smell, however faint, of a hand that has worked with tape. He looks for a line that might feed the line. He finds, by a seam, the tip of tubing that shines a very little, like a snail shell in shade. He follows the tube with his eyes to the pillar, rounds it and sees, beyond the threshold, the angle of a man’s coat and the deliberate shaping of his shoulders against the brick. He does not say stop. He says, quietly, as if speaking to a sleeping person, “All right.”

The word is a silly tiny raft. It floats between them. Cornelius does not want the raft. He wants the flood. His hands tighten on the trolley handle until the metal respects him with a small whine. He turns and is not surprised by the face in front of him because he has prepared to be not surprised by anything. The man is not tall and not small and his eyes have a nurse’s quiet around them. Cornelius hears himself, against his will, saying the thing that has been bashing its head in his throat for months, “They won’t step until they have to.” Reine answers without thinking, which is how his best answers have happened, “Then let me tell them to.”

“I don’t trust your telling,” Cornelius says, and there is a history in that sentence unrelated to this man in his good jacket. He thinks of cards with writing that say sorry all occupied and of mothers moving between him and their small preoccupations. He thinks of the guard who laughs at cartoons and wonders how that laugh will sound with ants crossing his boots. He says another sentence because it feels like a handhold, “I am not hurting anyone. I am bringing them a word.”

Reine feels his back itch with the presence of doors and meetings and the kind of authority that hates any plan that arrives without stationery. He says, “I’m not here to steal your word,” and even as he says it he hears how absurd and exactly right it sounds. He looks down and sees the seam thickening along the baseboard, the commas becoming clauses. He cannot unsee the kindness of the line. He thinks of the council item in the agenda and the way the word pest sits next to the word community as if they were cousins forced to share a bed. He says, “If you flood the chamber you will not be given a minute, you will be given a broom and a charge and a name that is smaller than you. If you let me, I can make them come here and step. Outside. The way your circles ask. Let me make them step over something that is not their own sentence.”

Cornelius does not trust any man who stands with his weight on both feet and speaks like a bandage. He does not trust the way the man has put the word step in his mouth like a grape he could crush and will not. But he feels—because he is adapted for feeling where he is not invited—the line inside the vestibule thickening into a thing that will bring children crying and women lifting bags up their calves and men pretending to be unafraid of what cannot be argued with. He whispers, which is not a thing he is built for, “You bring them to the door. If they step over, if they step over my word, I close the line.” He gestures with his chin to the tangle hidden in the crate, to the screw-top lids, to the funnel sleeping in the bag like a moon.

The woman with the burnt field hair looks up from the bulletin board because she has felt the change in the air that says an intention has been let out of a pocket. She steps into the vestibule and the ants are there, travelling like sentences without adjectives. She pauses and does not squeal because she is not a squealer; she is the kind of person whose noise is saved for nights when being alive requires cheering. She reads the chalk on the threshold—please step over—because he has written it there with his hand that can balance fine even though the letters are not fine, they are thick like children write when they want you to see. She steps over. Her heart does something kindly to her chest. She looks at the base of the pillar and sees part of a man, massive as architecture. She knows him because you do not forget the way a body holds itself when it wants to be left and cannot quite yet. She says, not loudly, “I thought your ants would find a house.” He flinches gently. It is not a flinch of fear. It is the movement that happens when someone tests a stitch and finds it still holding.

Inside, a volunteer arranges little paper cups of water and the count of biscuits per plate that satisfies a rule nobody can quite quote. The councillors, some with hair that will not try for more and others with hair that believes in itself unnaturally, take their seats and open their laptops to agendas they have decided to skim only when they are pressed for reasons. The chair taps a pen on wood because wood likes to be told it is work. Reine steps through the inner door lightly and across the carpet that eats footfalls. He goes to the chair and leans in with his badge like a postcard no one wants to read. He says a few sentences that begin with the word public and end with the word safety but those are not the words he relies on. He says, “There is art at your front step,” and the chair, who in school once learned that the fastest way to look serious is to refuse to look curious, says, “Is it dangerous?” Reine says, “Only if you refuse to see it.” The chair rolls this around in his mouth like a seed and decides, being a man who once loved theatre and then forgot to tell himself he loved it, to indulge three minutes. He stands and declares a short recess and calls it a procedural check because power is sometimes just naming what you do.

They come in a small crowd whose shoes, polished and not, have learned to walk on carpet with an entitlement of soundlessness. A cameraphone rises and then is lowered because something about the vestibule insists on ceremony. They see, first, the chalk—please step over—then the line like an eyebrow drawn along the wall. They step awkwardly like people step when they realize their legs are new or remembered. The junior constable, standing to the side with a pamphlet held open, does not grin. He has been told not to have a face and he is managing it. The woman with burnt field hair stands with her arms loose, letting the ants make her small. She glances at Cornelius and he looks away because for a moment he has the feeling that to meet her eyes would stack three found alleys on top of each other and he would not breathe properly between them.

Reine stands where he can see both the ants and the man and the council. He says nothing. He does not explain art to power or power to art. He watches boots and heels and trainers, watches a councillor with a limp lift his leg a little higher and step, a precise, delicate action like cutting a baby’s fingernail. He watches the chair’s face do a small choreography as the ants continue to use the sentence made for them, the syntax of sugar that will go away when the tap is turned. For a second, the room is every room where a rule changed because somebody wrote it in front of somebody else. Then a man in a suit, who has mislaid his sense of drama somewhere between a mortgage and a bowling night, makes a tutting sound and says, “This is very irregular.” He looks at the floor as if accusing it of not being floor enough.

Cornelius feels the tut land in the center of his chest and goes to reach into the crate for the tap, which is to say he goes to control what he can. Reine steps closer, shows his open palm like a nurse shows it before a bandage, and says, “Wait. Let me ask them to say a thing.” He turns to the chair and the others and says, “Would the council, in the minutes, record that when citizens leave work at your step that is not violent, you will step over before you sweep.” He can feel a ripple of irritation at the word minute because minutes are supposed to be invisible servants, not moral diaries. He says, because he only has a certain number of brave sentences a day and he is using one, “Would you say for the recording that a colony is not always a pest, and that sometimes it is a metaphor you bow your head to.”

The chair could say no. The man in the suit beside him could make a noise big enough to erase. The woman with burnt field hair could be writing the words in a notebook that will make them sound pretentious in the morning edition because the morning insists on brightness without heat. There is a silence. The ants do not participate. They continue. The chair, looking at them, thinks without realizing he is thinking of a boy in a school assembly being told not to move and not quite managing it but also not quite disobeying. He says, because he is a man who wants to be a good story in a small way today, “The minutes will note that council members observed a citizen installation and stepped over it. The minutes will record that we will step over again before we sweep.” He adds, reflexively, “Within reason,” because power is a muscle that twitches that way, but the sentence is said.

Cornelius puts his hand on the valve and turns it shut gently, and the word he has written, invisible, starts to finish itself like a echo fading. He wants to laugh and cannot; he wants to sob and will not; he settles for standing with his hands behind him to keep the blood settled where it belongs. He lowers his head. He does not bow. He is never allowed to bow without someone thinking it is apology. The woman with the burnt field hair says, “Next time I will drink your tea,” and he nods as if he can handle future tense. He feels the way light moves through the dirty glass and lands on one knuckle and makes it look like a different person’s joint.

The meeting returns to its chamber with a different temperature. A boy with a hoodie and a backpack sits down on the steps outside and pulls his phone out to text someone: bro the politicians did ants. A sparrow hops in at the elevation of one of the doors and takes two pecks at something left along the threshold and leaves in the slow way of birds that are not in a hurry to be alarmed. Inside, one councillor uses the word eradicate with more caution and another who wanted to be seen thinking in public asks if mitigation could be more layered. The chair breathes and realizes he had held his breath for a silly amount of time and that maybe he is not as practiced at this as he thought. Reine goes to the side and swaps a look with the junior constable that is three movements—a question, a thank you, a later. He feels in his bones a small easing like a muscle letting go after a cramp. He glances back to where Cornelius has been and sees an empty piece of brick like someone’s weathered brow.

Cornelius does not go home immediately because home feels like an answer and he is not ready to be answered. He pushes the trolley down streets that have gained coin light from subdivided sun. He stops at the edge of the vacant lot and pours the last ribbon of sugar the ants way, not enough to be an insult to their systems, only enough to thank the scouts who taught him patience this morning. He thinks of the man’s hand held open and how that had made him feel simultaneously escorted and asked. He thinks of the minutes being minutes and wonders what it would be like to be on a page like that, not as a joke, not as an arrest, but as a sentence with a verb that tells the truth. He writes on a strip of cardboard with his pencil that needs to be sharpened: Reine, he writes, because he has heard a name in a corridor and a man’s colleagues are not careful enough with the privacy of those who take care. He adds underneath, The nurse who says a thing at a door so that somebody can walk through it. He does not know if he will give this to anyone. He tucks it behind the paint thinner because irony is a habit he does not always choose.

Reine drives home to the plant that resurrects. He waters it like you water a horse, small and steady to avoid startling it, and he sits on the couch with his calves on the arm because he is not as tall as he thinks he is and the couch is not as short as it plays. He opens his notebook and writes the words: He closed the line. He writes, They stepped. He writes, The chair said it for the record. He draws a bracket and writes next to it in the tidy script his grandmother taught him with a ruler under his wrist: not over. He feels the kind of tired that is not a request for sleep but a letting down of something held too high too long. He remembers the bees that once got into theatre curtains at his school and how the custodian refused to call an exterminator and instead stood with a sugar trail leading to a box because it was not the bees’ fault they had found a soft light. He closes his eyes and hears walking upstairs, a neighbour with a dog or a neighbour without one, hard to tell through the ceiling’s version of truth. He says out loud, quietly, “Thank you,” and if it is to the chair, to the man, to the ants, he does not have to declare.

Later, in the storeroom that is a room because he says so, Cornelius unrolls a fresh strip of canvas and lays it on the floor and kneels as he always has, with his spine tilted against the lath and his hands hovering until they are sure they are hands and not machines. He paints ants he has never seen because they are not ants but the plural of step. He paints their shadows narrower than the day because the day has narrowed a little around him to make way. He writes on the back, not his best calligraphy but his most honest, The minutes will note. He then adds, in smaller writing, which is to say closer to his own ear, The clean is a word I forgive. He puts the brush down and waits, and in the pause he hears the city not sigh but agree to continue. He is not tender forever. He is tender enough for this night. He lets that be.
