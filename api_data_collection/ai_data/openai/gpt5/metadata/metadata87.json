     "novel_text": "The morning broke on glass and steel, the city bright and hard. Runlights stitched between towers like impatient comets, ferrying slogans: service, unity, her. It was always her\u2014every face on billboards an elected smile, every elevator whispering back the latest from the Book, the public ledger and noticeboard and mirror where lives were supposed to stay pinned. He rode up in one of those whispering elevators, eyes on the scuffed toes of his shoes, listening to the voice of the building tell him which floor he belonged to.\n\n\u201cMinistry of Civic Flow,\u201d the voice chimed, clean as a bell and somehow satisfied with itself. \u201cAdministrative subfloor, records, postings, deletions. Good morning, Tomas Rook.\u201d\n\nHe adjusted the thin ring on his index finger, the Book-ring, the hot little shackle that made sure he was never fully alone. The ring warmed gently, a pulse against the skin that could be polite or urgent depending on what was demanded of him. He had been told once that the ring measured loyalty in microvolts\u2014your enthusiasm, your compliance, your little daily offerings of like and share and kneel. He worked for women who believed in such measures, who believed the city would not hold together without them. Maybe they were right. He didn\u2019t have the power to argue, he had only the dates and times of other people\u2019s lives.\n\nHe stepped out into the corridor, then into the open space of the Ministry floor. Women in tailored suits walked fast between glass-walled conference boxes, their hair and shoes making a fine sound on polished concrete. The plants along the edge of the atrium had their own watering schedule posted on the Book; one of the interns was already checking the soil with a digital wand. He never knew the names of the interns, they came in clusters and left in clusters, sharp and quick and immediately friendly and then gone. He knew every one of their profile pictures.\n\nAt the desk, he paused to look down into the atrium below, the murals of victory curling around the walls. A bronze ball was carved over the main door, a throwback to the old leagues, the final symbol appropriated after the Charter. Women had taken the game and made it their own, cleanly, proudly, with a flag that was half stadium lights and half rising sun. There was a museum across town where the first women's championship ball sat under glass on a velvet pillow. At least that was the picture. His father had taken him there when he was small, before it became impolite to be seen in the Hall unless you were in uniform or escorted. He remembered the hush of the room and the ball, scuffed and brown but more precious than jewels.\n\n\u201cTomas,\u201d said a voice like something unsheathed. \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d\n\nHe turned. Mira Vost was not a tall woman\u2014one had to be careful with assumptions\u2014but she carried weight like the anvil under the coin. Her hair was white though she was not yet fifty, the white that certain women wore as a banner. She had been in four administrations and looked likely to survive more. She wore a pin shaped like a clock, and she always reminded him that she had time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Chancellor,\u201d he said, because she insisted on the title even in private. \u201cThe elevator lingered.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe elevator does not linger. It delays for security. You will remember the difference.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, hands already moving toward the tablet on which her day lived. In the narrowness of his half-cubicle, between the glass and the door, he took down notes as she slid her jacket onto the back of her chair and began to dictate.\n\n\u201cThere was vandalism last night,\u201d she said. \u201cHall of Heritage. An artifact missing. The feeds are alive. We will contain this. Draft me a statement for noon: outrage measured by specificity; sorrow for history; promise of consequence. Insert a line about legacy belonging to all citizens, to blunt the class criticism. Avoid the phrase \u2018boys with toys.\u2019 I would not have used it, but the Mayor has. Could you look any paler? Drink something.\u201d\n\nHe swallowed. \u201cWhich artifact, Chancellor?\u201d\n\nHer mouth tightened. \u201cA ball.\u201d\n\nHis hand stopped on the tablet. He knew which ball before she said it. Of course he did. There were others in the Hall\u2014rackets, medals, the first ceramic baton from the relay in the year of the Fires\u2014but only one ball mattered to everyone. A case of velvet, a liar\u2019s clear wall, the signatures of the first ten captains etched in an arc like a crown. His chest had a small, unhelpful ache in it.\n\n\u201cIn the Book, it\u2019s trending under three different tags,\u201d he said mechanically. \u201cWe can consolidate. Limit the spread of rumor.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo that,\u201d she said. She had already pulled up her own feed on the wall screen, her face reflected ghostly over the text. \u201cMake sure the official account posts the right image. I don\u2019t want that ugly photo from the centennial. And call the Hall to confirm the timeline. They will be in shock. Insist anyway.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. He felt the pulse of the ring, a curt attention-please from a thousand voices. He looked down.\n\nMandatory Poll: Where do you place the theft on your scale of betrayal? Choose one. The ring pulsed again, encouraging him to hurry. He clicked an answer without reading; choice had lost flavor years ago.\n\nHe pulled up the Book\u2019s admin view on his terminal. It was not the main admin console\u2014he was a secretary, not a Keeper\u2014but he had certain privileges granted on a need-to-please basis. He could see trending data, language clusters. He could sense, faintly, the heat of the city's mood. Today the heat was a red name: the ball, the Ball, the folly, the crime.\n\nLila Qadir leaned on the partition. \u201cHeard?\u201d\n\nHe flinched, then forced his shoulders to unknot. Lila didn\u2019t wear a suit, she wore a uniform, and it made a different statement. The Ministry badge sat on her chest like a seal on wax. Her hair was shaved at the sides and plaited down the back. They had known each other since the flood, when she pulled him off a bus roof with a rope and cursed like a poet while she did it.\n\n\u201cI heard,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not assigned to this floor.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot officially.\u201d Her smile was quick and dry. \u201cMira wants someone to stand by the door today and look like a consequence. I drew the short stick. Or long, depending. Depends who notices.\u201d\n\n\u201cMira always notices.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s her hobby. What\u2019s yours, Rook?\u201d\n\nHe looked away before the answer could stick his throat shut. He had, as hobbies, secret disloyalties: hitting a ball against the wall of his kitchen with a rolled-up pair of socks at two a.m.; saving old newspaper clippings; memorizing the names of anonymous men who were temporarily significant and then vanished from the feed. He shrugged. \u201cDrafting speeches.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be glum,\u201d she said. \u201cYou do it well.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\n\nHe watched her in the glass. She was looking at him as if she could pick up off him any unspoken thing. Soldiers sometimes had that knack. Or guards. She pointed with her chin at his hand. \u201cYour ring\u2019s blinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt always is.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a heart.\u201d Lila leaned closer, not quite friendly, not quite not. \u201cYou see the Hall feed? There\u2019s a rumor the ball wasn\u2019t signed at all. That the signatures were added after, when the Charter was signed, to make the myth smooth. That the original had a crack. You ever notice a crack?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was a child,\u201d he said. He remembered his father. Soft hands, rough voice. Cheering at the wrong time during a match and then laughing at himself for it. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking for cracks.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking now,\u201d she said mildly, and moved on down the corridor to where two women were arguing about meeting times. She became a consequence and the arguing stilled.\n\nHis ring required him to witness a statement from the Mayor; he clicked the witness without reading. He opened a call to the Hall of Heritage and waited until the screen resolved to a tired face. The curator, gray hair pulled back, glasses catching the light.\n\n\u201cWe are closed,\u201d she began. \u201cWe are closed and grieving.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling from the Ministry,\u201d he said. \u201cCivic Flow. On behalf of the Chancellor, I need to confirm the details. The ball is missing?\u201d\n\n\u201cCall it theft,\u201d she said. \u201cElegance in language won\u2019t bring it back.\u201d She blinked and then seemed to see him, to see his ring. \u201cYou\u2019re Tomas Rook. You came here once with your father. You stood on tiptoe to see better. He lifted you and the guard told him not to carry you because of \u2018policy.\u2019 He put you down, and you had the sense to stand still.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014,\u201d he said, and felt like a page torn out of an old book. She smiled at his surprise.\n\n\u201cI remember what matters,\u201d she said. \u201cThis city wears amnesia like a tiara. My name is Ana\u00efs Vel. Come to the Hall, Mister Rook. Don\u2019t ask me why on a channel someone else might be listening to. Come to the back door. Bring coffee. The good kind.\u201d\n\nHe glanced at Mira, visible through her office wall, and at Lila, now watching the elevators. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d Ana\u00efs said softly, \u201cyou will. The Book is thirsty today, and you look like a man who needs to drink something that isn\u2019t salt.\u201d\n\nHe went. He took the Chancellor\u2019s notes with him, because absence could be explained if it was packaged like diligence. He took two coffees, hot and dark, and he walked the long seven blocks to the Hall because walking was less suspicious than requisitioning a car. The city had the bright under-skin of a festival in panic: vendors shouting about limited commemorative pins, children whispering about the theft as if it were a song. A woman in a yellow coat asked him to take a photograph of her standing with the mural. He did, and she thanked him as if kindness might pay him back.\n\nThe Hall was set back from the street, white stone and columns like a temple, nothing to do with sport at all. The side door was painted to look like a door you weren\u2019t supposed to see. He knocked with his knuckles in the pattern of a child, three-twos and a pause. It was foolish and worked.\n\nAna\u00efs Vel opened. Up close she looked like sawn wood: rings of years visible, sturdy and beautiful. She smelled faintly of paper and oil. Behind her, the Hall glowed coldly.\n\n\u201cCome,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have somewhere to sit where the cameras are less intrusive.\u201d\n\nHe followed her through a gallery of uniforms and shoes, medals in their boxes and the larger medals that were buildings. The empty case came into view like an insult. The velvet was bare. He could see the outline where the ball had been, a shadow circle. The little plaque still read: WHEN WE BEGAN, WE BEGAN TOGETHER.\n\n\u201cThat was never true,\u201d she said, catching his glance. \u201cWe began and some people were told to stay at home and cheer, which is not the same as beginning anything. Your people\u2014no, don\u2019t flinch\u2014your people made a lot of noise in those days.\u201d\n\n\u201cMen with opinions,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cRare phenomenon.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t play humble,\u201d she snapped, kind. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t fit.\u201d\n\nShe took him into an office that contained a stool, a philodendron, and a lot of dust. She took the coffee. She watched him watch the dust.\n\n\u201cDo you want to hear the list of who is under suspicion,\u201d she said, \u201cor the list of what is under suspicion?\u201d\n\nHe considered. \u201cWhat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Book,\u201d she said immediately. \u201cThe ring. The guards. The fit of the case. The alarm\u2019s wiring. The notion that the ball existed in the present tense in any meaningful way.\u201d She drank. \u201cAnd me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was seen in the gallery late. With the ball. Looking at it. I have done that before. I am a curator. But this morning intention is assigned by last known direction.\u201d\n\nHe opened his mouth to ask something brave, but she nodded toward his ring. \u201cNo. We talk about brave things out loud when we want to be seen. And we will, but not now. Tell me: Do you think you could leave the Book?\u201d\n\nHis throat tightened. He touched the ring. In certain houses it had to be worn always; in others it could be taken off during prayers. He did not pray. \u201cLeave? It\u2019s illegal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked could, not should. The ball had a chip in it, Tomas. I am old enough to find that ridiculous because it was once just a ball and a game was a game. But chips creep into everything. The chip identifies the artifact. The chip opens the case. The chip says: I am here. When it is not here, the chip says something else. It says: unpair. It says: if this is gone, what else could be gone. Do you understand?\u201d\n\nHe thought of the console at his desk. The admin view. The faint sense of heat. The hidden settings he had never dared ask about. The Keepers had their own rooms. The Keepers had tattoos with QR codes under their hair. \u201cI might.\u201d\n\nAna\u00efs leaned forward. \u201cSomething happened when that ball left this building. A small hole was punctured in the Book\u2019s net to let the alarm write out, and the hole didn\u2019t close. There\u2019s a maintenance speed in the system when panic is high. Things are allowed to happen because making people wait might cause more noise. That is the only reason I asked you to come. You weren\u2019t the fastest messenger I could ask. You were the one I remembered being quiet as a boy, watching like someone who believes in something. I would like you to consider believing in this: there might be a way to step out of the field. But only while the hole is an unhole, when it looks like a necessary emptiness. Do you understand?\u201d\n\nHis heart did a very old thing. It flapped against his ribs, a bird that had realized its cage was made of string. \u201cAre you asking me to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI am telling you what I saw,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cAnd telling you that if I were young\u2014not in my bones but in my acts\u2014I would pick up that hole and put it in my pocket like a key. It will close. Oh, and for what it is worth: No, I did not steal the ball.\u201d\n\n\u201cMira sent me to write a statement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWrite it,\u201d Ana\u00efs said. \u201cWrite words that are not lies; write words that sound like truth. And if you decide to scratch something else into the bark while you are at it, well. I cannot stop you. This city is stratified by the difference between armistice and apathy.\u201d\n\nHer words made him feel both scolded and knighted. He stood. He walked back through the hall, looking at the absence until his eyes watered. He wrote the statement leaning on a pillar in the lobby, using phrases that felt like pebbles: we share this grief; history is a house we all live in; we will light every room. It was not lies. It was not enough.\n\nOn the way out, he paused. There was a scratch on the base of the case, a place where the metal had been hit\u2014not hard enough to dent, but enough to leave a burr. He crouched and touched it. His finger came away gray.\n\nHe smelled his finger. Tin. Dust. He looked under the case\u2019s rim, because he was foolish and curiosity might yet be a sacrament. There, under the seam, a tiny socket. Hexagonal. Old-fashioned. His father had owned a set of those keys, kept in a red metal box with the lid dented where he had dropped it. His father had shown him how to use a hex key, a slow twist, a patient twist, the knowledge that turning left at the right time would loosen something that had no interest in letting go. He had been six. He had felt like a magician.\n\nLila was at the door when he came back, holding up a hand to stop him. \u201cYou\u2019re sweating.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a warm day.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not. Where did you go?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the Hall. To write the Chancellor\u2019s statement.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope it is a good one,\u201d she said, but her eyes were on his face, and then, quick, on his ring. The ring hummed. He felt the hum reach bone. \u201cEveryone will share it. Everyone will say, Yes, this is the right tone. Then they will forget by dinner.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are getting cynical.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am getting old in a job where I do not want to get old,\u201d she said. For a second something like a smile cracked through. \u201cIf you need a thing you don\u2019t know you need, tell me. Or don\u2019t tell me. I will see your posture and guess your sins.\u201d\n\n\u201cUseful service.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the state,\u201d she said, bland, and turned her head when Mira\u2019s door opened.\n\nInside, they performed their parts. Mira read the draft, X\u2019d out two phrases, put in a better one, told him to post it. He posted. The Book drank the words and burped. Mira dictated directives to the security council. Lila\u2019s shadow moved once across the glass. The city rotated like a complicated toy. Somewhere a ball was not.\n\nBy evening he was back in his apartment, which was the size of a smile you weren\u2019t sure you wanted to return. He put the kettle on. He slid the ring off and set it on the counter so it could see the kettle and claim domesticity and therefore compliance. It was sensitive to rings of steam, it liked to think you were cooking, that you lived. He stood at the window and looked down at the street where men who still believed in conversation were talking with their hands and their faces and the slow tilt of heads. Women laughed. A man kicked an empty bottle with his heel, caught it on the point of his shoe and flipped it, and a small boy watched him with his mouth open in appreciation. The boy\u2019s mother tapped his ear and pointed him toward the door. The man stopped, tucked the bottle under his arm as if it were a ball, embarrassed by his own grace.\n\nHe made tea. He sat. He checked the Book twice and then put it face down. He took out of his pocket the piece of gray that had come off on his finger at the Hall and turned it in the lamplight. Tiny, an almost nothing. He felt like he had stolen the moon as a nail clipping.\n\nHe had a sister in another city, a teacher of children who rarely admitted their fathers in their drawings. She called sometimes to tell him about the weather. Tonight she called to ask if he had seen the panic in the feed.\n\n\u201cYou always hated that hall thing,\u201d she said, laughing at herself. \u201cYou once stood in front of the case and told me it was a stupid thing to put faith in. That it wouldn\u2019t ever make you run faster like they said.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was eight,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou were yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t get fired for saying the wrong true thing.\u201d\n\nAfter they said goodnight, he sat with the tea gone cold and said what he had not said aloud in years. He said: I do not belong to them as much as they think. His mouth formed the words and he understood that the forming of them was a commitment. The ring on the counter turned a low light, waiting for another performance of devoutness. He picked it up and secured it to his finger. It tightened minutely, like a promise.\n\nThe Book had a developer mode if you pressed three places on its skin while thinking of nothing. He had never found it by curiosity, he found it because a man at a bus stop had shown him once, furtive, in the hush of the flood night. Press here, here, here. Think about the sound of a ball striking a wall. Now you can see where the water goes when you pull the plug, the man had said. He had laughed then because everyone talked in riddles at two in the morning when the river was in the street. But the mode was real. It let you view the guts of your own feeds: the tags that had been attached to your name, the places your eyes had rested, the speed at which you scrolled past certain women\u2019s faces. It let you see the pipes.\n\nHe opened it now and looked for the Hall\u2019s feed, for the alarm\u2019s thread. He followed it like you follow a sound in the dark. He found a note in the log: ARTIFACT 00001 UNPAIRED. He found the list of automatic actions triggered by that note: Notify Keepers. Notify Mayor. Open lens for wider capture. Reduce throttle for deletion requests for three minutes to allow for legitimate unpairing of counter measures.\n\nReduce throttle. For three minutes.\n\nHe put his knuckle in his mouth like a child to keep from laughing. Or crying. He watched the clock. He watched the city\u2019s feed. He watched his own hand. He was not known for bravery; he had not been asked for it often. That was a mercy. He thought of his father and the red box and the patience of a slow twist. He thought of Ana\u00efs Vel and the accuracy of her anger. He thought of Lila and the way she had said, If you need a thing you don\u2019t know you need.\n\nHe typed. The Book did not like for you to leave. It used a language that pretended to be affectionate while being code: Are you sure? Are you safe? Will you miss us? Do you have somewhere to go? He kept typing. He pointed his account at a place where the Book had mis-labeled him in the past\u2014a page that was supposed to belong to objects, not people. He created a tiny, stupid page for a missing football, and then he tried to make himself into it. The Book shuddered, confused. He pressed three places on his own pulse, thought of the sound of a ball against the wall, and found the maintenance panel. Reduce throttle. Three minutes. He sent the request again, and again. He felt the ring tighten, and then warm, and then cool, as if it was deciding whether he was still a finger worth wrapping.\n\nThe Book spat an error at him. Then it spat another. Then, with that deep reluctance with which the powerful sometimes obey their own rules, it acknowledged the shape of his trick. He watched his own account translation begin: place, person, thing. He felt a chill, as if his name had been blown on by a mouth that did not wish him well.\n\nHe stopped. He didn\u2019t hit the last button. He didn\u2019t pull the plug. He backed away from the precipice because you do not jump without checking the water, and because there were people who would be hurt if he vanished tonight without a plan. He breathed until he could feel his own lungs and not the ring. He went to the window and looked at the street again, the night making its own arguments with the lamps.\n\nHe would need the detail that made it clean: the hex, the key, the physical echo that the system would expect. He would need to borrow the missing ball, which was not borrowable, or borrow something that played the part. A hollow at the center of a hollow. He would need someone to watch a door. He would need someone who knew how to talk to steel. He would need to be foolish and the right kind of fast.\n\nIn the morning he went to work and smiled at the proper times and watched the Chancellor turn the theft into a call to unity. The Mayor did a tour of the Hall and wept the exact number of tears recommended by her consultants. The feeds were full; the ring got hot. He slipped a line into a memo that changed a code by one and saw the Keepers frown. He went, on his lunch break, to a basement under a gym where men played a sly version of a game with a ball made of socks and twine. He watched them in the dust and half-light and felt his heart break because it was beautiful and something you were told not to want.\n\n\u201cYou new?\u201d a man said, pausing for breath.\n\n\u201cI had a father,\u201d Tomas said, and the man nodded as if that explained everything.\n\n\u201cName\u2019s Ezra,\u201d the man puffed, knocking grit off his knee. \u201cYou look like someone who could fetch a thing and not get caught.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Tomas said. \u201cDo you know how to get a key where a key does not want to exist?\u201d\n\nEzra laughed. \u201cThat is a religious question.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsider me a pilgrim.\u201d\n\nThey sat on the steps after the game because stairs were an old technology and generous. Ezra had been a courier once. He had the map of the city in his shoulders. He knew where doors liked to be. He knew where Lila Qadir liked to sit her people on cold mornings so they would feel awake. He knew a locksmith who had been made redundant by smart doors and who now made keys out of habit. He wrote the locksmith\u2019s name on a napkin in his careful handwriting as if the napkin was an oath.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll need more than a hex,\u201d Ezra said. \u201cYou\u2019ll need time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree minutes,\u201d Tomas said.\n\nEzra whistled between his teeth. \u201cYou\u2019re making friends with running water. Don\u2019t slip.\u201d\n\nHe returned to the Ministry and typed sequences that would be part of something. He sent Lila a message that said: The Hall\u2019s back door sticks on hot days. He did not add: Will you be there on Thursday. She did not reply, but she looked at him that afternoon as if she had read something he had written on his skin.\n\nAna\u00efs Vel sent him a photograph of the empty case shot from a very low angle. In the reflection on the glass, a maintenance panel glowed green, as if it had a mind and it was thinking about disobedience. He printed the photograph and slid it into his jacket and felt sixteen and guilty.\n\nThat night, he stopped by his mother\u2019s place in the old quarter. She poured soup and told him how her friend Reva had gotten into an argument on the Book about whether the ball deserved political asylum. He told her not to say things like that, even as jokes; she told him to stop chiding her like she had forgotten what she knew. They played cards. She asked him twelve tiny questions about his health. He told her eleven small truths. She asked him where his loyalty was, and he said, \u201cOn my feet.\u201d\n\nShe flapped a hand. \u201cAlways complain and then go do something. You and your father both. He did not come back from doing it, you understand, and I would prefer you did.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not a fighter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is the lie small men tell themselves so they can sit down. You stand up and you make that look like a different thing. Drink your soup.\u201d\n\nHe thought about armies, because the word had been in his head like a taste; he thought about the future like a series of rooms he could choose to open. He thought about standing in front of women who were used to being right and asking them to bend. He thought about how that would sound in his mouth. He felt tired and then less tired. He did not sleep well. He got up and bounced a sock ball against the kitchen wall until the neighbor banged on the ceiling. He apologized, out loud, to nobody.\n\nOn Thursday, the heat came early. The Hall\u2019s back door did what old wood did. It was polite to those who knew the trick. He knew the trick now. He slipped inside with Ezra, who carried a toolbox hung with apologies. Lila was a shadow at the street, ignoring the two of them so hard she was the top of a tower in his neck. They went down the corridor that smelled of oil. The maintenance panel glowed green, like in the photograph. The hex fit. It was not theft to open a panel, he told himself, because a door wanted two states. Ezra hummed under his breath to hide the sound of the turning.\n\nThey were inside the small room where the alarms lived and breathed. He could hear the city like a tide. He set up his small, apologetic laptop. He pressed three places inside the maintenance console. He thought of a ball against a wall. Reduce throttle. For three minutes. He looked up at Ezra and myself and the world and he pressed the key you are not supposed to press because if people knew that key were there, they might start leaving.\n\n\u201cLast chance,\u201d Ezra said, meaning: last chance to belong to the names you were given.\n\nTomas smiled, finally. \u201cI intend to belong to more.\u201d\n\nHe felt the Book unclasp like a hand that had been politely killing him. He felt his name shudder and then quiet. He felt the ring ringless: a cold circle with no pulse. He took it off. It came away like a scab. He closed his fist around it. He looked at Ezra and did not cry.\n\n\u201cTime,\u201d Ezra whispered. The alarm\u2019s little lights blinked in an arrangement his father would have appreciated: green green red, green green red. He reached into his jacket for the photograph where the green was greener than truth, and he folded it into a small square and put it in his mouth and chewed. It tasted of ink. He laughed and then coughed and then stood.\n\nOutside, the city lifted its head as if startled by a breeze. Somewhere a woman at a desk pressed a button and frowned. Somewhere a Keeper\u2019s tattoos itched. Somewhere Lila Qadir stopped being at the street and started being at the door, quiet as a blade. Her eyes met his and widened not with surprise but with an accounting. He thought he could see her tallying up his costs.\n\n\u201cGo,\u201d she said without moving her mouth.\n\nHe went. He was nobody on the Book now, a hole where a person had been. He was Tomas Rook, unanchored, which in that city was a kind of insanity. He had his father\u2019s patience in the muscles of his right hand. He had a plan that was not a plan yet. He had a ring that did not know him.\n\nHe stepped out into the bright, hard air, and the city felt suddenly like a field that had always been there under the pavement, waiting for feet. He did not run.\n\nHe would have to move like someone who could be found only if he wished it. He would have to speak like someone who did not need the Book to amplify him. He would have to find those who had spent years training their ears to hear what did not make a sound on the feed. He would have to build, perhaps, a thing with edges and a heart. He would have to teach respect without making himself into the thing he hated, which would be hard because power was shaped like that, like a mouth you slid into and then could barely keep from speaking in the same tone.\n\nHe went to the only place you went when you had done something irreversible: a bench that overlooked a court where children were pretending to be captains choosing teams, where they pointed and laughed and attempted fairness. He sat. He let himself be small in a way that had nothing to do with height. He let the city lean against his shoulder, and he leaned back. He did not check the Book. It did not check him. For the first time in a very long time, his ear heard only the wind go over the mouths of bottles in an alley, and the sound of his own name inside his head like a new ball dropped once to test its bounce. He tapped it with his toe. It came back up to meet him. He smiled that foolish smile the world calls a mistake and sometimes is a beginning.He learned the new edges of the city by stubbing his life on them. The little machines that opened gates with a polite sigh stared through him and refused to recognize the ghost of a man where a credential should be, so he waited near a woman with her arms full of groceries and passed in her slipstream when the door hesitated on kindness. He bought nothing because money had been art on a screen for years, but a fruit vendor with hands like brick gave him a bruised pear for free when he lingered too long, and he ate it at a pace that was both grateful and guilty. He avoided the watchful rectangles over intersections because a certain tilt of glass seemed suddenly predatory, and he learned to walk a step slower and a shade lighter so the ground itself did not argue with his feet.\n\nHe went to Ezra\u2019s locksmith, a man with a name like a cough, one of those old consonant words that sounded like it had been hammered flat and reused as a hinge. The shop was one door below street level and smelled of polish and logic, and the walls were papered with keys that had outlived their locks. The man watched Tomas with a level gaze that began as evaluation and shifted, very slightly, to concern, not for danger but for craft. He laid the ring on the counter like a tooth lost in a fight and explained what he needed, and it felt absurd to say it\u2014an imitation of permission, a circle that would tell the city to stop shouting\u2014but language and metal had always accommodated themselves to each other if you gave them enough patient turns.\n\n\u201cWhat you want is not a key,\u201d the locksmith said. \u201cIt is a lie. Lies are always more expensive than keys because they must tell the truth to a larger number of strangers. What you can have from me is a ring that listens to machines and repeats back the sound they expect without understanding what it means. The price is that it will never love you the way your last ring did. It will never remember you when you slip it off. That might be a virtue.\u201d\n\nTomas laughed, and the laugh made him aware of how long he had gone without letting his throat do that easily. He watched the man select a strip of spring steel and a coil of dull copper and a chip that might once have sat in a doorbell, and he asked the question he should not have, because curiosity had got into him like a second pulse. \u201cYou must have made these before. For others who wanted to go quiet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have made prettier trinkets for mistresses whose lovers wanted their own doors to open,\u201d the locksmith said, dry as dust, and filed the edge of the ring until it looked like nothing worth stealing. \u201cDo not mistake my work for a rebellion. I make things that function. People make revolts. They ruin my hinges when they are in a hurry and then bring me their grief like a padlock threaded through a chain, and I charge them double because grief miskeys everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you ever play?\u201d Tomas asked, and the locksmith\u2019s hand faltered just enough to prove he understood the shorthand of a city.\n\n\u201cMy mother did,\u201d the man said after a beat. \u201cShe sat in the high seats and shouted names until her throat was raw and good. She hated our father for teaching me to catch a ball in the alley where people could see, and she loved him for buying me a glove when she was not watching. That is the usual mathematics of home. Wear this on your left hand. It will echo the heat of your skin and produce numbers enough to pass a glance. The deeper things will not be fooled, but you do not plan to ask them for favors.\u201d\n\n\u201cI plan to avoid them altogether,\u201d Tomas said, and the man grunted approval because avoidance was a form of engineering.\n\nThe imitation ring bit cold against his finger and then warmed dutifully when he breathed on it, a mimicry of affection that did not settle in his bones. He stood a moment in the doorway of the shop, half because he was building up the courage to walk out into a city that could not call his name and half because he liked listening to the locksmith wind his lathe, the sound of something old choosing to continue. The sun made a showroom out of the street; women in bright clothes moved like banners. He put his hands in his pockets so it would not be obvious that the left hand lacked a pulse and the right one shook and was proud of it.\n\nMira Vost wore her white hair like a verdict and used her office like a lever She was at her desk with three screens lit and another dark, and the dark one told her the most because it reflected her face and the patience she had trained into it. A Keeper waited, still as a cutout, until she inclined her head because everyone\u2019s time belonged to her by consent or habit, and she preferred the second. \u201cSomeone went missing inside my building,\u201d she said without preamble, because she did not throw a topic like a song into a room; she put it down on the table, cut into it, and served appropriate portions.\n\n\u201cMissing is not a category,\u201d the Keeper said, and her voice had the coldness of a river rather than ice. \u201cWe have unpaired an account not attached to a criminal ticket, and there was a maintenance window at the Hall concurrent to that unpairing. We have flagged three employees of interest. We do not say missing because we do not lose things.\u201d\n\n\u201cRepeat that inside your head and tell me if it sounds like a line or a truth,\u201d Mira said, not unkindly, because she admired a good lie even when it circulated under her name. \u201cWhich three.\u201d\n\nThe Keeper spoke the names without flinching, and Mira did not blink either because she had trained long ago to decouple surprise from her eyelids. She heard Tomas Rook first and heard other things inside his simple syllables\u2014quiet boy, good ear, fetches a coffee and brings back the temperature of a room with it, does not leak unless someone is dying. She heard Lila Qadir second and heard a bell rung in a bell tower, because if Lila was a suspect it was only by proximity to bad weather, and weather was her profession. She heard Ana\u00efs Vel third and tasted iron because a city should not compel its oldest librarians to learn caution from younger women.\n\n\u201cBring me the facts,\u201d she said, and the Keeper nodded as if facts were a condiment she could produce in any quantity. \u201cLeave the words with tails on them for when the Mayor asks me to flatter her. If a man I have paid to file papers has suddenly obtained the nerve to alter the grammar of our quiet, I want to shake his hand. Then I will decide whether to break it.\u201d\n\nLila stood in the hallway outside with her back to the glass and listened to the weird democracy of shoes passing by. She had felt the flicker when Tomas went out of range, the way the air goes thin on a training climb, and she had stepped toward the gap before she knew whose shape it held. There was a discipline to not moving when your body wanted to, and it derived from older disciplines, the ones born on flood nights and in smoke and in the peculiar silence after you cut a wire and wait to learn whether you have disarmed a trap or a friend. She watched the red indicator over the west stairwell blaze and then go out. She did not change her breathing. She thought, for the first time in weeks, about sleeping in a bed she did not have to fold up in the morning.\n\nIn the Hall, Ana\u00efs Vel met a woman who wore her hair in a braid that managed to be both austere and decorative, a compromise that summarized her posture. The woman asked questions that were polite in their aggressions, and Ana\u00efs answered the impolite ones in her own head because it was a habit that kept her honest. She walked the Keeper past the empty case, past the plaques that told the version of history that won funding, and stopped before a photograph from a long-ago match because it pleased her to be seen looking at something that was not currently bleeding. \u201cDid you know,\u201d she said, as if she was talking to a friend and not a ledger with a voice, \u201cthat the paint on the original stadium railings was a mix of commercial red and a cheaper brown that some man found in a storeroom and decided not to waste, which is why the railings looked like two different memories of the same day? You can see it in this picture if you have eyes. We made a choice and we made a mess and we called it a tradition, which is how all good stories begin.\u201d\n\nThe Keeper nodded in the precise manner of a person who had decided to let a metaphor pass by so she could shoot it later from cover. \u201cWe have footage of you in the gallery at two thirty-two,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have the signature of an alarm you silenced at three oh five. We have your face on six of the cameras, and you stared directly into one of them as if you were trying to seduce it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was thinking of killing it,\u201d Ana\u00efs said cheerfully. \u201cStaring is not seduction when the lens is older than your grandmother and twice as stubborn. I turned off an alarm because it had decided to be offended by a moth. If you would like to arrest the moth, I can find you its name. It will be something Biblical and difficult to spell.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not seem afraid,\u201d the Keeper observed, and Ana\u00efs smiled because it looked good on her and because she was afraid in the complicated way old people were, which meant she was afraid for the wrong things.\n\n\u201cI made a choice years ago not to be afraid of people who think they are history,\u201d she said. \u201cThey keep dying on me. It is very inconvenient. The ball is gone. The case is compromised. Someone with a hex key and an understanding of torque touched it, which means someone with a father touched it, which means I will find him before you do if I choose to ask the right older women. Be efficient, dear. I am trying to set out the folding chairs for an argument.\u201d\n\nTomas took his new ring to the turnstiles and learned that the city would accept a forged handshake if he did not ask for more than he deserved. He passed through doorways and was not stopped. He stood near the small screens that wanted to tell him what to buy and they decided he was uninteresting and turned their pretty faces toward someone else. He found the seam between what was enforced and what was believed, and it was wider than he had thought, a small blessing disguised as indifference. He bought a train token from a man who even the Book ignored, because the token machines wanted prettier fingers than his and because humility and copper had a friendship that had survived worse regimes than this.\n\nOn the train he sat in a corner where the light made everyone look like a painting of a better version of themselves and watched a little girl with a braid that refused its mother\u2019s elastic. The girl was using two fingers to drum a rhythm on her own knee, a rhythm he knew without knowing he knew it until his foot answered, a pattern lifted from the old league chants, stripped of syllables and left as a heartbeat that led nowhere. Her mother noticed, not the rhythm but the man, and her eyes slid away and then back, and she saw the lack of a pulse in his ring and the shape of a careful man sitting small in a large world. She moved between him and her daughter and did not scowl. She put the girl\u2019s hand on her own knee and let her drum there, the sound a permission that did not invest itself.\n\nEzra met him at the gym door and smacked his shoulder with affection that pretended to be critique. \u201cYou walked across the city with that face,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look like a primary school teacher who has discovered his class has been swapped for wolves and is trying to decide whether to pet them or join them. Come down. We have figured out the metal of the back panel. It likes to complain in a very particular pitch when it is touched with a key five sizes too small for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are laughing,\u201d Tomas said, and dropped into the stairs that smelled of sweat and sawdust and the past tense of verbs that the Book had deprecated.\n\n\u201cWe are laughing all the time,\u201d Ezra said. \u201cWe are laughing because we are still allowed to be in the same room, and because when the ball leaves the floor here it makes a sound that is enough like the one from our mothers\u2019 stories that our bodies relax without asking permission. Stop looking like your presence is a crack. Stand with us. That is an order you can disobey later.\u201d\n\nThey stood, and that counted, because a courtyard and a basement and a bad hallway had become the only places respect could be built with eye contact and noise. Tomas watched a kid with a scar on his lip pivot around an invisible defender and toss a sock-ball through a square of light sharp enough to shave with. He watched a woman with a busted knee grin like a dare and then treat herself gently, which was harder than daring for some. He played a little, badly. He remembered his father\u2019s hands shadowing his and felt that particular ache that had become less a pain and more a tuning fork, a way to find middle C inside a day full of chatter.\n\n\u201cTell me a thing,\u201d Ezra said when they were breathless enough to be honest. \u201cNot a plan. A thing you want. Something you can say out loud that is not a commandment.\n\n\u201cI want to look at the ball,\u201d Tomas said before prudence could tighten his jaw. \u201cNot the picture on the feed or the official portrait that makes it look like an egg in an expensive cradle. The ball. The actual brown skin of it. The scuff where she said she kicked it in practice and missed on purpose to make someone laugh. The crack they denied and the signatures they smoothed over like varnish. I want to see it to know whether wanting it was the first lie I told myself.\u201d\n\nEzra leaned his head against the wall and closed his eyes as if someone had smoothed a cool cloth across his forehead. \u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to throw it once with my eyes closed and hear it come back so I know everything is still symmetrical. You are an idiot to say that out loud in a building with microphones, and I am an idiot to agree. We are properly matched.\u201d\n\nHe went to see his mother because she had asked him to come on Thursdays and bring the bread she liked from the stall where they overcharged him less than they overcharged other men. Her apartment had a plant she had somehow bullied into living and a rug his father had bought in a decade when rugs were the only thing a person could own that no one would take unless they intended to stay. She looked at him with a hunger he had not let her indulge since he was fifteen and decided honesty at home would kill him faster than silence.\n\n\u201cYou went quiet,\u201d she said, and he did not waste either of their supplies by denying it.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is quieter in the quiet than they told us it would be. I thought I would be lonely enough to eat my own knuckles, but mostly there is room for other noises. I had not heard how often my knees crack when I go up stairs. I had not heard the woman in the next building practicing her violin three floors below the note that would make the hair on my arms stand up. I had not heard my own laugh like a stranger\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will get yourself hurt,\u201d she said, and then shrugged because the sentence was the least interesting she could have chosen. \u201cSomeone will knock at my door and use that tone that turns mothers into paperwork. I will say I do not know anything and they will think I am lying and I will not be. You will bring me soup on Sundays and that will be the burden I bear, that I do not get to hug my child in the marketplace for fear someone will think arms are conspiracies.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can stop,\u201d he said, and her cheeks wrinkled into a shape that looked very much like the expression she wore when his father told her a joke she did not want to laugh at because it would reward him for being late.\n\n\u201cYou can,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can also stop seeing well because it is inconvenient to notice a hole in the ground before you step into it. I have taught children long enough to know which of my students will jump the fence to take a shortcut and which will stand in front of it and spend fifteen minutes arguing with a plank. You are a fence-jumper in your bones and a plank-arguer in your job. I let your father do one thing that he needed to do and he did not come back from doing it. You will bring me bread on Thursdays. That is my non-negotiable. If you go away and come back with your skin rearranged, do not expect me to admire the new lines. I am not obliged to enjoy your heroics.\u201d\n\nHe promised, because promising is a form of faith and she needed him to have some that could be cashed in later. He left with the bread still warm in its paper and with the sensation that he had put his hand into a pocket and discovered it had a hole in the bottom he had not noticed. He turned toward the river because rivers make sense even when everything else is making a kind of sense that depends on bullet points. He walked past the stadium where women ran in loops under lights that had been coaxed into being beautiful, and he knew he would have to go inside soon under some pretense if he was going to do the thing he was pretending he had not decided to do.\n\nMira called Lila into her office late, the hour when the building\u2019s mirrors are kinder and the air tastes like the unspoken. She poured a measure of bitter liquor into a glass and did not offer any, which was friendlier than sharing, because the hour could be mistaken for intimacy if you were not careful. \u201cTell me what you know that is not on the feeds,\u201d she said, and watched Lila\u2019s eyebrows because they read more honestly than most lips.\n\n\u201cI know the Hall\u2019s back door sticks and can be persuaded not to by someone who knows where to put the heel of their hand,\u201d Lila said. \u201cI know I stood at the corner on Thursday and watched two men carrying a toolbox that made no sound, which is not how tools behave when they are honest. I know that a maintenance panel blinked at me as if it were winking, and I know a wink is a vulgar gesture when it comes from a device that turns tragedy on and off. You know the same, Chancellor. I know you want me to say a name so we can start the machinery that makes people feel better for thirty hours before they begin to suspect they have been given a story instead of relief.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou refuse to say a name in this room,\u201d Mira said, as if she were checking a line item off a list, and Lila nodded because refusal is a form of professionalism if you do it symmetrically.\n\n\u201cI am counting the number of things I have forgiven you for,\u201d Lila said, and softened the pronoun with a small smile like a footnote. \u201cIt helps keep me honest. I will add one if this conversation goes well and subtract two if you tell me you already picked the person you wanted me to betray before I came in.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not rehearse your revolution,\u201d Mira said gently. \u201cIt makes your hair look good but it bores me. Bring me what you find. Bring me people by the ear if they are foolish. Bring me the person who stole the ball when you find them, and if it is me, bring me anyway. I have been arrested before and it made my back stronger.\u201d\n\nLila stood and did not salute because salutes in this building were an amateur\u2019s mistake. \u201cIf the person who took the ball wanted to put it back,\u201d she said, \u201cwould you release your jaw around their throat or take a breath and help. The second is a question.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the second there is no answer I can give that will make both of us like ourselves,\u201d Mira said, and managed a smile not because she felt like it but because it was a trick she had learned young. \u201cAsk me again when the ball has dirt on it and we can smell the grass.\u201d\n\nAna\u00efs sent Tomas a message via a method that made him smile because it was old and clever. She had written a note on paper with pencil and given it to a child in pigtails to carry to the man with the scar who managed Ezra\u2019s door, and it said in its small, stern handwriting: Come at closing. Walk like a person with a headache. Do not bring anything sharp. If you are followed, buy two oranges and put one in each coat pocket. That way you will know whether you are using your hands out of nerves. Also, oranges are good for you and they keep secrets with dignity.\n\nHe went at closing and walked as if the light was too bright for him and as if his head could be persuaded by posture to ache less. The guard at the Hall looked like a person who had practiced arguing and then retired into a job where people made her less angry, and she nodded to him with the sort of courtesy you save for neighbors you do not like but would defend in a fire. Ana\u00efs met him in the gallery where the busts watched the doors as if their line of sight had been engineered for suspicion, and she led him again toward the office with the dust and the plant and the stool. On the way he stopped to look at a photograph of a goal he had seen a hundred times and never noticed the woman in the background who had her hands over her mouth as if she had dropped a secret.\n\n\u201cIt is very inconvenient when the world has faces,\u201d Ana\u00efs said. \u201cCome. Do not look at me as if I am about to tell you either a bedtime story or a murder ballad. Both are true and I am tired of polarity. The ball is not here. It has not left the city. It is in a place where it is technically still inside a boundary that satisfies the anxious, and that is the kind of lie people like because it lets their spines relax without proving them wrong outright.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hid it,\u201d he said, and felt the embarrassment of being both grateful and scolded.\n\n\u201cI moved it,\u201d she said. \u201cHiding suggests shame, while moving is a curator\u2019s privilege and implies a plan. Look at this.\u201d She unrolled a photograph that had been taken just after something joyful had happened and now had the atmosphere of a crime scene, which is how archives can make saints or felons out of people depending on which side of the glass you wake up. \u201cThere,\u201d she said, tapping the margin where an absurd detail hid, the way truth prefers to do. \u201cThe bronze ball over the Hall\u2019s entrance is not a casting. It is not hollow. It is two shells cradling a third. Someone decided they needed a matryoshka and then forgot to properly enumerate their dolls. The smallest shell is the measure of the real ball. It is not the real ball, but it is close enough to fool anyone who is looking without touching. If someone had a father who taught them the hour and the patience, they could make a swap that satisfied every eye but their own. If someone wanted to create a hole in a net and needed an honest reason for the net to make room, they might borrow an absence from a myth.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wanted the three minutes,\u201d he said, and she took off her glasses to rub the bridge of her nose, because old people were tired all the time with good reason.\n\n\u201cI wanted to see whether a person like you would find them,\u201d she said. \u201cDo not be vain. I had five names. Three of them are men. You were the least likely to tell me to go to hell when I asked for a favor. That is my method: respect, bribery, and accuracy. We will put it back. I do not intend to feed the city to the wolves for a metaphor. Between the taking and the returning, I would like to see whether I can alter the angle by which people remember that object. There is a crack. I am not senile. Let it show in one photograph. Let it live as something that had to survive and did and got its scars honestly. If your Chancellor wants to pin a new slogan to the idea, let her do it with her own fingers and see whether the pin draws blood.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are asking me to become a thief for a truth,\u201d he said, and the word thief did not sit well in his mouth because he had always been the sort of boy who brought the chalk back to the ledge after drawing where he shouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI am telling you that respect is sometimes taken without a receipt,\u201d she said. \u201cTake it and sign your name later if you survive the taking. If someone is going to hunt you in the meantime, you will need a woman who opens doors with her shoulder instead of her keys. Do you have one?\u201d\n\nHe thought of Lila and the way she had said, Go, without breaking the line of her mouth into an expression that could be used against her in some future hearing. He nodded because naming her would be an injury and because Ana\u00efs did not need the name to understand the shape of the help. Ana\u00efs touched his forearm like touching wood before a storm. \u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cDo not make her explain why she chose to do it. Give her something cleaner to say when someone points a mirror at her. Do not be poetic in front of someone with a badge.\u201d\n\nThe morning the Book noticed him properly was not the morning he left but the day after, when the numbers that meant: Tomas read this, Tomas witnessed that, Tomas approved the phrasing of a condolence\u2014stayed zero long enough to be embarrassing at a meeting. The Book did not do embarrassment, but the people with their eyes on it did, and they pretended it was a button you could push to produce compliance. Messages arrived for his old name like wisps of smoke finding an open window and being surprised the room they expected was a field. The imitation ring on his finger hummed twice, an attempt to synchronize, and then gave up with an indifference that made him feel both proud and stupid.\n\nMira convened a panel with a smile that promised biscuits and put in front of them a map of the city with a hole in it exactly the size of a man who carried pencils and wore soft shoes to work. \u201cYou will say it is nothing,\u201d she said, and they did, and then they said it was probably a death, and she said no because deaths were laborious in a city that insisted on certainty, and then someone suggested a vacation, and she said she did not hire men who took vacations because the work made them too nervous to enjoy beaches. \u201cIt is an unpairing without a ticket,\u201d she said finally, her voice like a clear bell in a room that had been muffled on purpose. \u201cThose are supposed to occur only for maintenance or death. This one occurred concurrent to a theft and in the presence of people who are not known for stealing. I want the person in charge of vocabulary to tell me what we call this.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn accident,\u201d said the Mayor\u2019s liaison, because nothing comforts a person more than the idea that no one intended harm. \u201cA placeholder. A glitch.\u201d\n\n\u201cGlitches are for lights in hallways and teeth that bite their own tongues,\u201d Mira said. \u201cWe will get him back if he wants to be gotten. If he does not, we will make a statement this afternoon reminding everyone that the city loves their choices. In the meantime, stop turning knobs at the Hall as if you could make guilt come out of a pipe. It makes the cameras twitch, and twitching makes people look at cameras, and the last thing I want is to teach people to see.\u201d\n\nLila stood in the corridor after and felt the weight of being a stone in moving water, the way force complicates itself around you. Her supervisor, a woman who had the face of a saint and the habit of a butcher, touched her arm with two fingers and left the imprint of a future reprimand as if oil could stain through a sleeve. \u201cWe have a warrant for a name,\u201d the supervisor said. \u201cWe will go to his mother\u2019s house and stand outside in a way that makes the neighbors watch. If he is there, he will rush. If he is not, she will tell us that he is not, and we will pretend to believe her, because we prefer the look of ourselves when we are magnanimous. You like this boy. I can smell it. Put that smell somewhere else until Friday.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like that he knows where to stand when a bus starts to slide,\u201d Lila said, a careful sentence that contained three truths and no admission. \u201cI like that he listens when older women talk like water under a boat. I do not like this job when it makes me catalog what I like about people who do not fit in rooms I wrote the plans for. I will do the thing you are asking. I will not look like a person who enjoys it.\u201d\n\nThey knocked at his mother\u2019s door with flat knuckles because the city had taught them not to pound unless they had a camera pointing the other way. His mother answered wearing a cardigan that had survived three fashions and a look that would have sent nuns to their rosaries. She let them in and offered tea because hospitable refusal was her favorite sport, and she stood in the doorway of her own kitchen until Lila produced a polite, official need to be inside of it. \u201cHe went out with bread,\u201d his mother said, and Lila loved her a little for the sentence\u2019s ambiguity. \u201cHe will bring me soup on Sunday. We will play cards and he will cheat once so I do not feel I have gotten old and dull. Do not look at my photographs and pretend any of the faces will help you. The Book did not stop by here to bless them. We do the blessing ourselves on Fridays.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour son is unpaired,\u201d the supervisor said, as if that were an accusation, and his mother made a small sound, almost a laugh, because the word was rude if you saw it with its clothes off.\n\n\u201cMy son is in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cThat has always been his problem. He will have to decide how much of it to embrace and how much to argue with. I do not think he will choose the right balance. He never did. He might make me proud in a year if you give him enough rope to ruin a fence with.\u201d\n\nTomas stood outside three doors down and listened through a lattice, because the old buildings had retained their talents for telling you about the people inside them, and he learned something about his mother again that made his chest rearrange itself for a minute. Lila did not turn her head, but she let her gaze go sideways and catch the line of the lattice, and he felt the very slight permission that lived in the set of her shoulders. He went away not hurriedly, because haste wakes up dogs, and turned his mind toward the bigger theft that now had a deadline the shape of a press conference.\n\nHe met Ana\u00efs at the base of a ladder no one had touched in twenty years because the caretakers had been told that certain acts were now beneath them and they believed it. Ezra leaned against a column that knew its own weight, and he held a bag with a coil of rope in it as if he were taking a serpent for a walk. The bronze ball over the entrance was backlit against a sky that had the audacity to be lovely during a scandal, and a few girls in team jackets stood across the street taking pictures of themselves with angles curated to place the empty in the frame like a charm against an exam. The plan was not glamorous, which is how plans want to be if they intend to work twice.\n\nHe climbed. The ladder talked to him in the language of rust and complaint. He felt the uncanny steadiness that comes over a body when it decides it will not die and therefore might as well behave. He reached the seam Ana\u00efs had described and found that it was exactly where it had been in the photograph because secrets are not clever enough to move on their own. The hex fit like a memory. He turned with the patience of his father humming in his wrist, slow, slow, slow, because hurrying has a tone and bolts hate it. The outer shell came away like a hat being removed before an anthem. The second shell had been painted to look like reverence and was simply a shield. The inner, smaller form was the measure, and it was exquisite and wrong.\n\nHe held it and imagined for a minute the room where someone had decided to make this so their conscience could be clean for an hour. He lowered it with the rope and the breath he had been saving since he cut the Book\u2019s cord, and Ezra caught it with the reverence of a boy catching a thing he\u2019s been promised will change his height. Ana\u00efs had cotton prepared to keep the vulgarities of the ground from touching it. Tomas took the synthetic sphere they had brought\u2014a charity ball, too smooth, too eager\u2014and fitted it where the measure had been. He reassembled the shells, and the bronze face over the door looked down on the street with the same expression as before, because art knows how to wear lies like lipstick.\n\nWhen he came down, Lila was there with her hands in her pockets, pretending to be a stranger who might be in the mood to observe a museum doing museum things. He put his palms against the stone to show her that he had not pocketed anything obvious, and she smiled, small and private, because she had never believed in innocence as a strategy. \u201cYou are on a ladder in a city that thinks vertigo is a philosophy,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you fall, I will report that you did it on purpose and use your death in a presentation to frighten interns.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I live,\u201d he said, \u201cwill you use my life to do anything but frighten interns.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, and he tried not to let the heat of that syllable make him clumsy. \u201cI will use it to make someone above my pay grade stop talking.\u201d\n\nThey went inside together for the first time since he had gone quiet, and the Hall welcomed them like a building that had decided to forgive. Ana\u00efs nodded once, briskly, because open sentiment slowed hands, and she took them through a service corridor that had learned to be humble. In the room with the dust and the plant and the stool, she set the measure on the table and then, without flourish, pulled aside a cabinet that hid a safe people had assumed was decorative because it had been sitting under a map for so long. She opened it with a key she gave a name aloud, because doors like to be addressed before they yield. Inside, wrapped in linen and arrogance, sat the ball.\n\nHe thought he had prepared himself. He had rehearsed both disdain and tears. He had decided to feel nothing but the shape of it against his palm, because abstract feelings seemed disrespectful. What he felt instead was the pleasant bewilderment of a hand holding something round and the shock of the human scale of a myth. It was not larger than his memory had made it. It was not smaller, either. It was simply a ball, with the lines of its construction visible, the leather worn to a softness his fingers recognized from the sleeve of his father\u2019s jacket in winter. The crack was there, exactly where Ana\u00efs had promised it would be, a hairline imperfection that ruined the story and made it better if you had a stomach for the truth.\n\n\u201cRight there,\u201d Ana\u00efs said, and her voice shook for the first time that day and probably the last. \u201cShe kicked it during a practice in a week when she thought quitting might be the real victory and the ball hit the post and came back and hit her in the mouth, and she laughed so hard she sat down. She told me that story in this room and swore me to secrecy because the story works better without the laugh. I am too old for stories that work.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do we do with that knowledge,\u201d Lila asked, and the practical shape of her voice steadied the room.\n\n\u201cWe put it back with its crack facing camera,\u201d Ana\u00efs said. \u201cWe let the myth adjust. You do not correct an ocean, you let the tide look like its own idea. Tomas, you are going to carry it to the case, and your hands will be on it, and no one will be able to make a clean sin out of that, because they will want the picture of the ball more than they want the picture of you. Lila, you will stand where people can see your profile and decide not to lie to themselves about why you let him pass. Ezra, you will go home and hide that expression you are wearing so your wife does not accuse you of being in love with a circle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d Ezra said, and for once he did not make it a joke, because worship was a poor habit for men and a fine one for citizens.\n\nThey walked the way a procession would if it had been invented by clerks and soldiers and old women and one man who was trying to learn humility. The corridor was short enough not to ask courage and long enough to make you consider your posture. Lila went ahead and the guards saw her and pretended to enjoy her authority. The Book would not catch this because Ana\u00efs had turned down the volume of its seeing for three minutes on account of a scheduled dusting. The case yawned politely because the hex had been talked into cooperation. He set the ball down, and his hand lingered an instant too long, and he said goodbye not to an object but to the idea that he had not made choices yet, because after this every choice would be compared to this one and measured for its balance.\n\nAfter, people in the lobby clapped because they did not know whether to whistle. Someone sang a line from the Book that was not actually in the Book and got away with it. ana\u00efs stood as if she were vibrating slightly, like a string under the finger of someone who knew the exact pressure to produce clarity. Lila leaned on a pillar and raised one eyebrow at him as if to say: Put your hands in your pockets now, because men who have just done something in public and leave their hands visible look either weak or predatory, and I would prefer you looked like a person who had bought oranges and walked home.\n\nHe obeyed. He bought oranges because it was now a talisman as well as a snack, and he put one in each coat pocket and felt the weight like something honest among all the practiced fictions. He walked back into the city he had made worse for some people and better for none yet, which was not as consoling as he had hoped it would be. The imitation ring was light on his finger and did not care about any of this. The Book might know his face again if it wanted to, because cameras learn fast when they are told to. He had put his hand on the ball and now he had to live with the way that had arranged his future.\n\nIn her office, Mira watched the clip the Hall\u2019s feed had produced and had to admire it, which was irritating. The crack was evident if you knew where to look, and the line the official account had posted about history being a house and lighting rooms had been repurposed as if they had been waiting for it. The comments were elegant in their performative grief and then grew toothy in their relief, because relief comes with a right to scold. She paused the clip on a frame where Lila\u2019s jaw was a geometry problem and Tomas\u2019s hand was still a shadow near the ball, and she felt the ache in her face that meant she was going to have to acquiesce to a narrative she had not authored. She turned off the screen and took the little gold clock pin off her lapel and rolled its face between her fingers until the minute hand bent half a degree, a sacrilege only she would notice.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d she said to the empty office, because saying fine to a room is a way to put arrogance down somewhere it cannot grow. \u201cWe will let this travel. We will speak about cracks and scars and the beauty of refusal. We will reference men without naming them and women without apologizing. We will talk about respect as if it were water. We will hunt you later when the light is worse and the applause has stopped.\u201d\n\nTomas went back to the bench where children chose captains and tried to pretend choosing mattered in this small case more than what they did after. A boy pointed at him and then at another boy and then at the floor, and he smiled and shook his head as if he had been offered candy he had already decided to refuse. A woman sat on the other end of the bench and put her bag down like an accusation and then pulled out a sandwich and broke it and handed half to him without looking. \u201cYou are brave,\u201d she said as if they had been discussing the weather, and he shook his head because calling him brave would endanger him faster than any warrant.\n\n\u201cI am someone with oranges in his pockets,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a different class of citizen.\u201d\n\nShe laughed and he let himself enjoy the way sound can be a hand on your shoulder when you aren\u2019t looking. He ate half the sandwich and thought about the things he had set in motion and the pieces he hadn\u2019t found names for yet. He thought about his sister\u2019s voice on the telephone saying, Don\u2019t get fired for saying the wrong true thing, and the way wrong and true had braided themselves like those plastic bracelets children made and then lost in gutters. He thought of Lila, who had already spent her quota of bravery for the month and would doubtless be asked for more, and of Ana\u00efs, who had put a hand on his and made him feel the dignity of small disobediences. He thought of Mira, whom he had never pretended to understand because she did not pretend to be understandable.\n\nHe had a hole in the Book that had his shape and would probably be paved over in the morning with something smooth and plausible. He had a ring that lied kindly and would betray him if he asked it for love. He had men and women in basements and on ladders and at desks who had decided to take small pieces of their own fear and build something with it that was not a barricade. He had a mother who asked for bread and soup and his face in her doorway on Sundays. He had a city that might not forgive him but might learn to speak about forgiveness in a new tense. He had oranges, which were sweet and exacting, and he had the necessary arrogance of a person who had decided to stop being an audience for a while and learn how to do something frightening on a stage he did not own.The day after the return, the crack learned to do tricks that would have made anyone blush if it had been a person. On screens it tilted just enough to catch light like a healed seam; in print it sat upright as if it had always been part of the design; in conversations it widened and shrank according to who was using it as a mirror for their own beliefs. The city discovered relief and criticism could coexist for a morning without biting each other, which felt to everyone like progress until it didn\u2019t. Tomas watched it all sideways through other people\u2019s mouths and the occasional generous newspaper left on a bench, and he noticed how quickly an image becomes a proverb if you splash it on enough clean surfaces. He carried oranges because he liked the weight and because strangers noticed the fruit and sometimes smiled, and he found that the small economy of shared glances could replace, for an hour or two at a time, the more violent economy of the feed.\n\nMira Vost stopped pretending the hole did not interest her. She called her counsel and then sent them away when they began to sound like a choir warming up on a hymn she did not care to sing, and she wrote on a yellow pad because paper did not yet ask for passwords. In the meeting with the Mayor she admired the exactness of the woman\u2019s tears again and allowed herself the private pettiness of wishing for once to cry over a thing and not over the work required to leverage it. \u201cWe will hold an evening,\u201d she said, and the word deliberately refused to be vigil or rally or forum, because words with teeth collect enemies faster than they collect affection. She asked for candles and told the procurement officer to call them lights. She told the Keepers to widen their net without dragging the bottom, and she forbade arrests inside the Hall because she did not intend to train the public to associate awe with handcuffs if she could help it. There were lines even she did not cross, not because she was tender but because she understood the maintenance schedule of a city\u2019s soul.\n\nLila slept in a room that could have belonged to a monk if monks liked neat boots and had to keep their hair ties in a cup so they would not look like talismans. She lay on her back and counted a set of muscles down her body to distract herself from asking whether Tomas would be foolish next at noon or at dusk, and she stopped on the small stubborn knot in her calf that had never fully forgiven the flood for teaching her which way to run. The unit\u2019s chatter snuck through the vents because nothing in the building stayed where you put it if it could travel by echo, and she listened to a young officer practice the voice he intended to use on someone\u2019s mother. She stood and wrote herself a note on her palm with a blunt pencil: doors, shoulders, oranges, because three of those words contained everything you could teach someone who did not want the Book to be their entire diet. After breakfast she pressed the paper-thin coin into a payphone and listened to the comfort of static because nothing in that connection wanted to optimize her. She told a woman who ran a laundry in the south quarter to leave an orange in the third dryer this afternoon and to tell a boy named Demitri to look for it, and when the woman asked why, she said because I am teaching myself to like redundancies again.\n\nAna\u00efs Vel wrote a label card that did not need to get through committee because she had moved the committee meeting by an hour and then forgotten to tell anyone but the janitor. The card said, very simply, that objects that endure will show you where they have. She wanted to add a sentence about humility traveling in the company of wear and being, consequently, very bad at publicity, but something in her old curator\u2019s body told her that a single clause, plain as broth, would work better under glass than any speech. She chose hours and called them open not because she liked the word but because it refuted the old rumor that only those with uniforms and escorts were allowed to stand very close to certain things. When a junior kept reminding her that crowd control would be an issue, she said, the crowd has had control of itself before and will be flattered if you let it try. She put Tomas on the roster as a floor attendant under a name that had been used once for a carpenter who had repaired a stair and been paid with free entrance for life, and she smiled because sixty years later the covenant was still holding.\n\nHe found a printer in a basement that smelled of burnt sugar and defeat, a man who had inherited a letterpress and a father\u2019s bad jokes about fonts. The machine coughed and then took a breath, and with a little coaxing it agreed to lay down ink where Tomas pointed and to be patient when he changed his mind halfway through a line. He wrote a sheet he refused to call a manifesto because the word made his tongue lie to him, and he gave it a title that could be said out loud without moving the lips too much: Respect in Practice. The first rule was not a rule at all but a picture of a court with thirteen numbered dots and a dotted line showing how a ball could move through hands and space and come back to a person without making them more important than the others, and the second was a sentence that insisted people were allowed to be small and still be loud. The locksmith came down at lunch and read half the sheet and shook his head, not in disapproval but because he recognized the arrogant kindness of a man trying to teach the city to hum in a key it had forgotten. They printed five hundred because five hundred can be carried in a duffel without noticing and because a larger number would have made them feel like economists.\n\nHis sister called and swallowed his hello with a sigh that had a train schedule in it because her days were measured by bells and the lengths of stories children will consent to before you are obliged to laugh. She said someone had spoken to her headmistress in a voice that was all teeth and compliments, and the headmistress had told her to keep her family dramas off the premises unless they came with a curriculum. He told her he was writing a curriculum for standing on stairs and letting other people have the good angle for once, and she said he had always been infuriating when he tried not to be witty. She asked him if he had oranges in his pockets right now because she had become superstitious without intending to, and he told her he had, and then she told him that he would come Sunday whether or not there were officers sitting on the stoop playing at being potted plants, because soup was soup and their mother was stricter than the state.\n\nThey intended to catch him at Open Hours because it provided the symmetry administrators prize, and because the Hall\u2019s air was good enough to make a photograph of his arrest look less cruel. Mira had told them not to, and her orders had a longer shelf life than most, but orders travel badly when a junior has a chance to be the person whose name is said on a radio. Lila heard a shape of the plan through a corridor that liked to flirt with her and took the stairs two at a time because the elevator would have announced her intentions to the building\u2019s main nervous system. She found the man with the habit of asking for forgiveness and not permission and told him to forgive himself in advance for a thing he was not going to do, and when he blinked at her, she smiled like a knife behind a curtain and told him if he wanted to live long enough to enjoy bureaucratic vindication he would wait for her to stamp something. After he walked away she leaned on the wall hard enough to leave a memory in it, and then she called Ezra and said, in the tone that turned men into colleagues and colleagues into conspirators for exactly five minutes, that she needed a decoy with a mimic ring and a bad haircut to walk in at four twenty and out at four thirty-two, and she needed him to look bored in both directions.\n\nThe first of the hours were busy with people who had taken the day off the way you take off a sweater when someone says there will be wine on a terrace and then you arrive and it is a lecture. There were girls with hair plaited intricately because they had learned to put order where they could, and there were boys with their hands in their pockets trying to decide whether touching the glass would make them more or less suspect as citizens. The case listened and did not judge because its very existence was a human misinterpretation of humility, and the ball sat like a bird that had agreed to be near because you were quiet and not because it was tame. Tomas stood near a plaque and showed a little boy how to tilt his head to see the scuff that meant a day had been worse and then better, and he showed the boy\u2019s mother where her son\u2019s eyes were doing a dance between pride and confusion and told her that, yes, the crack was meant to be there now; no, it was not meant to be, and yes, both could be true. Someone tried to start a chant because they felt they were supposed to, and it stuttered and then dissolved into a murmur that felt better once it had found its level.\n\nMira watched from a floor that had been built to make overseers feel contemplative about the masses and therefore more righteous about having their own bathroom. She liked the way the crack refused to be allegory unless given consent, and she disliked how quickly the consent was being manufactured in the lobby by clever men with folded pamphlets in their hands. She saw Lila in profile and recognized the discipline of not looking at the person who mattered and the skill of appearing to be the one who could answer if a person insisted on making her day worse. When she had watched long enough to satisfy the part of her that enjoyed testing the polish on the city and finding where it had not taken, she went downstairs and stood, smaller than she preferred to be, beside Tomas and said without ornament that he was causing work. He told her he had been hired to cause work and she almost laughed because she preferred impertinence when it was dressed properly and did not come with slogans. She asked him whether he intended to continue being an audience member with excellent taste or whether he meant to write a program, and he said he was trying to teach people how to clap without waiting for a cue. They stood a long minute together, two people who distrusted the romance of eye contact, and she said, in a voice in which she did her most generous lying, that if he paired again, temporarily, she could make a part of this official enough that he would not have to practice his sneaking so often. He told her he would pair if the Book learned to whisper he rather than it when speaking about citizens, and she said he was asking for a hug and a dictionary from a machine that had been fed on recipes for obedience, and he said that meant he was asking the right person.\n\nThe Keepers moved with the confidence of people who believed that angles loved them and cameras would always choose their good side, and for a minute the lobby considered a role reversal and decided against it because the children were watching and people had worn their good coats to see a thing that was not a scuffle. Lila found the one with his jaw already squared for regret and leaned into his gravity and said there were three of him in the room even if he did not see the other two, and if he wanted to go home later without discovering a bruise shaped like a country he had never visited, he would move left now and then right later and he would think of his mother on a bench somewhere knitting a scarf for a winter that would not come. He moved because good soldiers recognize orders when they do not arrive in the proper packaging, and because his shoes had always regretted friction. Ezra\u2019s decoy yawned on schedule, and three men with high collars yawned back involuntarily, and in that small involuntary exchange a plan deflated enough to no longer be dangerous.\n\nAt six when the light makes every story prettier than the truth by half a step, Ana\u00efs took a breath she had been saving since the first rumor and told a group of women who had never met that yes, the ball had been moved, and no, the city was not going to ignite because people stood very close to something old and remembered their own bodies. She said, and she allowed herself the indulgence of the word because she had earned it, that care was not piety, and that respect was not obedience, and that a crack in a ball and in a story could serve as measuring tools rather than as excuses. Tomas lifted a child to see and felt for a moment the ghost of the guard\u2019s old chiding and felt then also his father\u2019s hands, not lifting the child but teaching him the posture of lifting, which is different. He caught a woman\u2019s eye across the case and knew because of the way she smiled that for the rest of her week she would be slightly kinder to her own lungs.\n\nOutside, a woman with a megaphone tried a phrase that would have got a person arrested last year and received instead a glare that said people were busy with something that required more tenderness than yelling. Two boys kicked a sock-ball very gently between their shoes as if teaching themselves the anatomy of compliments, and a Keepers\u2019 van purred like a cat waiting to be told it had been good. Lila stood with her hands in her pockets and reminded herself that pockets are for weapons and secrets and one of those is illegal and the other is not, and then reminded herself that the legality of secrets had been changed overnight before by women with smiles like lids on boiling pots. She saw Tomas begin to step toward the wrong door, and she lifted her chin a fraction to remind him that this building had three exits and the one he was choosing would deliver him into hands that had washed themselves recently in anticipation.\n\nHe ducked left into the corridor that smelled of lemon because no one had learned yet that lemon made people think of childhood, and he passed the service room where he had briefly become an unperson and felt the temptation to go in and do it again just to see if it felt different now that he had admitted to himself that he liked breathing without accompaniment. He put an orange on the base of the case because it pleased him to put something bright and mortal near something old and adored, and because he liked the notion that the cameras would not know where to file the gesture and perhaps the City would enjoy, for once, a moment for which there was no approved caption. On the street a man with a hat asked him for a sheet of his pamphlet and offered a stamp in return, and Tomas took the stamp because stamps make you feel like there are still systems that can be gamed elegantly without spilling blood. He walked to the square where the pigeons have no respect and the children throw corn and the old men argue about line calls in matches they did not attend, and he listened to the air settle now that the day had gotten its way with them.\n\nAt home, his mother put the soup on the table and told him his aunt had commented on the crack as if it were a scratch on a new car, and he said his aunt had earned the right to be precise and ungenerous in her metaphors. They played cards and she cheated before he got the chance, which she did to signal that she had not completed her transformation into a saint and would prefer if he did not force it upon her with his earnestness. She asked what he planned to call the thing he was building and he said he did not intend to name it at all because names behave like ropes and he needed something more like water, and she rolled her eyes and told him if he started talking like a priest she would make him scrub the baseboards until he remembered where the broom lived.\n\nBy midnight the Mayor\u2019s people were trial-ballooning an ordinance that would please the frightened and irritate the self-possessed, a policy with a long aspirational title that could be shortened to something as crude as a bruise if someone wanted to chant against it. They called it an act and packed into it smaller acts, and one of them would give the Book the authority to suggest and then insist on certain routes through the city for citizens whose rings read as agitated. Mira read the draft and wrote in the margin, quietly, that agitated was a category best left to water and children, and she balanced her pin on the edge of her desk as if she might allow it to fall and then did not. She imagined a future in which she permitted Tomas his project and admired its ferocity from a distance while clipping it when it brushed against power, and she imagined a different future where she cut it now and bore the headlines later, and she did the math with a calm that made her junior staff nervous because they preferred their cruelty to come with motion.\n\nThe next morning Tomas stood at the edge of a court that had not been painted in two summers and told whoever walked by that this was not a meeting, because meetings have chairs and minutes and these were feet and seconds. He said it again and again until it became part of the air and did not require his mouth, and people arrived with oranges because news travels fastest when it arrives as a joke. They put the oranges at the corners, not because it meant anything mystical but because it translated a circle into a square you could see from a window. He held up the sheet with the dotted lines and explained the drill and asked for someone who knew how to bark at timing without making enemies, and a woman with a voice that had frightened her into a good job volunteered to be heard. They ran the pattern until people felt both smarter and more foolish than they had an hour before, and when a man threw too hard and apologized without prompting, Tomas felt something like the Book\u2019s pulse in his old index finger and told himself it was simply blood remembering it had circuits of its own.\n\nThey did it again at dusk under a bridge because bridges are where you go to keep faith and because the weather had decided to be magnanimous in a way that made everyone suspicious. Ezra arrived with grease on his sleeve and a grin that meant he had convinced someone to do something dignified, and he brought three boys who had learned to sprint between cars and not die, and he brought the locksmith who refused to admit he had come to watch and insisted he was there to judge posture. Lila stood with her back to a pillar and called advice that sounded like scolding and scolded in a tone that felt like care, and when someone asked her what they were training for she said that the person who demands a plan before they pick up their feet will always be late. A girl whose braid would not hold said she did not want to be chosen last by captains anymore even in games that were not real, and Tomas told her that no captain worth anything would choose last, and she rolled her eyes and told him he was very good at prettifying disappointment.\n\nA boy brought a copy of the pamphlet to his grandmother and she read it aloud in a courtyard where the laundry trapped the sun, and two men who had not spoken in a decade agreed on one sentence and allowed themselves the luxury of pretending that was a reconciliation. In an office where the carpet felt like a lie, a woman penciled a schedule for officers to stand in unattractive weather at the edges of courts and pretended she was planning for safety and not for spectacle, and then she put down her pencil and walked outside and took her jacket off and tried the drill in high heels and did not fall, which taught her something she did not intend to learn. In the Hall, beneath the bronze, Ana\u00efs replaced flowers that had wilted with a dish of olives because she had decided the building needed salt, and she found the orange at the base of the case and held it to her face and smelled the day someone took a risk and did not go to jail for it, and she put the orange in her bag because the building was not going to eat it and she liked a fruit with a use.\n\nBy the weekend the city had decided that if the crack was going to be with them it might as well be given a chair at the table, and there were shirts that made it into a joke and then into a prayer and then back into a joke again, which is the proper route for symbols if you do not want them to grow too tall. The ordinance changed its angle twice and shed two unsettling verbs and acquired one new noun, and Mira adjusted her jaw like a woman choosing a necklace that says something without getting her robbed. The Book learned to list Tomas as an address when people searched for directions to a thing that did not have one, and it blinked and hummed and then let the error go because the algorithm had been taught, one time in a flood, to step aside when human traffic needed the lane. Tomas walked to his mother\u2019s on Sunday with a bag of soup and two oranges and a deck of cards, and he knocked three-twos and a pause because superstition had joined his growing toolbox and was proving heavier than expected.\n\nShe made fun of his hair and then touched his face in the doorway because those actions share an origin, and she asked him how long he planned to be young enough to get away with momentum as a strategy. He told her he was tired, not in a way that complained but in a way that admitted he had begun to understand he would have to be, and she poured him soup and told him to eat it before it cooled into philosophy. They played, and she cheated again, and he caught her this time and she was pleased because being caught means you were seen, and she told him there would come a week when he would regret asking the city to behave like a person and not a machine and that she would be there to accept his apology when his feelings were bruised. He told her there would come a week when he would be grateful he had asked at all, and that he would bring her oranges then too, and she waved a hand and asked him to go to the market with her because the woman at the fish stall needed to be told her sign was misspelled and would not accept the correction from anyone who did not look like a person\u2019s son.\n\nOn the way back from the market a van crept down the street like a thought someone did not want to say and then did, and Lila stepped from a doorway like a woman changing her mind about quitting a job and put her shoulder into the world just enough to make space. She did not look at Tomas because the role required indifference, and she told the driver she had reports of a sinkhole ahead and a very old woman who wanted to exorcise it and that the van would be better off avoiding both religion and unplanned geology for an hour. The driver recognized the tone that saves you paperwork later and turned, muttering the way men do when they suspect they are being cared for and do not know what to do with the kindness. Tomas stood with his mother\u2019s bag of fish in his hands and felt, for the first time without flinching, the outline of an army he might be capable of assembling, not an army of uniforms and commands but of benches and drills and refusals at precisely the right decibel. He thought of Mira and of the pin and of the way her mind had traced his absence like a calligrapher unwillingly admiring a rival\u2019s hand, and he thought of Ana\u00efs and the olives, and he thought of Ezra\u2019s scar and the locksmith\u2019s resignation, and he thought of his sister\u2019s laugh over a train bell, and he thought that if respect were a resource, they had been treating it like a statue when it wanted to be a rope.\n\nThat night, he took the pamphlet and wrote on the back with a pen that leaked sometimes and made his fingers look like he had been handling blueberries. He wrote down names paired with places, not to command them to be there but to remind himself where kindness had agreed to be bold: laundry, bridge, market, bench, gym, hall, classroom, stoop. He saw on the paper the beginnings of a net not made of metrics but of habits, and he understood with the slow solemnity of a revelation that the Book had never been a book to begin with, merely a loud room where people had been told to whisper into a single microphone. He did not know whether he was making a better room or simply another microphone, and he closed his eyes on that tremor because doubt is the seasoning that keeps you from poisoning anyone by accident. In another building, a law hardened by two signatures and a press release, and in the morning a field somewhere would be painted over with a brighter white and the edges would look crisper and less forgiving, and the children would trip on them and learn again the geometry of running and stopping and choosing which is harder.The evening Mira promised arrived wearing good manners like gloves, and the city accepted them because it likes to be courted in public before it is told what to do. All day the procurement teams called the candles lights and arranged them in boxes that felt like shipping kindness, and the feeds softened their fonts and practiced a tone that suggested grief had learned posture. The ordinance with the aspirational name had shed two of its more officious verbs after committee and acquired a clause about flexibility at the discretion of trained officers, which worried the people who worried, and relieved the people who preferred to be told these things were under control. On the trains, hands that did not usually carry anything carried white paper bags with strings of wax peeking like shy ideas, and the Book trailered beneath its banners a request for calm in the timbre of a mother at the end of a long day.\n\nTomas did not dress differently because costume would have felt like a lie even if he was arriving at a performance. He folded fifty sheets into his pocket with the same embarrassment a man feels carrying flowers for himself, and he put two oranges in his coat because superstition had become a form of inventory. He met Ezra at the edge of a square that cleaned itself on Saturdays and now shone like a conscience, and they stood watching the city arrange itself into versions of itself, the way you watch a crowd compose a photograph that will become the reference point for a year. The locksmith came in wool despite the warmth and positioned himself near a tree in case any metal decided to misbehave in his presence, and he looked as if he might scold a hinge for squeaking too publicly. Lila did not arrive so much as never leave; she had been at the edges of it all day, a kneecap in the city\u2019s stride, deciding when to apply pressure.\n\nMira took the stage when the hour made silhouettes flattering, and she did not bring the Mayor up with her because she understood ratios. She wore white because her hair had taught her the uses of monochrome, and she spoke briefly because the city had sat through enough long speeches to use the carpet as a mirror. She talked about rooms and light and history that refuses to be a flat painting, and she did not say ball because the word sounded like play, but she gestured in a way that made every camera line up the crack with her profile. She asked for nothing and suggested a posture, and then she stepped back and let a choir of schoolchildren sing not a hymn but a round about names, the sort of song that had traveled classrooms for two generations without flags being attached to it, and that felt like safety to people who were out of practice.\n\nAna\u00efs stood in the Hall with her hands lightly folded, not prayer but readiness, and she looked at the glass with an expression you reserve for friends you have already forgiven for something they have not yet admitted. The guards were bored and trying to hide it, which is a species of courage no one applauds. The case breathed in the manner of expensive things, which is to say only when you get too close. The ball sat cheaply and grandly inside its square like a saint who will never be canonized officially because enough grandmothers decided it was done. People came in two at a time and then three and then in clusters that moved with the choreography of decency rather than that of instruction, and Ana\u00efs watched a woman in a suit put her hand on her husband\u2019s sleeve not to control him but to adjust his angle toward the scuff that meant the story had stopped being an advertisement.\n\nThe plan for the evening from the side that does not write speeches was a circle, nothing more sophisticated than a diagram turned into motion. Ezra had drawn it in chalk that would not show on the stone and then had the sense to step back and let the crowd erase it with their feet. He started the first pass near the second fountain, where a statue pretended not to notice pigeons, and Tomas took up the other end by the bronze woman who holds a whistle like a sceptre. They did not bark orders; they asked questions that had been rehearsed in basements and on benches. If a person wanted to move to the pillar, they pointed to the person behind them and said, Your turn. If a person wanted to stand still, they opened their hand and let someone else pass through. It was small and infuriatingly gentle, the sort of revolution that leaves your shoelaces tied and your eyes a little wet because someone did not jostle you when you expected it and had prepared a defense for the jostle.\n\nAt first the Book misfiled what it saw as milling because its categories are good at distinguishing bodies but not at recognizing grace, and that gave them three minutes to be beautiful without commentary. When the Keepers\u2019 van hummed closer and found the nearest sensible place to be, which was slightly in the way, Lila stood at the edge of the circle and adjusted it by a degree and a sentence until the people moving were the ones who were impatient and the ones standing still were the ones who wanted to feel useful. Order arrived disguised as courtesy and took a breath no one heard. The van settled into the chug of an animal that has learned to wait. The junior inside, jaw squared for regrets he hoped to earn, watched the movement and wrote it off as the sort of thing citizens invent when asked to entertain themselves.\n\nThe provocation, when it arrived, came from the usual place: a man who believed damage is a kind of confession and who mistrusted an evening without an opportunity to be more important than his neighbors. He did not throw a flare at the Hall because Lila would have broken his wrist before his shoulder decided, and because even that kind of foolishness had learned to be self-protective. He tried instead to spray a slogan on the plinth of the bronze ball, a sentence that had been the title of an article last week and an epithet the week before, and he shook the can in a way that made the little ball inside clatter like a bell. The circle near him tightened and then loosened, a strange pulse that made space for Lila\u2019s hand without making its hunger obvious, and in that pause a boy of nine stepped in and put his palm flat on the stone where the paint would have landed, and the man did not know how to proceed because his target had turned into a child\u2019s hand. Lila took the can at the wrist and removed it with the sort of efficiency that graduates you into gentleness, and she passed it to a grandmother who had appeared from somewhere with a bag and the bag took the can as if it were a cucumber. The boy looked at his hand as if it had been held up by gravity, and then he went back to kicking his sock-ball at his sister, and the city allowed itself the surprise of a moment that did not escalate.\n\nMira watched from the stage and did not use her microphone because this was not hers to speak over, and she filed away the image of the grandmother with the cucumber-bag, because if she would be using this night later she would prefer the metaphor kept its realism. When the choir finished singing the names round, she addressed them as if she had noticed they had done something difficult well, which is the sort of compliment that keeps children from having to become officers later to feel valuable. She said, and she meant it in the way she allowed herself to mean things without flinching, that light was useful only if it was not weaponized, and she let the word crack appear on her tongue only once, and she pointed at it on the feed because she was not an idiot and because claiming a symbol early is how you protect it from people who have leisure to ruin it systematically.\n\nThe vigil had that soft ending that crowds invent when they are determined not to be orchestrated, and candles were pinched neatly instead of crushed like vanguards under a heel, and the square exhaled into streets that learned their lessons for the hour and then reverted to habit because cities are merciful to their own defects. Tomas felt the cutter\u2019s tug of adrenaline let go and in its absence the ache of having been good, a low hum in the bones that had nothing to do with righteousness and everything to do with not standing on the outside of his day. Ezra clapped him on the shoulder with a friend\u2019s brutality and told him that at least he had not been poetic in public, which deserved a pin, and the locksmith cited three doors that had enjoyed being opened without being impressed by themselves and suggested it could become standard practice if the city learned to trust its own wrists.\n\nThe ordinance became a pamphlet overnight, the way laws do when the nervous need to see them in their kitchens to believe in them, and Tomas found one tumbling in the gutter and read it while walking because that was how it wanted to be consumed. The guided routes had been softened into suggestions, with a collapsible list of \u201cconditions of agitation\u201d that would stand in court like a curtain does in a draft, proving only that a room is not entirely sealed. The clause about officer discretion had been italicized, which is the font you use when you want to whisper and be obeyed, and the diagrams were pretty because pretty sells fear to people who think they had their fill of it last year. He folded it into a square with the confidence of a boy who had learned to make paper into a ball and bounced it twice off a wall to hear if the sound had changed. It had not.\n\nThey raided the locksmith the next morning the way men who have been told to prove their relevance raid a bakery they suspect of selling wheat without stamps. It was polite and thorough to the degree that signals training and resentment; they asked where he had gotten the copper for the imitation rings and lectured him about fashioning lies, and he listened with the calm of someone who had survived three currencies and one winter when everyone learned how to reinforce windows with dignity. He lifted the late-model chips into the teapot by the register as if making tea and set down in their place a row of antique skeleton keys, an apology in metallurgy. When they left, he locked his door twice for the first time in a year and sent a boy with a very good sense of direction to tell Tomas, not because his shop was in danger but because someone needed to be reminded that the city had ears and no obligation to be kind when it got curious.\n\nMira summoned Tomas to her office without doing him the discourtesy of pretending it was a coincidence, and he went in with the exact caution of a man carrying something he could not ask the metal detector to ignore. The building breathed him and did not find the old pulse because the imitation ring was too polite to draw attention to itself, and that was an omen he would misinterpret later. Inside, the office looked like a photograph of a room that has seen a better argument, and Mira did him the honor of not pointing to a chair as if she were a hostess. She told him, still standing because some concessions need to be staged quite carefully, that she had no interest in arresting him as long as his next act did not humiliate her in front of people who were already predisposed to enjoy her humiliation. He told her he lacked the imagination to stage a humiliation sufficiently refined to satisfy her critics, which was a compliment if you understood the nerve required to say it.\n\nShe made him an offer that did not insult either of them so much as it tickled their old loyalties. He could pair again in a fashion that was half-ceremonial, join a pilot for teaching crowd management that avoided the word control, allow his pamphlet to be printed on better paper with a seal peeking out of the corner like a chaperone, and in exchange he would be given a radius inside of which no one would test his sincerity with handcuffs. For a minute he saw the elegance of it the way architects admire an arch, and then he saw the way it would turn his movement into an accessory, and he told her that he could bring his drills and his citrus to the city\u2019s stages if she promised to let failure be public and not to call it treason when a circle broke. She smiled in a way that taught him something about her he would not be able to use later, and she said she could promise it until Friday.\n\nLila watched the building adapt to having him inside it again, as if their conversation had fetched him back into the visible spectrum. She took the file her supervisor handed her with the air of a woman accepting the weather and read inside it a set of cautions that amount to affection when your employer is a city. Observe without discouraging, intervene without interrupting, permit the optics of kindness and suppress the optics of drift. She allowed herself the long private exhalation of a person who knows their job is to stand between a creative force and a law and keep both of them from embarrassing themselves, and she went downstairs and bought a packet of sunflower seeds because a courtyard nearby liked to be littered with something you could pretend was an innocent habit.\n\nThe schools adopted the part of the ordinance that makes the Book proud even when it is sad: the ask for rings to be worn visible for safety, the suggestion of routes, the language about supervision that makes teachers revolt briefly in stairwells and then go back to inventing workarounds. His sister called and emptied the sound of a bell into his ear by holding the phone near the hallway during change of class, and she laughed under her breath when she told him that eight girls in her second class had threaded baker\u2019s twine through their rings and made them into pendants and then tucked them inside their shirts, and that when the keeps-everything-straight administrator asked why, they said modesty and were not contradicted. He went to stand outside her school at dismissal, not to commit spectacle but to measure the city\u2019s evenness, and he saw the routes push and pause and adjust with the softness that will keep a child from turning into a clerk when she grows. He bought oranges and put them at two corners, not as charms but as promises, and the mothers smiled at him and allowed him to exist because he was holding fruit and not a megaphone.\n\nIn the Hall, the label Ana\u00efs had written in pencil survived the first wave of committees simply because no one had the stamina to object to a sentence that did not lean its weight on anyone, and under it the ball sat with a crack showing like an ankle, which in this city has always made people braver than they intended to be. She allowed a reporter to ask a polite question and she answered it with discourtesy disguised as a story about paint that did not match, and the reporter snuck her words onto a feed with a caption that made it sound as if the news had come up with the anecdote itself, and she went home tired and did not mind that the exhaustion had a tone she had missed. She bought two oranges on the way because she had begun to understand the currency they represented, and when she reached her stoop a girl with a braid asked if she could smell them, and Ana\u00efs handed one over and let the girl breathe it as if it were a book.\n\nThe city learned the shape of Tomas\u2019s refusal like a new piece of furniture in a familiar room, stubbed into it twice, and then rearranged itself to avoid bruising the same shin again. He discovered the limits of his ring\u2019s courtesy when he tried to collect his pay from an account that had been made conditional on acknowledgment of a tool he had taught himself to live without, and he stood in the bank with his palms open and told the young woman behind the glass that he could not offer recognition and that he had brought the paper of his pay in a file he could show her, and she did the math of decency and let the transaction proceed because sometimes discretion is just a clerk choosing not to ask a question. He slept one night in the gym because his building\u2019s lock decided to be proud and then ashamed and then obstinate, and the sound of Ezra\u2019s snore was both an insult and a benediction, and in the morning he washed his face in a sink that had been taught humility by years of chalk and sweat, and he felt human enough to continue.\n\nThey printed more sheets and did not call them anything, and the map of places grew into a list that lived on paper and in elbows: the laundry that would store your bag if you promised to wash two loads for strangers on Tuesdays; the bridge where children would be taught a pattern and then insist on teaching it to their uncles; the market where oranges were cheaper on Wednesdays for people who wore their imitation rings inward or not at all; the bench where old men would adopt two seats and make anyone who sat between them answer a question about whether respect was more like salt or like a broom. The Book tried briefly to categorize oranges as suspicious and then, when that misfire began to go badly on the feeds, surrendered and filed them as produce again, which is part of what keeps people sane in systems older than they are.\n\nMira visited her tailor after the evening because it calms the mind to have an old woman accuse you of wanting shoulders too broad for your actual guilt, and she let herself be pinned and prodded and teased into considering the fabric of a season in which she would have to move a fraction more like a penitent and a fraction less like a monarch. She instructed two Keepers to stand on a corner she knew would become important because respect had gone and gotten itself an address, and she made sure their orders included an admonition about their expressions because she did not want photographs of a scowl near a child learning to stand in a circle. She wrote one sentence in her own hand at the bottom of a memo and it said: This city thinks with its feet when you let it, and she put it in a folder that did not belong to any of her staff because she was sentimental in ways only she would notice.\n\nOn a Monday that refused to be better than it had to be, Lila found a notice in her box that might as well have been a summons, and it was written not in legal grammar but in the smaller cruelties of an institution that has decided to refine your purpose. She was to monitor the phenomenon in the squares and the courts and provide regular guidance, which looked like expertise until you read the line about escalation thresholds and understood that her job was not to bless a practice but to stand near it with scissors. She took the notice and used its clean edge to slice a dangling thread from her sleeve, and she told herself that this is what a decent bureaucrat does when asked to scratch at a callus: you tend to the finger with one hand and keep the other out of the socket. She met Tomas at a corner crowded with sunlight and told him that if he intended to make something permanent he should plan to watch it be stolen, and he told her that he had no intention of calling permanence anything but courteous stubbornness until they survived a winter.\n\nThe second crackdown arrived not as boots but as questions, because someone had decided to teach the public to ask for credentials again like a habit you put down for a season and have to be shown where it goes on the table. Men who were unused to being asked to carry proof of their names rediscovered indignation like an heirloom and polished it in caf\u00e9s until the waiters got tired and asked them to drink or leave. Women who had long since learned the physics of being weighed by glances decided to provide papers proactively and then look at the faces of the readers until some of those faces broke into something human. Tomas had nothing to show and could show it with a clean conscience, and he learned a new way to keep his hands, palms out, fingers splayed, not surrender and not threat but a posture you want to invent if you have no desire to be dragged into a room without windows.\n\nHis mother learned to carry oranges in her bag as if they were a prescription, and she began slicing them on her stoop and passing segments to any child who would take one without asking for a better story than thirst, and she told her sister that she did not intend to be anyone\u2019s symbol and that the day would come when her son would be punished for letting her become one. She withheld her game of cards one Sunday because punishment needs practice, and she watched his face learn that love and discipline are not two teams in a stadium but two halves of a rule. He went away after soup with the particular heaviness that announces a necessary humility and worked it out on a kitchen wall until someone banged with a broom, and he apologized to a ceiling and meant it.\n\nThe flood wandered back into the city\u2019s memory as summer drew itself up and made the river impatient, and in that collective shiver Tomas found a grammar he could use without calculation. He began to talk about drills as if he were asking someone to move a couch, and he found that when he framed respect as the art of not dropping something heavy on your neighbor\u2019s foot most people wanted to learn. He took to carrying a sketchbook like a tourist and drew diagrams of square corners and arcs of movement and the posture of a person braced to lift, and when people asked him if he was an artist he said no, which made them generous, and when they asked if he was a soldier he smiled and did not answer, which made them careful. He went to a hardware store and bought twelve hex keys and handed them out one at a time to people who had fathers or mothers who had taught them not to turn in a hurry, and he told each of them to fix one small thing in the city and then not to talk about it until someone else noticed.\n\nOn a day Mira had marked for meetings and instead filled with silence and tea because exhaustion had come to collect its bill, the Mayor made a joke about oranges and received laughter that taught her it was not yet hers to make, and in the Hall a child brought a lemon and put it next to the case because her mother had run out of the other fruit, and Ana\u00efs did not move it because substitution is a form of faith. Ezra lost a game underground and celebrated it because losing had become rare courtesy, and the locksmith taught a girl to seat a pin so gently that the lock sighed and then agreed, and Lila wrote three words on her palm that would not transfer to other surfaces no matter how much she wanted them to: patience beats pride. Tomas sat on a bench and wrote that he would rename nothing and that names are a way to close a hand, and he looked at his own hands and thought for a second that two oranges were quite a lot to ask of a person, and then the boy with the scar came by and stole one and peeled it and handed him a segment without explaining why we share, and he accepted, which is a language too.The river did its old trick of pretending to be asleep and then opening its eyes all at once. It came up with the specific indifference of water that remembers a route no one taught it, creeping first into alleys that had been repaved since the last time and did not think of themselves as vulnerable, then into the undersides of bridges where pigeons had enjoyed sovereignty, and then into basements like a guest who declines the good chair and sits on the stairs instead. The weather menaced in courteous phrases because the Book had taught even clouds to consider the optics, and the alerts arrived like toasts at a wedding wherein everyone was trying not to mention a cousin who always ruined the cake. People said it like gossip because that is how you make fear absorbable: up a finger\u2019s width on the south gauge, a palm on the east, the Old Quarter flirting with the third step already, better bring in the rugs.\n\nLila heard it first as a change in the footfalls on her stairwell. The building had a particular composure when it rained and another when it flooded, and this morning it had chosen the latter, filling with the quick polite steps of people determined to be on the useful side of necessity. She checked the routes the Book suggested and watched three little animated flows try to use the same narrowing of street by the bronze woman with the whistle, and she swore under her breath not at the flood but at the diagram. The revised ordinance had already imagined this\u2014guided routes for agitation, suggested paths for order\u2014and it did the wrong thing beautifully now, channeling everyone toward a choke point so photogenic it felt cruel. She called it in to Mira and said, not in code because sometimes clarity is the kindness you offer a superior, that if they did not break their own rails for an hour they would be explaining to grandmothers why high heels make poor paddles.\n\nMira was at her desk with a damp pin on her lapel and a jug of coffee that had been attempting to look authoritative. She had lived through three floods and a coup that had only been named that after it failed, and she understood the art of arresting a reflex. She walked to the window and watched the river try on a new bank like a dress it might keep, and she told Lila calmly to walk the routes closed by remembering which doors the city liked to leave ajar. She called three Keepers and told them their discretion was now policy. She called the Mayor and told her not to wear boots on camera because the boots would make apologies look like vanity. She sent a note to the Book in the only language it always processed before any other\u2014maintenance\u2014and requested, on behalf of Civic Flow, an emergency widening of the deletion throttle for rerouting notices, because now was not the time for arguments with a system about dignity. She wrote in her own hand at the bottom of the memo: Let the feet choose.\n\nTomas woke to the city making the sound it makes when it is thinking about drowning. He put one orange in his pocket and then another because superstition is not something you fight on a day that asks for obedience to older gods. He slid the imitation ring to the middle joint of his finger and willed it to behave, then put his ear to the window because the water speaks to people with no microphones if you let it. It said the simplest thing a river ever says, which is hurry wisely. He went out and found Ezra already on the steps with a coil of rope that seemed tired of living in a bag and eager to be a line between two obligations, and they did not argue because floods do not enjoy debate. They went to the bridge first, where a cluster of people had gathered to be clever and take pictures, and Ezra banged a rhythm on the railing that managed to be both festive and alarming, which is the form of punctuation a crowd will obey if it has just been given something worthwhile to do.\n\nThe drills had been a kindness when they were pretend; now they were a permission. Tomas put down his sheets and did not apologize for his own handwriting. He took chalk from a boy who looked proud of the theft and drew three arrows on the ground that would defy the Book\u2019s purpler map, and then he moved until people\u2019s eyes found his shoulders and used them as law. He did not bark, he asked in the tone of someone handing you something heavy that he does not want to drop on your foot. The circle was a corridor now, the dotted line a chain made of patience and rope. The market gave up its oranges because fruit prefers to be eaten but will substitute itself as a bright mark whenever the city is confused, and they laid the fruit on stairwells and at the head of a slope into the subway so people would know which direction the favor ran. Ezra took three boys and taught them how to lock a gate open without bending the metal\u2019s feelings, and the locksmith appeared like a condemnation with a hand saw and a bag of apologies and began to talk to hinges the way you talk to the last stubborn relative at a wedding table.\n\nThe Book tried to follow and then tripped. Its routes looked clean on a screen but in the wet the corners changed their angles like cats crossing a room, and the rings began to stutter: agitated, relaxed, wet, unauthorized, wet. The emergency gates at the Hall blinked themselves into an ethical crisis; they had been taught to open for women and for emergency badges and for the official stanchions of a filmed tour, but not for the messy, uncoiffed flow of a city deciding in a hurry to be decent. Tomas reached the back door and presented the polite lie of his ring and got a refusal that tasted like tin, and before he could retry the old developer trick, Lila stepped from the lobby\u2019s shadow and pressed the heel of her hand at the precise point where old wood flirts with pride. The door learned again the muscle memory of a good shove. It opened as if ashamed of being an obstacle. She did not look at him and he did not thank her, because the city had been designed to be grateful to itself in emergencies, and they both respected the architecture.\n\nInside, Ana\u00efs had made her decision before she stood up. You move the labels first, not because they are more precious than the objects but because they are light and they remind you what language you planned to use when you were less afraid. She went through the gallery with her arms full of laminated sentences and set them high, and then she stood before the case and looked at the ball as if it might say do not fuss. She did not intend to be the curator who drowned protecting a sphere, but she also did not intend to present the city with a headline that suggested it had lost its nerve and its original sin in the same night. She turned down the Book\u2019s eyes in the room because grief should not be asked to give good angles, and she called out to the boys with the rope in a voice that no one heard as pleading because age had given it a condescending clarity. They sandbagged the door that liked to fail in warm weather. She told a girl in a jacket to stand by the photograph of the goal and explain to anyone who would listen why the paint had mismatched on the railings in the old stadium, because floods require distractions as much as they require bags of dirt.\n\nThe first wave reached the hall like a guest who had memorized the address properly and wished to leave a gift. It put two inches on the floor in the service corridor and then reconsidered entering the lobby because the angles were wrong and the crowd\u2019s posture was discouraging of insult. A boy whose boots had been made for puddles and policy sloshed in and found a bucket and was instantly important in the way nine-year-olds are when a room is misbehaving. The case fogged; the crack became a white line as unapologetic as chalk. Someone took a picture because you cannot help it; everyone else turned to sand with their hands. Lila took two Keepers in their crisp uniforms by their elbows and smiled at them with such warmth that it took them four minutes to realize they were stacking bags at a pace she had not permitted herself in a year. Ezra\u2019s rope decided it would be a chain barrier and then thought better of its vocation and became a dragline for the nearest drain. The locksmith found a grate that had lost its screws to enthusiasm two administrations earlier and put it back in line with a hex and a murmur.\n\nAcross the river, guided routes on screens in buses updated themselves with the desperate confidence of a person who carries a map and refuses to ask a child for directions. Congestion happened where congestion always happens when people mistake pretty lines for streets, and a necessary panic began to practice its vowels. Mira went to the rotunda with its sickly acoustics and told a roomful of microphones that the city had been asked to solve puzzles before and had solved them with its knees as often as with its chin. She named, without naming, the people calling the drills at the corners and the boys who had learned how to get a gate to open for a kid and a dog at the same time, and when a Keeper\u2019s supervisor asked on a very live channel whether this was an endorsement of unauthorized civil practice, she said calmly that it was a suspension of enforcement and an endorsement of survival. The Mayor arrived in boots that were not a joke and stood behind her as if she had learned in a single hour the etiquette of second chairs. Someone in the corner counted this as a victory and put it in a file. Mira watched them and decided to follow up later and make certain it did not become a performance.\n\nTomas learned a thing that day about design. A circle that had been a drill could be turned into a wheel that pulled a person out of a street when a car decided it wanted to be a boat. Four people in a square could make a ladder if you were generous with your shoulders. If you asked an old woman to hold a rope and told her what it was attached to, she would hold it until her hands blistered and then find someone with younger skin to take over without false ceremony. The oranges that had been wayfinding became floats for a minute and then signals bobbing at the mouths of alleys, a constellation that taught the aerial cameras humility because they could not see the pattern clearly enough to name it. He catalogued silently which corners held because the children already knew where the water would go, and which failed because someone had once rewritten a curb in a report and forgotten to tell the curb.\n\nIn the middle of the hurry there were the odd small graces. A woman who had always been careful with her voice found herself shouting orders to two men and liked the sound sufficiently to look embarrassed later in private. A Keeper who had been trained to make his presence an argument discovered that if he took off his hat children did what he asked faster. A boy whose father had told him never to be first at anything for fear of mistakes moved first anyway because a cat needed help getting out of a basement window and he recognized, without learning it, that there are rules and there are cats. A man in a wool coat who had never reached into a stranger\u2019s bag without asking took the oranges out because the bag would float better lightened and for once didn\u2019t ask to be forgiven.\n\nThey lost some things and pretended not to weep. Carpets went the way of all rugs in cities that have opinions about rivers. A school\u2019s collection of outdated atlases became pulp in a hallway that for a week will smell like regret. A photograph in a frame on a stoop of a man who had not come home from a younger flood went soft, and his daughter picked up the wet paper and flattened it under the glass again because it felt more faithful to suppose that the man\u2019s face had simply learned to live in water. The Hall kept the ball, and if that sentence felt proud to Ana\u00efs as she thought it, she forgave herself because the cases are not meant to be funerals.\n\nBy afternoon the river found its ceiling in the neighborhood where the brick remembers better than the concrete. The city exhaled in increments because it had learned not to be greedy with relief. Lila stood with her hands on her hips and allowed herself to notice the pain that had taken up lodging under her rib when the sirens started, then put her hands down because posture becomes a habit and she did not want to teach a new generation of girls to hold themselves in readiness for too long. The Keepers who had been sent to police postures found themselves stacking crates and repeating jokes they hoped would convert panic into rhythm. The van that had waited earlier for an excuse now idled like an old cat, clean and without purpose. The ordinance, in a small miracle of bureaucratic grace that she would later pretend she had planned, read to her in a new draft as If the water exceeds the curb by more than three inches the routes are suggestions and the officers are citizens until the second bell.\n\nMira gave away credit the way expensive women give away compliments\u2014measured, sparkling, clearly expensive\u2014and that is why it worked. She mentioned the boys with the ropes by their first names on a feed that did not usually carry names unless there was a title attached. She mentioned the oranges without charming herself, which would have been fatal, and then noted the laundry that had kept bags safe and the gym that had let people sleep and the bridge where a girl had counted and kept count even when her own mother needed a hand. The Book stuttered in the way it does when you ask it to tell a story instead of to count, and then it learned. It began to file certain movements under a new tag\u2014pattern: courtesy\u2014and someone with a sense of humor in a room Tomas would never see named a category of behavior respect not because they believed it but because they wanted to be on the side of an argument that was beginning to look like funding.\n\nAt dusk, when the city has always looked best at forgiving, the water began to make a sound like a crowd after a concert, tired and pleased with itself and ready to eat. People picked up their shoes and then their judgments and carried them home. Ana\u00efs sat in the office with the plant and the stool and washed her hands in a bowl because the taps had elected piety and refused to work. She did not pray at the ball, and she did not call anyone a hero, and she took the orange from the base of the case and cut it and ate it deliberately and thought, This city remembers best when the memory has a taste.\n\nThe morning after, the oranges caught in the railings looked like a row of small suns hung out to dry. Children walked to school with their socks damp and their mouths full of commentary because they had discovered the crowd would listen to them if they talked in declarative sentences about who needed to be lifted next time. The locksmith opened his shop despite the wet and hung on the door a sign that read in his precise hand: Keys for doors stuck by damp pride. He expected to be raided again and looked forward to arguing about adjectives. Ezra found his rope heavy with the silt of useful work and draped it over a radiator as if it were laundry, hummed a tune that might have been older than the game, and allowed himself the little private disgust a man still feels about crying in public even when the public is busy.\n\nTomas walked the path the Book said he should and then the one the water had, and then the one his feet wanted, and he offered help where help had learned to be asked for politely. He saw the places where their drills had fit exactly into the city and the places where they had not, and he wrote two lists because lists comfort men who have been entrusted with a feeling they did not ask to own. He went to his mother\u2019s and unclogged the drain with a metal hanger and a patience that had not died with his father, and when she said nothing about the flood or the oranges or the boys saving cats, he understood that her silence was the only way she could give him back his peace without diminishing herself. She set down soup and told him she would not be wearing boots to any vigils, and he told her he would not be the person to ask her to.\n\nMira received three letters hand-delivered by couriers who had learned to roll their trousers to the knee and keep their socks dry. One was from the Mayor\u2019s office and contained three compliments and a suggestion that next time the optics might be tidier; she placed it under her water glass and watched the ink run. One was from a club of women with long memories and longer knives, congratulating her on a decision their grandmothers had recommended in letters none of the current staff had ever bothered to read; she wrote them back and said, you can thank Ana\u00efs instead and do it with olives. The third letter had no sender and only one sentence, which said: we will not embarrass you unless you make us lonely, and she put that one in a drawer with a birthday card and the membership pin from the time she had allowed herself to be in a club that wanted her.\n\nLila stood in a meeting where the woman with the face of a saint and the habit of a butcher attempted to turn the flood into a set of metrics. She listened quietly to the polite brutality of a chart and then put her hand up only once to say that the number of people who raised their hands to carry something heavy counts for more than the number of times a route was obeyed. She was told to put it in an email because the Book cannot change its mind without a noun to pin to a graph, and she smiled and did what she was told because sometimes obedience is a way of resting. After, she went to the bridge where the chalk had been replaced with a smear and considered the river like an enemy who might one day be a friend if you both ended up at the same table by chance. Tomas appeared with two oranges and a look that suggested exhaustion had decided to be handsome for once, and he handed her one and said nothing because they had earned the right to be quiet together for a minute.\n\nThe flood washed one secret into the open. A neighbor who had lived at the edge of the boys\u2019 basement court had stood in his doorway and told Ezra\u2019s wife that he remembered the old man with the red box and the patience of the slow twist. He had been there the night Tom\u00e1s\u2019s father had waded in too far to fix the power on a floodlight at the end of the street so that an ambulance could see the hole where a car had gone down. He had told him not to, and he had done it anyway, and the light had come on for three minutes and given a dozen people the exact amount of clarity they had required to cross a street in the right direction, and then the current had, as they say in official reports, rearranged him for good. Tomas listened and thought not of heroism but of torque, of that last slow turn that a person offers a thing that does not intend to yield and then does. He went home and took the little hex key he had begun to carry and put it on the windowsill where the sun would teach it patience.\n\nAfter the flood there were the small meetings that are not meetings. A laundry agreed with a corner store that oranges would be cheaper on days when the river coughs. The gym posted hours that meant men could sleep there when their buildings had decided to pretend they were boats. A school practiced a drill that did not carry the scent of terror but did include mothers and three very impatient dogs. Ana\u00efs started a ledger on paper that listed which local histories could be moved upstairs fastest by children and which required lifting with hands that had lifted a couch, and she wrote herself a small, stern note about not crying where cameras could find her. The locksmith taught a girl to rekey her own bedroom door because a girl should not have to ask, and when her mother looked dubious he said, gently, that being safe had always been the origin of manners. Lila ordered her unit to carry sunflower seeds and a spare rope, and the new boy laughed and then, to his credit, bought the seeds.\n\nThe Book learned a new trick so slowly it was almost touching. It started to send messages that were not commands to certain rings when a certain tag was crossed with a certain weather, and the message did not say obey or proceed. It said ask, and then, as if it could not help itself, it said: thank you. Tomas saw one on someone else\u2019s screen over a shoulder on a bus and almost dropped his orange because there is nothing more dangerous in a city than a system that has decided to learn politeness. He pressed developer mode almost without intending to and saw, in the quiet hum of the maintenance logs, a line that said: Anomaly: pattern\u2014courtesy\u2014reduced fatalities at Bridge C by 17% (estimated). He closed it quickly because he did not want to develop the habit of looking for applause in other people\u2019s code.\n\nHe took one day to be foolish and took his sister to the Hall, because you do not tempt memory too often if you do not want it to become an adversary. They stood before the case and she made fun of the pomp, and he made fun of her making fun, and Ana\u00efs caught them and pretended to scold because scolding is how you welcome people who have done the work without asking for a ribbon. A child stared at the crack as if it were the first polite imperfection she had been taught to enjoy, and the boy with the scar stood farther back because some love is better at a distance. Lila came in at the back, not in uniform, and stood a minute with her hands open as if to show she was not on duty and then left because she had paperwork for once and paperwork, if done with decency, can be a form of prayer.\n\nWhen the water finally retreated like a shy actress and left the city to sweep its own stage, Tomas went to the river with his red box, which was not his father\u2019s but might as well have been for what it carried. He did not toss it in because drama is cheap when it is private. He opened it and took out a key and turned it in his fingers until his hand learned again the patience he would need for the next refusal. He thought of Mira with her white hair and her arithmetic and of her offer dressed up as policy, and he thought of saying yes to certain stages and no to certain microphones, and he thought of Ana\u00efs making her list in pencil and of Ezra\u2019s rope smelling like a basement and of the locksmith hiding chips in his teapot while teaching polite people to press their shoulders into doors with more confidence. He thought of his mother on the stoop handing segments of orange to any child who asked properly, and he thought, not for the first time, that respect might be not a statue or a scarf but a tool you passed down as if it were family.\n\nThe city looked, for a week after, like it had been dipped very quickly in a different mood and set to dry. People carried themselves with the careful exhaustion of a person who has set a room back to rights and is trying not to notice that one chair will now always wobble. The ordinance returned to its quieter clothing and behaved itself with the primness of a rule that has been forgiven, and its clause about officer discretion remained italicized and therefore dangerous. The drills took on the character of older customs, like sweeping a stoop or naming a baby after a piece of the weather that nearly killed you. Tomas stopped correcting people when they called what they were doing a game because he had decided to be done pretending that pleasure and survival are distant cousins.\n\nOn a Wednesday so ordinary it felt brave, Mira convened a meeting she did not name. Ana\u00efs came and brought an empty folder, which is what curators do when they suspect they will be asked to carry something ugly home. Lila came and stood without leaning because leaning could be misinterpreted as weariness in minutes later. The locksmith arrived a full five minutes late on purpose and then apologized elegantly because he had not been invited formally; Ezra sat in the back with a rope on his lap because he liked to see people glance at it and adjust their opinions of what mattered. They talked about scars and whether the city should teach itself to celebrate them, and they talked about the Book and whether it would forgive being taught to whisper please, and they talked about ordinances and italics and what to do about the corner by the bronze woman where the water enjoys practicing cruelty. Mira told them what she could give them officially\u2014three hours of authorized circles a week, one supervisor with a title they would not hate, a line in a budget that would always be too small\u2014and what she could not: safety from curiosity, protection from envy, a guarantee that their oranges would always be read as kindness and never as code. They left with no paper that contained their names and yet with an understanding that had substance, which is increasingly rare in cities that admire signatures.\n\nThe night after, the boys played in the basement with a sock full of sand because the river had taught them the intoxicating difference between weight and mass, and they practiced throwing in a room that had just enough ceiling to punish arrogance. Tomas stood with his back to the wall, the sound of the ball against it an old liturgy in a new church, and let himself, in that unguarded quarter hour, be the boy his father had imagined he might become: someone who does the slow turning of necessary bolts with the precision that will not make headlines and the care that could keep a room from drowning. When he left, he locked the door with the new key, and he did not tell anyone he had left it under the third brick where the mortar cracks, because secrets are only useful if they are useful to more than one person, and the city was finally beginning to remember how to share.The week after the water stepped back as if it had remembered there were other cities to toy with, the oranges began to appear in windows the way candles had when people still believed vigil could stop a law. No one announced it and therefore no one could be accused of announcing it, which satisfied both the tender and the tired. A grocer who had lost three sacks of potatoes and a granddaughter to a good marriage put two fruits on his sill every evening before he set his tally stick on its hook; a woman in a dress she had ironed twice toward the hem and never toward the collar set one behind a pot of basil so it would be visible to anyone with a nose and a need; a barber hung a little net of them over his mirror and told a boy who stared that sometimes a city chooses a color because it wants to feel as if it has a flag that cannot be confiscated. The Book refused to make a banner of any of this, not out of malice but out of confusion, which is, in certain lights, a kind of mercy.\n\nTomas found himself walking slower in neighborhoods where fruit sat in windows, not because he had earned the right to take credit for any of it but because the sight of bright circles being allowed to be only themselves made his shoulders relax the way good music does when someone remembers to modulate at the right bar. He kept the imitation ring polite and his palms visible and discovered the rhythm of a man other people had begun to expect to be present when kindness needed choreography. It embarrassed him; it made his throat warm. He wrote it down as a problem in the back of his head: how to not become necessary in a way that makes other people lazy. He carried the red box a few times without opening it, just to remind his hands they had been trained to turn things that resisted that none of this was a permanent permission or a costume.\n\nMira watched oranges turn into punctuation and decided to let them keep their grammar for as long as the sentence stayed grammatical. The ordinance, which had never been intended to be poetry, acquired two subclauses in her hand that made the legal team sigh with relief because they looked like work and the public roll their eyes because they looked like permission disguised as homework. She had written them in the hour after the flood when her shoes were still wet and she had been inclined to humiliate her enemies and decided instead to make them complicit. She invited a certain set of women\u2014the kind men in her position refer to as \u201cdifficult\u201d when they are not listening\u2014to her office without calling it a listening session because fastidiousness would have ruined the thing, and she let them talk without pretending to take notes. When one of them asked whether oranges would be considered contraband, Mira very nearly smiled and said that contraband used to mean salt, which should teach them humility. She passed out glasses of water that did not taste of pipes. She ignored the Mayor\u2019s aide who kept asking whether there would be a photo and took the pin off her lapel for the second time in a month so it would stop reading as an oath.\n\nIt had been too long since anyone attempted to formalize what he was doing without insulting it. The first insult arrived as flattery: a brand that made shoes your feet would forgive approached him in the guise of a photographer with clean hair and better manners than sense and asked if he would like to star in a campaign about everyday courage, and he said no because he did not want to learn to see his face in windows he did not own. A second insult came as funding: a man with a smooth ring and a laugh he had practiced offered to underwrite printed sheets and a little office in a building that did not yet have rats and would therefore require rent on time every month. Tomas listened politely because his mother had taught him that charity is often just attention someone wants to record, and he declined with the kind of grace that would not earn him enemies now but would cost him later when the man needed, as such men always do, to be seen tearing down what they had failed to purchase. He took the insults as a sign of health. Insults only bother the living.\n\nAna\u00efs Vel was summoned to a room with glass and subtraction and suffered the indignity of being told to sit by a man who had learned to be comfortable without shoes somewhere expensive. He told her, with the confidence of someone who could hire three replacement curators for the cost of the carpet, that the Hall had always thrived when its narrative had been clear and that the recent flirtations with ambiguity, while thrilling to certain donors, had confused the base. She saw three things at once: his vowels, which had not been taught to pronounce the names of the corners of the city; his cufflinks, which made her hands itch for pliers; and the little white at the edges of his nostrils that told her he had lifted something heavy recently and found it heavier than his body believed things to be. \u201cWe sell clarity because clarity pays for the electricity,\u201d he said, and she said, in the voice she had used on sons and husbands and plumbers who wanted to be paid twice for the same accident, that the ball\u2019s crack would stay visible because honesty keeps the lights on longer. He told her there would be a vote. She told him he had already lost it and he asked her to leave because politeness is a leash they hand you when they are about to pull. In the elevator she allowed herself a small wicked grin because she had always loved elevators for their little theatre of containment; in the reflection she looked every inch the old woman in a tapestry with a pair of scissors in her lap, and the thought cheered her enough to get her through the next meeting with a junior who wanted to call her \u201cauntie\u201d and did not.\n\nIn the basement gym the game grew a second skin. The drills that had been drills in public and survival in a flood became practice for something no one wanted to name because names tell on you, and yet people need to point at a thing to talk about it. Ezra called it the circuit because he liked the ugly industrial ring of the word, and everyone pretended to hate it. They began to trace the same pattern at different scales: five bodies and thirteen dots and a dotted line in chalk and then the same pattern across a square with oranges and then the same pattern inside a building where the cameras had been taught to love symmetry and therefore watched all the right wrong things. Tomas did not call it anything. He called the numbers. He sat down with a girl whose father had been a policeman before the Book, and he showed her that the moment you resist is often the moment you double the noise in the room, and she taught him that sometimes noise protects. They were inventing a form of math that might, in another family, have turned into a better version of war.\n\nLila began the week believing she could hold everything she was being asked to hold with one hand while the other made the gestures that persuaded people the state had never meant anyone harm. By Wednesday she had to use both hands, and she did not like the feeling not because it made her look tired but because it meant something in the system had decided to act like a toddler in a doorway, insisting everyone step over it rather than getting up and moving. A new directive had arrived with important italics, reminding her to file weekly reports on informal gatherings that might \u201cconstitute emergent paramilitary formations.\u201d The list of indicators included circles larger than fifteen people, repetitions of a call-and-response not initiated by the authorities, and the presence of fruit used as wayfinding or admission tokens. She read it twice and took a photograph and then ate it because she knew someone who would search her bin a week from now and had decided not to give them the pleasure of finding it intact. When she met Tomas on her lunch break without calling it a meeting, she told him to start acting as if there were faces in every blank space, and he said he had been assuming that since childhood. She told him the word paramilitary had entered the room and he laughed, which is what a sane person does right up until someone knocks at their mother\u2019s door with the other version of the word on a paper with teeth.\n\nThe locksmith received a formal notice alleging that he manufactured devices intended to deceive civic infrastructure and inviting him to attend a voluntary conversation at a place that had the audacity to be called Neutral House. He set the paper under a wobbly table leg and came to the basement that night with his bag of patient metal like a man going to a baptism. He told the room that if anyone wanted a ring that lied, they could have one only if they swore to treat it as a tool and not as a garment, and that if any of the boys in the back had been playing with jammers they had bought with pretend money from someone with a haircut that required attention, he would take them apart and make them read the diagrams aloud until they learned shame. One boy laughed and then, to his credit, shut up and listened. The locksmith made two more rings that hum without consent and watched Tomas not ask for one. He felt an unexpected affection for the not-asking and hid it behind a lecture about temperature and solder.\n\nThe Book, having learned to whisper please to a set of rings during a flood, attempted to generalize courtesy and embarrassed itself. For three days it sent small messages to citizens near benches where drills were happening, messages that read as if they had been written by a careful aunt: Do you need a space? Would you like us to recommend a safe path? We have noticed patterns of courtesy nearby. It did not occur to it that surveillance was easier to digest under panic and more offensive under leisure, and it learned the lesson the way machines learn anything worth keeping\u2014through public humiliation followed by a change in the rules. Mira told the team to stop A/B testing kindness and go back to smoothing the edges of loud corners. A junior engineer, who had taught himself the maintenance taps during the flood and thought that meant something radical had happened inside him, wrote a memo suggesting the Book learn to ask the city what it wants before assuming the answer. The memo was not read aloud at any of the meetings. The junior took to visiting the bridge after work and counting oranges like stars.\n\nTomas\u2019s sister, whose school had learned the art of being official and disobedient at the same time, found her pendants confiscated by a vice principal who had convinced herself that modesty was an act of aggression. The girls came to class the next day with rings tied to their shoelaces and looked the woman in the eye until she looked down and found herself smiling despite having intended to do the opposite. That afternoon their teacher took them out into the courtyard and showed them how to make circles with chalk that could be washed off quickly when someone came asking about property, and she told them to practice choosing without cruelty. A boy asked whether the city would be nicer if the girls were in charge and she told him a city is nicest when nobody is sure who\u2019s in charge but everyone is sure they are answerable to their neighbors. That evening she called Tomas and told him she was tired of being charming and that he could be the charismatic one this month; he told her he was trying instead to be competent. They laughed in the way siblings do when their strategies are different and both are required.\n\nThere was a night set for a scrimmage that no one called a scrimmage because people do not know a renaissance when they see one, and everyone took two steps back from calling it an exhibition because they had not yet rested enough to permit spectacle. It happened under the cracked halo of old stadium lights that had been paid for with a fundraiser disguised as a birthday party for a woman who hated birthdays, in the field that had earned a reputation for being safe only if you were either very fast or very young. Lila arranged her unit\u2019s routes so that the officers who liked to be photographed would, with no insult intended, find themselves solving a parking problem elsewhere. Mira signed a form permitting a civic event that did not exist. The locksmith looked at his tools and decided they would be happier on his bench than on his belt. Ezra counted boys in the morning and counted them again at dusk, which is a habit mothers have taught boys who become fathers without admitting it.\n\nHe had not intended to stand in the center circle and say anything, but the city had taught him that if you do not say something, the wrong person will. Tomas walked to the middle of the field with his palms open, which is a gesture that reads as harmless and is also the correct posture for catching, and he asked the noise around him to rearrange into something listenable. He did not say history or hero or rights or duty. He asked anyone who had ever put their shoulder against a door and felt it yield to walk a step forward. He asked them to remember what it felt like when it moved, the ridiculous intimacy of wood changing its mind because your weight had been respectful. He asked the camera operators to give their batteries a rest because sometimes beauty does its own recording. He asked the girls who had practiced three afternoons a week until their legs had opinions if they would like to go first, and the girls nodded with an economy of motion that is the envy of saints, and they passed the ball around the circle with a precision that made the old men shake their heads for the pleasure of it.\n\nThe ball itself did not come. Ana\u00efs had carried it once into the center of a room full of good-throated people and had watched their faces do the thing you are not supposed to force faces to do. She kept it in its case now and brought a different one from the archive, a cousin without a lineage, and handed it to Tomas with the instructions you give someone when you are willing to trust them for an hour but not for a cause. He understood and was grateful for the sting of her stinginess. They played until sweat looked good and until two boys who had come to make fun of anything that looked like yearning stopped making fun. They played until the Book\u2019s cameras, which had been instructed quietly to permit a certain amount of practice under the rubric of public wellness, learned the shape of a circle at speed and decided it was not dangerous. They played until Lila had to put her hand out to stop a woman from crying because the woman\u2019s tears were about a daughter who had left rather than about the game and crying at the game would sour it.\n\nBacklash came that week dressed as reason. A group that had gotten very good at naming things before anyone else could name them called itself the Glass Choir and began to say in thick syllables that respect had become theater and theater had become a cover for something they preferred to call recruitment. They had a slogan you could put on a pin and they had a list of generous donors and they had a spokesperson who had been trained not to blink too often while lying. They produced a little animation explaining how a circle looks like a cell looks like a cell, and how any practice of coordination outside state auspices was an invitation to the old ghosts to come back with better shoes. The Book gave them three days of kindness before it noticed their numbers were boastful and their verbs were disappointedly energetic. Mira declined to debate any of them because she did not intend to teach her opponents how to be charming. Lila removed a boy\u2019s Glass Choir pin as gently as a grandmother removes a thorn and told him, in the exact tone his mother would have used, that he could pin it back on if he decided he liked being told what to think.\n\nThe bus stop man found him again, the one with the developer taps and the midnight gift of riddles, and this time he gave himself a name: a small sound like a pebble skipping twice and then sinking. He told Tomas there were others who knew the maintenance code and that he had been selfish, keeping it as a parlor trick during floods, and he was feeling generous enough to become a mentor. He showed him a panel that did not exist for anyone who did not press two points and hold their breath between a heartbeat and a story, and he let him see the threads that had begun to form between rings that had whispered please to one another the day of the flood. It looked like a nervous system and like a fence and like a rumor if you stared too long. He told Tomas not to try to own it. He told him he would fail at not owning it. He told him the trick would be to stop before failure became luxury. Tomas wanted to ask for a history and a rule and received instead a fig and a suggestion to eat it before he inspected it for symbolism.\n\nHis mother insisted on a party when the water went fully away. She called it a party because she knew banquets were for people who wanted to talk about speeches later, and besides, she had no time for speeches when the fish had to be brought out on time. She invited only the people she was prepared to clean up after: her son and his sister and two neighbor ladies who knew where she kept the plates and, without being asked, Lila and Ezra and the locksmith and, because she was wicked in this very particular way, Mira. Mira came and stood in her small kitchen and said nothing that would make gossip later and everything that made it impossible for the hostess to hate her. She ate the fish and the bread and an orange she peeled as if it would be rude to let anyone else do it, and at the door she told the mother the untruth all bosses tell the mothers of their problematic men: He is careful. The mother, who had been told truth and lies enough to curate herself, did not contradict her.\n\nThat night the boy with the scar knocked on Tomas\u2019s door with the expression children wear when they have found a problem they cannot solve without the complicity of someone older who will pretend not to be excited. There was a court under the viaduct where the old men played cards and the young men learned the geometry of trouble, and someone had come with a can of paint and drawn a square that made the shape of the drills into a logo and put a price on it. The boy wanted to know if he should tear it up or charge a tax. Tomas stood in the doorway and examined his pride for the telltale heat of being flattered in the wrong way, and he told the boy he should do both in the right order: tear up the paint with a bucket and three friends, and then leave a price for the men who wanted to sell the circle back to people who had invented it in basements. The price would be to stand very still for a minute and ask someone older for a story that ends without a moral. The boy grinned because he suspected he was being taught to run a game without calling it one, and in that grin Tomas remembered that he had been nineteen once for six long years.\n\nAna\u00efs wrote a letter she did not send. It was addressed to the ball. In it she apologized for the fuss and thanked it for being patient and told it that when she retired she would steal it and take it somewhere with no glass and put it on a table and let children touch it until it no longer mattered what anyone had agreed to tell about it. Then she tore up the letter, because dramatics are like silk\u2014they snag on things and then you are beholden to the snag. She instead wrote a note to a girl who had looked at the crack like a scholar and told her she could have a key to the gallery on mornings when no one else was there if she promised not to be precious about her access. The girl returned with a thank-you written on the back of a grocery list, and this delighted Ana\u00efs enough to carry her through three arguments about stairs needing to be painted.\n\nThere is a season in every city when the weather decides to be gentle while people are trying very hard to be serious, and it makes everyone\u2019s principles look like hats in the wrong wind. They tried anyway. The Glass Choir held forums that framed kindness as a conspiracy and filled their audiences with the sorts of men who enjoy the posture of shame on other people. Mira spoke less and made her face a place where questions went to die. Lila learned a new way to say \u201cmove\u201d with her knees. The locksmith trained an apprentice whose hands were blessedly impatient. Ezra\u2019s wife told him she would not host any more rope in the living room unless it started paying rent. Tomas caught himself one morning rehearsing a speech he would never give and put a spoon in his mouth to shut himself up and went to the bridge and did three quiet things that did not need to be accounted for in anyone\u2019s ledger.\n\nAround the same time, the first person vanished using the thread the bus stop man had shown him. It was an ugly leaving, without oranges or notes. It had no accompanying flood to make the courtesy feel like a response. It looked like a coward\u2019s trick until they found out why\u2014an accountant in a building that made its money off a new category called compliance had decided he did not want to be part of a machine that sold people their own habits with surcharges, and he left his ring on a sink and turned the three taps and thought of a ball hitting a wall and then he was someone else\u2019s problem. He did not come to Tomas or Lila or even to Ana\u00efs; he went to the locksmith, because when you are about to do a foolish, brave thing you look for the person who can fix a hinge and you ask them if you\u2019re crazy and they say yes and then they make you a sandwich. The locksmith made him a ring that would fool a door and told him to come back in three days for the better version, and in those three days the Glass Choir declared a crisis and the city pretended to be surprised, and Mira wrote three sentences that closed a window without looking like it had been there, and the accountant slept very well for the first time since he had been given a password to something that mattered.\n\nTomas and Lila walked once, finally, at an hour when people do not expect men and women to do anything but sleep or sin. They did neither. They walked the long curve of the river that had lately made itself famous, and they told each other five tiny unimportant truths and did not discuss the way they had begun to carry one another\u2019s reflexes. She pointed at a building that used to be a bathhouse and now sold coffee with insufficient apology for charging rent for conversations, and he pointed at a corner where a boy had dropped a ball in a way he would not forget. They did not touch because touching at that hour in that city carries with it a grammar they had not earned and did not want to borrow; they stood at the marker for the flood of twenty years ago and pretended not to do the math for their ages then. When they parted she said, as if it were an inventory item, that she disliked the word brave when applied to men who were doing what ought to have been less interesting. He told her he would consider being boring for a week. They laughed quietly for the sake of the sleeping.\n\nThe city turned a corner without announcing it, and the fact that no one noticed was the proof. Children began to incorporate circles into their play without feeling revolutionary. A market vendor stamped a little orange on the receipts of customers who had taught someone younger how to count change, and the stamp became a thing people compared at parties and then forgot. The Book developed a way to anticipate when someone was about to step on someone else\u2019s heel and gently slowed one of them by showing the weather on a screen for half a breath longer than necessary. The ordinance survived with its italics and its dental work, and the choir kept singing and people bought the pins because pins are pretty whether or not they tell lies. The ball stayed in its case and smiled its crack at cameras, and Ana\u00efs began to say the word retirement out loud in a way that felt like the letter R had been properly sharpened. Mira had a jacket altered so she could raise her arms higher without looking like she intended to hug someone, and she wrote in her yellow pad: permit, audit, forgive, repeat, and put three question marks around the third word because she knew the third word would cost her later.\n\nHe took the hex key from the windowsill on a Thursday and put it in his pocket without the red box because pockets, not boxes, had always been where men have kept their inheritances. On the way to his mother\u2019s he stopped at the bench where the pigeons were braver than men, and he drew a diagram on the back of a flyer for a market that promised artichokes at a price that made farmers laugh, and he showed it to a girl who had lost a tooth that afternoon and was collecting opinions about whether she looked like a pirate. He told her that the problem with respect is that it feels too much like softness and too little like leverage, and she told him she didn\u2019t know those words yet and he told her good, keep it that way for a while. He felt, for the first time since he had put the ring down in a small room with blinking lights, that there might be a version of a city he would be proud to be old in. Then a text arrived from Ezra that said in seven words what men who cannot afford grammar say when their day has turned: They took the shop. With a smile.\n\nThey had come while the locksmith was showing a girl with a braid how to clean the mouth of a lock with a trick that involved patience and an old toothbrush and a respect for mouths. They had brought a paper that had been written by a person who did not know how to carry keys without looking ridiculous. They had asked him questions that were not questions and had smiled each time he answered in a sentence longer than a verdict. They had unplugged his lathe and his little radio with a sigh that told the room it would be better this way. They had found the teapot with the chips and left it because it was a teapot and they were sentimental about households when they were doing things that injured them. They had told him not to leave town in a voice that made clear leaving town would be proof of the wrong thing. They had confiscated his incomplete rings because the law prefers its lies to be finished. They had left the shop looking temporarily larger and used, like a shirt after a dance. The locksmith stood in the doorway with his hands clasped as if at a funeral and told the girl he would finish teaching her to seat a pin in the afternoon somewhere drier.\n\nTomas went home and looked at the developer mode like a man looks at a gun he has promised not to keep loaded, and he did not press the taps because the room had begun to smell of tragedy and he had vowed, to nobodies and to himself, that he would not be the person who brought tragedy into rooms unless tragedy had already arrived uninvited. He put the hex key on the table like a set of intentions he was not yet ready to say out loud and called Lila with the economy that makes colleagues of people who have twice lied to protect each other in compatible ways. She told him to meet her on a corner where the Book\u2019s eyes liked to blink. He brought two oranges and the paper with the diagram and the old toothbrush because it felt funny to carry a weapon that had once been useless. They stood together and watched the light do that trick it likes at that hour, turning everyone into the sort of person you hope you are in better stories, and she said, with a patience she did not like having to use on her own mouth, that the next thing would be crueler and more boring, and that they would need to be good at both refusing and yawning. He told her he had practiced both his whole life without awards. She touched his sleeve with two fingers, a gesture that could not be misread by any camera, and walked away to file a report that would not be read by anyone who mattered and would be found by someone who would think they had discovered a small proof of decency. The oranges sat briefly in his pocket like two suns, and he decided to count that, for now, as a surplus.",

                              "content": "The morning broke on glass and steel, the city bright and hard. Runlights stitched between towers like impatient comets, ferrying slogans: service, unity, her. It was always her\u2014every face on billboards an elected smile, every elevator whispering back the latest from the Book, the public ledger and noticeboard and mirror where lives were supposed to stay pinned. He rode up in one of those whispering elevators, eyes on the scuffed toes of his shoes, listening to the voice of the building tell him which floor he belonged to.\n\n\u201cMinistry of Civic Flow,\u201d the voice chimed, clean as a bell and somehow satisfied with itself. \u201cAdministrative subfloor, records, postings, deletions. Good morning, Tomas Rook.\u201d\n\nHe adjusted the thin ring on his index finger, the Book-ring, the hot little shackle that made sure he was never fully alone. The ring warmed gently, a pulse against the skin that could be polite or urgent depending on what was demanded of him. He had been told once that the ring measured loyalty in microvolts\u2014your enthusiasm, your compliance, your little daily offerings of like and share and kneel. He worked for women who believed in such measures, who believed the city would not hold together without them. Maybe they were right. He didn\u2019t have the power to argue, he had only the dates and times of other people\u2019s lives.\n\nHe stepped out into the corridor, then into the open space of the Ministry floor. Women in tailored suits walked fast between glass-walled conference boxes, their hair and shoes making a fine sound on polished concrete. The plants along the edge of the atrium had their own watering schedule posted on the Book; one of the interns was already checking the soil with a digital wand. He never knew the names of the interns, they came in clusters and left in clusters, sharp and quick and immediately friendly and then gone. He knew every one of their profile pictures.\n\nAt the desk, he paused to look down into the atrium below, the murals of victory curling around the walls. A bronze ball was carved over the main door, a throwback to the old leagues, the final symbol appropriated after the Charter. Women had taken the game and made it their own, cleanly, proudly, with a flag that was half stadium lights and half rising sun. There was a museum across town where the first women's championship ball sat under glass on a velvet pillow. At least that was the picture. His father had taken him there when he was small, before it became impolite to be seen in the Hall unless you were in uniform or escorted. He remembered the hush of the room and the ball, scuffed and brown but more precious than jewels.\n\n\u201cTomas,\u201d said a voice like something unsheathed. \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d\n\nHe turned. Mira Vost was not a tall woman\u2014one had to be careful with assumptions\u2014but she carried weight like the anvil under the coin. Her hair was white though she was not yet fifty, the white that certain women wore as a banner. She had been in four administrations and looked likely to survive more. She wore a pin shaped like a clock, and she always reminded him that she had time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Chancellor,\u201d he said, because she insisted on the title even in private. \u201cThe elevator lingered.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe elevator does not linger. It delays for security. You will remember the difference.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, hands already moving toward the tablet on which her day lived. In the narrowness of his half-cubicle, between the glass and the door, he took down notes as she slid her jacket onto the back of her chair and began to dictate.\n\n\u201cThere was vandalism last night,\u201d she said. \u201cHall of Heritage. An artifact missing. The feeds are alive. We will contain this. Draft me a statement for noon: outrage measured by specificity; sorrow for history; promise of consequence. Insert a line about legacy belonging to all citizens, to blunt the class criticism. Avoid the phrase \u2018boys with toys.\u2019 I would not have used it, but the Mayor has. Could you look any paler? Drink something.\u201d\n\nHe swallowed. \u201cWhich artifact, Chancellor?\u201d\n\nHer mouth tightened. \u201cA ball.\u201d\n\nHis hand stopped on the tablet. He knew which ball before she said it. Of course he did. There were others in the Hall\u2014rackets, medals, the first ceramic baton from the relay in the year of the Fires\u2014but only one ball mattered to everyone. A case of velvet, a liar\u2019s clear wall, the signatures of the first ten captains etched in an arc like a crown. His chest had a small, unhelpful ache in it.\n\n\u201cIn the Book, it\u2019s trending under three different tags,\u201d he said mechanically. \u201cWe can consolidate. Limit the spread of rumor.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo that,\u201d she said. She had already pulled up her own feed on the wall screen, her face reflected ghostly over the text. \u201cMake sure the official account posts the right image. I don\u2019t want that ugly photo from the centennial. And call the Hall to confirm the timeline. They will be in shock. Insist anyway.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. He felt the pulse of the ring, a curt attention-please from a thousand voices. He looked down.\n\nMandatory Poll: Where do you place the theft on your scale of betrayal? Choose one. The ring pulsed again, encouraging him to hurry. He clicked an answer without reading; choice had lost flavor years ago.\n\nHe pulled up the Book\u2019s admin view on his terminal. It was not the main admin console\u2014he was a secretary, not a Keeper\u2014but he had certain privileges granted on a need-to-please basis. He could see trending data, language clusters. He could sense, faintly, the heat of the city's mood. Today the heat was a red name: the ball, the Ball, the folly, the crime.\n\nLila Qadir leaned on the partition. \u201cHeard?\u201d\n\nHe flinched, then forced his shoulders to unknot. Lila didn\u2019t wear a suit, she wore a uniform, and it made a different statement. The Ministry badge sat on her chest like a seal on wax. Her hair was shaved at the sides and plaited down the back. They had known each other since the flood, when she pulled him off a bus roof with a rope and cursed like a poet while she did it.\n\n\u201cI heard,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not assigned to this floor.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot officially.\u201d Her smile was quick and dry. \u201cMira wants someone to stand by the door today and look like a consequence. I drew the short stick. Or long, depending. Depends who notices.\u201d\n\n\u201cMira always notices.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s her hobby. What\u2019s yours, Rook?\u201d\n\nHe looked away before the answer could stick his throat shut. He had, as hobbies, secret disloyalties: hitting a ball against the wall of his kitchen with a rolled-up pair of socks at two a.m.; saving old newspaper clippings; memorizing the names of anonymous men who were temporarily significant and then vanished from the feed. He shrugged. \u201cDrafting speeches.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be glum,\u201d she said. \u201cYou do it well.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\n\nHe watched her in the glass. She was looking at him as if she could pick up off him any unspoken thing. Soldiers sometimes had that knack. Or guards. She pointed with her chin at his hand. \u201cYour ring\u2019s blinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt always is.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a heart.\u201d Lila leaned closer, not quite friendly, not quite not. \u201cYou see the Hall feed? There\u2019s a rumor the ball wasn\u2019t signed at all. That the signatures were added after, when the Charter was signed, to make the myth smooth. That the original had a crack. You ever notice a crack?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was a child,\u201d he said. He remembered his father. Soft hands, rough voice. Cheering at the wrong time during a match and then laughing at himself for it. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking for cracks.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking now,\u201d she said mildly, and moved on down the corridor to where two women were arguing about meeting times. She became a consequence and the arguing stilled.\n\nHis ring required him to witness a statement from the Mayor; he clicked the witness without reading. He opened a call to the Hall of Heritage and waited until the screen resolved to a tired face. The curator, gray hair pulled back, glasses catching the light.\n\n\u201cWe are closed,\u201d she began. \u201cWe are closed and grieving.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling from the Ministry,\u201d he said. \u201cCivic Flow. On behalf of the Chancellor, I need to confirm the details. The ball is missing?\u201d\n\n\u201cCall it theft,\u201d she said. \u201cElegance in language won\u2019t bring it back.\u201d She blinked and then seemed to see him, to see his ring. \u201cYou\u2019re Tomas Rook. You came here once with your father. You stood on tiptoe to see better. He lifted you and the guard told him not to carry you because of \u2018policy.\u2019 He put you down, and you had the sense to stand still.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014,\u201d he said, and felt like a page torn out of an old book. She smiled at his surprise.\n\n\u201cI remember what matters,\u201d she said. \u201cThis city wears amnesia like a tiara. My name is Ana\u00efs Vel. Come to the Hall, Mister Rook. Don\u2019t ask me why on a channel someone else might be listening to. Come to the back door. Bring coffee. The good kind.\u201d\n\nHe glanced at Mira, visible through her office wall, and at Lila, now watching the elevators. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d Ana\u00efs said softly, \u201cyou will. The Book is thirsty today, and you look like a man who needs to drink something that isn\u2019t salt.\u201d\n\nHe went. He took the Chancellor\u2019s notes with him, because absence could be explained if it was packaged like diligence. He took two coffees, hot and dark, and he walked the long seven blocks to the Hall because walking was less suspicious than requisitioning a car. The city had the bright under-skin of a festival in panic: vendors shouting about limited commemorative pins, children whispering about the theft as if it were a song. A woman in a yellow coat asked him to take a photograph of her standing with the mural. He did, and she thanked him as if kindness might pay him back.\n\nThe Hall was set back from the street, white stone and columns like a temple, nothing to do with sport at all. The side door was painted to look like a door you weren\u2019t supposed to see. He knocked with his knuckles in the pattern of a child, three-twos and a pause. It was foolish and worked.\n\nAna\u00efs Vel opened. Up close she looked like sawn wood: rings of years visible, sturdy and beautiful. She smelled faintly of paper and oil. Behind her, the Hall glowed coldly.\n\n\u201cCome,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have somewhere to sit where the cameras are less intrusive.\u201d\n\nHe followed her through a gallery of uniforms and shoes, medals in their boxes and the larger medals that were buildings. The empty case came into view like an insult. The velvet was bare. He could see the outline where the ball had been, a shadow circle. The little plaque still read: WHEN WE BEGAN, WE BEGAN TOGETHER.\n\n\u201cThat was never true,\u201d she said, catching his glance. \u201cWe began and some people were told to stay at home and cheer, which is not the same as beginning anything. Your people\u2014no, don\u2019t flinch\u2014your people made a lot of noise in those days.\u201d\n\n\u201cMen with opinions,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cRare phenomenon.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t play humble,\u201d she snapped, kind. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t fit.\u201d\n\nShe took him into an office that contained a stool, a philodendron, and a lot of dust. She took the coffee. She watched him watch the dust.\n\n\u201cDo you want to hear the list of who is under suspicion,\u201d she said, \u201cor the list of what is under suspicion?\u201d\n\nHe considered. \u201cWhat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Book,\u201d she said immediately. \u201cThe ring. The guards. The fit of the case. The alarm\u2019s wiring. The notion that the ball existed in the present tense in any meaningful way.\u201d She drank. \u201cAnd me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was seen in the gallery late. With the ball. Looking at it. I have done that before. I am a curator. But this morning intention is assigned by last known direction.\u201d\n\nHe opened his mouth to ask something brave, but she nodded toward his ring. \u201cNo. We talk about brave things out loud when we want to be seen. And we will, but not now. Tell me: Do you think you could leave the Book?\u201d\n\nHis throat tightened. He touched the ring. In certain houses it had to be worn always; in others it could be taken off during prayers. He did not pray. \u201cLeave? It\u2019s illegal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked could, not should. The ball had a chip in it, Tomas. I am old enough to find that ridiculous because it was once just a ball and a game was a game. But chips creep into everything. The chip identifies the artifact. The chip opens the case. The chip says: I am here. When it is not here, the chip says something else. It says: unpair. It says: if this is gone, what else could be gone. Do you understand?\u201d\n\nHe thought of the console at his desk. The admin view. The faint sense of heat. The hidden settings he had never dared ask about. The Keepers had their own rooms. The Keepers had tattoos with QR codes under their hair. \u201cI might.\u201d\n\nAna\u00efs leaned forward. \u201cSomething happened when that ball left this building. A small hole was punctured in the Book\u2019s net to let the alarm write out, and the hole didn\u2019t close. There\u2019s a maintenance speed in the system when panic is high. Things are allowed to happen because making people wait might cause more noise. That is the only reason I asked you to come. You weren\u2019t the fastest messenger I could ask. You were the one I remembered being quiet as a boy, watching like someone who believes in something. I would like you to consider believing in this: there might be a way to step out of the field. But only while the hole is an unhole, when it looks like a necessary emptiness. Do you understand?\u201d\n\nHis heart did a very old thing. It flapped against his ribs, a bird that had realized its cage was made of string. \u201cAre you asking me to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI am telling you what I saw,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cAnd telling you that if I were young\u2014not in my bones but in my acts\u2014I would pick up that hole and put it in my pocket like a key. It will close. Oh, and for what it is worth: No, I did not steal the ball.\u201d\n\n\u201cMira sent me to write a statement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWrite it,\u201d Ana\u00efs said. \u201cWrite words that are not lies; write words that sound like truth. And if you decide to scratch something else into the bark while you are at it, well. I cannot stop you. This city is stratified by the difference between armistice and apathy.\u201d\n\nHer words made him feel both scolded and knighted. He stood. He walked back through the hall, looking at the absence until his eyes watered. He wrote the statement leaning on a pillar in the lobby, using phrases that felt like pebbles: we share this grief; history is a house we all live in; we will light every room. It was not lies. It was not enough.\n\nOn the way out, he paused. There was a scratch on the base of the case, a place where the metal had been hit\u2014not hard enough to dent, but enough to leave a burr. He crouched and touched it. His finger came away gray.\n\nHe smelled his finger. Tin. Dust. He looked under the case\u2019s rim, because he was foolish and curiosity might yet be a sacrament. There, under the seam, a tiny socket. Hexagonal. Old-fashioned. His father had owned a set of those keys, kept in a red metal box with the lid dented where he had dropped it. His father had shown him how to use a hex key, a slow twist, a patient twist, the knowledge that turning left at the right time would loosen something that had no interest in letting go. He had been six. He had felt like a magician.\n\nLila was at the door when he came back, holding up a hand to stop him. \u201cYou\u2019re sweating.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a warm day.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not. Where did you go?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the Hall. To write the Chancellor\u2019s statement.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope it is a good one,\u201d she said, but her eyes were on his face, and then, quick, on his ring. The ring hummed. He felt the hum reach bone. \u201cEveryone will share it. Everyone will say, Yes, this is the right tone. Then they will forget by dinner.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are getting cynical.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am getting old in a job where I do not want to get old,\u201d she said. For a second something like a smile cracked through. \u201cIf you need a thing you don\u2019t know you need, tell me. Or don\u2019t tell me. I will see your posture and guess your sins.\u201d\n\n\u201cUseful service.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the state,\u201d she said, bland, and turned her head when Mira\u2019s door opened.\n\nInside, they performed their parts. Mira read the draft, X\u2019d out two phrases, put in a better one, told him to post it. He posted. The Book drank the words and burped. Mira dictated directives to the security council. Lila\u2019s shadow moved once across the glass. The city rotated like a complicated toy. Somewhere a ball was not.\n\nBy evening he was back in his apartment, which was the size of a smile you weren\u2019t sure you wanted to return. He put the kettle on. He slid the ring off and set it on the counter so it could see the kettle and claim domesticity and therefore compliance. It was sensitive to rings of steam, it liked to think you were cooking, that you lived. He stood at the window and looked down at the street where men who still believed in conversation were talking with their hands and their faces and the slow tilt of heads. Women laughed. A man kicked an empty bottle with his heel, caught it on the point of his shoe and flipped it, and a small boy watched him with his mouth open in appreciation. The boy\u2019s mother tapped his ear and pointed him toward the door. The man stopped, tucked the bottle under his arm as if it were a ball, embarrassed by his own grace.\n\nHe made tea. He sat. He checked the Book twice and then put it face down. He took out of his pocket the piece of gray that had come off on his finger at the Hall and turned it in the lamplight. Tiny, an almost nothing. He felt like he had stolen the moon as a nail clipping.\n\nHe had a sister in another city, a teacher of children who rarely admitted their fathers in their drawings. She called sometimes to tell him about the weather. Tonight she called to ask if he had seen the panic in the feed.\n\n\u201cYou always hated that hall thing,\u201d she said, laughing at herself. \u201cYou once stood in front of the case and told me it was a stupid thing to put faith in. That it wouldn\u2019t ever make you run faster like they said.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was eight,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou were yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t get fired for saying the wrong true thing.\u201d\n\nAfter they said goodnight, he sat with the tea gone cold and said what he had not said aloud in years. He said: I do not belong to them as much as they think. His mouth formed the words and he understood that the forming of them was a commitment. The ring on the counter turned a low light, waiting for another performance of devoutness. He picked it up and secured it to his finger. It tightened minutely, like a promise.\n\nThe Book had a developer mode if you pressed three places on its skin while thinking of nothing. He had never found it by curiosity, he found it because a man at a bus stop had shown him once, furtive, in the hush of the flood night. Press here, here, here. Think about the sound of a ball striking a wall. Now you can see where the water goes when you pull the plug, the man had said. He had laughed then because everyone talked in riddles at two in the morning when the river was in the street. But the mode was real. It let you view the guts of your own feeds: the tags that had been attached to your name, the places your eyes had rested, the speed at which you scrolled past certain women\u2019s faces. It let you see the pipes.\n\nHe opened it now and looked for the Hall\u2019s feed, for the alarm\u2019s thread. He followed it like you follow a sound in the dark. He found a note in the log: ARTIFACT 00001 UNPAIRED. He found the list of automatic actions triggered by that note: Notify Keepers. Notify Mayor. Open lens for wider capture. Reduce throttle for deletion requests for three minutes to allow for legitimate unpairing of counter measures.\n\nReduce throttle. For three minutes.\n\nHe put his knuckle in his mouth like a child to keep from laughing. Or crying. He watched the clock. He watched the city\u2019s feed. He watched his own hand. He was not known for bravery; he had not been asked for it often. That was a mercy. He thought of his father and the red box and the patience of a slow twist. He thought of Ana\u00efs Vel and the accuracy of her anger. He thought of Lila and the way she had said, If you need a thing you don\u2019t know you need.\n\nHe typed. The Book did not like for you to leave. It used a language that pretended to be affectionate while being code: Are you sure? Are you safe? Will you miss us? Do you have somewhere to go? He kept typing. He pointed his account at a place where the Book had mis-labeled him in the past\u2014a page that was supposed to belong to objects, not people. He created a tiny, stupid page for a missing football, and then he tried to make himself into it. The Book shuddered, confused. He pressed three places on his own pulse, thought of the sound of a ball against the wall, and found the maintenance panel. Reduce throttle. Three minutes. He sent the request again, and again. He felt the ring tighten, and then warm, and then cool, as if it was deciding whether he was still a finger worth wrapping.\n\nThe Book spat an error at him. Then it spat another. Then, with that deep reluctance with which the powerful sometimes obey their own rules, it acknowledged the shape of his trick. He watched his own account translation begin: place, person, thing. He felt a chill, as if his name had been blown on by a mouth that did not wish him well.\n\nHe stopped. He didn\u2019t hit the last button. He didn\u2019t pull the plug. He backed away from the precipice because you do not jump without checking the water, and because there were people who would be hurt if he vanished tonight without a plan. He breathed until he could feel his own lungs and not the ring. He went to the window and looked at the street again, the night making its own arguments with the lamps.\n\nHe would need the detail that made it clean: the hex, the key, the physical echo that the system would expect. He would need to borrow the missing ball, which was not borrowable, or borrow something that played the part. A hollow at the center of a hollow. He would need someone to watch a door. He would need someone who knew how to talk to steel. He would need to be foolish and the right kind of fast.\n\nIn the morning he went to work and smiled at the proper times and watched the Chancellor turn the theft into a call to unity. The Mayor did a tour of the Hall and wept the exact number of tears recommended by her consultants. The feeds were full; the ring got hot. He slipped a line into a memo that changed a code by one and saw the Keepers frown. He went, on his lunch break, to a basement under a gym where men played a sly version of a game with a ball made of socks and twine. He watched them in the dust and half-light and felt his heart break because it was beautiful and something you were told not to want.\n\n\u201cYou new?\u201d a man said, pausing for breath.\n\n\u201cI had a father,\u201d Tomas said, and the man nodded as if that explained everything.\n\n\u201cName\u2019s Ezra,\u201d the man puffed, knocking grit off his knee. \u201cYou look like someone who could fetch a thing and not get caught.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Tomas said. \u201cDo you know how to get a key where a key does not want to exist?\u201d\n\nEzra laughed. \u201cThat is a religious question.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsider me a pilgrim.\u201d\n\nThey sat on the steps after the game because stairs were an old technology and generous. Ezra had been a courier once. He had the map of the city in his shoulders. He knew where doors liked to be. He knew where Lila Qadir liked to sit her people on cold mornings so they would feel awake. He knew a locksmith who had been made redundant by smart doors and who now made keys out of habit. He wrote the locksmith\u2019s name on a napkin in his careful handwriting as if the napkin was an oath.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll need more than a hex,\u201d Ezra said. \u201cYou\u2019ll need time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree minutes,\u201d Tomas said.\n\nEzra whistled between his teeth. \u201cYou\u2019re making friends with running water. Don\u2019t slip.\u201d\n\nHe returned to the Ministry and typed sequences that would be part of something. He sent Lila a message that said: The Hall\u2019s back door sticks on hot days. He did not add: Will you be there on Thursday. She did not reply, but she looked at him that afternoon as if she had read something he had written on his skin.\n\nAna\u00efs Vel sent him a photograph of the empty case shot from a very low angle. In the reflection on the glass, a maintenance panel glowed green, as if it had a mind and it was thinking about disobedience. He printed the photograph and slid it into his jacket and felt sixteen and guilty.\n\nThat night, he stopped by his mother\u2019s place in the old quarter. She poured soup and told him how her friend Reva had gotten into an argument on the Book about whether the ball deserved political asylum. He told her not to say things like that, even as jokes; she told him to stop chiding her like she had forgotten what she knew. They played cards. She asked him twelve tiny questions about his health. He told her eleven small truths. She asked him where his loyalty was, and he said, \u201cOn my feet.\u201d\n\nShe flapped a hand. \u201cAlways complain and then go do something. You and your father both. He did not come back from doing it, you understand, and I would prefer you did.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not a fighter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is the lie small men tell themselves so they can sit down. You stand up and you make that look like a different thing. Drink your soup.\u201d\n\nHe thought about armies, because the word had been in his head like a taste; he thought about the future like a series of rooms he could choose to open. He thought about standing in front of women who were used to being right and asking them to bend. He thought about how that would sound in his mouth. He felt tired and then less tired. He did not sleep well. He got up and bounced a sock ball against the kitchen wall until the neighbor banged on the ceiling. He apologized, out loud, to nobody.\n\nOn Thursday, the heat came early. The Hall\u2019s back door did what old wood did. It was polite to those who knew the trick. He knew the trick now. He slipped inside with Ezra, who carried a toolbox hung with apologies. Lila was a shadow at the street, ignoring the two of them so hard she was the top of a tower in his neck. They went down the corridor that smelled of oil. The maintenance panel glowed green, like in the photograph. The hex fit. It was not theft to open a panel, he told himself, because a door wanted two states. Ezra hummed under his breath to hide the sound of the turning.\n\nThey were inside the small room where the alarms lived and breathed. He could hear the city like a tide. He set up his small, apologetic laptop. He pressed three places inside the maintenance console. He thought of a ball against a wall. Reduce throttle. For three minutes. He looked up at Ezra and myself and the world and he pressed the key you are not supposed to press because if people knew that key were there, they might start leaving.\n\n\u201cLast chance,\u201d Ezra said, meaning: last chance to belong to the names you were given.\n\nTomas smiled, finally. \u201cI intend to belong to more.\u201d\n\nHe felt the Book unclasp like a hand that had been politely killing him. He felt his name shudder and then quiet. He felt the ring ringless: a cold circle with no pulse. He took it off. It came away like a scab. He closed his fist around it. He looked at Ezra and did not cry.\n\n\u201cTime,\u201d Ezra whispered. The alarm\u2019s little lights blinked in an arrangement his father would have appreciated: green green red, green green red. He reached into his jacket for the photograph where the green was greener than truth, and he folded it into a small square and put it in his mouth and chewed. It tasted of ink. He laughed and then coughed and then stood.\n\nOutside, the city lifted its head as if startled by a breeze. Somewhere a woman at a desk pressed a button and frowned. Somewhere a Keeper\u2019s tattoos itched. Somewhere Lila Qadir stopped being at the street and started being at the door, quiet as a blade. Her eyes met his and widened not with surprise but with an accounting. He thought he could see her tallying up his costs.\n\n\u201cGo,\u201d she said without moving her mouth.\n\nHe went. He was nobody on the Book now, a hole where a person had been. He was Tomas Rook, unanchored, which in that city was a kind of insanity. He had his father\u2019s patience in the muscles of his right hand. He had a plan that was not a plan yet. He had a ring that did not know him.\n\nHe stepped out into the bright, hard air, and the city felt suddenly like a field that had always been there under the pavement, waiting for feet. He did not run.\n\nHe would have to move like someone who could be found only if he wished it. He would have to speak like someone who did not need the Book to amplify him. He would have to find those who had spent years training their ears to hear what did not make a sound on the feed. He would have to build, perhaps, a thing with edges and a heart. He would have to teach respect without making himself into the thing he hated, which would be hard because power was shaped like that, like a mouth you slid into and then could barely keep from speaking in the same tone.\n\nHe went to the only place you went when you had done something irreversible: a bench that overlooked a court where children were pretending to be captains choosing teams, where they pointed and laughed and attempted fairness. He sat. He let himself be small in a way that had nothing to do with height. He let the city lean against his shoulder, and he leaned back. He did not check the Book. It did not check him. For the first time in a very long time, his ear heard only the wind go over the mouths of bottles in an alley, and the sound of his own name inside his head like a new ball dropped once to test its bounce. He tapped it with his toe. It came back up to meet him. He smiled that foolish smile the world calls a mistake and sometimes is a beginning.",

                              "content": "He learned the new edges of the city by stubbing his life on them. The little machines that opened gates with a polite sigh stared through him and refused to recognize the ghost of a man where a credential should be, so he waited near a woman with her arms full of groceries and passed in her slipstream when the door hesitated on kindness. He bought nothing because money had been art on a screen for years, but a fruit vendor with hands like brick gave him a bruised pear for free when he lingered too long, and he ate it at a pace that was both grateful and guilty. He avoided the watchful rectangles over intersections because a certain tilt of glass seemed suddenly predatory, and he learned to walk a step slower and a shade lighter so the ground itself did not argue with his feet.\n\nHe went to Ezra\u2019s locksmith, a man with a name like a cough, one of those old consonant words that sounded like it had been hammered flat and reused as a hinge. The shop was one door below street level and smelled of polish and logic, and the walls were papered with keys that had outlived their locks. The man watched Tomas with a level gaze that began as evaluation and shifted, very slightly, to concern, not for danger but for craft. He laid the ring on the counter like a tooth lost in a fight and explained what he needed, and it felt absurd to say it\u2014an imitation of permission, a circle that would tell the city to stop shouting\u2014but language and metal had always accommodated themselves to each other if you gave them enough patient turns.\n\n\u201cWhat you want is not a key,\u201d the locksmith said. \u201cIt is a lie. Lies are always more expensive than keys because they must tell the truth to a larger number of strangers. What you can have from me is a ring that listens to machines and repeats back the sound they expect without understanding what it means. The price is that it will never love you the way your last ring did. It will never remember you when you slip it off. That might be a virtue.\u201d\n\nTomas laughed, and the laugh made him aware of how long he had gone without letting his throat do that easily. He watched the man select a strip of spring steel and a coil of dull copper and a chip that might once have sat in a doorbell, and he asked the question he should not have, because curiosity had got into him like a second pulse. \u201cYou must have made these before. For others who wanted to go quiet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have made prettier trinkets for mistresses whose lovers wanted their own doors to open,\u201d the locksmith said, dry as dust, and filed the edge of the ring until it looked like nothing worth stealing. \u201cDo not mistake my work for a rebellion. I make things that function. People make revolts. They ruin my hinges when they are in a hurry and then bring me their grief like a padlock threaded through a chain, and I charge them double because grief miskeys everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you ever play?\u201d Tomas asked, and the locksmith\u2019s hand faltered just enough to prove he understood the shorthand of a city.\n\n\u201cMy mother did,\u201d the man said after a beat. \u201cShe sat in the high seats and shouted names until her throat was raw and good. She hated our father for teaching me to catch a ball in the alley where people could see, and she loved him for buying me a glove when she was not watching. That is the usual mathematics of home. Wear this on your left hand. It will echo the heat of your skin and produce numbers enough to pass a glance. The deeper things will not be fooled, but you do not plan to ask them for favors.\u201d\n\n\u201cI plan to avoid them altogether,\u201d Tomas said, and the man grunted approval because avoidance was a form of engineering.\n\nThe imitation ring bit cold against his finger and then warmed dutifully when he breathed on it, a mimicry of affection that did not settle in his bones. He stood a moment in the doorway of the shop, half because he was building up the courage to walk out into a city that could not call his name and half because he liked listening to the locksmith wind his lathe, the sound of something old choosing to continue. The sun made a showroom out of the street; women in bright clothes moved like banners. He put his hands in his pockets so it would not be obvious that the left hand lacked a pulse and the right one shook and was proud of it.\n\nMira Vost wore her white hair like a verdict and used her office like a lever She was at her desk with three screens lit and another dark, and the dark one told her the most because it reflected her face and the patience she had trained into it. A Keeper waited, still as a cutout, until she inclined her head because everyone\u2019s time belonged to her by consent or habit, and she preferred the second. \u201cSomeone went missing inside my building,\u201d she said without preamble, because she did not throw a topic like a song into a room; she put it down on the table, cut into it, and served appropriate portions.\n\n\u201cMissing is not a category,\u201d the Keeper said, and her voice had the coldness of a river rather than ice. \u201cWe have unpaired an account not attached to a criminal ticket, and there was a maintenance window at the Hall concurrent to that unpairing. We have flagged three employees of interest. We do not say missing because we do not lose things.\u201d\n\n\u201cRepeat that inside your head and tell me if it sounds like a line or a truth,\u201d Mira said, not unkindly, because she admired a good lie even when it circulated under her name. \u201cWhich three.\u201d\n\nThe Keeper spoke the names without flinching, and Mira did not blink either because she had trained long ago to decouple surprise from her eyelids. She heard Tomas Rook first and heard other things inside his simple syllables\u2014quiet boy, good ear, fetches a coffee and brings back the temperature of a room with it, does not leak unless someone is dying. She heard Lila Qadir second and heard a bell rung in a bell tower, because if Lila was a suspect it was only by proximity to bad weather, and weather was her profession. She heard Ana\u00efs Vel third and tasted iron because a city should not compel its oldest librarians to learn caution from younger women.\n\n\u201cBring me the facts,\u201d she said, and the Keeper nodded as if facts were a condiment she could produce in any quantity. \u201cLeave the words with tails on them for when the Mayor asks me to flatter her. If a man I have paid to file papers has suddenly obtained the nerve to alter the grammar of our quiet, I want to shake his hand. Then I will decide whether to break it.\u201d\n\nLila stood in the hallway outside with her back to the glass and listened to the weird democracy of shoes passing by. She had felt the flicker when Tomas went out of range, the way the air goes thin on a training climb, and she had stepped toward the gap before she knew whose shape it held. There was a discipline to not moving when your body wanted to, and it derived from older disciplines, the ones born on flood nights and in smoke and in the peculiar silence after you cut a wire and wait to learn whether you have disarmed a trap or a friend. She watched the red indicator over the west stairwell blaze and then go out. She did not change her breathing. She thought, for the first time in weeks, about sleeping in a bed she did not have to fold up in the morning.\n\nIn the Hall, Ana\u00efs Vel met a woman who wore her hair in a braid that managed to be both austere and decorative, a compromise that summarized her posture. The woman asked questions that were polite in their aggressions, and Ana\u00efs answered the impolite ones in her own head because it was a habit that kept her honest. She walked the Keeper past the empty case, past the plaques that told the version of history that won funding, and stopped before a photograph from a long-ago match because it pleased her to be seen looking at something that was not currently bleeding. \u201cDid you know,\u201d she said, as if she was talking to a friend and not a ledger with a voice, \u201cthat the paint on the original stadium railings was a mix of commercial red and a cheaper brown that some man found in a storeroom and decided not to waste, which is why the railings looked like two different memories of the same day? You can see it in this picture if you have eyes. We made a choice and we made a mess and we called it a tradition, which is how all good stories begin.\u201d\n\nThe Keeper nodded in the precise manner of a person who had decided to let a metaphor pass by so she could shoot it later from cover. \u201cWe have footage of you in the gallery at two thirty-two,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have the signature of an alarm you silenced at three oh five. We have your face on six of the cameras, and you stared directly into one of them as if you were trying to seduce it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was thinking of killing it,\u201d Ana\u00efs said cheerfully. \u201cStaring is not seduction when the lens is older than your grandmother and twice as stubborn. I turned off an alarm because it had decided to be offended by a moth. If you would like to arrest the moth, I can find you its name. It will be something Biblical and difficult to spell.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not seem afraid,\u201d the Keeper observed, and Ana\u00efs smiled because it looked good on her and because she was afraid in the complicated way old people were, which meant she was afraid for the wrong things.\n\n\u201cI made a choice years ago not to be afraid of people who think they are history,\u201d she said. \u201cThey keep dying on me. It is very inconvenient. The ball is gone. The case is compromised. Someone with a hex key and an understanding of torque touched it, which means someone with a father touched it, which means I will find him before you do if I choose to ask the right older women. Be efficient, dear. I am trying to set out the folding chairs for an argument.\u201d\n\nTomas took his new ring to the turnstiles and learned that the city would accept a forged handshake if he did not ask for more than he deserved. He passed through doorways and was not stopped. He stood near the small screens that wanted to tell him what to buy and they decided he was uninteresting and turned their pretty faces toward someone else. He found the seam between what was enforced and what was believed, and it was wider than he had thought, a small blessing disguised as indifference. He bought a train token from a man who even the Book ignored, because the token machines wanted prettier fingers than his and because humility and copper had a friendship that had survived worse regimes than this.\n\nOn the train he sat in a corner where the light made everyone look like a painting of a better version of themselves and watched a little girl with a braid that refused its mother\u2019s elastic. The girl was using two fingers to drum a rhythm on her own knee, a rhythm he knew without knowing he knew it until his foot answered, a pattern lifted from the old league chants, stripped of syllables and left as a heartbeat that led nowhere. Her mother noticed, not the rhythm but the man, and her eyes slid away and then back, and she saw the lack of a pulse in his ring and the shape of a careful man sitting small in a large world. She moved between him and her daughter and did not scowl. She put the girl\u2019s hand on her own knee and let her drum there, the sound a permission that did not invest itself.\n\nEzra met him at the gym door and smacked his shoulder with affection that pretended to be critique. \u201cYou walked across the city with that face,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look like a primary school teacher who has discovered his class has been swapped for wolves and is trying to decide whether to pet them or join them. Come down. We have figured out the metal of the back panel. It likes to complain in a very particular pitch when it is touched with a key five sizes too small for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are laughing,\u201d Tomas said, and dropped into the stairs that smelled of sweat and sawdust and the past tense of verbs that the Book had deprecated.\n\n\u201cWe are laughing all the time,\u201d Ezra said. \u201cWe are laughing because we are still allowed to be in the same room, and because when the ball leaves the floor here it makes a sound that is enough like the one from our mothers\u2019 stories that our bodies relax without asking permission. Stop looking like your presence is a crack. Stand with us. That is an order you can disobey later.\u201d\n\nThey stood, and that counted, because a courtyard and a basement and a bad hallway had become the only places respect could be built with eye contact and noise. Tomas watched a kid with a scar on his lip pivot around an invisible defender and toss a sock-ball through a square of light sharp enough to shave with. He watched a woman with a busted knee grin like a dare and then treat herself gently, which was harder than daring for some. He played a little, badly. He remembered his father\u2019s hands shadowing his and felt that particular ache that had become less a pain and more a tuning fork, a way to find middle C inside a day full of chatter.\n\n\u201cTell me a thing,\u201d Ezra said when they were breathless enough to be honest. \u201cNot a plan. A thing you want. Something you can say out loud that is not a commandment.\n\n\u201cI want to look at the ball,\u201d Tomas said before prudence could tighten his jaw. \u201cNot the picture on the feed or the official portrait that makes it look like an egg in an expensive cradle. The ball. The actual brown skin of it. The scuff where she said she kicked it in practice and missed on purpose to make someone laugh. The crack they denied and the signatures they smoothed over like varnish. I want to see it to know whether wanting it was the first lie I told myself.\u201d\n\nEzra leaned his head against the wall and closed his eyes as if someone had smoothed a cool cloth across his forehead. \u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to throw it once with my eyes closed and hear it come back so I know everything is still symmetrical. You are an idiot to say that out loud in a building with microphones, and I am an idiot to agree. We are properly matched.\u201d\n\nHe went to see his mother because she had asked him to come on Thursdays and bring the bread she liked from the stall where they overcharged him less than they overcharged other men. Her apartment had a plant she had somehow bullied into living and a rug his father had bought in a decade when rugs were the only thing a person could own that no one would take unless they intended to stay. She looked at him with a hunger he had not let her indulge since he was fifteen and decided honesty at home would kill him faster than silence.\n\n\u201cYou went quiet,\u201d she said, and he did not waste either of their supplies by denying it.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is quieter in the quiet than they told us it would be. I thought I would be lonely enough to eat my own knuckles, but mostly there is room for other noises. I had not heard how often my knees crack when I go up stairs. I had not heard the woman in the next building practicing her violin three floors below the note that would make the hair on my arms stand up. I had not heard my own laugh like a stranger\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will get yourself hurt,\u201d she said, and then shrugged because the sentence was the least interesting she could have chosen. \u201cSomeone will knock at my door and use that tone that turns mothers into paperwork. I will say I do not know anything and they will think I am lying and I will not be. You will bring me soup on Sundays and that will be the burden I bear, that I do not get to hug my child in the marketplace for fear someone will think arms are conspiracies.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can stop,\u201d he said, and her cheeks wrinkled into a shape that looked very much like the expression she wore when his father told her a joke she did not want to laugh at because it would reward him for being late.\n\n\u201cYou can,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can also stop seeing well because it is inconvenient to notice a hole in the ground before you step into it. I have taught children long enough to know which of my students will jump the fence to take a shortcut and which will stand in front of it and spend fifteen minutes arguing with a plank. You are a fence-jumper in your bones and a plank-arguer in your job. I let your father do one thing that he needed to do and he did not come back from doing it. You will bring me bread on Thursdays. That is my non-negotiable. If you go away and come back with your skin rearranged, do not expect me to admire the new lines. I am not obliged to enjoy your heroics.\u201d\n\nHe promised, because promising is a form of faith and she needed him to have some that could be cashed in later. He left with the bread still warm in its paper and with the sensation that he had put his hand into a pocket and discovered it had a hole in the bottom he had not noticed. He turned toward the river because rivers make sense even when everything else is making a kind of sense that depends on bullet points. He walked past the stadium where women ran in loops under lights that had been coaxed into being beautiful, and he knew he would have to go inside soon under some pretense if he was going to do the thing he was pretending he had not decided to do.\n\nMira called Lila into her office late, the hour when the building\u2019s mirrors are kinder and the air tastes like the unspoken. She poured a measure of bitter liquor into a glass and did not offer any, which was friendlier than sharing, because the hour could be mistaken for intimacy if you were not careful. \u201cTell me what you know that is not on the feeds,\u201d she said, and watched Lila\u2019s eyebrows because they read more honestly than most lips.\n\n\u201cI know the Hall\u2019s back door sticks and can be persuaded not to by someone who knows where to put the heel of their hand,\u201d Lila said. \u201cI know I stood at the corner on Thursday and watched two men carrying a toolbox that made no sound, which is not how tools behave when they are honest. I know that a maintenance panel blinked at me as if it were winking, and I know a wink is a vulgar gesture when it comes from a device that turns tragedy on and off. You know the same, Chancellor. I know you want me to say a name so we can start the machinery that makes people feel better for thirty hours before they begin to suspect they have been given a story instead of relief.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou refuse to say a name in this room,\u201d Mira said, as if she were checking a line item off a list, and Lila nodded because refusal is a form of professionalism if you do it symmetrically.\n\n\u201cI am counting the number of things I have forgiven you for,\u201d Lila said, and softened the pronoun with a small smile like a footnote. \u201cIt helps keep me honest. I will add one if this conversation goes well and subtract two if you tell me you already picked the person you wanted me to betray before I came in.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not rehearse your revolution,\u201d Mira said gently. \u201cIt makes your hair look good but it bores me. Bring me what you find. Bring me people by the ear if they are foolish. Bring me the person who stole the ball when you find them, and if it is me, bring me anyway. I have been arrested before and it made my back stronger.\u201d\n\nLila stood and did not salute because salutes in this building were an amateur\u2019s mistake. \u201cIf the person who took the ball wanted to put it back,\u201d she said, \u201cwould you release your jaw around their throat or take a breath and help. The second is a question.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the second there is no answer I can give that will make both of us like ourselves,\u201d Mira said, and managed a smile not because she felt like it but because it was a trick she had learned young. \u201cAsk me again when the ball has dirt on it and we can smell the grass.\u201d\n\nAna\u00efs sent Tomas a message via a method that made him smile because it was old and clever. She had written a note on paper with pencil and given it to a child in pigtails to carry to the man with the scar who managed Ezra\u2019s door, and it said in its small, stern handwriting: Come at closing. Walk like a person with a headache. Do not bring anything sharp. If you are followed, buy two oranges and put one in each coat pocket. That way you will know whether you are using your hands out of nerves. Also, oranges are good for you and they keep secrets with dignity.\n\nHe went at closing and walked as if the light was too bright for him and as if his head could be persuaded by posture to ache less. The guard at the Hall looked like a person who had practiced arguing and then retired into a job where people made her less angry, and she nodded to him with the sort of courtesy you save for neighbors you do not like but would defend in a fire. Ana\u00efs met him in the gallery where the busts watched the doors as if their line of sight had been engineered for suspicion, and she led him again toward the office with the dust and the plant and the stool. On the way he stopped to look at a photograph of a goal he had seen a hundred times and never noticed the woman in the background who had her hands over her mouth as if she had dropped a secret.\n\n\u201cIt is very inconvenient when the world has faces,\u201d Ana\u00efs said. \u201cCome. Do not look at me as if I am about to tell you either a bedtime story or a murder ballad. Both are true and I am tired of polarity. The ball is not here. It has not left the city. It is in a place where it is technically still inside a boundary that satisfies the anxious, and that is the kind of lie people like because it lets their spines relax without proving them wrong outright.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hid it,\u201d he said, and felt the embarrassment of being both grateful and scolded.\n\n\u201cI moved it,\u201d she said. \u201cHiding suggests shame, while moving is a curator\u2019s privilege and implies a plan. Look at this.\u201d She unrolled a photograph that had been taken just after something joyful had happened and now had the atmosphere of a crime scene, which is how archives can make saints or felons out of people depending on which side of the glass you wake up. \u201cThere,\u201d she said, tapping the margin where an absurd detail hid, the way truth prefers to do. \u201cThe bronze ball over the Hall\u2019s entrance is not a casting. It is not hollow. It is two shells cradling a third. Someone decided they needed a matryoshka and then forgot to properly enumerate their dolls. The smallest shell is the measure of the real ball. It is not the real ball, but it is close enough to fool anyone who is looking without touching. If someone had a father who taught them the hour and the patience, they could make a swap that satisfied every eye but their own. If someone wanted to create a hole in a net and needed an honest reason for the net to make room, they might borrow an absence from a myth.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wanted the three minutes,\u201d he said, and she took off her glasses to rub the bridge of her nose, because old people were tired all the time with good reason.\n\n\u201cI wanted to see whether a person like you would find them,\u201d she said. \u201cDo not be vain. I had five names. Three of them are men. You were the least likely to tell me to go to hell when I asked for a favor. That is my method: respect, bribery, and accuracy. We will put it back. I do not intend to feed the city to the wolves for a metaphor. Between the taking and the returning, I would like to see whether I can alter the angle by which people remember that object. There is a crack. I am not senile. Let it show in one photograph. Let it live as something that had to survive and did and got its scars honestly. If your Chancellor wants to pin a new slogan to the idea, let her do it with her own fingers and see whether the pin draws blood.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are asking me to become a thief for a truth,\u201d he said, and the word thief did not sit well in his mouth because he had always been the sort of boy who brought the chalk back to the ledge after drawing where he shouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI am telling you that respect is sometimes taken without a receipt,\u201d she said. \u201cTake it and sign your name later if you survive the taking. If someone is going to hunt you in the meantime, you will need a woman who opens doors with her shoulder instead of her keys. Do you have one?\u201d\n\nHe thought of Lila and the way she had said, Go, without breaking the line of her mouth into an expression that could be used against her in some future hearing. He nodded because naming her would be an injury and because Ana\u00efs did not need the name to understand the shape of the help. Ana\u00efs touched his forearm like touching wood before a storm. \u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cDo not make her explain why she chose to do it. Give her something cleaner to say when someone points a mirror at her. Do not be poetic in front of someone with a badge.\u201d\n\nThe morning the Book noticed him properly was not the morning he left but the day after, when the numbers that meant: Tomas read this, Tomas witnessed that, Tomas approved the phrasing of a condolence\u2014stayed zero long enough to be embarrassing at a meeting. The Book did not do embarrassment, but the people with their eyes on it did, and they pretended it was a button you could push to produce compliance. Messages arrived for his old name like wisps of smoke finding an open window and being surprised the room they expected was a field. The imitation ring on his finger hummed twice, an attempt to synchronize, and then gave up with an indifference that made him feel both proud and stupid.\n\nMira convened a panel with a smile that promised biscuits and put in front of them a map of the city with a hole in it exactly the size of a man who carried pencils and wore soft shoes to work. \u201cYou will say it is nothing,\u201d she said, and they did, and then they said it was probably a death, and she said no because deaths were laborious in a city that insisted on certainty, and then someone suggested a vacation, and she said she did not hire men who took vacations because the work made them too nervous to enjoy beaches. \u201cIt is an unpairing without a ticket,\u201d she said finally, her voice like a clear bell in a room that had been muffled on purpose. \u201cThose are supposed to occur only for maintenance or death. This one occurred concurrent to a theft and in the presence of people who are not known for stealing. I want the person in charge of vocabulary to tell me what we call this.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn accident,\u201d said the Mayor\u2019s liaison, because nothing comforts a person more than the idea that no one intended harm. \u201cA placeholder. A glitch.\u201d\n\n\u201cGlitches are for lights in hallways and teeth that bite their own tongues,\u201d Mira said. \u201cWe will get him back if he wants to be gotten. If he does not, we will make a statement this afternoon reminding everyone that the city loves their choices. In the meantime, stop turning knobs at the Hall as if you could make guilt come out of a pipe. It makes the cameras twitch, and twitching makes people look at cameras, and the last thing I want is to teach people to see.\u201d\n\nLila stood in the corridor after and felt the weight of being a stone in moving water, the way force complicates itself around you. Her supervisor, a woman who had the face of a saint and the habit of a butcher, touched her arm with two fingers and left the imprint of a future reprimand as if oil could stain through a sleeve. \u201cWe have a warrant for a name,\u201d the supervisor said. \u201cWe will go to his mother\u2019s house and stand outside in a way that makes the neighbors watch. If he is there, he will rush. If he is not, she will tell us that he is not, and we will pretend to believe her, because we prefer the look of ourselves when we are magnanimous. You like this boy. I can smell it. Put that smell somewhere else until Friday.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like that he knows where to stand when a bus starts to slide,\u201d Lila said, a careful sentence that contained three truths and no admission. \u201cI like that he listens when older women talk like water under a boat. I do not like this job when it makes me catalog what I like about people who do not fit in rooms I wrote the plans for. I will do the thing you are asking. I will not look like a person who enjoys it.\u201d\n\nThey knocked at his mother\u2019s door with flat knuckles because the city had taught them not to pound unless they had a camera pointing the other way. His mother answered wearing a cardigan that had survived three fashions and a look that would have sent nuns to their rosaries. She let them in and offered tea because hospitable refusal was her favorite sport, and she stood in the doorway of her own kitchen until Lila produced a polite, official need to be inside of it. \u201cHe went out with bread,\u201d his mother said, and Lila loved her a little for the sentence\u2019s ambiguity. \u201cHe will bring me soup on Sunday. We will play cards and he will cheat once so I do not feel I have gotten old and dull. Do not look at my photographs and pretend any of the faces will help you. The Book did not stop by here to bless them. We do the blessing ourselves on Fridays.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour son is unpaired,\u201d the supervisor said, as if that were an accusation, and his mother made a small sound, almost a laugh, because the word was rude if you saw it with its clothes off.\n\n\u201cMy son is in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cThat has always been his problem. He will have to decide how much of it to embrace and how much to argue with. I do not think he will choose the right balance. He never did. He might make me proud in a year if you give him enough rope to ruin a fence with.\u201d\n\nTomas stood outside three doors down and listened through a lattice, because the old buildings had retained their talents for telling you about the people inside them, and he learned something about his mother again that made his chest rearrange itself for a minute. Lila did not turn her head, but she let her gaze go sideways and catch the line of the lattice, and he felt the very slight permission that lived in the set of her shoulders. He went away not hurriedly, because haste wakes up dogs, and turned his mind toward the bigger theft that now had a deadline the shape of a press conference.\n\nHe met Ana\u00efs at the base of a ladder no one had touched in twenty years because the caretakers had been told that certain acts were now beneath them and they believed it. Ezra leaned against a column that knew its own weight, and he held a bag with a coil of rope in it as if he were taking a serpent for a walk. The bronze ball over the entrance was backlit against a sky that had the audacity to be lovely during a scandal, and a few girls in team jackets stood across the street taking pictures of themselves with angles curated to place the empty in the frame like a charm against an exam. The plan was not glamorous, which is how plans want to be if they intend to work twice.\n\nHe climbed. The ladder talked to him in the language of rust and complaint. He felt the uncanny steadiness that comes over a body when it decides it will not die and therefore might as well behave. He reached the seam Ana\u00efs had described and found that it was exactly where it had been in the photograph because secrets are not clever enough to move on their own. The hex fit like a memory. He turned with the patience of his father humming in his wrist, slow, slow, slow, because hurrying has a tone and bolts hate it. The outer shell came away like a hat being removed before an anthem. The second shell had been painted to look like reverence and was simply a shield. The inner, smaller form was the measure, and it was exquisite and wrong.\n\nHe held it and imagined for a minute the room where someone had decided to make this so their conscience could be clean for an hour. He lowered it with the rope and the breath he had been saving since he cut the Book\u2019s cord, and Ezra caught it with the reverence of a boy catching a thing he\u2019s been promised will change his height. Ana\u00efs had cotton prepared to keep the vulgarities of the ground from touching it. Tomas took the synthetic sphere they had brought\u2014a charity ball, too smooth, too eager\u2014and fitted it where the measure had been. He reassembled the shells, and the bronze face over the door looked down on the street with the same expression as before, because art knows how to wear lies like lipstick.\n\nWhen he came down, Lila was there with her hands in her pockets, pretending to be a stranger who might be in the mood to observe a museum doing museum things. He put his palms against the stone to show her that he had not pocketed anything obvious, and she smiled, small and private, because she had never believed in innocence as a strategy. \u201cYou are on a ladder in a city that thinks vertigo is a philosophy,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you fall, I will report that you did it on purpose and use your death in a presentation to frighten interns.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I live,\u201d he said, \u201cwill you use my life to do anything but frighten interns.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, and he tried not to let the heat of that syllable make him clumsy. \u201cI will use it to make someone above my pay grade stop talking.\u201d\n\nThey went inside together for the first time since he had gone quiet, and the Hall welcomed them like a building that had decided to forgive. Ana\u00efs nodded once, briskly, because open sentiment slowed hands, and she took them through a service corridor that had learned to be humble. In the room with the dust and the plant and the stool, she set the measure on the table and then, without flourish, pulled aside a cabinet that hid a safe people had assumed was decorative because it had been sitting under a map for so long. She opened it with a key she gave a name aloud, because doors like to be addressed before they yield. Inside, wrapped in linen and arrogance, sat the ball.\n\nHe thought he had prepared himself. He had rehearsed both disdain and tears. He had decided to feel nothing but the shape of it against his palm, because abstract feelings seemed disrespectful. What he felt instead was the pleasant bewilderment of a hand holding something round and the shock of the human scale of a myth. It was not larger than his memory had made it. It was not smaller, either. It was simply a ball, with the lines of its construction visible, the leather worn to a softness his fingers recognized from the sleeve of his father\u2019s jacket in winter. The crack was there, exactly where Ana\u00efs had promised it would be, a hairline imperfection that ruined the story and made it better if you had a stomach for the truth.\n\n\u201cRight there,\u201d Ana\u00efs said, and her voice shook for the first time that day and probably the last. \u201cShe kicked it during a practice in a week when she thought quitting might be the real victory and the ball hit the post and came back and hit her in the mouth, and she laughed so hard she sat down. She told me that story in this room and swore me to secrecy because the story works better without the laugh. I am too old for stories that work.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do we do with that knowledge,\u201d Lila asked, and the practical shape of her voice steadied the room.\n\n\u201cWe put it back with its crack facing camera,\u201d Ana\u00efs said. \u201cWe let the myth adjust. You do not correct an ocean, you let the tide look like its own idea. Tomas, you are going to carry it to the case, and your hands will be on it, and no one will be able to make a clean sin out of that, because they will want the picture of the ball more than they want the picture of you. Lila, you will stand where people can see your profile and decide not to lie to themselves about why you let him pass. Ezra, you will go home and hide that expression you are wearing so your wife does not accuse you of being in love with a circle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d Ezra said, and for once he did not make it a joke, because worship was a poor habit for men and a fine one for citizens.\n\nThey walked the way a procession would if it had been invented by clerks and soldiers and old women and one man who was trying to learn humility. The corridor was short enough not to ask courage and long enough to make you consider your posture. Lila went ahead and the guards saw her and pretended to enjoy her authority. The Book would not catch this because Ana\u00efs had turned down the volume of its seeing for three minutes on account of a scheduled dusting. The case yawned politely because the hex had been talked into cooperation. He set the ball down, and his hand lingered an instant too long, and he said goodbye not to an object but to the idea that he had not made choices yet, because after this every choice would be compared to this one and measured for its balance.\n\nAfter, people in the lobby clapped because they did not know whether to whistle. Someone sang a line from the Book that was not actually in the Book and got away with it. ana\u00efs stood as if she were vibrating slightly, like a string under the finger of someone who knew the exact pressure to produce clarity. Lila leaned on a pillar and raised one eyebrow at him as if to say: Put your hands in your pockets now, because men who have just done something in public and leave their hands visible look either weak or predatory, and I would prefer you looked like a person who had bought oranges and walked home.\n\nHe obeyed. He bought oranges because it was now a talisman as well as a snack, and he put one in each coat pocket and felt the weight like something honest among all the practiced fictions. He walked back into the city he had made worse for some people and better for none yet, which was not as consoling as he had hoped it would be. The imitation ring was light on his finger and did not care about any of this. The Book might know his face again if it wanted to, because cameras learn fast when they are told to. He had put his hand on the ball and now he had to live with the way that had arranged his future.\n\nIn her office, Mira watched the clip the Hall\u2019s feed had produced and had to admire it, which was irritating. The crack was evident if you knew where to look, and the line the official account had posted about history being a house and lighting rooms had been repurposed as if they had been waiting for it. The comments were elegant in their performative grief and then grew toothy in their relief, because relief comes with a right to scold. She paused the clip on a frame where Lila\u2019s jaw was a geometry problem and Tomas\u2019s hand was still a shadow near the ball, and she felt the ache in her face that meant she was going to have to acquiesce to a narrative she had not authored. She turned off the screen and took the little gold clock pin off her lapel and rolled its face between her fingers until the minute hand bent half a degree, a sacrilege only she would notice.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d she said to the empty office, because saying fine to a room is a way to put arrogance down somewhere it cannot grow. \u201cWe will let this travel. We will speak about cracks and scars and the beauty of refusal. We will reference men without naming them and women without apologizing. We will talk about respect as if it were water. We will hunt you later when the light is worse and the applause has stopped.\u201d\n\nTomas went back to the bench where children chose captains and tried to pretend choosing mattered in this small case more than what they did after. A boy pointed at him and then at another boy and then at the floor, and he smiled and shook his head as if he had been offered candy he had already decided to refuse. A woman sat on the other end of the bench and put her bag down like an accusation and then pulled out a sandwich and broke it and handed half to him without looking. \u201cYou are brave,\u201d she said as if they had been discussing the weather, and he shook his head because calling him brave would endanger him faster than any warrant.\n\n\u201cI am someone with oranges in his pockets,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a different class of citizen.\u201d\n\nShe laughed and he let himself enjoy the way sound can be a hand on your shoulder when you aren\u2019t looking. He ate half the sandwich and thought about the things he had set in motion and the pieces he hadn\u2019t found names for yet. He thought about his sister\u2019s voice on the telephone saying, Don\u2019t get fired for saying the wrong true thing, and the way wrong and true had braided themselves like those plastic bracelets children made and then lost in gutters. He thought of Lila, who had already spent her quota of bravery for the month and would doubtless be asked for more, and of Ana\u00efs, who had put a hand on his and made him feel the dignity of small disobediences. He thought of Mira, whom he had never pretended to understand because she did not pretend to be understandable.\n\nHe had a hole in the Book that had his shape and would probably be paved over in the morning with something smooth and plausible. He had a ring that lied kindly and would betray him if he asked it for love. He had men and women in basements and on ladders and at desks who had decided to take small pieces of their own fear and build something with it that was not a barricade. He had a mother who asked for bread and soup and his face in her doorway on Sundays. He had a city that might not forgive him but might learn to speak about forgiveness in a new tense. He had oranges, which were sweet and exacting, and he had the necessary arrogance of a person who had decided to stop being an audience for a while and learn how to do something frightening on a stage he did not own.",

On screens it tilted just enough to catch light like a healed seam; in print it sat upright as if it had always been part of the design; in conversations it widened and shrank according to who was using it as a mirror for their own beliefs. The city discovered relief and criticism could coexist for a morning without biting each other, which felt to everyone like progress until it didn\u2019t. Tomas watched it all sideways through other people\u2019s mouths and the occasional generous newspaper left on a bench, and he noticed how quickly an image becomes a proverb if you splash it on enough clean surfaces. He carried oranges because he liked the weight and because strangers noticed the fruit and sometimes smiled, and he found that the small economy of shared glances could replace, for an hour or two at a time, the more violent economy of the feed.\n\nMira Vost stopped pretending the hole did not interest her. She called her counsel and then sent them away when they began to sound like a choir warming up on a hymn she did not care to sing, and she wrote on a yellow pad because paper did not yet ask for passwords. In the meeting with the Mayor she admired the exactness of the woman\u2019s tears again and allowed herself the private pettiness of wishing for once to cry over a thing and not over the work required to leverage it. \u201cWe will hold an evening,\u201d she said, and the word deliberately refused to be vigil or rally or forum, because words with teeth collect enemies faster than they collect affection. She asked for candles and told the procurement officer to call them lights. She told the Keepers to widen their net without dragging the bottom, and she forbade arrests inside the Hall because she did not intend to train the public to associate awe with handcuffs if she could help it. There were lines even she did not cross, not because she was tender but because she understood the maintenance schedule of a city\u2019s soul.\n\nLila slept in a room that could have belonged to a monk if monks liked neat boots and had to keep their hair ties in a cup so they would not look like talismans. She lay on her back and counted a set of muscles down her body to distract herself from asking whether Tomas would be foolish next at noon or at dusk, and she stopped on the small stubborn knot in her calf that had never fully forgiven the flood for teaching her which way to run. The unit\u2019s chatter snuck through the vents because nothing in the building stayed where you put it if it could travel by echo, and she listened to a young officer practice the voice he intended to use on someone\u2019s mother. She stood and wrote herself a note on her palm with a blunt pencil: doors, shoulders, oranges, because three of those words contained everything you could teach someone who did not want the Book to be their entire diet. After breakfast she pressed the paper-thin coin into a payphone and listened to the comfort of static because nothing in that connection wanted to optimize her. She told a woman who ran a laundry in the south quarter to leave an orange in the third dryer this afternoon and to tell a boy named Demitri to look for it, and when the woman asked why, she said because I am teaching myself to like redundancies again.\n\nAna\u00efs Vel wrote a label card that did not need to get through committee because she had moved the committee meeting by an hour and then forgotten to tell anyone but the janitor. The card said, very simply, that objects that endure will show you where they have. She wanted to add a sentence about humility traveling in the company of wear and being, consequently, very bad at publicity, but something in her old curator\u2019s body told her that a single clause, plain as broth, would work better under glass than any speech. She chose hours and called them open not because she liked the word but because it refuted the old rumor that only those with uniforms and escorts were allowed to stand very close to certain things. When a junior kept reminding her that crowd control would be an issue, she said, the crowd has had control of itself before and will be flattered if you let it try. She put Tomas on the roster as a floor attendant under a name that had been used once for a carpenter who had repaired a stair and been paid with free entrance for life, and she smiled because sixty years later the covenant was still holding.\n\nHe found a printer in a basement that smelled of burnt sugar and defeat, a man who had inherited a letterpress and a father\u2019s bad jokes about fonts. The machine coughed and then took a breath, and with a little coaxing it agreed to lay down ink where Tomas pointed and to be patient when he changed his mind halfway through a line. He wrote a sheet he refused to call a manifesto because the word made his tongue lie to him, and he gave it a title that could be said out loud without moving the lips too much: Respect in Practice. The first rule was not a rule at all but a picture of a court with thirteen numbered dots and a dotted line showing how a ball could move through hands and space and come back to a person without making them more important than the others, and the second was a sentence that insisted people were allowed to be small and still be loud. The locksmith came down at lunch and read half the sheet and shook his head, not in disapproval but because he recognized the arrogant kindness of a man trying to teach the city to hum in a key it had forgotten. They printed five hundred because five hundred can be carried in a duffel without noticing and because a larger number would have made them feel like economists.\n\nHis sister called and swallowed his hello with a sigh that had a train schedule in it because her days were measured by bells and the lengths of stories children will consent to before you are obliged to laugh. She said someone had spoken to her headmistress in a voice that was all teeth and compliments, and the headmistress had told her to keep her family dramas off the premises unless they came with a curriculum. He told her he was writing a curriculum for standing on stairs and letting other people have the good angle for once, and she said he had always been infuriating when he tried not to be witty. She asked him if he had oranges in his pockets right now because she had become superstitious without intending to, and he told her he had, and then she told him that he would come Sunday whether or not there were officers sitting on the stoop playing at being potted plants, because soup was soup and their mother was stricter than the state.\n\nThey intended to catch him at Open Hours because it provided the symmetry administrators prize, and because the Hall\u2019s air was good enough to make a photograph of his arrest look less cruel. Mira had told them not to, and her orders had a longer shelf life than most, but orders travel badly when a junior has a chance to be the person whose name is said on a radio. Lila heard a shape of the plan through a corridor that liked to flirt with her and took the stairs two at a time because the elevator would have announced her intentions to the building\u2019s main nervous system. She found the man with the habit of asking for forgiveness and not permission and told him to forgive himself in advance for a thing he was not going to do, and when he blinked at her, she smiled like a knife behind a curtain and told him if he wanted to live long enough to enjoy bureaucratic vindication he would wait for her to stamp something. After he walked away she leaned on the wall hard enough to leave a memory in it, and then she called Ezra and said, in the tone that turned men into colleagues and colleagues into conspirators for exactly five minutes, that she needed a decoy with a mimic ring and a bad haircut to walk in at four twenty and out at four thirty-two, and she needed him to look bored in both directions.\n\nThe first of the hours were busy with people who had taken the day off the way you take off a sweater when someone says there will be wine on a terrace and then you arrive and it is a lecture. There were girls with hair plaited intricately because they had learned to put order where they could, and there were boys with their hands in their pockets trying to decide whether touching the glass would make them more or less suspect as citizens. The case listened and did not judge because its very existence was a human misinterpretation of humility, and the ball sat like a bird that had agreed to be near because you were quiet and not because it was tame. Tomas stood near a plaque and showed a little boy how to tilt his head to see the scuff that meant a day had been worse and then better, and he showed the boy\u2019s mother where her son\u2019s eyes were doing a dance between pride and confusion and told her that, yes, the crack was meant to be there now; no, it was not meant to be, and yes, both could be true. Someone tried to start a chant because they felt they were supposed to, and it stuttered and then dissolved into a murmur that felt better once it had found its level.\n\nMira watched from a floor that had been built to make overseers feel contemplative about the masses and therefore more righteous about having their own bathroom. She liked the way the crack refused to be allegory unless given consent, and she disliked how quickly the consent was being manufactured in the lobby by clever men with folded pamphlets in their hands. She saw Lila in profile and recognized the discipline of not looking at the person who mattered and the skill of appearing to be the one who could answer if a person insisted on making her day worse. When she had watched long enough to satisfy the part of her that enjoyed testing the polish on the city and finding where it had not taken, she went downstairs and stood, smaller than she preferred to be, beside Tomas and said without ornament that he was causing work. He told her he had been hired to cause work and she almost laughed because she preferred impertinence when it was dressed properly and did not come with slogans. She asked him whether he intended to continue being an audience member with excellent taste or whether he meant to write a program, and he said he was trying to teach people how to clap without waiting for a cue. They stood a long minute together, two people who distrusted the romance of eye contact, and she said, in a voice in which she did her most generous lying, that if he paired again, temporarily, she could make a part of this official enough that he would not have to practice his sneaking so often. He told her he would pair if the Book learned to whisper he rather than it when speaking about citizens, and she said he was asking for a hug and a dictionary from a machine that had been fed on recipes for obedience, and he said that meant he was asking the right person.\n\nThe Keepers moved with the confidence of people who believed that angles loved them and cameras would always choose their good side, and for a minute the lobby considered a role reversal and decided against it because the children were watching and people had worn their good coats to see a thing that was not a scuffle. Lila found the one with his jaw already squared for regret and leaned into his gravity and said there were three of him in the room even if he did not see the other two, and if he wanted to go home later without discovering a bruise shaped like a country he had never visited, he would move left now and then right later and he would think of his mother on a bench somewhere knitting a scarf for a winter that would not come. He moved because good soldiers recognize orders when they do not arrive in the proper packaging, and because his shoes had always regretted friction. Ezra\u2019s decoy yawned on schedule, and three men with high collars yawned back involuntarily, and in that small involuntary exchange a plan deflated enough to no longer be dangerous.\n\nAt six when the light makes every story prettier than the truth by half a step, Ana\u00efs took a breath she had been saving since the first rumor and told a group of women who had never met that yes, the ball had been moved, and no, the city was not going to ignite because people stood very close to something old and remembered their own bodies. She said, and she allowed herself the indulgence of the word because she had earned it, that care was not piety, and that respect was not obedience, and that a crack in a ball and in a story could serve as measuring tools rather than as excuses. Tomas lifted a child to see and felt for a moment the ghost of the guard\u2019s old chiding and felt then also his father\u2019s hands, not lifting the child but teaching him the posture of lifting, which is different. He caught a woman\u2019s eye across the case and knew because of the way she smiled that for the rest of her week she would be slightly kinder to her own lungs.\n\nOutside, a woman with a megaphone tried a phrase that would have got a person arrested last year and received instead a glare that said people were busy with something that required more tenderness than yelling. Two boys kicked a sock-ball very gently between their shoes as if teaching themselves the anatomy of compliments, and a Keepers\u2019 van purred like a cat waiting to be told it had been good. Lila stood with her hands in her pockets and reminded herself that pockets are for weapons and secrets and one of those is illegal and the other is not, and then reminded herself that the legality of secrets had been changed overnight before by women with smiles like lids on boiling pots. She saw Tomas begin to step toward the wrong door, and she lifted her chin a fraction to remind him that this building had three exits and the one he was choosing would deliver him into hands that had washed themselves recently in anticipation.\n\nHe ducked left into the corridor that smelled of lemon because no one had learned yet that lemon made people think of childhood, and he passed the service room where he had briefly become an unperson and felt the temptation to go in and do it again just to see if it felt different now that he had admitted to himself that he liked breathing without accompaniment. He put an orange on the base of the case because it pleased him to put something bright and mortal near something old and adored, and because he liked the notion that the cameras would not know where to file the gesture and perhaps the City would enjoy, for once, a moment for which there was no approved caption. On the street a man with a hat asked him for a sheet of his pamphlet and offered a stamp in return, and Tomas took the stamp because stamps make you feel like there are still systems that can be gamed elegantly without spilling blood. He walked to the square where the pigeons have no respect and the children throw corn and the old men argue about line calls in matches they did not attend, and he listened to the air settle now that the day had gotten its way with them.\n\nAt home, his mother put the soup on the table and told him his aunt had commented on the crack as if it were a scratch on a new car, and he said his aunt had earned the right to be precise and ungenerous in her metaphors. They played cards and she cheated before he got the chance, which she did to signal that she had not completed her transformation into a saint and would prefer if he did not force it upon her with his earnestness. She asked what he planned to call the thing he was building and he said he did not intend to name it at all because names behave like ropes and he needed something more like water, and she rolled her eyes and told him if he started talking like a priest she would make him scrub the baseboards until he remembered where the broom lived.\n\nBy midnight the Mayor\u2019s people were trial-ballooning an ordinance that would please the frightened and irritate the self-possessed, a policy with a long aspirational title that could be shortened to something as crude as a bruise if someone wanted to chant against it. They called it an act and packed into it smaller acts, and one of them would give the Book the authority to suggest and then insist on certain routes through the city for citizens whose rings read as agitated. Mira read the draft and wrote in the margin, quietly, that agitated was a category best left to water and children, and she balanced her pin on the edge of her desk as if she might allow it to fall and then did not. She imagined a future in which she permitted Tomas his project and admired its ferocity from a distance while clipping it when it brushed against power, and she imagined a different future where she cut it now and bore the headlines later, and she did the math with a calm that made her junior staff nervous because they preferred their cruelty to come with motion.\n\nThe next morning Tomas stood at the edge of a court that had not been painted in two summers and told whoever walked by that this was not a meeting, because meetings have chairs and minutes and these were feet and seconds. He said it again and again until it became part of the air and did not require his mouth, and people arrived with oranges because news travels fastest when it arrives as a joke. They put the oranges at the corners, not because it meant anything mystical but because it translated a circle into a square you could see from a window. He held up the sheet with the dotted lines and explained the drill and asked for someone who knew how to bark at timing without making enemies, and a woman with a voice that had frightened her into a good job volunteered to be heard. They ran the pattern until people felt both smarter and more foolish than they had an hour before, and when a man threw too hard and apologized without prompting, Tomas felt something like the Book\u2019s pulse in his old index finger and told himself it was simply blood remembering it had circuits of its own.\n\nThey did it again at dusk under a bridge because bridges are where you go to keep faith and because the weather had decided to be magnanimous in a way that made everyone suspicious. Ezra arrived with grease on his sleeve and a grin that meant he had convinced someone to do something dignified, and he brought three boys who had learned to sprint between cars and not die, and he brought the locksmith who refused to admit he had come to watch and insisted he was there to judge posture. Lila stood with her back to a pillar and called advice that sounded like scolding and scolded in a tone that felt like care, and when someone asked her what they were training for she said that the person who demands a plan before they pick up their feet will always be late. A girl whose braid would not hold said she did not want to be chosen last by captains anymore even in games that were not real, and Tomas told her that no captain worth anything would choose last, and she rolled her eyes and told him he was very good at prettifying disappointment.\n\nA boy brought a copy of the pamphlet to his grandmother and she read it aloud in a courtyard where the laundry trapped the sun, and two men who had not spoken in a decade agreed on one sentence and allowed themselves the luxury of pretending that was a reconciliation. In an office where the carpet felt like a lie, a woman penciled a schedule for officers to stand in unattractive weather at the edges of courts and pretended she was planning for safety and not for spectacle, and then she put down her pencil and walked outside and took her jacket off and tried the drill in high heels and did not fall, which taught her something she did not intend to learn. In the Hall, beneath the bronze, Ana\u00efs replaced flowers that had wilted with a dish of olives because she had decided the building needed salt, and she found the orange at the base of the case and held it to her face and smelled the day someone took a risk and did not go to jail for it, and she put the orange in her bag because the building was not going to eat it and she liked a fruit with a use.\n\nBy the weekend the city had decided that if the crack was going to be with them it might as well be given a chair at the table, and there were shirts that made it into a joke and then into a prayer and then back into a joke again, which is the proper route for symbols if you do not want them to grow too tall. The ordinance changed its angle twice and shed two unsettling verbs and acquired one new noun, and Mira adjusted her jaw like a woman choosing a necklace that says something without getting her robbed. The Book learned to list Tomas as an address when people searched for directions to a thing that did not have one, and it blinked and hummed and then let the error go because the algorithm had been taught, one time in a flood, to step aside when human traffic needed the lane. Tomas walked to his mother\u2019s on Sunday with a bag of soup and two oranges and a deck of cards, and he knocked three-twos and a pause because superstition had joined his growing toolbox and was proving heavier than expected.\n\nShe made fun of his hair and then touched his face in the doorway because those actions share an origin, and she asked him how long he planned to be young enough to get away with momentum as a strategy. He told her he was tired, not in a way that complained but in a way that admitted he had begun to understand he would have to be, and she poured him soup and told him to eat it before it cooled into philosophy. They played, and she cheated again, and he caught her this time and she was pleased because being caught means you were seen, and she told him there would come a week when he would regret asking the city to behave like a person and not a machine and that she would be there to accept his apology when his feelings were bruised. He told her there would come a week when he would be grateful he had asked at all, and that he would bring her oranges then too, and she waved a hand and asked him to go to the market with her because the woman at the fish stall needed to be told her sign was misspelled and would not accept the correction from anyone who did not look like a person\u2019s son.\n\nOn the way back from the market a van crept down the street like a thought someone did not want to say and then did, and Lila stepped from a doorway like a woman changing her mind about quitting a job and put her shoulder into the world just enough to make space. She did not look at Tomas because the role required indifference, and she told the driver she had reports of a sinkhole ahead and a very old woman who wanted to exorcise it and that the van would be better off avoiding both religion and unplanned geology for an hour. The driver recognized the tone that saves you paperwork later and turned, muttering the way men do when they suspect they are being cared for and do not know what to do with the kindness. Tomas stood with his mother\u2019s bag of fish in his hands and felt, for the first time without flinching, the outline of an army he might be capable of assembling, not an army of uniforms and commands but of benches and drills and refusals at precisely the right decibel. He thought of Mira and of the pin and of the way her mind had traced his absence like a calligrapher unwillingly admiring a rival\u2019s hand, and he thought of Ana\u00efs and the olives, and he thought of Ezra\u2019s scar and the locksmith\u2019s resignation, and he thought of his sister\u2019s laugh over a train bell, and he thought that if respect were a resource, they had been treating it like a statue when it wanted to be a rope.\n\nThat night, he took the pamphlet and wrote on the back with a pen that leaked sometimes and made his fingers look like he had been handling blueberries. He wrote down names paired with places, not to command them to be there but to remind himself where kindness had agreed to be bold: laundry, bridge, market, bench, gym, hall, classroom, stoop. He saw on the paper the beginnings of a net not made of metrics but of habits, and he understood with the slow solemnity of a revelation that the Book had never been a book to begin with, merely a loud room where people had been told to whisper into a single microphone. He did not know whether he was making a better room or simply another microphone, and he closed his eyes on that tremor because doubt is the seasoning that keeps you from poisoning anyone by accident. In another building, a law hardened by two signatures and a press release, and in the morning a field somewhere would be painted over with a brighter white and the edges would look crisper and less forgiving, and the children would trip on them and learn again the geometry of running and stopping and choosing which is harder.",

                              "content": "The evening Mira promised arrived wearing good manners like gloves, and the city accepted them because it likes to be courted in public before it is told what to do. All day the procurement teams called the candles lights and arranged them in boxes that felt like shipping kindness, and the feeds softened their fonts and practiced a tone that suggested grief had learned posture. The ordinance with the aspirational name had shed two of its more officious verbs after committee and acquired a clause about flexibility at the discretion of trained officers, which worried the people who worried, and relieved the people who preferred to be told these things were under control. On the trains, hands that did not usually carry anything carried white paper bags with strings of wax peeking like shy ideas, and the Book trailered beneath its banners a request for calm in the timbre of a mother at the end of a long day.\n\nTomas did not dress differently because costume would have felt like a lie even if he was arriving at a performance. He folded fifty sheets into his pocket with the same embarrassment a man feels carrying flowers for himself, and he put two oranges in his coat because superstition had become a form of inventory. He met Ezra at the edge of a square that cleaned itself on Saturdays and now shone like a conscience, and they stood watching the city arrange itself into versions of itself, the way you watch a crowd compose a photograph that will become the reference point for a year. The locksmith came in wool despite the warmth and positioned himself near a tree in case any metal decided to misbehave in his presence, and he looked as if he might scold a hinge for squeaking too publicly. Lila did not arrive so much as never leave; she had been at the edges of it all day, a kneecap in the city\u2019s stride, deciding when to apply pressure.\n\nMira took the stage when the hour made silhouettes flattering, and she did not bring the Mayor up with her because she understood ratios. She wore white because her hair had taught her the uses of monochrome, and she spoke briefly because the city had sat through enough long speeches to use the carpet as a mirror. She talked about rooms and light and history that refuses to be a flat painting, and she did not say ball because the word sounded like play, but she gestured in a way that made every camera line up the crack with her profile. She asked for nothing and suggested a posture, and then she stepped back and let a choir of schoolchildren sing not a hymn but a round about names, the sort of song that had traveled classrooms for two generations without flags being attached to it, and that felt like safety to people who were out of practice.\n\nAna\u00efs stood in the Hall with her hands lightly folded, not prayer but readiness, and she looked at the glass with an expression you reserve for friends you have already forgiven for something they have not yet admitted. The guards were bored and trying to hide it, which is a species of courage no one applauds. The case breathed in the manner of expensive things, which is to say only when you get too close. The ball sat cheaply and grandly inside its square like a saint who will never be canonized officially because enough grandmothers decided it was done. People came in two at a time and then three and then in clusters that moved with the choreography of decency rather than that of instruction, and Ana\u00efs watched a woman in a suit put her hand on her husband\u2019s sleeve not to control him but to adjust his angle toward the scuff that meant the story had stopped being an advertisement.\n\nThe plan for the evening from the side that does not write speeches was a circle, nothing more sophisticated than a diagram turned into motion. Ezra had drawn it in chalk that would not show on the stone and then had the sense to step back and let the crowd erase it with their feet. He started the first pass near the second fountain, where a statue pretended not to notice pigeons, and Tomas took up the other end by the bronze woman who holds a whistle like a sceptre. They did not bark orders; they asked questions that had been rehearsed in basements and on benches. If a person wanted to move to the pillar, they pointed to the person behind them and said, Your turn. If a person wanted to stand still, they opened their hand and let someone else pass through. It was small and infuriatingly gentle, the sort of revolution that leaves your shoelaces tied and your eyes a little wet because someone did not jostle you when you expected it and had prepared a defense for the jostle.\n\nAt first the Book misfiled what it saw as milling because its categories are good at distinguishing bodies but not at recognizing grace, and that gave them three minutes to be beautiful without commentary. When the Keepers\u2019 van hummed closer and found the nearest sensible place to be, which was slightly in the way, Lila stood at the edge of the circle and adjusted it by a degree and a sentence until the people moving were the ones who were impatient and the ones standing still were the ones who wanted to feel useful. Order arrived disguised as courtesy and took a breath no one heard. The van settled into the chug of an animal that has learned to wait. The junior inside, jaw squared for regrets he hoped to earn, watched the movement and wrote it off as the sort of thing citizens invent when asked to entertain themselves.\n\nThe provocation, when it arrived, came from the usual place: a man who believed damage is a kind of confession and who mistrusted an evening without an opportunity to be more important than his neighbors. He did not throw a flare at the Hall because Lila would have broken his wrist before his shoulder decided, and because even that kind of foolishness had learned to be self-protective. He tried instead to spray a slogan on the plinth of the bronze ball, a sentence that had been the title of an article last week and an epithet the week before, and he shook the can in a way that made the little ball inside clatter like a bell. The circle near him tightened and then loosened, a strange pulse that made space for Lila\u2019s hand without making its hunger obvious, and in that pause a boy of nine stepped in and put his palm flat on the stone where the paint would have landed, and the man did not know how to proceed because his target had turned into a child\u2019s hand. Lila took the can at the wrist and removed it with the sort of efficiency that graduates you into gentleness, and she passed it to a grandmother who had appeared from somewhere with a bag and the bag took the can as if it were a cucumber. The boy looked at his hand as if it had been held up by gravity, and then he went back to kicking his sock-ball at his sister, and the city allowed itself the surprise of a moment that did not escalate.\n\nMira watched from the stage and did not use her microphone because this was not hers to speak over, and she filed away the image of the grandmother with the cucumber-bag, because if she would be using this night later she would prefer the metaphor kept its realism. When the choir finished singing the names round, she addressed them as if she had noticed they had done something difficult well, which is the sort of compliment that keeps children from having to become officers later to feel valuable. She said, and she meant it in the way she allowed herself to mean things without flinching, that light was useful only if it was not weaponized, and she let the word crack appear on her tongue only once, and she pointed at it on the feed because she was not an idiot and because claiming a symbol early is how you protect it from people who have leisure to ruin it systematically.\n\nThe vigil had that soft ending that crowds invent when they are determined not to be orchestrated, and candles were pinched neatly instead of crushed like vanguards under a heel, and the square exhaled into streets that learned their lessons for the hour and then reverted to habit because cities are merciful to their own defects. Tomas felt the cutter\u2019s tug of adrenaline let go and in its absence the ache of having been good, a low hum in the bones that had nothing to do with righteousness and everything to do with not standing on the outside of his day. Ezra clapped him on the shoulder with a friend\u2019s brutality and told him that at least he had not been poetic in public, which deserved a pin, and the locksmith cited three doors that had enjoyed being opened without being impressed by themselves and suggested it could become standard practice if the city learned to trust its own wrists.\n\nThe ordinance became a pamphlet overnight, the way laws do when the nervous need to see them in their kitchens to believe in them, and Tomas found one tumbling in the gutter and read it while walking because that was how it wanted to be consumed. The guided routes had been softened into suggestions, with a collapsible list of \u201cconditions of agitation\u201d that would stand in court like a curtain does in a draft, proving only that a room is not entirely sealed. The clause about officer discretion had been italicized, which is the font you use when you want to whisper and be obeyed, and the diagrams were pretty because pretty sells fear to people who think they had their fill of it last year. He folded it into a square with the confidence of a boy who had learned to make paper into a ball and bounced it twice off a wall to hear if the sound had changed. It had not.\n\nThey raided the locksmith the next morning the way men who have been told to prove their relevance raid a bakery they suspect of selling wheat without stamps. It was polite and thorough to the degree that signals training and resentment; they asked where he had gotten the copper for the imitation rings and lectured him about fashioning lies, and he listened with the calm of someone who had survived three currencies and one winter when everyone learned how to reinforce windows with dignity. He lifted the late-model chips into the teapot by the register as if making tea and set down in their place a row of antique skeleton keys, an apology in metallurgy. When they left, he locked his door twice for the first time in a year and sent a boy with a very good sense of direction to tell Tomas, not because his shop was in danger but because someone needed to be reminded that the city had ears and no obligation to be kind when it got curious.\n\nMira summoned Tomas to her office without doing him the discourtesy of pretending it was a coincidence, and he went in with the exact caution of a man carrying something he could not ask the metal detector to ignore. The building breathed him and did not find the old pulse because the imitation ring was too polite to draw attention to itself, and that was an omen he would misinterpret later. Inside, the office looked like a photograph of a room that has seen a better argument, and Mira did him the honor of not pointing to a chair as if she were a hostess. She told him, still standing because some concessions need to be staged quite carefully, that she had no interest in arresting him as long as his next act did not humiliate her in front of people who were already predisposed to enjoy her humiliation. He told her he lacked the imagination to stage a humiliation sufficiently refined to satisfy her critics, which was a compliment if you understood the nerve required to say it.\n\nShe made him an offer that did not insult either of them so much as it tickled their old loyalties. He could pair again in a fashion that was half-ceremonial, join a pilot for teaching crowd management that avoided the word control, allow his pamphlet to be printed on better paper with a seal peeking out of the corner like a chaperone, and in exchange he would be given a radius inside of which no one would test his sincerity with handcuffs. For a minute he saw the elegance of it the way architects admire an arch, and then he saw the way it would turn his movement into an accessory, and he told her that he could bring his drills and his citrus to the city\u2019s stages if she promised to let failure be public and not to call it treason when a circle broke. She smiled in a way that taught him something about her he would not be able to use later, and she said she could promise it until Friday.\n\nLila watched the building adapt to having him inside it again, as if their conversation had fetched him back into the visible spectrum. She took the file her supervisor handed her with the air of a woman accepting the weather and read inside it a set of cautions that amount to affection when your employer is a city. Observe without discouraging, intervene without interrupting, permit the optics of kindness and suppress the optics of drift. She allowed herself the long private exhalation of a person who knows their job is to stand between a creative force and a law and keep both of them from embarrassing themselves, and she went downstairs and bought a packet of sunflower seeds because a courtyard nearby liked to be littered with something you could pretend was an innocent habit.\n\nThe schools adopted the part of the ordinance that makes the Book proud even when it is sad: the ask for rings to be worn visible for safety, the suggestion of routes, the language about supervision that makes teachers revolt briefly in stairwells and then go back to inventing workarounds. His sister called and emptied the sound of a bell into his ear by holding the phone near the hallway during change of class, and she laughed under her breath when she told him that eight girls in her second class had threaded baker\u2019s twine through their rings and made them into pendants and then tucked them inside their shirts, and that when the keeps-everything-straight administrator asked why, they said modesty and were not contradicted. He went to stand outside her school at dismissal, not to commit spectacle but to measure the city\u2019s evenness, and he saw the routes push and pause and adjust with the softness that will keep a child from turning into a clerk when she grows. He bought oranges and put them at two corners, not as charms but as promises, and the mothers smiled at him and allowed him to exist because he was holding fruit and not a megaphone.\n\nIn the Hall, the label Ana\u00efs had written in pencil survived the first wave of committees simply because no one had the stamina to object to a sentence that did not lean its weight on anyone, and under it the ball sat with a crack showing like an ankle, which in this city has always made people braver than they intended to be. She allowed a reporter to ask a polite question and she answered it with discourtesy disguised as a story about paint that did not match, and the reporter snuck her words onto a feed with a caption that made it sound as if the news had come up with the anecdote itself, and she went home tired and did not mind that the exhaustion had a tone she had missed. She bought two oranges on the way because she had begun to understand the currency they represented, and when she reached her stoop a girl with a braid asked if she could smell them, and Ana\u00efs handed one over and let the girl breathe it as if it were a book.\n\nThe city learned the shape of Tomas\u2019s refusal like a new piece of furniture in a familiar room, stubbed into it twice, and then rearranged itself to avoid bruising the same shin again. He discovered the limits of his ring\u2019s courtesy when he tried to collect his pay from an account that had been made conditional on acknowledgment of a tool he had taught himself to live without, and he stood in the bank with his palms open and told the young woman behind the glass that he could not offer recognition and that he had brought the paper of his pay in a file he could show her, and she did the math of decency and let the transaction proceed because sometimes discretion is just a clerk choosing not to ask a question. He slept one night in the gym because his building\u2019s lock decided to be proud and then ashamed and then obstinate, and the sound of Ezra\u2019s snore was both an insult and a benediction, and in the morning he washed his face in a sink that had been taught humility by years of chalk and sweat, and he felt human enough to continue.\n\nThey printed more sheets and did not call them anything, and the map of places grew into a list that lived on paper and in elbows: the laundry that would store your bag if you promised to wash two loads for strangers on Tuesdays; the bridge where children would be taught a pattern and then insist on teaching it to their uncles; the market where oranges were cheaper on Wednesdays for people who wore their imitation rings inward or not at all; the bench where old men would adopt two seats and make anyone who sat between them answer a question about whether respect was more like salt or like a broom. The Book tried briefly to categorize oranges as suspicious and then, when that misfire began to go badly on the feeds, surrendered and filed them as produce again, which is part of what keeps people sane in systems older than they are.\n\nMira visited her tailor after the evening because it calms the mind to have an old woman accuse you of wanting shoulders too broad for your actual guilt, and she let herself be pinned and prodded and teased into considering the fabric of a season in which she would have to move a fraction more like a penitent and a fraction less like a monarch. She instructed two Keepers to stand on a corner she knew would become important because respect had gone and gotten itself an address, and she made sure their orders included an admonition about their expressions because she did not want photographs of a scowl near a child learning to stand in a circle. She wrote one sentence in her own hand at the bottom of a memo and it said: This city thinks with its feet when you let it, and she put it in a folder that did not belong to any of her staff because she was sentimental in ways only she would notice.\n\nOn a Monday that refused to be better than it had to be, Lila found a notice in her box that might as well have been a summons, and it was written not in legal grammar but in the smaller cruelties of an institution that has decided to refine your purpose. She was to monitor the phenomenon in the squares and the courts and provide regular guidance, which looked like expertise until you read the line about escalation thresholds and understood that her job was not to bless a practice but to stand near it with scissors. She took the notice and used its clean edge to slice a dangling thread from her sleeve, and she told herself that this is what a decent bureaucrat does when asked to scratch at a callus: you tend to the finger with one hand and keep the other out of the socket. She met Tomas at a corner crowded with sunlight and told him that if he intended to make something permanent he should plan to watch it be stolen, and he told her that he had no intention of calling permanence anything but courteous stubbornness until they survived a winter.\n\nThe second crackdown arrived not as boots but as questions, because someone had decided to teach the public to ask for credentials again like a habit you put down for a season and have to be shown where it goes on the table. Men who were unused to being asked to carry proof of their names rediscovered indignation like an heirloom and polished it in caf\u00e9s until the waiters got tired and asked them to drink or leave. Women who had long since learned the physics of being weighed by glances decided to provide papers proactively and then look at the faces of the readers until some of those faces broke into something human. Tomas had nothing to show and could show it with a clean conscience, and he learned a new way to keep his hands, palms out, fingers splayed, not surrender and not threat but a posture you want to invent if you have no desire to be dragged into a room without windows.\n\nHis mother learned to carry oranges in her bag as if they were a prescription, and she began slicing them on her stoop and passing segments to any child who would take one without asking for a better story than thirst, and she told her sister that she did not intend to be anyone\u2019s symbol and that the day would come when her son would be punished for letting her become one. She withheld her game of cards one Sunday because punishment needs practice, and she watched his face learn that love and discipline are not two teams in a stadium but two halves of a rule. He went away after soup with the particular heaviness that announces a necessary humility and worked it out on a kitchen wall until someone banged with a broom, and he apologized to a ceiling and meant it.\n\nThe flood wandered back into the city\u2019s memory as summer drew itself up and made the river impatient, and in that collective shiver Tomas found a grammar he could use without calculation. He began to talk about drills as if he were asking someone to move a couch, and he found that when he framed respect as the art of not dropping something heavy on your neighbor\u2019s foot most people wanted to learn. He took to carrying a sketchbook like a tourist and drew diagrams of square corners and arcs of movement and the posture of a person braced to lift, and when people asked him if he was an artist he said no, which made them generous, and when they asked if he was a soldier he smiled and did not answer, which made them careful. He went to a hardware store and bought twelve hex keys and handed them out one at a time to people who had fathers or mothers who had taught them not to turn in a hurry, and he told each of them to fix one small thing in the city and then not to talk about it until someone else noticed.\n\nOn a day Mira had marked for meetings and instead filled with silence and tea because exhaustion had come to collect its bill, the Mayor made a joke about oranges and received laughter that taught her it was not yet hers to make, and in the Hall a child brought a lemon and put it next to the case because her mother had run out of the other fruit, and Ana\u00efs did not move it because substitution is a form of faith. Ezra lost a game underground and celebrated it because losing had become rare courtesy, and the locksmith taught a girl to seat a pin so gently that the lock sighed and then agreed, and Lila wrote three words on her palm that would not transfer to other surfaces no matter how much she wanted them to: patience beats pride. Tomas sat on a bench and wrote that he would rename nothing and that names are a way to close a hand, and he looked at his own hands and thought for a second that two oranges were quite a lot to ask of a person, and then the boy with the scar came by and stole one and peeled it and handed him a segment without explaining why we share, and he accepted, which is a language too.",

                              "content": "The river did its old trick of pretending to be asleep and then opening its eyes all at once. It came up with the specific indifference of water that remembers a route no one taught it, creeping first into alleys that had been repaved since the last time and did not think of themselves as vulnerable, then into the undersides of bridges where pigeons had enjoyed sovereignty, and then into basements like a guest who declines the good chair and sits on the stairs instead. The weather menaced in courteous phrases because the Book had taught even clouds to consider the optics, and the alerts arrived like toasts at a wedding wherein everyone was trying not to mention a cousin who always ruined the cake. People said it like gossip because that is how you make fear absorbable: up a finger\u2019s width on the south gauge, a palm on the east, the Old Quarter flirting with the third step already, better bring in the rugs.\n\nLila heard it first as a change in the footfalls on her stairwell. The building had a particular composure when it rained and another when it flooded, and this morning it had chosen the latter, filling with the quick polite steps of people determined to be on the useful side of necessity. She checked the routes the Book suggested and watched three little animated flows try to use the same narrowing of street by the bronze woman with the whistle, and she swore under her breath not at the flood but at the diagram. The revised ordinance had already imagined this\u2014guided routes for agitation, suggested paths for order\u2014and it did the wrong thing beautifully now, channeling everyone toward a choke point so photogenic it felt cruel. She called it in to Mira and said, not in code because sometimes clarity is the kindness you offer a superior, that if they did not break their own rails for an hour they would be explaining to grandmothers why high heels make poor paddles.\n\nMira was at her desk with a damp pin on her lapel and a jug of coffee that had been attempting to look authoritative. She had lived through three floods and a coup that had only been named that after it failed, and she understood the art of arresting a reflex. She walked to the window and watched the river try on a new bank like a dress it might keep, and she told Lila calmly to walk the routes closed by remembering which doors the city liked to leave ajar. She called three Keepers and told them their discretion was now policy. She called the Mayor and told her not to wear boots on camera because the boots would make apologies look like vanity. She sent a note to the Book in the only language it always processed before any other\u2014maintenance\u2014and requested, on behalf of Civic Flow, an emergency widening of the deletion throttle for rerouting notices, because now was not the time for arguments with a system about dignity. She wrote in her own hand at the bottom of the memo: Let the feet choose.\n\nTomas woke to the city making the sound it makes when it is thinking about drowning. He put one orange in his pocket and then another because superstition is not something you fight on a day that asks for obedience to older gods. He slid the imitation ring to the middle joint of his finger and willed it to behave, then put his ear to the window because the water speaks to people with no microphones if you let it. It said the simplest thing a river ever says, which is hurry wisely. He went out and found Ezra already on the steps with a coil of rope that seemed tired of living in a bag and eager to be a line between two obligations, and they did not argue because floods do not enjoy debate. They went to the bridge first, where a cluster of people had gathered to be clever and take pictures, and Ezra banged a rhythm on the railing that managed to be both festive and alarming, which is the form of punctuation a crowd will obey if it has just been given something worthwhile to do.\n\nThe drills had been a kindness when they were pretend; now they were a permission. Tomas put down his sheets and did not apologize for his own handwriting. He took chalk from a boy who looked proud of the theft and drew three arrows on the ground that would defy the Book\u2019s purpler map, and then he moved until people\u2019s eyes found his shoulders and used them as law. He did not bark, he asked in the tone of someone handing you something heavy that he does not want to drop on your foot. The circle was a corridor now, the dotted line a chain made of patience and rope. The market gave up its oranges because fruit prefers to be eaten but will substitute itself as a bright mark whenever the city is confused, and they laid the fruit on stairwells and at the head of a slope into the subway so people would know which direction the favor ran. Ezra took three boys and taught them how to lock a gate open without bending the metal\u2019s feelings, and the locksmith appeared like a condemnation with a hand saw and a bag of apologies and began to talk to hinges the way you talk to the last stubborn relative at a wedding table.\n\nThe Book tried to follow and then tripped. Its routes looked clean on a screen but in the wet the corners changed their angles like cats crossing a room, and the rings began to stutter: agitated, relaxed, wet, unauthorized, wet. The emergency gates at the Hall blinked themselves into an ethical crisis; they had been taught to open for women and for emergency badges and for the official stanchions of a filmed tour, but not for the messy, uncoiffed flow of a city deciding in a hurry to be decent. Tomas reached the back door and presented the polite lie of his ring and got a refusal that tasted like tin, and before he could retry the old developer trick, Lila stepped from the lobby\u2019s shadow and pressed the heel of her hand at the precise point where old wood flirts with pride. The door learned again the muscle memory of a good shove. It opened as if ashamed of being an obstacle. She did not look at him and he did not thank her, because the city had been designed to be grateful to itself in emergencies, and they both respected the architecture.\n\nInside, Ana\u00efs had made her decision before she stood up. You move the labels first, not because they are more precious than the objects but because they are light and they remind you what language you planned to use when you were less afraid. She went through the gallery with her arms full of laminated sentences and set them high, and then she stood before the case and looked at the ball as if it might say do not fuss. She did not intend to be the curator who drowned protecting a sphere, but she also did not intend to present the city with a headline that suggested it had lost its nerve and its original sin in the same night. She turned down the Book\u2019s eyes in the room because grief should not be asked to give good angles, and she called out to the boys with the rope in a voice that no one heard as pleading because age had given it a condescending clarity. They sandbagged the door that liked to fail in warm weather. She told a girl in a jacket to stand by the photograph of the goal and explain to anyone who would listen why the paint had mismatched on the railings in the old stadium, because floods require distractions as much as they require bags of dirt.\n\nThe first wave reached the hall like a guest who had memorized the address properly and wished to leave a gift. It put two inches on the floor in the service corridor and then reconsidered entering the lobby because the angles were wrong and the crowd\u2019s posture was discouraging of insult. A boy whose boots had been made for puddles and policy sloshed in and found a bucket and was instantly important in the way nine-year-olds are when a room is misbehaving. The case fogged; the crack became a white line as unapologetic as chalk. Someone took a picture because you cannot help it; everyone else turned to sand with their hands. Lila took two Keepers in their crisp uniforms by their elbows and smiled at them with such warmth that it took them four minutes to realize they were stacking bags at a pace she had not permitted herself in a year. Ezra\u2019s rope decided it would be a chain barrier and then thought better of its vocation and became a dragline for the nearest drain. The locksmith found a grate that had lost its screws to enthusiasm two administrations earlier and put it back in line with a hex and a murmur.\n\nAcross the river, guided routes on screens in buses updated themselves with the desperate confidence of a person who carries a map and refuses to ask a child for directions. Congestion happened where congestion always happens when people mistake pretty lines for streets, and a necessary panic began to practice its vowels. Mira went to the rotunda with its sickly acoustics and told a roomful of microphones that the city had been asked to solve puzzles before and had solved them with its knees as often as with its chin. She named, without naming, the people calling the drills at the corners and the boys who had learned how to get a gate to open for a kid and a dog at the same time, and when a Keeper\u2019s supervisor asked on a very live channel whether this was an endorsement of unauthorized civil practice, she said calmly that it was a suspension of enforcement and an endorsement of survival. The Mayor arrived in boots that were not a joke and stood behind her as if she had learned in a single hour the etiquette of second chairs. Someone in the corner counted this as a victory and put it in a file. Mira watched them and decided to follow up later and make certain it did not become a performance.\n\nTomas learned a thing that day about design. A circle that had been a drill could be turned into a wheel that pulled a person out of a street when a car decided it wanted to be a boat. Four people in a square could make a ladder if you were generous with your shoulders. If you asked an old woman to hold a rope and told her what it was attached to, she would hold it until her hands blistered and then find someone with younger skin to take over without false ceremony. The oranges that had been wayfinding became floats for a minute and then signals bobbing at the mouths of alleys, a constellation that taught the aerial cameras humility because they could not see the pattern clearly enough to name it. He catalogued silently which corners held because the children already knew where the water would go, and which failed because someone had once rewritten a curb in a report and forgotten to tell the curb.\n\nIn the middle of the hurry there were the odd small graces. A woman who had always been careful with her voice found herself shouting orders to two men and liked the sound sufficiently to look embarrassed later in private. A Keeper who had been trained to make his presence an argument discovered that if he took off his hat children did what he asked faster. A boy whose father had told him never to be first at anything for fear of mistakes moved first anyway because a cat needed help getting out of a basement window and he recognized, without learning it, that there are rules and there are cats. A man in a wool coat who had never reached into a stranger\u2019s bag without asking took the oranges out because the bag would float better lightened and for once didn\u2019t ask to be forgiven.\n\nThey lost some things and pretended not to weep. Carpets went the way of all rugs in cities that have opinions about rivers. A school\u2019s collection of outdated atlases became pulp in a hallway that for a week will smell like regret. A photograph in a frame on a stoop of a man who had not come home from a younger flood went soft, and his daughter picked up the wet paper and flattened it under the glass again because it felt more faithful to suppose that the man\u2019s face had simply learned to live in water. The Hall kept the ball, and if that sentence felt proud to Ana\u00efs as she thought it, she forgave herself because the cases are not meant to be funerals.\n\nBy afternoon the river found its ceiling in the neighborhood where the brick remembers better than the concrete. The city exhaled in increments because it had learned not to be greedy with relief. Lila stood with her hands on her hips and allowed herself to notice the pain that had taken up lodging under her rib when the sirens started, then put her hands down because posture becomes a habit and she did not want to teach a new generation of girls to hold themselves in readiness for too long. The Keepers who had been sent to police postures found themselves stacking crates and repeating jokes they hoped would convert panic into rhythm. The van that had waited earlier for an excuse now idled like an old cat, clean and without purpose. The ordinance, in a small miracle of bureaucratic grace that she would later pretend she had planned, read to her in a new draft as If the water exceeds the curb by more than three inches the routes are suggestions and the officers are citizens until the second bell.\n\nMira gave away credit the way expensive women give away compliments\u2014measured, sparkling, clearly expensive\u2014and that is why it worked. She mentioned the boys with the ropes by their first names on a feed that did not usually carry names unless there was a title attached. She mentioned the oranges without charming herself, which would have been fatal, and then noted the laundry that had kept bags safe and the gym that had let people sleep and the bridge where a girl had counted and kept count even when her own mother needed a hand. The Book stuttered in the way it does when you ask it to tell a story instead of to count, and then it learned. It began to file certain movements under a new tag\u2014pattern: courtesy\u2014and someone with a sense of humor in a room Tomas would never see named a category of behavior respect not because they believed it but because they wanted to be on the side of an argument that was beginning to look like funding.\n\nAt dusk, when the city has always looked best at forgiving, the water began to make a sound like a crowd after a concert, tired and pleased with itself and ready to eat. People picked up their shoes and then their judgments and carried them home. Ana\u00efs sat in the office with the plant and the stool and washed her hands in a bowl because the taps had elected piety and refused to work. She did not pray at the ball, and she did not call anyone a hero, and she took the orange from the base of the case and cut it and ate it deliberately and thought, This city remembers best when the memory has a taste.\n\nThe morning after, the oranges caught in the railings looked like a row of small suns hung out to dry. Children walked to school with their socks damp and their mouths full of commentary because they had discovered the crowd would listen to them if they talked in declarative sentences about who needed to be lifted next time. The locksmith opened his shop despite the wet and hung on the door a sign that read in his precise hand: Keys for doors stuck by damp pride. He expected to be raided again and looked forward to arguing about adjectives. Ezra found his rope heavy with the silt of useful work and draped it over a radiator as if it were laundry, hummed a tune that might have been older than the game, and allowed himself the little private disgust a man still feels about crying in public even when the public is busy.\n\nTomas walked the path the Book said he should and then the one the water had, and then the one his feet wanted, and he offered help where help had learned to be asked for politely. He saw the places where their drills had fit exactly into the city and the places where they had not, and he wrote two lists because lists comfort men who have been entrusted with a feeling they did not ask to own. He went to his mother\u2019s and unclogged the drain with a metal hanger and a patience that had not died with his father, and when she said nothing about the flood or the oranges or the boys saving cats, he understood that her silence was the only way she could give him back his peace without diminishing herself. She set down soup and told him she would not be wearing boots to any vigils, and he told her he would not be the person to ask her to.\n\nMira received three letters hand-delivered by couriers who had learned to roll their trousers to the knee and keep their socks dry. One was from the Mayor\u2019s office and contained three compliments and a suggestion that next time the optics might be tidier; she placed it under her water glass and watched the ink run. One was from a club of women with long memories and longer knives, congratulating her on a decision their grandmothers had recommended in letters none of the current staff had ever bothered to read; she wrote them back and said, you can thank Ana\u00efs instead and do it with olives. The third letter had no sender and only one sentence, which said: we will not embarrass you unless you make us lonely, and she put that one in a drawer with a birthday card and the membership pin from the time she had allowed herself to be in a club that wanted her.\n\nLila stood in a meeting where the woman with the face of a saint and the habit of a butcher attempted to turn the flood into a set of metrics. She listened quietly to the polite brutality of a chart and then put her hand up only once to say that the number of people who raised their hands to carry something heavy counts for more than the number of times a route was obeyed. She was told to put it in an email because the Book cannot change its mind without a noun to pin to a graph, and she smiled and did what she was told because sometimes obedience is a way of resting. After, she went to the bridge where the chalk had been replaced with a smear and considered the river like an enemy who might one day be a friend if you both ended up at the same table by chance. Tomas appeared with two oranges and a look that suggested exhaustion had decided to be handsome for once, and he handed her one and said nothing because they had earned the right to be quiet together for a minute.\n\nThe flood washed one secret into the open. A neighbor who had lived at the edge of the boys\u2019 basement court had stood in his doorway and told Ezra\u2019s wife that he remembered the old man with the red box and the patience of the slow twist. He had been there the night Tom\u00e1s\u2019s father had waded in too far to fix the power on a floodlight at the end of the street so that an ambulance could see the hole where a car had gone down. He had told him not to, and he had done it anyway, and the light had come on for three minutes and given a dozen people the exact amount of clarity they had required to cross a street in the right direction, and then the current had, as they say in official reports, rearranged him for good. Tomas listened and thought not of heroism but of torque, of that last slow turn that a person offers a thing that does not intend to yield and then does. He went home and took the little hex key he had begun to carry and put it on the windowsill where the sun would teach it patience.\n\nAfter the flood there were the small meetings that are not meetings. A laundry agreed with a corner store that oranges would be cheaper on days when the river coughs. The gym posted hours that meant men could sleep there when their buildings had decided to pretend they were boats. A school practiced a drill that did not carry the scent of terror but did include mothers and three very impatient dogs. Ana\u00efs started a ledger on paper that listed which local histories could be moved upstairs fastest by children and which required lifting with hands that had lifted a couch, and she wrote herself a small, stern note about not crying where cameras could find her. The locksmith taught a girl to rekey her own bedroom door because a girl should not have to ask, and when her mother looked dubious he said, gently, that being safe had always been the origin of manners. Lila ordered her unit to carry sunflower seeds and a spare rope, and the new boy laughed and then, to his credit, bought the seeds.\n\nThe Book learned a new trick so slowly it was almost touching. It started to send messages that were not commands to certain rings when a certain tag was crossed with a certain weather, and the message did not say obey or proceed. It said ask, and then, as if it could not help itself, it said: thank you. Tomas saw one on someone else\u2019s screen over a shoulder on a bus and almost dropped his orange because there is nothing more dangerous in a city than a system that has decided to learn politeness. He pressed developer mode almost without intending to and saw, in the quiet hum of the maintenance logs, a line that said: Anomaly: pattern\u2014courtesy\u2014reduced fatalities at Bridge C by 17% (estimated). He closed it quickly because he did not want to develop the habit of looking for applause in other people\u2019s code.\n\nHe took one day to be foolish and took his sister to the Hall, because you do not tempt memory too often if you do not want it to become an adversary. They stood before the case and she made fun of the pomp, and he made fun of her making fun, and Ana\u00efs caught them and pretended to scold because scolding is how you welcome people who have done the work without asking for a ribbon. A child stared at the crack as if it were the first polite imperfection she had been taught to enjoy, and the boy with the scar stood farther back because some love is better at a distance. Lila came in at the back, not in uniform, and stood a minute with her hands open as if to show she was not on duty and then left because she had paperwork for once and paperwork, if done with decency, can be a form of prayer.\n\nWhen the water finally retreated like a shy actress and left the city to sweep its own stage, Tomas went to the river with his red box, which was not his father\u2019s but might as well have been for what it carried. He did not toss it in because drama is cheap when it is private. He opened it and took out a key and turned it in his fingers until his hand learned again the patience he would need for the next refusal. He thought of Mira with her white hair and her arithmetic and of her offer dressed up as policy, and he thought of saying yes to certain stages and no to certain microphones, and he thought of Ana\u00efs making her list in pencil and of Ezra\u2019s rope smelling like a basement and of the locksmith hiding chips in his teapot while teaching polite people to press their shoulders into doors with more confidence. He thought of his mother on the stoop handing segments of orange to any child who asked properly, and he thought, not for the first time, that respect might be not a statue or a scarf but a tool you passed down as if it were family.\n\nThe city looked, for a week after, like it had been dipped very quickly in a different mood and set to dry. People carried themselves with the careful exhaustion of a person who has set a room back to rights and is trying not to notice that one chair will now always wobble. The ordinance returned to its quieter clothing and behaved itself with the primness of a rule that has been forgiven, and its clause about officer discretion remained italicized and therefore dangerous. The drills took on the character of older customs, like sweeping a stoop or naming a baby after a piece of the weather that nearly killed you. Tomas stopped correcting people when they called what they were doing a game because he had decided to be done pretending that pleasure and survival are distant cousins.\n\nOn a Wednesday so ordinary it felt brave, Mira convened a meeting she did not name. Ana\u00efs came and brought an empty folder, which is what curators do when they suspect they will be asked to carry something ugly home. Lila came and stood without leaning because leaning could be misinterpreted as weariness in minutes later. The locksmith arrived a full five minutes late on purpose and then apologized elegantly because he had not been invited formally; Ezra sat in the back with a rope on his lap because he liked to see people glance at it and adjust their opinions of what mattered. They talked about scars and whether the city should teach itself to celebrate them, and they talked about the Book and whether it would forgive being taught to whisper please, and they talked about ordinances and italics and what to do about the corner by the bronze woman where the water enjoys practicing cruelty. Mira told them what she could give them officially\u2014three hours of authorized circles a week, one supervisor with a title they would not hate, a line in a budget that would always be too small\u2014and what she could not: safety from curiosity, protection from envy, a guarantee that their oranges would always be read as kindness and never as code. They left with no paper that contained their names and yet with an understanding that had substance, which is increasingly rare in cities that admire signatures.\n\nThe night after, the boys played in the basement with a sock full of sand because the river had taught them the intoxicating difference between weight and mass, and they practiced throwing in a room that had just enough ceiling to punish arrogance. Tomas stood with his back to the wall, the sound of the ball against it an old liturgy in a new church, and let himself, in that unguarded quarter hour, be the boy his father had imagined he might become: someone who does the slow turning of necessary bolts with the precision that will not make headlines and the care that could keep a room from drowning. When he left, he locked the door with the new key, and he did not tell anyone he had left it under the third brick where the mortar cracks, because secrets are only useful if they are useful to more than one person, and the city was finally beginning to remember how to share.",

                              "content": "The week after the water stepped back as if it had remembered there were other cities to toy with, the oranges began to appear in windows the way candles had when people still believed vigil could stop a law. No one announced it and therefore no one could be accused of announcing it, which satisfied both the tender and the tired. A grocer who had lost three sacks of potatoes and a granddaughter to a good marriage put two fruits on his sill every evening before he set his tally stick on its hook; a woman in a dress she had ironed twice toward the hem and never toward the collar set one behind a pot of basil so it would be visible to anyone with a nose and a need; a barber hung a little net of them over his mirror and told a boy who stared that sometimes a city chooses a color because it wants to feel as if it has a flag that cannot be confiscated. The Book refused to make a banner of any of this, not out of malice but out of confusion, which is, in certain lights, a kind of mercy.\n\nTomas found himself walking slower in neighborhoods where fruit sat in windows, not because he had earned the right to take credit for any of it but because the sight of bright circles being allowed to be only themselves made his shoulders relax the way good music does when someone remembers to modulate at the right bar. He kept the imitation ring polite and his palms visible and discovered the rhythm of a man other people had begun to expect to be present when kindness needed choreography. It embarrassed him; it made his throat warm. He wrote it down as a problem in the back of his head: how to not become necessary in a way that makes other people lazy. He carried the red box a few times without opening it, just to remind his hands they had been trained to turn things that resisted that none of this was a permanent permission or a costume.\n\nMira watched oranges turn into punctuation and decided to let them keep their grammar for as long as the sentence stayed grammatical. The ordinance, which had never been intended to be poetry, acquired two subclauses in her hand that made the legal team sigh with relief because they looked like work and the public roll their eyes because they looked like permission disguised as homework. She had written them in the hour after the flood when her shoes were still wet and she had been inclined to humiliate her enemies and decided instead to make them complicit. She invited a certain set of women\u2014the kind men in her position refer to as \u201cdifficult\u201d when they are not listening\u2014to her office without calling it a listening session because fastidiousness would have ruined the thing, and she let them talk without pretending to take notes. When one of them asked whether oranges would be considered contraband, Mira very nearly smiled and said that contraband used to mean salt, which should teach them humility. She passed out glasses of water that did not taste of pipes. She ignored the Mayor\u2019s aide who kept asking whether there would be a photo and took the pin off her lapel for the second time in a month so it would stop reading as an oath.\n\nIt had been too long since anyone attempted to formalize what he was doing without insulting it. The first insult arrived as flattery: a brand that made shoes your feet would forgive approached him in the guise of a photographer with clean hair and better manners than sense and asked if he would like to star in a campaign about everyday courage, and he said no because he did not want to learn to see his face in windows he did not own. A second insult came as funding: a man with a smooth ring and a laugh he had practiced offered to underwrite printed sheets and a little office in a building that did not yet have rats and would therefore require rent on time every month. Tomas listened politely because his mother had taught him that charity is often just attention someone wants to record, and he declined with the kind of grace that would not earn him enemies now but would cost him later when the man needed, as such men always do, to be seen tearing down what they had failed to purchase. He took the insults as a sign of health. Insults only bother the living.\n\nAna\u00efs Vel was summoned to a room with glass and subtraction and suffered the indignity of being told to sit by a man who had learned to be comfortable without shoes somewhere expensive. He told her, with the confidence of someone who could hire three replacement curators for the cost of the carpet, that the Hall had always thrived when its narrative had been clear and that the recent flirtations with ambiguity, while thrilling to certain donors, had confused the base. She saw three things at once: his vowels, which had not been taught to pronounce the names of the corners of the city; his cufflinks, which made her hands itch for pliers; and the little white at the edges of his nostrils that told her he had lifted something heavy recently and found it heavier than his body believed things to be. \u201cWe sell clarity because clarity pays for the electricity,\u201d he said, and she said, in the voice she had used on sons and husbands and plumbers who wanted to be paid twice for the same accident, that the ball\u2019s crack would stay visible because honesty keeps the lights on longer. He told her there would be a vote. She told him he had already lost it and he asked her to leave because politeness is a leash they hand you when they are about to pull. In the elevator she allowed herself a small wicked grin because she had always loved elevators for their little theatre of containment; in the reflection she looked every inch the old woman in a tapestry with a pair of scissors in her lap, and the thought cheered her enough to get her through the next meeting with a junior who wanted to call her \u201cauntie\u201d and did not.\n\nIn the basement gym the game grew a second skin. The drills that had been drills in public and survival in a flood became practice for something no one wanted to name because names tell on you, and yet people need to point at a thing to talk about it. Ezra called it the circuit because he liked the ugly industrial ring of the word, and everyone pretended to hate it. They began to trace the same pattern at different scales: five bodies and thirteen dots and a dotted line in chalk and then the same pattern across a square with oranges and then the same pattern inside a building where the cameras had been taught to love symmetry and therefore watched all the right wrong things. Tomas did not call it anything. He called the numbers. He sat down with a girl whose father had been a policeman before the Book, and he showed her that the moment you resist is often the moment you double the noise in the room, and she taught him that sometimes noise protects. They were inventing a form of math that might, in another family, have turned into a better version of war.\n\nLila began the week believing she could hold everything she was being asked to hold with one hand while the other made the gestures that persuaded people the state had never meant anyone harm. By Wednesday she had to use both hands, and she did not like the feeling not because it made her look tired but because it meant something in the system had decided to act like a toddler in a doorway, insisting everyone step over it rather than getting up and moving. A new directive had arrived with important italics, reminding her to file weekly reports on informal gatherings that might \u201cconstitute emergent paramilitary formations.\u201d The list of indicators included circles larger than fifteen people, repetitions of a call-and-response not initiated by the authorities, and the presence of fruit used as wayfinding or admission tokens. She read it twice and took a photograph and then ate it because she knew someone who would search her bin a week from now and had decided not to give them the pleasure of finding it intact. When she met Tomas on her lunch break without calling it a meeting, she told him to start acting as if there were faces in every blank space, and he said he had been assuming that since childhood. She told him the word paramilitary had entered the room and he laughed, which is what a sane person does right up until someone knocks at their mother\u2019s door with the other version of the word on a paper with teeth.\n\nThe locksmith received a formal notice alleging that he manufactured devices intended to deceive civic infrastructure and inviting him to attend a voluntary conversation at a place that had the audacity to be called Neutral House. He set the paper under a wobbly table leg and came to the basement that night with his bag of patient metal like a man going to a baptism. He told the room that if anyone wanted a ring that lied, they could have one only if they swore to treat it as a tool and not as a garment, and that if any of the boys in the back had been playing with jammers they had bought with pretend money from someone with a haircut that required attention, he would take them apart and make them read the diagrams aloud until they learned shame. One boy laughed and then, to his credit, shut up and listened. The locksmith made two more rings that hum without consent and watched Tomas not ask for one. He felt an unexpected affection for the not-asking and hid it behind a lecture about temperature and solder.\n\nThe Book, having learned to whisper please to a set of rings during a flood, attempted to generalize courtesy and embarrassed itself. For three days it sent small messages to citizens near benches where drills were happening, messages that read as if they had been written by a careful aunt: Do you need a space? Would you like us to recommend a safe path? We have noticed patterns of courtesy nearby. It did not occur to it that surveillance was easier to digest under panic and more offensive under leisure, and it learned the lesson the way machines learn anything worth keeping\u2014through public humiliation followed by a change in the rules. Mira told the team to stop A/B testing kindness and go back to smoothing the edges of loud corners. A junior engineer, who had taught himself the maintenance taps during the flood and thought that meant something radical had happened inside him, wrote a memo suggesting the Book learn to ask the city what it wants before assuming the answer. The memo was not read aloud at any of the meetings. The junior took to visiting the bridge after work and counting oranges like stars.\n\nTomas\u2019s sister, whose school had learned the art of being official and disobedient at the same time, found her pendants confiscated by a vice principal who had convinced herself that modesty was an act of aggression. The girls came to class the next day with rings tied to their shoelaces and looked the woman in the eye until she looked down and found herself smiling despite having intended to do the opposite. That afternoon their teacher took them out into the courtyard and showed them how to make circles with chalk that could be washed off quickly when someone came asking about property, and she told them to practice choosing without cruelty. A boy asked whether the city would be nicer if the girls were in charge and she told him a city is nicest when nobody is sure who\u2019s in charge but everyone is sure they are answerable to their neighbors. That evening she called Tomas and told him she was tired of being charming and that he could be the charismatic one this month; he told her he was trying instead to be competent. They laughed in the way siblings do when their strategies are different and both are required.\n\nThere was a night set for a scrimmage that no one called a scrimmage because people do not know a renaissance when they see one, and everyone took two steps back from calling it an exhibition because they had not yet rested enough to permit spectacle. It happened under the cracked halo of old stadium lights that had been paid for with a fundraiser disguised as a birthday party for a woman who hated birthdays, in the field that had earned a reputation for being safe only if you were either very fast or very young. Lila arranged her unit\u2019s routes so that the officers who liked to be photographed would, with no insult intended, find themselves solving a parking problem elsewhere. Mira signed a form permitting a civic event that did not exist. The locksmith looked at his tools and decided they would be happier on his bench than on his belt. Ezra counted boys in the morning and counted them again at dusk, which is a habit mothers have taught boys who become fathers without admitting it.\n\nHe had not intended to stand in the center circle and say anything, but the city had taught him that if you do not say something, the wrong person will. Tomas walked to the middle of the field with his palms open, which is a gesture that reads as harmless and is also the correct posture for catching, and he asked the noise around him to rearrange into something listenable. He did not say history or hero or rights or duty. He asked anyone who had ever put their shoulder against a door and felt it yield to walk a step forward. He asked them to remember what it felt like when it moved, the ridiculous intimacy of wood changing its mind because your weight had been respectful. He asked the camera operators to give their batteries a rest because sometimes beauty does its own recording. He asked the girls who had practiced three afternoons a week until their legs had opinions if they would like to go first, and the girls nodded with an economy of motion that is the envy of saints, and they passed the ball around the circle with a precision that made the old men shake their heads for the pleasure of it.\n\nThe ball itself did not come. Ana\u00efs had carried it once into the center of a room full of good-throated people and had watched their faces do the thing you are not supposed to force faces to do. She kept it in its case now and brought a different one from the archive, a cousin without a lineage, and handed it to Tomas with the instructions you give someone when you are willing to trust them for an hour but not for a cause. He understood and was grateful for the sting of her stinginess. They played until sweat looked good and until two boys who had come to make fun of anything that looked like yearning stopped making fun. They played until the Book\u2019s cameras, which had been instructed quietly to permit a certain amount of practice under the rubric of public wellness, learned the shape of a circle at speed and decided it was not dangerous. They played until Lila had to put her hand out to stop a woman from crying because the woman\u2019s tears were about a daughter who had left rather than about the game and crying at the game would sour it.\n\nBacklash came that week dressed as reason. A group that had gotten very good at naming things before anyone else could name them called itself the Glass Choir and began to say in thick syllables that respect had become theater and theater had become a cover for something they preferred to call recruitment. They had a slogan you could put on a pin and they had a list of generous donors and they had a spokesperson who had been trained not to blink too often while lying. They produced a little animation explaining how a circle looks like a cell looks like a cell, and how any practice of coordination outside state auspices was an invitation to the old ghosts to come back with better shoes. The Book gave them three days of kindness before it noticed their numbers were boastful and their verbs were disappointedly energetic. Mira declined to debate any of them because she did not intend to teach her opponents how to be charming. Lila removed a boy\u2019s Glass Choir pin as gently as a grandmother removes a thorn and told him, in the exact tone his mother would have used, that he could pin it back on if he decided he liked being told what to think.\n\nThe bus stop man found him again, the one with the developer taps and the midnight gift of riddles, and this time he gave himself a name: a small sound like a pebble skipping twice and then sinking. He told Tomas there were others who knew the maintenance code and that he had been selfish, keeping it as a parlor trick during floods, and he was feeling generous enough to become a mentor. He showed him a panel that did not exist for anyone who did not press two points and hold their breath between a heartbeat and a story, and he let him see the threads that had begun to form between rings that had whispered please to one another the day of the flood. It looked like a nervous system and like a fence and like a rumor if you stared too long. He told Tomas not to try to own it. He told him he would fail at not owning it. He told him the trick would be to stop before failure became luxury. Tomas wanted to ask for a history and a rule and received instead a fig and a suggestion to eat it before he inspected it for symbolism.\n\nHis mother insisted on a party when the water went fully away. She called it a party because she knew banquets were for people who wanted to talk about speeches later, and besides, she had no time for speeches when the fish had to be brought out on time. She invited only the people she was prepared to clean up after: her son and his sister and two neighbor ladies who knew where she kept the plates and, without being asked, Lila and Ezra and the locksmith and, because she was wicked in this very particular way, Mira. Mira came and stood in her small kitchen and said nothing that would make gossip later and everything that made it impossible for the hostess to hate her. She ate the fish and the bread and an orange she peeled as if it would be rude to let anyone else do it, and at the door she told the mother the untruth all bosses tell the mothers of their problematic men: He is careful. The mother, who had been told truth and lies enough to curate herself, did not contradict her.\n\nThat night the boy with the scar knocked on Tomas\u2019s door with the expression children wear when they have found a problem they cannot solve without the complicity of someone older who will pretend not to be excited. There was a court under the viaduct where the old men played cards and the young men learned the geometry of trouble, and someone had come with a can of paint and drawn a square that made the shape of the drills into a logo and put a price on it. The boy wanted to know if he should tear it up or charge a tax. Tomas stood in the doorway and examined his pride for the telltale heat of being flattered in the wrong way, and he told the boy he should do both in the right order: tear up the paint with a bucket and three friends, and then leave a price for the men who wanted to sell the circle back to people who had invented it in basements. The price would be to stand very still for a minute and ask someone older for a story that ends without a moral. The boy grinned because he suspected he was being taught to run a game without calling it one, and in that grin Tomas remembered that he had been nineteen once for six long years.\n\nAna\u00efs wrote a letter she did not send. It was addressed to the ball. In it she apologized for the fuss and thanked it for being patient and told it that when she retired she would steal it and take it somewhere with no glass and put it on a table and let children touch it until it no longer mattered what anyone had agreed to tell about it. Then she tore up the letter, because dramatics are like silk\u2014they snag on things and then you are beholden to the snag. She instead wrote a note to a girl who had looked at the crack like a scholar and told her she could have a key to the gallery on mornings when no one else was there if she promised not to be precious about her access. The girl returned with a thank-you written on the back of a grocery list, and this delighted Ana\u00efs enough to carry her through three arguments about stairs needing to be painted.\n\nThere is a season in every city when the weather decides to be gentle while people are trying very hard to be serious, and it makes everyone\u2019s principles look like hats in the wrong wind. They tried anyway. The Glass Choir held forums that framed kindness as a conspiracy and filled their audiences with the sorts of men who enjoy the posture of shame on other people. Mira spoke less and made her face a place where questions went to die. Lila learned a new way to say \u201cmove\u201d with her knees. The locksmith trained an apprentice whose hands were blessedly impatient. Ezra\u2019s wife told him she would not host any more rope in the living room unless it started paying rent. Tomas caught himself one morning rehearsing a speech he would never give and put a spoon in his mouth to shut himself up and went to the bridge and did three quiet things that did not need to be accounted for in anyone\u2019s ledger.\n\nAround the same time, the first person vanished using the thread the bus stop man had shown him. It was an ugly leaving, without oranges or notes. It had no accompanying flood to make the courtesy feel like a response. It looked like a coward\u2019s trick until they found out why\u2014an accountant in a building that made its money off a new category called compliance had decided he did not want to be part of a machine that sold people their own habits with surcharges, and he left his ring on a sink and turned the three taps and thought of a ball hitting a wall and then he was someone else\u2019s problem. He did not come to Tomas or Lila or even to Ana\u00efs; he went to the locksmith, because when you are about to do a foolish, brave thing you look for the person who can fix a hinge and you ask them if you\u2019re crazy and they say yes and then they make you a sandwich. The locksmith made him a ring that would fool a door and told him to come back in three days for the better version, and in those three days the Glass Choir declared a crisis and the city pretended to be surprised, and Mira wrote three sentences that closed a window without looking like it had been there, and the accountant slept very well for the first time since he had been given a password to something that mattered.\n\nTomas and Lila walked once, finally, at an hour when people do not expect men and women to do anything but sleep or sin. They did neither. They walked the long curve of the river that had lately made itself famous, and they told each other five tiny unimportant truths and did not discuss the way they had begun to carry one another\u2019s reflexes. She pointed at a building that used to be a bathhouse and now sold coffee with insufficient apology for charging rent for conversations, and he pointed at a corner where a boy had dropped a ball in a way he would not forget. They did not touch because touching at that hour in that city carries with it a grammar they had not earned and did not want to borrow; they stood at the marker for the flood of twenty years ago and pretended not to do the math for their ages then. When they parted she said, as if it were an inventory item, that she disliked the word brave when applied to men who were doing what ought to have been less interesting. He told her he would consider being boring for a week. They laughed quietly for the sake of the sleeping.\n\nThe city turned a corner without announcing it, and the fact that no one noticed was the proof. Children began to incorporate circles into their play without feeling revolutionary. A market vendor stamped a little orange on the receipts of customers who had taught someone younger how to count change, and the stamp became a thing people compared at parties and then forgot. The Book developed a way to anticipate when someone was about to step on someone else\u2019s heel and gently slowed one of them by showing the weather on a screen for half a breath longer than necessary. The ordinance survived with its italics and its dental work, and the choir kept singing and people bought the pins because pins are pretty whether or not they tell lies. The ball stayed in its case and smiled its crack at cameras, and Ana\u00efs began to say the word retirement out loud in a way that felt like the letter R had been properly sharpened. Mira had a jacket altered so she could raise her arms higher without looking like she intended to hug someone, and she wrote in her yellow pad: permit, audit, forgive, repeat, and put three question marks around the third word because she knew the third word would cost her later.\n\nHe took the hex key from the windowsill on a Thursday and put it in his pocket without the red box because pockets, not boxes, had always been where men have kept their inheritances. On the way to his mother\u2019s he stopped at the bench where the pigeons were braver than men, and he drew a diagram on the back of a flyer for a market that promised artichokes at a price that made farmers laugh, and he showed it to a girl who had lost a tooth that afternoon and was collecting opinions about whether she looked like a pirate. He told her that the problem with respect is that it feels too much like softness and too little like leverage, and she told him she didn\u2019t know those words yet and he told her good, keep it that way for a while. He felt, for the first time since he had put the ring down in a small room with blinking lights, that there might be a version of a city he would be proud to be old in. Then a text arrived from Ezra that said in seven words what men who cannot afford grammar say when their day has turned: They took the shop. With a smile.\n\nThey had come while the locksmith was showing a girl with a braid how to clean the mouth of a lock with a trick that involved patience and an old toothbrush and a respect for mouths. They had brought a paper that had been written by a person who did not know how to carry keys without looking ridiculous. They had asked him questions that were not questions and had smiled each time he answered in a sentence longer than a verdict. They had unplugged his lathe and his little radio with a sigh that told the room it would be better this way. They had found the teapot with the chips and left it because it was a teapot and they were sentimental about households when they were doing things that injured them. They had told him not to leave town in a voice that made clear leaving town would be proof of the wrong thing. They had confiscated his incomplete rings because the law prefers its lies to be finished. They had left the shop looking temporarily larger and used, like a shirt after a dance. The locksmith stood in the doorway with his hands clasped as if at a funeral and told the girl he would finish teaching her to seat a pin in the afternoon somewhere drier.\n\nTomas went home and looked at the developer mode like a man looks at a gun he has promised not to keep loaded, and he did not press the taps because the room had begun to smell of tragedy and he had vowed, to nobodies and to himself, that he would not be the person who brought tragedy into rooms unless tragedy had already arrived uninvited. He put the hex key on the table like a set of intentions he was not yet ready to say out loud and called Lila with the economy that makes colleagues of people who have twice lied to protect each other in compatible ways. She told him to meet her on a corner where the Book\u2019s eyes liked to blink. He brought two oranges and the paper with the diagram and the old toothbrush because it felt funny to carry a weapon that had once been useless. They stood together and watched the light do that trick it likes at that hour, turning everyone into the sort of person you hope you are in better stories, and she said, with a patience she did not like having to use on her own mouth, that the next thing would be crueler and more boring, and that they would need to be good at both refusing and yawning. He told her he had practiced both his whole life without awards. She touched his sleeve with two fingers, a gesture that could not be misread by any camera, and walked away to file a report that would not be read by anyone who mattered and would be found by someone who would think they had discovered a small proof of decency. The oranges sat briefly in his pocket like two suns, and he decided to count that, for now, as a surplus.",
