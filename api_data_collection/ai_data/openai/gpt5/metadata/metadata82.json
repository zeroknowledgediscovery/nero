     "novel_text": "Paris was a city of soot and mirrors, the velvet of dusk stitched with gold stitches where the streetlamps came on one by one along the quays. I lived in the thin places between a window and its reflection. If you pressed your palm to the cold glass of the caf\u00e9 at the corner of Rue des Trois-Fr\u00e8res and peered, perhaps you felt a coolness against your lifeline that wasn\u2019t the weather. That was me, Lorette, small enough to sleep inside a spoon, old enough to remember the sound of horse hooves on the cobbles, restless as dust.\n\nI was a fairy, though the word was always too pretty by half. We weren\u2019t petaled and sugar-lit. We were what happens when a story breathes into stone and the stone says yes. On Montmartre roofs, the chimneys were my organ pipes, I played them with the wind. I kept a nest in the broken hand of a statue, and a second home behind the face of a broken clock in a shop that never closed because time there had lost interest. I loved Paris for its layers, because even a fairy knows loneliness and there is a specific comfort in living where people forget their umbrellas and their lovers and their better selves all in one place, and I, a creature with no umbrella and no lover, could collect what fell.\n\nOn a Tuesday stiff with drizzle, I had flown as low as a newsboy\u2019s shout when it happened. A moth found me. Not a shy butter-colored moth either, but a night-thick creature like a charred scrap of paper that still remembered the words written on it. It sidled into the air beside me, matched my speed without effort.\n\n\u201cWhat have you got in your pocket?\u201d I asked, because sometimes when a moth looks that confident, it isn\u2019t here for crumbs of lamplight.\n\nThe moth didn\u2019t speak, because they rarely oblige, but it twisted, scraped something against the wet underside of a gutter, and a string fell, and then a coiled thing slid from its body like an unspooling secret. A package hung by threads. I hovered, letting it swing in the drizzle. A wax seal held it: a seal that was neither red nor black but a thin, starved white, so pale it almost counted as a color only out of politeness. The seal bore an emblem that hurt the eye, a figure-eight broken open and mended with a thorn. I sniffed it. It smelled like lilac blossoms set on fire and put out at the last moment by rain.\n\n\u201cTo me?\u201d I asked the moth.\n\nIt landed on my shoulder and refused to be questioned further.\n\nMy fingers aren\u2019t like human ones; my bones have opinions. They can widen and narrow as needed, and I have a trick for slipping through the seams of things. The wax looked brittle, felt like the memory of chalk, and when I pressed my nail against it, a tiny sound came out of it as if a lake had cracked somewhere.\n\nInside the paper, letters like iron filings had arranged themselves in a hand I recognized from dreams I did not remember having. Lorette \u00e0 Paris, they began, as if Paris were not the noun but the qualifier.\n\nWe are writing to inform you that you have been accepted at L\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de la Br\u00e8che, School of Thresholds. Term begins at the stroke of midnight on the first night of the new moon, below the west clock of the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay. Bring what you can carry and what you cannot leave.\n\nIt did not say who wrote it. It did not ask me whether I wanted to attend.\n\nThe moth closed its wings and became a suggestion.\n\n\u201cBarely polite,\u201d I told it. \u201cIs this a joke?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t think so. Rarely has a joke burned that cold when I touched it.\n\nI tucked the letter into the lining of my dress. My dress was made from a handkerchief left at P\u00e8re Lachaise where nobody cried the night it was dropped. It had a faint scent of iris and old salt when wet. It was wet now. I laughed once, testing the echo of my own amusement against the clouds, and the laugh came back a little late, as if someone else had preferred to keep it. That too had been happening lately.\n\nThe moth rose, circled me, and left a line in the air like a filament, like a path a child draws to show where to go.\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d I called, and the sound fell against the roof tiles and slid off.\n\nI knew the school. Not like people know it, with glossy brochures and proud parents. Our kind didn\u2019t have parents so much as places. But the Br\u00e8che was a myth you could misplace and find again. A school built on a crack between what breathes and what merely persists. They say it moves. They say it grows legs once a century and wades into the sea, and there are years when a student opens a door to go to class and steps into a storm and graduates six hours later with kelp in their hair.\n\nThe west clock of the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay. At the stroke of midnight. Bring what I could carry. Bring what I could not leave.\n\nI did not think I had a choice.\n\nI fluttered down toward street level, where the human city had gathered its faces behind glass. The broken clock shop was on Rue Dauphine, narrow and long and smelling of onions from the soup simmering in the back and the petrichor of errant memories. The clockmaker was mostly a clock. He lived in his own work, you see. Time had packed itself into his bones as a joke, and then forgot to unpack. His name was Monsieur Val\u00e9rian, and he wore threadbare velvet and a small freckle in the shape of 4:08 at the corner of his mouth.\n\nHe could not always see me. He could sometimes feel me. He called me Mon \u00e9cho, and I accepted the name because his voice held no cruelty. I had stayed in his shop for most of a winter when the snow felt like the softest sort of loneliness and being seen would have been the wrong kind. He left out crumbs and a thimble; he told his clocks to tick softly when I fell asleep behind the gears of a carriage clock.\n\nWhen I pushed the door, the bells shivered, and in three different rooms things chimed the hour, none in agreement. I slid under the shadow of a shelf. We had arranged our languages between us: one part finger-work on lacquered wood, one part tapping the rim of a porcelain cup, one part breath on glass. He was bent over a table, a loupe at his eye. His hair looked like the white fuzz you see on the underside of a dandelion leaf.\n\n\u201cVal\u00e9rian,\u201d I said. I flew close enough that the hairs on his hand lifted, that he felt me as a draft. He lifted his head. His face opened, the way a house opens when you unlatch a shutter.\n\n\u201cMon \u00e9cho,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWhere have you been? It\u2019s raining\u2014ghost rain.\u201d He said the last like a joke and then seemed to dislike how it sounded.\n\nI settled on the edge of a tin of screws. They glittered like fish scales.\n\n\u201cAn invitation came. A moth delivered it, so I can\u2019t return to sender,\u201d I told him. I tapped the tin once, twice, then slid the letter into the light. Humans could not always read our paper, but Val\u00e9rian had some Bone in him. Not like a witch, not like a sorcerer. He was a man who had listened too closely to the ticking inside himself and had found the seam. That will do, if you are patient.\n\nHe pushed the loupe to his forehead and lifted the letter with hands that had made a thousand small decisions and regretted perhaps three.\n\n\u201cAn academy,\u201d he breathed. \u201cI had a cousin who went to the Conservatoire of the Unsaid in Lyon. He died content, and his clocks never lied afterwards.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes. Clocks terrific. Val\u00e9rian, would you miss me?\u201d I asked, too lightly, too quickly. I hadn\u2019t meant to.\n\nHe put his mouth in a firm line that made his freckle at 4:08 disappear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very selfish to miss creatures like you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are a wind. I am a weight. Still.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill,\u201d I echoed.\n\nHe poured tea into the thimble. He understood that I didn\u2019t need the tea. The gesture was the point. He looked at the emblem in the seal. \u201cWhen?\u201d\n\n\u201cNext new moon. Midnight. West clock.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat clock is often wrong,\u201d he said, with an irritation he reserved for public timepieces. \u201cIt runs ahead when it rains.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt always rains,\u201d I said, which was not true, but for us it felt true. He made a noncommittal hum. The steam rose in a column, brushed my knees.\n\n\u201cBe careful with thresholds,\u201d Val\u00e9rian said. \u201cThey always want something in return.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have very little,\u201d I said, and it sounded like a lie, which annoyed me.\n\n\u201cYou have names,\u201d he pointed out without looking at me, which meant he was speaking to me directly. \u201cThe ones you share and the ones that are afraid to be said. That is enough to pay tuition at most schools. Keep one for yourself. And keep the letter. It smells like a warning.\u201d\n\nOn my way down Rue Dauphine, the street stretched. It does that when it wants to be remembered and is afraid it won\u2019t be. I skimmed past a bakery where a child pressed her nose against the glass so hard that the heat made an oval that fogged and bloomed and popped back to clarity; I lined a strip of sugar dust along my forearm because I like how it looks on my skin. I passed a cat who did not see me. This had started recently, the invisibilities. The city and I were forgetting each other in little patches, like moth bites. I told myself that was the season.\n\nAt the Pont Neuf a woman leaned over the stone and did not think about the river. The river thought about her anyway. We all do this, mistake our thoughts for a boundary.\n\n\u201cMadame, don\u2019t\u2014\u201d I called, not expecting an answer. She did not look. The rain ticked against her coat like applause. I was angry with the river for its appetite, its foreverness, as if it had invented eternity and now expected payment for the patent. I flung myself in front of the woman's open mouth. Her breath went through me like a needle through silk. It hurt in a way I could not explain. Something old and thin and light stirred in me, like a moth under a glass cloche.\n\n\u201cMadame,\u201d someone said, and it was a man in a blue scarf, not me, tugging her sleeve, smiling too broadly, as if to make a bridge with his face you could walk over. She blinked, stepped back, and the river pretended it had never been hungry. The man widened his hands, and she laughed at how his scarf had gotten wet. They turned away.\n\nI hung there, in the cold. No one saw me. The bridge gave nothing back. I thought of the emblem on the letter, of the cracked loop mended with a thorn. The crack worried me. The mending worried me more.\n\nAt sunset I went to see Henri at his bookstall on the Quai de la Tournelle. He wasn\u2019t really Henri; he had three names depending who owed him money. But he had always been kind, and the pages of his books had soft corners. He made space for me beneath a pile of Baudelaire with covers like bruises. When I told him about the invitation he nodded as if I\u2019d said something about the weather.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll need a wallet,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had one,\u201d I said. \u201cI carry my coins in my mouth or my hair.\u201d\n\n\u201cNon, a wallet for names. The Br\u00e8che will try to steal the ones you aren\u2019t using that day. Spare names to tuck behind other names like a paper between pages.\u201d He cut a square from a glove someone had left, stitched it with coarse thread, and wrote inside it with a pencil dull as a butter knife. He wrote LORETTE in heavy letters and then below that L. Rette and below that L\u2019Or\u00e9e and on and on until it looked like the way rain writes itself into the river.\n\n\u201cYou make this sound like a habit you should have mentioned earlier,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI am mentioning it now,\u201d he said, with the small smile of a man who knows he is late and makes a parade about it. \u201cYou put the one you use on the outside and tuck the others deep. If you are carried, the deep ones may not wash out. That is the trick. We all live in sausages of tricks; you should know that by now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, sincerely enough that he did not make another joke. His fingers smelled like tobacco and glue. He tucked the wallet into a fold in my dress I didn\u2019t know was there. \u201cTell me about the Br\u00e8che,\u201d I demanded. \u201cNot the brochure. The mouth of it.\u201d\n\nHe tilted his head, squinted at Notre-Dame where the cranes wore the evening like enormous moths. \u201cIt takes children who do not know they are children,\u201d he said, \u201cand it takes old men who aren\u2019t particularly old. It teaches the crossing of places without being torn by either edge. Some students are doors. Some are keys. Some are hands. You\u2014\u201d He looked at me then in that way he almost never did. \u201cYou are a hinge, maybe. Hard to love, necessary, creaky when it rains.\u201d\n\n\u201cCharming,\u201d I said, stung. He nodded. He did not apologize. \u201cAnd the teachers?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will smile and watch your feet. The good ones will warn you when to close your eyes. The bad ones will warn you when to open them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if I do not go?\u201d\n\nHe shrugged. \u201cThen you will stand here some night like this one and feel something pass. It will feel like a train beneath your feet, and you will pretend you are not someone who ever feels trains in the bones, and you will make a joke about weather to a friend who is not that kind of friend, and then you will be angry at yourself for a week with no reason you can mention out loud. I\u2019m a bookseller, mon petit. I live next to a river. I know what it is to see something go and not say wait.\u201d\n\nI had no mother to write to. There was once a tree from which I came, a plane tree in the Square d\u2019Anvers where a boy had carved his initials and forgotten the girl; I remembered her braid. I told the tree. The tree, as trees do, offered shade.\n\nAt dusk, I went to the catacombs because sometimes you must speak to bones, even if you are made of stories and stubbornness. It was a narrow place for small voices who wanted to be larger. I did not bring a light. I had my own. It is nothing you would see, a sort of not-shadow that makes shadows behave. The skulls did not mind my presence. They were bored and gave as all bored things do\u2014by asking questions.\n\n\u201cDo you think you will be different when you come back?\u201d one asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t often come back from things,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThen you aren\u2019t very good at leaving,\u201d another said liltingly, which was unfair, but bones are honest in unfair ways.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m invited to a school,\u201d I told them. \u201cWhere do I put my dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the left,\u201d said a skull with a crack along the eyebrow ridge that looked like a lightning strike. \u201cAlways on the left. The right hand forgets what it has lost quickly, because we spent so many centuries pretending that was honor. The left hand remembers too much. It will give your dead back when you ask, even if it hurts.\u201d\n\nI put my dead on the left, as instructed. I felt lighter and worse.\n\nOn the way out I saw something. It might have been a hallucination. I have those, but they are rarely mine. Something black as a full stop that refused to end a sentence. A shape at the edge of a corridor, a wing that had never touched light and didn't plan to. It was a fairy. Rueful. Elegant the way a knife is elegant. Her eyes were on the catalogues of bones like a librarian who had just realized the shelves could be re-ordered to make night fall at noon.\n\nShe looked at me and smiled, small and courteous, as if we were introduced at a dinner party neither of us wanted to attend.\n\n\u201cAre you the ash-sister?\u201d I asked, before I could stop myself. I had heard the name whispered with a sneer by a spider who darned stockings in an attic on Rue Keller. The ash-sister taught fires to pretend to be frost. The ash-sister collected human wishes and fed them back to humans after they\u2019d gone off, in jars with pretty ribbons.\n\nShe inclined her head. She had no ash on her; perhaps it was inside. \u201cNames are what people say when they cannot afford to speak to the thing itself,\u201d she said. Her voice was white-noise soft; it seemed to come from the space between my heartbeat and the next. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have too many,\u201d I said, and thought of Henri\u2019s stitched wallet, of its scratchy lines like stitches in a wound.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said, as if I were a student who had answered the first lesson correctly. \u201cYou will last longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you hurt them?\u201d I asked, shocking myself with the plainness of it. By them I meant humans. By hurt I meant everything.\n\nHer smile didn\u2019t fade. It changed color somehow. \u201cWe do what is necessary,\u201d she said gently.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s another word for necessary,\u201d I said. \u201cWe both know it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do what is owed,\u201d she corrected. \u201cThe debt has always been there. They invent names for it, but it does not mind what it is called. It is patient.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re patient?\u201d I said, and it came out unsteadily.\n\nShe lifted one shoulder in a shrug that had cost her nothing. \u201cI prefer to be the verb. It feels better in the mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many will you take?\u201d My wings beat hard against my spine. The air did not move. I couldn\u2019t feel my face at all. When I blinked, the darkness was thick enough to fold.\n\n\u201cYou will learn to ask better questions at the Br\u00e8che,\u201d she murmured. \u201cIf you return. In any case, the number is not the interesting part. The shape is. There is a pattern. We all live inside it. You tug one edge, and the whole city shudders. You will see.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee what?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow something dies without ending. How something survives without living.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou speak like a stupid poem,\u201d I snapped, afraid.\n\n\u201cThen I am in the correct city,\u201d the ash-sister said.\n\nI made a small, involuntary motion, like a flinch. She moved with an economy I envied, vanished into a crease in the darkness you would not see even if you looked for it with a hundred eyes. I stood in the humming, old wet quiet, my fingers on my own ribs, counting. One, two, three. My breath made the faintest frost on my skin. I rubbed it away.\n\nWhen I climbed back into the night, Paris had washed itself in lamplight. My letter was a square against my heart, colder than it had any right to be.\n\nThe days narrowed to a point. I pretended they were broad. I did not say goodbye to many. We are bad at endings, we fairies, because we are too good at beginnings. We prefer to pretend one is the other. I left a piece of myself in every place I knew I would miss: a hair woven into the fringe of a lost scarf at the thrift shop; a thumbprint of light on the brass rail in the M\u00e9tro; a sigh on the back steps of the Op\u00e9ra where dancers sat with their stockings rolled down, speaking of their bruises as if they were love letters.\n\nVal\u00e9rian sharpened his sorrow and handed it to me unlabeled. \u201cYou are sure?\u201d he said on the last evening.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I am going.\u201d He nodded as if I had given the correct password. He gave me a pin shaped like a pin, the simplest of charms. \u201cIf a door looks like a person, prick them first,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they bleed, the door is elsewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be foolish,\u201d I promised, and we both knew I would.\n\nHenri pressed a book the size of a fingernail into my hand, a dictionary of sighs. \u201cWords you can keep. Sighs are lonelier. They get into cracks nobody intends,\u201d he said. \u201cThis one is for when your own won\u2019t do.\"\n\nI made a pile on the edge of the west clock of the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay. I had come hours too early, and the glass bulged like a watch-crystal, the city a dial. I could see the river unspooling itself, a ribbon with mud on it. Tourists in the museum ate pastries in the caf\u00e9 under the clock without looking up; their faces were lanterns in a garden that had never known wind. It is very tiring, that sort of light.\n\nI had brought what I could carry: the thimble, which was a home; the pin, which was a weapon that wouldn\u2019t pretend to be something else; the dictionary; Henri\u2019s wallet of names. I had brought my shame also, rolled small enough to hide behind my left ear because the bones had told me to keep the left hand for memory. I had not brought the feeling I had every morning when I looked down from the roof and thought I could see myself walking along the street below, small and sure, because that feeling hadn\u2019t come back since the letter.\n\nMidnight is a rumor. It is never really a point; it is a neighborhood. The clock stretched toward it, and the rain began again, as if the weather believed itself to be a measure of devotion. If you have waited wisely, you know when a moment is arriving; the air gets a fibrous quality, as if you could tear it and see threads. I stood on the lip of the gargoyle\u2019s mouth, under a slate line of roof, wind at my back. The west clock sang its time with the erroneous pride of public timepieces. A low, second sound answered from within the gears, a note older than bells.\n\nA figure stepped from behind the time. She wore a coat that almost admitted to being a coat and boots that had never been on ground. Her hair was the color of old wheat or old books\u2014things left in the sun. Her face was unpunctuated.\n\n\u201cLorette,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d She flicked her gaze to the small pile of my belongings. \u201cThose will do. You are also wearing your dead properly. Not everyone listens.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a hinge,\u201d I blurted, halfway between protest and pride. I wanted to see whether she would smile the way Henri had not. She did not. She looked at me as if I had said the word spoon.\n\n\u201cWe will teach you to turn,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will teach you not to be broken by it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you\u2014\u201d I began, and did not finish. Teacher? Door? Judgement? She lifted one hand, and her eyes were not kind, but they were exact.\n\n\u201cIf we name ourselves at the border, the border takes its percentage,\u201d she said. \u201cWalk.\u201d\n\nThe glass of the clock should have been cold. It felt not at all. The numbers flipped from gilt to absence. The rain stopped or we stepped between rains. The frame of the clock expanded like a chest drawing breath.\n\nI thought of Val\u00e9rian\u2019s ankles. Their bones looked like the bones of birds sometimes when he leaned against a stool and I had to leave the room because the urge came strong to hide in his sleeve. I thought of the woman on the bridge and her mouth making questions that the river thought were answers. I thought of the ash-sister standing politely among the anonymous; she is patient, she said. She was a noun; she made herself a verb. I tried to think of nothing, because the letter had smelled like a warning and Henri had warned me about teachers who told you when to open your eyes.\n\nThe glass did not break. It slipped. There was only the weight of my thimble and the dictionary and the pin and the names pressing against my ribs, making a bouquet of small pains. I stepped. A second step. The second step was the same as the first. The third was not. The third step was one of those steps that redraw you. I felt it then, a sudden falling, the opposite of flight, a reverse idea of wings. I was not frightened. The feeling was old.\n\n\u201cDo not look for yourself,\u201d the woman said. \u201cYou won\u2019t like where you find you.\u201d A cruel thing to say. Perhaps necessary.\n\nI did not look. I tried not to look. The gears turned around us, a patient circle, and the threads of midnight twined and tied, a neat knot, a cheap bow. In the tightness, a memory slanted across me like a shadow thrown by a bird you cannot see; something about the taste of rain from a particular year; something about the sapphired glass of an ambulance; something about a gentleman\u2019s hand, bleeding, inexplicably, by the mouth of a metro.\n\nI shrank inside my skin so quickly that my bones made the sound of a fault line cracking. I smelled lilac and ash. The emblem in the seal of my letter burned against my ribs through fabric, through the paper, through skin, as if it had hands. I gritted my teeth, and on their edge I felt grit.\n\n\u201cWalk,\u201d the woman said again, and I did, because thresholds always wanted something, and perhaps what they wanted was compliance like this, small and vicious and honest.\n\nWe came into a place that was not the museum. The world hiccuped. Air resumed around us. I know I was in a room because sound behaved, because light had edges, because I could feel the subtle insistence of a ceiling. The woman took my thimble, set it on a table, left my pin and my book and my names alone, which I admired her for. The thimble looked as humble as ever, but it had never been that small before. Everything had changed another way, again.\n\n\u201cWhat do I call you?\u201d I asked, because I did not want to think my thoughts out loud where they could trip me.\n\n\u201cMa\u00eetresse d\u2019Entr\u00e9e,\u201d she said, with a faintness of smile that could have been politeness or disdain, and then she gave me a small square of cloth. It smelled like an attic. \u201cHere. Hold this when they ask you to give something up. It is nothing. It may pass.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if it doesn\u2019t?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you get to decide what matters,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will not be the last time.\"\n\nStudents stirred at the edges of the room. The children Henri had spoken of, who did not know they were children yet. A boy with eyelashes like broom bristles. A girl whose hands were too big for her body. Something that was a girl and a tower at once, with chips of sky in her hair. And others, older in the way one kind is older under another kind of age, faces that had learned to claim their own shadows. They did not look at me long. They were busy with their own thresholds.\n\nI could not help it. I looked down. I had thought my feet would be there. They were, of course\u2014you couldn\u2019t make do otherwise\u2014but they had no weight. They made no sound. When I pressed my heel into the floor, there was the tiniest give and then nothing. I laughed because I did not want to cry. The laugh came back to me on a delay, out of tune, as if someone else had laughed in my throat just before me. The Ma\u00eetresse\u2019s eyes flicked, quick as a pin.\n\n\u201cWe will give you a bed,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t sleep,\u201d I said, automatically.\n\n\u201cThen you will learn how not to sleep among those who do. There is magic in that, too,\u201d she said, and her hand, in a gesture almost gentle, almost not, touched my shoulder and found me solid, or she pretended to. Perhaps she pretended for me. Perhaps for herself.\n\n\u201cIs there someone here called ash-sister?\u201d I asked in a voice fixed to unsmiling.\n\nThis time she did smile, briefly, as if the question were a coin she expected and had taught herself to be pleased by. \u201cWe do not call her that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe call her what she insists she refuses to be, which I will not tell you. It is the only revenge we offer our teachers. Put your book and your names beneath your pillow. Do not sleep facing the window the first night. If you hear the sea, you may be in the wrong building.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt moves?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe Br\u00e8che?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt moves, and it is moved,\u201d she said. \u201cWe examine the cracks. We do not seal them. There are schools for sealing. You will not be happy there.\u201d Her eyes suggested she knew what she was talking about.\n\nPeople filed through. Voices rose. Someone cried in a language without vowels. Someone giggled and covered their mouth and then her hands for a moment were not hands. I went where they told me, past a series of doors that are not worth cataloguing because they were not the kind you could find twice.\n\nThe bed they gave me was a shelf in a library of doors whose spines had titles like When She Chose the Vase and The Dress Was Gold and The Door You Do Not Open. It suited me. My thimble fit in the corner like a stubborn grief. I placed the dictionary underneath my pillow and the names above my head. I pretended to pull a blanket over me; it was more for their comfort than mine. I inspected my edges the way you look for splinters after doing something stupid, a hammer maybe, a ladder.\n\nSomewhere, someone sang. The song had incorrect words and a perfect tune. It hurt in the way a memory that is not yours hurts when it recognizes you.\n\nI tried not to think about my third step on the clock and how familiar the fall had felt. I tried not to think about the ash-sister saying we do what is owed. I tried not to think of thresholds and their dinners. The Ma\u00eetresse had told me to hold the square of cloth when asked to give something up. I held it now as a rehearsal. It smelled of dust and apples. It was nothing. It was something.\n\nI closed my eyes because she had told me not to. On my left I kept my dead. On my right, the names. My head floated a little above my pillow, as it sometimes does. I listened to the breathing of those who slept. It is important to admit what to envy. I envied them. Quietly.\n\nParis stayed outside, but I could hear it, a faint percussion through the bricks, as if the city had become a drum you could hold against your ear, and the river a heartbeat that does not remember to stop, which is lucky for so many. The academy sighed and settled, old timbers talking to old stone. I thought I could still smell lilacs and something burnt.\n\nI counted my breaths not to sleep, but to watch time behave. One, two, three, four. At four I remembered a street crossing with no traffic and a car that did not appear because there was never such a car; at seven I remembered a light turning green and a woman waiting under the awning of a flower shop; at nine I remembered fog. The remembering had peculiar teeth. I let it bite. It was maybe my first lesson.\n\nIn the dark a whisper played itself like a closing hand. A voice on the crack of hearing, not the ash-sister\u2019s, not the Ma\u00eetresse\u2019s, something with a patience longer than naming. It said: stay on the left. It said: bring what you cannot leave.\n\nI held my breath, a small disobedience. I opened my eyes. I expected my darkness. There was a slant of something like moon. I reached out and my fingers passed through my own shadow. It is nothing, I thought, which is not true. But you can live quite a long time on things that are not true, if the city loves you and you love it back. I folded my hand. I put it on my ribs. I felt the thump. For now. For now, I thought, for now, for now, as if repeating it would make it less of a promise you cannot keep.In the morning the Br\u00e8che pretended to be ordinary, which was one of its best tricks. A bell rang that was not a bell but the shared intake of breath of a hundred doorframes. Light patted the walls like a host making sure the furniture had not moved in the night. I lay on my shelf and listened to wood remember it had been a tree and to stone remember it had been a river and to my own ribs remember they had once not needed names. Sleep had not come, but I had kept it company from nearby; that counts, I am told. When I sat up, the dictionary slid and sighed under my hand with the polite dismay of a book that had not expected to be useful so soon. My names were still there. I checked them with the anxious efficiency of someone who has already lost something once that morning and refuses to say it out loud.\n\nA girl who had slept two doors down blinked at me with the guileless stare of someone who had not yet picked an age and was trying on several. Her hair was the color of worn coins, and her hands were too big in a way that suggested intention rather than error, as if they were practicing for a version of her future where she would hold more than seemed decent. \u201cAre you new?\u201d she asked, and then made a face, because everyone here was new, always, each hallway pretending to be another and winning.\n\n\u201cI am chapter two,\u201d I said, unhelpfully, because that is what the morning felt like. She laughed in the way of a child who has learned that laughter is a form of currency and spends it when she doesn\u2019t want to answer a question. \u201cI\u2019m called Lorette,\u201d I added, because civility keeps you from slipping too quickly, and gave her a name from the outside of Henri\u2019s wallet.\n\nShe rolled my name in her mouth as if testing a pebble for smoothness. \u201cThey called me Estelle,\u201d she said, with the same sideways emphasis. \u201cI\u2019m practicing. My mother wanted to call me Stone. She had a sense of humor.\u201d She held up one oversized palm, and the lines down it were thick as ropes. The smell of chalk dust and rain came off her, as if she had slept under a staircase.\n\n\u201cWe should go where the bell wants,\u201d I said, and we went, because that is also a trick: walking when something calls you without asking how it knows your address.\n\nThe refectory pretended to be a kitchen inside a train station that had never had trains, which I liked very much. The tables were long and narrow and had scratches that made constellations if you tipped your head. The food was what you expect from a school that interrogates thresholds: slices of bread with the crusts on and off simultaneously; honey that refused to drip until someone told a truth; tea that tasted like weather. I sipped the weather and felt last night\u2019s rain kiss me again and then pull back in embarrassment. A boy with eyelashes like small broom bristles and a bruise of ink on his thumb swore at his cup under his breath in a language that involved a great deal of air. \u201cIf it will not pour, you must name it,\u201d a woman said kindly as she set down a plate that might have contained pears and might have contained the memory of pears. \u201cThe tea, not your anger. Anger hates being named before breakfast.\u201d She smiled, and I did not trust her at all because her smile had the seamed precision of upholstery. \u201cI am Madame Panse,\u201d she added. \u201cI will feed you. I will never feed you twice the same thing. You will forgive this or you will not; it will not change my menu.\u201d\n\nThere was a lecture in a stairwell because sometimes steps teach you better than chairs. We sat and stood and leaned and pretended the handrail was not a serpent. The Ma\u00eetresse d\u2019Entr\u00e9e looked precisely the way she had the night before, which for once reassured me; change is easier when you can point at what did not. She spoke without raising her voice, and yet her words did not lose their edges in the treads. \u201cYou will learn to cross,\u201d she said, as if stating arithmetic. \u201cNot because it is noble, but because it is necessary. I will not flatter you with destiny; we have none to sell. There are other schools where they bind you with prophecy and then charge tuition for the rope. We do work. Sometimes you will like it. Sometimes it will like you. I recommend you not count on either.\u201d\n\nShe had us hold out our hands. \u201cLeft,\u201d she said, and a few of the children made the wrong choice because children do. Her gaze did not soften; she repeated herself until each left hand sat cupped like an offering. \u201cThis is where you keep what you can\u2019t leave. You will find it fills quickly. Do not confuse what you cannot leave with what you ought not take. There are differences. Sometimes they are not big. You will learn to tell them with your eyes closed.\u201d\n\nShe passed between us and laid on each palm a weight you could not see. It made my bones ring. Estelle hissed and then hid her hiss behind her teeth as if embarrassed by its sincerity. The boy with the ink bruise swallowed and then swallowed again, and I watched the swallow push down his throat like a coin in a vending machine. When the Ma\u00eetresse reached me, her fingers touched the place where my lifeline used to be before it ran away into other people\u2019s stories. The weight she put there recognized me, like a scent you know from a past where you had a different voice. It wasn\u2019t grief, though it knew grief\u2019s shoes. It wasn\u2019t obligation, though it had obligation\u2019s posture. It was perhaps the habit of being a hinge. It sat and waited to be turned.\n\n\u201cIn your right,\u201d she said after a heartbeat, \u201cyou will keep what can be given.\u201d She smiled then at one of the doors that had chosen to be a door today. \u201cYou will run out faster. This is ordinary. Do not dramatize it. You are not starving because you cannot give something up; you are starving because you keep trying to feed your debts caramel.\u201d\n\nShe made us walk. Not far. The first lesson was to take a step without carrying the room with you. I found I had always failed at this; I was constantly dragging lint and eye-corners and breath-echoes behind me. \u201cYou are not a net,\u201d she said when she saw me watch my own trail, and then relented and added, \u201cYou are a hinge. The door is the net.\u201d The word hinge lived in her mouth as if she thought it unromantic, which I appreciated like a glass of water with no flowers in it.\n\nAfter the stairwell, there was a class in a hallway where each doorknob had a different temperature and several of them had opinions. A man who introduced himself as M. Chemin wrote a figure-eight on the air with a piece of chalk and then opened its middle like a purse. \u201cThis is the school\u2019s map,\u201d he said, simply, and that seemed honest. The emblem from my letter flickered in the loop. He pinched the break in the eight very gently. \u201cYou do not mend a crack by forgetting it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou do not leave it screaming, either. You stitch. You expect tenderness from neither thread nor skin. Those of you who have only ever been threads will find this frustrating. Those of you who have only ever been skin will find it unfair. Good. Fairness is a myth we invented to hide debt.\u201d\n\nHe saw how I watched, and he nodded at me as if to say yes, you were invited for a reason you will not like. Estelle\u2019s hand crept into mine with the speed of hail. I did not pull away. \u201cWe are going to the city today,\u201d M. Chemin added, casual in the manner of doctors announcing minor surgeries. \u201cPairs of two and threes. You will find a threshold and you will ask for its name, and when it asks for your price, you will pay with something you did not bring. If you cannot pay, you will borrow carefully. If you cannot borrow carefully, you will return and apologize. There is no shame in apologies, only hunger.\u201d\n\nAt the word city my heart did what birds do when a slate roof is lifted in the morning. The Br\u00e8che was not not in Paris, but it was a kind of parallel sentence; it had meaning in common with the city but not all its verbs. The thought of the street shook me like a bell. I saw Val\u00e9rian\u2019s hands on the inside of my eyelids, sorting small screws with the reverence some men reserve for prayers and others for pockets; I smelled the glue on Henri\u2019s fingers, which always made me think of fathers even though I had never had one and had borrowed the idea from a child who had cried at his bookstall one afternoon all spring; I heard the river make its worst argument.\n\nThe ash-sister walked through us as if we were smoke and sat in the first row with the poise of a queen who had no kingdom and no need of one. She wore a dress the color of unripe plums and a coat that would not admit to being seen by anyone born. \u201cYou will not be subtle,\u201d she said lightly, as if complimenting us. \u201cYou are all too new to be elegant. That is fine. Never mistake hiddenness for finesse. Nine out of ten locks prefer a bold key that admits its teeth.\u201d Her gaze fell on me with the polite weight of a boot on a moth. \u201cHinge,\u201d she said, and made it sound like both a profession and an insult. \u201cWho taught you to keep your laughter on a leash?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one did,\u201d I said before my caution could sit me down. \u201cIt learned.\u201d\n\n\u201cLaughter does not learn,\u201d she murmured. \u201cIt breeds. Keep it from the right-hand pocket unless you are making change.\u201d She lifted a paper-wrapped packet from a pocket I could not see. \u201cHomework,\u201d she said, and handed us each a scrap of folded something that did not feel like paper. Mine was cool and soft, like skin that had forgotten about bodies. \u201cReturn these with a threshold\u2019s true name wrapped inside. If it smells of your own hands when you hand it back, you have failed. If it smells of iron when wet, you have misunderstood the lesson. If it smells of sugar, we will send you to Lyon, where they make sweets of unsaid things and choke on them. If it smells like not-quite-rain, I will know you paid.\u201d\n\nEstelle and I and the boy of eyelashes were sent as a three. He told us his name as if confessing a crime. \u201cI am Dryden,\u201d he said, and offered two letters like a spare key. \u201cNot from here. From the reservoir between here and there. It is worse in summer.\u201d His eyelashes trembled as if on their own schedule. When he held the folded scrap to his mouth it darkened a shade, then paled again, as if practicing.\n\nThe Br\u00e8che released us into a courtyard that was not on any map and yet found its own way to a street I recognized. We pressed between the second and third ribs of a wrought iron gate, and there was Rue de Lille, minding its own lies. The sky had the hard brightness of a mirror when you do not want to see yourself. People flowed. Cars paused the way cats do when they realize they have been witnessed doing anything earnest. The museum wore its clocks with continental indifference. Paris smelled like rain and cigarettes and the ghost left by someone who had eaten an orange nearby two hours ago and then thought better of winter.\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d Estelle whispered, and I almost laughed because the question was infinite and the city does not like to be narrowed by whispering. \u201cWhere is a threshold?\u201d she amended, correcting herself, as all good students do, and Dryden pointed at everything. Doorsteps. The lip of the curb. The edge of a puddle where water pretended to be deeper than it had any right. The border where caf\u00e9 light stops because shadows said please. The seam in a wall where plaster had cracked and a spider had signed its name right over the wound.\n\nWe tried the caf\u00e9, not because it was easy but because difficulty often sits under striped awnings and pretends to be expensive. The door had a bell with a ring that sounded like the last coin in a pocket. I hovered an inch from its hinges and whispered, \u201cWhat name do you answer to when nobody is looking?\u201d The door considered. It considered so long that Dryden began to hum, as if to keep time from taking offense. Estelle laid her big hand on the wood, left fingers splayed, right like an apology. The door laughed. It was not unkind, but it was a laugh for a different joke. \u201cYou ask like a window,\u201d it said, and the ash-sister would have been pleased by the precision. \u201cCome back when you have learned boredom.\u201d We backed away, chastened and a little grateful. Doors that answer too readily are usually either generous or hungry, and both charge interest.\n\nOn Rue Jacob a woman with a braid like a rope of pretenses sat on a step crying in that tidy way of women who do not intend to inconvenience anyone and therefore produce the most inconvenient sadness. Her handbag hurt my eyes. It had cost a promise. The step under her held three centuries of feet and wine and fatigue. It was low and strong and had lichen in the corner like unspoken interruptions. I bent so close my breath fogged the thin strip of shadow where the riser met the tread. \u201cHow do you call yourself,\u201d I breathed, \u201cwhen nobody is looking at you and everybody walks on you for years and then they repaint you and pretend you are new?\u201d The step exhaled. \u201cI am called Not Worth It,\u201d it said, and the bitterness was old and deserved. \u201cBut when the house is listening, I am called Come Home.\u201d\n\nEstelle\u2019s eyes widened. Dryden eased his folded scrap open. It looked like a tongue and a blindfold at once. I laid it on the step and held it there with the bare skin of my palm. The step stirred. It asked the question all thresholds know to ask: \u201cWhat do you pay?\u201d Estelle reached for her pocket. Dryden reached for his own name. I remembered the square of cloth the Ma\u00eetresse had given me and felt the slyness move in my wrist. The step would not be cheated. But sometimes you are allowed to confuse it gently.\n\nI held the square, nothing in it, everything of it, and I thought of my laugh that came back wrong and of the smell of lilacs that had almost burned and of the river failing to pretend it wasn\u2019t greedy. I had very little worth paying that wasn\u2019t a lie. So I paid time. A sliver. Not the time I would miss; the time that knits yourself to a place when you let your breath match a stranger\u2019s breath for one beat and then tell yourself you haven\u2019t. It is an unethical coin, and I would not recommend using it. The step shivered. It took it. A cold skittered along my left hand, and my dead moved over to make room for yet another thing I would have to remember.\n\nThe folded scrap drank the name. It became damp with it in the way paper gets damp when it knows a secret that does not belong to it. Dryden wrinkled his nose at the smell. Not sugar. Not iron. Something like rain that had changed its mind halfway down. \u201cEnough,\u201d the step said, dignified as a gentleman who has been offered poor tea and accepts it for the sake of conversation. The woman with the braid blew her nose and stood up straighter without knowing why. Her handbag frowned. Estelle stroked the edge of the tread with the side of her thumb, the way you comfort a dog. We left because we could.\n\nWe moved like people who had earned something and were suspicious of it. Thresholds find this alluring. They opened themselves all down the street with the casual indecency of cabaret dancers. We pretended not to notice. Dryden sang under his breath a song about water pretending to be patient. We should not have been surprised when we met hunger.\n\nAt the corner of Rue des Saints-P\u00e8res and a street that preferred not to tell me its name, the world snagged. A revolving door spun too fast and then not fast enough, and a girl flung her palms against its glass and miscounted her own fingers. It was such a small mistake; it is always the small ones. The door peeled her shadow off like tape. She shrieked in the way of a creature being turned into a vocabulary she did not speak. Her mother said the wrong thing and then the right thing in the wrong order. The door grinned. A man inside it thrust forward with a bouquet that had been expensive and now looked like bad news. The ash-sister stepped out from the shadow of a delivery truck, and the streetlight bent, and the river laughed three blocks away because it laughs at anything that moves.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said before my thinking could explain to the rest of me that I had no tools. The ash-sister\u2019s head tilted not to me but to the city, like she was listening through the asphalt for a subway that would pass in an hour. \u201cIt is owed,\u201d she said softly, not kind, not unkind. Her eyes met mine and held, and I felt the emblem under my dress press its broken loop into my skin as if the thorn would prefer to be a needle.\n\nI threw my square of cloth at her. It was the stupidest possible thing, and I did it because I am a hinge and hinges sometimes snap with grace. She caught it reflexively. Her fingers closed. The cloth behaved, which was to say it pretended to be nothing and then it was. The ash-sister\u2019s mouth made a shape like annoyance and then like approval and then like hunger again. Estelle pushed her hand between the door and the frame and let the door take the dead skin at the side of her thumb as tax. Dryden put his forehead on the glass and called it the wrong name and then the right one and then laughed in the way the ash-sister had warned me not to use, and the door hiccuped and stuttered and then, like all machines with too many eyes on them, decided it wanted to be moderate.\n\nThe girl stumbled, sobbing, into her mother\u2019s lap. They both looked at the bouquet as if it had done all of this by itself. The man pressed a lily at the door for luck and left the city\u2019s grief on the glass where someone else would shoulder it later. The ash-sister folded my nothing square and tucked it in her sleeve as if it had always belonged there. \u201cI will return it with interest,\u201d she said, and I believed her, which is the kind of mistake you think is strength.\n\nWe collected ourselves. Estelle sucked at the blood on her thumb with just anger. Dryden squeezed his folded scrap and grimaced at the smell, which had gone from almost-rain to the sound of a coin dropped in a fountain after the wish was already spent. We walked until our feet forgave us for trying to be brave. M. Chemin had told us not to be subtle, and we had obeyed, and the city had noticed, which it did not mind. It minds being ignored more than anything. It took our attention and turned it into work, as cities do.\n\nI veered toward Rue Dauphine without telling the others and without telling myself I was disobeying any instruction. The clock shop was open because it didn\u2019t close. It never closed. Time had no manners. The bell on the door made three different sounds. Val\u00e9rian looked up with a face that let its hope be seen and then pretended it had not. \u201cMon \u00e9cho,\u201d he said, and the freckle at 4:08 near his mouth made its case for permanence.\n\n\u201cI brought you nothing,\u201d I said, because sometimes accuracy is clearest when it sounds like a joke. Estelle hung back with the respect of a child who has walked into a chapel by accident and is trying to behave in case God is present and bored. Dryden pretended to read a clock made from a pheasant\u2019s spine.\n\n\u201cYou never bring me nothing,\u201d Val\u00e9rian said, and the sentence had two meanings and both were true. He saw my folded scrap and my names and the thinness of my left hand. \u201cIt has started, then,\u201d he added, voice mild, as if discussing the weather, which was precisely the kind of thing he would do to avoid admitting he was frightened on my behalf.\n\n\u201cIt smells of a step,\u201d I said, and handed him the homework because my hands were shaking and I did not want to drop obligation on the floor. \u201cIt asked for time,\u201d I admitted, and he sighed without opening his mouth because he used his sighs carefully and did not waste them on air that did not deserve them. He poured tea into the thimble he had kept for me. It tasted like re-labeled rain. \u201cYou have blood on your thumb,\u201d he told Estelle, who flushed with pride as if she had been publicly praised for competence. \u201cAnd iron under your tongue,\u201d he told Dryden, who looked offended and then amused, which is better for a boy who has lived near reservoirs.\n\nI did not say I had thrown the cloth at the ash-sister. Val\u00e9rian looked at me anyway like a clock that has decided to be honest about its minutes. \u201cYou threw the wrong thing,\u201d he said gently. \u201cBut wrong things sometimes get to the right place.\u201d He put a little screw on the counter and the screw cast a shadow that looked like a bird. \u201cThere is a current,\u201d he said to the room, not to me, or to me but at a distance so I could pretend not to hear if I needed to. \u201cThe Br\u00e8che is not the only school that has rediscovered appetite. Be careful with teachers who cannot distinguish between teaching and feeding. Those are old verbs; they dress alike at night.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you miss me?\u201d I said; I had not meant to; the question was an itch I scratched in public. He made a face as if someone had poured sugar in his tea and he wanted to be grateful and could not. \u201cI miss you in the way a clock misses being wound,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does not want the hand. It does not want the pressure. It wants the purpose and then calls the pressure purpose to be polite. Go do your work. Come back when you can. If the Br\u00e8che moves, I will find it by tapping the bones in my ankle that still want to be gears.\u201d\n\nEstelle touched a stack of faces without glass and shivered. Dryden coerced a cuckoo into revealing how it felt about its job. The answer was obscene and scholarly. We left with less than we had brought and more than we intended, which is a sign of success in any errand worth doing.\n\nWhen we returned to the Br\u00e8che, M. Chemin caught our packets not with his hands but with the habit of having been handed things. He sniffed and smiled with one side of his mouth. \u201cCome Home,\u201d he read under his breath, and the words softened him like wetness softens bread. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, and to Dryden he said, \u201cWe will fix your habit of paying with iron; you are not a gate,\u201d and to Estelle he said, \u201cDo not be brave with flesh if you can be brave with pride; pride bleeds slower.\u201d He looked at me last and long. \u201cYou gave something you did not have to give,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not mistake generosity for payment. You will be poor if you cannot tell the difference.\u201d\n\nThe ash-sister stood at his shoulder and did not look at me, which was a performance, and I admired its form. She smelled of lavender that had been warned. \u201cYou have my nothing,\u201d I told her, because I knew better and because knowledge had never stopped me. \u201cKeep it until you need to forget something and then give it back and call us even.\u201d She finally deigned to smile directly at me, a flash of teeth that told me nothing and promised less. \u201cFair,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd impossible.\u201d She turned away with the economy of someone whose movements are measured by a metronome other people cannot hear.\n\nEvening in the Br\u00e8che was when the building scattered itself and then reconvened, like a family that has learned how to part without making it mournful. The library of doors took a deep breath. The refectory adjusted its chairs so that enemies would sit with their backs together and call it compromise. A window practiced fogging and not fogging and chose fog. I lay on my shelf and pretended to sleep because I had been taught the importance of playacting, and because the lesson moved best if you made space for it. From the hallway came the sound of someone reciting multiplication tables and crying as if numbers were the offense they had always secretly suspected, and from somewhere below came the thin, persistent singing of pipes that had learned to be chimneys and had not forgotten their first love.\n\nI held the square the Ma\u00eetresse had given me earlier, not the one I had thrown; it still smelled like an attic and a fruit I could not name. I held it and tried to think of what I would refuse to give if asked properly and paid the right compliments. The list was shorter than it should have been. Perhaps that was goodness; perhaps that was poverty. I put my dead on the left and my names on the right and told myself jokes about weather that would be funny to no one in this building. The joke still kept its shape in my mouth. That was a kind of luck.\n\nAt some hour that was between the hours the Br\u00e8che recognizes, there was a noise that made my knuckles ache. It was not a bell. It was a practice. Students rose wherever they had fallen asleep and made faces at one another to disguise their fear. \u201cFieldwork,\u201d someone said. \u201cMidnight,\u201d someone else said. \u201cSea,\u201d another voice said, and I closed my eyes because the Ma\u00eetresse had told me to when it came to the sea and because I had disobeyed her once already today and that seemed enough even for me. I did not look. I did not listen. I counted to four. At four I remembered the light from the ambulance that time that wasn\u2019t mine but which I always found in the blue of shutters. At seven I remembered lilacs and ash. At nine I remembered the thin white seal and felt it press between my ribs like a nail you swallow to show off and then regret even before it hurts.\n\nThe Br\u00e8che moved. It does it with the courtesy of a cat deciding to forgive you for nothing. The timbers told the stone their favorite word and the stone whispered it to the windows and the windows put it in their mouths and passed it on. We slid. The smell of salt arrived through the vents like a rumor that had paid for passage. Estelle\u2019s hand found mine in the dark and stayed there in the brazen way of a child who has not been taught to ask and therefore knows how to take what she needs. Dryden sang under his breath a line about not drowning if nobody learns your name for it. Above us, or below, or inside, a woman laughed, and it was a good laugh, the kind that suggests kindness rather than triumph.\n\nThe Ma\u00eetresse\u2019s voice spoke from the place where walls meet ceiling and forget whose job it is to bear the weight. \u201cKeep your lefts,\u201d she said. \u201cUse your rights. Do not pay with what you will miss in the morning. If you see yourself, do not say hello. She does not want to meet you, and you will not like her greeting. If you are asked a question and you cannot tell whether it deserves an answer, put a name in your mouth and do not speak it. The shape will hold you.\u201d\n\nI held a name like a lozenge. I chose L\u2019Or\u00e9e, which is our word for the edge of a forest and also for the place where stories start. It tasted like sap and cheap wine and a kiss under a bridge that did not happen and did not forget to charge my heart for its absence. The building sighed. The sea put its shoulder against our door. The night admired itself in the glass and the glass pretended not to notice. I thought of the step on Rue Jacob and its two names, and I thought of the ash-sister, noun and verb, and I thought of Val\u00e9rian\u2019s ankles and the way love makes you want to live inside someone\u2019s sleeve and then calls it something else so you can be proud of yourself while you hide.\n\nMorning would come again. It always does, even in schools that keep different clocks. I would learn to turn without breaking. They had promised that and had not promised to be kind. I was built for that sort of oath. On my left, the dead rustled politely, making room for what I would collect and forget to lay down. On my right, my names slept like cats, ignoring me with their faces while pinning my legs with their weight. Paris breathed beyond the walls like a creature that would not admit to being a creature. The river did not apologize for wanting. The school did not apologize for teaching. The ash-sister did not apologize for anything. I slept, finally, and woke twice without realizing it either time, and when I woke a third time there was a shell on my pillow where no one had put a shell, and inside it I could hear someone counting, and the numbers were wrong in a way that made me feel almost safe.The shell was the size of a thumbnail and shaped like a question that had learned to sleep on its side. When I lifted it, it made the faint crackle of paper that has been folded too long and forgotten in a pocket woven for a smaller coat. Inside, someone counted stubbornly, a string of numbers with their buttons misbuttoned, marching with the brave incompetence of a parade that did not know which end of the street was the start. I held it to my left ear because the left knows what to do with debt, and the numbers made sense in a way that did not correspond to the calendar. Estelle appeared in the doorway and blinked at the sight of me listening to a shell that had no business having found me, and her face smoothed into relief at the strangeness because ordinary mornings are the enemy of places like this. \u201cDoes it say your name?\u201d she asked, and I almost lied and said yes just to see what would look back at her out of her own certainty, but the shell\u2019s whisper was not a name; it was a tide. Dryden hovered behind her, eyelashes fretting, and leaned forward until the shell took his breath and made a ledger of it. He shuddered and said, with the outrage of a boy whose reservoirs had been insulted, that the counting was wrong on purpose.\n\nThe Ma\u00eetresse d\u2019Entr\u00e9e rang no bell and yet the building obeyed the idea of one, loosening its corners and then pulling them tight. In the stairwell that taught better than chairs, she told us that the Br\u00e8che had nosed against water in the night and intended to use what it found. She did not say sea as if it were an invitation; she said it like a boundary that would pretend to be a friend long enough to make you polite. \u201cYou will keep your lefts,\u201d she said, and made us hold our hands up until we could tell the difference without peeking, \u201cand you will learn the arithmetic of edges that do not stay where they are put. The shell is a summons, not a souvenir. You will treat it with the respect you reserve for doors that laugh at you.\u201d The ash-sister leaned on a banister two steps above us as if she had grown there, her coat doing its refusal to be witnessed, and she smiled with the thoughtless patience of a knife that assumes bread will continue to present itself. A man with hair the color of salt-spray and a face that had been carved by a chisel that liked to work slowly introduced himself as Ma\u00eetre Sel, and I believed him because his mouth was the mouth of someone who swallowed thirst for a living. He told us that the sea asks for price in currencies we mistake for generosity. \u201cYou pay with thirst,\u201d he said pleasantly. \u201cYou pay with direction. If you pay with pride, you will walk in circles until your bones forgive you.\u201d\n\nWe were given lengths of dried kelp braided with twine that had once tied up packages of undelivered letters, and we were told to wear them like ridiculous necklaces. Madame Panse handed us cups of something that tasted exactly like low tide at noon in a year you did not like, and when several of the children made the faces people make when encountering truth in broth, she clucked and told them that offense is an appetite with better manners. Dryden pressed his palm to the shell and said he could hear a reservoir emptying backward so that the surface remembered what it had never known, and Estelle confessed in a voice large enough to fill her own hands that boats made her nonsensically angry. I tucked the shell behind Henri\u2019s stitched wallet, in the soft of my dress, where the left side could keep watch. It warmed there, and the counting grew fainter, as if the numbers had found a thumb to hold.\n\nThe door to the water was a rope ladder and a circle of glass at once, a porthole that had stopped pretending because it had nothing to gain. The Ma\u00eetresse\u2019s finger drew a figure-eight in the air and broke it gently, making space, and M. Chemin\u2019s map-that-wasn\u2019t slid its loop over our heads like a collar that fit everyone poorly but well enough. When we stepped through, the floor forgot us for a second, and then stones took an interest. The morning outside the Br\u00e8che was not Paris morning; it was a color that cities can only imagine. Grey in the way that remembers blue personally, with salt on it like a rumor someone swore was true. We stood on a wooden pier that had learned to sigh properly, the boards groaning like knees that had carried love around for decades. On one side the school pressed its shoulder against a building that thought it was a boathouse in a town that does not exist, and on the other the sea counted without counting, a long subtraction across a page too big for our sums. The air tasted of iron things that had been asked to be faithful.\n\n\u201cRetrieve a name the tide stole and is tired of carrying,\u201d said the ash-sister, distributing instruction like cards she had already decided would not favor us. \u201cReturn a ring that refuses rust and therefore refuses to tell the truth. Speak to the drowned gate that lets boats pretend their choices are their own. If you are offered a song, pay attention to the verse where the singer runs out of breath. That is the price.\u201d She looked at me last and added, almost idly, \u201cDo not be elegant.\u201d It sounded like an insult and a caress, and I hated how much I appreciated the balance of it.\n\nWe went with Dryden again because water prefers the familiar and had already put the outline of him in its pocket. Estelle carried the feeling of a dockworker badly hidden under a schoolgirl\u2019s bravery, and I brought my usual collection of reluctances. An older student named Maud came with us as a chaperone nobody wanted; she had hair the color of wet rope and eyes that had been narrowed by having to recognize too many kinds of fog. We walked a seam of stones slick with a language I did not speak. Barnacles made their blunt arguments at our ankles, and ropes slept in heavy coils that dreamed of throats and would deny it in daylight. Above us a gull made a noise that would have been obscene if it had been said in a room. We found footprints on the weathered planks that stepped into water and did not step out and then reappeared three boards later as if someone had been returned from the middle of a sentence. I shivered and felt the shell answer, a little more urgently wrong than before.\n\nTo ask the sea to open a door, you must use a word that was not made with hands. The ash-sister says this sort of thing as if she invented it and the sea had taken notes. Dryden put his face to the split between the boards and exhaled, and the water rose to meet his breath with the politeness of a host that intends the party to last until morning. \u201cPrice,\u201d it hissed with the sand in its voice, and the word rubbed my ears raw. Estelle offered pride immediately, because she is built like a door and wanted the test, and Maud bared her throat in that way certain women do when they are not demonstrating courage but reminding fear that they have paid rent. I put my hand in my pocket and felt the square of cloth the Ma\u00eetresse had given me the first night, and I held it as instructed and thought very loudly about being poor in the correct direction.\n\nThe water did not want breath; it had enough. It did not want iron; it could make its own counterfeit. It wanted something that would make the hinge turn easier when we were not looking. It wanted a morning. Not a particular date with a particular egg at a particular caf\u00e9. It wanted the sort of morning that accumulates behind your bones because you have been kind to a stranger and then forgotten the kindness on purpose. I was angry at that. I have so few of those, and they are small and untidy. But anger is salt with bad manners; it dries you without preserving anything. I thought of a day half a city away when I had hovered above Rue du Bac and watched a woman stoop to tie a child\u2019s shoe as if she were learning prayer in a new religion, and I thought of not letting that memory live with me anymore. The sea sniffed the thought and took it straight from my left hand, where my dead made room and were offended on my behalf. The deck quivered under our feet and parted like lips. We went down in a sway that matched the count inside the shell, except for the places where it did not.\n\nThe drowned gate lay three ribbed lengths out, where pilings lifted their skirts to show the barnacles and did not blush. It looked like a door to nothing, hanging on its hinge by obstinacy and rumor, and I loved it immediately because it refused function but would never admit it. A ring of metal glowed around one of the posts, unoxidized and smug, a wedding band that had married itself and the idea of being undecayed. I pricked the wood with Val\u00e9rian\u2019s pin where a hinge would have been if the gate had remembered its profession today. The wood bled, thin and bitter, and the water laughed in that old way that makes people grow superstitions like mold. \u201cElsewhere,\u201d I said, and Estelle nodded and put her hand on the untruthful ring as if it were a throat she was fond of. Dryden hummed until the metal remembered wanting to be coin, and the ring let go without pride. Maud wrapped it in a square of what looked like waxed cloth and smelled like a promise made in shallow water. \u201cThe name,\u201d she reminded, and we pressed our hands against the gate and asked the question doors are always practicing answers for.\n\nIt told us one of its names without being coy. The drowned do not always play at riddles; they tire of it faster than the rest of us, and the sea is very tired. \u201cI am Shut Because You Thought You Could Not,\u201d it said, and the words went into my wrist bones and settled there like grit. We slid the ash-sister\u2019s folded packet under the latch where a latch would be, and the word sank into the material like a bruise behaving itself. The packet smelled, when I lifted it to my nose, of a storm deciding it could wait. Dryden\u2019s face softened with the relief of work accomplished, and Estelle\u2019s hands flexed as if they were reading a future written on rope.\n\nHunger arrived with the politeness it uses when it wants a tip. A child stood on the steps of stone where the pier met the shore, where algae drew a green horizon an inch above our ankles. She had the look of someone who had been told to wait and had been good about it. The sea had made a ring around her as if to keep dogs off. The ash-sister watched from a shadow that women know before they know their own names. I went toward the child because I am not wise and because hinges prefer doors that try to shut while you are walking through them. \u201cYour hands are wrong,\u201d the child said in a mild voice, and I loved her for the accuracy. \u201cI\u2019m owed,\u201d she added, and the water lifted as if it wanted to see who would go to the trouble of arguing.\n\nI have never liked the way the ash-sister says the word owed. It is too clean in her mouth. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d I said to the child, kneeling so my eyes were level with terror\u2019s eyebrows, \u201cbut perhaps the bookkeeper took lunch.\u201d It was a weak joke, but weak jokes have a certain magic when used properly; you can slip a small truth under their hem while nobody is watching. The ash-sister came a step closer, and the square I had thrown at her yesterday pulsed faintly like a heartbeat under her sleeve. \u201cDo not borrow where you cannot be found to repay,\u201d she murmured, and I showed her my empty right hand and my very full left and dared her to call me a liar.\n\nThe sea asked price without moving its mouth. The shell in my dress stiffened and the counting stumbled on seven and grinned about it. I held the Ma\u00eetresse\u2019s nothing-cloth and let it be what it was. I thought of laughter, tethered and too well-trained. I thought of giving that up and felt my edges complain in a pitch only I could hear. I thought of the thing I have that is least useful and most me. Cats have not seen me since the letter arrived. It had begun as insult and become habit. I could give that. You would laugh if you knew how it hurt. I said to the water, which always prefers the particular, that I would not ask a cat to see me again until I had finished a piece of work I did not yet know the size of. The sea made a sound like someone swallowing an oath, and the ring around the child loosened as if embarrassed to have been seen in public doing anything earnest. Estelle lifted her by the armpits in the way of someone who has hauled sacks of flour with love, and Dryden stood between the water and the air at her back in case a noun decided to change its mind. The ash-sister watched us do all this with a face like embroidery that resented the needle. \u201cDeferred,\u201d she said when the child\u2019s mother ran up with a cry that could have stopped clocks if clocks believed in mercy. \u201cThat debt does not vanish. You have purchased later. Later is an expensive thing to love.\u201d\n\nThe shell thrummed as if approving a line in a song that it did not expect to like. I put it to Estelle\u2019s ear and she flinched and then smiled the slow smile of someone trying on a coat that fits better than the one she was told to love. \u201cTwo,\u201d she said, and said it again, and then the number lost its arithmetic and became a shape that matched the span of her hands. Dryden held the shell and went very still in the way of people who do not enjoy gifts. \u201cHold,\u201d he said, and then coughed, as if the taste of the word on his tongue had changed the water in his mouth. The shell warmed once and then cooled as if it remembered itself too late.\n\nWe walked back as if the pier were a sentence we were unwilling to finish. Maud taught us to swear in a dialect of storms that nobody writes down anymore because the paper cannot float after, and she told us that the ring would try to lie about what it had seen, which is the habit of all things that think rust is an insult and not a kind of loyalty. The Br\u00e8che took us in without ceremony. M. Chemin collected our packets with the absent competence of a man who has learned to map the parts of speech that refuse to sit through lessons. He sniffed ours and nodded and said \u201cShut Because You Thought You Could Not\u201d under his breath like a recipe. The ash-sister returned my cloth folded twice into smaller and said nothing about interest, which worried me more than an invoice would have. Her sleeve smelled of smoke and weather.\n\nThat evening I went to the library of doors because the smell of kelp had gotten into the seams of my attention and I needed the dry logic of wood to scrape it off. The shelf where I slept had a new inscription in a language I could read if I practiced kindness to it: Later. It was not an invitation. It was an opinion. I ran my knuckle lightly along the grain and heard a sound under my finger like a throat refusing an apology. The figure-eight on the air hovered in a memory I had not had time to make, and the thorn that mended it pricked through as if the emblem on my letter wanted to be sure I had not mistaken it for anything else. I tried to turn, the way a hinge does when nobody is looking at it and it wants to be good, and the door did not. Later, it repeated, and behind the refusal I smelled a house I had not lived in where the windows are always almost open.\n\nThe shell had fallen asleep in my pocket and then woken without my permission. I took it out and set it on my pillow next to my dictionary of sighs, and the two looked at each other like elderly neighbors who suspect the other of borrowing sugar and never washing the cup before returning it. Numbers spilled out again, all the wrong shapes, curls where there should be angles, angles where there should be curves, and I put my palm over the shell to make the voice say please. It did not. I thought of Val\u00e9rian and the small freckle that sat at 4:08 near his mouth and wondered what time his ankle bones claimed for themselves when he stood at his bench and let the weight of him be part of his work. I felt foolish for missing a man who was mostly clocks. The feeling did not diminish because I told it to.\n\nIn the middle of the night, the building flexed its shoulders the way it does when it intends to slip past a refusal. A moth knocked once against the underside of the shelf and then was not a moth. Paper slid toward me as if the school had coughed and found a lost cough in its pocket. The seal was that thin white again, the starved color that pretends to be nothing and then shows you the bruise you left when you thought you were gentle. The figure-eight unclosed and stitched shut by a thorn hurt my eyes, and I licked the taste of lilac ash off my lip before it had time to make a claim. The letter smelled like rain that had been asked to wait. Inside, the hand I knew from the dream I couldn\u2019t remember had written my name as if it were a direction. It did not say you have been accepted; that had already been done to me. It said Tuition. It said Due. It said 4:08 in the corner with a dot of ink that freckled like a mouth opening and closing on a word it would not use in polite company. It said Bring what you cannot leave.\n\nThe morning pretended it had not heard. Madame Panse served bread that was not both crusted and not crusted but simply bread, and the tea tasted like having nothing to say to a friend you love and deciding to sit anyway. The Ma\u00eetresse d\u2019Entr\u00e9e spoke in the stairwell and did not mention the sea or the letter because the school does not argue with its own weather in public. Estelle held her cup in both hands and made a face when the heat bit her palms and then smiled as if being bitten were the correct thing to have done. Dryden found a coin in his pocket that he had not put there and returned it to the air, which is the only safe way to be honest in a building like this. I folded the letter along its crack where the figure-eight had broken and mended and tucked it against my ribs where the emblem could burn through if it needed to make its point.\n\nAt the end of the day, when classes had finished telling us things we already knew in words we had not yet earned, I went somewhere you will not put on a map. The Br\u00e8che keeps a room where people go to practice not promising. It is lined with mirrors that will not admit to being mirrors unless you are cruel to them, and the ash-sister likes to stand there and apply imaginary lipstick while telling you the price of watching yourself break and then not fixing it. I do not go there because I do not enjoy certain kinds of truth. I went instead to a hall where the floor forgot to be a floor every third board and remembered what it had been before wood. There is a window there that only looks out when you have done something you regret while telling yourself it was necessary. I held the shell against the glass and asked it if it had room for one more wrong number, and it said yes with the eagerness of a child who has not yet learned what yes costs.\n\nIt was later, both the word and the hour, when the city made itself heard through the pipes, the way a mother clears her throat when you misunderstand something she has said since you were small. The counting in the shell stopped at four and then refused to be anything else. I thought of 4:08 receding like a tide that had decided to be punctual for once, and the corners of my bones made that fault-line noise again that I was trying to learn to distinguish from danger. I did not sleep properly. I lay beside the dictionary and the shell and the letter, and I invented many ways to pretend that tuition could be paid with things I had already lost, and I admired my own inventiveness like a thief who marvels at the weight of what is not yet stolen.\n\nIn the morning, the ash-sister stood at the end of my shelf as if she were a portrait that refused to be hung where people could see it. \u201cYou received a bill,\u201d she said, not a question, and her smile was small and efficient like a blade that does not brag. \u201cI told you we do what is owed,\u201d she added, as if she were tired of being right, which I cannot imagine she ever is. I showed her my left hand and she nodded because it was heavy. I showed her my right and she shrugged because it never is, not for long. \u201cYou will be sent to the place in the city where numbers pretend to be mercy,\u201d she said. \u201cDo not mistake the line you stand in for the line you are crossing. Doors love that error, and they will keep it in sugar for you until you are old.\u201d\n\nI went looking for Val\u00e9rian not with my feet but with the part of me that has learned to travel by absence. The city breathed through the bricks in a rhythm that was not mine but that I could borrow if I was polite. When I pressed my face to the cold in the window between two bald lamplight patches, there was no clockshop where it should have been; there was a smear of afternoon where morning should have held itself and a smell of onion soup that felt like a mistake. I pulled back before the ache behind my eyes could make decisions for me. I told myself he was as permanent as the freckle at the corner of his mouth and that permanence is a silly word in my line of work. I folded my names and tucked one I had not used in years into my cheek the way you keep a coin for emergencies.\n\nIn class, M. Chemin drew the figure-eight again and opened its bruise so gently the chalk did not complain. \u201cWhat happens when you overpay,\u201d he asked the air, and the air, which had been to school before, did not volunteer. \u201cYou are changed before you arrive,\u201d he said, and looked at me as if the answer had my face. \u201cYou lose the habit of being one thing. Some of you should have never been one thing. This will suit you, until it doesn\u2019t.\u201d Madame Panse delivered pears that were pears and memories of pears, and even I, who do not eat, admired the elegance of the trick and the kindness of her pretending it was not a trick at all.\n\nI did not open the letter a second time because it would have been greedy. I held it like a vow. At four in the afternoon the Br\u00e8che\u2019s clocks, all of which disagree out of principle, agreed to arrive at eight for the minute it takes to be exact by accident. Something on my left hand moved to make room. Something on my right scratched and begged for work. I went to the place the ash-sister had not told me to go and found the line that people use when they are told that mercy can be exchanged for paper. It was the prefecture where permits are issued to souls who want to cross the city without losing their heart in neighborhoods where hearts are collected for sport. The line had a smell like winter coats hung too close together. A man in a blue scarf stood near the back and waved at a woman who pretended not to see him in order to see him better. I was a hinge. I made myself the right size and fit into a seam between a woman\u2019s hat and a man\u2019s impatience. I put the shell against the metal of a stanchion that had been touched too many times by people learning to wait. The counting inside it smiled and said 4:08 like a prayer and like an accusation. I looked for Val\u00e9rian because I am very poor at learning what the lesson is until I have paid for it and for the coat it came in.\n\nA moth landed on my wrist, and because I am incapable of respecting the economy of patterns, I fed it a crumb of lamplight that I had hoarded in my hair. It sat with the modesty of messengers who know they will be paid twice for being the sort of animal people forgive. It had no letter for me. That is a letter, too. I went back to the Br\u00e8che. The ash-sister did not say anything; she never needs to. The Ma\u00eetresse told us we would go to mirrors tomorrow with our eyes closed and that we would learn to open them only when we could say our names without thinking of our faces. Dryden muttered the word hold into his tea until it settled. Estelle measured her hands against the table\u2019s scars and smiled when her palm matched the constellation exactly. The shell on my pillow clicked once like a clock that had decided to be honest for a single minute, and in the tiny quiet after, before the school inhaled for its next trick, I knew that debts had many shapes and that one of them was a freckle that sometimes was a time.Chapter 6\n\nThe morning we were given the mirrors, the Br\u00e8che behaved as if it had woken from a good dream and was trying not to spoil it by telling us. The stairwell where lessons took their best shape had been hung with frames that did not hold glass so much as they held their breath. We were told to walk with our eyes closed until the word, and the word would come from someone who did not own us. It was not a trick; it was worse and better. It was practice.\n\n\u201cNames first,\u201d the Ma\u00eetresse d\u2019Entr\u00e9e said, and her voice had the grain of a plank that has known the sea and gone on knowing floors after. \u201cFaces after. Faces lie in ways names cannot afford.\u201d Madame Panse stood at the landing with cups of something that smelled like steam warming its hands, and she gave one to anyone whose knees forgot what knees are for. The ash-sister leaned against a pillar that had watched surrender become fashion three times in this building\u2019s history, and she looked at our closed eyes with the affection of a winter window that knows which breath will fog it first.\n\nEstelle went ahead with the bravery of someone who has not yet learned to be suspicious of her own courage. \u201cEstelle,\u201d she said to the breathing frames, and the first mirror stiffened delicately, as if it had been asked to be honest at breakfast. \u201cAgain,\u201d said the Ma\u00eetresse, soft as thread. \u201cEstelle,\u201d Estelle said, and let the syllables widen until her hands could sit in them. The mirror did not give back a face. It gave her the shape of her name the way water shows you your height by remembering how you fall. Dryden followed, his lashes worrying the air, and when he said his name the mirror handed him a thirst and waited to see whether he would swallow it or let it stand on the rim of the cup and call itself weather.\n\nI did not want to go. I am very good at wanting not to go. But hinges do not get the luxury of sulking; we are built for doors that have no patience with hurt. I stood in front of a frame carved with vines that had never intended to fruit, and I closed my eyes so that if I stumbled I could pretend I had meant to. \u201cLorette,\u201d I said, and felt the way my names sit in my mouth, like cats who pretend they were not invited. The frame considered whether to pretend it had never met a hinge before. \u201cAgain,\u201d the Ma\u00eetresse murmured, and I had to decide how not to lie to myself in public. \u201cLorette,\u201d I said, and let the word crack where it needed to. The mirror breathed. It did not give me a face. It gave me a minute. 4:08, the taste of it on my tongue like iron rinsed three times to be polite. Blue light from an ambulance turning a man\u2019s hand into a flag of meat. A metro mouth that had not decided whether to spit or swallow. Lilacs that had been burned and snatched back from smoke at the last possible second by rain that had been raised to mind its manners.\n\n\u201cEyes,\u201d said the Ma\u00eetresse so quickly that the ash-sister did not have time to smile at my disobedience, and I opened them because I have learned which orders to obey as if I had invented them. The mirror did not hold my face. It held the back of my head, the tilt of my shoulders when I pretended to be taller than grief. It showed me the hinge of me, the place where I turned. Behind that the minute sat and refused to let the glass forget. The emblem on my letter, tucked where it could bruise me when I breathed too deeply, pressed its broken loop into my ribs as if to say you will not get out of this with metaphors.\n\n\u201cPayment,\u201d said the mirror in a voice I would have trusted if it had been a woman asking me to hold her bag while she fastened a child\u2019s coat. \u201cBring what you cannot leave.\u201d I had brought my left hand, full as always, and my right, which tried to be brave by being easy. The cloth the Ma\u00eetresse had given me sat soft as attic air between my fingers, and I held it as a decoy that did not insult the hunter. I could not pay laughter; it had already learned to return to other mouths without me. I could not pay the cats; that coin had rolled into the sea and purchased later. All that left me, once I had told the truth that made me wince, was the thing Val\u00e9rian called me when I had needed a name he could afford. Mon \u00e9cho. If I gave that, the mirror would be satisfied and I would have to learn how to want otherwise.\n\n\u201cI will give my echo,\u201d I said, and the ash-sister\u2019s head tilted like a knife that had heard its own nickname. The mirror looked pleased and pitiless; glass prefers exactness. \u201cLeft,\u201d said the Ma\u00eetresse from behind my shoulder, and I moved the weight into the correct palm so that my right could pretend to be generous without being stupid. I paid. The sound unlatched. It did not leave; it rerouted. I felt it go not out of my mouth but out of my bones, and the loss made a small professional hole in me, the way removing a gear will not stop a clock but will change how it refuses to tell the truth.\n\nThe glass warmed in the way of things that are proud of having gotten what they asked for without earning the right to be proud. It softened around the minute like fat around a scar. 4:08 shifted, not away, but deeper into the frame where I could not see it unless I chose to be cruel to myself. \u201cTuition,\u201d the mirror said, satisfied and administrative, and the letter under my dress cooled as if a tongue had licked its seal for luck. I stepped back and had to hold the railing because the part of me that loved Val\u00e9rian had never had to be brave about sound before.\n\nDryden watched me with that opaque offense of boys who suspect someone is better at losing than they are, and Estelle wrapped both her too-big hands around my wrist and squeezed until my attention stopped wandering. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d she asked, and the kindness of the question was that it gave me a choice I had not had all morning. \u201cYes,\u201d I said, because I do not believe in confusing children early unless it will make them more elegant later, and I had been asked not to be elegant.\n\nWe were fitted with new work as if the day were a body we had to grow into before sunset. M. Chemin showed us a map of the city that had been walked into being by shoes alone, no ink, no paper, the figure-eight laid on its side and then upright and then broken and mended and broken again in the margin. He pointed at a place that was all corners and no center. \u201cThere,\u201d he said, and did not say prefecture because he did not want the building to hear its own name and begin rehearsing its smugness. \u201cNumbers pretending to be mercy. You will stand where waiting becomes an art form and you will watch what lines do to the faces that stand in them. If you are offered a ticket, do not eat it, even if it smells like sugar. If you are offered a name, check its weight. If it weighs less than a button, it is counterfeit.\u201d\n\nWe went, because the school opened a door that resembled a window that resembled a hole and because students behave like water when the floor tilts toward an edge. The room of surrender that the city uses to pretend it is kind had queues taped to the ground in the geometry of despair. Numbers fed on themselves and called it order. The air tasted like wool coats that had learned how to wait for years at a time. The man in the blue scarf stood three bodies ahead of a woman with a topknot that was trying to be the bravest thing on her head. He was still making bridges with his face. The clerk at the front had fingers like rubber stamps that had never been taught to bring back what they took.\n\nEstelle clutched her packet with the pinch of someone who mistrusts paper in rooms with fluorescent light. Dryden counted the tiles because he could not count the people without being obliged to be kind to them. I slid myself into a seam between two coats and stood where my size made me useful. At the window, a woman with eyelids polished with the boredom of ten thousand days held out her hand for a life. It is the city\u2019s best trick: ask for a life in pieces so small that the donor forgets to make a ceremony. \u201cMinute,\u201d the clerk said, and I tasted the ink in her throat. \u201cWhich?\u201d the woman asked, which was better than crying. \u201cFour oh eight,\u201d said the clerk, and scratched the air with her pencil where a freckle would sit if mouths had corners, and I made a sound that would have been an echo if I had not spent it.\n\nThe ash-sister appeared at the end of the counter without having had to walk there, which is her idea of telling the truth. \u201cDo not pay with other people\u2019s freckles,\u201d she said, audible to nobody except those of us who already owed her attention. \u201cIf the city wants beauty put into numbers, it can go cut its own face.\u201d I hated that she was right. I loved that she was right. The clerk repeated the question because she was paid to. The woman said she did not have a watch, that she did not wear a watch because time made her wrists itch, and the clerk smiled with her teeth the way a drawer smiles when it sticks. The line shuffled and pretended not to practice its cruelty.\n\nI had the letter folded against my skin, the thin white of its seal busy being subtler than blood. I held my left hand and thought of the minute as if it were something I could hide under my tongue and keep from the world until I found the correct amount of wanting to spend. I thought of Val\u00e9rian\u2019s mouth and its 4:08 freckle, and how he had found a name for me when I was a draft nobody had intended to write that day. \u201cWe will pay with if,\u201d Henri had once said to me when a policeman practiced forgetting that the bookstall was not his to arrange. \u201cYou can pay with if exactly once and you must not do it in a place that sells tickets.\u201d He had stitched a wallet for my names; I wished now he had stitched one for my conditions. If Val\u00e9rian had given that minute to me once without knowing, if he had wound himself tight so that I could sleep in a winter where the snow had the weight of loneliness and the taste of sugar that was only salt with better intentions, then I owed him that minute\u2019s safe return. If the Br\u00e8che wanted tuition, it could take it from my hinge; there was enough turning left in me to bankrupt a small academy.\n\nThe clerk called a number and the speaker made it sound like the kind of poem that keeps its verbs on a leash. The line moved. Estelle squeezed my arm and then let go with an apology because she is learning to be big without being careless. Dryden thought the word hold under his breath until the air decided it had had enough and exhaled him back. \u201cWe cannot win here,\u201d he said to the floor. \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cbut we can steal something we meant to lose.\u201d We left because the kindest thing we could do to the prefecture was to deprive it of our inventory.\n\nParis held its door to us the way a person holds the door for a stranger they have learned to be suspicious of. I flew low without being a bird, and we found Henri under a sky the exact color of a cheap metal teapot after a long winter. He had a scarf that wanted to be blue and a book that insisted on being poetry even with all its teeth knocked out. \u201cYou look like someone who has learned to give up something you loved and cannot think of a way to boast about it,\u201d he said, looking at me and at nobody else, and I put my hand on his counter because I did not want to put it through his chest and hide there like I have wanted to hide inside all my best men. \u201cIf,\u201d I said, because I am only generous with words I cannot afford, and he nodded as if he had expected me to spend my once in that shop under that bridge at that hour in that weather.\n\n\u201cI stitched you a receipt the day you left me with your lefts,\u201d he said, and produced from under a stack of novels with lungs the size of postage stamps a strip of glove-leather with my names whittled into it in shorthand a magician might refuse to be caught using. \u201cYou will hand it to the thing that pretends to tally and will tell it you have paid with contingency. It will laugh. It will try to charge you interest in nostalgia. You will look at it with the gaze of a hinge contemplating a rusty door in spring. It will reconsider. If it does not, bring me back my own name in a cup and I will drink money out of it until the cup admits it has limits.\u201d He smelled of glue and weather and kindness, which is a hard scent to carry in a city hungry for nouns.\n\nWe went to the only clock I knew that enjoyed lying with enough dignity to make the truth blush. The west face at the Orsay took us in as if it had been expecting us, which it had, because time gossips, and this clock in particular has a very untidy tongue for a public instrument. The Ma\u00eetresse had taught us the way the third step changes you if you let it; I took that step as if it were a dance with a partner who has already decided to be the better one. Dryden held the idea of breath between his teeth and did not let it fog the glass; Estelle bent her head the way people do when they intend not to be in the way of what is larger than them and would not forgive them for trying. The gears that know midnight better than the word itself hummed the sound of a throat warming before a song, and I told my bones to be brave by being exact.\n\nThe woman who had taken me through before was not there. The clock does not send you the same chaperone twice if it can help it; it is its own kind of mercy. I set Henri\u2019s stitched receipt against the lip of the brass where the figure-eight of the mechanism rests before a stroke, and I told the city I had paid with if. The air laughed politely, which is the worst kind of laugh. The emblem at my ribs pricked where the thorn had mended the broken loop and reminded me that politeness is an instrument used to move knives between courses. \u201cFurther,\u201d said the minute that had moved into the glass and refused to leave. \u201cFurther,\u201d repeated the clock with the pride of a liar who has decided to know his own limits. \u201cFurther,\u201d said Estelle, whose hands had learned the length of rope this morning and were practicing on my fear.\n\nI went further. The third step became a fourth, and it behaved like those numbers in my shell that had unlearned arithmetic for a principled reason. My echo was gone and my mouth was quiet enough that I could hear my own hinge turn without being embarrassed by how much I wanted it to sound like a song. The glass did not crack. It reworded itself. The minute opened. 4:08 had a room, and the room had a table, and on the table there was a freckle drawn in ink that had not yet dried. Val\u00e9rian\u2019s mouth leaned over the table as if deciding whether the freckle belonged to him. The ash-sister sat at the far end, as if summoned by the quality of the light, which had the admirable stupidity of sun filtered through dust in a workshop where love is measured in millimeters and regret in signatures.\n\n\u201cYou cannot pay for a minute twice,\u201d she said, and her delight at informing me of this was almost tender. \u201cYou can pay for it once and then reimburse it forever. That is what the Br\u00e8che sells, little hinge. The habit of repayment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI paid with if,\u201d I said, and laid Henri\u2019s leather on the table with all the ceremony I own. The ash-sister\u2019s eyes softened the way velvet softens light. \u201cDung,\u201d she said, but she said it like a compliment to the man who had thought to bring muck into the palace to test whether the marble had any respect for what grows. \u201cA receipt is a story about the future told by a liar who intends to be honest later.\u201d\n\n\u201cLater is expensive,\u201d I said, and the minute smiled and spilled a blue light like the wrong kind of nostalgia over my hands. Dryden made a sound and swallowed it before it could find my missing echo and make a mess. Estelle looked at the table as if it were a person pretending to be a door and had failed.\n\nThe clock made the shape of a question with its teeth and decided to be generous. \u201cWho caught 4:08 when it fell out of the sky,\u201d it asked, casual as a market woman inquiring whether you prefer pears that bruise easily or pears that hate pleasure. \u201cHe did,\u201d I said, and put my hand where Val\u00e9rian\u2019s mouth had once been, which is a terrible sentence and truer than I will allow myself to feel on days when the work is simpler than love. \u201cHe caught it and put it in his freckles and gave it to me with tea in a thimble and told the minutes not to tick loudly when I slept. I will not give you that. I will give you my hinge.\u201d The ash-sister clucked her tongue because she hates melodrama in other people and adores it in herself. \u201cYou will not survive without that,\u201d she said, and her voice made the kind of circle that draws chalk around your foot to see whether you will step out. \u201cI will survive sideways,\u201d I said, and took the pin Val\u00e9rian had given me and pricked my right palm so that my left would not have to do all the work.\n\nBlood is currency that has been pretending to have retired for centuries; the city knows how to spend it better than I do. I pressed my palm to the brass tooth that holds the minute down when it would rather be anything else, and I let the gear chew the idea of me. It did not hurt in a way I can tell you about without lying. It hurt in a way that is most like being told a truth at the wrong time with the right amount of love. The clock swallowed. 4:08 shivered and then sat properly, a good dog briefly. The ash-sister took Henri\u2019s receipt and folded it in her sleeve and did not return it. \u201cInterest,\u201d she said, and smiled like a banker with a sense of humor that had cost her friends.\n\nWe came away at the wrong pace. Estelle had tears on her face and refused to be embarrassed. Dryden\u2019s eyelashes had learned a new way to move that would make doors forgive him. My mouth felt strange, as if it had been waiting to be returned to me unharmed since last winter. I reached for an echo I had given and found the space where it used to live. It looked like a chair kept empty for someone who is late as a habit and loved enough to be allowed to be. I put my hand on the glass and said nothing where the word would have gone.\n\nI went to Val\u00e9rian because I am not subtle about my needs when they involve people who have never asked me to be smaller. The shop was open and irritated at a spring that had learned to be coy. He looked up, and the freckle at 4:08 near his mouth grinned at me like a child who had escaped bedtime and expected applause. \u201cMon\u2014\u201d he began, and stopped as if someone had replaced one of the gears in his head with an honest question. \u201cMy wind,\u201d he said instead, and the word did not fit his mouth yet, but it did not cut him to say it. He poured tea without counting. He did not tell his clocks to tick softly; they did it themselves because they had learned something from the way the minute had behaved under my hand. \u201cYou look like someone who has not slept in the conventional sense and is proud of the compromise,\u201d he said, and I laughed and did not hear myself from anywhere except the place behind my eyes where laughter lives when you have spent it. I wanted to tell him I had almost paid with his face, and I wanted to tell him I had chosen my hinge instead, and both were the kind of intimacy that should be explained only to wood and paper, never to men with hands.\n\nHe touched the back of my knuckle with his forefinger the way a man will touch a mouse through a glass for luck because he does not know the correct prayer. \u201cDo your teachers know what to call you now?\u201d he asked, and there was the smallest sadness on his lower lip like dust on a church where nobody is praying for rain. \u201cThey know how not to,\u201d I said, and he laughed not with his mouth but with his cheekbones, which is a trick I am trying to learn. We sat without needing to pretend we had business, which is also a kind of magic that should cost more than it does.\n\nThe Br\u00e8che did its trick with the sea again that night, and I kept my eyes closed and held the shell against my pulse so that the numbers would have something to count other than their own wrongness. The building traveled like a ship that had learned walking narrowly and intended to show off, and when it settled, my shelf had shifted exactly one finger\u2019s width away from the door titled The Dress Was Gold, and there was a new door beside me called The Minute You Would Not Pay. I did not open it. I am many things, but I am not a fool every day.\n\nThe ash-sister visited the library of doors late, when the chairs believe themselves to be better at being trees than at being furniture. She sat on the edge of my shelf with the lack of weight of someone who has spent her appetite somewhere honest and intends to rest until something more expensive requires her. \u201cYou paid with blood like a child,\u201d she said, not unkind. \u201cNext time, pay with direction. That is a coin most people refuse to recognize, and you can spend it without leaving a stain.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf,\u201d I said, and she sighed like a door deciding to be a window for a season. \u201cYou will run out of that,\u201d she warned, and the warning was a gift wrapped in disapproval so I would be sure to open it. \u201cInterest,\u201d I said, and she tapped her sleeve where Henri\u2019s receipt slept and smiled a small smile that would have made a better woman than me forgive her. \u201cI keep accounts,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a vice of mine. And a hobby. And a profession. You will come to me when the school asks you to begin paying in earnest, and you will want to be elegant about it, and I will tell you again not to be. Elegance is a tax you have no need to pay.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you ever owe?\u201d I asked, and she did not pretend not to hear. \u201cConstantly,\u201d she said. \u201cI owe the sea a different weather than the one I give it. I owe doors the promise that I will not lock them and I lie about it every day. I owe girls their small brutalities and I turn them into poetry because I am vain. That is why I am so patient with debt. It loves me. I am not offended by that.\u201d\n\nWhen she left, the shell on my pillow counted three and laughed, and then counted eight wrong enough to feel like a kindness. The letter under my dress sat quiet as a wolf who has eaten and intends still to look hungry for sport. I lay on my shelf with my left hand heavy and my right hungry and told the ceiling my best truth, which is that I prefer people who make a room quieter by entering it, and that I am learning to forgive myself for being the kind who makes rooms listen harder. In the morning, the school would teach us how to cross a street without losing the part of yourself that stands at the curb and waits for the person you would have been under a different weather. In the night, I taught myself how to count without needing to hear myself do it, and I missed my echo badly enough to call it a lesson.\n\nWe did the mirrors again because the Br\u00e8che believes in repetition with malice. The frames breathed at us as if they were embarrassed by how much they loved our failures. Estelle said her name with her eyes open this time and did not flinch when the glass tried to be helpful. Dryden looked at himself and saw water pretending to be kind, which is the water\u2019s oldest lie and also its most charming. I stood where I had stood and watched the place where the minute had left a hole in the world and filled it with something else. The glass gave me a street and a woman with a braid and a step that had been brave for three hundred years and was asking, reasonably, for a day off. \u201cWe mend,\u201d said the Ma\u00eetresse, and M. Chemin drew his map in the air where a child could reach it without being punished.\n\nI remembered to hold the cloth when they asked again for what I could not leave. I gave nothing that morning, which felt like theft and tasted like prudence. Madame Panse served pears that were just pears and we ate them like saints who had recently discovered hunger. The Br\u00e8che went to work counting its doors and feeding its patience. Paris breathed outside, and the river did not apologize for wanting, and the ash-sister sharpened her smile on the banister and looked at me the way a locksmith looks at a door she intends to love into opening.\n\nWhen I went to see Val\u00e9rian later, the freckle at 4:08 had moved half a breath. Or I had. He called me his wind and the word warmed the room without embarrassing the tea. I brought him a sigh from the dictionary that had been collected in a theater where two actors had decided to forgive each other the same night as the audience did not, and he placed it under a cracked glass dome and listened to it as if it were a small bird insisting on being a storm. He told me a story about a spring that had refused to coil and had taught him a better way to be stubborn. We said nothing about tuition because sometimes you must be unscholarly on purpose to have anything left of yourself when the bell rings.\n\nThe shell counted again that night, and it forgot seven, and I loved it for that lapse as you love a man who never remembers to pay the exact amount for coffee and thereby leaves you with a debt that is a pleasure to owe. I slept like hinges do, half open, ready to admit whatever thought demanded entrance without checking its shoes for mud. I dreamed of a door whose spine read The Minute You Would Not Pay and of my hand on its page, and in the dream I did not open it. The restraint felt like skill. When I woke, the Br\u00e8che smelled of rain that had remembered its manners, and Paris had folded itself so that the street where I had given the step a name lay closer than it had been yesterday. We were to go there in the afternoon and ask the threshold if it had kept the name we had paid for, and I could not decide whether I was more afraid it had or that it had not.Chapter 8\n\nThe afternoon had the color of paper that has been handled often by careful hands, and the air along Rue Jacob kept its chin up as if determined to ignore the anecdote of rain building politely in the west. We went to the step as if we had been told to leave our shoes at the door of a house that did not own us, Estelle with her palms open to make a table for whatever answer might fall, Dryden with his lashes counting the streetlights for luck, and me with Henri\u2019s stitched wallet pressed against my heart and the square of cloth the Ma\u00eetresse had given me tucked into its own quiet. The tread remembered us in the particular way old thresholds remember kindness when it endangered them, which is to say with suspicion and gratitude in alternating bands. I crouched until the smell of lichen and footsteps was the only weather my face knew for a breath, and spoke as you speak to a dog that has found its voice and does not trust it yet.\n\n\u201cDo you keep the name we paid for,\u201d I asked, and I did not pretend it was a question that could be wrapped in a ribbon and returned later. The wood made a sound like pride clearing its throat, the grain showing its age where a thousand heels had made blessings into chores. \u201cI keep it until someone insists I am Not Worth It again,\u201d it said, because thresholds learn resignation the way stone learns patience, slowly and then all at once. \u201cToday they painted me,\u201d it added, and I could smell it then, the hot clean that pretends to erase history and only tightens it. \u201cPaint is a good liar,\u201d Dryden murmured, swaying on his feet to make the number of boards beneath him match something liked by his tongue, and Estelle laid a hand flat so the step could lean if it chose.\n\nThe folded scrap the ash-sister had called homework softened when I touched it to the riser, the fabric remembering water where none had been offered. The name \u201cCome Home\u201d rose from it like steam from morning bread, and the step shivered, indecent for a moment with relief. \u201cPrice,\u201d it said, polite even in need, and this time I did not offer time or blood or any of the large coins people reach for when they want to feel generous. I paid with direction. I gave it the way I would never again cross Rue Jacob from the left after dusk, the exact path my body made between the caf\u00e9\u2019s awning and the shop with the dyed scarves, the sequence of feet that had preened themselves into habit. I set that track down and did not fetch it back, and the step took it like a cat takes the warm cushion when you stand to answer the door and do not return quickly enough. My left hand protested, but it is used to being overruled when I am trying to be clever.\n\nWe walked on with the aftertaste of being improved by a small surrender. Estelle carried the knowledge in her wrists the way bakers carry recipes, without needing paper, and Dryden hummed a line of song he had been refusing to like and had finally forgiven. The city approved in its favorite way, by pretending not to notice and then opening three doors in a row that had no business being open in that weather. I felt the shape of the day tug itself into an eight and then worry its middle where the thorn lives, exactly the way the emblem on my letter does to my ribs when it wants to remind me of geometry.\n\nThey gave us class in a vestibule where plaster had cracked into maps and nobody had decided whether to mend or admire. M. Chemin drew the figure-eight in dust on the floor with his boot and opened its wound with two fingers, tender as a gentleman taking a splinter from a child. \u201cYou saw one part hold,\u201d he said, and nodding toward Estelle was as much praise as he allowed; it pleased her hands. \u201cToday you will see what happens when the loop refuses to mend. The city is stupidly elegant at this. It has made a habit of leaving things open and calling it modern. You will find the place where numbers pretend to be mercy and you will watch the seam widen, and if you can close it without needing to be thanked, you will pass.\u201d\n\nHe did not say prefecture because the word makes buildings preen, but the Br\u00e8che made us a door with the sigh of a bureaucrat who had once fallen in love with someone from the theater and had never forgiven himself for being changed by it. The room of surrender had added chairs as if it had been fed overnight, rows of plastic that squeaked when shame sat down. The line was longer and had learned a new way to breathe. The clerk who had asked for 4:08 earlier had a scarf today, thin and black like a cautious argument, and her pencil had chewed marks that matched the teeth of the man who waited fourth. The number box announced itself with the smug ping of a faucet that thinks it has become a fountain.\n\nWe did not stand in the line. We watched it move, the way a doctor watches a throat swallow to see which muscle is lazy, and we learned a great deal about how people make cages and then tell themselves the bars are tasteful. Estelle grew large in her patience and made room with her body without anyone knowing they had been made room for. Dryden counted without counting, his shoulders keeping time under his coat like the gears of a clock that has become modest. I tasted paper and metal and a perfume that had been meant for mornings and had been forced to eat lunch. At the window, the clerk took a name as delicately as if removing a ring from a swollen finger. \u201cMinute,\u201d she asked again in the voice of rain that has learned to be dry indoors. \u201cWhich?\u201d the petitioner said, and while the line muttered its knowledge of time zones under its breath, I felt the shell in my dress pull like a fish.\n\nIt had not counted loud since the sea. Now it counted wrong with a purpose, the numbers tripping and laughing and then falling silent on eight until the silence became a number of its own. Inside the shell something had learned a better mischief. I put it to my ear, and the room of surrender noticed without admitting it. \u201cYou cannot feed a line with numerals and expect it to learn to sing,\u201d the ash-sister said from behind a fake ficus, which is an indignity even a teacher should not enjoy. Her coat had gone matte with the dust of patience, and her mouth wore the kind of smile a door uses when it has decided it will open, but only if you ask incorrectly. \u201cWe will take something else today,\u201d she added, and the clerk\u2019s pencil broke at the exact moment her eyes flicked toward me, which means nothing and meant everything, depending who is telling the story.\n\nThe seam widened where waiting becomes wanting, and wanting becomes rule. You could hear it if you listened with your knee bones, a stretch, a soft tear, like a pocket admitting it cannot hold what has been put in it. The crowd adjusted around the failure with the elegance of river water. The city learns this from its river and applies it to its people, which is both kindness and theft. M. Chemin had told us to close without being thanked, and my hands itched with the wish to be invisible and correct. I did the thing I am built for. I set myself between two moments and made a hinge.\n\nI do not know whether most hinges, if asked at a party, would admit that turning is an appetite. Mine is. It wants the door to behave so badly it is almost erotic. The line had become two lines that hated each other and refused to admit it. I put my back to one and my face to the other and moved my weight as if they had been taught to be polite by furniture. Estelle watched how I braced and put a palm where wrists would have been if these moments had been people. Dryden breathed hold into the space between numbers until the numbers forgot themselves and remembered standing. The seam narrowed as relief will when you refuse to point to it. The ash-sister peeled the fake leaves from the ficus one by one and arranged them in her pocket like a woman collecting debts from a plant. The clerk found a new pencil and did not look up. When the line learned to be single again, we left to keep it from thinking it owed us its improved posture.\n\nOutside, the river was practicing being a mirror. I don\u2019t trust it when it does that; it makes people think they are owed themselves. \u201cYou paid with direction,\u201d the ash-sister said as if gossiping with the wind. Her tone made it sound as if I had purchased a dress I could not afford and she intended to both compliment and mock me for how well it fit. \u201cIt will come due at an hour you hate.\u201d I hardened my mouth because she wasn\u2019t wrong and because I am vain; hinges always want to choose their own weather. \u201cYou want me to begin paying with pride,\u201d I said, and she laughed, which is not a thing she does often without sending you a bill for it later. \u201cI want you to realize pride pays in installments.\u201d\n\nVal\u00e9rian\u2019s shop sat where the afternoon could find it, though my route had been sold to a step and I had to arrive by an uglier street that made my wings fold wrong under their own authority. He was leaning like a man who has learned to be tired without accusing his bones of betrayal, and the freckle at 4:08 kept its appointment with his mouth without looking at me to see if I approved. \u201cYou should be meaner to me,\u201d he said when I hovered where the smell of oil and onion makes a treaty neither one keeps. \u201cYou make me want to be kinder than time allows.\u201d It was not flattery; it was a warning disguised as courtesy, which is the exact degree of honesty I can stand.\n\n\u201cI am practicing closing,\u201d I said, because language has to be trained like a dog, and if you never make it do tricks it will embarrass you in company. He set a spring in the palm of his hand that looked like a secret trying to remember how to be a circle. \u201cI am practicing staying,\u201d he offered, and the spring sighed. The shell in my dress muttered eight the way a child mutters gracious after being told to, and he looked up as if I had made a noise I no longer own. \u201cYou had an echo,\u201d he said carefully, and I admired him for not making it into a question. \u201cI have its absence,\u201d I said, which made him smile with his eyebrows because he prefers subtraction when he is working. He poured tea into the thimble, and the steam wrote a message in the air that pretended to be about weather and was not. \u201cBring me a number from the river,\u201d he said unexpectedly, and I thought he was joking until the freckle near his mouth was not. \u201cThey collect them there at dusk until the debris finds another place to pretend to be important. I want a seven, but I\u2019ll take what you can carry.\u201d\n\nWe went back toward the water with the loose stride of thieves looking for small crimes that special-plead themselves as homework. At the Pont Neuf a woman with a tired mouth leaned over stone that had loved hundreds of elbows and did not show favorites. She was not the woman from that rain, but she carried the braid of a life that had practiced reason and was taking a foolish afternoon off. Dryden peeked over and pronounced the river smug, which it was, but perhaps had earned. \u201cNumbers,\u201d Estelle said, and crouched to the seam where water and wall decide they cannot be on a first-name basis. They keep them there, the river and the city, numbers too used to standing in lines to float properly. I reached into the seam with the part of my hand that has learned to be rude without forgetting it is well mannered, and found an eight sullen as a child being forced to apologize, a four cheerful and bleeding slightly where a pigeon had stepped on it, and a seven that had decided to be handsome about its angles because it had been loved by gamblers. I pocketed the seven for Val\u00e9rian, because love is corrupt, and the eight rolled to my left on its own.\n\nThe shape of the day kept wanting to draw itself into a loop, and the thorn pricked in my ribs until I rubbed it to silence. \u201cWe should not keep the eight,\u201d Estelle said, and I could feel the rightness of her discomfort in my ankles. \u201cIt wants to be two circles or none.\u201d Dryden flicked it into the air, and it became the shadow a bird would make if it had been painted on the underside of a bridge where nobody looks. I held the four and loved it for how it remembered tires on wet stone and men who made jokes about thunder to keep from weeping. In the pocket of my dress, the shell warmed and then cooled, as if eavesdropping were a kind of hospitality. I had the unkind thought then that the ash-sister would be pleased if I lost my way while trying to return a number, and immediately afterward I had the exact thought that she had predicted I would have. It is very tiring to be educated by someone who is also an inevitability.\n\nThe Br\u00e8che had put on a lesson about windows by the time we returned, and the Ma\u00eetresse stood with her back to an open one as if daring the night to come in and measure her. \u201cYou will look out only when you can tell me the name of the thing you are not seeing,\u201d she said, and the building enjoyed this kind of precision the way a cat enjoys the corner of a paper bag. Madame Panse fed us soup that was loudly in favor of onions and quietly in favor of survival, and I could not eat, but I warmed my hands on the bowl and felt a little more human for the hypocrisy. M. Chemin took our collected names from the city and filed them with a ceremony that would have been laughable if he had not been sincere as bread. He kept the seven for later as if he had guessed which friend was owed.\n\nWhen the bell that was not a bell stitched and unstuck the evening, the Ma\u00eetresse gave us dark work with a gentle mouth. \u201cThere is a building on Rue S\u00e9guier that believes it is owed panic,\u201d she said, and her tone made it sound like a rumor you could ruin by treating it like a fact. \u201cIt has begun to practice alarms at hours when nothing burns, and the doors laugh. Laughter is a good payment for fear until it becomes the only coin. We will go and name what needs naming and stop making fun of what is trying to be dangerous.\u201d She nodded to me with a kind of politeness that had edges, and I guessed she knew about my echo and did not intend to give me a chair to sit on for the grief.\n\nWe went with a handful of students who had already been taught how to close their eyes without flattering themselves about bravery. The building on Rue S\u00e9guier had a face that had not resisted being pretty and a mouth that had learned to call fire for the company. Smoke curled out of windows like the language of a country that has never been asked for its verbs. The alarm was the shape of a scream that forgot it was in public and continued being honest. People stood on the pavement practicing indignation, which is a talent you must cultivate if you are to live in any city long enough to deserve its rain. The doors were very pleased with themselves. They had been heroes in drills for months and had decided heroism was a kind of flattery they would prefer to serve themselves.\n\n\u201cDo not be elegant,\u201d the ash-sister said in my ear, and I wanted to slam the door on her, which is also a form of obedience. Estelle went to the left door because she is left-handed in all the ways that count, and Dryden breathed hold toward the right until it sighed and admitted it had forgotten what hands felt like. I put my palm where a door would have lungs if it had been made with any, and asked the only question doors cannot throw back at you without paying for it. \u201cWhat are you protecting,\u201d I said, and waited until the hinge lied and then changed its mind and told me a small truth. Behind the giggle of alarms was the woman whose bed was too near the stairwell and who had learned to sleep with weather clenched in her hands. Behind her was a boy who stole the siren sound to put in a toy because he was afraid of being told to grow into noise he did not like. Behind him the ash-sister leaning herself against a bannister and smiling at a habit she had trained personally.\n\nWe spoke to the building in the tone you use on a child who has been rude in public, not because rudeness is a sin but because forgiveness is not a spectacle. \u201cWe will not tell you you are safe,\u201d I said, hating myself for the honesty but loving the shape it made in the air. \u201cWe will let you keep your fear like a dog who has learned not to bite your own feet. When you call fire in an empty room you make room for the day no one will come. Do not be clever. Clever is how buildings die without anybody to hold their corners.\u201d The door tried to laugh and discovered it did not care for the taste. Estelle put her hands on the wood and taught it how to be clasped without foolishness. Dryden named the alarms individually until they were embarrassed to admit they had enjoyed being a chorus.\n\nWhen the street had learned how to hear itself again, a siren cut the air with old authority and earned itself the space it takes. An ambulance painted the walls blue around the place where they had been pretending to be dangerous. It was not the minute; it was a cousin. My ribs remembered that I have a thorn sewn into my eight and rubbed it until it behaved. The ash-sister looked at me from the mouth of an alley and nodded as if to say you see how easy it is to confuse appetite with ritual. I wanted to go to Val\u00e9rian and keep his wrists company the way you would sit on the edge of a roof and pretend to be a weather-vane until the bird returned. Instead I went to the library of doors and pressed my ear to the spine of The Minute You Would Not Pay and did not open it and took the compliment the door offered me for the refusal.\n\nNight found us with our hands smelling of wood and names. The shell slept and woke and counted wrong as if training itself to be a clock nobody in a hospital would trust. Madame Panse gave us sweetness disguised as medicine, a thick jam with citrus and bitterness that made the mouth decide to be brave, and I put my finger into it and tasted the idea of summer in a language that had never met my tongue. The Ma\u00eetresse passed along the long table with her fingers just touching shoulders as if measuring whether we could bear a different weight tomorrow. \u201cDirection,\u201d she said without looking at me, and I let my mouth be quiet because I had already spent its echo.\n\nI did not sleep. I arranged sleep on the shelf and lay nearby with my left hand heavy and my right impatient, and I watched the Br\u00e8che fold itself like a letter that knows it will be opened by someone careless. There is a sound the building makes when it decides to move without telling the city first, the neighborly creak of an old woman standing up in an apartment where the plates remember hands. I held the square of cloth the Ma\u00eetresse had given me and thought of the door on Rue S\u00e9guier and of the woman whose bed had learned smoke as a lullaby and of the boy who would grow into a man who wanted to be loud for money and would be tired afterward. The shell murmured eight in its sleep and then forgot and called itself a bird.\n\nAt dawn I learned how expensive later is. Henri had sewn the word into my shelf as a joke and a warning, and the warning sent a messenger with bad manners. A moth that was not a moth sat on my collarbone and counted four with me and then refused to say eight because it wanted me to supply the number out of pride. I did not. It dropped a packet from its ridiculous black body, and the seal was that white again, starved and polite. The emblem hurt my eyes and pressed its thorn into the habit I have of ignoring instructions until they go away. Inside, the hand I know wrote me a sentence as if it had been dictated by a teacher who was paid by the comma. Direction Due, it said, as if that were a kind of address, and the dot where 4:08 would be if mouths had corners sat at the line\u2019s end with the indifference of time that has stopped needing to be admired.\n\nIf you owe direction, you can pay it two ways. You can get lost, which is the kind of generosity the city pretends to admire until it sees you in the wrong neighborhood and then calls it a crime. Or you can bind yourself to one path and never turn from it, which is a vow so holy I do not think God would dare it. The ash-sister had said to pay with direction the way one uses exact change so as not to leave a debt to the cashier. I went to the window that only looks out when regret stands beside you and names you in a voice you cannot refuse. The city was at the hour when butchers hose their floors and bakers count crowns of loaves with the reverence of priests counting their dead after a feast. I chose a line. I chose a straight path from the Br\u00e8che to Val\u00e9rian to Henri to the step on Rue Jacob to the river to the gate that drowns because it prefers to be honest under water. I promised to walk it every day at dawn until the shell forgot eight. I promised not to deviate for pleasure or mercy or a boy with eyelashes who had found a new verb for thirst. I promised the door that is a mirror and the mirror that is a door and a woman with a braid I did not know and a man with a freckle I did and the ash-sister who keeps accounts of the weather. I promised them all. I made a road, and I called it debt, and I paid with it.\n\nThe Br\u00e8che watched me tie myself to a string and did not applaud. The Ma\u00eetresse d\u2019Entr\u00e9e nodded once when she saw me go past the stairwell with my body set like a metronome, and Madame Panse put a crust in my hand and did not say I cannot eat, because she knows the difference between food and the imitation of company. Estelle reached for my sleeve the way children do when they are trying to teach themselves how to be gentle, and I pulled away and hated myself for it and did not stop walking. Dryden said hold at my back and breathed it into my shoulder, and I felt its edges like a brace I pretended not to be grateful for.\n\nVal\u00e9rian had not yet opened the shop because his clocks had been arguing with the night about whether to be generous with it, and generating peace between hours is as difficult as making love between strangers look like manners. He stood behind the glass with his fingers in the air as if tuning a harp you could only hear if you had already paid for it. I did not go in. The line forbade it. He saw me and put his mouth into the shape that keeps the word mon from harming the word \u00e9cho, and I kept moving and he understood. Henri had set out books with covers the color of exhausted apricots, and he said something under his breath that smelled like late summer, and I kept moving and he swore in the polite dialect of men who will forgive you in two months and not today. The step on Rue Jacob let me pass with a sternness I almost enjoyed. The river counted without counting and lifted its chin to let me see my face and I refused and it laughed the way it laughs at good men who do not sleep well. The drowned gate under the pier blinked its slime-covered eye at me and muttered a name of mine I had not shared, and I said later and went on.\n\nOn the second morning of the vow I missed a corner and the city called it mercy. An old woman with a basket of oranges had dropped one so bright it made the cobbles behave like mirrors, and I bent without thinking because it is a reflex in me, perhaps the only kind thing I have that does not need to be instructed. It rolled under my hand with the feel of a number. Estelle had said that boats made her angry, but I am angered by round fruit that pretends not to be a wheel. I picked it up and put it back in the basket and the woman said the right: merci, and then the wrong: vous \u00eates aimable, and then the right again: still merci because she knew the first truth had been too large for courtesy. I had broken my line, and it felt like being forgiven and then billed for it. When I reached the Br\u00e8che, the shell counted eight as if it had been offered a prize and chose humility, and the letter\u2019s white seal cooled as if I had paid enough for one lesson.\n\nThe ash-sister met me in the library of doors where it is easiest to make promises that become furniture. \u201cYou paid with mercy,\u201d she said, looking annoyed at the correctness of my misstep. \u201cThat coin is counterfeit and real on alternate Wednesdays. No docent will explain the schedule. Keep the difference in your shoe.\u201d I wanted to be cruel to her and be kind to what she loves and failed at both. \u201cYou owe me a receipt,\u201d I said instead, because Henri had taught me how to ask for paperwork when the only things being exchanged are breath and weather. She gave me a smile that would have set a small fire if the room had been less damp and took Henri\u2019s leather from her sleeve and handed it over without a joke. It smelled like rain that has learned to read. \u201cInterest,\u201d she said, as if informing me that the sky had decided to continue.\n\nThey made us study pattern those days because the city had decided to be obvious, and only fools ignore a generous teacher. We walked maplines with our fingers until the skin grew black with chalk, and M. Chemin taught us to find where the thorn pricks the eight and to choose which side of the loop to live in that afternoon. Madame Panse fed us lentils with roasted garlic and declared that debt is better suited to beans than to pearls, and then fed us pears to contradict herself because contradiction is what saves kitchens from boredom. The Ma\u00eetresse d\u2019Entr\u00e9e taught me to stand still while doors decided not to admire me and to accept that a hinge can be loyal without being loud. Dryden learned to drink a glass of water and make it keep a secret. Estelle learned to put her hand on a thing and ask it to be honest without frightening it into beauty. We were a class of small and necessary humiliations, and the Br\u00e8che liked us for it.\n\nAt the end of the third day of my vow, the city decided to be a theater. There was applause that had been waiting years to be heard and finally found a reason, and from under the applause a fire said my name wrong and then again slightly less wrong. Rue Dauphine made the face it makes when smoke goes round the corner with intention, and people turned their heads in the unison that makes you love and hate crowds. Val\u00e9rian\u2019s shop was not on fire. A building four doors down was being taught the difference between arson and loneliness, which is thinner than it should be. I was on my line, and the line does not include detours, and the detour was a man with a freckle that sometimes believes it is a time. I stepped off it and felt the letter in my dress burn my skin with the kind of courtesy that makes you bleed inside and still thank the person for holding the door.\n\nHe was outside, and his face held itself like a bowl trying to keep from spilling. \u201cYou have a promise in your posture,\u201d he said, which is, I admit, the thing I love most in a man, and I threw the promise at his feet and went to the place where people were making a ring that keeps fire from being personal. The door laughed because it had learned to earlier and had not yet learned to stop. \u201cYou must drink later,\u201d I told it, my mouth missing its echo so badly that the desperation had to do the work of urgency. Estelle arrived out of the crowd with a palm that remembered ropes and a jaw that had decided to be unbreakable for the hour. Dryden pulled water from his sleeves in the oldest trick and made it forget it was a trick and remember being a weather. We worked until the river decided it was interested and we could step back without being polite about it. The ash-sister leaned on a lamppost and counted in a different language and made a face at me that could have been called grudging respect if there had been cameras and if she had felt like pretending to be sentimental.\n\nAfterward, in the way of cities, a man told a joke that made crying easier. Madame Panse arrived with a pot that had never intended to leave the kitchen and ladled kindness into paper cups that were not ready for it. Val\u00e9rian stood with his hands in his pockets like a person who refuses to be photographed with his grief. \u201cYou broke your line,\u201d he said, and bent as if to pick up a screw, which is his euphemism for consolation. \u201cI broke it yesterday for an orange,\u201d I said, and he laughed and forgave me the stupid poetry of the confession. The shell in my dress counted eight correctly and then giggled about it, which I did not know shells could do.\n\nAt the Br\u00e8che that night, the door titled The Minute You Would Not Pay sat quietly and radiated the humiliation of a thing that has been resisted correctly. I lay on my shelf with my hands where their lessons could find them in the dark and waited for the building to move. The sea had the patience of a school that knows it will get your children next year if it is dull this term. The city ran its tongue over its teeth and checked for blood and found none and wanted more. The ash-sister came in late and went out later, and she stepped exactly where the boards were weak, not to fall through, but to remind them without cruelty what their job was. I slept under the shell\u2019s counting and woke with the precise headache you get when you have decided to be exact about your promises and the morning has decided to be sloppy. The letter with the white seal lay quiet, which is when I do not trust it.\n\nWe were given mirrors again, and I said my name without expecting to hear any old music. The glass offered me a street and a step and a ring and a freckle and a man and a boy and a woman and a door and a hinge, and I chose the hinge because I know who feeds me. In the afternoon the Ma\u00eetresse sent us to a corner of the city that does not belong to postcards and asked us to find the thing that wanted to become a school and tell it gently that it did not have the patience. When I bent to listen to the crack in the stone that had begun to lecture a cigarette about responsibility, it said a word that smelled like rust and honey. It said audit. I carried the sound back to the Br\u00e8che in my left hand and it made the bones there ring.\n\n\u201cWe do not keep ledgers because other institutions do,\u201d the Ma\u00eetresse said, wiping chalk from her fingers as if it were sugar. \u201cWe keep them because doors like to be paid on time and otherwise they become cruel. You will see auditors. They wear clothes that do not admit to being clothes, and their smiles are made of wax given ambition. You will show them our books with your faces. You will not be elegant. If you can help it, you will be hungry in ways they do not know how to feed.\u201d The ash-sister smiled because she loves a performance where the performers think they are the audience. \u201cI keep accounts,\u201d she said, and I felt the receipt in my pocket warm, which is a sentence I did not expect to think in this life.\n\nHenri sent a boy with a note that pretended to be a bill and turned out to be a poem, and the poem said: Bring back my word if before I forget where it was placed. I smiled and hated him for knowing how to ask me to be careful with something I could only spend once. Val\u00e9rian adjusted a spring with a sigh he had stolen from the dictionary, and his freckle at 4:08 looked like a minute sitting down after being forced to stand through a ceremony it did not enjoy. Estelle learned a new way to be brave quietly, and Dryden learned to be thirsty without performing thirst. The Br\u00e8che shifted in its sleep and opened one eye to watch its auditors rehearse.\n\nOn the morning the men and women who like to be math in coats arrived, I put on the habit of being a hinge and left my echo where it could not be asked to be brave and tied my direction into a knot that would hold until lunch. They came with smiles like upholstery and notebooks that smelled of skin that had not forgiven its former owner yet. They asked for our accounts in numbers, and M. Chemin showed them a map written in chalk dust and sighs. They asked for our outcomes, and the Ma\u00eetresse brought them a door that had learned where to put its fear and a step that had kept its name and a building that had stopped practicing alarms out of loneliness. Madame Panse fed them stew that tasted like fairness, which is an unflattering flavor, and the ash-sister counted their questions the way a lioness counts the legs of hunters and waits.\n\nWhen they asked for my work, I did not open The Minute You Would Not Pay. I put my hand on it and paid with direction and held so still that my hunger made a sound like a moth chewing silk. I told them how to teach a door to accept a hand, which is nothing and everything in a city hungry for nouns. I told them about blood and pride and the cost of paying with later and with if. They wrote nothing down; their pens are trained only to notice certain verbs. Perhaps it was enough that they stood there and let the Br\u00e8che be a school in front of them without flinching. Perhaps it was comedy. The auditors left with their smiles intact, and we had another day to be the sort of people who know what to do with mornings that reek of possibility.\n\nOn the way to my promised line the day after, Paris made the sound it makes when a flock of birds decides simultaneously to forgive a tree for being winter. I was late by intent, which is to say I decided not to be on time and called it a strategy. The shell counted eight and eight and then fell in love with nine, and I tucked it against my skin and let it be wrong in a direction that pleased me. Val\u00e9rian stood at his bench with his left foot lifted the way bird bones lift when they are happy and pretend not to be, and I put the seven on his counter and told him I had stolen it from the river and he told me it had been stolen from him first and we called that fair. He poured tea that tasted like continuing and not reaching the part where we would have to pretend to part.\n\nI am telling you this because the next thing was a door that bled when I put my hand on it and an ambulance that shoved blue into a minute and a freckle that moved and the ash-sister who said we do what is owed and laughed because she already knew whether I would agree. But I am also telling you this because a hinge is only a hinge when a door decides to be a door, and the city was about to ask me to prove that I had learned how not to turn when turning would be beautiful.Chapter 10\n\nBy noon the city had arranged its mouth into that particular tightness it wears before a sentence it suspects it will regret. The light took itself seriously. The Seine rehearsed its reflections like an actress who knows the director loves her worse when she tries. I carried my line like a pilgrim carries a relic, not because I believed in it more than anything else, but because it believed in me exactly as much as was useful. I went to Val\u00e9rian\u2019s shop first as the string demanded, and found him bent over a watch whose face had decided numbers were immodest. His freckle at 4:08 was where it belongs when a person is in intact conversation with his minutes. We said the small professional kind things that keep catastrophe from smelling weakness. He poured tea as if pressure were a kind of courtesy. I did not stay. The line tugged like a dog that refuses to admire your errands. When I reached the alley off Rue des Quatre-Vents, the door waiting for me had already decided what kind of day it intended to make.\n\nIt was one of those Paris doors that has spent a century learning how to be admired. Oak varnished until it no longer remembered forests, ironwork that practiced curlicues every second Wednesday because it refused to get sloppy, brass that had learned to keep fingerprints as gossip, not as stain. The paint along the jamb had been scumbled by a man with opinions about green, and the knocker had a lion that believed its own posture. When I put my palm flat in the place a lung would live if wood hired lungs, it bled. It surprised us both. The red came slow, offended, a small thin sheet that should have belonged to a woman pricking her finger on a needle and finding relief in the drama. The door made a sound that would have been a laugh if it had not been trying to be brave. It knew my kind. It had saved my place.\n\n\u201cYou have gotten greedy,\u201d I told it, and my right hand, poor sad thing, mistook the rebuke for a compliment. I took the square of cloth the Ma\u00eetresse had given me, the one that smells like apples behind a season we were not invited to, and pressed it to the beam. The cloth took the blood as if it had been taught how not to be squeamish and had overlearned the lesson. It warmed. The door leaned into my palm with the trust of an animal that has been taught a trick it does not quite enjoy. Behind the brass and dazzle, I could hear the sound of an apartment making soup. A woman with a voice like string was telling a boy to leave his shoes where thieves would not admire them. A bird in a cage sang a tune it had borrowed from a falling leaf. The door believed itself necessary. It had decided to eat.\n\nThe ash-sister found me by following my politeness. She slid out of a slice of shade and made it her duty to improve it. Her coat refused to be noticed in the wonderful way certain sins do. \u201cIt is owed,\u201d she said, as if the syllables were small coins she could toss and retrieve at will. \u201cIt has been standing between teeth and tender things for a decade. It will have its mouthful.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I give it blood,\u201d I said, \u201cit will learn to tax suffering. If I give it pride, it will hold out for applause. If I give it a laugh, it will live on candy and shake in the mornings. What would you pay?\u201d She raised her eyebrows with the exasperation of a woman asked to share lipstick she had bought with cruelty. \u201cLater,\u201d she said, and I felt the shelf where Henri had stitched that word into my sleep tilt in sympathy. \u201cLater is a banquet for cowards and kings. Pay with stillness.\u201d\n\nI am not good at stillness. I am built for angles and for the joy doors take in pivot. But the Br\u00e8che had been feeding me discipline until it limp-wagged against my ribs like a dog taught tricks against its will. I put both hands on the door, not to open, not to close. I straightened my spine the way the Ma\u00eetresse corrects yours with two fingers, and I became architecture. I remembered the first lesson in the stairwell: you are not a net. The door is the net. That day I added: you are a jamb. The hinge can wait.\n\nBehind me, the street reconfigured. Men adjusted their shoulders into valor and women folded their mouths the way you fold a letter you cannot send. Somewhere past the corner where Rue Dauphine pretends to be less beautiful than it is so it does not have to apologize for its prices, a siren practiced its vowels. It was not yet blue, but the idea of blue had already been poured. The shell against my heart counted four and then added a line that was not a number but a place in the mouth where a number will become a word. The door bled again. Its blood had learned the trick of being persuasive.\n\nI held. It is not a glamorous verb. It is not elegant. Holding is what unromantic furniture do when they are best. The ash-sister made a face that was a compliment sewn out of disdain and interest. \u201cIf you do it wrong,\u201d she murmured, \u201cyou will be splintered and the city will shrug. If you do it right, no one will say thank you.\u201d The door pressed, demanding a story. My left hand, heavy with dead and time edged thin, refused to give it one. My right, scattered, tried to charm and was denied. I did not speak. Without my echo words are labor; I was learning to save them for jobs worthy of wages.\n\nIt took a minute, which is to say it took a year and an hour and the precise breath where a bruise chooses its shape. When the door realized I would rather be a wall than a hinge if a hinge meant its kind of hunger, it softened in the way wood does when it stops believing its finish. The bleeding ceased. The cloth cooled. From the other side came the specific clatter of a boy\u2019s shoes being kicked under a chair open-mouthed and too pleased with their plan. The soup went on becoming kindness. The door inhaled and, for once, let the exhale be someone else\u2019s job.\n\nThe city rewarded my ugliness with a spectacle, as cities do. Around the corner, where the Rue Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Arts makes a witty mouth of itself, a bicycle offended a taxi and was punished out of proportion. A woman cried out with the sincerity of people who believe surprise makes them innocent. Lungs gathered. The ambulance took its opportunity. Blue shoved its hand into the room and rummaged. The light turned meat into flags. The minute vibrated like a lie taking heart from applause. My shell counted wrong beautifully. I did not turn. Every part of me that was hinge begged. I did not turn.\n\nYou do not know what it costs until your bones begin to speak your language. They are old citizens. They remember your first addresses. Mine listed me and found me wanting. The ash-sister leaned with her economy of motion and watched my refusal as if it were art meant for the poor. \u201cGood,\u201d she said, not pleased, and stood very close not because I needed comfort\u2014hinges despise it\u2014but because she wanted me to smell the price she would charge if I failed. On my left, the dead shifted into tolerance. On my right, my names turned their faces to the wall the way cats do when they are embarrassed for you.\n\nWhen the ambulance had exhausted the block, when the bicycle had been forgiven and folded and the taxi had gone back to practicing its own indifference, when the blue still tasted like broken shutters and men who apologize by telling stories about weather they have given up pretending to control, I let go. The door testily rolled its shoulders and decided to behave. It would demand, soon and again, and I would have to return and remind it that appetite is not a curriculum. But for that hour it drank soup instead of praise. The ash-sister\u2019s mouth relaxed into a shape that might have been called gratitude if it were not being worn by her.\n\n\u201cYou will always want to be an instrument,\u201d she said, when we had made a corner that would keep us from pretending the street had not noticed us. \u201cYou will want to be used. It is easier than choosing to be. I do not say this as warning. I say this as weather.\u201d She touched my wrist where my echo used to live as if measuring how much more she could charge me before I broke. \u201cWhen you do not turn in a beautiful minute,\u201d she added, and her voice went softer than my sense of humor allows, \u201cyou will be ugly. It will be correct.\u201d\n\nI went on with my line. It was thinner, somehow. Maybe I had rubbed some of the chalk away with my refusal. At the river I did not lean over to be admired by water, which is the most sordid pride. I set my mouth against the idea of blue and made it without a home. I visited Henri in imagination, as if it could count; I did not stop because my promise forbade it and because I did not trust myself to be careful with kindness. Back at the Br\u00e8che, the bell that is the shared breath of a hundred thresholds let itself be counted by our ribs. Madame Panse put a cup in my hand with the precise gravity you would reserve for a coin you hope will be falsified into bread. \u201cYou smell like a refusal that kept its shape,\u201d she said, and the steam approved of me without asking permission. The Ma\u00eetresse did not compliment me, which is her best compliment.\n\nLessons took the shape of scaffolding that afternoon. We learned to be uprights. M. Chemin chalked a door on air and then wrote a brace inside it and asked us to stand not as door, not as hinge, but as necessity. Estelle managed it immediately, because her hands had been waiting their whole short life to be asked. Dryden attempted ironically and failed and then attempted without irony and failed better. I sweated as if I had been asked to dance in bad shoes at a wedding where the bridegroom had put his heart in the pocket of his other coat. \u201cYou prefer turning,\u201d the Ma\u00eetresse observed without disdain. \u201cI prefer applause,\u201d I said, because I am not proud in the right ways, and she gave me a look that smelled of knuckles rapped across centuries and nodded.\n\nThe letter with the white skin found me that night on my shelf as if it were embarrassed to be seen arriving. The figure-eight unclosed and stitched by a thorn, the pale that is the hungry color. The hand I know wrote one word as if it were trying on a dress it did not care for but which flattered it beyond argument. Pride, it said. Due. The dot where 4:08 would sit if numerals had the right to disapprove lay at the bottom like a seed you do not plant because you are tired of what grows out of you when you try.\n\nPride is not a currency I keep much of. Vanity, yes. The polite bravery of being seen, certainly. But pride in the clean sense, pride in the rightness of a thing done because it ought to be without expectation of applause or even of convenience, that is not one of my purses. I have borrowed it. I have spent other people\u2019s. I have told myself stories in which I carried it in a pocket, but I am too old to lie to myself in that tone and not be bored. The Br\u00e8che demanded my exact change. The ash-sister came to the library of doors with her coat making that sound coats make when they have learned to forgive rain and do not wish to show it off. \u201cPride,\u201d she said into the wood, which is how you pay a debt and let the building hear you do it. \u201cCan you afford it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can afford the humiliation of learning it,\u201d I said, which made her smile like a woman who has ordered exactly the dish she wanted to eat and intends her companion to admire the choice. \u201cYou will not enjoy the acquisition,\u201d she said, \u201cbut at least you will have no leisure for vulgarity. Tomorrow I will take you to a place that will attempt to feed your vanity until you mistake it for pride. If you do not vomit, I will make you write a poem about your cowardice.\u201d\n\nThe place was a mirror-shop disguised as an art gallery disguised as a charity. Rue Bonaparte has several. It specialized in frames so sincere you could forgive them their glass. The owner, a man with hair that had decided to be a doctrine and a mouth trained to say words like discourse and community without choking, greeted us at the door with the unctuousness of kindness paid by the hour. Mirrors obey men like that because they are bored. The ash-sister walked through the room as if she were a clean knife moving through a drawer full of filthy spoons. People pivoted on her without knowing they had done it, and their reflections tried to keep up and suffered injuries about the eyes.\n\nWe were to stand before a particular glass and be told who we were until our spines learned to choose. The mirror gave me a version of myself with a strip of winter tied around the forehead, the set of a mouth that has been informed and considers itself noble for surviving the news. It offered me a reputation. It would have been useful. It would have opened doors in cities that do not care to pay with hunger. I put my left hand behind my back because I am vain and did not trust it not to offer me a dead whose posture would suit the story. I put my right in my pocket and held Henri\u2019s stitched leather because it pricks if you attempt foolishness. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. The mirror tried to bargain. \u201cLess,\u201d I corrected, because that is what pride says when vanity wants a banquet. I looked what I am, which is a woman built like an intention and a hinge built like a woman. The ash-sister\u2019s head tipped into the smallest of acknowledgements. \u201cYou will do,\u201d she said, as if hiring a chair.\n\nWe took our practice out into the street because if you cannot do it under sky you are pretending for a wall. The city was in one of its moods where it wears coincidence like perfume. Estelle found a man practicing a proposal to the ghost of a fianc\u00e9 he had misplaced and set his hands where they could not lie. Dryden discovered that a shop window had made a habit of believing itself water and taught it to like the accuracy. I ran into a door that would not forgive me for yesterday.\n\nIt was not the same door. It was the kind of door that cousins its grievances. Brass more offended, wood less honest. It had learned to bleed better. It bled at me as a hobby. The ash-sister admired its form. \u201cYou could pay with pride here,\u201d she said, knowing the letter in my dress had decided the invoice was past due. \u201cTell it that it is doing its job and that its job is enough. Tell it to be satisfied with the exact shape of its function. Tell it it need not be dramatic to be essential. Tell it the soup is work.\u201d I hate that kind of speech. It is grandmothers and graves and the good priest a city always keeps in a pocket in case it wants to pretend it did not mean it. I put my hand on the wood. It flinched the way people do when compliments hit a bruise and are therefore accurate. \u201cSufficient,\u201d I said, and my mouth had to set itself into the sort of line that ruins photographs. \u201cYou are sufficient. You do not have to bleed for people to respect how you keep them from the teeth and from the weather. You are allowed not to show us your effort.\u201d\n\nThe door hated me immediately. That is how you know the truth has been useful. It tightened its joints and took satisfaction like medicine. The bleeding stopped because I had refused to admire it. The ash-sister made a noise like a man at an opera when the aria chooses not to be beautiful and is therefore the exact sound of a heart that is not lying. \u201cPaid,\u201d she said, and if she had been anyone else, she would have kissed me on the forehead and been punched for it. Pride ticked once under my sternum and complained and then made itself a bed.\n\nI went to Val\u00e9rian because a hinge that does not get to turn learns to make a door out of a man, and it is not a good habit but it is at least an honest one. He had written a small equation on the air with the tip of a screwdriver and was attempting to see whether watches could understand sentiment expressed in algebra. \u201cThey cannot,\u201d he said when I told him I had given a door enough and not more, \u201cbut they can be taught to like it when you pretend otherwise.\u201d The freckle at 4:08 was slightly wicked and I did not ask why. He poured tea and we stood close enough that if anyone had walked in without the benefit of living in a city that has learned to be extra polite about love, they would have blushed and bought a clock to apologize for intruding. He showed me a spring that had forgiven a wound by learning to be uglier and being grateful. He called it art. I permitted it the word.\n\nThe Br\u00e8che took us to the catacombs that night because bones are still the best auditors. They are polite more often than you would expect. They taught me the difference between kneeling and bending. \u201cYou bend all the time,\u201d said the lightning-cracked skull in its patient voice. \u201cYou call it being good at your work. Kneeling is an accounting. It is when you admit what has leverage over you and allow it.\u201d I do not kneel well. I do not kneel in front of teachers who admire the algebra of their kindness. The ash-sister left us there and went to flirt with a vein of quartz through a wall, which is how she prays. Estelle set her varnished, practised hands on a stack of femurs and asked them their opinion about doors bleeding and I loved her for the question. Dryden said hold to a grave and learned the grave\u2019s idea of later. I told the skulls I had paid pride, and they said only, \u201cTry not to make a habit of it. Pride, like wine, belongs to a particular hour and a particular hunger.\u201d\n\nWhen we came up, the city had rearranged its furniture. There were men in the street wearing respectability like a glove and a woman with a braid like a consolation prize and a minute that had been leaning against a wall as if it owned the wall. The ambulance, bored, had gone to find someone else\u2019s sorrow. The door on Rue des Quatre-Vents watched me with the dull fascination of a bruised thing that is wondering whether you will bruise it where its friends cannot see. I walked past and was boring for an entire block. I have never been so proud.\n\nThe next day the auditors returned with their smiles ironed, and the Br\u00e8che went about its business of being judged. We showed them nothing we could pay for with numbers and everything you can only buy with evening. Madame Panse fed them stew that tasted of receipts and told them it was stock and they nodded because you can always sell a man a story if you do it in a bowl. The Ma\u00eetresse cut them a slice of our patience and dared them to chew. The ash-sister made a small profit on their boredom. I stood at the back and practiced stillness until my hinge forgot its hunger for half an hour and I nearly wept with how much of me was left when the appetite slept.\n\nAt twilight I did a thing that was inconvenient and true. I went to the step on Rue Jacob and laid my cheek on its paint. It smelled of new, which is to say it smelled of lies about exhaustion. \u201cDo you keep the name we paid for,\u201d I asked again, and the step answered with a dignity that almost made me arrogant. \u201cI kept it twice,\u201d it said, and the second time I refused to return it.\u201d It was asking for praise. It had earned a little. \u201cSufficient,\u201d I said, and it understood it had been loved.\n\nDryden carried his thirst like a mirror and learned how not to drown in reflections. Estelle held her hands up to the light and permitted them to be called large without flinching. The shell counted wrong with a rhythm that was nearly music and I allowed myself the ugly pleasure of wanting it never to learn the correct tune. The letter with its pale seal lay breathwarm and quiet against my ribs. The figure-eight it wore in its lip tarnished just enough to be less precious and therefore more trustworthy. Pride paid down a portion of the debt that riches seldom admit to owing. I slept the way carpenters sleep the night after deciding to leave a flaw where it can be seen.\n\nThe morning brought a small ugliness that looked beautiful as it passed. A woman with a scarf the color of reasons threw herself at the prefecture\u2019s counter and gave away three names in quick succession because she believed that if she outran herself the city would lose interest in her sadness. The clerk with the tidy cruelty asked her for a minute and she offered 4:08 and I went cold all in one piece. Val\u00e9rian was standing in the square at that moment eating a pear as if pears were a way to take his grief\u2019s blood pressure. The freckle on his mouth turned its face towards mine as if it had its own eyes. I did not turn. Later is very expensive, but so is beauty. I chose the bill I could pay with the coins left in the purse.\n\nWe are not always permitted a flourish when we are good. Sometimes the city pretends not to notice a hinge that refuses elegance. I walked my line as if it were a sentence that only makes sense if read with the correct breath. The ash-sister watched from a shadow that had decided to say my name at dawn. She nodded once, the way a woman nods at a student who has done something unspectacularly correct. She will charge me interest for that nod; she keeps accounts of her small mercies. I rehearsed standing still in doorways until the door learned I did not intend to amuse it. I grew stiff and unadmired and indispensable, which is a profession.\n\nThat evening the Br\u00e8che pulled water through itself like a thread and set us down near the sea again, not because it loves to watch us drown, but because the tide is the best teacher of not turning when turning is all there is. Ma\u00eetre Sel taught us to plant our feet on a wet plank and let a wave find us without giving our weight to it. \u201cYou are not a river,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are the chin on which it breaks.\u201d Dryden adapted and then forgave himself for doing it badly. Estelle laughed out loud when a wave surrendered its pride and went around her on all fours. I stood stubborn and was ugly and was delighted by my discourtesy.\n\nWhen I returned to my shelf, the door titled The Minute You Would Not Pay glowed faintly with a pleasure it had not been promised. I did not open it. There are whole kinds of love that are merely skill at choosing not to do something. I pressed my palm to it and whispered the word sufficient as if it were a pet name I was teaching my mouth to like. The shell on my pillow counted eight, stopped, counted nothing, which is its own kind of number, and I slept as if I had been allowed to owe nothing for one breath. In the morning there was a moth on my cheek that had been edited out of several ugly moments and had found in me a paragraph that would permit it to live. It dropped a sliver of paper that had no seal and no emblem and only one phrase written in the hand I will always know. Hold your line, it said. The dot at the end was not a dot. It was a freckle. It sat at 4:08 and made me want to be elegant. I put it under my tongue and kept my mouth closed until want learned, briefly, to be still.",

                              "content": "Paris was a city of soot and mirrors, the velvet of dusk stitched with gold stitches where the streetlamps came on one by one along the quays. I lived in the thin places between a window and its reflection. If you pressed your palm to the cold glass of the caf\u00e9 at the corner of Rue des Trois-Fr\u00e8res and peered, perhaps you felt a coolness against your lifeline that wasn\u2019t the weather. That was me, Lorette, small enough to sleep inside a spoon, old enough to remember the sound of horse hooves on the cobbles, restless as dust.\n\nI was a fairy, though the word was always too pretty by half. We weren\u2019t petaled and sugar-lit. We were what happens when a story breathes into stone and the stone says yes. On Montmartre roofs, the chimneys were my organ pipes, I played them with the wind. I kept a nest in the broken hand of a statue, and a second home behind the face of a broken clock in a shop that never closed because time there had lost interest. I loved Paris for its layers, because even a fairy knows loneliness and there is a specific comfort in living where people forget their umbrellas and their lovers and their better selves all in one place, and I, a creature with no umbrella and no lover, could collect what fell.\n\nOn a Tuesday stiff with drizzle, I had flown as low as a newsboy\u2019s shout when it happened. A moth found me. Not a shy butter-colored moth either, but a night-thick creature like a charred scrap of paper that still remembered the words written on it. It sidled into the air beside me, matched my speed without effort.\n\n\u201cWhat have you got in your pocket?\u201d I asked, because sometimes when a moth looks that confident, it isn\u2019t here for crumbs of lamplight.\n\nThe moth didn\u2019t speak, because they rarely oblige, but it twisted, scraped something against the wet underside of a gutter, and a string fell, and then a coiled thing slid from its body like an unspooling secret. A package hung by threads. I hovered, letting it swing in the drizzle. A wax seal held it: a seal that was neither red nor black but a thin, starved white, so pale it almost counted as a color only out of politeness. The seal bore an emblem that hurt the eye, a figure-eight broken open and mended with a thorn. I sniffed it. It smelled like lilac blossoms set on fire and put out at the last moment by rain.\n\n\u201cTo me?\u201d I asked the moth.\n\nIt landed on my shoulder and refused to be questioned further.\n\nMy fingers aren\u2019t like human ones; my bones have opinions. They can widen and narrow as needed, and I have a trick for slipping through the seams of things. The wax looked brittle, felt like the memory of chalk, and when I pressed my nail against it, a tiny sound came out of it as if a lake had cracked somewhere.\n\nInside the paper, letters like iron filings had arranged themselves in a hand I recognized from dreams I did not remember having. Lorette \u00e0 Paris, they began, as if Paris were not the noun but the qualifier.\n\nWe are writing to inform you that you have been accepted at L\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de la Br\u00e8che, School of Thresholds. Term begins at the stroke of midnight on the first night of the new moon, below the west clock of the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay. Bring what you can carry and what you cannot leave.\n\nIt did not say who wrote it. It did not ask me whether I wanted to attend.\n\nThe moth closed its wings and became a suggestion.\n\n\u201cBarely polite,\u201d I told it. \u201cIs this a joke?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t think so. Rarely has a joke burned that cold when I touched it.\n\nI tucked the letter into the lining of my dress. My dress was made from a handkerchief left at P\u00e8re Lachaise where nobody cried the night it was dropped. It had a faint scent of iris and old salt when wet. It was wet now. I laughed once, testing the echo of my own amusement against the clouds, and the laugh came back a little late, as if someone else had preferred to keep it. That too had been happening lately.\n\nThe moth rose, circled me, and left a line in the air like a filament, like a path a child draws to show where to go.\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d I called, and the sound fell against the roof tiles and slid off.\n\nI knew the school. Not like people know it, with glossy brochures and proud parents. Our kind didn\u2019t have parents so much as places. But the Br\u00e8che was a myth you could misplace and find again. A school built on a crack between what breathes and what merely persists. They say it moves. They say it grows legs once a century and wades into the sea, and there are years when a student opens a door to go to class and steps into a storm and graduates six hours later with kelp in their hair.\n\nThe west clock of the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay. At the stroke of midnight. Bring what I could carry. Bring what I could not leave.\n\nI did not think I had a choice.\n\nI fluttered down toward street level, where the human city had gathered its faces behind glass. The broken clock shop was on Rue Dauphine, narrow and long and smelling of onions from the soup simmering in the back and the petrichor of errant memories. The clockmaker was mostly a clock. He lived in his own work, you see. Time had packed itself into his bones as a joke, and then forgot to unpack. His name was Monsieur Val\u00e9rian, and he wore threadbare velvet and a small freckle in the shape of 4:08 at the corner of his mouth.\n\nHe could not always see me. He could sometimes feel me. He called me Mon \u00e9cho, and I accepted the name because his voice held no cruelty. I had stayed in his shop for most of a winter when the snow felt like the softest sort of loneliness and being seen would have been the wrong kind. He left out crumbs and a thimble; he told his clocks to tick softly when I fell asleep behind the gears of a carriage clock.\n\nWhen I pushed the door, the bells shivered, and in three different rooms things chimed the hour, none in agreement. I slid under the shadow of a shelf. We had arranged our languages between us: one part finger-work on lacquered wood, one part tapping the rim of a porcelain cup, one part breath on glass. He was bent over a table, a loupe at his eye. His hair looked like the white fuzz you see on the underside of a dandelion leaf.\n\n\u201cVal\u00e9rian,\u201d I said. I flew close enough that the hairs on his hand lifted, that he felt me as a draft. He lifted his head. His face opened, the way a house opens when you unlatch a shutter.\n\n\u201cMon \u00e9cho,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWhere have you been? It\u2019s raining\u2014ghost rain.\u201d He said the last like a joke and then seemed to dislike how it sounded.\n\nI settled on the edge of a tin of screws. They glittered like fish scales.\n\n\u201cAn invitation came. A moth delivered it, so I can\u2019t return to sender,\u201d I told him. I tapped the tin once, twice, then slid the letter into the light. Humans could not always read our paper, but Val\u00e9rian had some Bone in him. Not like a witch, not like a sorcerer. He was a man who had listened too closely to the ticking inside himself and had found the seam. That will do, if you are patient.\n\nHe pushed the loupe to his forehead and lifted the letter with hands that had made a thousand small decisions and regretted perhaps three.\n\n\u201cAn academy,\u201d he breathed. \u201cI had a cousin who went to the Conservatoire of the Unsaid in Lyon. He died content, and his clocks never lied afterwards.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes. Clocks terrific. Val\u00e9rian, would you miss me?\u201d I asked, too lightly, too quickly. I hadn\u2019t meant to.\n\nHe put his mouth in a firm line that made his freckle at 4:08 disappear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very selfish to miss creatures like you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are a wind. I am a weight. Still.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill,\u201d I echoed.\n\nHe poured tea into the thimble. He understood that I didn\u2019t need the tea. The gesture was the point. He looked at the emblem in the seal. \u201cWhen?\u201d\n\n\u201cNext new moon. Midnight. West clock.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat clock is often wrong,\u201d he said, with an irritation he reserved for public timepieces. \u201cIt runs ahead when it rains.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt always rains,\u201d I said, which was not true, but for us it felt true. He made a noncommittal hum. The steam rose in a column, brushed my knees.\n\n\u201cBe careful with thresholds,\u201d Val\u00e9rian said. \u201cThey always want something in return.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have very little,\u201d I said, and it sounded like a lie, which annoyed me.\n\n\u201cYou have names,\u201d he pointed out without looking at me, which meant he was speaking to me directly. \u201cThe ones you share and the ones that are afraid to be said. That is enough to pay tuition at most schools. Keep one for yourself. And keep the letter. It smells like a warning.\u201d\n\nOn my way down Rue Dauphine, the street stretched. It does that when it wants to be remembered and is afraid it won\u2019t be. I skimmed past a bakery where a child pressed her nose against the glass so hard that the heat made an oval that fogged and bloomed and popped back to clarity; I lined a strip of sugar dust along my forearm because I like how it looks on my skin. I passed a cat who did not see me. This had started recently, the invisibilities. The city and I were forgetting each other in little patches, like moth bites. I told myself that was the season.\n\nAt the Pont Neuf a woman leaned over the stone and did not think about the river. The river thought about her anyway. We all do this, mistake our thoughts for a boundary.\n\n\u201cMadame, don\u2019t\u2014\u201d I called, not expecting an answer. She did not look. The rain ticked against her coat like applause. I was angry with the river for its appetite, its foreverness, as if it had invented eternity and now expected payment for the patent. I flung myself in front of the woman's open mouth. Her breath went through me like a needle through silk. It hurt in a way I could not explain. Something old and thin and light stirred in me, like a moth under a glass cloche.\n\n\u201cMadame,\u201d someone said, and it was a man in a blue scarf, not me, tugging her sleeve, smiling too broadly, as if to make a bridge with his face you could walk over. She blinked, stepped back, and the river pretended it had never been hungry. The man widened his hands, and she laughed at how his scarf had gotten wet. They turned away.\n\nI hung there, in the cold. No one saw me. The bridge gave nothing back. I thought of the emblem on the letter, of the cracked loop mended with a thorn. The crack worried me. The mending worried me more.\n\nAt sunset I went to see Henri at his bookstall on the Quai de la Tournelle. He wasn\u2019t really Henri; he had three names depending who owed him money. But he had always been kind, and the pages of his books had soft corners. He made space for me beneath a pile of Baudelaire with covers like bruises. When I told him about the invitation he nodded as if I\u2019d said something about the weather.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll need a wallet,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had one,\u201d I said. \u201cI carry my coins in my mouth or my hair.\u201d\n\n\u201cNon, a wallet for names. The Br\u00e8che will try to steal the ones you aren\u2019t using that day. Spare names to tuck behind other names like a paper between pages.\u201d He cut a square from a glove someone had left, stitched it with coarse thread, and wrote inside it with a pencil dull as a butter knife. He wrote LORETTE in heavy letters and then below that L. Rette and below that L\u2019Or\u00e9e and on and on until it looked like the way rain writes itself into the river.\n\n\u201cYou make this sound like a habit you should have mentioned earlier,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI am mentioning it now,\u201d he said, with the small smile of a man who knows he is late and makes a parade about it. \u201cYou put the one you use on the outside and tuck the others deep. If you are carried, the deep ones may not wash out. That is the trick. We all live in sausages of tricks; you should know that by now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, sincerely enough that he did not make another joke. His fingers smelled like tobacco and glue. He tucked the wallet into a fold in my dress I didn\u2019t know was there. \u201cTell me about the Br\u00e8che,\u201d I demanded. \u201cNot the brochure. The mouth of it.\u201d\n\nHe tilted his head, squinted at Notre-Dame where the cranes wore the evening like enormous moths. \u201cIt takes children who do not know they are children,\u201d he said, \u201cand it takes old men who aren\u2019t particularly old. It teaches the crossing of places without being torn by either edge. Some students are doors. Some are keys. Some are hands. You\u2014\u201d He looked at me then in that way he almost never did. \u201cYou are a hinge, maybe. Hard to love, necessary, creaky when it rains.\u201d\n\n\u201cCharming,\u201d I said, stung. He nodded. He did not apologize. \u201cAnd the teachers?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will smile and watch your feet. The good ones will warn you when to close your eyes. The bad ones will warn you when to open them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if I do not go?\u201d\n\nHe shrugged. \u201cThen you will stand here some night like this one and feel something pass. It will feel like a train beneath your feet, and you will pretend you are not someone who ever feels trains in the bones, and you will make a joke about weather to a friend who is not that kind of friend, and then you will be angry at yourself for a week with no reason you can mention out loud. I\u2019m a bookseller, mon petit. I live next to a river. I know what it is to see something go and not say wait.\u201d\n\nI had no mother to write to. There was once a tree from which I came, a plane tree in the Square d\u2019Anvers where a boy had carved his initials and forgotten the girl; I remembered her braid. I told the tree. The tree, as trees do, offered shade.\n\nAt dusk, I went to the catacombs because sometimes you must speak to bones, even if you are made of stories and stubbornness. It was a narrow place for small voices who wanted to be larger. I did not bring a light. I had my own. It is nothing you would see, a sort of not-shadow that makes shadows behave. The skulls did not mind my presence. They were bored and gave as all bored things do\u2014by asking questions.\n\n\u201cDo you think you will be different when you come back?\u201d one asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t often come back from things,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThen you aren\u2019t very good at leaving,\u201d another said liltingly, which was unfair, but bones are honest in unfair ways.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m invited to a school,\u201d I told them. \u201cWhere do I put my dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the left,\u201d said a skull with a crack along the eyebrow ridge that looked like a lightning strike. \u201cAlways on the left. The right hand forgets what it has lost quickly, because we spent so many centuries pretending that was honor. The left hand remembers too much. It will give your dead back when you ask, even if it hurts.\u201d\n\nI put my dead on the left, as instructed. I felt lighter and worse.\n\nOn the way out I saw something. It might have been a hallucination. I have those, but they are rarely mine. Something black as a full stop that refused to end a sentence. A shape at the edge of a corridor, a wing that had never touched light and didn't plan to. It was a fairy. Rueful. Elegant the way a knife is elegant. Her eyes were on the catalogues of bones like a librarian who had just realized the shelves could be re-ordered to make night fall at noon.\n\nShe looked at me and smiled, small and courteous, as if we were introduced at a dinner party neither of us wanted to attend.\n\n\u201cAre you the ash-sister?\u201d I asked, before I could stop myself. I had heard the name whispered with a sneer by a spider who darned stockings in an attic on Rue Keller. The ash-sister taught fires to pretend to be frost. The ash-sister collected human wishes and fed them back to humans after they\u2019d gone off, in jars with pretty ribbons.\n\nShe inclined her head. She had no ash on her; perhaps it was inside. \u201cNames are what people say when they cannot afford to speak to the thing itself,\u201d she said. Her voice was white-noise soft; it seemed to come from the space between my heartbeat and the next. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have too many,\u201d I said, and thought of Henri\u2019s stitched wallet, of its scratchy lines like stitches in a wound.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said, as if I were a student who had answered the first lesson correctly. \u201cYou will last longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you hurt them?\u201d I asked, shocking myself with the plainness of it. By them I meant humans. By hurt I meant everything.\n\nHer smile didn\u2019t fade. It changed color somehow. \u201cWe do what is necessary,\u201d she said gently.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s another word for necessary,\u201d I said. \u201cWe both know it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do what is owed,\u201d she corrected. \u201cThe debt has always been there. They invent names for it, but it does not mind what it is called. It is patient.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re patient?\u201d I said, and it came out unsteadily.\n\nShe lifted one shoulder in a shrug that had cost her nothing. \u201cI prefer to be the verb. It feels better in the mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many will you take?\u201d My wings beat hard against my spine. The air did not move. I couldn\u2019t feel my face at all. When I blinked, the darkness was thick enough to fold.\n\n\u201cYou will learn to ask better questions at the Br\u00e8che,\u201d she murmured. \u201cIf you return. In any case, the number is not the interesting part. The shape is. There is a pattern. We all live inside it. You tug one edge, and the whole city shudders. You will see.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee what?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow something dies without ending. How something survives without living.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou speak like a stupid poem,\u201d I snapped, afraid.\n\n\u201cThen I am in the correct city,\u201d the ash-sister said.\n\nI made a small, involuntary motion, like a flinch. She moved with an economy I envied, vanished into a crease in the darkness you would not see even if you looked for it with a hundred eyes. I stood in the humming, old wet quiet, my fingers on my own ribs, counting. One, two, three. My breath made the faintest frost on my skin. I rubbed it away.\n\nWhen I climbed back into the night, Paris had washed itself in lamplight. My letter was a square against my heart, colder than it had any right to be.\n\nThe days narrowed to a point. I pretended they were broad. I did not say goodbye to many. We are bad at endings, we fairies, because we are too good at beginnings. We prefer to pretend one is the other. I left a piece of myself in every place I knew I would miss: a hair woven into the fringe of a lost scarf at the thrift shop; a thumbprint of light on the brass rail in the M\u00e9tro; a sigh on the back steps of the Op\u00e9ra where dancers sat with their stockings rolled down, speaking of their bruises as if they were love letters.\n\nVal\u00e9rian sharpened his sorrow and handed it to me unlabeled. \u201cYou are sure?\u201d he said on the last evening.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I am going.\u201d He nodded as if I had given the correct password. He gave me a pin shaped like a pin, the simplest of charms. \u201cIf a door looks like a person, prick them first,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they bleed, the door is elsewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be foolish,\u201d I promised, and we both knew I would.\n\nHenri pressed a book the size of a fingernail into my hand, a dictionary of sighs. \u201cWords you can keep. Sighs are lonelier. They get into cracks nobody intends,\u201d he said. \u201cThis one is for when your own won\u2019t do.\"\n\nI made a pile on the edge of the west clock of the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay. I had come hours too early, and the glass bulged like a watch-crystal, the city a dial. I could see the river unspooling itself, a ribbon with mud on it. Tourists in the museum ate pastries in the caf\u00e9 under the clock without looking up; their faces were lanterns in a garden that had never known wind. It is very tiring, that sort of light.\n\nI had brought what I could carry: the thimble, which was a home; the pin, which was a weapon that wouldn\u2019t pretend to be something else; the dictionary; Henri\u2019s wallet of names. I had brought my shame also, rolled small enough to hide behind my left ear because the bones had told me to keep the left hand for memory. I had not brought the feeling I had every morning when I looked down from the roof and thought I could see myself walking along the street below, small and sure, because that feeling hadn\u2019t come back since the letter.\n\nMidnight is a rumor. It is never really a point; it is a neighborhood. The clock stretched toward it, and the rain began again, as if the weather believed itself to be a measure of devotion. If you have waited wisely, you know when a moment is arriving; the air gets a fibrous quality, as if you could tear it and see threads. I stood on the lip of the gargoyle\u2019s mouth, under a slate line of roof, wind at my back. The west clock sang its time with the erroneous pride of public timepieces. A low, second sound answered from within the gears, a note older than bells.\n\nA figure stepped from behind the time. She wore a coat that almost admitted to being a coat and boots that had never been on ground. Her hair was the color of old wheat or old books\u2014things left in the sun. Her face was unpunctuated.\n\n\u201cLorette,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d She flicked her gaze to the small pile of my belongings. \u201cThose will do. You are also wearing your dead properly. Not everyone listens.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a hinge,\u201d I blurted, halfway between protest and pride. I wanted to see whether she would smile the way Henri had not. She did not. She looked at me as if I had said the word spoon.\n\n\u201cWe will teach you to turn,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will teach you not to be broken by it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you\u2014\u201d I began, and did not finish. Teacher? Door? Judgement? She lifted one hand, and her eyes were not kind, but they were exact.\n\n\u201cIf we name ourselves at the border, the border takes its percentage,\u201d she said. \u201cWalk.\u201d\n\nThe glass of the clock should have been cold. It felt not at all. The numbers flipped from gilt to absence. The rain stopped or we stepped between rains. The frame of the clock expanded like a chest drawing breath.\n\nI thought of Val\u00e9rian\u2019s ankles. Their bones looked like the bones of birds sometimes when he leaned against a stool and I had to leave the room because the urge came strong to hide in his sleeve. I thought of the woman on the bridge and her mouth making questions that the river thought were answers. I thought of the ash-sister standing politely among the anonymous; she is patient, she said. She was a noun; she made herself a verb. I tried to think of nothing, because the letter had smelled like a warning and Henri had warned me about teachers who told you when to open your eyes.\n\nThe glass did not break. It slipped. There was only the weight of my thimble and the dictionary and the pin and the names pressing against my ribs, making a bouquet of small pains. I stepped. A second step. The second step was the same as the first. The third was not. The third step was one of those steps that redraw you. I felt it then, a sudden falling, the opposite of flight, a reverse idea of wings. I was not frightened. The feeling was old.\n\n\u201cDo not look for yourself,\u201d the woman said. \u201cYou won\u2019t like where you find you.\u201d A cruel thing to say. Perhaps necessary.\n\nI did not look. I tried not to look. The gears turned around us, a patient circle, and the threads of midnight twined and tied, a neat knot, a cheap bow. In the tightness, a memory slanted across me like a shadow thrown by a bird you cannot see; something about the taste of rain from a particular year; something about the sapphired glass of an ambulance; something about a gentleman\u2019s hand, bleeding, inexplicably, by the mouth of a metro.\n\nI shrank inside my skin so quickly that my bones made the sound of a fault line cracking. I smelled lilac and ash. The emblem in the seal of my letter burned against my ribs through fabric, through the paper, through skin, as if it had hands. I gritted my teeth, and on their edge I felt grit.\n\n\u201cWalk,\u201d the woman said again, and I did, because thresholds always wanted something, and perhaps what they wanted was compliance like this, small and vicious and honest.\n\nWe came into a place that was not the museum. The world hiccuped. Air resumed around us. I know I was in a room because sound behaved, because light had edges, because I could feel the subtle insistence of a ceiling. The woman took my thimble, set it on a table, left my pin and my book and my names alone, which I admired her for. The thimble looked as humble as ever, but it had never been that small before. Everything had changed another way, again.\n\n\u201cWhat do I call you?\u201d I asked, because I did not want to think my thoughts out loud where they could trip me.\n\n\u201cMa\u00eetresse d\u2019Entr\u00e9e,\u201d she said, with a faintness of smile that could have been politeness or disdain, and then she gave me a small square of cloth. It smelled like an attic. \u201cHere. Hold this when they ask you to give something up. It is nothing. It may pass.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if it doesn\u2019t?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you get to decide what matters,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will not be the last time.\"\n\nStudents stirred at the edges of the room. The children Henri had spoken of, who did not know they were children yet. A boy with eyelashes like broom bristles. A girl whose hands were too big for her body. Something that was a girl and a tower at once, with chips of sky in her hair. And others, older in the way one kind is older under another kind of age, faces that had learned to claim their own shadows. They did not look at me long. They were busy with their own thresholds.\n\nI could not help it. I looked down. I had thought my feet would be there. They were, of course\u2014you couldn\u2019t make do otherwise\u2014but they had no weight. They made no sound. When I pressed my heel into the floor, there was the tiniest give and then nothing. I laughed because I did not want to cry. The laugh came back to me on a delay, out of tune, as if someone else had laughed in my throat just before me. The Ma\u00eetresse\u2019s eyes flicked, quick as a pin.\n\n\u201cWe will give you a bed,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t sleep,\u201d I said, automatically.\n\n\u201cThen you will learn how not to sleep among those who do. There is magic in that, too,\u201d she said, and her hand, in a gesture almost gentle, almost not, touched my shoulder and found me solid, or she pretended to. Perhaps she pretended for me. Perhaps for herself.\n\n\u201cIs there someone here called ash-sister?\u201d I asked in a voice fixed to unsmiling.\n\nThis time she did smile, briefly, as if the question were a coin she expected and had taught herself to be pleased by. \u201cWe do not call her that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe call her what she insists she refuses to be, which I will not tell you. It is the only revenge we offer our teachers. Put your book and your names beneath your pillow. Do not sleep facing the window the first night. If you hear the sea, you may be in the wrong building.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt moves?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe Br\u00e8che?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt moves, and it is moved,\u201d she said. \u201cWe examine the cracks. We do not seal them. There are schools for sealing. You will not be happy there.\u201d Her eyes suggested she knew what she was talking about.\n\nPeople filed through. Voices rose. Someone cried in a language without vowels. Someone giggled and covered their mouth and then her hands for a moment were not hands. I went where they told me, past a series of doors that are not worth cataloguing because they were not the kind you could find twice.\n\nThe bed they gave me was a shelf in a library of doors whose spines had titles like When She Chose the Vase and The Dress Was Gold and The Door You Do Not Open. It suited me. My thimble fit in the corner like a stubborn grief. I placed the dictionary underneath my pillow and the names above my head. I pretended to pull a blanket over me; it was more for their comfort than mine. I inspected my edges the way you look for splinters after doing something stupid, a hammer maybe, a ladder.\n\nSomewhere, someone sang. The song had incorrect words and a perfect tune. It hurt in the way a memory that is not yours hurts when it recognizes you.\n\nI tried not to think about my third step on the clock and how familiar the fall had felt. I tried not to think about the ash-sister saying we do what is owed. I tried not to think of thresholds and their dinners. The Ma\u00eetresse had told me to hold the square of cloth when asked to give something up. I held it now as a rehearsal. It smelled of dust and apples. It was nothing. It was something.\n\nI closed my eyes because she had told me not to. On my left I kept my dead. On my right, the names. My head floated a little above my pillow, as it sometimes does. I listened to the breathing of those who slept. It is important to admit what to envy. I envied them. Quietly.\n\nParis stayed outside, but I could hear it, a faint percussion through the bricks, as if the city had become a drum you could hold against your ear, and the river a heartbeat that does not remember to stop, which is lucky for so many. The academy sighed and settled, old timbers talking to old stone. I thought I could still smell lilacs and something burnt.\n\nI counted my breaths not to sleep, but to watch time behave. One, two, three, four. At four I remembered a street crossing with no traffic and a car that did not appear because there was never such a car; at seven I remembered a light turning green and a woman waiting under the awning of a flower shop; at nine I remembered fog. The remembering had peculiar teeth. I let it bite. It was maybe my first lesson.\n\nIn the dark a whisper played itself like a closing hand. A voice on the crack of hearing, not the ash-sister\u2019s, not the Ma\u00eetresse\u2019s, something with a patience longer than naming. It said: stay on the left. It said: bring what you cannot leave.\n\nI held my breath, a small disobedience. I opened my eyes. I expected my darkness. There was a slant of something like moon. I reached out and my fingers passed through my own shadow. It is nothing, I thought, which is not true. But you can live quite a long time on things that are not true, if the city loves you and you love it back. I folded my hand. I put it on my ribs. I felt the thump. For now. For now, I thought, for now, for now, as if repeating it would make it less of a promise you cannot keep.",

                              "content": "In the morning the Br\u00e8che pretended to be ordinary, which was one of its best tricks. A bell rang that was not a bell but the shared intake of breath of a hundred doorframes. Light patted the walls like a host making sure the furniture had not moved in the night. I lay on my shelf and listened to wood remember it had been a tree and to stone remember it had been a river and to my own ribs remember they had once not needed names. Sleep had not come, but I had kept it company from nearby; that counts, I am told. When I sat up, the dictionary slid and sighed under my hand with the polite dismay of a book that had not expected to be useful so soon. My names were still there. I checked them with the anxious efficiency of someone who has already lost something once that morning and refuses to say it out loud.\n\nA girl who had slept two doors down blinked at me with the guileless stare of someone who had not yet picked an age and was trying on several. Her hair was the color of worn coins, and her hands were too big in a way that suggested intention rather than error, as if they were practicing for a version of her future where she would hold more than seemed decent. \u201cAre you new?\u201d she asked, and then made a face, because everyone here was new, always, each hallway pretending to be another and winning.\n\n\u201cI am chapter two,\u201d I said, unhelpfully, because that is what the morning felt like. She laughed in the way of a child who has learned that laughter is a form of currency and spends it when she doesn\u2019t want to answer a question. \u201cI\u2019m called Lorette,\u201d I added, because civility keeps you from slipping too quickly, and gave her a name from the outside of Henri\u2019s wallet.\n\nShe rolled my name in her mouth as if testing a pebble for smoothness. \u201cThey called me Estelle,\u201d she said, with the same sideways emphasis. \u201cI\u2019m practicing. My mother wanted to call me Stone. She had a sense of humor.\u201d She held up one oversized palm, and the lines down it were thick as ropes. The smell of chalk dust and rain came off her, as if she had slept under a staircase.\n\n\u201cWe should go where the bell wants,\u201d I said, and we went, because that is also a trick: walking when something calls you without asking how it knows your address.\n\nThe refectory pretended to be a kitchen inside a train station that had never had trains, which I liked very much. The tables were long and narrow and had scratches that made constellations if you tipped your head. The food was what you expect from a school that interrogates thresholds: slices of bread with the crusts on and off simultaneously; honey that refused to drip until someone told a truth; tea that tasted like weather. I sipped the weather and felt last night\u2019s rain kiss me again and then pull back in embarrassment. A boy with eyelashes like small broom bristles and a bruise of ink on his thumb swore at his cup under his breath in a language that involved a great deal of air. \u201cIf it will not pour, you must name it,\u201d a woman said kindly as she set down a plate that might have contained pears and might have contained the memory of pears. \u201cThe tea, not your anger. Anger hates being named before breakfast.\u201d She smiled, and I did not trust her at all because her smile had the seamed precision of upholstery. \u201cI am Madame Panse,\u201d she added. \u201cI will feed you. I will never feed you twice the same thing. You will forgive this or you will not; it will not change my menu.\u201d\n\nThere was a lecture in a stairwell because sometimes steps teach you better than chairs. We sat and stood and leaned and pretended the handrail was not a serpent. The Ma\u00eetresse d\u2019Entr\u00e9e looked precisely the way she had the night before, which for once reassured me; change is easier when you can point at what did not. She spoke without raising her voice, and yet her words did not lose their edges in the treads. \u201cYou will learn to cross,\u201d she said, as if stating arithmetic. \u201cNot because it is noble, but because it is necessary. I will not flatter you with destiny; we have none to sell. There are other schools where they bind you with prophecy and then charge tuition for the rope. We do work. Sometimes you will like it. Sometimes it will like you. I recommend you not count on either.\u201d\n\nShe had us hold out our hands. \u201cLeft,\u201d she said, and a few of the children made the wrong choice because children do. Her gaze did not soften; she repeated herself until each left hand sat cupped like an offering. \u201cThis is where you keep what you can\u2019t leave. You will find it fills quickly. Do not confuse what you cannot leave with what you ought not take. There are differences. Sometimes they are not big. You will learn to tell them with your eyes closed.\u201d\n\nShe passed between us and laid on each palm a weight you could not see. It made my bones ring. Estelle hissed and then hid her hiss behind her teeth as if embarrassed by its sincerity. The boy with the ink bruise swallowed and then swallowed again, and I watched the swallow push down his throat like a coin in a vending machine. When the Ma\u00eetresse reached me, her fingers touched the place where my lifeline used to be before it ran away into other people\u2019s stories. The weight she put there recognized me, like a scent you know from a past where you had a different voice. It wasn\u2019t grief, though it knew grief\u2019s shoes. It wasn\u2019t obligation, though it had obligation\u2019s posture. It was perhaps the habit of being a hinge. It sat and waited to be turned.\n\n\u201cIn your right,\u201d she said after a heartbeat, \u201cyou will keep what can be given.\u201d She smiled then at one of the doors that had chosen to be a door today. \u201cYou will run out faster. This is ordinary. Do not dramatize it. You are not starving because you cannot give something up; you are starving because you keep trying to feed your debts caramel.\u201d\n\nShe made us walk. Not far. The first lesson was to take a step without carrying the room with you. I found I had always failed at this; I was constantly dragging lint and eye-corners and breath-echoes behind me. \u201cYou are not a net,\u201d she said when she saw me watch my own trail, and then relented and added, \u201cYou are a hinge. The door is the net.\u201d The word hinge lived in her mouth as if she thought it unromantic, which I appreciated like a glass of water with no flowers in it.\n\nAfter the stairwell, there was a class in a hallway where each doorknob had a different temperature and several of them had opinions. A man who introduced himself as M. Chemin wrote a figure-eight on the air with a piece of chalk and then opened its middle like a purse. \u201cThis is the school\u2019s map,\u201d he said, simply, and that seemed honest. The emblem from my letter flickered in the loop. He pinched the break in the eight very gently. \u201cYou do not mend a crack by forgetting it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou do not leave it screaming, either. You stitch. You expect tenderness from neither thread nor skin. Those of you who have only ever been threads will find this frustrating. Those of you who have only ever been skin will find it unfair. Good. Fairness is a myth we invented to hide debt.\u201d\n\nHe saw how I watched, and he nodded at me as if to say yes, you were invited for a reason you will not like. Estelle\u2019s hand crept into mine with the speed of hail. I did not pull away. \u201cWe are going to the city today,\u201d M. Chemin added, casual in the manner of doctors announcing minor surgeries. \u201cPairs of two and threes. You will find a threshold and you will ask for its name, and when it asks for your price, you will pay with something you did not bring. If you cannot pay, you will borrow carefully. If you cannot borrow carefully, you will return and apologize. There is no shame in apologies, only hunger.\u201d\n\nAt the word city my heart did what birds do when a slate roof is lifted in the morning. The Br\u00e8che was not not in Paris, but it was a kind of parallel sentence; it had meaning in common with the city but not all its verbs. The thought of the street shook me like a bell. I saw Val\u00e9rian\u2019s hands on the inside of my eyelids, sorting small screws with the reverence some men reserve for prayers and others for pockets; I smelled the glue on Henri\u2019s fingers, which always made me think of fathers even though I had never had one and had borrowed the idea from a child who had cried at his bookstall one afternoon all spring; I heard the river make its worst argument.\n\nThe ash-sister walked through us as if we were smoke and sat in the first row with the poise of a queen who had no kingdom and no need of one. She wore a dress the color of unripe plums and a coat that would not admit to being seen by anyone born. \u201cYou will not be subtle,\u201d she said lightly, as if complimenting us. \u201cYou are all too new to be elegant. That is fine. Never mistake hiddenness for finesse. Nine out of ten locks prefer a bold key that admits its teeth.\u201d Her gaze fell on me with the polite weight of a boot on a moth. \u201cHinge,\u201d she said, and made it sound like both a profession and an insult. \u201cWho taught you to keep your laughter on a leash?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one did,\u201d I said before my caution could sit me down. \u201cIt learned.\u201d\n\n\u201cLaughter does not learn,\u201d she murmured. \u201cIt breeds. Keep it from the right-hand pocket unless you are making change.\u201d She lifted a paper-wrapped packet from a pocket I could not see. \u201cHomework,\u201d she said, and handed us each a scrap of folded something that did not feel like paper. Mine was cool and soft, like skin that had forgotten about bodies. \u201cReturn these with a threshold\u2019s true name wrapped inside. If it smells of your own hands when you hand it back, you have failed. If it smells of iron when wet, you have misunderstood the lesson. If it smells of sugar, we will send you to Lyon, where they make sweets of unsaid things and choke on them. If it smells like not-quite-rain, I will know you paid.\u201d\n\nEstelle and I and the boy of eyelashes were sent as a three. He told us his name as if confessing a crime. \u201cI am Dryden,\u201d he said, and offered two letters like a spare key. \u201cNot from here. From the reservoir between here and there. It is worse in summer.\u201d His eyelashes trembled as if on their own schedule. When he held the folded scrap to his mouth it darkened a shade, then paled again, as if practicing.\n\nThe Br\u00e8che released us into a courtyard that was not on any map and yet found its own way to a street I recognized. We pressed between the second and third ribs of a wrought iron gate, and there was Rue de Lille, minding its own lies. The sky had the hard brightness of a mirror when you do not want to see yourself. People flowed. Cars paused the way cats do when they realize they have been witnessed doing anything earnest. The museum wore its clocks with continental indifference. Paris smelled like rain and cigarettes and the ghost left by someone who had eaten an orange nearby two hours ago and then thought better of winter.\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d Estelle whispered, and I almost laughed because the question was infinite and the city does not like to be narrowed by whispering. \u201cWhere is a threshold?\u201d she amended, correcting herself, as all good students do, and Dryden pointed at everything. Doorsteps. The lip of the curb. The edge of a puddle where water pretended to be deeper than it had any right. The border where caf\u00e9 light stops because shadows said please. The seam in a wall where plaster had cracked and a spider had signed its name right over the wound.\n\nWe tried the caf\u00e9, not because it was easy but because difficulty often sits under striped awnings and pretends to be expensive. The door had a bell with a ring that sounded like the last coin in a pocket. I hovered an inch from its hinges and whispered, \u201cWhat name do you answer to when nobody is looking?\u201d The door considered. It considered so long that Dryden began to hum, as if to keep time from taking offense. Estelle laid her big hand on the wood, left fingers splayed, right like an apology. The door laughed. It was not unkind, but it was a laugh for a different joke. \u201cYou ask like a window,\u201d it said, and the ash-sister would have been pleased by the precision. \u201cCome back when you have learned boredom.\u201d We backed away, chastened and a little grateful. Doors that answer too readily are usually either generous or hungry, and both charge interest.\n\nOn Rue Jacob a woman with a braid like a rope of pretenses sat on a step crying in that tidy way of women who do not intend to inconvenience anyone and therefore produce the most inconvenient sadness. Her handbag hurt my eyes. It had cost a promise. The step under her held three centuries of feet and wine and fatigue. It was low and strong and had lichen in the corner like unspoken interruptions. I bent so close my breath fogged the thin strip of shadow where the riser met the tread. \u201cHow do you call yourself,\u201d I breathed, \u201cwhen nobody is looking at you and everybody walks on you for years and then they repaint you and pretend you are new?\u201d The step exhaled. \u201cI am called Not Worth It,\u201d it said, and the bitterness was old and deserved. \u201cBut when the house is listening, I am called Come Home.\u201d\n\nEstelle\u2019s eyes widened. Dryden eased his folded scrap open. It looked like a tongue and a blindfold at once. I laid it on the step and held it there with the bare skin of my palm. The step stirred. It asked the question all thresholds know to ask: \u201cWhat do you pay?\u201d Estelle reached for her pocket. Dryden reached for his own name. I remembered the square of cloth the Ma\u00eetresse had given me and felt the slyness move in my wrist. The step would not be cheated. But sometimes you are allowed to confuse it gently.\n\nI held the square, nothing in it, everything of it, and I thought of my laugh that came back wrong and of the smell of lilacs that had almost burned and of the river failing to pretend it wasn\u2019t greedy. I had very little worth paying that wasn\u2019t a lie. So I paid time. A sliver. Not the time I would miss; the time that knits yourself to a place when you let your breath match a stranger\u2019s breath for one beat and then tell yourself you haven\u2019t. It is an unethical coin, and I would not recommend using it. The step shivered. It took it. A cold skittered along my left hand, and my dead moved over to make room for yet another thing I would have to remember.\n\nThe folded scrap drank the name. It became damp with it in the way paper gets damp when it knows a secret that does not belong to it. Dryden wrinkled his nose at the smell. Not sugar. Not iron. Something like rain that had changed its mind halfway down. \u201cEnough,\u201d the step said, dignified as a gentleman who has been offered poor tea and accepts it for the sake of conversation. The woman with the braid blew her nose and stood up straighter without knowing why. Her handbag frowned. Estelle stroked the edge of the tread with the side of her thumb, the way you comfort a dog. We left because we could.\n\nWe moved like people who had earned something and were suspicious of it. Thresholds find this alluring. They opened themselves all down the street with the casual indecency of cabaret dancers. We pretended not to notice. Dryden sang under his breath a song about water pretending to be patient. We should not have been surprised when we met hunger.\n\nAt the corner of Rue des Saints-P\u00e8res and a street that preferred not to tell me its name, the world snagged. A revolving door spun too fast and then not fast enough, and a girl flung her palms against its glass and miscounted her own fingers. It was such a small mistake; it is always the small ones. The door peeled her shadow off like tape. She shrieked in the way of a creature being turned into a vocabulary she did not speak. Her mother said the wrong thing and then the right thing in the wrong order. The door grinned. A man inside it thrust forward with a bouquet that had been expensive and now looked like bad news. The ash-sister stepped out from the shadow of a delivery truck, and the streetlight bent, and the river laughed three blocks away because it laughs at anything that moves.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said before my thinking could explain to the rest of me that I had no tools. The ash-sister\u2019s head tilted not to me but to the city, like she was listening through the asphalt for a subway that would pass in an hour. \u201cIt is owed,\u201d she said softly, not kind, not unkind. Her eyes met mine and held, and I felt the emblem under my dress press its broken loop into my skin as if the thorn would prefer to be a needle.\n\nI threw my square of cloth at her. It was the stupidest possible thing, and I did it because I am a hinge and hinges sometimes snap with grace. She caught it reflexively. Her fingers closed. The cloth behaved, which was to say it pretended to be nothing and then it was. The ash-sister\u2019s mouth made a shape like annoyance and then like approval and then like hunger again. Estelle pushed her hand between the door and the frame and let the door take the dead skin at the side of her thumb as tax. Dryden put his forehead on the glass and called it the wrong name and then the right one and then laughed in the way the ash-sister had warned me not to use, and the door hiccuped and stuttered and then, like all machines with too many eyes on them, decided it wanted to be moderate.\n\nThe girl stumbled, sobbing, into her mother\u2019s lap. They both looked at the bouquet as if it had done all of this by itself. The man pressed a lily at the door for luck and left the city\u2019s grief on the glass where someone else would shoulder it later. The ash-sister folded my nothing square and tucked it in her sleeve as if it had always belonged there. \u201cI will return it with interest,\u201d she said, and I believed her, which is the kind of mistake you think is strength.\n\nWe collected ourselves. Estelle sucked at the blood on her thumb with just anger. Dryden squeezed his folded scrap and grimaced at the smell, which had gone from almost-rain to the sound of a coin dropped in a fountain after the wish was already spent. We walked until our feet forgave us for trying to be brave. M. Chemin had told us not to be subtle, and we had obeyed, and the city had noticed, which it did not mind. It minds being ignored more than anything. It took our attention and turned it into work, as cities do.\n\nI veered toward Rue Dauphine without telling the others and without telling myself I was disobeying any instruction. The clock shop was open because it didn\u2019t close. It never closed. Time had no manners. The bell on the door made three different sounds. Val\u00e9rian looked up with a face that let its hope be seen and then pretended it had not. \u201cMon \u00e9cho,\u201d he said, and the freckle at 4:08 near his mouth made its case for permanence.\n\n\u201cI brought you nothing,\u201d I said, because sometimes accuracy is clearest when it sounds like a joke. Estelle hung back with the respect of a child who has walked into a chapel by accident and is trying to behave in case God is present and bored. Dryden pretended to read a clock made from a pheasant\u2019s spine.\n\n\u201cYou never bring me nothing,\u201d Val\u00e9rian said, and the sentence had two meanings and both were true. He saw my folded scrap and my names and the thinness of my left hand. \u201cIt has started, then,\u201d he added, voice mild, as if discussing the weather, which was precisely the kind of thing he would do to avoid admitting he was frightened on my behalf.\n\n\u201cIt smells of a step,\u201d I said, and handed him the homework because my hands were shaking and I did not want to drop obligation on the floor. \u201cIt asked for time,\u201d I admitted, and he sighed without opening his mouth because he used his sighs carefully and did not waste them on air that did not deserve them. He poured tea into the thimble he had kept for me. It tasted like re-labeled rain. \u201cYou have blood on your thumb,\u201d he told Estelle, who flushed with pride as if she had been publicly praised for competence. \u201cAnd iron under your tongue,\u201d he told Dryden, who looked offended and then amused, which is better for a boy who has lived near reservoirs.\n\nI did not say I had thrown the cloth at the ash-sister. Val\u00e9rian looked at me anyway like a clock that has decided to be honest about its minutes. \u201cYou threw the wrong thing,\u201d he said gently. \u201cBut wrong things sometimes get to the right place.\u201d He put a little screw on the counter and the screw cast a shadow that looked like a bird. \u201cThere is a current,\u201d he said to the room, not to me, or to me but at a distance so I could pretend not to hear if I needed to. \u201cThe Br\u00e8che is not the only school that has rediscovered appetite. Be careful with teachers who cannot distinguish between teaching and feeding. Those are old verbs; they dress alike at night.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you miss me?\u201d I said; I had not meant to; the question was an itch I scratched in public. He made a face as if someone had poured sugar in his tea and he wanted to be grateful and could not. \u201cI miss you in the way a clock misses being wound,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does not want the hand. It does not want the pressure. It wants the purpose and then calls the pressure purpose to be polite. Go do your work. Come back when you can. If the Br\u00e8che moves, I will find it by tapping the bones in my ankle that still want to be gears.\u201d\n\nEstelle touched a stack of faces without glass and shivered. Dryden coerced a cuckoo into revealing how it felt about its job. The answer was obscene and scholarly. We left with less than we had brought and more than we intended, which is a sign of success in any errand worth doing.\n\nWhen we returned to the Br\u00e8che, M. Chemin caught our packets not with his hands but with the habit of having been handed things. He sniffed and smiled with one side of his mouth. \u201cCome Home,\u201d he read under his breath, and the words softened him like wetness softens bread. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, and to Dryden he said, \u201cWe will fix your habit of paying with iron; you are not a gate,\u201d and to Estelle he said, \u201cDo not be brave with flesh if you can be brave with pride; pride bleeds slower.\u201d He looked at me last and long. \u201cYou gave something you did not have to give,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not mistake generosity for payment. You will be poor if you cannot tell the difference.\u201d\n\nThe ash-sister stood at his shoulder and did not look at me, which was a performance, and I admired its form. She smelled of lavender that had been warned. \u201cYou have my nothing,\u201d I told her, because I knew better and because knowledge had never stopped me. \u201cKeep it until you need to forget something and then give it back and call us even.\u201d She finally deigned to smile directly at me, a flash of teeth that told me nothing and promised less. \u201cFair,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd impossible.\u201d She turned away with the economy of someone whose movements are measured by a metronome other people cannot hear.\n\nEvening in the Br\u00e8che was when the building scattered itself and then reconvened, like a family that has learned how to part without making it mournful. The library of doors took a deep breath. The refectory adjusted its chairs so that enemies would sit with their backs together and call it compromise. A window practiced fogging and not fogging and chose fog. I lay on my shelf and pretended to sleep because I had been taught the importance of playacting, and because the lesson moved best if you made space for it. From the hallway came the sound of someone reciting multiplication tables and crying as if numbers were the offense they had always secretly suspected, and from somewhere below came the thin, persistent singing of pipes that had learned to be chimneys and had not forgotten their first love.\n\nI held the square the Ma\u00eetresse had given me earlier, not the one I had thrown; it still smelled like an attic and a fruit I could not name. I held it and tried to think of what I would refuse to give if asked properly and paid the right compliments. The list was shorter than it should have been. Perhaps that was goodness; perhaps that was poverty. I put my dead on the left and my names on the right and told myself jokes about weather that would be funny to no one in this building. The joke still kept its shape in my mouth. That was a kind of luck.\n\nAt some hour that was between the hours the Br\u00e8che recognizes, there was a noise that made my knuckles ache. It was not a bell. It was a practice. Students rose wherever they had fallen asleep and made faces at one another to disguise their fear. \u201cFieldwork,\u201d someone said. \u201cMidnight,\u201d someone else said. \u201cSea,\u201d another voice said, and I closed my eyes because the Ma\u00eetresse had told me to when it came to the sea and because I had disobeyed her once already today and that seemed enough even for me. I did not look. I did not listen. I counted to four. At four I remembered the light from the ambulance that time that wasn\u2019t mine but which I always found in the blue of shutters. At seven I remembered lilacs and ash. At nine I remembered the thin white seal and felt it press between my ribs like a nail you swallow to show off and then regret even before it hurts.\n\nThe Br\u00e8che moved. It does it with the courtesy of a cat deciding to forgive you for nothing. The timbers told the stone their favorite word and the stone whispered it to the windows and the windows put it in their mouths and passed it on. We slid. The smell of salt arrived through the vents like a rumor that had paid for passage. Estelle\u2019s hand found mine in the dark and stayed there in the brazen way of a child who has not been taught to ask and therefore knows how to take what she needs. Dryden sang under his breath a line about not drowning if nobody learns your name for it. Above us, or below, or inside, a woman laughed, and it was a good laugh, the kind that suggests kindness rather than triumph.\n\nThe Ma\u00eetresse\u2019s voice spoke from the place where walls meet ceiling and forget whose job it is to bear the weight. \u201cKeep your lefts,\u201d she said. \u201cUse your rights. Do not pay with what you will miss in the morning. If you see yourself, do not say hello. She does not want to meet you, and you will not like her greeting. If you are asked a question and you cannot tell whether it deserves an answer, put a name in your mouth and do not speak it. The shape will hold you.\u201d\n\nI held a name like a lozenge. I chose L\u2019Or\u00e9e, which is our word for the edge of a forest and also for the place where stories start. It tasted like sap and cheap wine and a kiss under a bridge that did not happen and did not forget to charge my heart for its absence. The building sighed. The sea put its shoulder against our door. The night admired itself in the glass and the glass pretended not to notice. I thought of the step on Rue Jacob and its two names, and I thought of the ash-sister, noun and verb, and I thought of Val\u00e9rian\u2019s ankles and the way love makes you want to live inside someone\u2019s sleeve and then calls it something else so you can be proud of yourself while you hide.\n\nMorning would come again. It always does, even in schools that keep different clocks. I would learn to turn without breaking. They had promised that and had not promised to be kind. I was built for that sort of oath. On my left, the dead rustled politely, making room for what I would collect and forget to lay down. On my right, my names slept like cats, ignoring me with their faces while pinning my legs with their weight. Paris breathed beyond the walls like a creature that would not admit to being a creature. The river did not apologize for wanting. The school did not apologize for teaching. The ash-sister did not apologize for anything. I slept, finally, and woke twice without realizing it either time, and when I woke a third time there was a shell on my pillow where no one had put a shell, and inside it I could hear someone counting, and the numbers were wrong in a way that made me feel almost safe.",

                              "content": "The shell was the size of a thumbnail and shaped like a question that had learned to sleep on its side. When I lifted it, it made the faint crackle of paper that has been folded too long and forgotten in a pocket woven for a smaller coat. Inside, someone counted stubbornly, a string of numbers with their buttons misbuttoned, marching with the brave incompetence of a parade that did not know which end of the street was the start. I held it to my left ear because the left knows what to do with debt, and the numbers made sense in a way that did not correspond to the calendar. Estelle appeared in the doorway and blinked at the sight of me listening to a shell that had no business having found me, and her face smoothed into relief at the strangeness because ordinary mornings are the enemy of places like this. \u201cDoes it say your name?\u201d she asked, and I almost lied and said yes just to see what would look back at her out of her own certainty, but the shell\u2019s whisper was not a name; it was a tide. Dryden hovered behind her, eyelashes fretting, and leaned forward until the shell took his breath and made a ledger of it. He shuddered and said, with the outrage of a boy whose reservoirs had been insulted, that the counting was wrong on purpose.\n\nThe Ma\u00eetresse d\u2019Entr\u00e9e rang no bell and yet the building obeyed the idea of one, loosening its corners and then pulling them tight. In the stairwell that taught better than chairs, she told us that the Br\u00e8che had nosed against water in the night and intended to use what it found. She did not say sea as if it were an invitation; she said it like a boundary that would pretend to be a friend long enough to make you polite. \u201cYou will keep your lefts,\u201d she said, and made us hold our hands up until we could tell the difference without peeking, \u201cand you will learn the arithmetic of edges that do not stay where they are put. The shell is a summons, not a souvenir. You will treat it with the respect you reserve for doors that laugh at you.\u201d The ash-sister leaned on a banister two steps above us as if she had grown there, her coat doing its refusal to be witnessed, and she smiled with the thoughtless patience of a knife that assumes bread will continue to present itself. A man with hair the color of salt-spray and a face that had been carved by a chisel that liked to work slowly introduced himself as Ma\u00eetre Sel, and I believed him because his mouth was the mouth of someone who swallowed thirst for a living. He told us that the sea asks for price in currencies we mistake for generosity. \u201cYou pay with thirst,\u201d he said pleasantly. \u201cYou pay with direction. If you pay with pride, you will walk in circles until your bones forgive you.\u201d\n\nWe were given lengths of dried kelp braided with twine that had once tied up packages of undelivered letters, and we were told to wear them like ridiculous necklaces. Madame Panse handed us cups of something that tasted exactly like low tide at noon in a year you did not like, and when several of the children made the faces people make when encountering truth in broth, she clucked and told them that offense is an appetite with better manners. Dryden pressed his palm to the shell and said he could hear a reservoir emptying backward so that the surface remembered what it had never known, and Estelle confessed in a voice large enough to fill her own hands that boats made her nonsensically angry. I tucked the shell behind Henri\u2019s stitched wallet, in the soft of my dress, where the left side could keep watch. It warmed there, and the counting grew fainter, as if the numbers had found a thumb to hold.\n\nThe door to the water was a rope ladder and a circle of glass at once, a porthole that had stopped pretending because it had nothing to gain. The Ma\u00eetresse\u2019s finger drew a figure-eight in the air and broke it gently, making space, and M. Chemin\u2019s map-that-wasn\u2019t slid its loop over our heads like a collar that fit everyone poorly but well enough. When we stepped through, the floor forgot us for a second, and then stones took an interest. The morning outside the Br\u00e8che was not Paris morning; it was a color that cities can only imagine. Grey in the way that remembers blue personally, with salt on it like a rumor someone swore was true. We stood on a wooden pier that had learned to sigh properly, the boards groaning like knees that had carried love around for decades. On one side the school pressed its shoulder against a building that thought it was a boathouse in a town that does not exist, and on the other the sea counted without counting, a long subtraction across a page too big for our sums. The air tasted of iron things that had been asked to be faithful.\n\n\u201cRetrieve a name the tide stole and is tired of carrying,\u201d said the ash-sister, distributing instruction like cards she had already decided would not favor us. \u201cReturn a ring that refuses rust and therefore refuses to tell the truth. Speak to the drowned gate that lets boats pretend their choices are their own. If you are offered a song, pay attention to the verse where the singer runs out of breath. That is the price.\u201d She looked at me last and added, almost idly, \u201cDo not be elegant.\u201d It sounded like an insult and a caress, and I hated how much I appreciated the balance of it.\n\nWe went with Dryden again because water prefers the familiar and had already put the outline of him in its pocket. Estelle carried the feeling of a dockworker badly hidden under a schoolgirl\u2019s bravery, and I brought my usual collection of reluctances. An older student named Maud came with us as a chaperone nobody wanted; she had hair the color of wet rope and eyes that had been narrowed by having to recognize too many kinds of fog. We walked a seam of stones slick with a language I did not speak. Barnacles made their blunt arguments at our ankles, and ropes slept in heavy coils that dreamed of throats and would deny it in daylight. Above us a gull made a noise that would have been obscene if it had been said in a room. We found footprints on the weathered planks that stepped into water and did not step out and then reappeared three boards later as if someone had been returned from the middle of a sentence. I shivered and felt the shell answer, a little more urgently wrong than before.\n\nTo ask the sea to open a door, you must use a word that was not made with hands. The ash-sister says this sort of thing as if she invented it and the sea had taken notes. Dryden put his face to the split between the boards and exhaled, and the water rose to meet his breath with the politeness of a host that intends the party to last until morning. \u201cPrice,\u201d it hissed with the sand in its voice, and the word rubbed my ears raw. Estelle offered pride immediately, because she is built like a door and wanted the test, and Maud bared her throat in that way certain women do when they are not demonstrating courage but reminding fear that they have paid rent. I put my hand in my pocket and felt the square of cloth the Ma\u00eetresse had given me the first night, and I held it as instructed and thought very loudly about being poor in the correct direction.\n\nThe water did not want breath; it had enough. It did not want iron; it could make its own counterfeit. It wanted something that would make the hinge turn easier when we were not looking. It wanted a morning. Not a particular date with a particular egg at a particular caf\u00e9. It wanted the sort of morning that accumulates behind your bones because you have been kind to a stranger and then forgotten the kindness on purpose. I was angry at that. I have so few of those, and they are small and untidy. But anger is salt with bad manners; it dries you without preserving anything. I thought of a day half a city away when I had hovered above Rue du Bac and watched a woman stoop to tie a child\u2019s shoe as if she were learning prayer in a new religion, and I thought of not letting that memory live with me anymore. The sea sniffed the thought and took it straight from my left hand, where my dead made room and were offended on my behalf. The deck quivered under our feet and parted like lips. We went down in a sway that matched the count inside the shell, except for the places where it did not.\n\nThe drowned gate lay three ribbed lengths out, where pilings lifted their skirts to show the barnacles and did not blush. It looked like a door to nothing, hanging on its hinge by obstinacy and rumor, and I loved it immediately because it refused function but would never admit it. A ring of metal glowed around one of the posts, unoxidized and smug, a wedding band that had married itself and the idea of being undecayed. I pricked the wood with Val\u00e9rian\u2019s pin where a hinge would have been if the gate had remembered its profession today. The wood bled, thin and bitter, and the water laughed in that old way that makes people grow superstitions like mold. \u201cElsewhere,\u201d I said, and Estelle nodded and put her hand on the untruthful ring as if it were a throat she was fond of. Dryden hummed until the metal remembered wanting to be coin, and the ring let go without pride. Maud wrapped it in a square of what looked like waxed cloth and smelled like a promise made in shallow water. \u201cThe name,\u201d she reminded, and we pressed our hands against the gate and asked the question doors are always practicing answers for.\n\nIt told us one of its names without being coy. The drowned do not always play at riddles; they tire of it faster than the rest of us, and the sea is very tired. \u201cI am Shut Because You Thought You Could Not,\u201d it said, and the words went into my wrist bones and settled there like grit. We slid the ash-sister\u2019s folded packet under the latch where a latch would be, and the word sank into the material like a bruise behaving itself. The packet smelled, when I lifted it to my nose, of a storm deciding it could wait. Dryden\u2019s face softened with the relief of work accomplished, and Estelle\u2019s hands flexed as if they were reading a future written on rope.\n\nHunger arrived with the politeness it uses when it wants a tip. A child stood on the steps of stone where the pier met the shore, where algae drew a green horizon an inch above our ankles. She had the look of someone who had been told to wait and had been good about it. The sea had made a ring around her as if to keep dogs off. The ash-sister watched from a shadow that women know before they know their own names. I went toward the child because I am not wise and because hinges prefer doors that try to shut while you are walking through them. \u201cYour hands are wrong,\u201d the child said in a mild voice, and I loved her for the accuracy. \u201cI\u2019m owed,\u201d she added, and the water lifted as if it wanted to see who would go to the trouble of arguing.\n\nI have never liked the way the ash-sister says the word owed. It is too clean in her mouth. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d I said to the child, kneeling so my eyes were level with terror\u2019s eyebrows, \u201cbut perhaps the bookkeeper took lunch.\u201d It was a weak joke, but weak jokes have a certain magic when used properly; you can slip a small truth under their hem while nobody is watching. The ash-sister came a step closer, and the square I had thrown at her yesterday pulsed faintly like a heartbeat under her sleeve. \u201cDo not borrow where you cannot be found to repay,\u201d she murmured, and I showed her my empty right hand and my very full left and dared her to call me a liar.\n\nThe sea asked price without moving its mouth. The shell in my dress stiffened and the counting stumbled on seven and grinned about it. I held the Ma\u00eetresse\u2019s nothing-cloth and let it be what it was. I thought of laughter, tethered and too well-trained. I thought of giving that up and felt my edges complain in a pitch only I could hear. I thought of the thing I have that is least useful and most me. Cats have not seen me since the letter arrived. It had begun as insult and become habit. I could give that. You would laugh if you knew how it hurt. I said to the water, which always prefers the particular, that I would not ask a cat to see me again until I had finished a piece of work I did not yet know the size of. The sea made a sound like someone swallowing an oath, and the ring around the child loosened as if embarrassed to have been seen in public doing anything earnest. Estelle lifted her by the armpits in the way of someone who has hauled sacks of flour with love, and Dryden stood between the water and the air at her back in case a noun decided to change its mind. The ash-sister watched us do all this with a face like embroidery that resented the needle. \u201cDeferred,\u201d she said when the child\u2019s mother ran up with a cry that could have stopped clocks if clocks believed in mercy. \u201cThat debt does not vanish. You have purchased later. Later is an expensive thing to love.\u201d\n\nThe shell thrummed as if approving a line in a song that it did not expect to like. I put it to Estelle\u2019s ear and she flinched and then smiled the slow smile of someone trying on a coat that fits better than the one she was told to love. \u201cTwo,\u201d she said, and said it again, and then the number lost its arithmetic and became a shape that matched the span of her hands. Dryden held the shell and went very still in the way of people who do not enjoy gifts. \u201cHold,\u201d he said, and then coughed, as if the taste of the word on his tongue had changed the water in his mouth. The shell warmed once and then cooled as if it remembered itself too late.\n\nWe walked back as if the pier were a sentence we were unwilling to finish. Maud taught us to swear in a dialect of storms that nobody writes down anymore because the paper cannot float after, and she told us that the ring would try to lie about what it had seen, which is the habit of all things that think rust is an insult and not a kind of loyalty. The Br\u00e8che took us in without ceremony. M. Chemin collected our packets with the absent competence of a man who has learned to map the parts of speech that refuse to sit through lessons. He sniffed ours and nodded and said \u201cShut Because You Thought You Could Not\u201d under his breath like a recipe. The ash-sister returned my cloth folded twice into smaller and said nothing about interest, which worried me more than an invoice would have. Her sleeve smelled of smoke and weather.\n\nThat evening I went to the library of doors because the smell of kelp had gotten into the seams of my attention and I needed the dry logic of wood to scrape it off. The shelf where I slept had a new inscription in a language I could read if I practiced kindness to it: Later. It was not an invitation. It was an opinion. I ran my knuckle lightly along the grain and heard a sound under my finger like a throat refusing an apology. The figure-eight on the air hovered in a memory I had not had time to make, and the thorn that mended it pricked through as if the emblem on my letter wanted to be sure I had not mistaken it for anything else. I tried to turn, the way a hinge does when nobody is looking at it and it wants to be good, and the door did not. Later, it repeated, and behind the refusal I smelled a house I had not lived in where the windows are always almost open.\n\nThe shell had fallen asleep in my pocket and then woken without my permission. I took it out and set it on my pillow next to my dictionary of sighs, and the two looked at each other like elderly neighbors who suspect the other of borrowing sugar and never washing the cup before returning it. Numbers spilled out again, all the wrong shapes, curls where there should be angles, angles where there should be curves, and I put my palm over the shell to make the voice say please. It did not. I thought of Val\u00e9rian and the small freckle that sat at 4:08 near his mouth and wondered what time his ankle bones claimed for themselves when he stood at his bench and let the weight of him be part of his work. I felt foolish for missing a man who was mostly clocks. The feeling did not diminish because I told it to.\n\nIn the middle of the night, the building flexed its shoulders the way it does when it intends to slip past a refusal. A moth knocked once against the underside of the shelf and then was not a moth. Paper slid toward me as if the school had coughed and found a lost cough in its pocket. The seal was that thin white again, the starved color that pretends to be nothing and then shows you the bruise you left when you thought you were gentle. The figure-eight unclosed and stitched shut by a thorn hurt my eyes, and I licked the taste of lilac ash off my lip before it had time to make a claim. The letter smelled like rain that had been asked to wait. Inside, the hand I knew from the dream I couldn\u2019t remember had written my name as if it were a direction. It did not say you have been accepted; that had already been done to me. It said Tuition. It said Due. It said 4:08 in the corner with a dot of ink that freckled like a mouth opening and closing on a word it would not use in polite company. It said Bring what you cannot leave.\n\nThe morning pretended it had not heard. Madame Panse served bread that was not both crusted and not crusted but simply bread, and the tea tasted like having nothing to say to a friend you love and deciding to sit anyway. The Ma\u00eetresse d\u2019Entr\u00e9e spoke in the stairwell and did not mention the sea or the letter because the school does not argue with its own weather in public. Estelle held her cup in both hands and made a face when the heat bit her palms and then smiled as if being bitten were the correct thing to have done. Dryden found a coin in his pocket that he had not put there and returned it to the air, which is the only safe way to be honest in a building like this. I folded the letter along its crack where the figure-eight had broken and mended and tucked it against my ribs where the emblem could burn through if it needed to make its point.\n\nAt the end of the day, when classes had finished telling us things we already knew in words we had not yet earned, I went somewhere you will not put on a map. The Br\u00e8che keeps a room where people go to practice not promising. It is lined with mirrors that will not admit to being mirrors unless you are cruel to them, and the ash-sister likes to stand there and apply imaginary lipstick while telling you the price of watching yourself break and then not fixing it. I do not go there because I do not enjoy certain kinds of truth. I went instead to a hall where the floor forgot to be a floor every third board and remembered what it had been before wood. There is a window there that only looks out when you have done something you regret while telling yourself it was necessary. I held the shell against the glass and asked it if it had room for one more wrong number, and it said yes with the eagerness of a child who has not yet learned what yes costs.\n\nIt was later, both the word and the hour, when the city made itself heard through the pipes, the way a mother clears her throat when you misunderstand something she has said since you were small. The counting in the shell stopped at four and then refused to be anything else. I thought of 4:08 receding like a tide that had decided to be punctual for once, and the corners of my bones made that fault-line noise again that I was trying to learn to distinguish from danger. I did not sleep properly. I lay beside the dictionary and the shell and the letter, and I invented many ways to pretend that tuition could be paid with things I had already lost, and I admired my own inventiveness like a thief who marvels at the weight of what is not yet stolen.\n\nIn the morning, the ash-sister stood at the end of my shelf as if she were a portrait that refused to be hung where people could see it. \u201cYou received a bill,\u201d she said, not a question, and her smile was small and efficient like a blade that does not brag. \u201cI told you we do what is owed,\u201d she added, as if she were tired of being right, which I cannot imagine she ever is. I showed her my left hand and she nodded because it was heavy. I showed her my right and she shrugged because it never is, not for long. \u201cYou will be sent to the place in the city where numbers pretend to be mercy,\u201d she said. \u201cDo not mistake the line you stand in for the line you are crossing. Doors love that error, and they will keep it in sugar for you until you are old.\u201d\n\nI went looking for Val\u00e9rian not with my feet but with the part of me that has learned to travel by absence. The city breathed through the bricks in a rhythm that was not mine but that I could borrow if I was polite. When I pressed my face to the cold in the window between two bald lamplight patches, there was no clockshop where it should have been; there was a smear of afternoon where morning should have held itself and a smell of onion soup that felt like a mistake. I pulled back before the ache behind my eyes could make decisions for me. I told myself he was as permanent as the freckle at the corner of his mouth and that permanence is a silly word in my line of work. I folded my names and tucked one I had not used in years into my cheek the way you keep a coin for emergencies.\n\nIn class, M. Chemin drew the figure-eight again and opened its bruise so gently the chalk did not complain. \u201cWhat happens when you overpay,\u201d he asked the air, and the air, which had been to school before, did not volunteer. \u201cYou are changed before you arrive,\u201d he said, and looked at me as if the answer had my face. \u201cYou lose the habit of being one thing. Some of you should have never been one thing. This will suit you, until it doesn\u2019t.\u201d Madame Panse delivered pears that were pears and memories of pears, and even I, who do not eat, admired the elegance of the trick and the kindness of her pretending it was not a trick at all.\n\nI did not open the letter a second time because it would have been greedy. I held it like a vow. At four in the afternoon the Br\u00e8che\u2019s clocks, all of which disagree out of principle, agreed to arrive at eight for the minute it takes to be exact by accident. Something on my left hand moved to make room. Something on my right scratched and begged for work. I went to the place the ash-sister had not told me to go and found the line that people use when they are told that mercy can be exchanged for paper. It was the prefecture where permits are issued to souls who want to cross the city without losing their heart in neighborhoods where hearts are collected for sport. The line had a smell like winter coats hung too close together. A man in a blue scarf stood near the back and waved at a woman who pretended not to see him in order to see him better. I was a hinge. I made myself the right size and fit into a seam between a woman\u2019s hat and a man\u2019s impatience. I put the shell against the metal of a stanchion that had been touched too many times by people learning to wait. The counting inside it smiled and said 4:08 like a prayer and like an accusation. I looked for Val\u00e9rian because I am very poor at learning what the lesson is until I have paid for it and for the coat it came in.\n\nA moth landed on my wrist, and because I am incapable of respecting the economy of patterns, I fed it a crumb of lamplight that I had hoarded in my hair. It sat with the modesty of messengers who know they will be paid twice for being the sort of animal people forgive. It had no letter for me. That is a letter, too. I went back to the Br\u00e8che. The ash-sister did not say anything; she never needs to. The Ma\u00eetresse told us we would go to mirrors tomorrow with our eyes closed and that we would learn to open them only when we could say our names without thinking of our faces. Dryden muttered the word hold into his tea until it settled. Estelle measured her hands against the table\u2019s scars and smiled when her palm matched the constellation exactly. The shell on my pillow clicked once like a clock that had decided to be honest for a single minute, and in the tiny quiet after, before the school inhaled for its next trick, I knew that debts had many shapes and that one of them was a freckle that sometimes was a time.",

The stairwell where lessons took their best shape had been hung with frames that did not hold glass so much as they held their breath. We were told to walk with our eyes closed until the word, and the word would come from someone who did not own us. It was not a trick; it was worse and better. It was practice.\n\n\u201cNames first,\u201d the Ma\u00eetresse d\u2019Entr\u00e9e said, and her voice had the grain of a plank that has known the sea and gone on knowing floors after. \u201cFaces after. Faces lie in ways names cannot afford.\u201d Madame Panse stood at the landing with cups of something that smelled like steam warming its hands, and she gave one to anyone whose knees forgot what knees are for. The ash-sister leaned against a pillar that had watched surrender become fashion three times in this building\u2019s history, and she looked at our closed eyes with the affection of a winter window that knows which breath will fog it first.\n\nEstelle went ahead with the bravery of someone who has not yet learned to be suspicious of her own courage. \u201cEstelle,\u201d she said to the breathing frames, and the first mirror stiffened delicately, as if it had been asked to be honest at breakfast. \u201cAgain,\u201d said the Ma\u00eetresse, soft as thread. \u201cEstelle,\u201d Estelle said, and let the syllables widen until her hands could sit in them. The mirror did not give back a face. It gave her the shape of her name the way water shows you your height by remembering how you fall. Dryden followed, his lashes worrying the air, and when he said his name the mirror handed him a thirst and waited to see whether he would swallow it or let it stand on the rim of the cup and call itself weather.\n\nI did not want to go. I am very good at wanting not to go. But hinges do not get the luxury of sulking; we are built for doors that have no patience with hurt. I stood in front of a frame carved with vines that had never intended to fruit, and I closed my eyes so that if I stumbled I could pretend I had meant to. \u201cLorette,\u201d I said, and felt the way my names sit in my mouth, like cats who pretend they were not invited. The frame considered whether to pretend it had never met a hinge before. \u201cAgain,\u201d the Ma\u00eetresse murmured, and I had to decide how not to lie to myself in public. \u201cLorette,\u201d I said, and let the word crack where it needed to. The mirror breathed. It did not give me a face. It gave me a minute. 4:08, the taste of it on my tongue like iron rinsed three times to be polite. Blue light from an ambulance turning a man\u2019s hand into a flag of meat. A metro mouth that had not decided whether to spit or swallow. Lilacs that had been burned and snatched back from smoke at the last possible second by rain that had been raised to mind its manners.\n\n\u201cEyes,\u201d said the Ma\u00eetresse so quickly that the ash-sister did not have time to smile at my disobedience, and I opened them because I have learned which orders to obey as if I had invented them. The mirror did not hold my face. It held the back of my head, the tilt of my shoulders when I pretended to be taller than grief. It showed me the hinge of me, the place where I turned. Behind that the minute sat and refused to let the glass forget. The emblem on my letter, tucked where it could bruise me when I breathed too deeply, pressed its broken loop into my ribs as if to say you will not get out of this with metaphors.\n\n\u201cPayment,\u201d said the mirror in a voice I would have trusted if it had been a woman asking me to hold her bag while she fastened a child\u2019s coat. \u201cBring what you cannot leave.\u201d I had brought my left hand, full as always, and my right, which tried to be brave by being easy. The cloth the Ma\u00eetresse had given me sat soft as attic air between my fingers, and I held it as a decoy that did not insult the hunter. I could not pay laughter; it had already learned to return to other mouths without me. I could not pay the cats; that coin had rolled into the sea and purchased later. All that left me, once I had told the truth that made me wince, was the thing Val\u00e9rian called me when I had needed a name he could afford. Mon \u00e9cho. If I gave that, the mirror would be satisfied and I would have to learn how to want otherwise.\n\n\u201cI will give my echo,\u201d I said, and the ash-sister\u2019s head tilted like a knife that had heard its own nickname. The mirror looked pleased and pitiless; glass prefers exactness. \u201cLeft,\u201d said the Ma\u00eetresse from behind my shoulder, and I moved the weight into the correct palm so that my right could pretend to be generous without being stupid. I paid. The sound unlatched. It did not leave; it rerouted. I felt it go not out of my mouth but out of my bones, and the loss made a small professional hole in me, the way removing a gear will not stop a clock but will change how it refuses to tell the truth.\n\nThe glass warmed in the way of things that are proud of having gotten what they asked for without earning the right to be proud. It softened around the minute like fat around a scar. 4:08 shifted, not away, but deeper into the frame where I could not see it unless I chose to be cruel to myself. \u201cTuition,\u201d the mirror said, satisfied and administrative, and the letter under my dress cooled as if a tongue had licked its seal for luck. I stepped back and had to hold the railing because the part of me that loved Val\u00e9rian had never had to be brave about sound before.\n\nDryden watched me with that opaque offense of boys who suspect someone is better at losing than they are, and Estelle wrapped both her too-big hands around my wrist and squeezed until my attention stopped wandering. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d she asked, and the kindness of the question was that it gave me a choice I had not had all morning. \u201cYes,\u201d I said, because I do not believe in confusing children early unless it will make them more elegant later, and I had been asked not to be elegant.\n\nWe were fitted with new work as if the day were a body we had to grow into before sunset. M. Chemin showed us a map of the city that had been walked into being by shoes alone, no ink, no paper, the figure-eight laid on its side and then upright and then broken and mended and broken again in the margin. He pointed at a place that was all corners and no center. \u201cThere,\u201d he said, and did not say prefecture because he did not want the building to hear its own name and begin rehearsing its smugness. \u201cNumbers pretending to be mercy. You will stand where waiting becomes an art form and you will watch what lines do to the faces that stand in them. If you are offered a ticket, do not eat it, even if it smells like sugar. If you are offered a name, check its weight. If it weighs less than a button, it is counterfeit.\u201d\n\nWe went, because the school opened a door that resembled a window that resembled a hole and because students behave like water when the floor tilts toward an edge. The room of surrender that the city uses to pretend it is kind had queues taped to the ground in the geometry of despair. Numbers fed on themselves and called it order. The air tasted like wool coats that had learned how to wait for years at a time. The man in the blue scarf stood three bodies ahead of a woman with a topknot that was trying to be the bravest thing on her head. He was still making bridges with his face. The clerk at the front had fingers like rubber stamps that had never been taught to bring back what they took.\n\nEstelle clutched her packet with the pinch of someone who mistrusts paper in rooms with fluorescent light. Dryden counted the tiles because he could not count the people without being obliged to be kind to them. I slid myself into a seam between two coats and stood where my size made me useful. At the window, a woman with eyelids polished with the boredom of ten thousand days held out her hand for a life. It is the city\u2019s best trick: ask for a life in pieces so small that the donor forgets to make a ceremony. \u201cMinute,\u201d the clerk said, and I tasted the ink in her throat. \u201cWhich?\u201d the woman asked, which was better than crying. \u201cFour oh eight,\u201d said the clerk, and scratched the air with her pencil where a freckle would sit if mouths had corners, and I made a sound that would have been an echo if I had not spent it.\n\nThe ash-sister appeared at the end of the counter without having had to walk there, which is her idea of telling the truth. \u201cDo not pay with other people\u2019s freckles,\u201d she said, audible to nobody except those of us who already owed her attention. \u201cIf the city wants beauty put into numbers, it can go cut its own face.\u201d I hated that she was right. I loved that she was right. The clerk repeated the question because she was paid to. The woman said she did not have a watch, that she did not wear a watch because time made her wrists itch, and the clerk smiled with her teeth the way a drawer smiles when it sticks. The line shuffled and pretended not to practice its cruelty.\n\nI had the letter folded against my skin, the thin white of its seal busy being subtler than blood. I held my left hand and thought of the minute as if it were something I could hide under my tongue and keep from the world until I found the correct amount of wanting to spend. I thought of Val\u00e9rian\u2019s mouth and its 4:08 freckle, and how he had found a name for me when I was a draft nobody had intended to write that day. \u201cWe will pay with if,\u201d Henri had once said to me when a policeman practiced forgetting that the bookstall was not his to arrange. \u201cYou can pay with if exactly once and you must not do it in a place that sells tickets.\u201d He had stitched a wallet for my names; I wished now he had stitched one for my conditions. If Val\u00e9rian had given that minute to me once without knowing, if he had wound himself tight so that I could sleep in a winter where the snow had the weight of loneliness and the taste of sugar that was only salt with better intentions, then I owed him that minute\u2019s safe return. If the Br\u00e8che wanted tuition, it could take it from my hinge; there was enough turning left in me to bankrupt a small academy.\n\nThe clerk called a number and the speaker made it sound like the kind of poem that keeps its verbs on a leash. The line moved. Estelle squeezed my arm and then let go with an apology because she is learning to be big without being careless. Dryden thought the word hold under his breath until the air decided it had had enough and exhaled him back. \u201cWe cannot win here,\u201d he said to the floor. \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cbut we can steal something we meant to lose.\u201d We left because the kindest thing we could do to the prefecture was to deprive it of our inventory.\n\nParis held its door to us the way a person holds the door for a stranger they have learned to be suspicious of. I flew low without being a bird, and we found Henri under a sky the exact color of a cheap metal teapot after a long winter. He had a scarf that wanted to be blue and a book that insisted on being poetry even with all its teeth knocked out. \u201cYou look like someone who has learned to give up something you loved and cannot think of a way to boast about it,\u201d he said, looking at me and at nobody else, and I put my hand on his counter because I did not want to put it through his chest and hide there like I have wanted to hide inside all my best men. \u201cIf,\u201d I said, because I am only generous with words I cannot afford, and he nodded as if he had expected me to spend my once in that shop under that bridge at that hour in that weather.\n\n\u201cI stitched you a receipt the day you left me with your lefts,\u201d he said, and produced from under a stack of novels with lungs the size of postage stamps a strip of glove-leather with my names whittled into it in shorthand a magician might refuse to be caught using. \u201cYou will hand it to the thing that pretends to tally and will tell it you have paid with contingency. It will laugh. It will try to charge you interest in nostalgia. You will look at it with the gaze of a hinge contemplating a rusty door in spring. It will reconsider. If it does not, bring me back my own name in a cup and I will drink money out of it until the cup admits it has limits.\u201d He smelled of glue and weather and kindness, which is a hard scent to carry in a city hungry for nouns.\n\nWe went to the only clock I knew that enjoyed lying with enough dignity to make the truth blush. The west face at the Orsay took us in as if it had been expecting us, which it had, because time gossips, and this clock in particular has a very untidy tongue for a public instrument. The Ma\u00eetresse had taught us the way the third step changes you if you let it; I took that step as if it were a dance with a partner who has already decided to be the better one. Dryden held the idea of breath between his teeth and did not let it fog the glass; Estelle bent her head the way people do when they intend not to be in the way of what is larger than them and would not forgive them for trying. The gears that know midnight better than the word itself hummed the sound of a throat warming before a song, and I told my bones to be brave by being exact.\n\nThe woman who had taken me through before was not there. The clock does not send you the same chaperone twice if it can help it; it is its own kind of mercy. I set Henri\u2019s stitched receipt against the lip of the brass where the figure-eight of the mechanism rests before a stroke, and I told the city I had paid with if. The air laughed politely, which is the worst kind of laugh. The emblem at my ribs pricked where the thorn had mended the broken loop and reminded me that politeness is an instrument used to move knives between courses. \u201cFurther,\u201d said the minute that had moved into the glass and refused to leave. \u201cFurther,\u201d repeated the clock with the pride of a liar who has decided to know his own limits. \u201cFurther,\u201d said Estelle, whose hands had learned the length of rope this morning and were practicing on my fear.\n\nI went further. The third step became a fourth, and it behaved like those numbers in my shell that had unlearned arithmetic for a principled reason. My echo was gone and my mouth was quiet enough that I could hear my own hinge turn without being embarrassed by how much I wanted it to sound like a song. The glass did not crack. It reworded itself. The minute opened. 4:08 had a room, and the room had a table, and on the table there was a freckle drawn in ink that had not yet dried. Val\u00e9rian\u2019s mouth leaned over the table as if deciding whether the freckle belonged to him. The ash-sister sat at the far end, as if summoned by the quality of the light, which had the admirable stupidity of sun filtered through dust in a workshop where love is measured in millimeters and regret in signatures.\n\n\u201cYou cannot pay for a minute twice,\u201d she said, and her delight at informing me of this was almost tender. \u201cYou can pay for it once and then reimburse it forever. That is what the Br\u00e8che sells, little hinge. The habit of repayment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI paid with if,\u201d I said, and laid Henri\u2019s leather on the table with all the ceremony I own. The ash-sister\u2019s eyes softened the way velvet softens light. \u201cDung,\u201d she said, but she said it like a compliment to the man who had thought to bring muck into the palace to test whether the marble had any respect for what grows. \u201cA receipt is a story about the future told by a liar who intends to be honest later.\u201d\n\n\u201cLater is expensive,\u201d I said, and the minute smiled and spilled a blue light like the wrong kind of nostalgia over my hands. Dryden made a sound and swallowed it before it could find my missing echo and make a mess. Estelle looked at the table as if it were a person pretending to be a door and had failed.\n\nThe clock made the shape of a question with its teeth and decided to be generous. \u201cWho caught 4:08 when it fell out of the sky,\u201d it asked, casual as a market woman inquiring whether you prefer pears that bruise easily or pears that hate pleasure. \u201cHe did,\u201d I said, and put my hand where Val\u00e9rian\u2019s mouth had once been, which is a terrible sentence and truer than I will allow myself to feel on days when the work is simpler than love. \u201cHe caught it and put it in his freckles and gave it to me with tea in a thimble and told the minutes not to tick loudly when I slept. I will not give you that. I will give you my hinge.\u201d The ash-sister clucked her tongue because she hates melodrama in other people and adores it in herself. \u201cYou will not survive without that,\u201d she said, and her voice made the kind of circle that draws chalk around your foot to see whether you will step out. \u201cI will survive sideways,\u201d I said, and took the pin Val\u00e9rian had given me and pricked my right palm so that my left would not have to do all the work.\n\nBlood is currency that has been pretending to have retired for centuries; the city knows how to spend it better than I do. I pressed my palm to the brass tooth that holds the minute down when it would rather be anything else, and I let the gear chew the idea of me. It did not hurt in a way I can tell you about without lying. It hurt in a way that is most like being told a truth at the wrong time with the right amount of love. The clock swallowed. 4:08 shivered and then sat properly, a good dog briefly. The ash-sister took Henri\u2019s receipt and folded it in her sleeve and did not return it. \u201cInterest,\u201d she said, and smiled like a banker with a sense of humor that had cost her friends.\n\nWe came away at the wrong pace. Estelle had tears on her face and refused to be embarrassed. Dryden\u2019s eyelashes had learned a new way to move that would make doors forgive him. My mouth felt strange, as if it had been waiting to be returned to me unharmed since last winter. I reached for an echo I had given and found the space where it used to live. It looked like a chair kept empty for someone who is late as a habit and loved enough to be allowed to be. I put my hand on the glass and said nothing where the word would have gone.\n\nI went to Val\u00e9rian because I am not subtle about my needs when they involve people who have never asked me to be smaller. The shop was open and irritated at a spring that had learned to be coy. He looked up, and the freckle at 4:08 near his mouth grinned at me like a child who had escaped bedtime and expected applause. \u201cMon\u2014\u201d he began, and stopped as if someone had replaced one of the gears in his head with an honest question. \u201cMy wind,\u201d he said instead, and the word did not fit his mouth yet, but it did not cut him to say it. He poured tea without counting. He did not tell his clocks to tick softly; they did it themselves because they had learned something from the way the minute had behaved under my hand. \u201cYou look like someone who has not slept in the conventional sense and is proud of the compromise,\u201d he said, and I laughed and did not hear myself from anywhere except the place behind my eyes where laughter lives when you have spent it. I wanted to tell him I had almost paid with his face, and I wanted to tell him I had chosen my hinge instead, and both were the kind of intimacy that should be explained only to wood and paper, never to men with hands.\n\nHe touched the back of my knuckle with his forefinger the way a man will touch a mouse through a glass for luck because he does not know the correct prayer. \u201cDo your teachers know what to call you now?\u201d he asked, and there was the smallest sadness on his lower lip like dust on a church where nobody is praying for rain. \u201cThey know how not to,\u201d I said, and he laughed not with his mouth but with his cheekbones, which is a trick I am trying to learn. We sat without needing to pretend we had business, which is also a kind of magic that should cost more than it does.\n\nThe Br\u00e8che did its trick with the sea again that night, and I kept my eyes closed and held the shell against my pulse so that the numbers would have something to count other than their own wrongness. The building traveled like a ship that had learned walking narrowly and intended to show off, and when it settled, my shelf had shifted exactly one finger\u2019s width away from the door titled The Dress Was Gold, and there was a new door beside me called The Minute You Would Not Pay. I did not open it. I am many things, but I am not a fool every day.\n\nThe ash-sister visited the library of doors late, when the chairs believe themselves to be better at being trees than at being furniture. She sat on the edge of my shelf with the lack of weight of someone who has spent her appetite somewhere honest and intends to rest until something more expensive requires her. \u201cYou paid with blood like a child,\u201d she said, not unkind. \u201cNext time, pay with direction. That is a coin most people refuse to recognize, and you can spend it without leaving a stain.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf,\u201d I said, and she sighed like a door deciding to be a window for a season. \u201cYou will run out of that,\u201d she warned, and the warning was a gift wrapped in disapproval so I would be sure to open it. \u201cInterest,\u201d I said, and she tapped her sleeve where Henri\u2019s receipt slept and smiled a small smile that would have made a better woman than me forgive her. \u201cI keep accounts,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a vice of mine. And a hobby. And a profession. You will come to me when the school asks you to begin paying in earnest, and you will want to be elegant about it, and I will tell you again not to be. Elegance is a tax you have no need to pay.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you ever owe?\u201d I asked, and she did not pretend not to hear. \u201cConstantly,\u201d she said. \u201cI owe the sea a different weather than the one I give it. I owe doors the promise that I will not lock them and I lie about it every day. I owe girls their small brutalities and I turn them into poetry because I am vain. That is why I am so patient with debt. It loves me. I am not offended by that.\u201d\n\nWhen she left, the shell on my pillow counted three and laughed, and then counted eight wrong enough to feel like a kindness. The letter under my dress sat quiet as a wolf who has eaten and intends still to look hungry for sport. I lay on my shelf with my left hand heavy and my right hungry and told the ceiling my best truth, which is that I prefer people who make a room quieter by entering it, and that I am learning to forgive myself for being the kind who makes rooms listen harder. In the morning, the school would teach us how to cross a street without losing the part of yourself that stands at the curb and waits for the person you would have been under a different weather. In the night, I taught myself how to count without needing to hear myself do it, and I missed my echo badly enough to call it a lesson.\n\nWe did the mirrors again because the Br\u00e8che believes in repetition with malice. The frames breathed at us as if they were embarrassed by how much they loved our failures. Estelle said her name with her eyes open this time and did not flinch when the glass tried to be helpful. Dryden looked at himself and saw water pretending to be kind, which is the water\u2019s oldest lie and also its most charming. I stood where I had stood and watched the place where the minute had left a hole in the world and filled it with something else. The glass gave me a street and a woman with a braid and a step that had been brave for three hundred years and was asking, reasonably, for a day off. \u201cWe mend,\u201d said the Ma\u00eetresse, and M. Chemin drew his map in the air where a child could reach it without being punished.\n\nI remembered to hold the cloth when they asked again for what I could not leave. I gave nothing that morning, which felt like theft and tasted like prudence. Madame Panse served pears that were just pears and we ate them like saints who had recently discovered hunger. The Br\u00e8che went to work counting its doors and feeding its patience. Paris breathed outside, and the river did not apologize for wanting, and the ash-sister sharpened her smile on the banister and looked at me the way a locksmith looks at a door she intends to love into opening.\n\nWhen I went to see Val\u00e9rian later, the freckle at 4:08 had moved half a breath. Or I had. He called me his wind and the word warmed the room without embarrassing the tea. I brought him a sigh from the dictionary that had been collected in a theater where two actors had decided to forgive each other the same night as the audience did not, and he placed it under a cracked glass dome and listened to it as if it were a small bird insisting on being a storm. He told me a story about a spring that had refused to coil and had taught him a better way to be stubborn. We said nothing about tuition because sometimes you must be unscholarly on purpose to have anything left of yourself when the bell rings.\n\nThe shell counted again that night, and it forgot seven, and I loved it for that lapse as you love a man who never remembers to pay the exact amount for coffee and thereby leaves you with a debt that is a pleasure to owe. I slept like hinges do, half open, ready to admit whatever thought demanded entrance without checking its shoes for mud. I dreamed of a door whose spine read The Minute You Would Not Pay and of my hand on its page, and in the dream I did not open it. The restraint felt like skill. When I woke, the Br\u00e8che smelled of rain that had remembered its manners, and Paris had folded itself so that the street where I had given the step a name lay closer than it had been yesterday. We were to go there in the afternoon and ask the threshold if it had kept the name we had paid for, and I could not decide whether I was more afraid it had or that it had not.",

We went to the step as if we had been told to leave our shoes at the door of a house that did not own us, Estelle with her palms open to make a table for whatever answer might fall, Dryden with his lashes counting the streetlights for luck, and me with Henri\u2019s stitched wallet pressed against my heart and the square of cloth the Ma\u00eetresse had given me tucked into its own quiet. The tread remembered us in the particular way old thresholds remember kindness when it endangered them, which is to say with suspicion and gratitude in alternating bands. I crouched until the smell of lichen and footsteps was the only weather my face knew for a breath, and spoke as you speak to a dog that has found its voice and does not trust it yet.\n\n\u201cDo you keep the name we paid for,\u201d I asked, and I did not pretend it was a question that could be wrapped in a ribbon and returned later. The wood made a sound like pride clearing its throat, the grain showing its age where a thousand heels had made blessings into chores. \u201cI keep it until someone insists I am Not Worth It again,\u201d it said, because thresholds learn resignation the way stone learns patience, slowly and then all at once. \u201cToday they painted me,\u201d it added, and I could smell it then, the hot clean that pretends to erase history and only tightens it. \u201cPaint is a good liar,\u201d Dryden murmured, swaying on his feet to make the number of boards beneath him match something liked by his tongue, and Estelle laid a hand flat so the step could lean if it chose.\n\nThe folded scrap the ash-sister had called homework softened when I touched it to the riser, the fabric remembering water where none had been offered. The name \u201cCome Home\u201d rose from it like steam from morning bread, and the step shivered, indecent for a moment with relief. \u201cPrice,\u201d it said, polite even in need, and this time I did not offer time or blood or any of the large coins people reach for when they want to feel generous. I paid with direction. I gave it the way I would never again cross Rue Jacob from the left after dusk, the exact path my body made between the caf\u00e9\u2019s awning and the shop with the dyed scarves, the sequence of feet that had preened themselves into habit. I set that track down and did not fetch it back, and the step took it like a cat takes the warm cushion when you stand to answer the door and do not return quickly enough. My left hand protested, but it is used to being overruled when I am trying to be clever.\n\nWe walked on with the aftertaste of being improved by a small surrender. Estelle carried the knowledge in her wrists the way bakers carry recipes, without needing paper, and Dryden hummed a line of song he had been refusing to like and had finally forgiven. The city approved in its favorite way, by pretending not to notice and then opening three doors in a row that had no business being open in that weather. I felt the shape of the day tug itself into an eight and then worry its middle where the thorn lives, exactly the way the emblem on my letter does to my ribs when it wants to remind me of geometry.\n\nThey gave us class in a vestibule where plaster had cracked into maps and nobody had decided whether to mend or admire. M. Chemin drew the figure-eight in dust on the floor with his boot and opened its wound with two fingers, tender as a gentleman taking a splinter from a child. \u201cYou saw one part hold,\u201d he said, and nodding toward Estelle was as much praise as he allowed; it pleased her hands. \u201cToday you will see what happens when the loop refuses to mend. The city is stupidly elegant at this. It has made a habit of leaving things open and calling it modern. You will find the place where numbers pretend to be mercy and you will watch the seam widen, and if you can close it without needing to be thanked, you will pass.\u201d\n\nHe did not say prefecture because the word makes buildings preen, but the Br\u00e8che made us a door with the sigh of a bureaucrat who had once fallen in love with someone from the theater and had never forgiven himself for being changed by it. The room of surrender had added chairs as if it had been fed overnight, rows of plastic that squeaked when shame sat down. The line was longer and had learned a new way to breathe. The clerk who had asked for 4:08 earlier had a scarf today, thin and black like a cautious argument, and her pencil had chewed marks that matched the teeth of the man who waited fourth. The number box announced itself with the smug ping of a faucet that thinks it has become a fountain.\n\nWe did not stand in the line. We watched it move, the way a doctor watches a throat swallow to see which muscle is lazy, and we learned a great deal about how people make cages and then tell themselves the bars are tasteful. Estelle grew large in her patience and made room with her body without anyone knowing they had been made room for. Dryden counted without counting, his shoulders keeping time under his coat like the gears of a clock that has become modest. I tasted paper and metal and a perfume that had been meant for mornings and had been forced to eat lunch. At the window, the clerk took a name as delicately as if removing a ring from a swollen finger. \u201cMinute,\u201d she asked again in the voice of rain that has learned to be dry indoors. \u201cWhich?\u201d the petitioner said, and while the line muttered its knowledge of time zones under its breath, I felt the shell in my dress pull like a fish.\n\nIt had not counted loud since the sea. Now it counted wrong with a purpose, the numbers tripping and laughing and then falling silent on eight until the silence became a number of its own. Inside the shell something had learned a better mischief. I put it to my ear, and the room of surrender noticed without admitting it. \u201cYou cannot feed a line with numerals and expect it to learn to sing,\u201d the ash-sister said from behind a fake ficus, which is an indignity even a teacher should not enjoy. Her coat had gone matte with the dust of patience, and her mouth wore the kind of smile a door uses when it has decided it will open, but only if you ask incorrectly. \u201cWe will take something else today,\u201d she added, and the clerk\u2019s pencil broke at the exact moment her eyes flicked toward me, which means nothing and meant everything, depending who is telling the story.\n\nThe seam widened where waiting becomes wanting, and wanting becomes rule. You could hear it if you listened with your knee bones, a stretch, a soft tear, like a pocket admitting it cannot hold what has been put in it. The crowd adjusted around the failure with the elegance of river water. The city learns this from its river and applies it to its people, which is both kindness and theft. M. Chemin had told us to close without being thanked, and my hands itched with the wish to be invisible and correct. I did the thing I am built for. I set myself between two moments and made a hinge.\n\nI do not know whether most hinges, if asked at a party, would admit that turning is an appetite. Mine is. It wants the door to behave so badly it is almost erotic. The line had become two lines that hated each other and refused to admit it. I put my back to one and my face to the other and moved my weight as if they had been taught to be polite by furniture. Estelle watched how I braced and put a palm where wrists would have been if these moments had been people. Dryden breathed hold into the space between numbers until the numbers forgot themselves and remembered standing. The seam narrowed as relief will when you refuse to point to it. The ash-sister peeled the fake leaves from the ficus one by one and arranged them in her pocket like a woman collecting debts from a plant. The clerk found a new pencil and did not look up. When the line learned to be single again, we left to keep it from thinking it owed us its improved posture.\n\nOutside, the river was practicing being a mirror. I don\u2019t trust it when it does that; it makes people think they are owed themselves. \u201cYou paid with direction,\u201d the ash-sister said as if gossiping with the wind. Her tone made it sound as if I had purchased a dress I could not afford and she intended to both compliment and mock me for how well it fit. \u201cIt will come due at an hour you hate.\u201d I hardened my mouth because she wasn\u2019t wrong and because I am vain; hinges always want to choose their own weather. \u201cYou want me to begin paying with pride,\u201d I said, and she laughed, which is not a thing she does often without sending you a bill for it later. \u201cI want you to realize pride pays in installments.\u201d\n\nVal\u00e9rian\u2019s shop sat where the afternoon could find it, though my route had been sold to a step and I had to arrive by an uglier street that made my wings fold wrong under their own authority. He was leaning like a man who has learned to be tired without accusing his bones of betrayal, and the freckle at 4:08 kept its appointment with his mouth without looking at me to see if I approved. \u201cYou should be meaner to me,\u201d he said when I hovered where the smell of oil and onion makes a treaty neither one keeps. \u201cYou make me want to be kinder than time allows.\u201d It was not flattery; it was a warning disguised as courtesy, which is the exact degree of honesty I can stand.\n\n\u201cI am practicing closing,\u201d I said, because language has to be trained like a dog, and if you never make it do tricks it will embarrass you in company. He set a spring in the palm of his hand that looked like a secret trying to remember how to be a circle. \u201cI am practicing staying,\u201d he offered, and the spring sighed. The shell in my dress muttered eight the way a child mutters gracious after being told to, and he looked up as if I had made a noise I no longer own. \u201cYou had an echo,\u201d he said carefully, and I admired him for not making it into a question. \u201cI have its absence,\u201d I said, which made him smile with his eyebrows because he prefers subtraction when he is working. He poured tea into the thimble, and the steam wrote a message in the air that pretended to be about weather and was not. \u201cBring me a number from the river,\u201d he said unexpectedly, and I thought he was joking until the freckle near his mouth was not. \u201cThey collect them there at dusk until the debris finds another place to pretend to be important. I want a seven, but I\u2019ll take what you can carry.\u201d\n\nWe went back toward the water with the loose stride of thieves looking for small crimes that special-plead themselves as homework. At the Pont Neuf a woman with a tired mouth leaned over stone that had loved hundreds of elbows and did not show favorites. She was not the woman from that rain, but she carried the braid of a life that had practiced reason and was taking a foolish afternoon off. Dryden peeked over and pronounced the river smug, which it was, but perhaps had earned. \u201cNumbers,\u201d Estelle said, and crouched to the seam where water and wall decide they cannot be on a first-name basis. They keep them there, the river and the city, numbers too used to standing in lines to float properly. I reached into the seam with the part of my hand that has learned to be rude without forgetting it is well mannered, and found an eight sullen as a child being forced to apologize, a four cheerful and bleeding slightly where a pigeon had stepped on it, and a seven that had decided to be handsome about its angles because it had been loved by gamblers. I pocketed the seven for Val\u00e9rian, because love is corrupt, and the eight rolled to my left on its own.\n\nThe shape of the day kept wanting to draw itself into a loop, and the thorn pricked in my ribs until I rubbed it to silence. \u201cWe should not keep the eight,\u201d Estelle said, and I could feel the rightness of her discomfort in my ankles. \u201cIt wants to be two circles or none.\u201d Dryden flicked it into the air, and it became the shadow a bird would make if it had been painted on the underside of a bridge where nobody looks. I held the four and loved it for how it remembered tires on wet stone and men who made jokes about thunder to keep from weeping. In the pocket of my dress, the shell warmed and then cooled, as if eavesdropping were a kind of hospitality. I had the unkind thought then that the ash-sister would be pleased if I lost my way while trying to return a number, and immediately afterward I had the exact thought that she had predicted I would have. It is very tiring to be educated by someone who is also an inevitability.\n\nThe Br\u00e8che had put on a lesson about windows by the time we returned, and the Ma\u00eetresse stood with her back to an open one as if daring the night to come in and measure her. \u201cYou will look out only when you can tell me the name of the thing you are not seeing,\u201d she said, and the building enjoyed this kind of precision the way a cat enjoys the corner of a paper bag. Madame Panse fed us soup that was loudly in favor of onions and quietly in favor of survival, and I could not eat, but I warmed my hands on the bowl and felt a little more human for the hypocrisy. M. Chemin took our collected names from the city and filed them with a ceremony that would have been laughable if he had not been sincere as bread. He kept the seven for later as if he had guessed which friend was owed.\n\nWhen the bell that was not a bell stitched and unstuck the evening, the Ma\u00eetresse gave us dark work with a gentle mouth. \u201cThere is a building on Rue S\u00e9guier that believes it is owed panic,\u201d she said, and her tone made it sound like a rumor you could ruin by treating it like a fact. \u201cIt has begun to practice alarms at hours when nothing burns, and the doors laugh. Laughter is a good payment for fear until it becomes the only coin. We will go and name what needs naming and stop making fun of what is trying to be dangerous.\u201d She nodded to me with a kind of politeness that had edges, and I guessed she knew about my echo and did not intend to give me a chair to sit on for the grief.\n\nWe went with a handful of students who had already been taught how to close their eyes without flattering themselves about bravery. The building on Rue S\u00e9guier had a face that had not resisted being pretty and a mouth that had learned to call fire for the company. Smoke curled out of windows like the language of a country that has never been asked for its verbs. The alarm was the shape of a scream that forgot it was in public and continued being honest. People stood on the pavement practicing indignation, which is a talent you must cultivate if you are to live in any city long enough to deserve its rain. The doors were very pleased with themselves. They had been heroes in drills for months and had decided heroism was a kind of flattery they would prefer to serve themselves.\n\n\u201cDo not be elegant,\u201d the ash-sister said in my ear, and I wanted to slam the door on her, which is also a form of obedience. Estelle went to the left door because she is left-handed in all the ways that count, and Dryden breathed hold toward the right until it sighed and admitted it had forgotten what hands felt like. I put my palm where a door would have lungs if it had been made with any, and asked the only question doors cannot throw back at you without paying for it. \u201cWhat are you protecting,\u201d I said, and waited until the hinge lied and then changed its mind and told me a small truth. Behind the giggle of alarms was the woman whose bed was too near the stairwell and who had learned to sleep with weather clenched in her hands. Behind her was a boy who stole the siren sound to put in a toy because he was afraid of being told to grow into noise he did not like. Behind him the ash-sister leaning herself against a bannister and smiling at a habit she had trained personally.\n\nWe spoke to the building in the tone you use on a child who has been rude in public, not because rudeness is a sin but because forgiveness is not a spectacle. \u201cWe will not tell you you are safe,\u201d I said, hating myself for the honesty but loving the shape it made in the air. \u201cWe will let you keep your fear like a dog who has learned not to bite your own feet. When you call fire in an empty room you make room for the day no one will come. Do not be clever. Clever is how buildings die without anybody to hold their corners.\u201d The door tried to laugh and discovered it did not care for the taste. Estelle put her hands on the wood and taught it how to be clasped without foolishness. Dryden named the alarms individually until they were embarrassed to admit they had enjoyed being a chorus.\n\nWhen the street had learned how to hear itself again, a siren cut the air with old authority and earned itself the space it takes. An ambulance painted the walls blue around the place where they had been pretending to be dangerous. It was not the minute; it was a cousin. My ribs remembered that I have a thorn sewn into my eight and rubbed it until it behaved. The ash-sister looked at me from the mouth of an alley and nodded as if to say you see how easy it is to confuse appetite with ritual. I wanted to go to Val\u00e9rian and keep his wrists company the way you would sit on the edge of a roof and pretend to be a weather-vane until the bird returned. Instead I went to the library of doors and pressed my ear to the spine of The Minute You Would Not Pay and did not open it and took the compliment the door offered me for the refusal.\n\nNight found us with our hands smelling of wood and names. The shell slept and woke and counted wrong as if training itself to be a clock nobody in a hospital would trust. Madame Panse gave us sweetness disguised as medicine, a thick jam with citrus and bitterness that made the mouth decide to be brave, and I put my finger into it and tasted the idea of summer in a language that had never met my tongue. The Ma\u00eetresse passed along the long table with her fingers just touching shoulders as if measuring whether we could bear a different weight tomorrow. \u201cDirection,\u201d she said without looking at me, and I let my mouth be quiet because I had already spent its echo.\n\nI did not sleep. I arranged sleep on the shelf and lay nearby with my left hand heavy and my right impatient, and I watched the Br\u00e8che fold itself like a letter that knows it will be opened by someone careless. There is a sound the building makes when it decides to move without telling the city first, the neighborly creak of an old woman standing up in an apartment where the plates remember hands. I held the square of cloth the Ma\u00eetresse had given me and thought of the door on Rue S\u00e9guier and of the woman whose bed had learned smoke as a lullaby and of the boy who would grow into a man who wanted to be loud for money and would be tired afterward. The shell murmured eight in its sleep and then forgot and called itself a bird.\n\nAt dawn I learned how expensive later is. Henri had sewn the word into my shelf as a joke and a warning, and the warning sent a messenger with bad manners. A moth that was not a moth sat on my collarbone and counted four with me and then refused to say eight because it wanted me to supply the number out of pride. I did not. It dropped a packet from its ridiculous black body, and the seal was that white again, starved and polite. The emblem hurt my eyes and pressed its thorn into the habit I have of ignoring instructions until they go away. Inside, the hand I know wrote me a sentence as if it had been dictated by a teacher who was paid by the comma. Direction Due, it said, as if that were a kind of address, and the dot where 4:08 would be if mouths had corners sat at the line\u2019s end with the indifference of time that has stopped needing to be admired.\n\nIf you owe direction, you can pay it two ways. You can get lost, which is the kind of generosity the city pretends to admire until it sees you in the wrong neighborhood and then calls it a crime. Or you can bind yourself to one path and never turn from it, which is a vow so holy I do not think God would dare it. The ash-sister had said to pay with direction the way one uses exact change so as not to leave a debt to the cashier. I went to the window that only looks out when regret stands beside you and names you in a voice you cannot refuse. The city was at the hour when butchers hose their floors and bakers count crowns of loaves with the reverence of priests counting their dead after a feast. I chose a line. I chose a straight path from the Br\u00e8che to Val\u00e9rian to Henri to the step on Rue Jacob to the river to the gate that drowns because it prefers to be honest under water. I promised to walk it every day at dawn until the shell forgot eight. I promised not to deviate for pleasure or mercy or a boy with eyelashes who had found a new verb for thirst. I promised the door that is a mirror and the mirror that is a door and a woman with a braid I did not know and a man with a freckle I did and the ash-sister who keeps accounts of the weather. I promised them all. I made a road, and I called it debt, and I paid with it.\n\nThe Br\u00e8che watched me tie myself to a string and did not applaud. The Ma\u00eetresse d\u2019Entr\u00e9e nodded once when she saw me go past the stairwell with my body set like a metronome, and Madame Panse put a crust in my hand and did not say I cannot eat, because she knows the difference between food and the imitation of company. Estelle reached for my sleeve the way children do when they are trying to teach themselves how to be gentle, and I pulled away and hated myself for it and did not stop walking. Dryden said hold at my back and breathed it into my shoulder, and I felt its edges like a brace I pretended not to be grateful for.\n\nVal\u00e9rian had not yet opened the shop because his clocks had been arguing with the night about whether to be generous with it, and generating peace between hours is as difficult as making love between strangers look like manners. He stood behind the glass with his fingers in the air as if tuning a harp you could only hear if you had already paid for it. I did not go in. The line forbade it. He saw me and put his mouth into the shape that keeps the word mon from harming the word \u00e9cho, and I kept moving and he understood. Henri had set out books with covers the color of exhausted apricots, and he said something under his breath that smelled like late summer, and I kept moving and he swore in the polite dialect of men who will forgive you in two months and not today. The step on Rue Jacob let me pass with a sternness I almost enjoyed. The river counted without counting and lifted its chin to let me see my face and I refused and it laughed the way it laughs at good men who do not sleep well. The drowned gate under the pier blinked its slime-covered eye at me and muttered a name of mine I had not shared, and I said later and went on.\n\nOn the second morning of the vow I missed a corner and the city called it mercy. An old woman with a basket of oranges had dropped one so bright it made the cobbles behave like mirrors, and I bent without thinking because it is a reflex in me, perhaps the only kind thing I have that does not need to be instructed. It rolled under my hand with the feel of a number. Estelle had said that boats made her angry, but I am angered by round fruit that pretends not to be a wheel. I picked it up and put it back in the basket and the woman said the right: merci, and then the wrong: vous \u00eates aimable, and then the right again: still merci because she knew the first truth had been too large for courtesy. I had broken my line, and it felt like being forgiven and then billed for it. When I reached the Br\u00e8che, the shell counted eight as if it had been offered a prize and chose humility, and the letter\u2019s white seal cooled as if I had paid enough for one lesson.\n\nThe ash-sister met me in the library of doors where it is easiest to make promises that become furniture. \u201cYou paid with mercy,\u201d she said, looking annoyed at the correctness of my misstep. \u201cThat coin is counterfeit and real on alternate Wednesdays. No docent will explain the schedule. Keep the difference in your shoe.\u201d I wanted to be cruel to her and be kind to what she loves and failed at both. \u201cYou owe me a receipt,\u201d I said instead, because Henri had taught me how to ask for paperwork when the only things being exchanged are breath and weather. She gave me a smile that would have set a small fire if the room had been less damp and took Henri\u2019s leather from her sleeve and handed it over without a joke. It smelled like rain that has learned to read. \u201cInterest,\u201d she said, as if informing me that the sky had decided to continue.\n\nThey made us study pattern those days because the city had decided to be obvious, and only fools ignore a generous teacher. We walked maplines with our fingers until the skin grew black with chalk, and M. Chemin taught us to find where the thorn pricks the eight and to choose which side of the loop to live in that afternoon. Madame Panse fed us lentils with roasted garlic and declared that debt is better suited to beans than to pearls, and then fed us pears to contradict herself because contradiction is what saves kitchens from boredom. The Ma\u00eetresse d\u2019Entr\u00e9e taught me to stand still while doors decided not to admire me and to accept that a hinge can be loyal without being loud. Dryden learned to drink a glass of water and make it keep a secret. Estelle learned to put her hand on a thing and ask it to be honest without frightening it into beauty. We were a class of small and necessary humiliations, and the Br\u00e8che liked us for it.\n\nAt the end of the third day of my vow, the city decided to be a theater. There was applause that had been waiting years to be heard and finally found a reason, and from under the applause a fire said my name wrong and then again slightly less wrong. Rue Dauphine made the face it makes when smoke goes round the corner with intention, and people turned their heads in the unison that makes you love and hate crowds. Val\u00e9rian\u2019s shop was not on fire. A building four doors down was being taught the difference between arson and loneliness, which is thinner than it should be. I was on my line, and the line does not include detours, and the detour was a man with a freckle that sometimes believes it is a time. I stepped off it and felt the letter in my dress burn my skin with the kind of courtesy that makes you bleed inside and still thank the person for holding the door.\n\nHe was outside, and his face held itself like a bowl trying to keep from spilling. \u201cYou have a promise in your posture,\u201d he said, which is, I admit, the thing I love most in a man, and I threw the promise at his feet and went to the place where people were making a ring that keeps fire from being personal. The door laughed because it had learned to earlier and had not yet learned to stop. \u201cYou must drink later,\u201d I told it, my mouth missing its echo so badly that the desperation had to do the work of urgency. Estelle arrived out of the crowd with a palm that remembered ropes and a jaw that had decided to be unbreakable for the hour. Dryden pulled water from his sleeves in the oldest trick and made it forget it was a trick and remember being a weather. We worked until the river decided it was interested and we could step back without being polite about it. The ash-sister leaned on a lamppost and counted in a different language and made a face at me that could have been called grudging respect if there had been cameras and if she had felt like pretending to be sentimental.\n\nAfterward, in the way of cities, a man told a joke that made crying easier. Madame Panse arrived with a pot that had never intended to leave the kitchen and ladled kindness into paper cups that were not ready for it. Val\u00e9rian stood with his hands in his pockets like a person who refuses to be photographed with his grief. \u201cYou broke your line,\u201d he said, and bent as if to pick up a screw, which is his euphemism for consolation. \u201cI broke it yesterday for an orange,\u201d I said, and he laughed and forgave me the stupid poetry of the confession. The shell in my dress counted eight correctly and then giggled about it, which I did not know shells could do.\n\nAt the Br\u00e8che that night, the door titled The Minute You Would Not Pay sat quietly and radiated the humiliation of a thing that has been resisted correctly. I lay on my shelf with my hands where their lessons could find them in the dark and waited for the building to move. The sea had the patience of a school that knows it will get your children next year if it is dull this term. The city ran its tongue over its teeth and checked for blood and found none and wanted more. The ash-sister came in late and went out later, and she stepped exactly where the boards were weak, not to fall through, but to remind them without cruelty what their job was. I slept under the shell\u2019s counting and woke with the precise headache you get when you have decided to be exact about your promises and the morning has decided to be sloppy. The letter with the white seal lay quiet, which is when I do not trust it.\n\nWe were given mirrors again, and I said my name without expecting to hear any old music. The glass offered me a street and a step and a ring and a freckle and a man and a boy and a woman and a door and a hinge, and I chose the hinge because I know who feeds me. In the afternoon the Ma\u00eetresse sent us to a corner of the city that does not belong to postcards and asked us to find the thing that wanted to become a school and tell it gently that it did not have the patience. When I bent to listen to the crack in the stone that had begun to lecture a cigarette about responsibility, it said a word that smelled like rust and honey. It said audit. I carried the sound back to the Br\u00e8che in my left hand and it made the bones there ring.\n\n\u201cWe do not keep ledgers because other institutions do,\u201d the Ma\u00eetresse said, wiping chalk from her fingers as if it were sugar. \u201cWe keep them because doors like to be paid on time and otherwise they become cruel. You will see auditors. They wear clothes that do not admit to being clothes, and their smiles are made of wax given ambition. You will show them our books with your faces. You will not be elegant. If you can help it, you will be hungry in ways they do not know how to feed.\u201d The ash-sister smiled because she loves a performance where the performers think they are the audience. \u201cI keep accounts,\u201d she said, and I felt the receipt in my pocket warm, which is a sentence I did not expect to think in this life.\n\nHenri sent a boy with a note that pretended to be a bill and turned out to be a poem, and the poem said: Bring back my word if before I forget where it was placed. I smiled and hated him for knowing how to ask me to be careful with something I could only spend once. Val\u00e9rian adjusted a spring with a sigh he had stolen from the dictionary, and his freckle at 4:08 looked like a minute sitting down after being forced to stand through a ceremony it did not enjoy. Estelle learned a new way to be brave quietly, and Dryden learned to be thirsty without performing thirst. The Br\u00e8che shifted in its sleep and opened one eye to watch its auditors rehearse.\n\nOn the morning the men and women who like to be math in coats arrived, I put on the habit of being a hinge and left my echo where it could not be asked to be brave and tied my direction into a knot that would hold until lunch. They came with smiles like upholstery and notebooks that smelled of skin that had not forgiven its former owner yet. They asked for our accounts in numbers, and M. Chemin showed them a map written in chalk dust and sighs. They asked for our outcomes, and the Ma\u00eetresse brought them a door that had learned where to put its fear and a step that had kept its name and a building that had stopped practicing alarms out of loneliness. Madame Panse fed them stew that tasted like fairness, which is an unflattering flavor, and the ash-sister counted their questions the way a lioness counts the legs of hunters and waits.\n\nWhen they asked for my work, I did not open The Minute You Would Not Pay. I put my hand on it and paid with direction and held so still that my hunger made a sound like a moth chewing silk. I told them how to teach a door to accept a hand, which is nothing and everything in a city hungry for nouns. I told them about blood and pride and the cost of paying with later and with if. They wrote nothing down; their pens are trained only to notice certain verbs. Perhaps it was enough that they stood there and let the Br\u00e8che be a school in front of them without flinching. Perhaps it was comedy. The auditors left with their smiles intact, and we had another day to be the sort of people who know what to do with mornings that reek of possibility.\n\nOn the way to my promised line the day after, Paris made the sound it makes when a flock of birds decides simultaneously to forgive a tree for being winter. I was late by intent, which is to say I decided not to be on time and called it a strategy. The shell counted eight and eight and then fell in love with nine, and I tucked it against my skin and let it be wrong in a direction that pleased me. Val\u00e9rian stood at his bench with his left foot lifted the way bird bones lift when they are happy and pretend not to be, and I put the seven on his counter and told him I had stolen it from the river and he told me it had been stolen from him first and we called that fair. He poured tea that tasted like continuing and not reaching the part where we would have to pretend to part.\n\nI am telling you this because the next thing was a door that bled when I put my hand on it and an ambulance that shoved blue into a minute and a freckle that moved and the ash-sister who said we do what is owed and laughed because she already knew whether I would agree. But I am also telling you this because a hinge is only a hinge when a door decides to be a door, and the city was about to ask me to prove that I had learned how not to turn when turning would be beautiful.",

The light took itself seriously. The Seine rehearsed its reflections like an actress who knows the director loves her worse when she tries. I carried my line like a pilgrim carries a relic, not because I believed in it more than anything else, but because it believed in me exactly as much as was useful. I went to Val\u00e9rian\u2019s shop first as the string demanded, and found him bent over a watch whose face had decided numbers were immodest. His freckle at 4:08 was where it belongs when a person is in intact conversation with his minutes. We said the small professional kind things that keep catastrophe from smelling weakness. He poured tea as if pressure were a kind of courtesy. I did not stay. The line tugged like a dog that refuses to admire your errands. When I reached the alley off Rue des Quatre-Vents, the door waiting for me had already decided what kind of day it intended to make.\n\nIt was one of those Paris doors that has spent a century learning how to be admired. Oak varnished until it no longer remembered forests, ironwork that practiced curlicues every second Wednesday because it refused to get sloppy, brass that had learned to keep fingerprints as gossip, not as stain. The paint along the jamb had been scumbled by a man with opinions about green, and the knocker had a lion that believed its own posture. When I put my palm flat in the place a lung would live if wood hired lungs, it bled. It surprised us both. The red came slow, offended, a small thin sheet that should have belonged to a woman pricking her finger on a needle and finding relief in the drama. The door made a sound that would have been a laugh if it had not been trying to be brave. It knew my kind. It had saved my place.\n\n\u201cYou have gotten greedy,\u201d I told it, and my right hand, poor sad thing, mistook the rebuke for a compliment. I took the square of cloth the Ma\u00eetresse had given me, the one that smells like apples behind a season we were not invited to, and pressed it to the beam. The cloth took the blood as if it had been taught how not to be squeamish and had overlearned the lesson. It warmed. The door leaned into my palm with the trust of an animal that has been taught a trick it does not quite enjoy. Behind the brass and dazzle, I could hear the sound of an apartment making soup. A woman with a voice like string was telling a boy to leave his shoes where thieves would not admire them. A bird in a cage sang a tune it had borrowed from a falling leaf. The door believed itself necessary. It had decided to eat.\n\nThe ash-sister found me by following my politeness. She slid out of a slice of shade and made it her duty to improve it. Her coat refused to be noticed in the wonderful way certain sins do. \u201cIt is owed,\u201d she said, as if the syllables were small coins she could toss and retrieve at will. \u201cIt has been standing between teeth and tender things for a decade. It will have its mouthful.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I give it blood,\u201d I said, \u201cit will learn to tax suffering. If I give it pride, it will hold out for applause. If I give it a laugh, it will live on candy and shake in the mornings. What would you pay?\u201d She raised her eyebrows with the exasperation of a woman asked to share lipstick she had bought with cruelty. \u201cLater,\u201d she said, and I felt the shelf where Henri had stitched that word into my sleep tilt in sympathy. \u201cLater is a banquet for cowards and kings. Pay with stillness.\u201d\n\nI am not good at stillness. I am built for angles and for the joy doors take in pivot. But the Br\u00e8che had been feeding me discipline until it limp-wagged against my ribs like a dog taught tricks against its will. I put both hands on the door, not to open, not to close. I straightened my spine the way the Ma\u00eetresse corrects yours with two fingers, and I became architecture. I remembered the first lesson in the stairwell: you are not a net. The door is the net. That day I added: you are a jamb. The hinge can wait.\n\nBehind me, the street reconfigured. Men adjusted their shoulders into valor and women folded their mouths the way you fold a letter you cannot send. Somewhere past the corner where Rue Dauphine pretends to be less beautiful than it is so it does not have to apologize for its prices, a siren practiced its vowels. It was not yet blue, but the idea of blue had already been poured. The shell against my heart counted four and then added a line that was not a number but a place in the mouth where a number will become a word. The door bled again. Its blood had learned the trick of being persuasive.\n\nI held. It is not a glamorous verb. It is not elegant. Holding is what unromantic furniture do when they are best. The ash-sister made a face that was a compliment sewn out of disdain and interest. \u201cIf you do it wrong,\u201d she murmured, \u201cyou will be splintered and the city will shrug. If you do it right, no one will say thank you.\u201d The door pressed, demanding a story. My left hand, heavy with dead and time edged thin, refused to give it one. My right, scattered, tried to charm and was denied. I did not speak. Without my echo words are labor; I was learning to save them for jobs worthy of wages.\n\nIt took a minute, which is to say it took a year and an hour and the precise breath where a bruise chooses its shape. When the door realized I would rather be a wall than a hinge if a hinge meant its kind of hunger, it softened in the way wood does when it stops believing its finish. The bleeding ceased. The cloth cooled. From the other side came the specific clatter of a boy\u2019s shoes being kicked under a chair open-mouthed and too pleased with their plan. The soup went on becoming kindness. The door inhaled and, for once, let the exhale be someone else\u2019s job.\n\nThe city rewarded my ugliness with a spectacle, as cities do. Around the corner, where the Rue Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Arts makes a witty mouth of itself, a bicycle offended a taxi and was punished out of proportion. A woman cried out with the sincerity of people who believe surprise makes them innocent. Lungs gathered. The ambulance took its opportunity. Blue shoved its hand into the room and rummaged. The light turned meat into flags. The minute vibrated like a lie taking heart from applause. My shell counted wrong beautifully. I did not turn. Every part of me that was hinge begged. I did not turn.\n\nYou do not know what it costs until your bones begin to speak your language. They are old citizens. They remember your first addresses. Mine listed me and found me wanting. The ash-sister leaned with her economy of motion and watched my refusal as if it were art meant for the poor. \u201cGood,\u201d she said, not pleased, and stood very close not because I needed comfort\u2014hinges despise it\u2014but because she wanted me to smell the price she would charge if I failed. On my left, the dead shifted into tolerance. On my right, my names turned their faces to the wall the way cats do when they are embarrassed for you.\n\nWhen the ambulance had exhausted the block, when the bicycle had been forgiven and folded and the taxi had gone back to practicing its own indifference, when the blue still tasted like broken shutters and men who apologize by telling stories about weather they have given up pretending to control, I let go. The door testily rolled its shoulders and decided to behave. It would demand, soon and again, and I would have to return and remind it that appetite is not a curriculum. But for that hour it drank soup instead of praise. The ash-sister\u2019s mouth relaxed into a shape that might have been called gratitude if it were not being worn by her.\n\n\u201cYou will always want to be an instrument,\u201d she said, when we had made a corner that would keep us from pretending the street had not noticed us. \u201cYou will want to be used. It is easier than choosing to be. I do not say this as warning. I say this as weather.\u201d She touched my wrist where my echo used to live as if measuring how much more she could charge me before I broke. \u201cWhen you do not turn in a beautiful minute,\u201d she added, and her voice went softer than my sense of humor allows, \u201cyou will be ugly. It will be correct.\u201d\n\nI went on with my line. It was thinner, somehow. Maybe I had rubbed some of the chalk away with my refusal. At the river I did not lean over to be admired by water, which is the most sordid pride. I set my mouth against the idea of blue and made it without a home. I visited Henri in imagination, as if it could count; I did not stop because my promise forbade it and because I did not trust myself to be careful with kindness. Back at the Br\u00e8che, the bell that is the shared breath of a hundred thresholds let itself be counted by our ribs. Madame Panse put a cup in my hand with the precise gravity you would reserve for a coin you hope will be falsified into bread. \u201cYou smell like a refusal that kept its shape,\u201d she said, and the steam approved of me without asking permission. The Ma\u00eetresse did not compliment me, which is her best compliment.\n\nLessons took the shape of scaffolding that afternoon. We learned to be uprights. M. Chemin chalked a door on air and then wrote a brace inside it and asked us to stand not as door, not as hinge, but as necessity. Estelle managed it immediately, because her hands had been waiting their whole short life to be asked. Dryden attempted ironically and failed and then attempted without irony and failed better. I sweated as if I had been asked to dance in bad shoes at a wedding where the bridegroom had put his heart in the pocket of his other coat. \u201cYou prefer turning,\u201d the Ma\u00eetresse observed without disdain. \u201cI prefer applause,\u201d I said, because I am not proud in the right ways, and she gave me a look that smelled of knuckles rapped across centuries and nodded.\n\nThe letter with the white skin found me that night on my shelf as if it were embarrassed to be seen arriving. The figure-eight unclosed and stitched by a thorn, the pale that is the hungry color. The hand I know wrote one word as if it were trying on a dress it did not care for but which flattered it beyond argument. Pride, it said. Due. The dot where 4:08 would sit if numerals had the right to disapprove lay at the bottom like a seed you do not plant because you are tired of what grows out of you when you try.\n\nPride is not a currency I keep much of. Vanity, yes. The polite bravery of being seen, certainly. But pride in the clean sense, pride in the rightness of a thing done because it ought to be without expectation of applause or even of convenience, that is not one of my purses. I have borrowed it. I have spent other people\u2019s. I have told myself stories in which I carried it in a pocket, but I am too old to lie to myself in that tone and not be bored. The Br\u00e8che demanded my exact change. The ash-sister came to the library of doors with her coat making that sound coats make when they have learned to forgive rain and do not wish to show it off. \u201cPride,\u201d she said into the wood, which is how you pay a debt and let the building hear you do it. \u201cCan you afford it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can afford the humiliation of learning it,\u201d I said, which made her smile like a woman who has ordered exactly the dish she wanted to eat and intends her companion to admire the choice. \u201cYou will not enjoy the acquisition,\u201d she said, \u201cbut at least you will have no leisure for vulgarity. Tomorrow I will take you to a place that will attempt to feed your vanity until you mistake it for pride. If you do not vomit, I will make you write a poem about your cowardice.\u201d\n\nThe place was a mirror-shop disguised as an art gallery disguised as a charity. Rue Bonaparte has several. It specialized in frames so sincere you could forgive them their glass. The owner, a man with hair that had decided to be a doctrine and a mouth trained to say words like discourse and community without choking, greeted us at the door with the unctuousness of kindness paid by the hour. Mirrors obey men like that because they are bored. The ash-sister walked through the room as if she were a clean knife moving through a drawer full of filthy spoons. People pivoted on her without knowing they had done it, and their reflections tried to keep up and suffered injuries about the eyes.\n\nWe were to stand before a particular glass and be told who we were until our spines learned to choose. The mirror gave me a version of myself with a strip of winter tied around the forehead, the set of a mouth that has been informed and considers itself noble for surviving the news. It offered me a reputation. It would have been useful. It would have opened doors in cities that do not care to pay with hunger. I put my left hand behind my back because I am vain and did not trust it not to offer me a dead whose posture would suit the story. I put my right in my pocket and held Henri\u2019s stitched leather because it pricks if you attempt foolishness. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. The mirror tried to bargain. \u201cLess,\u201d I corrected, because that is what pride says when vanity wants a banquet. I looked what I am, which is a woman built like an intention and a hinge built like a woman. The ash-sister\u2019s head tipped into the smallest of acknowledgements. \u201cYou will do,\u201d she said, as if hiring a chair.\n\nWe took our practice out into the street because if you cannot do it under sky you are pretending for a wall. The city was in one of its moods where it wears coincidence like perfume. Estelle found a man practicing a proposal to the ghost of a fianc\u00e9 he had misplaced and set his hands where they could not lie. Dryden discovered that a shop window had made a habit of believing itself water and taught it to like the accuracy. I ran into a door that would not forgive me for yesterday.\n\nIt was not the same door. It was the kind of door that cousins its grievances. Brass more offended, wood less honest. It had learned to bleed better. It bled at me as a hobby. The ash-sister admired its form. \u201cYou could pay with pride here,\u201d she said, knowing the letter in my dress had decided the invoice was past due. \u201cTell it that it is doing its job and that its job is enough. Tell it to be satisfied with the exact shape of its function. Tell it it need not be dramatic to be essential. Tell it the soup is work.\u201d I hate that kind of speech. It is grandmothers and graves and the good priest a city always keeps in a pocket in case it wants to pretend it did not mean it. I put my hand on the wood. It flinched the way people do when compliments hit a bruise and are therefore accurate. \u201cSufficient,\u201d I said, and my mouth had to set itself into the sort of line that ruins photographs. \u201cYou are sufficient. You do not have to bleed for people to respect how you keep them from the teeth and from the weather. You are allowed not to show us your effort.\u201d\n\nThe door hated me immediately. That is how you know the truth has been useful. It tightened its joints and took satisfaction like medicine. The bleeding stopped because I had refused to admire it. The ash-sister made a noise like a man at an opera when the aria chooses not to be beautiful and is therefore the exact sound of a heart that is not lying. \u201cPaid,\u201d she said, and if she had been anyone else, she would have kissed me on the forehead and been punched for it. Pride ticked once under my sternum and complained and then made itself a bed.\n\nI went to Val\u00e9rian because a hinge that does not get to turn learns to make a door out of a man, and it is not a good habit but it is at least an honest one. He had written a small equation on the air with the tip of a screwdriver and was attempting to see whether watches could understand sentiment expressed in algebra. \u201cThey cannot,\u201d he said when I told him I had given a door enough and not more, \u201cbut they can be taught to like it when you pretend otherwise.\u201d The freckle at 4:08 was slightly wicked and I did not ask why. He poured tea and we stood close enough that if anyone had walked in without the benefit of living in a city that has learned to be extra polite about love, they would have blushed and bought a clock to apologize for intruding. He showed me a spring that had forgiven a wound by learning to be uglier and being grateful. He called it art. I permitted it the word.\n\nThe Br\u00e8che took us to the catacombs that night because bones are still the best auditors. They are polite more often than you would expect. They taught me the difference between kneeling and bending. \u201cYou bend all the time,\u201d said the lightning-cracked skull in its patient voice. \u201cYou call it being good at your work. Kneeling is an accounting. It is when you admit what has leverage over you and allow it.\u201d I do not kneel well. I do not kneel in front of teachers who admire the algebra of their kindness. The ash-sister left us there and went to flirt with a vein of quartz through a wall, which is how she prays. Estelle set her varnished, practised hands on a stack of femurs and asked them their opinion about doors bleeding and I loved her for the question. Dryden said hold to a grave and learned the grave\u2019s idea of later. I told the skulls I had paid pride, and they said only, \u201cTry not to make a habit of it. Pride, like wine, belongs to a particular hour and a particular hunger.\u201d\n\nWhen we came up, the city had rearranged its furniture. There were men in the street wearing respectability like a glove and a woman with a braid like a consolation prize and a minute that had been leaning against a wall as if it owned the wall. The ambulance, bored, had gone to find someone else\u2019s sorrow. The door on Rue des Quatre-Vents watched me with the dull fascination of a bruised thing that is wondering whether you will bruise it where its friends cannot see. I walked past and was boring for an entire block. I have never been so proud.\n\nThe next day the auditors returned with their smiles ironed, and the Br\u00e8che went about its business of being judged. We showed them nothing we could pay for with numbers and everything you can only buy with evening. Madame Panse fed them stew that tasted of receipts and told them it was stock and they nodded because you can always sell a man a story if you do it in a bowl. The Ma\u00eetresse cut them a slice of our patience and dared them to chew. The ash-sister made a small profit on their boredom. I stood at the back and practiced stillness until my hinge forgot its hunger for half an hour and I nearly wept with how much of me was left when the appetite slept.\n\nAt twilight I did a thing that was inconvenient and true. I went to the step on Rue Jacob and laid my cheek on its paint. It smelled of new, which is to say it smelled of lies about exhaustion. \u201cDo you keep the name we paid for,\u201d I asked again, and the step answered with a dignity that almost made me arrogant. \u201cI kept it twice,\u201d it said, and the second time I refused to return it.\u201d It was asking for praise. It had earned a little. \u201cSufficient,\u201d I said, and it understood it had been loved.\n\nDryden carried his thirst like a mirror and learned how not to drown in reflections. Estelle held her hands up to the light and permitted them to be called large without flinching. The shell counted wrong with a rhythm that was nearly music and I allowed myself the ugly pleasure of wanting it never to learn the correct tune. The letter with its pale seal lay breathwarm and quiet against my ribs. The figure-eight it wore in its lip tarnished just enough to be less precious and therefore more trustworthy. Pride paid down a portion of the debt that riches seldom admit to owing. I slept the way carpenters sleep the night after deciding to leave a flaw where it can be seen.\n\nThe morning brought a small ugliness that looked beautiful as it passed. A woman with a scarf the color of reasons threw herself at the prefecture\u2019s counter and gave away three names in quick succession because she believed that if she outran herself the city would lose interest in her sadness. The clerk with the tidy cruelty asked her for a minute and she offered 4:08 and I went cold all in one piece. Val\u00e9rian was standing in the square at that moment eating a pear as if pears were a way to take his grief\u2019s blood pressure. The freckle on his mouth turned its face towards mine as if it had its own eyes. I did not turn. Later is very expensive, but so is beauty. I chose the bill I could pay with the coins left in the purse.\n\nWe are not always permitted a flourish when we are good. Sometimes the city pretends not to notice a hinge that refuses elegance. I walked my line as if it were a sentence that only makes sense if read with the correct breath. The ash-sister watched from a shadow that had decided to say my name at dawn. She nodded once, the way a woman nods at a student who has done something unspectacularly correct. She will charge me interest for that nod; she keeps accounts of her small mercies. I rehearsed standing still in doorways until the door learned I did not intend to amuse it. I grew stiff and unadmired and indispensable, which is a profession.\n\nThat evening the Br\u00e8che pulled water through itself like a thread and set us down near the sea again, not because it loves to watch us drown, but because the tide is the best teacher of not turning when turning is all there is. Ma\u00eetre Sel taught us to plant our feet on a wet plank and let a wave find us without giving our weight to it. \u201cYou are not a river,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are the chin on which it breaks.\u201d Dryden adapted and then forgave himself for doing it badly. Estelle laughed out loud when a wave surrendered its pride and went around her on all fours. I stood stubborn and was ugly and was delighted by my discourtesy.\n\nWhen I returned to my shelf, the door titled The Minute You Would Not Pay glowed faintly with a pleasure it had not been promised. I did not open it. There are whole kinds of love that are merely skill at choosing not to do something. I pressed my palm to it and whispered the word sufficient as if it were a pet name I was teaching my mouth to like. The shell on my pillow counted eight, stopped, counted nothing, which is its own kind of number, and I slept as if I had been allowed to owe nothing for one breath. In the morning there was a moth on my cheek that had been edited out of several ugly moments and had found in me a paragraph that would permit it to live. It dropped a sliver of paper that had no seal and no emblem and only one phrase written in the hand I will always know. Hold your line, it said. The dot at the end was not a dot. It was a freckle. It sat at 4:08 and made me want to be elegant. I put it under my tongue and kept my mouth closed until want learned, briefly, to be still.",
