     "novel_text": "In the last hour before sunrise, Riyadh holds its breath. The tall glass spines of the financial district dim to ink, and the ancient wind from the dunes slips between new towers and old courtyards like a whisper no one can quite catch. On the roof of a whitewashed villa rimmed with bougainvillea, a woman in a pale gray abaya leapt the gap between two buildings with a soft thump that did not wake the sleeping lights below.\n\nShe rolled, rose, and laughed under her breath. The city\u2019s dawn was a ribbon of violet, and the muezzin\u2019s first syllable pressed the sky like a thumb to silk. Layla bint Saad had slept four hours and would not sleep again for sixteen. It was not a complaint. It wasn\u2019t even unusual. As a girl she had peeled figs with her nails and undone locks with clips; as a student she had traced calligraphy for hours until her wrist trembled; as a princess she had learned that teeth are better bared in smiles until bite is needed. These things were all part of the same\u2014what had she called it to her sisters? That set of skills she had practiced in secret while the palace believed she collected perfumes and poetry. \u201cParticular,\u201d she had said then. \u201cPartcilar,\u201d Saffiyah had echoed as a tease, making herself small in the closet while Layla practiced picking a combination safe with her eyes closed.\n\nShe was, after all, the kind of princess who kept maps of air vents folded in the drawer where jewels might wait. The kind who could slip in and out of a building as neatly as writing her name.\n\nShe crouched at the roof\u2019s edge, balancing on the balls of her feet, and blinked down into the alley. The last of the stray cats had slunk off, and a dust-cart trundled past like it had always been a trundler\u2014never fast, never slow. Across the street, in the courtyard where fig trees drooped over a string hammock, a housekeeper hung socks on a line with wooden clips. Layla could smell coffee somewhere. She was bored of screens and excited by problems. That was her trouble.\n\nFootfalls creaked on the stair behind her. She did not turn until she had counted three steps and knew by the weight of the sound that it was her. Hessa, her aunt, Hessa of the folded arms and the watchful eyes.\n\n\u201cYour Highness,\u201d Hessa said, barely suppressing the smile the name always coaxed. \u201cYou are going to break my heart with your madness.\u201d\n\nLayla wiped a smear of grit off her cheek with the back of her hand. \u201cAuntie, you forget. Highnesses descend staircases; I prefer roofs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen marry a roof,\u201d Hessa snorted, and her perfume\u2014green fig and something like new paper\u2014drifted up with the pre-dawn breeze. \u201cIt will be faithful to you. Go pray before you do another stupid thing. The cars will be here in an hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Pavilion starts at nine, yes,\u201d Layla said, vaulting down to the terrace with a neat grace that made the guards on the next roof exchange glances they thought she did not see. \u201cI want to check the maintenance logs before the ministers arrive.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to climb into ducts,\u201d Hessa said. \u201cYour father asked me to remind you what time it is, Layla.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the hour in which the desert listens,\u201d Layla said, and for once Hessa did not roll her eyes. Half the time Layla\u2019s poetry was a shield. But this morning she felt it like a weight on her ribs\u2014cool and pleasant and necessary.\n\nShe made her wudu and prayed. The tiled floor was cool under her forehead. The first slice of light illuminated the calligraphy carved above the arch: God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. She rose with the amen quiet in her mouth like a mint.\n\nAt breakfast the palace was soft with the sound of plates and the sand hiss in the garden as the irrigation flickered on. Saffiyah sat cross-legged on the cushion with a bowl of olives and jam, nimble-fingered as ever, peeling the skin off a single grape like an old woman searching a thread. Yara\u2014bodyguard, driver, the world\u2019s gentlest liar\u2014stood behind Layla\u2019s chair like a shadow that had decided to be helpful. On the far wall the screens murmured headlines to no one, cycling through currencies and weather maps and an upbeat feature about a turtle rescue near Jeddah.\n\n\u201cDid you see the guest list?\u201d Saffiyah asked, plunking the tiny naked grape on a cracker as if it were a jewel in a crown. \u201cI know you did. I\u2019m asking because I want to gossip in front of Auntie Hessa, who hates gossip.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not hate gossip,\u201d Hessa said, buttering bread. \u201cI hate slander. Gossip is an art that should be practiced with skill and restraint.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a desalination plant that runs on sun and math,\u201d Layla said, still smiling. \u201cAnd you want to discuss\u2026?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe foreign princess,\u201d Saffiyah said, widening her eyes as if invoking a ghost. \u201cPrincess Mira\u2026 something. Myr? Like the scent? Mirae? I saw her on a yacht in Greece last summer\u2014on a screen, I mean\u2014and she had a dog in a hat. Two hats, actually. The dog, I mean. Both heads.\u201d\n\n\u201cA mutt with a double brain,\u201d Yara murmured.\n\n\u201cMireille,\u201d Hessa said. \u201cMireille of Avalora.\u201d She made the name sound like porcelain. \u201cHer family invests in packaging. This is what is said.\u201d\n\n\u201cPackaging,\u201d Saffiyah said cheerfully. \u201cBoxes for boxes. She does not recycle. That is what is also said.\u201d\n\nLayla chewed her bread slowly. \u201cNobody recycles perfectly,\u201d she said, hearing in her own voice the cautious tone she used when slowing a car on black ice. \u201cIt is a hard thing to do well. Systems are complicated. People break rules because rules break them first.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe once threw a bag of mixed trash on a beach and told her assistant to blame the locals,\u201d Saffiyah said, undeterred. \u201cA friend of a friend saw. I\u2019m not pretending everyone is a saint. I\u2019m just saying\u2014be careful. She is beautiful like a wineglass, and sharp like the same.\u201d\n\nLayla\u2019s phone vibrated twice. She glanced. Tariq\u2019s name blinked on the screen with its little lightning bolt emoji because he always arrived like weather. She let herself grin and then pressed the smile back down. \u201cI will be careful,\u201d she said to Hessa as if that settled everything. \u201cAnd I want to check the Pavilion\u2019s waste sorting before anyone touches it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course you do,\u201d Hessa said. \u201cWear something with pockets.\u201d\n\nThe Desert Bloom Pavilion rose like a mirage out of the glass and white stone of the King Abdullah Financial District, all honeycomb shade and sloping desert grasses that had not seen rain in a decade but were green anyway. Solar wings unfurled like a hawk\u2019s, and beneath them the air hummed. In the pool at the entrance, a silver sculpture of an oryx stood with its horn tipped to the sunlight in a way that made every camera phone wish for it.\n\nLayla walked with purpose between the columns. Her abaya today was dove gray with a quiet hexagon pattern that echoed the Pavilion\u2019s honeycomb. The two ministers at her side talked in parabolic sentences that bounced off the ceiling and returned to them unchanged. She nodded when needed, smiled when needed, and when the three of them reached the service corridor, she excused herself with a small bow to the men and to the camera clicking behind them and slipped left.\n\n\u201cBoss,\u201d Tariq said, popping up from a crouch beneath a panel he had no business being inside. He wore a t-shirt that said GREEN INK in smeared letters and had a smear of actual green on his cheek as if the shirt had fought back. He looked like a man who had slept under a desk and loved it. \u201cCongratulations on inventing the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not invent it,\u201d Layla said, kneeling to peer into the panel with him. \u201cI just herded six hundred people until they moved in the same direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is the same thing,\u201d Tariq said. His eyes shone. He handed her a small device shaped like a coin. \u201cWe found this stuck to the feed line.\u201d\n\nLayla held it delicately between her fingers. A transmitter, flat. Not uncommon, but unusual here. She turned it over. \u201cPower?\u201d\n\n\u201cBattery,\u201d Tariq said, tapping a schematic on his tablet with a stylus held in a ringed hand. \u201cEncrypted. Probably just data scraping. It\u2019s listening.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo what?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo everything,\u201d he said, trying not to enjoy the drama too much and therefore enjoying it twice as much. \u201cPressure, output, the time you take between blinks, everything. It might be benign. It might be the new normal\u2014everything listening, everything telling secrets to something with a server farm in a far country.\u201d\n\n\u201cFind the rest,\u201d Layla said. \u201cGo soft-foot. And keep my name out of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want me to ghost the minister and mention it in passing?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon't mention it,\u201d she said, and smiled at the way his shoulders loosened at the permission to be clever without witnesses. \u201cNot yet. What\u2019s the waste sort?\u201d\n\nTariq grinned as if she had asked him about a dog that did tricks. \u201cWe have optical scanners, as you ordered, and we taught them to fall in love with PET like it\u2019s a romance novel. The gray water is cycling. The compost worms are sleepy but willing. There\u2019s a kink at the step where people dump their tray. They need to be taught twice. It\u2019s always two. First, the polite sign. Second, the gentle human hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll provide the hand,\u201d Layla said, sliding the transmitter into a pocket she had sewn into the abaya herself, right above the lining where it would sit quiet and not click against anything. It made her feel twelve and triumphant to have a pocket no one else knew about.\n\nBack in the main hall, the sound had sharpened. A dozen staff rehearsed their routines in the multipurpose lobby: where to stand, how to smile, when to sweep away a glass without announcing the act. A musician tuned a oud, and the notes curved back into the metal bones of the building like swallows circling home. The screens above the circular dais cycled through clean data: the rate at which light sketched water out of brine, the CO2 offset with numbers big enough to make ministers clap. Layla loved it. She loved it so much her throat ached.\n\n\u201cYou are early, Amira,\u201d Basim the journalist said, stepping into her shadow as if it belonged to him. He had a camera that weighed too much and a grin that weighed nothing. She tolerated Basim because he never used her title when recording interviews, only in private, and because he had an eye for the kind of photograph that made people tear up in airplanes.\n\n\u201cI live here,\u201d she said. \u201cShall I give you a tour you will pretend to have discovered yourself?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have ink on your face,\u201d he said, deadpan.\n\nShe wiped nothing and looked at him until he laughed. \u201cThe foreign royals land in twenty. You know she is coming,\u201d he said, little brother voice. \u201cMireille. Your friend who loves trash. Rumor says she will throw a bottle under your nose and smile at you. Rumor says this is what she does. Provokes.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is not my friend,\u201d Layla said, more to the air than to him. \u201cAnd if she throws a bottle, we will make a lesson on the spot.\u201d\n\nBasim\u2019s grin curled in appreciation. \u201cAh, a performance. Riyadh will trend for the right reasons again. I adore you for this, Layla.\u201d\n\nShe handed him a badge, because Basim liked to pretend he snuck into everything but actually craved order like a cat craved sun patches. \u201cTrend me gently, Basim.\u201d\n\nThe limousine procession snaked in at nine, and plants in the atrium rustled to see if they would be photographed. Layla stood at the foot of the dais and shook seven hands that had gripped seven different kinds of power. Ministers, investors, young students with eyes like sparklers. She smiled for each one, and the smile was not fake. It was a strategy that had become honest through practice.\n\nThree seconds of hush before the next wave and then the foreign princess arrived.\n\nMireille of Avalora didn\u2019t so much walk as proceed. She wore white without apology and had the posture of a swan that had won a lawsuit. Her hair was a perfect compromise between easy and engineered. The cameras loved her because she offered them angles and a little bite. She did not announce anything except money. Layla saw her hands first. They were slender and idle, and the nails were chaste, no chips. The woman\u2019s gaze slid to Layla, landed, assessed, and stayed. Layla lifted her chin a degree. Suddenly there was a bad taste on her tongue that had nothing to do with coffee.\n\n\u201cYour Kingdom is kind,\u201d Mireille said. Her voice was a bell that had been iced. \u201cAnd very modern.\u201d\n\n\u201cKindness and modernity are not enemies,\u201d Layla said. \u201cWelcome.\u201d\n\nMireille\u2019s gaze flicked over the solar wings, then to the composting garden in its neat glass case, the rows of white trays with color-coded slots. \u201cVery tidy,\u201d Mireille said, and took the water bottle offered by her aide. She drank the whole thing in four dainty swallows, tilted her head, then let the empty bottle dangle in one hand like a chandelier. The cameras leaned in, hungry.\n\n\u201cRecycle, please,\u201d Layla said, and pointed to the slot with the PET icon and the little goat eating a tin can with a red slash over it, an illustration Tariq had insisted would charm the merciless. \u201cBlue.\u201d\n\nMireille blinked. The corner of her mouth ticked.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d she said, helplessly. \u201cI never remember.\u201d\n\nHer aide reached for the bottle. \u201cGive it,\u201d Layla said\u2014lightly. One syllable that drew a small circle around the aide\u2019s wrist. The aide froze, then handed the bottle to the princess it belonged to.\n\n\u201cThis is where it goes,\u201d Layla said, not smiling, not scolding. She made the motion for the cameras, for the students standing just beyond the rope, for herself. Blue slot. Clink. Done.\n\nMireille held her gaze for a three-count and then dropped the bottle into the general waste. The room gasped with the intimacy of it, like someone had slapped a lover in public and smiled at the same time. Basim\u2019s camera clicked. Yara\u2019s fingers tightened around nothing. Layla\u2019s teeth found her own cheek and marked it.\n\n\u201cOops,\u201d Mireille said. \u201cI\u2019m sure it ends up in the same place, darling.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Layla said, easy. \u201cIt does not. We built this to make different places.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh? Then I am impressed,\u201d Mireille said lightly, and leaned in. Her perfume was citrus and unblinking. \u201cBut truly, people who don\u2019t have time don\u2019t have time. Busy women with seven meetings? You understand. We must save our attention for\u2026 significant things.\u201d\n\n\u201cWaste is significant,\u201d Layla said. \u201cBecause one day we run out of later.\u201d\n\nMireille\u2019s smile deepened. \u201cI never do,\u201d she said. Then, to the cameras, brighter, the actress stepping into the light: \u201cCongratulations to our hosts! It is good to be in a city that wants to lead.\u201d\n\nSmall change in the air\u2014like a coin flipped over and over to hide which face will be heads. Layla had the oddest impulse to laugh, because how ridiculous, to be in a public game with a woman whose only sin (so far) was the refusal to use a blue slot like a good child. But there was something else under it. A hum. Tariq\u2019s transmitter against her hip felt warmer than metal should. She shifted, and it was only the friction against the lining.\n\nShe walked the party through their paces. Minister this, CEO that, student with a question that made her heart lift because it was so earnest it was brave. All the while the camera\u2019s attention slid to the white swan princess in the white dress whose smile was like pomegranate pith. Mireille did not lift a finger to help anyone sort anything. Once, when a young girl in a lavender hijab hesitated at the organic bin, Mireille took her tray and dumped everything in one motion into the black-lined container labeled WASTE. The girl stared. No one said anything. Layla felt something hot coil under her ribs like a spring.\n\nAt noon, a glitch appeared on the screen. It was so small it would have been nothing if the eyes on the numbers had been dull. But Layla never let her eyes be dull. She saw the line flicker in the water output graph\u2014just a twitch, a little muscle memory of error. It righted itself. Tariq\u2019s text zipped across her screen a breath later: see the tick? She didn\u2019t reply. She smiled at a senator from an island country who smelled like salt and fear.\n\nThe glitch hiccuped again. Then the coffee bar overflowed foam into someone\u2019s handbag with a delighted hush; the barista cursed softly into his beard; the video screen smoothed out the line again. Someone had done something clever. Or something dumb had been given permission to play. Layla knew the feeling too well. It wasn\u2019t sabotage yet. It wasn\u2019t anything except the whisper before. The Pavilion went on. Tours flowed. Filters sang.\n\nShe stole five minutes and a door. In the service corridor she used her grandmother\u2019s hairpin to rake a lock she could have opened with a key if she had asked the right man. She preferred the hairpin today. It gave her secret joy. The panel opened. The belly of the building sighed at her. Warmth and whir of water. She breathed and listened.\n\nUnder her breath she recited the technician\u2019s map she had memorized at three in the morning while Saffiyah snored with astonishing innocence on the sofa beside her. Two pipes meet, turn. The third is the redundancy line. If there is a foreign object. If there is misreporting. If. If. The little coin device in her pocket seemed heavier than its grams.\n\n\u201cAmira?\u201d Yara\u2019s voice behind her, soft as a cushion that had decided to warn. \u201cYou have three minutes. They are gathering for the ribbon.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell Hessa to cut it,\u201d Layla said. \u201cShe likes cutting.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou like knots,\u201d Yara said. She crouched beside her, glanced in as if the tangle of pipes might misbehave at the sight of their faces. \u201cI saw her,\u201d Yara added, and Layla did not have to ask who she meant.\n\n\u201cMireille.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe looks like she bites.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe looks like she doesn\u2019t finish things,\u201d Layla said, and Yara\u2019s huff might have been a laugh if you were feeling generous.\n\nThey closed the panel. Layla returned to the stage where a ribbon shone like a vein. She stood beside a minister whose tie had been chosen by a cousin. Cameras winked. Basim caught her eye over a bouquet, and she tilted her head a fraction, a silent, Not yet. He nodded, and his hand stilled on the shutter.\n\nThe ribbon parted. The cheer rose. The air smelled like metal warmed by sun and oud and joy. The Pavilion exhaled, like a thing that knows it is alive. Layla exhaled with it. The graph did not flicker. Her phone stayed mute.\n\nWhen trouble came, it came sideways.\n\nAt the waste stations, where people lined up to perform their morning\u2019s virtue with their trays and their banana peels and their crumpled napkins, the scanners began to stutter. Blue light meant plastic. Green meant compost. Red meant error. Red began to strobe. Polite signs became not enough. Staff stepped in with the gentle hands she had promised and met the shrug of the very dignified and the smirk of the expensive. Someone took a video; someone captioned it with a joke. The Pavilion\u2019s hashtag morphed a degree into a word that meant a much smaller compliment. It was not a disaster. But Layla had learned that public faith is a thin, thirsty grass, and a boot heel is heavy.\n\nTariq materialized at her elbow, breathless, smelling like adrenaline which smells like pennies. \u201cWe found three more,\u201d he said. \u201cAll in the gray spaces. All listening.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo they talk?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey chirp,\u201d he said. \u201cLike gossiping sparrows. We can jam them, but then we jam ourselves. Better to feed them what we want them to eat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen feed,\u201d Layla said. \u201cGive them a feast of lies. Tell them the compost is made of gold. Tell them we drink the wastewater at brunch.\u201d\n\nHe snorted. \u201cDone. Also\u2026 the source point.\u201d\n\n\u201cShow me,\u201d she said, and he showed her a tag on the code\u2014a tiny flourish in the encryption, something like a signature if you had the arrogance to sign your spywork. It wasn\u2019t a name, exactly. It was an old Avaloran icon for a hawk and a hand.\n\n\u201cMireille,\u201d Basim said, appearing as if he had walked out of the wall. He was not supposed to be in this corridor. He was always where he shouldn\u2019t be. \u201cOr someone who wants us to think Mireille. Will you accuse her? It will be\u2026 delicious.\u201d\n\nLayla closed her eyes for a second and saw white like a gull. She opened them. \u201cNo. Not delicious. Not yet. We do not know. And I won\u2019t make our Pavilion into a theater of petty slaps. We will know first. Then, we will act.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want a villain you can hold in your hands,\u201d Basim said softly. \u201cThat is reasonable. And sometimes a luxury.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are no villains,\u201d Layla said. \u201cOnly people who choose again and again to forget what matters.\u201d She thought of the bottle dropping into the wrong mouth and made herself breathe until it became a story she had watched instead of a thing she had felt.\n\nMireille found her at the end of the day by the garden where the succulent leaves lifted their fat faces to the light like children. The party had thinned; the cameras had wandered off to the luncheon; even Hessa had let herself sit for five minutes on a bench and stare at the sky as if she had never seen blue before. Mireille stood without a shadow, because she had learned long ago how to angle against the sun.\n\n\u201cYour little machines don\u2019t like my friends,\u201d she said, as though they were intimate enough to share secrets. \u201cPoor things. So fussy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey work beautifully,\u201d Layla said. \u201cPeople are complicated. Machines simply mirror.\u201d\n\n\u201cHm,\u201d Mireille said, tasting the sound. \u201cMirrors, yes. That\u2019s why I avoid them.\u201d She leaned in. The citrus of her perfume sharpened to something like rind scraped on metal. \u201cYou do not frighten me,\u201d she said almost too quietly for anything but Layla to hear. \u201cYour city\u2019s tidy story does not frighten me either. I am not a villain in your tale.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not cast you,\u201d Layla said. \u201cYou auditioned.\u201d\n\nMireille laughed\u2014slow, small, amused with something else in it. Then she leaned past Layla and plucked a glossy green leaf off a plant with a casual thumb and forefinger. She let it fall. \u201cGardening is not my art,\u201d she said. \u201cI prefer\u2026 poisons.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you do recycle,\u201d Layla said. \u201cThreats. From a decade ago.\u201d\n\nMireille\u2019s eyes glittered. \u201cDarling,\u201d she said softly. \u201cMy only threat is that I will always have more time than you. So I do not need to sort my trash, or my men, or my enemies. The world does it for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d Layla said, because she could not help herself, \u201cand yet here you are, sorting your words like plastic.\u201d\n\nYara cleared her throat behind Layla with the quiet that meant leave now. Somewhere in the building something whirred twice that should have whirred once. Basim\u2019s camera clicked though he appeared to be photographing a plant. Hessa\u2019s voice rolled down the hall with a mother\u2019s calm that meant someone somewhere should be afraid. The Pavilion inhaled, the city exhaled.\n\nIn the car on the way back to the palace, Layla watched the sky turned to a bruise-blue ahead of dusk. She let her head fall back against the seat. Yara turned the air a degree cooler, then back again, then left it alone because she had been with Layla long enough to know that too much comfort made her itch.\n\n\u201cWhat do we know?\u201d Yara asked.\n\n\u201cThat we are not imagining it,\u201d Layla said. \u201cThat someone is listening. That they want us embarrassed, not broken. Yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the foreign princess who thinks recycling is beneath her?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat she likes theater,\u201d Layla said. \u201cThat she learned long ago that if she makes people feel small they will carry her across puddles. And that she underestimates the weight of one empty bottle when the right hands pick it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhose hands?\u201d Yara asked.\n\n\u201cMine,\u201d Layla said, and felt the pocket\u2019s small coin like a heartbeat.\n\nAt home, the garden had warmed sumac and jasmine until the night smelled like tea. Hessa sat with her shoes off on the steps and a glass of mint water sweating rings on the stone. \u201cWell?\u201d she asked. She did not need a preface.\n\n\u201cIt went,\u201d Layla said. \u201cThe way things go the first day when the world is watching and a flock of little birds pecks at your seeds. We are fine. We will be better. I want to look at vendor lists at nine. Come if you like puzzles. Bring reading glasses.\u201d\n\nHessa grunted. \u201cSaffiyah would make us dinner, but she burned something and cried because the onion made her feel deep emotion like an opera. I ordered.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is my favorite flavor,\u201d Layla said. \u201cDelivered.\u201d\n\nThey ate sitting on the floor because chairs felt like too much. Tariq arrived like weather\u2014with thundercloud hair and sparrow hands and five small devices in a pouch that kept him awake with their almost song. Basim texted pictures that made the Pavilion look like a poem written by an engineer who loved birds. Yara slipped in and out, and no one noticed when she did because that was her super-power.\n\nAfter midnight, the palace fell into the sound a city house makes when all the people inside are sleeping and the pipes are whispering to each other. Layla did not sleep. She sat at her white desk with a desert map and a spreadsheet and the little coin device disassembled into a tidy fan of parts. She touched each piece once with a fingertip as if it were a talisman. One transistor, two. The battery that pretended to be small and wanted to be large. The case that expected to be thrown away after it had betrayed its secret. She looked up the vendor prefix in an old list that was not the official one, because the official one lied. The prefix belonged to a parent company that had three names and a favorite hobby of changing them. She chased it the way a falcon chases a flicker at the edge of its sight. Into a paper company in Nice. Into a paper company in Manama. Into a shell on a shelf in Avalora with a hawk on its crest that smiled when you were not.\n\nHer phone, face down, vibrated. A single message from an unknown number: Good show today. The desert always forgives waste. We should talk. There was a name. M.\n\nLayla set the phone on the desk and considered the letter the way one considers a trap that has baited itself. Then she turned it off and put it in the drawer beside her grandmother\u2019s hairpins.\n\nThe next morning would bring committees, and classes, and the thousand tiny cuts of governance. The next morning would bring apologies disguised as questions. The next morning would bring all the polite little wars that modern cities fight with napkins and logos and metrics.\n\nBefore she turned out the lamp, she walked barefoot to the roof. The stars were a prayer rug. Riyadh\u2019s breath went in and out, in and out. From here, the desert looked like it might be persuaded to become anything. She put her hands on the warm concrete and felt the hum of the building beneath. It hummed back. She could imagine a future in which waste was a story her children did not understand. She could also imagine a woman in white who never said sorry because no one had asked her to mean it.\n\nYara came up with a blanket and didn\u2019t ask if she wanted it. She lay down beside Layla with the ease of a long friendship and looked at the same nothing held everything. \u201cAre you going to fight her?\u201d Yara asked, both curious and resigned to whatever answer would come.\n\n\u201cNot her,\u201d Layla said. \u201cNot a person. A habit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is harder,\u201d Yara said.\n\n\u201cI have a partcilar set of skills,\u201d Layla said, smiling into the dark. \u201cWe will use them on habits.\u201d\n\n\u201cWake me when you need to be pulled out of a stupid plan,\u201d Yara murmured, already half-asleep on the warm concrete.\n\nLayla closed her eyes. The city was all around her, the sound of it like the sea. From somewhere not far off, a stray cat yowled at the moon in a language of complaint that was older than maps. Layla slept like a soldier does, one ear awake, the other dreaming of water turned to light and back again.\n\nIn the morning, there would be another bottle. Another choice. Another tiny hinge on which the door of everything might swing. Her hands itched\u2014not for jewels, not for ribbons\u2014but for locks and circuits and the soft push of persuasion. She would sort the trash that was people\u2019s fear and the trash that was their comfort. She would go to work. And in the far-off rooms of a foreign palace, a woman in white would wake to find that someone had made a list of everything she threw away.Morning arrived with the kind of pale heat that pretends it is soft until you step into it and it puts a hand on the back of your neck. Layla woke before her alarm with the dry knowledge of tasks stacked like plates, each one slightly damp around the edges. She lay still for a moment and let the call to prayer wash through the room, low and steady like a river you couldn\u2019t see but always trusted was there. The ache along her forearms that came from crawling too far under equipment and too fast across roofs was pleasant, a ledger of effort she did not mind paying. When she sat up, the little coin of a transmitter lay on the desk where she had disassembled it, cured into quiet with its secrets temporarily unstrung. She wanted to pick it up again, to spin the battery between finger and thumb like a coin toss, but instead she stood, made wudu, and let the floor cool her forehead while she told God the truth: that patience was a craft she had not yet mastered, and humility a dress she wore only on some days.\n\nHessa appeared at breakfast wrapped in a soft shawl that had once belonged to Layla\u2019s grandmother, the weave too fine for the way Hessa used it to blot her tea cups. \u201cWe start with vendors at nine,\u201d she said without greeting, as if they had already been mid-conversation in her sleep and had simply hit pause. \u201cBring your spreadsheets and your suspicions. I brought new readers because your father refuses to admit his eyes are aging, and I refuse to pretend I can see ants from across the room.\u201d\n\nSaffiyah was a tangle of legs and promises on the floor, building a fortress out of toast. \u201cI am not coming because numbers make my eyelid twitch,\u201d she announced, propping jam jars as battlements. \u201cBut I will bring snacks later, and wisdom of the domestic kind. Also gossip. The foreign princess has a video of a turtle wearing pearls and she is pretending it is about conservation, and I hate her for being charming when she should be scolded.\u201d\n\n\u201cGossip is only a public service when it keeps wolves from our door,\u201d Hessa said, flipping a page in a folder before she buttered anything. \u201cAnd the princess is not a wolf. She is a mirror held at a inconvenient angle. Either way, Layla will not be scolding anyone until she has proof that their hand is in our cupboard.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps I will scold the cupboard,\u201d Layla said, and she smiled more because she liked the way her aunt\u2019s mouth softened when she made a joke than because the joke was good. Yara poured coffee with that small tilt of the wrist that kept it from splashing, a movement so precise it could have been calligraphy. She had not said a word yet, and Layla did not need her to. Presence was sometimes a better tonic than any advice.\n\nAt nine the Pavilion\u2019s procurement list was a paper jungle, and Layla and Hessa walked through it with a machete made of pencils. Tariq patched into a projector with a cable that had died twice this week and been resurrected by his teeth, and the screen lit up with line items that looked identical until your eyes watered. Filters with alphanumeric names like small insults, adapters that could be purchased for eight riyals or eighty depending on which cousin of which company smiled at you, a subcontractor whose logo was a leaf so green it might be poisonous.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d Hessa said, tapping with the blunt end of her pen where a real person might have used the pen point. \u201cThe mesh. Honeycomb pattern as per the design spec, fine. But the supplier is listed as Al-Layyan Materials, and the invoice address routes to\u2026 hm.\u201d Her glasses slid down her nose, and she slid them back up. \u201cTo an office in the Financial District that is a shelf, not a desk.\u201d\n\nTariq zoomed and the screen complied like a dog that adored him. Behind Al-Layyan Materials nested a name in English that made Layla\u2019s scalp prickle: Hand & Hawk Packaging LLC. It sounded like an inside joke told by two men who had never dirtied their nails on a factory floor. Her finger hovered over the trackpad, and she opened the corporate registry with the neat little permissions that came with her citizenship and her titles and the fact that she had long ago made friends with a clerk who liked sugar dates and long lunches. Hand & Hawk\u2019s directors were appointed through a trust in Avalora named for a valley that did not exist on any public map.\n\n\u201cSo they sell boxes and ghosts,\u201d Tariq said, and the way he said it made the room feel like a lighter had been struck under someone\u2019s sleeve.\n\n\u201cIt might be nothing,\u201d Hessa said, using the tone that meant it was something and that they would treat it like nothing until nothing was exhausted. \u201cGlobal firms are global. Packaging is everywhere. But why are we buying mesh from a paper company whose logo is a hawk holding a hand like a prize?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause somewhere we wanted a sweetheart arrangement and the person who wanted it had a cousin who had a friend who had a golf game with a man named Marcel who gave a discount that is not a discount,\u201d Layla said lightly, and then not lightly at all, \u201cor because someone wanted a handle on our pipeline and found it in a tiny part we would not think to guard.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d Yara asked, finally. She stood with her hands behind her back and her chin at the angle that meant she had a plan already and was waiting to see if Layla would need it.\n\n\u201cAftan Hotel,\u201d Layla said, and Tariq made a small noise like joy trying not to spill. \u201cThe Avaloran delegation has taken the east wing with the view. Their security is good because they hire men who can make their muscles look like arguments. The cameras on the service stairs are blind at twelve minutes past every hour because the circuit is old and lazy. We will not use the service stairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will use the laundry shaft because you are a goat,\u201d Hessa muttered, but there was pride in it, too. \u201cI will handle polite things while you handle impolite ones. Basim will hover like a vulture who is also a poet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI prefer kestrel,\u201d Basim said from the door, because of course he had found them. He flicked his badge with his knuckle as if it were a trick coin. \u201cAnd I bring tidings. The bottle incident has been memed into the shape of a parable. Half of Riyadh applauds your patience. Half of Avalora applauds their princess\u2019s refusal to be told where to place anything, including her opinions. It is theater and you have both made excellent costume choices. Also, someone sent me this.\u201d He passed his camera, and on the screen a photo breathed: Mireille at the waste station, bottle poised, Layla pointing, the blue slot like a wound waiting to be healed. It was beautiful and terrible at once, and a small twinge went through Layla\u2019s stomach at the knowledge that sometimes a picture could be kinder than the truth or crueler.\n\n\u201cPost it tomorrow,\u201d Layla said, and Basim blinked. \u201cLet today be about numbers. Tomorrow we give them a story they can chew while we do work in quiet. If we feed them now, they will be noisy in the wrong place.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if the story bites you?\u201d he asked, because his job was to ask the questions that turned your knees into unsteady furniture.\n\n\u201cThen let it,\u201d she said. \u201cMy knees were never for standing on one place anyway.\u201d\n\nThe Aftan Hotel had the best elevators in the city because its architect understood that a good elevator ride was a poem and a bad elevator ride was a sermon. The glass spine gave you the whole city while you rose, and if you had a fear of heights you were wooed out of it by the smoothness of the ascent and the way the light warmed your shoulders through the pane. Yara shadowed Layla in a slate suit that made her look like a favorite difficulty on a chessboard, and they moved like women who had come to look at a view and possibly complain about a carpet. The concierge recognized Layla in the way of people trained to recognize the weight of certain steps and very kindly asked if she needed anything at all.\n\n\u201cA place to sit for ten minutes and a glass of water,\u201d Layla said, and he smiled like being useful had been his only wish and it had finally been granted. The water arrived with slices of lemon that looked relieved to be cold. The ten minutes were for the security feed to show them its habits, and Yara watched the corner screen while Layla pretended to admire a flawed painting of a desert that had never known grit.\n\n\u201cThis is your goat path,\u201d Yara murmured, as two valet boys wheeled a rack of crisp white sheets into the freight corridor and propped the door with their own good intentions. Layla nodded once, slow. She carried no bag; her abaya hid tools in a way the designer would have felt pleased about if he had ever known, which he would not. The hairpin went into her sleeve and made her feel fifteen again in the quiet part of her chest where she filed the ways she had learned herself.\n\nOn the twelfth floor the corridor smelled like restrained money: lilies cut before they scented; carpet deep enough to trap a paperclip forever. The Avaloran placard with its tasteful crest sat beside a door at the far end as if it had been born there. Two men with necks like thumbs stood with their hands crossed over their belts and their gazes crossed over the air. Layla did not consider them. She did not have to walk past them because the hotel\u2019s spine had other ways to carry a stubborn idea where it wanted to go.\n\nThe laundry shaft mouth was square and inviting if you were a person who had flirted with danger enough to make old friends with it. To anyone else it was a blue door that read STAFF ONLY, which was a sign, not a law. Yara listened through the door like a thief in a play, and when she raised two fingers it meant quiet as a prayer mat and twice as firm. They slipped through and slid the lock with a magnet that had been marketed as a toy and had never met Layla before. The shaft rose around them like a throat. The metal grid made a map for your feet if your feet were small and rude. Yara went first because she always made herself the blade that would catch if something fell. Layla followed because she always chose to be the weight afterward that did not crash.\n\nThey reached the east wing outlet by counting bolts. The grate was old and might as well have handed Layla a screwdriver and a mint for how easily it permitted itself to be persuaded. Behind it, a storage room breathed out the faint eucalyptus scent of housekeeping supplies and something else that was colder, like a laptop left open on a bed. Yara slid into the room and took the cold with her hand; Layla slid after and took the eucalyptus with her lungs. They waited until the building sighed again because buildings always sigh between human movements. Only then did they move.\n\nOn the shelf behind a stack of towels folded into humble, obedient squares, a case sat that had no business looking so ordinary. It was black, zipper-mouthed, sturdy without being loud. Layla opened it with the hairpin because the lock wanted a small intimate conversation. Inside lay a device that pretended to be a router and a device that pretended to be an external battery and a device that had stopped pretending and wanted very much to be a mouth. The hawk-and-hand icon sat on the sticker like a wry promise. She ran a finger along the seam where plastic met arrogance and found the place where the arrogance had not sat quite flush.\n\nYara handed her a cord. The laptop that went with it was the kind men who did jobs in shadows buy when they want to feel powerful inside an airport. It hummed awake. It asked for nothing. It did not know it had been seen by someone who saw it from angles to which it was unaccustomed. Layla did not log in because she did not need to. She did not steal; she borrowed truth and left it where the owners could find it themselves later and pretend they had known it all along. She plugged in a mouth that listened to other mouths and began to copy. She thought briefly of fish scales under the sun, the way they flashed all at once and then hid. Data flowed into a wafer balanced in her palm like a sweet.\n\nFootfalls outside were a different weight than the ones in the laundry corridor. A woman in heels. Another woman not in heels, walking like she had always had places to be and never needed to rush to get to them. Layla looked at Yara, who had already killed the laptop\u2019s smile and replaced it with a blank face that showed nothing but the hotel\u2019s reflected ceiling. The conversation outside was French with the cheap vowels of the very rich who had learned it at school from other rich people who wanted to sound like glass. The name Mireille slipped out once, followed by a laugh like a ladle tapping a pot. Layla closed her eyes and counted to five because five was the number you needed to turn an impulse into a plan.\n\nThe voices faded. A door clicked. The cleaning trolley next door complained in a long wheeze about its broken wheel. Yara breathed in and out, frighteningly quiet, then touched Layla\u2019s sleeve twice to say Go. The data finished its slide into Layla\u2019s naghl, the little chip she wore in a ring that people complimented as tasteful without ever suspecting it was hungry. She sealed everything as they had found it, left no hair in any corner, wiped the place where sweat might have betrayed them, and slipped back into the throat of the building like a word swallowed at a dinner table.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until they were in the elevator again that Layla let herself grin. Even then it was a secret, the kind of smile that belongs to a private victory and a very good piece of baklava you didn\u2019t have to share. Yara looked at her without looking because she had watched Layla read a city and read a man and read a lock, and every one of those readings had given her that exact mouth. \u201cYou will not post about this,\u201d Yara said, flat, which was how she said I will kill any public mention before it stands up.\n\n\u201cI will sing about it to the laundry shaft,\u201d Layla said. \u201cIt appreciated our efforts.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou made a new friend,\u201d Yara said dryly. \u201cIt was square and uncomplaining.\u201d\n\nThey did not go straight back to the Pavilion because going straight back anywhere after doing something illicit is a smell, and they had both learned to be wind instead. They stopped at the salvage yard at the edge of the city where old refrigerators fell in love with old bicycles at sunset and never told anyone. The man who ran the yard had a name everyone had forgotten because they had all called him Uncle for twenty years. He waved at Layla with hands that remembered every screw they had ever turned. \u201cMy Amira,\u201d he said without irony. \u201cYou have come to collect something you did not know you needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came to be reminded of how much isn\u2019t trash,\u201d she said, and he snorted, pleased, because he did not like being called a trash man. He liked being called a midwife to second chances. They walked the aisles where history rusted neatly. She let her fingers skim over a radio that had once lived in a tent in the north and a fan that had once comforted a woman through three summers and the end of a marriage. \u201cDid you used to keep a drawer,\u201d she asked, \u201cfor screws that didn\u2019t belong anywhere yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am the drawer,\u201d he said. \u201cMy life is the drawer. The city empties its pockets into my lap and asks me to find the use. You have a face like you want to empty a pocket into my lap and ask me to not ask questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have scrap mesh in a honeycomb pattern?\u201d she said, and his eyebrows did something acrobatic that made Yara cough to hide a laugh. He did. It had come last week in a crate stamped with three different stamps and none of them sure about their own authority. The pattern was slightly wrong compared to the Pavilion\u2019s\u2014just enough to cut someone who thought their hands were safe.\n\n\u201cHow much?\u201d she asked, and he named a number that did not insult her and did not feel like charity. She paid and he folded the mesh into a parcel like it was a gift for a wedding. When he pressed it into her hands, he touched her knuckles with a rough tenderness and said in a voice that carried more memory than air, \u201cYour grandmother used to come here. She would buy old keys and sit in the shade and polish them while she told me which doors they used to open, even if she had never seen the doors.\u201d\n\nLayla tucked the mesh under her arm as if it were a child. She found herself wanting, with sudden ferocity, to see her grandmother\u2019s handwriting again, the way the letters rose and kneaded each other like bread. Some days the line between the women in her family felt like something you could walk with your eyes closed. Other days it was as thin as hair and just as resilient. On either kind of day she was grateful.\n\nBack at the Pavilion, the sun had made the solar wings smug in their efficiency. The screens had recovered their composure and the waste station lights shone with a confidence that made Layla suspicious of their motives. She fed the copied data into Tariq\u2019s careful machines and watched the packets blossom like bacteria on a petri dish. The hawk and the hand flew through the code with a sly small motion, and beneath it a layer of something domestic wriggled.\n\n\u201cThis is ours,\u201d Tariq said, squinting. \u201cNot the icon. The signature under it. Someone fed an Avaloran beast our bread. Look at the time stamps on these handshake requests. Look at the IP range. It looped through a local exchange that we own the dirt under.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho owns the cable that touches the dirt that touches that exchange?\u201d Hessa asked, leaning in so close to the screen her glasses fogged from its warmth. She wiped them on her shawl. \u201cWho, and which cousin in whose office signed the contract that let them write their name in pencil where it should have been carved in stone?\u201d\n\nLayla made the calls she could make without anyone knowing she had made them. The answers came dressed in the coats of the very polite; she took them anyway and left the coats on the backs of chairs. A domestic firm with an international nickname had been brought in to secure the Pavilion\u2019s data because it made investors feel safe to hear that the men guarding their money wore suits and said zero knowledge with confidence. The firm subcontracted the grunt work to a company with a logo that looked good on glass. The subcontractors had bought tools online like clever children handing out cheating devices before an exam. Somewhere in that pipeline, someone with a sense of humor had told a story with a hawk and a hand on it.\n\n\u201cSo she may have nothing to do with it,\u201d Basim said, voicing the sentence that tasted of both relief and disappointment. \u201cThe foreign princess may be a red herring with very good taste in dresses.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr she has everything to do with it and she is so very good at using the hands of other people that we will never see fingerprints,\u201d Hessa said. \u201cYou don\u2019t catch a fish by deciding it must be a goat. You mind what you are holding.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we are holding is a chance to decide what kind of city we are,\u201d Layla said, and the room went still like a library at noon. \u201cDo we snarl and push, do we adopt the manners of those who bet on our faltering, do we let ourselves be made theatrical? Or do we stay boring in public and dangerous in private? I prefer the second. It is more effective and more satisfying to my petty heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour heart is not petty,\u201d Yara said, and the tone in her voice made Layla\u2019s throat go tight for a moment, as if something had blossomed there too quickly. \u201cYour heart knows how to weigh stones.\u201d\n\nThe message from Mireille came late afternoon, a crisp invitation delivered by email and paper both because her people understood that some audiences liked one or the other and some liked to refuse both. It asked Layla to a private salon at the Aftan that evening, no cameras, no agenda, only mutual admiration of sunlight turned into water. It was signed with a flourish that looked like a spilled thread of pearl.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t go,\u201d Layla said, not looking at anyone as she read it again. \u201cOr I will go and bring a recorder and a small bomb, and since both options are rude, we will do neither. I will invite her to us. To the stables outside Wadi Hanifa where the falconers train on Thursdays. If she was going to dress her icon in a bird she can at least be asked to hold one.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are going to make her carry a living thing she can\u2019t drop in the wrong bin,\u201d Saffiyah crowed from the doorway, having drifted in with the timing of a theatre sprite. \u201cThis is an act of genius, and I will come to watch and cry with deep emotion like the onion made me.\u201d She flopped onto a chair and kicked it with a heel until it stopped wobbling. \u201cBy the way, I signed us up for a community panel with the girls from the university tomorrow. They want to shout for you and make friendship bracelets and discuss policies like they are embroidery patterns. It will be chaos. You will love it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will love it,\u201d Layla said, looking at her sister with the kind of gratitude that did not always find words. \u201cAlso, I bought us mesh.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did what?\u201d\n\nLayla took them down to the maintenance belly and showed them the parcel like she had adopted a stray cat. Tariq grinned as if she had brought him a new punctuation mark. \u201cWe will swap one panel in a place no one thinks to look,\u201d he said before she spoke it. \u201cWe will tag the panel like it is a fish. We will watch who tries to bite; we will learn where the bite comes from; we will see which line goes taut.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not entirely legal,\u201d Hessa observed, and no one dignified that with more than a glance because the legality of anything depended on whether the law had been designed to punish exactly the kinds of men who did not imagine anyone would ever do what they did to them.\n\nDusk came down dressed like a pomegranate peel, a little red, a little rough, promising sweetness if you wanted to work for it. The falconers met Layla at the edge of the wadi where the palm shadows tilted and then straightened themselves like men adjusting their cuffs. The birds looked like carved questions on their perches, eyes hooded, feathers polished by air. The head falconer, a man with a manner like a dry well that didn\u2019t show you its depth, bowed to Layla and then let his gaze rest on Mireille with the experienced indifference of someone who had seen many people try to look important in front of something that did not care.\n\nMireille came in white again because a brand is a small god and must be fed. She looked out of place and was not. People who had been rich for a long time knew how to make place shift to accommodate them rather than the other way round. She did not smile too soon. When the hood came off the first falcon and the bird\u2019s eye presented its clean thought to the evening, Mireille did an odd thing. She forgot to be clever. Her face emptied of tactic and filled with wonder because no one renders you more honest than a creature that has no patience for your shape of lying. She held out a hand without thinking, and even Layla wanted to take back her suspicion for one second and let it fall into the sand like a coin that had done its job.\n\nThe bird hopped to her glove with the insolent delicacy of a creature who knows you will not drop it. Mireille\u2019s shoulders softened. She looked down in a way that made the lines around her mouth relax into a different woman. \u201cHe is very light,\u201d she said in accented Arabic, and Layla almost smiled because the grammar was wrong but the sentiment was right. \u201cHe is very light, and I am heavier than I look.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of us are,\u201d Layla said. \u201cHe is light because he is all function. No hoarding. Only muscle that is used and bone that is needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is why you like him,\u201d Mireille said, glancing up as if they were sharing a joke that had merits in both languages. \u201cYou believe in function.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe in grace,\u201d Layla said, and the falconer made a sound that might have been approval, which in his language was a poem.\n\nThey let Mireille fly the bird and bring him back, and Layla watched the way she watched. There were people who watched so they could own the thing they were watching with a story later. There were people who watched because watching is a kind of prayer. Mireille, to Layla\u2019s surprise, watched like a woman who occasionally forgot to perform and remembered what it felt like to be a person. The hood went back on. The bird\u2019s world went dark in the kind way, not the cruel kind. Mireille\u2019s smile was small and private when she handed him back.\n\n\u201cYou invited me to educate me,\u201d she said later, standing with her heel sinking into the sand like a small truth. \u201cWhich is charming in an arrogant way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI invited you because if you are going to throw symbols around, you should meet at least one living thing they stand in for,\u201d Layla said. \u201cAnd because I liked your message. It was written like a woman who gets what she wants by pretending what she wants is what you want.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said no,\u201d Mireille observed, something like good humor shading the syllables.\n\n\u201cI said later,\u201d Layla corrected. \u201cLater is a word with many rooms.\u201d She waited. Mireille did not fill the quiet with an offer. That was telling. People who controlled rooms did not often tolerate quiet.\n\n\u201cYou think I am picking at you because it pleases me to be contrary,\u201d Mireille said finally, more to the sky than to Layla. \u201cAnd sometimes I am. It is a sport. But also\u2014pay attention\u2014I am showing you what the world will do when it is bored of your virtue and wants something messy to bite. Your tidy story will be challenged. Your graphs will tremble. Your supporters will become bored and will want meat. You will have to decide how to feed them without choking yourself.\u201d She looked at Layla then, and this time her expression had no lace on it. \u201cI do not recycle because I am lazy, yes. But also because I live in a place that has decided gently not to bother me. You live in a place that is deciding to bother itself. You are making your country an inconvenience. I admire it. And I will make it harder for you because that is what everything does. If you survive me you will survive the day after I am gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour foreword to my memoir is drafted, thank you,\u201d Layla said, dry as the ground they stood on. \u201cNow stop throwing bottles where I can see you. You can keep not sorting your trash in your private life as a hobby, but not in my house. My mother raised me to be a polite host, and my aunt will murder you with a butter knife if you embarrass her catering staff again.\u201d\n\nMireille laughed then like a burst of grapefruit and slid her sunglasses on though the sun was almost gone. \u201cI look forward to our little wars,\u201d she said, and the falconer who had never looked forward to any war in his life fed his bird with his back turned because he disliked watching people make metaphors near animals too clean to deserve them.\n\nNight carried them back into the city with the kind of velvet that makes you forget knives exist. The data Tariq had copied unfolded into a map they could use. They tracked handshake requests to a server room in a building three blocks from the Pavilion, a building with a logo that told you nothing except that someone had money. Basement, back corner, locked twice for show and once properly. The guard on the night shift had a radio that did not work and a book he pretended not to be reading. Layla imagined the long hallway where the cords hung like sleeping snakes and felt that old electric hunger in her hands. It would be so easy to go now, to write a story in the cables and leave with half the answer she needed. It would be easy, and that made it exactly the wrong moment.\n\n\u201cWe will wait,\u201d she told Yara, who had already opened the glove box where an illegal key card slept like a chocolate no one was supposed to eat. \u201cWe will make them comfortable. Tariq will feed them patterns in their sleep. We will ask the building for its gossip. We will pretend to be busy with ribbon cuttings and university panels. Then we will step into their pantry and steal back our spices.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will step,\u201d Yara said. \u201cI will throw you if you hesitate.\u201d\n\n\u201cNoted,\u201d Layla said, and smiled into the traffic, which glowed with the promise that people everywhere were doing small stupid brave things and trying to get home.\n\nThe university panel sprawled over the next afternoon like a picnic with an agenda. Girls with notebooks and glitter eyeliner asked questions with both hands; professors attempted to herd discussion into squares and failed in ways that delighted Layla; an earnest young man in a vest gave a speech about individual choice that made Hessa\u2019s eyebrow raise incrementally until it threatened to detach. Layla told them the truth about systems without removing the shine from their individual agency, which was a magic trick that left her throat sore. She did, inevitably, demonstrate the waste station herself because the optics were divine and because repetition is the mother of competence. When a girl with a shaky voice confessed that her father refused to recycle because the neighbors didn\u2019t and it made him feel foolish to be alone, Layla said they would send the father a letter of gratitude signed by a minister and a schoolchild and a goalkeeper. The room laughed, and the girl cried in a way that was not dramatic but did feel like a small dam had been asked to be a river for a minute.\n\nAfterwards, in the hallway, Basim handed her a print of the waste station photograph. He had done something with the light that made it kinder. \u201cIs this the one you want?\u201d he asked, and his voice was not the voice he used for work. \u201cOr do you want the one where your jaw looks like you are about to bite her?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis one,\u201d she said. \u201cThe city is a better place when I swallow and chew later.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have become politician enough to give me mottos,\u201d he teased, but there was affection in it like a soft scarf thrown over your shoulders whether you wanted it or not. \u201cSend me a note when you plan something stupid so I can make pictures that look like you meant it.\u201d\n\nThe message from the unknown number came again that night, this time with a link that wanted to be clicked in the way a snake wants to be stroked. It promised a list of \u201cfriendly vendors\u201d who might relieve the Pavilion of the burden of having to do everything itself. It signed itself M again and added a heart as if that made the letter less arrogant. Layla stared at it long enough that the phone turned its face off of its own accord and sulked. She took the hairpin out of the drawer and turned it in her fingers until the metal warmed. Then she put it back and called a woman in a tiny office in a gray building on the edge of the city, a woman who filed import documents like she was composing a symphony and who had once saved Layla from a fine by knowing a thing about beet sugar that no one else remembered at the right moment.\n\n\u201cI need to know who stamped a crate marked disposable telecommunications equipment with a hawk,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I need to know if the stamp belongs to anyone whose name I can say out loud without making enemies whose houses I have to visit at Eid.\u201d\n\nThe woman hummed like a refrigerator and said she would call back tomorrow if God allowed. Layla thanked her and hung up and wished there was a hobby that did not require patience. She walked to the roof because roofs were honest. Yara followed with two cups of tea that steamed like weather. The city glowed and murmured and forgave nothing. It was rude and beautiful and very awake. It was the place that had made Layla into something that could climb and apologize in the same breath.\n\n\u201cYou were kinder to her today than you needed to be,\u201d Yara said after they had both finished half their cups and the silence had settled into something comfortable. \u201cAt the falcons.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am always kinder than I need to be until there is teeth,\u201d Layla said. \u201cEveryone else has teeth. They enjoy biting. I prefer to press. When you press the right places on the right days, you make something that looks like a miracle and is just leverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want me to stand in a different place in the room when she is near you?\u201d Yara asked. \u201cBecause I stood two steps away today and I can stand one if you want to feel my breath on your neck and remember to be careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Layla said softly, because two steps had felt like trust and she did not want to trade that for the kind of security that made you sad later without knowing why. \u201cTwo steps is right. It lets me see you and not need you, which is a luxury I like.\u201d\n\nThey sat until the tea was cold and the rumor of a cat fight rose and fell in the alley like a tiny war lost and won. Somewhere, the city\u2019s newest desalination unit purred and ticked and gave a glass of water to a woman who had forgotten to buy any and now would not have to. Somewhere else, a man who had never thought about waste did a small right thing because a sign had been drawn charmingly enough that he believed it had been written just for him. Layla held these like coins in the back of her mouth and let them make her speech richer with their wanting.\n\nIn the morning, the woman from the gray building called. Her voice was triumphant and exhausted, the way joy often is when it has been earned. \u201cIt is a private security stamp, not a customs stamp,\u201d she said. \u201cIt belongs to a firm that was given three contracts last quarter to \u2018harden vulnerable flows\u2019 at public sites. Someone repurposed the marking procedure for their own inventory to mark yours without asking. The signature under the signature is domestic. You will not say the name because you like to keep your leads longer than two days.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not say the name,\u201d Layla agreed, and wrote it down anyway because writing names down was a ritual that made them less slippery. The name was familiar. It belonged to a man who smiled beautifully and never wore the same watch twice and who had told Layla at a luncheon that he admired her because she had made the word sustainability sound sexy. She had wanted then to put his tongue in a drawer and ask him to write the word ten times until he cried.\n\nShe made a list. It counted like a prayer. Call the minister and ask him why menace is easier to purchase than maintenance. Visit the basement with the friendly guard when the building had hiccuped itself to sleep. Replace the honeycomb mesh and set the hook; see what bit. Write a letter with Saffiyah to the father who did not want to be the only recycler on his street. Feed the cameras something wholesome while they swiveled in search of blood. Ask Mireille to do one hard thing in public and hold her to it with a velvet rope.\n\nShe put the list in her pocket. It sat above the seam she had sewn herself, a small secret space that made her feel thirteen and invincible. Then she went to work, not the kind of work people photograph but the kind that turns a country into itself by repetition and the faint stubborn joy of small corrections. Riyadh rose and threw its light on her hands and all the hands around her. The desert listened. The city did not hold its breath; it exhaled, and the air moved where she needed it to go. She let herself think, for a flicker, of a woman abroad waking to find a courier at her door with a package wrapped in brown paper and two words on a card: Sort this. Then she put that away and turned to the nearest knot, which was not a villain but a habit dressed in a logo, and she began to untie it.By late morning the Pavilion had settled into the rhythm of a space that knew exactly how much it could give without taking damage. Pipes ticked behind walls like discreet metronomes keeping promises; the waste stations blinked blue-green-blue with the patience of teachers who had been warned the class would arrive late and wired. Layla walked its spine with Hessa three paces behind, Tariq orbiting with a tablet under his chin as if the numbers might drip away if he didn\u2019t hold them close. They were not hunting trouble as much as laying a table where trouble might arrive thinking it had been invited. The parcel of salvaged mesh they had bought from the yard sat on a maintenance cart beneath a nest of innocent mop heads and a coil of hose. Tariq had embroidered a thread of aftermarket brilliance along its edge: a wafer-thin sensor that would wake if anyone not listed on their quiet registry tampered with the panel, and a whisper-tag in the solder that would sing to them in a frequency most security equipment ignored because it sounded like an air conditioner about to learn humility.\n\nThey chose the place by committee, the way families choose where to sit at a wedding when one cousin will talk to another only if there is bread between them. The intake vent above the gray-water reclaim was too obvious; the inspection hatch near the compost digesters was too beloved by engineers who prided themselves on noticing what normal people didn\u2019t. They ended up at a knee-high mesh guard on the shaded side of the south wing where no guest had reason to loiter and every contractor stepped without thinking on Thursdays. Layla knelt on the warm concrete, lifted the existing panel with gloved hands, and slid the new one into place with the tenderness of someone putting a sleepy child into a borrowed bed. Tariq fussed with his tools for the sake of anyone watching on the wrong camera, and Hessa repurposed her shawl as shade so the angle of Layla\u2019s shoulder would be less intimate to the lens.\n\n\u201cWhen they come, they will come like men do when they believe the street has always been theirs,\u201d Hessa said, not quite whispering. \u201cThey will step carelessly. They will assume the grate means safety, the way they assume a uniform means lower rank. They will teach us their habits by practicing them.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay their shoes be rubber and their excuses thin,\u201d Tariq murmured, and his grin took the sting off the prayer. \u201cDone. Our fish swims. We wait for a bite.\u201d\n\nWaiting was never a vacuum in Layla\u2019s house; it was an opportunity disguised as a pause. She and Hessa walked from the south wing straight into a majlis where chairs were arranged like chess pieces in the shade, and men whose handshakes might have been currencies if you could carry them in your pocket sat as if heat never touched them. The watch-smiling man was there in a linen suit the color of milk froth, a face like a promise, a timepiece heavy enough to count as an heirloom even if he had bought it last week. His name, on paper, belonged to a respectable father and a school with winter; in rooms like this he wore whatever name pleased his audience. Today he let himself be called Nabil because it suited the vowels around him.\n\n\u201cYou do us honor, Amira,\u201d he said, standing the exact second before she reached him like a man who knew choreography and enjoyed it. \u201cWe were all saying we had not yet seen the new miracle of your Pavilion, and then Rahman reminded us we are only men and should be patient until we have earned a tour.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will always be welcome if your shoes are clean,\u201d Layla said, and his laugh was correct. She made it easy for him because easy made men forget to be careful, and she wanted him uncareful. Hessa sank into a chair that creaked at her as if a grandmother had approved of its choice of company and folded her shawl in a way that turned it into a weapon if conversation required.\n\nThey spoke of water as if it were an acquaintance everyone respected and many abused. Nabil shone in these rooms; he had the talent of offering truisms with enough grace that people took them as gifts instead of as empty plates. \u201cSecurity is the second spine,\u201d he intoned at one point, and several heads nodded because spines were something men allowed themselves to respect even as they hired cheaper hands to bend them. Layla let him talk until her tea cooled from hot to hospitable. Then she asked him, very gently, who had recommended the firm that had stamped a hawk where a seal should have been and why the board\u2019s procurement committee had discovered three layers of subcontractor instead of the one they had approved.\n\nIt was a press, not a bite. She watched him for the wince. He could have chosen any number of exits. He could have feigned ignorance and later sent a bag of dates his assistant would swear had come from his aunt. He could have named a civil servant who could not defend himself because he was in Makkah with his mother. He chose the oldest path: he leaned forward, made his voice five degrees warmer, and said he had done what everyone did. \u201cWe all hire relationships,\u201d he said, careful to not insult while acknowledging he had expected to be untouchable. \u201cThis city runs on trust. Your Pavilion is a jewel; we wanted it guarded by people who value jewels. If someone wrote their names under ours, it is because they hoped your success would polish their own. Let me look. I will straighten the shelf.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is generous,\u201d Layla said, and the word meant exactly what it meant when you offer someone a jug to carry and watch whether they slosh. \u201cWe will look together. Bring your paperwork to the Palace at ten. Bring the cousin who chooses your watches. We will feed you both and see which of you eats with your left hand under the table.\u201d\n\nHe laughed again, this time thinner. Hessa smiled with her mouth and not at all with her eyes. They let him leave thinking he had made a friend of a problem, and perhaps he had, in the way you sometimes befriend a scrupulous neighbor because you cannot avoid borrowing sugar from her when the shops are closed.\n\nBasim\u2019s photograph appeared on a hundred screens after lunch, posted not by him but by students with respectable families and noisy enthusiasm. In it, Layla\u2019s finger pointed and her face was soft enough that the instruction looked like an invitation. The bottle gleamed at the apex of choice as if it had been waiting its whole plastic life to be told where to go. Mireille\u2019s mouth was the same shape people\u2019s mouths take when they first see their reflection after a haircut they commissioned and regret. The avalanche of comments was the kind that makes publicists either earn their salary or quit. Half of the internet practiced manners on strangers; the other half practiced cruelty under the flag of accountability. Saffiyah stood on a sofa and read them aloud until Hessa swatted her with a cushion and told her to feed her mouth with almonds instead of nonsense.\n\n\u201cShall we post a challenge?\u201d Saffiyah asked, mouth full, eyes sinister with glee. \u201cThe Princess Sorting Cup. Children versus CEOs. Winner gets to choose a wildflower garden and a library book order; loser gets to carry compost for a day like it is their handbag.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Layla said, and the word was long, stretching from joke to weapon. \u201cWe will make it a game and a rite. Children will win. The adults will look handsome while losing. People will like them for it. This will build us a little bridge while we are busy under the river, moving stones.\u201d\n\nThe under-the-river work waited until the city had bruised into evening and the Pavilion\u2019s day-shift laughter had been swept into buckets and poured into the mop sinks to dry. The building three blocks away breathed blue light through its ground floor as if it had swallowed an aquarium. Layla wore gray that did not ask to be noticed; Yara wore a jacket that said she belonged anywhere she had chosen. They carried a foil pan of sambusas balanced on a roll of printer paper and an accident in their back pockets. The guard at the desk looked up with a man\u2019s relief at being spared his own boredom and eyed the food like it had never in his life meant anything but love.\n\n\u201cYou look like my cousin,\u201d Layla said, smiling as if this were the best kind of coincidence. \u201cAnd you look hungry. We have a delivery for the basement because someone upstairs thinks people downstairs do not need to eat. Will you prove them wrong and help me do this properly?\u201d\n\nHe puffed a little under the kindness because kindness in city buildings often arrives wearing a clipboard and no patience. He led them, as gently as a man can lead two women who move like trouble that has been domesticated, to a door with two locks and a tired camera. He buzzed it like he was sneaking a cat into a hotel. Inside, the hum settled into their bones. Server rooms are the closest most people get to hearing a whale sing; if you love machines the sound can make your back straighten as if someone had called your name.\n\nThey did not hurry because haste looks like guilt when replayed on slow video. Yara chatted about air filters as if they were gossiping a scandal; Layla set the sambusas on the edge of a rack and apologized to the saints of cleanliness for leaving crumbs in a room where dust is the only religion. The hawk-and-hand sticker they had expected waited on a case bolted to the wall with the neat arrogance of people who think a lock is a suggestion. Tariq\u2019s voice was mild in their ears through a bud that anyone would mistake for a pearl. He narrated the way a fisherman narrates the sea. \u201cTwo devices talking where only one should. One is the building\u2019s; one is the hawk\u2019s. Give me the hawk\u2019s tongue if you can. Scratch it if you cannot.\u201d\n\nLayla looked for a tongue and found a throat. The cable that shouldn\u2019t be there snaked out of the case with the electricity of people caught in the wrong kiss. She slid her tool under the lip of the casing, felt the screw\u2019s thread like a familiar scar, and coaxed it. The room had that particular cold that makes fingers lie about how nimble they are. She scolded hers silently and they obeyed. Yara\u2019s body blocked the camera\u2019s view with the indifference of an employee leaning to read a label. The lid came away. Inside, the device pretended to be something it was not in the way of most trouble. Layla touched it once, light as the throat of a sleeping child, and then pulled the line that turned its voice into a loop. It would still speak, and their friends would still hear it, but it would be telling the same story it had told an hour ago, not the one it was living now.\n\n\u201cSlow mirror installed,\u201d she said, and her mouth tasted of pleased metal. \u201cIf they are watching, they will be watching yesterday. If they are lazy, they will never notice the day has gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cLazy is a habit, too,\u201d Tariq said, equal parts delight and caution. \u201cCome home.\u201d\n\nThey left samosas and took away nothing anyone would miss on a checklist. The guard accepted two pastries like a man receiving absolution and promised to tell his supervisor that the ladies had been neat and thoughtful. Layla wanted to kiss his forehead for being the kind of man who filed kindness as a professional courtesy. She settled for a blessing that made him blink, which was almost as good.\n\nBack at the Pavilion, the fish sang. Tariq put the feed from the whisper-tag on a screen that only the five of them could see and watched as the outline of a hand reached toward their grate. No face. No brand on a boot. The print was in keystrokes and route pings, not a wrist. A call had been placed to a junior mechanic from what looked like the Facilities desk asking for a sweep of the south wing. The voice\u2014recorded and pitched lower by software afraid of its own timbre\u2014belonged to no one and everyone. The boy who had come at the call was younger than Layla had imagined and sweating like virtue in a sauna. He had done exactly what a good employee should: he had checked the panel, taken a picture for his log, tried to lift the mesh without removing the screws because someone always tries to cheat the step that requires a tool, and then backed away because the grate had bitten him with Tariq\u2019s hidden thread. He had sucked his finger like a child surprised by piano wire and then, because he was conscientious, reported the anomaly to a number that did not belong to the Pavilion.\n\n\u201cInvite him to tea,\u201d Hessa said, before anyone said call security. \u201cBring him to the garden and give him water and look at his hand. He will understand kindness better than a pamphlet about cybersecurity. He will tell you who told him to answer numbers that do not belong to his supervisor.\u201d\n\nThey brought him, the young mechanic with the bitten finger. He had the face of a boy who had learned to carry refrigerators with his uncles and never complained because he loved the way they praised him for being strong. He looked at Layla as if she were a road he had not been told how to cross. She asked after his mother\u2019s health; he answered that she had plantar fasciitis in a tone that meant he did not know why he had told her that and was glad he had. She asked who told him to call the number on his phone and he answered like a man afraid of both silence and sound. The number had appeared in a text from \u201cFacilities Support\u201d two weeks ago with the stamp of someone who knew how to mimic an internal memo. It offered faster solutions, fewer signatures, a way to serve the Pavilion better without bothering the people who were too important to be interrupted. He had believed it because believing it felt like being useful. Layla asked to see his phone; he handed it to her like it was a lucky coin that had stopped working. She photographed the text and the number and the second number that appeared when she tapped on a detail most people never tapped. She handed his phone back and told him that being useful sometimes meant being rude to a lie.\n\nHe left with cookies and a bandage. Tariq had three new threads to pull that tasted like victory because they were, in fact, favors disguised as dumb mistakes. One number traced back to a switchboard in a business park that rented addresses to ghosts. Another pointed, briefly and then with shyness, to a suite on the fifteenth floor of a building where Mireille\u2019s delegation currently slept and dressed and pretended they were not closely watched. This might have been a decoy. It might have been theater. The third number belonged to a woman named Aaliyah who had once worked as a receptionist in a small firm that had been purchased by a larger one and now maintained the fiction of local presence for clients who liked to believe they were hiring neighbors. Aaliyah had a public Instagram full of plants receiving too much water and motivational quotes arranged on tiles like prayers you were allowed to forget at will. Layla sent her a message that said there had been an error in the routing of a maintenance call and that Aaliyah was a dear to help straighten it. Sugar first. Rope later.\n\nThat night, while the city put on its jewelry and pretended the heat was flirting rather than oppressive, Mireille posted a video of herself wearing a falconer\u2019s glove and letting a bird step onto it with clean confidence. The caption was clever and said nothing. Someone else added a line that made it mean something unkind. She turned off comments after fifteen minutes because she had learned to give the world only as many doorways as she could guard. Layla did not answer. Saffiyah did. She reposted a picture of a little girl from yesterday\u2019s panel cupping a geranium seedling with a fierceness that would have made entire armies reconsider their plans and wrote, \u201cOur city is training hands.\u201d The internet, being both cruel and tender in alternating lungfuls, applauded.\n\nSleep was a ricochet that refused to land. When it finally did, it did so at the exact wrong hour. Layla had thirty minutes of heavy, graceless blackout and then woke with the name Nabil on her tongue like a seed she had almost swallowed. She dressed in the quiet way of a person who has never forgotten sleeping beside other people who did not have the luxury to be interrupted by her insomnia. She had promised to be polite in the morning and sharp in the afternoon. The knife waited under the shawl.\n\nThe meeting at ten could have been any meeting in any building designed for moldings to impress men who believed plaster was a personality trait. The table shone like there had never been fingerprints on it. Water bottles stood in tidy formation, their labels aligned as if they were soldiers waiting for a general to sneeze. Nabil arrived with a portfolio like a priest bringing bread. The cousin with the watches did not come; he sent instead a man with the white hands of someone who moves other people\u2019s money and believes it is clean because he has never had to scrub it off. Hessa complimented the pastries; Layla did not sit until everyone had discovered they did not quite know where to place their elbows.\n\nThe paperwork said what paperwork always says when it is asked to be honest: too much and not enough. Layla looked at the same clause three times and each time it revealed a new way to twist itself into manners. She did not raise her voice. She did not accuse. She asked practical questions in a tone that made it impossible to turn her into a bully in a story told later over coffee. Why did the subcontractor invoice carry a markup twice standard for the region? Why had the risk assessment been copied from a white paper about banking infrastructure and not one about water? Why did the emergency contact numbers list a firm in Avalora as if the sea were going to kindly wait while you settled your institutional crush?\n\nNabil took it well until he did not. The moment the sweat appeared on his temple he knew it and resented it. \u201cYou are making me look a thief,\u201d he said softly, and Layla almost sighed because men often thought shape was substance. \u201cI have done nothing others have not done. I have simply done it in a room where you can see me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am making you look responsible,\u201d she said, and her mouth was generous enough that the sentence did not sound like a blow. \u201cWhich is, perhaps, worse in some rooms. But this is not that room. You will help us unwind this braid. You know who tied it. You know who took their percentage and whether they earned it. You know who sent out numbers to boys in good shoes telling them to respond quickly to be useful. You will find them. And before you do, you will write a letter on your company\u2019s letterhead admitting that the hawk was stamped on our house without our permission and asking for our forgiveness. You will name no names. You will not make us appear foolish. You will give us the grace of being the first to say what everyone already knows.\u201d\n\nHessa watched him with grandmother eyes that had never learned to be sentimental. The man with the white hands pretended to be a plant and succeeded for three seconds. Paper moved. The city breathed in a little and did not breathe out yet because it liked to see a man be pressed until he knew he had bones.\n\nAfter, when the room was empty except for crumbs who had never learned to look dignified, Hessa exhaled the breath the building had been holding. \u201cYour father thinks negotiation is a dance,\u201d she said. \u201cYou treat it like a calligraphy exercise that you intend to execute in the middle of a herd of goats. It is an art. I approve.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like goats,\u201d Layla said, rubbing her eyes with the heel of her hand. \u201cThey have no patience for pretension. They eat your schemes.\u201d\n\nAfternoon returned them to the Pavilion just in time for the first proof that the hawk\u2019s tongue had noticed its mirror. A lag in the data feed pricked Tariq\u2019s attention like a nettle. It was the kind of blip you could blame on heat if you wanted to remain lazy. Tariq did not like lazy except when he practiced it as recreational rebellion. He followed the blip from a diverted packet to a looped command to a handshake that died and resurrected with the desperation of an actor missing his cue. The loop was working; their friend was watching a version of the building that was behaving. That meant that somewhere else someone had decided to switch emphasis, to test an edge they had not bothered before. Three minutes later, the fire suppression system in the east gallery hiccupped. It did not release; it thought about releasing and had a half-formed thought about rain. The correct valve yawned and then remembered its manners. No one got wet. A donor got her hair startled. The photograph in the local paper showed her eyes doing the thing eyes do when confronted with the possibility that water might be unacceptable.\n\n\u201cIt was a tap on the window,\u201d Tariq said, high with the thrill he did not allow to show on his face because he respected systems and their moods. \u201cA flirtation. They like the idea of drama. They are seeing if we flinch.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not flinch in public,\u201d Layla said, and the instruction was to herself as much as to the staff. \u201cFlinch here where it is safe.\u201d She went to the valve room and put her hand on the pipe that had almost been unkind. It vibrated with the leftover energy of a decision not taken. She stayed there long enough that Yara cleared her throat twice, and then left with the conviction that a system can be loved into better behavior if its shepherd is stubborn enough.\n\nEvening fell on the city like a lid, not a blanket. The temperature did not drop so much as decide to lean away from cruelty and into endurance. Aaliyah with the overwatered plants sent a message that she had been told by her manager to forward all \u201cspecial maintenance\u201d requests to a list of numbers she was not to question. She included the list. It was a web, not a ladder. It named nobody. It named everyone. It had a rhythm she recognized: men who had built their status on being the person you called when you did not want to call the person you should. It would take time; it would not be an arrest. It would be a dozen small corrections and a few ruined lunches. She was good at lunch.\n\nWhen she had finished the last call and written the last note and set the last small trap that would take three days to spring, Layla let herself be carried by habit up the final flight of stairs to the roof. The night pressed its cool mouth to her forehead the way a mother does when all the scolding has been done and the house is quiet again. The city sang its soft vicious lullaby. She lay down the way she had done since sixteen when she first learned that flat roofs can cure you of believing you are the only person awake. Yara came with blankets and a battery-powered fan that hummed like a cricket who had gotten a promotion. They lay side by side, the way women who trust each other do when the world allows them a horizontal hour.\n\n\u201cYou pressed well,\u201d Yara said into the slice of sky between them. \u201cHe will fold and call it outreach. Another will feel the heat and call it vision. Two more will resent you and find ways to send you love they think is poison. We will drink it and call it lemonade.\u201d\n\n\u201cLemonade would be too sweet,\u201d Layla said. \u201cI want the kind of sour that makes your teeth ache and then goes away and leaves you better for having been awake in your mouth.\u201d She considered Mireille\u2019s face with the bird and Nabil\u2019s watch and the boy\u2019s bitten finger and felt a flicker of absurd gratitude that she was alive in a place that asked her for more than speeches. \u201cIf she is the hawk,\u201d she added after a moment, \u201cshe is not the hand. The hand is domestic and thinks itself benevolent. The hand will be harder to teach because it thinks it is already learned.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we will set out a basin and make it wash itself,\u201d Yara said. \u201cAnd we will watch to see whether it knows to scrub the back and the part between thumb and first finger where men pretend no dirt sticks. We will be here tomorrow and the day after. That is our trick.\u201d\n\nThey slept in shifts that their bodies knew even when their phones did not ring. At three, a cat padded across Layla\u2019s stomach and reminded her of gravity. At four, the muezzin\u2019s voice lifted from the minaret like a cloth laid lightly over a table. At five, a message from an unknown number arrived with the insolent cheer of a person who believes night belongs to them. It was not signed M; it was signed with a hawk alone and a link that promised \u201cproof of carelessness at the Pavilion\u201d. Layla did not click it. She wrote the number down in a hand her grandmother would have recognized and turned the phone face down. She rose, washed, and prayed for the ability to not hate small men who do big damage because she needed that hatred for fuel elsewhere.\n\nBy nine the Pavilion had another tour and another reason to smile and another person risking the sin of calling it flawless in print. By noon the schoolchildren beat the CEOs at the Sorting Cup so beautifully that half the adults in the room conspicuously arranged to be on the children\u2019s team for the last round. By two the hawk\u2019s mirror caught an unfamiliar hand at their grate, this time nimble enough to unscrew what could not be lifted. By two-oh-three the hand froze because it felt, not heard, the small current that coursed through the mesh. By two-oh-four the phone in the hand vibrated with a text that read abort in a language that carried vowels like knives. By two-oh-six, the person attached to the hand had gone, but not, for once, so fast they became a blur. Cameras that had learned indifference from long practice remembered how to be curious. Tariq ran the footage through a machine that did not look like a machine and saw what he needed: not a face, never a face, but a shirt that did not belong to any contractor signed that day and a shoulder seam that had been repaired by a tailor with a particular habit of using gold thread hidden where only other tailors would notice.\n\n\u201cUncle in the salvage yard has that habit,\u201d Saffiyah said, more a thought than a boast. \u201cBut he would never sew for those men. He hates them because they throw their televisions away when the remote breaks. There is a man on Tahlia who fixes suits for chauffeurs who do not want their bosses to know their dogs chewed their cuffs. He uses gold where he thinks no one will find it because he says a gentleman should always carry a secret shine.\u201d\n\n\u201cFind the gentleman,\u201d Layla said, and it felt almost ridiculous to be tracking a man through a stitch when you had wires singing secrets in your walls. It felt, also, like the only way to catch a habit is to notice where it has tried to dress itself up.\n\nEvening delivered the man with the secret shine to a shop that sold cufflinks that looked like tiny anchors and ties that looked like apologies. He was not a villain; he was a nephew. He was a brother. He had a face that would not trouble his mother while she prayed. He had been given a job by a cousin who told him it was patriotism to help build a resilience network against foreign interference. The irony of a domestic hand dressed in a foreign hawk was not lost on him and would never make him do or not do anything. Layla pressed him in the slow manner of a woman fitting a glove. He gave her enough names to thicken the knot. He did not know he had given her more with the way his eyes moved only at the word Avalora and not at the names of the men who had called him brother while paying him cash.\n\nThe door of everything continued to swing on small hinges. Each time she touched one, Layla felt the old joy, not of power, but of competence. She could do this. She had made herself the kind of person who knew which screw to pocket and which to leave half-turn loose so that when the wrong hand tried it, the whole contraption would squeal. She did not need the desert to forgive her or the city to applaud her; she needed only to move the next stubborn thing into a better place. When Hessa brought her tea at midnight, silent and bearing the kind of sugar only a woman who has stayed alive through four versions of the city knows how to offer, Layla drank it and let the burn coat her tongue. Tomorrow would be noisy. Tomorrow would try to be theater. She intended to make it a math problem with manners.\n\nOn a different roof across town, under a sky that did not mean the same thing to anyone who had not grown here, a woman in white watched a city that declined to be contained in the edges of any one story. Mireille set her glass down with the careful distaste of someone avoiding fingerprints and said to a man who liked being furniture in other people\u2019s rooms, \u201cShe presses. She is better than the last one. Tell them to stop playing at taps and dribbles. If they wish to embarrass her, they need to stop pretending they are artists and return to their own craft.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is our craft, Highness?\u201d the man asked, and if there was irony in the honorific he had doctored it into submission before it reached his tongue.\n\n\u201cPackaging,\u201d she said, and smiled with only her top lip. \u201cMake the mess look like a gift. Tie it with a bow. Send it to her with her own name on the card. If she opens it in public, we are not to blame.\u201dThe first clue arrived with a bow so neat Hessa laughed when the porter wheeled it into the Pavilion\u2019s service bay. The paper was thick enough to use as a tray, the ribbon a white that had never met air. On the lid, in tasteful azure, someone had printed the Pavilion\u2019s signature hexagon pattern and, beneath it, Layla\u2019s initials with the crown so small you would miss it unless you wanted to hate her. The shipping labels were impeccable and unhelpful. The sender of record was a logistics firm that no one who worked for the logistics firm admitted existed, the way public bathrooms never acknowledge the ghosts that share their mirrors. The receiving clerk signed because people in uniforms sign when confronted with expensive-looking rectangles and confidence. By the time Yara stepped into the bay and tasted the air for the sour of something wrong, six more pallets had been rolled in by men who whistled not because they were happy but because the melody gave their guilt a tune.\n\n\u201cWho ordered a hundred of these?\u201d the clerk asked, only half apologetic, because if a thing has ribbon it must have approval. \u201cIt says Desert Bloom Home Starter. It says \u2018compliments of Her Highness.\u2019 It says \u2018unveil at luncheon\u2019. It says all the things.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt says trap,\u201d Yara murmured without moving her mouth, and Layla, who had arrived on the tail of the scent of manufactured lavender, felt an old classroom in her thigh muscles as if she had just been assigned a difficult problem with too much arithmetic and not enough paper. She circled the nearest box as if it might bolt. The print quality was too good, the UV varnish on the hexagon too precise, the crease on the ribbon moleculary arrogant. She found the seam with her fingernail, lifted, and let the lid confess.\n\nInside lay a curated green dream: compostable cutlery made of some smooth white that looked at first glance like bone and at second like sugar; cups stamped compost in a font so round it looked friendly; sachets of smart labels promising to make every household \u201ca hero\u201d by turning their daily waste into a game; a small glossy booklet with photographs of smiling brown children holding seedling trays as solemnly as prayers; and a card in a hand that imitated her own without understanding its restraint. \u201cTo our city,\u201d the card read. \u201cStart at home. With gratitude, L.\u201d It was the sort of thing people wanted her to have said, which made it more dangerous than if it had been outrageous.\n\nHessa lifted the booklet between two fingers as if removing a dead bee from a bowl of sugar. \u201cIf you were going to do this,\u201d she said dryly, \u201cyou would choose a different font. You are not a woman built of rounded edges.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I would not write \u2018with gratitude\u2019 like an aunt from Aswan,\u201d Layla said, scanning the booklet to see if they had stolen her words or simply their rhythm. The photographs were knife-sharp and almost emotionally accurate, which was worse. The cutlery claimed to be plant-based in five languages and carried a small footnote with the honesty of a sinner who has learned that confessions make friends: industrial composting required. The city did not have an industrial composter capable of chewing this polymer. The Pavilion\u2019s composters were worms and bacteria and heat and the kind of patience Layla had to pray for. This white, if fed to them, would gum their mouths and stifle their appetite. The cups boasted miraculous degradation in twelve weeks and carried a trademark of a company with two addresses and a lawyer for a receptionist. The smart labels were the real mouth. When Tariq glanced at one, the muscles around his eyes tightened in a way that meant he had discovered a cleverness he disliked.\n\n\u201cThey are NFCs,\u201d he murmured, turning the label over gently as if it might bruise. \u201cThey will talk to your phone when you do not ask them to. The default action is to open a web page and tally your heroics with stars and a confetti animation when you have sorted correctly. Charming and sticky. The page lives behind a content delivery network that is not here. The sort of architecture you rent when you want to be too big to trace. The tracking parameters include geotags and session IDs.\u201d He looked up and did not make a face because he had learned long ago that faces in the presence of problems can be used against you. \u201cThe first time someone uses one of these at home, it will send back their address, their button presses, and their habits. That could be benign. It is not benign when the front door says this came from you.\u201d\n\nBasim came at a jog that pretended to be a walk because cameras should never arrive sweaty. He took in the boxes in one sweep, the ribbon, the font, the clerks pretending not to have nerves, and his expression did a small, appreciative sigh that meant the day would be messy and his work would be good. \u201cIt is beautiful,\u201d he said, because beauty is often the first step in a crime, and took a photograph of the bow before any knife touched it. \u201cHow many?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne hundred,\u201d Yara said, already moving, already telling men with sleeves rolled to their elbows that the boxes should be moved away from the floor drains and the compost inlet and the blue bins marked plastic because accidents have an appetite for proximity. \u201cOne hundred, and our luncheon is in an hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd an hour is a lifetime when the person you are about to dine with wants you to trip over your own generosity,\u201d Hessa said. She peeled the label that tried to mimic Layla\u2019s monogram and held it to the light. There were microletters in the ribbon\u2019s edge. She had to fetch her new readers. The letters read, in tiny, smug font, H&H PACKAGING, a hawk\u2019s claw holding a hand barely visible unless you had been taught to see it. Hessa made a sound that might have been a swear if it had been another woman\u2019s mouth. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course they put their name on the bow. Men do love a flourish.\u201d\n\nLayla looked at the boys on the loading bay, at their new shoes and their careful posture and the way their eyes slid, ashamed to have brought a problem into a place their mothers admired. She crouched to be level with the nearest. \u201cWho brought you these?\u201d she asked, not a witch-hunt, not a trick. He blinked and swallowed and told her about a man in a tidy jacket who did not give a name and a van that did not have a license plate that would charm a police officer. The paperwork had been scanned and signed in a hallway that did not smell like this one; the signature had belonged to a woman in Purchasing who would swear she had never signed it and whose ballpoint pen had been stolen three days ago.\n\n\u201cWe could refuse and return,\u201d Yara said, voice clean as a blade. \u201cWe could issue a statement and make men chew their tongues on their way down the drive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could,\u201d Layla said, thinking of Mireille\u2019s mouth around a laugh at the falconer\u2019s perch, of the hawk and the hand playing at kindness and packaging the mess with a bow. \u201cOr we could open one in front of our guests. We could show them the truth of materials. We could make the room smarter and therefore harder to poison next time.\u201d\n\nHessa fixed her with Tante Eyes that had coaxed a generation into eating vegetables and apologizing properly. \u201cYou are going to unbox the trap like a performance,\u201d she said, both resigned and amused. \u201cYou are going to make a ritual of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cCeremony is how we nail truth to the floor,\u201d Layla said, and the old pleasure of being a girl in a closet with her sisters and a locked safe present and laughing under her breath came back, sweet as a fig. \u201cGet me a hot plate. Get me vinegar, salt, a beaker, an ice bowl. Get me one of the clear cylinders from the water docents; the ones with the laser-etched marks. Tariq, I want a burner profile for this white cutlery; what does it do when it meets flame at low, then high? Does it sweeten the air or make it sour? Does it curl like a lie or collapse like an apology? Basim, I will give you a picture to love. Do not make it pretty; make it obvious. And someone find me a tailor on Tahlia who sews with gold where no one will see, because I owe him a compliment.\u201d\n\nThe luncheon wanted to be a chorus. It had white chairs that had never learned humility and plates that expected to be reflected in other plates. The donors arrived with their bracelets disguised as watches, the ministers with their neckties disguised as personal taste, the foreign press with their smiles disguised as teeth. The Pavilion reflected them all back with its usual patience. Layla carried the first box to the stage and set it down as if it were one more offering to the city; the cameras clicked because novelty is a royalty of its own. Hessa stood behind her with a tray that had served princes and plumbers and made no distinction between them. On the tray: a small flame in a glass hood, a clear cylinder, a bowl of ice, a jug of water, a pinch of salt, a dish of vinegar, a lilac glove because jokes ease the parts of the brain that learn faster when they are not afraid. Tariq, offstage, whispered as if to a child who needed something to hold. \u201cFlame steady. Do not let it flare. The polymer is PLA with filler. Low heat, it will soften; high heat, it will char and release lactide that smells like waffles if you do not know better. The filler will give you ash. Vinegar will do nothing; salt will be cruel. The cup is a different beast. It will warp like pride and then sulk.\u201d\n\n\u201cFriends,\u201d Layla said, and Basim later would say the recording of that word saved them three days of bleeding. \u201cWelcome. Someone, kind or otherwise, brought us gifts. I am a woman who believes in generosity and in proof. Today, let\u2019s unwrap a kindness together and see what is inside.\u201d\n\nShe held the cutlery up and did not name the brand because brands are like demons and enjoy recognition. She pinched the fork where its throat would be if it were a living thing and held it over the small flame. It softened as predicted, looked penitent, then blackened at the edge with a humor that would have fooled a room less interested in truth. A small collective noise rose as the faux-sugar smell of sweet plastic slid into the noses of men who were not used to smelling anything other than spice and their own cologne. She held the fork\u2019s bowed head and touched it, gently, to the bowl of ice. It stiffened with theatrical righteousness, as single-use righteousness does when confronted with the cold. She dunked it in the cylinder of water and watched an oil-slick shimmer gather around its wound.\n\n\u201cThis is compostable,\u201d she said, not accusing, not soft. \u201cIf you own an industrial composter. We do not. Not yet. At home, even at scale, this will become a tantrum in your soil. We will not feed it to our worms. They work too hard to teach them bitterness. We will not feed it to the sea. The sea is already tired of our excuses. We will teach our suppliers to print bigger footnotes and to sell us the thing we can actually digest.\u201d\n\nShe set the coy polymer aside and picked up the smart label as if it were a fig leaf and she was not interested in the tree. \u201cThis sticker will gamify your virtue,\u201d she said, smiling because sometimes you must be bright to cut. \u201cIt will award you stars. It will share your habits with a server in a country that enjoys watching you try. Today, we will teach it to applaud something else.\u201d She tapped her phone to the label and the Pavilion\u2019s captive mirror caught the handshake and fed it a page Tariq had prepared that looked like the one it expected\u2014thumbs up, confetti, a goat who had learned to wink\u2014and, beneath it, in letters clean enough to teach a child to write, a sentence that said, Our homes are not theaters; we will not be measured without consent. The confetti fell anyway, because confetti is cheap and appetites are not. Someone laughed in a way that made the room forgive itself for having almost been made into a measuring device.\n\nShe poured vinegar into the cylinder and sprinkled salt and let the room smell like a kitchen instead of a gala. She spoke about labels and ladders and the difference between promises and processes. When she cursed greenwashing she did it politely, in Arabic that made even her disapproval sound like an elegant aunt. When she said we, she meant it, because she had been the one to sign contracts in good faith and the one to untie knots in bad. By the time she set the ribbon back on the box and handed it to Hessa as if they were taking a dessert into the staff room to be eaten secretly where no one could be offended, the room had learned three new things: never trust white cutlery that calls itself plant-based in small letters; never trust stickers that give you stars for doing what your grandmother already taught you; and never again leave a ribbon unexamined in a house that has decided to bother itself.\n\nBasim\u2019s photographs did what photographs can do when they have the right hands guiding them; he caught her mouth laughing while black polymer stuck between her gloves like spun sugar, he caught Hessa\u2019s shawl turned into shade and then into weapon and then into love, he caught a donor who had been born old and the moment he looked young because learning made him so. The headlines that might have been unkind did not get a chance to be cruel; the internet, presented with a woman burning a fork in a crystal room, chose to be entertained by accuracy.\n\nBehind the stage, the back-of-house had its own performance. Yara followed the delivery men who were now very interested in becoming invisible. She knew which hallway made men feel that a good lie was possible and chose the other. In the loading bay she came up behind a driver whose sleeve hem had been repaired with a flash of gold that did not show unless you knelt to tie your shoe. She pointed at his seam as if admiring a flower and said, \u201cTahlia?\u201d He flinched because guilt recognizes the names of streets the way lovers recognize the names of scars. He said he did not know how to read; she said she did not need him to read to tell her how much he had been paid. He told her the truth because her voice promised to be a kinder place than the lie.\n\nThe pickup order in his glove compartment had been printed on cheap stock that had pretended to be expensive. It named a suite in the Aftan as origin; it also named a basement room in a building on an outer ring road where ghosts are rented by the hour. It had a reference that made Tariq\u2019s eyebrows go up when she photographed it and sent it to his hungry machines. DB-Home Starter, the code read. The small letters under it read H&H Unit Q3; the smallest letters read trial one. The careless flourish of the hawk\u2019s icon winked at the bottom of the page like a man who has told a joke he thinks is not just clever but kind. Yara let the driver go with a warning that carried an invitation to honesty the next time money met him after dark. She took the seam with her by cutting it with her small pocket blade and kept the gold shred because habits like this deserved cataloguing.\n\nNabil texted a smiling face at the exact moment Layla needed him to and then came himself later, which was better. He had the look of a man who has realized he is not at the center of the story but can earn a footnote that will keep him from being humbled at family gatherings. He stood beside Layla at the press table and co-signed a statement that Hessa had written in a tone that made people think they had chosen to be better. \u201cEffective immediately,\u201d it read, \u201cthe Pavilion and its partners will refuse any materials not labeled for the actual systems available to us. We will publish those systems in plain language. We will work with suppliers to stop lying to themselves and then to us; we will shift our budget from ribbon to rope and pull people up instead of wrapping boxes.\u201d The foreign press liked the rope line; the domestic papers liked the small nod to cousin procurement implied in the confession. Nobody liked being made to feel stupid by a fork, which was useful.\n\nMireille watched from a hotel room that had been designed to look like restraint. The footage of Layla setting plant-plastic to a flame and refusing confetti made her laugh in a key that suggested honest amusement had elbowed past contempt to sit down for a minute. She poured a drink she did not finish and told a man who had flown in from a country that owned more copper than it could digest to stop letting junior operatives play with water when all they knew was how to package air. \u201cWe are not artists,\u201d she said, the consonants in her mouth like ice. \u201cOur craft is presentation. The thing must look like a gift; it must feel like a favor; it must be the recipient\u2019s own voice telling them to open it in public. This was clumsy. I despise clumsy.\u201d She pinched the bridge of her nose in a gesture she had learned from an aunt who had raised her on rooms full of other people\u2019s opinions. \u201cTell them to try again. Or better: tell them to wait. She is teaching her city, and you cannot embarrass a woman who has chosen to be seen learning.\u201d\n\nIn the long shadow of afternoon, the salvage yard smelled like rain that had failed to arrive three days ago and had left the promise of it as a residue. Layla stood with the Uncle among refrigerators who had been faithful friends and bicycles who had known joy and disappointment in equal measure. She showed him the ribbon and the microletters that bragged more than they intended and the gold thread from the driver\u2019s seam. He snorted softly, the way men snort when they see the footprints of a lie that has tried to hide itself with perfume and has forgotten mud tells stories too. He named the tailor on Tahlia without using his shop\u2019s name; he named him by the way he stitched and the tea he served to men who could not pay for alterations they needed to save face. He told Layla to be kind to him because he had sons who did not always say no when a cousin called.\n\n\u201cI am always kind if it will fit,\u201d she said, and he grunted as if to say kindness is a garment you stretch without tearing when you can and fold away when you cannot.\n\nThe tailor had soft hands and tired eyes and a wife who did not like the way certain customers leaned across his counter. He recognized the gold thread at once, as if Layla had held up a lock of hair. He did not pretend not to know what she meant when she asked if he had sewn a jacket for a man whose sleeve would have needed this particular mercy last night. He weighed a small lie on his tongue, found it bitter, spat it out. \u201cHe is a nephew,\u201d he said, and his accent put an old city in the middle of his consonants. \u201cHe is a good boy when he is not working for his cousin. He carried a box that looked expensive; he said it was for good. I cannot choose his work for him, but I can decide not to finish the hem next time unless he tells me the truth.\u201d\n\nLayla left a bill she could afford on the counter because she had not come to buy anything and had borrowed a little dignity instead. The tailor pressed it back with the back of his fingers and said, embarrassed and stubborn, \u201cLet me pay for the shame I would have felt if you had left money on my table after asking me to be brave.\u201d She took it as instruction. Outside she stood in heat that had learned not to be cruel for three minutes and let herself feel the hard shape of habits, domestic and imported, rubbing together until they made sparks. She was tired enough to laugh if someone had made a very specific kind of joke. No one did, which was a mercy.\n\nAt the Palace that night, the envelope on the table by the garden door had the agreeable weight of paper that expects its contents to be treated as an event. Hessa would have let it sit until morning because patience is a sport she plays better than Layla, but Yara picked it up and shook it in a way that would have given a lesser letter a bruise. Inside was a small bell, the kind that hangs from a falcon\u2019s jess, silver and needlessly pretty. Alongside it lay a list of names typed on a machine set to a font that tried to look official and failed because it had been chosen by a man who had learned taste from catalogs. The names were not government. They were the men who change locks when nobody asks, the men who write routing codes when someone says the word \u201cstreamline\u201d in a room that smells like coffee and ambition, the men who own trucks that move things that are never weighed. At the bottom, in a small, tidy hand that was almost familiar if you had met it with a different sentence, someone had written: You will open this in private because you are careful. Consider it a favor, not a gift. Consider returning it when you are done. M.\n\nHessa, reading over her shoulder, made a noise that could have been derision or respect depending on the angle. \u201cShe has learned how to play you,\u201d she said. \u201cNot by injury. By opportunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is not wrong,\u201d Layla said, rolling the bell in her palm until it warmed and sang a little without being asked to. \u201cI will teach my city faster with this than without. I will salt it with lies because I like to know whether my soup is being tasted by a thief. I will not thank her.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will thank yourself,\u201d Yara said, setting tea on the table and not pretending she was not listening. \u201cThat is better sport. And you will return this list in a different envelope.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith ribbon,\u201d Saffiyah called from the far sofa where she was making a necklace out of the abandoned smart labels because she never let pretty things go to waste even if they were spying on you. \u201cA big ribbon, so she can choke on it if she chooses.\u201d\n\nLayla laughed then, properly, because sisters are fences that tell you where the garden ends and the dark begins. She sat, finally, and let the dark get her ankles while the bell made its small honest sound in her palm. Tomorrow she would call the men on the list and ask them for help in the tone that makes men obey because they like to think they are helpful. Tomorrow she would feed the hawk\u2019s mirror a story it would enjoy and then close the window slowly, like a polite host who walks a guest to the door and makes sure their car is really gone before locking it. Tomorrow she would send a package of her own with paper that did not lie and a note that said less than it meant. Tonight she ate the last sambusa and let the city\u2019s hum rethread the tired parts of her until they fit again.\n\nMorning arrived wearing a breeze that had pretended affection and settled for civility. The boxes had been stacked in a storeroom where their arrogance would not rub off on anything else, labels catalogued, ribbons cut and kept because Hessa had decided they would one day make a useful rope in a pinch. The Pavilion shrugged off the theatrics and returned to being a building that made water out of light and discipline. The first school tour of the day moved past the waste stations with fresh confidence; the children tapped the smart labels that now linked to a page that taught them how to smell a lie and then gave them a printable certificate that said You are harder to fool than a ribbon, which made teachers smile for the rest of the day. In the control room, the loop fed the hawk the old day again, and if someone noticed that the goat winked with its left eye instead of its right today, they did not take the trouble to be suspicious.\n\nThe men on the list answered their phones with three different varieties of defensiveness and two of charm. Layla did not speak like a prosecutor. She asked them to help write a policy that would make their lives easier in the long run by refusing to reroute calls through ghost switchboards. She spoke to their vanity and their fatigue in equal measure. She scheduled a meeting in a room with bad coffee and good chairs because good chairs make men imagine they are making history. While she was on her second call, Tariq slipped a printout under her hand the way a waiter who knows your favorite dish appears when you have not looked up from your argument. The QR that had smiled confetti the day before, when called properly without a mirror, now resolved to a low-resolution video of Layla at a podium endorsing the Home Starter kit in exactly the tone of moral calm that had made people trust her. Her mouth moved in phrases she had used in other rooms; the audio did not precisely match. The edit made her sound flatter and less funny and more like a saint, which was how you knew it was not her.\n\n\u201cIt went live for forty minutes on an Avaloran page,\u201d Tariq said, which in his language meant he had already pulled it from five different servers and had an archivist in Belgium preparing to copy the copy. \u201cThey pulled it when your polymer burned. It would have done work if it had an hour. There is a watermark in one corner visible only if you squint like an uncle. The watermark is the name of a boutique PR firm that sold a man we both have met a campaign two years ago about helmets that did nothing to prevent concussions and everything to move product. The man did not learn. The firm did.\u201d\n\n\u201cSend them flowers,\u201d Layla said, without lifting her eyes from the paper in which a man named Ghassan explained, kindly and condescendingly, that rerouting numbers is a harmless way to prevent the important from being interrupted. \u201cSend them a basket of figs with a card that says, \u2018We saw your edit and appreciated your work on the room tone. We would like you to consult on a children\u2019s program about media literacy.\u2019 Basim will photograph the basket going in and the receptionist not knowing whether to smile. Then forget their name for a month while we build something that cannot be prettied into a worse version of itself.\u201d\n\nAt noon the falconers arrived with three birds and a boy new to the work who could not stop smiling long enough to tie a knot. Hessa took him aside and taught him to breathe in a way that steadied his fingers and his future, which is exactly what an aunt does when she knows she cannot catch the bird for you. In the afternoon, Layla walked into a room that had been arranged for the men who were the hand, not the hawk, and found them willing, if not immediately able, to admit that they preferred being asked to be better to being called thieves. She bought them time by spending her own and made them write down a list of the numbers they had given out as favors to make themselves necessary. She kept the paper and gave them a promise that if they called her the next time someone asked for a back door she would answer even if she was at a wedding.\n\nIn the evening, on a terrace that had never learned humility because it had never been asked to sit with plumbers, Mireille removed her shoes and put her feet on a tile that had been baked by men who would never know her name. She held the falcon\u2019s bell Layla had returned with a ribbon twice as big as the first and read the card. It said only, Package accepted. Ribbon retained. She laughed in a way that startled a small, honest smile out of the woman bringing her tea. \u201cShe will be annoying,\u201d she said to the tea. \u201cI will enjoy it.\u201d Then she set the bell down beside her and stopped touching it because nostalgia was the only thing she allowed herself to almost indulge and no more.\n\nWhen the sun stopped pretending to be gentle and went to hide its leftover fire behind the skyline, Layla climbed to the roof and lay flat because roofs tell the truth. Yara put the fan on her face and did not speak for the time it took a satellite to cross the sky. The city hummed like an engine that had not been trusted in a long time and had decided to be reliable anyway. Somewhere a box that looked like a gift sat on a shelf and gathered dust and humility. Somewhere a ribbon was being tied around a story that would not survive the room it had been designed to embarrass. Somewhere in a house that did not please her, a woman in white considered whether sewing a habit into a silk dress was possible without the scratch showing. Layla, in gray, with ash on her gloves and oil on her heart, decided to sleep before she learned what the next package would hold, because mornings are better friends when you treat them tenderly at night.Morning came dressy with dust, the kind that does not bother your eyes so much as remind your skin that this city was always a story written on grit. Layla woke to messages stacked like bread on a tray she had not ordered. One showed water the color of tea running from a tap in a clinic near Wadi Laban; a caption claimed the Pavilion\u2019s lines had backflowed poison into a charity\u2019s sink. Another was a voice note in a mother\u2019s breathless register asking if babies should be bathed in bottled water until the government remembered how to be ashamed. She let her phone lie on the pillow while she made her wudu because sometimes ritual is the only way to lay a pathway through noise. By the time she pressed her forehead to the mat, the ache in her chest had arranged itself into tasks. She rose with a mouth that tasted like oath and mint.\n\nHessa had already found her sandals and a scarf that made Layla look more aunt than princess, which was a shape that made people tell the truth faster. Yara had the car at the side entrance, her clipboard empty on purpose because she preferred to take notes in the corner of her head where no one could subpoena them. Tariq climbed in backward because he refused to buy a bag that would fit all his cables and he always looked like a crow that had fallen in love with string. The city at this hour was the sound of thin commerce and thick prayer. A boy with a crate of rolls on his head crossed in front of them with all the gravity of a prophet who had discovered butter.\n\nAt the clinic a little crowd had already grafted itself onto the door, each person with a question ballooned into a theory by the heat. The tap ran brown into a metal bowl that had lost its shine from too many scrubbings. It smelled like fear and tannin, not sewage, which was a difference only a certain kind of nose bothers to respect. A nurse with henna faded to humility on her hands stood like a fence between two goats that insisted the other had eaten the garden. Layla stepped into the doorway and said peace in a tone that mothers use when their children can still hear the old rules behind the new noise. The nurse blinked, said Layla\u2019s name, and then stopped saying names because the room had started to tether itself to her quiet.\n\n\u201cShow me the tank,\u201d Layla asked, and the nurse laughed once in relief because anyone who asked for the tank had to be a person who knew water is a journey before it is a drink. They climbed the stairs that had memorized a century of slippers. On the roof the sun had already begun to push shoulders; the storage cylinders sat in their shade cages like obedient sea creatures taken inland. Tariq knocked the side of one gently and listened to its answer; Yara ran a palm along the lock of the cage and found it notched with a tool that had not been made for kindness. The hatch on the nearest tank wore a bandage of tape that had been torn by a left hand. Inside, floating like a joke played by a mean uncle, a clear sachet swelled with something that bled brown when you whispered heat at it.\n\n\u201cIt is tea concentrate,\u201d Tariq said softly, because his grandmother had taught him to tell the difference between food dye and something you should put into a story for the police. He fished the sachet out with a gloved hand and held it up to the light. The hawk\u2019s icon did not dare to show itself this time; the seam told its own story. The polymer would dissolve in an hour on a hot day; it would leave behind no poison, only a hundred mothers\u2019 panic. It was the sort of sabotage that thinks itself clever because it does not murder. It only pokes faith and watches it bruise.\n\nLayla asked Yara for the clear cylinder she had used on the stage and the little flame she had refused to travel without since yesterday because people learn from the same shapes even if the lesson is different. She lit the flame; she filled the cylinder with water from the tank after they had ladled the brown out and closed the hatch with a hairpin she had pulled from her sleeve. She looked around at the cluster of bodies edging into a congregation and waited until they were quiet without asking. Then she took the sachet and slit it with a woman\u2019s joke of a knife.\n\n\u201cThis is a prank that thinks it is a plan,\u201d she said. \u201cIt frightens because we love our children. It will not make anyone sick. Do not let anyone make money from your fear. Watch.\u201d She dissolved a thread of the concentrate into the water and it obeyed by becoming pretty in the way amber can be when it traps nothing but light. She poured a measure into a second cylinder with a filter that had been designed for hiking and for poor plumbing. The filtered water came out clear enough to embarrass the tea without insulting the tea\u2019s mother. Basim, who had learned to arrive with a camera when the air smelled like someone else\u2019s agenda, took a picture that made the brown look ashamed and the clear look like an answer.\n\n\u201cWhoever climbed your roof is a coward,\u201d Hessa said, loud enough for the men at the back with the phones to record her eyebrows. \u201cThey did not trust their own argument, so they borrowed yours. Come by the Pavilion later and have coffee. We will send you home with a filter if you need one, and if your landlord tells you to mind your gender and stop asking him for modernity, send him to me. I am the right gender for the conversation.\u201d\n\nThe children clustered near the doorway didn\u2019t understand the politics but understood the kindness because kindness and clarity braid in the same place in a child\u2019s mind. Layla let a little girl hold the pouch so she could feel mischief that had lost its costume. She told an uncle in a blue shirt how to watch a tanker fill his building\u2019s tanks without accepting a bribe and losing the disinfectant dose. She made everyone look at the rivet on the cage, made them memorize the way an honest one sat flush and a tampered one wore new scratches like vanity, and if she sounded like someone\u2019s grandmother in the telling, it did not injure her pride. The crowd dissolved into pairs walking side by side because problem solving returns people to their errands. A boy shouted that the Princess made the water do a trick; a woman corrected gently that the water had been fine and the trick had been the lie.\n\nOn the ride back, surface streets thick with men who believed horns were punctuation, Layla\u2019s phone chimed with a voice she would have recognized in a field of ten thousand. The imam of the clinic\u2019s neighborhood had sent a note that he would preach patience and plague stories at noon, the old ones where Moses had to tell people that grief can drown you even in a desert. She thanked him and asked if he would let her sit quietly in the back row because she did better work when reminded of what nothing human can improve upon. He sent her an emoji of a date palm that made her throat ache with the simplicity of being invited.\n\nThe list that had come with the bell sat on her desk like a tame thing trying not to remember it was born feral. She and Hessa salted it with three lies so neatly that even Yara admired their stitches. Two names were moved to the top that did not deserve it; one number was swapped for another that would not pick up because the owner had a dentist appointment he would tell his cousin about when it began to hurt. They called six men before lunch and invited them to a \u201cquiet technical consultation at the Pavilion\u201d with soup, bread, and a chance to speak without being quoted, three things that can make even a liar tell the truth faster than a subpoena. Four agreed with relief because they wanted to stop doing something they could not quite name. One refused because he understood that being better sometimes makes you less rich, and he had not made his peace with that sacrament. The last did not answer, which Layla wrote down as a yes in the column marked later.\n\nMireille sent roses. They arrived in a crate that had crossed two borders without bruising a single petal. The note was handwritten in a script that had been taught by a governess with a velvet ruler. \u201cFor your stagecraft,\u201d it read. \u201cI almost preferred your fire, but even I know a woman cannot choose the same weapon twice and keep an audience.\u201d Layla snorted, which in her was a small sound; Saffiyah pinned one of the roses in her own hair and pretended she didn\u2019t care that it made her look crownless and royal at once. Yara untied the ribbon like a patient snake charmer and shook out the microletters hidden in the satin. They read nothing this time, which was their own kind of confession.\n\n\u201cInvite her to a wash day,\u201d Saffiyah suggested, wicked sweetness in her smile. \u201cIn the old city. The women will teach her what waste means when you have only three buckets and more clothes than patience. We will stand in the courtyard and drink sweet tea and make her think we are joking while we arrange her soul in a drawer she did not know she had.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will, but not now,\u201d Layla said, looking at her schedule and feeling the itch of the afternoon\u2019s meeting with the hand that had not learned to be quiet yet. \u201cToday we sew men to policies and ask them to admire the fit.\u201d\n\nThe consultation room they had claimed for the afternoon was a lovely lie of a space\u2014indirect light, a carpet that softened a man\u2019s calves into thinking he was safe, chairs that forgave you for slouching. The men came with their phones face down as if that would make them less guilty and their pens at the ready as if policy were a shopping list. Ghassan was among them, which pleased Layla because she had been composing a conversation with him in a quiet corner of her mind for three days. He had a good voice for television and a worse voice for apologies. He wore his wedding ring two notches too loose because he liked to spin it while appearing thoughtful, and it clicked against the table when he did not catch it, which told her more than she needed about a certain week two years ago.\n\nShe did not begin with accusation; she began with a story about a grandmother who boiled every pot not for distrust but for method, because habit sits heavier than fear and makes fewer mistakes. She showed them the sachet and the bow, the seam and the microletters. She told them about the boy with the bitten finger and the driver with the gold thread. She asked them to write, in their own hands, the words I will not reroute a call without my supervisor\u2019s signature and my name beneath, and then to sign as if signature were a sacrament. Men who do not fear courts sometimes fear stationery sets. The pens scratched. The soup cooled. The bread broke into hands old enough to have understood that drama is tiring and maintenance is underrated. When she turned to Ghassan, she did not say his name with extra polish or demand that the room watch him swallow something unpleasant. She did not need to.\n\n\u201cI am not the hawk,\u201d he said, before she could ask. \u201cI did not stamp a hand on your house. I took a call I should not have. I allowed a cousin to impress me. I am tired of cousins, Layla.\u201d He rubbed his ring, and it clicked again. \u201cTell me where to put them so they cannot press themselves onto my mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cSend them to the Salvage Uncle on a Friday,\u201d Layla said, because sometimes the answer is not a firing but a humble errand. \u201cIf they can find a use for a broken oscillating fan and an incomplete ladder without bribing anyone, hire them. If they cannot, make them carry the fan and the ladder back to the man they took them from and apologize. Also, give me their numbers. The phone is the cousin you think you can manage, and that is your error.\u201d\n\nAfter the men left, lighter because their pockets were heavier with agreements they understood, Basim slid into the doorway with the sort of grin that made his mother tired and his editor proud. He had visited the Avaloran art event in Layla\u2019s place because she had sent him and because he knew, better than anyone, how to look like furniture and remember every conversation that happened over him. He put three photographs on the table with the flourish of a magician ending the trick he never announced. One showed a room with walls the exact color of money, a projection of water cast on a wall as if liquid would enjoy being turned into a backdrop. One showed a woman whose face you might recognize from a balcony and whose dress was cut to make you forget her name. The third showed Mireille with a glass she did not finish, a tilt to her head that suggested she was uninstalling the patience she had affixed for public. The man she spoke with had a napkin folded very precisely and a bruise along the edge of his jaw that had been powdered without skill.\n\n\u201cHe is the PR boutique owner,\u201d Basim said, tapping the picture where a ring should have been and was not. \u201cHe asked me if we were hiring cameramen at the Pavilion, as if cameras were weapons one could buy and point. He recommended himself like a man offering a knife in a kitchen while a cake is in the oven.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you take his knife?\u201d Hessa asked, amused and not.\n\n\u201cI told him we were looking for aunties from old neighborhoods to run our comments section,\u201d Basim said primly. \u201cHe laughed like he understood humor and then asked me if I knew what NFC stood for. I told him it stood for No Free Confetti.\u201d\n\nThe slow mirror that had been savoring its own cleverness twitched in Tariq\u2019s ear at dusk. The hawk\u2019s mouth asked an old question with a new urgency: status of east gallery suppression. The loop answered sweetly with yesterday\u2019s manners. Meanwhile the west wing\u2019s humidity sensor saw a number that did not belong to this climate and sighed with confusion. Somewhere, not far, a junior tried a command in a foreign console that would have been elegant had it been written for the right infrastructure. The foam did not release; it thought about releasing for exactly one breath and then blushed and took it back. Layla put her palm on the valve casing as if touching a heart through a coat and told it, firmly, that it was loved and would not embarrass the woman who had been good to it. Hessa rolled her eyes and pretended she did not believe in talking to pipes while sliding pastries into a tin for the security guards who were terrible at packing their own dinners.\n\nAt the small mosque behind the salvage yard, where the fan makes a noise only the men in the back row pretend not to mind, Layla waited after maghrib for the man whose name she had not written on paper when M had offered it. Ghassan came doubly tired: tired from the meeting where he had confessed he had a cousin problem, and tired from the knowledge that he would now have to walk through a door he had paid for but never imagined he would enter. He sat with her on the edge of a courtyard where a plant decided whether it would bloom this year or punish its owner for forgetting to speak kindly to it in spring.\n\n\u201cI am not your enemy,\u201d he said, surprising them both by choosing the simplest sentence a man can choose when he has been wrong. \u201cI am not your friend either, but I am a man you can place in a doorway and expect at least to ask who is entering.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will do more than ask,\u201d Layla said, and she did not soften the edge because his ring had already softened everything that needed gentling. \u201cYou will turn away men who borrow the Pavilion\u2019s name to get their boxes delivered faster. You will tell me before you tell your cousin when a foreign company dressed as a local one asks for our dirt beneath their rope. You will eat lunch in your office twice a week without guests until you learn what the room sounds like when it is not trying to sell you something.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are very domestic in your punishments,\u201d he muttered, and it might have been a complaint or an admiration. \u201cFine. I will be bored in the service of your virtue. But when you are tired of being virtuous, call me. I will take you somewhere vulgar and we will laugh at men who think their cars make them undrownable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have Yara for that,\u201d Layla said, and the man\u2019s laugh was honest, which boded well for his future under her stern wing.\n\nBy the time she reached the Palace, Riyadh had put on its night jewelry and decided to be forgiven for the heat of the day. The list on her desk had sprouted little ticks beside names; the bell lay quiet in its dish as if the falcon were asleep and dreaming of mice who apologized. Saffiyah leaned on the doorway and read a complaint on her phone about the Pavilion\u2019s \u201chostility to innovation\u201d from a man who had patented a recyclable napkin that dissolved when you needed it most. She read it in a voice that made Layla feel fourteen and safe and annoyed at once. Basim sent a photo of a little boy in a Messi shirt explaining to his grandmother that labels can lie, and the grandmother making a face that said she already knew and had been waiting for the world to catch up with her.\n\n\u201cAre you going to make a festival?\u201d Yara asked, dropping a handful of borrowed screws on the desk because leaving them in her pocket was how her washing machine had become an enemy. \u201cBecause everything in your head smells like tents and bad coffee and the good kind of noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Layla said, letting the picture grow out loud so it would be real. \u201cAn Open Bids Bazaar. Nothing polished. No velvet ropes. The vendors will sit on rugs and tell us what their products do and we will test them in front of everyone. We will have scales and magnifying glasses and children with stopwatches. We will pay for the things that admit their limitations; we will refuse the things that only admit their colors. We will buy the men doing small right work a kabsa and put their names on the screen. It will be a fair where the prize is a contract and the punishment is embarrassment that does not make me happy but does make us better.\u201d\n\nHessa nodded in the way she did when she saw her mother\u2019s hands in her niece\u2019s movements. She took a ribbon out of the drawer and cut it neatly in half with scissors that had never learned to lie. She tied one piece around the bell so it would tattle when anyone moved it; she tucked the other into her bag, because a woman can always use ribbon when she wants to be generous and dangerous in the same hour. The cat in the courtyard chose that moment to fling itself at a moth with more hope than skill. It missed in a spectacular fashion that made even Yara\u2019s mouth soften with admiration. The moth flew away to tell worse jokes. The cat licked its paw in a manner that said it had meant to do that.\n\nOn the roof, where the city\u2019s breath is a different tune than at street level, Layla lay flat and let the old concrete take her weight and pretend to be her mother. She did not talk at first because talking sometimes takes away strength and she wanted to hoard strength like a fruit that will not be in season next month. Yara sat cross-legged and and adjusted the small fan so it kissed Layla\u2019s face. The breeze was not a breeze so much as a truce between heat and night. It was a good truce, made in good faith.\n\n\u201cI am afraid,\u201d Layla said finally, the words not falling so much as making a place for themselves beside her. \u201cNot of the hawk. Not of the hand. Of becoming a story I cannot control and a woman I do not like. Of making my city into a mirror that reflects my ambition instead of the laylines beneath it that belong to people older and younger than me. Of waking and finding we have built something that looks beautiful and behaves cruel.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are afraid of being effective,\u201d Yara said lightly, which in her meant gently. \u201cThat is an honest fear. People who are not afraid of being effective are dangerous in the wrong direction. You are afraid and you are stubborn. We will use the fear as coolant and the stubbornness as an engine. We will rest on roofs and pray on mats and throw forks into flames until men stop selling us sugar that cannot rot.\u201d She stretched her legs, ballet-quiet, the way she always did when a day\u2019s fighting could be put down without being ashamed. \u201cAnd when you try a stupid plan, I will pull you back by your scarf and you will swear at me and I will accept the insult because I have earned it.\u201d\n\nLayla laughed and it didn\u2019t sound like a concession so much as an amen. The stars were cowry shells tonight if you tilted your head just so; the moon had chosen to keep its counsel. Somewhere far off, a siren sang for a reason that had nothing to do with her and everything to do with the kind of city that contained all the versions of a person in one block. She folded the day into a square as her grandmother had folded dishtowels and slid it into the drawer where she kept other days\u2019 edges. The wind moved and did not promise anything except to come back if the buildings made a path for it. In the morning, Riyadh would want to be persuaded again. That was the job. That was the joy.The day of the Bazaar arrived with the brightness of a new coin, the kind people turn over in their palms while pretending not to be charmed by it. The courtyard outside the Pavilion had shed its gala skin and put on a market\u2019s, rugs unfurled like patient carpets that remembered feet, poles strung with shade cloths in blues and browns that flattered the light instead of fighting it. The salvage yard Uncle arrived in a shirt ironed to the bravery of cotton, his hands empty and useful, and stood at the gate like a border marker that told everyone what kind of country they were entering. Girls from the university arrayed themselves behind a long table of clipboards and stopwatches and magnifying glasses as if about to perform a surgery on promises. Aunties from three neighborhoods came bearing Tupperware full of dates and sternness and the kind of laughter that can stitch a room closed when it tears. If a man had wanted to risk selling a lie here, he would have had to lower his eyes in a way that hurt.\n\nVendors pitched tents that made their products look like polite guests at a cousin\u2019s wedding. The small men with the stubborn inventions were early, unloading hose attachments and modular gaskets and filters with packaging that had been designed by an old neighbor rather than an agency. The glossy men came later, carrying cases that smelled faintly of airports and intent, their pitch rehearsed to land on the rhythm of applause. Yara\u2019s crew ghosted among them in slate and sand colors, all smiles and inventory tags, offering water and taking photographs of the insides of boxes in a way that looked like hospitality and functioned like audit. Tariq set his little sensors under tables and on the back legs of chairs as if they were invitations to a children\u2019s party that happened to keep their network clean.\n\nLayla had forgotten how much joy there is in arranging a room where people expect to be treated fairly. She stood at the entrance, shawl pinned with her grandmother\u2019s falcon bell turned into a brooch, and watched the city arrive with its elbows out and its eyes bright. She had imagined the day like a liturgy, rituals and call-and-response, and the plan slipped over the fact with gratifying snugness. The sorting station at the edge of the courtyard wore signs hand-lettered by the very serious girls from the university with jokes tucked under information like napkins under plates. A chalkboard read: If your product claims \u201ccompostable,\u201d please bring your own worms or borrow ours. Hessa sat at a wooden table with a bowl of lemons and a knife, performing the sacrament of slicing in an intimidatingly tidy fashion, because nothing was allowed to be sour unless it had been invited to be.\n\n\u201cBells?\u201d the salvage Uncle asked, nodding at Layla\u2019s brooch with the cautious admiration of a man who remembers the old rules and likes when the new ones include a familiar sound. \u201cYou plan to ring the good ones or the liars?\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth,\u201d Layla said, fastening a ribbon on the Uncle\u2019s wrist that would identify him as a judge to those who needed labels to respect a person. \u201cThe good ones get a bell on their booth to tell people how to find them next week. The liars get their bells rung in their ears right in front of everyone until they learn to at least lie in the direction of decency.\u201d\n\nBy ten, the courtyard throbbed with the kind of noise that means people think they are doing something together that will stick. The first demonstration belonged to a man who had spent five years inventing a valve that hiccupped at the exact right moment to save a liter of water every time someone washed their hands. He stood with his eyes in the safe middle distance people choose when they have already been laughed at by someone who didn\u2019t know how to listen. Layla asked him to show her the hiccup. He did, with a dignity that made the slight pause in the stream feel like a bow. The Auntie from Wadi Namar ran her palm under the water twice, nodded once, and declared in the voice of a woman telling a child to take his nap that this one could come to her daughter\u2019s house. The crowd clapped in the way that takes nothing away from a man who has earned it and gives him a little room inside his chest to breathe better.\n\nThe glossy men fared differently. A representative from a company that claimed to have redesigned trash bags out of algae delivered a speech that had clearly been designed to be delivered beside a waterfall. Layla dipped the bag in Tariq\u2019s makeshift vat; it stretched handsomely and then dissolved into a mucous defeat that made the front row gasp. \u201cSalt,\u201d she said mildly, stirring, \u201cis not a waterfall.\u201d The representative recovered gamely, promising a new formula in Q4 with quiet urgency, and a student with eyeliner like armor made a note on a card with three checkboxes: works now, feeds worms now, tells the truth now. She ticked none of them and wrote: pretty; try again.\n\nAt a corner table, an old man from Qassim with a quiet laugh presented bars of soap that had been formulated to lather with less water and rinse faster. He had brought his granddaughter to pour measured beakers of water over hands in front of a line of children so solemn Saffiyah threatened her mascara by grinning too widely. The soap did as promised, slipping off the skin with grace and leaving behind the smell of lemons and labor. Layla bought the entire case for the clinic at Wadi Laban without making a speech about it, which was its own speech.\n\nBy noon the Open Bids Bazaar had a hum that made the hair along Tariq\u2019s arm lift in that old way because the city was, for once, choosing its future in a way that requested his competence without demanding his adrenaline. The magnifying glasses found the microletters on a ribbon attached to a set of \u201csmart drains\u201d that claimed to detect oil, and those letters, when examined under the Aunties\u2019 collective patience, read H&H with a flourish it thought was modest. Layla did not toss the box into the kind of bin that men build for drama and call decisive; she untaped it neatly and made a small tower of its contents and used the power of ridicule sparingly because ridicule is a hard water that leaves a residue you spend years scrubbing off the room. She told the vendor he was welcome to stay and watch people test the competitors; she told the audience that a company that must hide its name in a place only a magnifying glass can see is a company not yet ready to be worthy of the work they are about to do. The vendor did not leave, which was encouraging; he asked for a glass of water and wrote down the name of the soap man with a face that said he would like to have grandchildren clap for him one day too.\n\nHessa announced a break in the testing with an authority that made even the wind adjust its angle. She passed out slices of lemon on a plate to make hands smell like kitchens instead of products, and offered every judge a date at the exact moment you might be tempted to be ungenerous. The football goalkeeper arrived in a fluster of teenage boys and aunties who had grown up watching him save reputations with the same elegance he saved shots. He signed the letter to the father who did not want to be the lone recycler on his street with a flourish that was almost a prayer, and when Layla pressed it into the man\u2019s palm two hours later, she watched his jaw find dignity again. He looked at her as if she had given him a favor he would not waste; he promised his daughter out loud, in the embarrassing tone of a father trying not to cry, that he would be the first to put the bottle in the right mouth every single day this week. The daughter rolled her eyes with love turned inside out and pretended to be unbothered while she slid the signed letter into a plastic sleeve like a talisman.\n\nThe envelope arrived the way bad ideas do at weddings\u2014too late to be stopped without making a scene and too early to be ignored. It tucked itself under a stack of vendor cards on Layla\u2019s table with the careful illegality of a man who has practiced this trick since his uncle taught him how to fold paper around cash so no one could smell it. Yara\u2019s hand landed on it before Layla\u2019s like a hawk\u2019s shadow before a jump. She did not whisk it away; she placed it in the exact center of the table with the patience of a teacher waiting for a child to decide whether he would choose honesty. The crowd felt the mood pivot the way a herd does when a rustle turns into a line in the grass. Basim sidled closer as if he had been propelled by a coincidence. Hessa set the lemon knife down and folded her hands, which was a sign to anyone who knew her that someone was about to be politely flayed.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d Layla said, the syllable the length of a single breath because she was a woman who had learned that brevity is a weapon you can use without blood. \u201cA gift.\u201d She did not open it privately because that had never been her sport. She asked for the Auntie with the sternest eyebrows to do the honor, which is a way to show a room who you believe has the right to be disappointed in you. The envelope had been sealed with an adhesive designed to be respectable and failed because it had been made by men who did not know the weather here. It peeled. Inside lay cash that tried to look like backup plans and a small card with a logo that had worn three names in two years. The card read, in the tone of a polite insult, For refreshments. The cash lay on the table like a confession from a child who did not yet know how to avoid adjectives. Layla looked at the audience, at the vendor table where men had suddenly remembered their shoes, at the ceiling of shade cloth that did not know it was witnessing joy yearn not to be injured by stupidity.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said in Arabic so clean even men who preferred English could find their way through it. \u201cWe do need refreshments. Our staff drinks water. Our volunteers eat dates. Our vendors are welcome to tea.\u201d She handed the envelope to Hessa, who decanted the cash into a clear jar with a theatrically labeled slot: Cash gifts for the flooring fund\u2014thank you for your contribution to our very boring and very necessary maintenance. The room laughed from their bellies because it felt good to watch a trick be made foolish in front of them. The vendor who had offered the envelope shifted and then straightened as if someone had put a spine in his shirt. He would survive, which was the desired outcome; people rarely change if you turn them into villains before giving them a chance.\n\nThe day almost made it through on the momentum of its honesty before the sabotage remembered its calendar. At half past three, when the heat had agreed to become merely parental instead of punitive, the generators feeding the vendor booths took a hiccup that was not the water-saving kind. The lights under the shade cloths stuttered; a projector trying to show a compost timeline decided to resurrect its screensaver of a beach that had never met a cigarette butt. Tariq\u2019s sensors chirped in that modest way good equipment has when it would like to inform you that your afternoon is about to change. He did not run, because running turns an irritation into a spectacle. He adjusted a plug in public and replaced a cable in private and followed the hiss of interference to a silver briefcase with the heft of false importance tucked under a chair near the tea. The briefcase was not bomb-smooth; it was a nest for a battery pack that had been told to misbehave at three-thirty and had done so with obedience that made Tariq scowl for its lack of imagination.\n\nSaffiyah, seeing the flicker in the light and the shift in the crowd\u2019s shoulders toward impatience, climbed on a chair and, with the ease of a woman who has been performing since she was twelve in living rooms with unkind lamps, announced a spontaneous contest to see which child could sort the contents of a mystery bin fastest with one hand tied to a friend\u2019s. It is hard to notice the temperature of the room when small people are cheering for banana peels to find their way home. The briefcase\u2019s battery sulked itself into useful again when Tariq showed it a picture of itself three minutes ago that he would later admit he had faked out of a petty joy at tricking something smug. The lights steadied. A girl in glitter sneakers beat three boys in a row while an old man from Diriyah took bets and made a killing in almonds. The moment that might have turned into muttering became a story, and stories stick when muttering does not.\n\nThe slickest lie of the day came wrapped in sincerity and a white polo shirt. A foundation no one in the room had heard of before this morning rolled in a cube on casters that wanted too much to be admired. It presented itself as a \u201chome micro-digester,\u201d a polite, sealed box that promised to eat food scraps without complaint and deliver liquid gold to your plants which would then thank you by growing obediently. Its spokeswomen had the earnest faces of people who believe a press release can make rain. They plugged the cube in and cooed at it and let it hum. Layla bent, not to smell the hum but to look underneath where people who design lies often forget to decorate. The drain line was capped and immaculate. The hum was manufactured. The cube did not have the weight of something that had eaten anything ever.\n\n\u201cMay I feed it something rude?\u201d Layla asked, smiling with every tooth. She took a handful of old bread that had been saved for this exact sacrament and broke it into the cube\u2019s mouth. The cube purred like a cat who wants peace and not accountability. She asked an Auntie to pour a cup of dishwater into the cube because she was feeling cruel. The spokeswomen\u2019s smiles trembled in the way of women who have been told by men that they can sell this anywhere because the world is full of distracted people. The dishwater pooled quietly under the cube without even having the decency to run with drama. The Aunties watched the pool expand as if admiring a henna pattern. The salvage Uncle chuckled in a way that made the sound carry farther than shouting would have. The spokeswomen attempted to unplug their miracle. Layla placed her foot gently on the cord.\n\n\u201cLeave it,\u201d she said, kindness wrapping the words because kindness is also a blade. \u201cWe will fix it for you. We will send you our notes. We will not buy it. But please come back when it can actually eat, and the women here will give you advice you cannot buy with any envelope.\u201d\n\nBy the time the shade had climbed the far wall and given mercy to the men who had been pretending they did not need it, the Bazaar had done the work Layla had asked of it. Children wore ribbons for being \u201chard to fool,\u201d a badge that sat on their chests with more pride than some diplomas; aunties compared notes on stickers as if on recipes; men with actual contracts to offer had mouthed thank you to Layla and meant it because the room had given them a way to say no to nonsense without making enemies at a cousin\u2019s dinner. A bell hung on three booths and a fourth in a man\u2019s hand because he had decided to spend his next free Friday at the salvage yard practicing apologies disguised as ingenuity.\n\nIn the soft mess after the crowd unbraided into roads and kitchens and air-conditioned indignations, Layla sat on the edge of a table and let her feet dangle like a girl who had brought a good report card home to a family that would clap and then ask what she learned, not what she scored. Yara came to lean one hip against the table, her clipboard now heavy with names that would find themselves either paid or waved at. Basim appeared with a print of a photograph he knew she would keep: a girl with her face set like a key turned at the correct angle, holding a stopwatch with both hands, her eyes on an aunt who was pouring exactly too fast on purpose.\n\n\u201cYou did not make it theater,\u201d Basim said, sounding almost disappointed and being secretly relieved. \u201cYou made it kitchen. With borrowed chairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cKitchen is where the city makes itself,\u201d Layla said, taking the photo and sliding it under the bell on her shawl to hold it down. \u201cTheater is where we convince ourselves we are already done.\u201d\n\nThey did not get to sit for long. Tariq\u2019s quiet machine ticked. The loop shivered, a dog shaking water from its coat. The hawk had tried another tug at the suppression system and found itself wrestling with a memory, grew annoyed and reckless, and pinged an IP that did not belong to its original room. Through the crack of that annoyance, in slipped the shape of a hub whose address had been a question since the first ding in the graph. Tariq held it like a fish you cradle in water to keep it breathing while you decide whether you will eat it. The packet came from Unit Q3 not at the Avaloran suite but from a floor below a coworking space where men with laptops and fragile opinions rented desk hours by the hour and called this stability. It ran through a private exchange that belonged to a man on Layla\u2019s list, one who had accepted soup and signed the sentence about supervisor signatures with a neatness that had made Yara suspicious.\n\n\u201cWe expected a pantry,\u201d Yara said, tapping the map Tariq had blossomed on her screen. \u201cWe have a broom closet instead. It is close. It is domestic. It believes itself overlooked.\u201d\n\n\u201cTonight?\u201d Tariq asked, a little too fast because he had smelled a door and doors are his favorite drug. \u201cTonight, we tuck it into bed and make it talk to us while it dreams.\u201d\n\n\u201cTonight we let it believe the house is empty,\u201d Layla said, feeling the tug-of-war between impatience and discipline draw old lines in her shoulders. \u201cWe will visit at fajr, when the city is better-mannered and the men who sleep poorly have gone home to pretend they have slept at all. Bring a screwdriver that believes in persuasion. Bring nothing else you cannot throw into a potted plant if someone surprises you.\u201d\n\nOn the way to the car, a man in a white polo shirt with a logo that had been designed to resemble nothing and therefore look expensive stepped into Layla\u2019s path with the respectful belligerence of a person who believes women owe him their time because he has learned how to shave without cutting himself. He introduced himself as the director of a foundation dedicated to \u201cdisruption in household practices.\u201d He used the word disruption like a toothpick. He said he had been extremely impressed by the Bazaar and wished to fund the next one with the understanding that \u201ccertain vendors\u201d would be \u201cplaced in highly visible positions\u201d on the field. He said the word field as if he were describing a polo match.\n\n\u201cYou may fund the bathrooms,\u201d Layla said, smiling with sufficient warmth to keep it civil. \u201cThey need good lights and better drains. If you write me a check for both, your logo can appear near the sink with a sentence that says you understand the difference between hygiene and disruption. If you prefer something that photographs better, we are not the people you should marry.\u201d\n\nThe man blinked twice like a lizard adjusting. He said he would \u201ccircle back.\u201d She said she would be exactly where he found her now\u2014annoying and asked for too much and not going away.\n\nAt home the house had scrapes on its shins from a day of being useful. Hessa set tea on the table with the sigh people make when their body is tired and their mind will not be for another hour. Saffiyah told a story about a child who had taken the confetti from the smart label and made it into a wedding for a beetle under a chair, and Layla laughed until she had to wipe her eyes with the hem of her own sleeve like a person without servants. Yara laid out the map of the building with the broom closet and used salt grains to mark the cameras that lied to themselves and lentil husks to mark the door that stuck every time a man heavier than his job tried to go through it. Tariq cupped his hands around his tea as if it were an ear.\n\nBasim sent a photograph without words: Mireille at a balcony that had not learned modesty, holding a wineglass that was the wrong color for the outfit and therefore the only honest thing about the picture. The caption posted by someone else beneath it read, in French that tried too hard not to be rude, that Avalora\u2019s Princess admired the bravery of Saudi\u2019s \u201csustainability spectacle.\u201d Layla did not reply to Basim because there was nothing to say that would be new. She forwarded the picture to no one and asked God for the gift of not minding metaphors when your hands are covered in the glue of logistics.\n\nThey slept a blessed hour like soldiers in a house at peace, shoes near, hair braided. At the call to fajr, the city opened its eyes and yawned tenderness into its streets. They moved like reflections down the quiet corridors of the coworking building where chairs dreamed of posture and chargers coiled like small serpents around desk legs. The broom closet door wore two locks for show and one for loyalty. Yara handled the show; Layla whispered to the loyalty with her hairpin until it agreed to let them be the exception that proves nothing.\n\nInside, the closet was less tidy than the data would have liked to pretend. A slim case hummed to itself, the hawk\u2019s old arrogance scratched by a hand that did not like being careful. Taped to the wall, a paper like the one Yara had pulled from the driver\u2019s van bore the hand-scrawled note in English, because men always love to be international when misbehaving: Q3 mirror. Do not disconnect unless told by G. The letter G had been written with pressure that put the tip of the pen through the paper because softness is not a talent men who like being obeyed practice.\n\n\u201cGhassan?\u201d Tariq asked, scandalized not by the possibility but by the initial\u2019s lack of creativity.\n\n\u201cGhassan,\u201d Layla said, not relieved, not shocked, the mild sadness of discovering that someone you had applauded for admitting tiredness had decided to take a nap on a line you had told him not to cross. \u201cOr the man who wants me to think Ghassan. Or the God you believe you are when you reinvent routing tables without supervision. It doesn\u2019t matter for this room. We will make it honest.\u201d\n\nThey did not unplug the box. Tariq sat cross-legged on the floor and pulled from his bag a device that looked humble\u2014a lunchbox, a recurrence of kitchen\u2014opened it, and revealed the small polite teeth of a tap. He installed it upstream of the hawk\u2019s mouth and gave it a memory as gentle and persistent as an aunt\u2019s voice, a thing that says, over and over, we see you, we hear you, we are writing the minutes of this meeting. Yara resecured the door with a small wedge under the hinge that would tell her, by the posture of the floor\u2019s squeak, if someone had opened it after they left. Layla looked for a pen and wrote on the paper under G\u2019s demand a sentence in her grandmother\u2019s careful script: Please call your mother.\n\nOn the way out, at the stairwell, a man in an ill-considered suit leaned against the railing with the posture of someone who has stayed too long at a party where nobody knows his favorite song. He had the bruise a tailor cannot cover without insult and the eyes of a person who has misunderstood who the enemy is. He said, in English because he had learned to be brave in that language, that Layla should stop embarrassing men who \u201cmean well.\u201d She said, in Arabic because that is how you scold with intimacy, that men who mean well and then choose ease over decency are the river that wears away a city more surely than any drought. He moved his mouth as if he might say her name like a weapon. Yara stepped slightly to the right and the man remembered his teeth and how much better they felt when inside his own mouth.\n\nBy eight, the city was stirring itself into traffic and office chairs. By nine, the Pavilion\u2019s fountains performed their quiet show for a class of children whose teacher had asked them in the bus to think of three ways to be boring heroes at home. By ten, a video of Layla opening an envelope in public and putting cash into a clear jar had been sliced by men in a building with a logo that resembled a cloud into something that suggested she was accepting bribes and grinning. By ten-fifteen, Basim had posted the entire eight minutes in which the Aunties rolled their eyes in unison, which is a diplomat\u2019s nightmare because no government wants to be on the other side of Auntie eyes, and the cut lost its sharpness like sugar left out all night. By noon, Ghassan texted a single word that could be a confession or a plea: Talk.\n\nIn the afternoon, while the air made a pilgrimage back to the ground and Layla let herself sit for the space of a tea\u2019s cool-down, a boy from the clinic arrived with a drawing. It was of a tank on a roof with a monster inside, tongue out, being poked by a lady with a hairpin. The lady looked twice as tall as the tank and had a bell on her scarf. Underneath he had written in square letters his teacher would refuse to correct: Thank you for the trick. She pinned it to the wall above her desk with the falcon bell, where the ring would remind her to laugh at least once even when the next trick arrived with a bow and a name she could not yet say out loud.\n\nToward evening, Riyadh put its shoulder under the day one last time and pushed. A message came from M that said, in a tone that knew how to be a compliment without sincerity eroding it, that the Bazaar had been a lesson. \u201cYou are better on rugs than carpets,\u201d it read. \u201cI have made a note. Return the bell if you ever tire of the sound it makes.\u201d Layla considered crafting an elegant reply and instead sent back a photograph of a boy holding a stopwatch and a woman cutting lemons, a vocabulary M would understand even if she had never learned to speak it. Then she turned her phone facedown and went to the roof with a bowl of pistachios because you must feed victory and worry the same snacks or else they become jealous.\n\n\u201cTomorrow we make the bathroom lights better,\u201d she said, when Yara joined her with the kind of quiet that makes a body believe it has a second wind in it somewhere. \u201cIt is not glorious, which is why we will be good at it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow we call mothers,\u201d Yara said, which seemed, as always, both solution and metaphor. \u201cAnd we ring bells, not to shame, but to remind.\u201d\n\n\u201cShame is useful only when it retires quickly,\u201d Layla said, cracking a pistachio with the ease of someone born with patient fingers. The city breathed. The bell above her desk winked from its new perch in the window. Somewhere, in a broom closet with a note that had not expected a reply, a little device told the truth to a recorder and did not know it was doing something holy. Somewhere, in a room with the wrong color of wine, a woman in white crossed out a line on a list and wrote another with a pen that had been sharpened to an unkind point. Somewhere in between, which is where all the interesting work happens, men texted cousins they had decided to disappoint and women laid out rugs for a gathering next week where they would bring lemons and knives and make a kitchen out of another room that had forgotten that was what it was for.",

                              "content": "In the last hour before sunrise, Riyadh holds its breath. The tall glass spines of the financial district dim to ink, and the ancient wind from the dunes slips between new towers and old courtyards like a whisper no one can quite catch. On the roof of a whitewashed villa rimmed with bougainvillea, a woman in a pale gray abaya leapt the gap between two buildings with a soft thump that did not wake the sleeping lights below.\n\nShe rolled, rose, and laughed under her breath. The city\u2019s dawn was a ribbon of violet, and the muezzin\u2019s first syllable pressed the sky like a thumb to silk. Layla bint Saad had slept four hours and would not sleep again for sixteen. It was not a complaint. It wasn\u2019t even unusual. As a girl she had peeled figs with her nails and undone locks with clips; as a student she had traced calligraphy for hours until her wrist trembled; as a princess she had learned that teeth are better bared in smiles until bite is needed. These things were all part of the same\u2014what had she called it to her sisters? That set of skills she had practiced in secret while the palace believed she collected perfumes and poetry. \u201cParticular,\u201d she had said then. \u201cPartcilar,\u201d Saffiyah had echoed as a tease, making herself small in the closet while Layla practiced picking a combination safe with her eyes closed.\n\nShe was, after all, the kind of princess who kept maps of air vents folded in the drawer where jewels might wait. The kind who could slip in and out of a building as neatly as writing her name.\n\nShe crouched at the roof\u2019s edge, balancing on the balls of her feet, and blinked down into the alley. The last of the stray cats had slunk off, and a dust-cart trundled past like it had always been a trundler\u2014never fast, never slow. Across the street, in the courtyard where fig trees drooped over a string hammock, a housekeeper hung socks on a line with wooden clips. Layla could smell coffee somewhere. She was bored of screens and excited by problems. That was her trouble.\n\nFootfalls creaked on the stair behind her. She did not turn until she had counted three steps and knew by the weight of the sound that it was her. Hessa, her aunt, Hessa of the folded arms and the watchful eyes.\n\n\u201cYour Highness,\u201d Hessa said, barely suppressing the smile the name always coaxed. \u201cYou are going to break my heart with your madness.\u201d\n\nLayla wiped a smear of grit off her cheek with the back of her hand. \u201cAuntie, you forget. Highnesses descend staircases; I prefer roofs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen marry a roof,\u201d Hessa snorted, and her perfume\u2014green fig and something like new paper\u2014drifted up with the pre-dawn breeze. \u201cIt will be faithful to you. Go pray before you do another stupid thing. The cars will be here in an hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Pavilion starts at nine, yes,\u201d Layla said, vaulting down to the terrace with a neat grace that made the guards on the next roof exchange glances they thought she did not see. \u201cI want to check the maintenance logs before the ministers arrive.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to climb into ducts,\u201d Hessa said. \u201cYour father asked me to remind you what time it is, Layla.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the hour in which the desert listens,\u201d Layla said, and for once Hessa did not roll her eyes. Half the time Layla\u2019s poetry was a shield. But this morning she felt it like a weight on her ribs\u2014cool and pleasant and necessary.\n\nShe made her wudu and prayed. The tiled floor was cool under her forehead. The first slice of light illuminated the calligraphy carved above the arch: God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. She rose with the amen quiet in her mouth like a mint.\n\nAt breakfast the palace was soft with the sound of plates and the sand hiss in the garden as the irrigation flickered on. Saffiyah sat cross-legged on the cushion with a bowl of olives and jam, nimble-fingered as ever, peeling the skin off a single grape like an old woman searching a thread. Yara\u2014bodyguard, driver, the world\u2019s gentlest liar\u2014stood behind Layla\u2019s chair like a shadow that had decided to be helpful. On the far wall the screens murmured headlines to no one, cycling through currencies and weather maps and an upbeat feature about a turtle rescue near Jeddah.\n\n\u201cDid you see the guest list?\u201d Saffiyah asked, plunking the tiny naked grape on a cracker as if it were a jewel in a crown. \u201cI know you did. I\u2019m asking because I want to gossip in front of Auntie Hessa, who hates gossip.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not hate gossip,\u201d Hessa said, buttering bread. \u201cI hate slander. Gossip is an art that should be practiced with skill and restraint.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a desalination plant that runs on sun and math,\u201d Layla said, still smiling. \u201cAnd you want to discuss\u2026?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe foreign princess,\u201d Saffiyah said, widening her eyes as if invoking a ghost. \u201cPrincess Mira\u2026 something. Myr? Like the scent? Mirae? I saw her on a yacht in Greece last summer\u2014on a screen, I mean\u2014and she had a dog in a hat. Two hats, actually. The dog, I mean. Both heads.\u201d\n\n\u201cA mutt with a double brain,\u201d Yara murmured.\n\n\u201cMireille,\u201d Hessa said. \u201cMireille of Avalora.\u201d She made the name sound like porcelain. \u201cHer family invests in packaging. This is what is said.\u201d\n\n\u201cPackaging,\u201d Saffiyah said cheerfully. \u201cBoxes for boxes. She does not recycle. That is what is also said.\u201d\n\nLayla chewed her bread slowly. \u201cNobody recycles perfectly,\u201d she said, hearing in her own voice the cautious tone she used when slowing a car on black ice. \u201cIt is a hard thing to do well. Systems are complicated. People break rules because rules break them first.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe once threw a bag of mixed trash on a beach and told her assistant to blame the locals,\u201d Saffiyah said, undeterred. \u201cA friend of a friend saw. I\u2019m not pretending everyone is a saint. I\u2019m just saying\u2014be careful. She is beautiful like a wineglass, and sharp like the same.\u201d\n\nLayla\u2019s phone vibrated twice. She glanced. Tariq\u2019s name blinked on the screen with its little lightning bolt emoji because he always arrived like weather. She let herself grin and then pressed the smile back down. \u201cI will be careful,\u201d she said to Hessa as if that settled everything. \u201cAnd I want to check the Pavilion\u2019s waste sorting before anyone touches it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course you do,\u201d Hessa said. \u201cWear something with pockets.\u201d\n\nThe Desert Bloom Pavilion rose like a mirage out of the glass and white stone of the King Abdullah Financial District, all honeycomb shade and sloping desert grasses that had not seen rain in a decade but were green anyway. Solar wings unfurled like a hawk\u2019s, and beneath them the air hummed. In the pool at the entrance, a silver sculpture of an oryx stood with its horn tipped to the sunlight in a way that made every camera phone wish for it.\n\nLayla walked with purpose between the columns. Her abaya today was dove gray with a quiet hexagon pattern that echoed the Pavilion\u2019s honeycomb. The two ministers at her side talked in parabolic sentences that bounced off the ceiling and returned to them unchanged. She nodded when needed, smiled when needed, and when the three of them reached the service corridor, she excused herself with a small bow to the men and to the camera clicking behind them and slipped left.\n\n\u201cBoss,\u201d Tariq said, popping up from a crouch beneath a panel he had no business being inside. He wore a t-shirt that said GREEN INK in smeared letters and had a smear of actual green on his cheek as if the shirt had fought back. He looked like a man who had slept under a desk and loved it. \u201cCongratulations on inventing the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not invent it,\u201d Layla said, kneeling to peer into the panel with him. \u201cI just herded six hundred people until they moved in the same direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is the same thing,\u201d Tariq said. His eyes shone. He handed her a small device shaped like a coin. \u201cWe found this stuck to the feed line.\u201d\n\nLayla held it delicately between her fingers. A transmitter, flat. Not uncommon, but unusual here. She turned it over. \u201cPower?\u201d\n\n\u201cBattery,\u201d Tariq said, tapping a schematic on his tablet with a stylus held in a ringed hand. \u201cEncrypted. Probably just data scraping. It\u2019s listening.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo what?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo everything,\u201d he said, trying not to enjoy the drama too much and therefore enjoying it twice as much. \u201cPressure, output, the time you take between blinks, everything. It might be benign. It might be the new normal\u2014everything listening, everything telling secrets to something with a server farm in a far country.\u201d\n\n\u201cFind the rest,\u201d Layla said. \u201cGo soft-foot. And keep my name out of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want me to ghost the minister and mention it in passing?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon't mention it,\u201d she said, and smiled at the way his shoulders loosened at the permission to be clever without witnesses. \u201cNot yet. What\u2019s the waste sort?\u201d\n\nTariq grinned as if she had asked him about a dog that did tricks. \u201cWe have optical scanners, as you ordered, and we taught them to fall in love with PET like it\u2019s a romance novel. The gray water is cycling. The compost worms are sleepy but willing. There\u2019s a kink at the step where people dump their tray. They need to be taught twice. It\u2019s always two. First, the polite sign. Second, the gentle human hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll provide the hand,\u201d Layla said, sliding the transmitter into a pocket she had sewn into the abaya herself, right above the lining where it would sit quiet and not click against anything. It made her feel twelve and triumphant to have a pocket no one else knew about.\n\nBack in the main hall, the sound had sharpened. A dozen staff rehearsed their routines in the multipurpose lobby: where to stand, how to smile, when to sweep away a glass without announcing the act. A musician tuned a oud, and the notes curved back into the metal bones of the building like swallows circling home. The screens above the circular dais cycled through clean data: the rate at which light sketched water out of brine, the CO2 offset with numbers big enough to make ministers clap. Layla loved it. She loved it so much her throat ached.\n\n\u201cYou are early, Amira,\u201d Basim the journalist said, stepping into her shadow as if it belonged to him. He had a camera that weighed too much and a grin that weighed nothing. She tolerated Basim because he never used her title when recording interviews, only in private, and because he had an eye for the kind of photograph that made people tear up in airplanes.\n\n\u201cI live here,\u201d she said. \u201cShall I give you a tour you will pretend to have discovered yourself?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have ink on your face,\u201d he said, deadpan.\n\nShe wiped nothing and looked at him until he laughed. \u201cThe foreign royals land in twenty. You know she is coming,\u201d he said, little brother voice. \u201cMireille. Your friend who loves trash. Rumor says she will throw a bottle under your nose and smile at you. Rumor says this is what she does. Provokes.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is not my friend,\u201d Layla said, more to the air than to him. \u201cAnd if she throws a bottle, we will make a lesson on the spot.\u201d\n\nBasim\u2019s grin curled in appreciation. \u201cAh, a performance. Riyadh will trend for the right reasons again. I adore you for this, Layla.\u201d\n\nShe handed him a badge, because Basim liked to pretend he snuck into everything but actually craved order like a cat craved sun patches. \u201cTrend me gently, Basim.\u201d\n\nThe limousine procession snaked in at nine, and plants in the atrium rustled to see if they would be photographed. Layla stood at the foot of the dais and shook seven hands that had gripped seven different kinds of power. Ministers, investors, young students with eyes like sparklers. She smiled for each one, and the smile was not fake. It was a strategy that had become honest through practice.\n\nThree seconds of hush before the next wave and then the foreign princess arrived.\n\nMireille of Avalora didn\u2019t so much walk as proceed. She wore white without apology and had the posture of a swan that had won a lawsuit. Her hair was a perfect compromise between easy and engineered. The cameras loved her because she offered them angles and a little bite. She did not announce anything except money. Layla saw her hands first. They were slender and idle, and the nails were chaste, no chips. The woman\u2019s gaze slid to Layla, landed, assessed, and stayed. Layla lifted her chin a degree. Suddenly there was a bad taste on her tongue that had nothing to do with coffee.\n\n\u201cYour Kingdom is kind,\u201d Mireille said. Her voice was a bell that had been iced. \u201cAnd very modern.\u201d\n\n\u201cKindness and modernity are not enemies,\u201d Layla said. \u201cWelcome.\u201d\n\nMireille\u2019s gaze flicked over the solar wings, then to the composting garden in its neat glass case, the rows of white trays with color-coded slots. \u201cVery tidy,\u201d Mireille said, and took the water bottle offered by her aide. She drank the whole thing in four dainty swallows, tilted her head, then let the empty bottle dangle in one hand like a chandelier. The cameras leaned in, hungry.\n\n\u201cRecycle, please,\u201d Layla said, and pointed to the slot with the PET icon and the little goat eating a tin can with a red slash over it, an illustration Tariq had insisted would charm the merciless. \u201cBlue.\u201d\n\nMireille blinked. The corner of her mouth ticked.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d she said, helplessly. \u201cI never remember.\u201d\n\nHer aide reached for the bottle. \u201cGive it,\u201d Layla said\u2014lightly. One syllable that drew a small circle around the aide\u2019s wrist. The aide froze, then handed the bottle to the princess it belonged to.\n\n\u201cThis is where it goes,\u201d Layla said, not smiling, not scolding. She made the motion for the cameras, for the students standing just beyond the rope, for herself. Blue slot. Clink. Done.\n\nMireille held her gaze for a three-count and then dropped the bottle into the general waste. The room gasped with the intimacy of it, like someone had slapped a lover in public and smiled at the same time. Basim\u2019s camera clicked. Yara\u2019s fingers tightened around nothing. Layla\u2019s teeth found her own cheek and marked it.\n\n\u201cOops,\u201d Mireille said. \u201cI\u2019m sure it ends up in the same place, darling.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Layla said, easy. \u201cIt does not. We built this to make different places.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh? Then I am impressed,\u201d Mireille said lightly, and leaned in. Her perfume was citrus and unblinking. \u201cBut truly, people who don\u2019t have time don\u2019t have time. Busy women with seven meetings? You understand. We must save our attention for\u2026 significant things.\u201d\n\n\u201cWaste is significant,\u201d Layla said. \u201cBecause one day we run out of later.\u201d\n\nMireille\u2019s smile deepened. \u201cI never do,\u201d she said. Then, to the cameras, brighter, the actress stepping into the light: \u201cCongratulations to our hosts! It is good to be in a city that wants to lead.\u201d\n\nSmall change in the air\u2014like a coin flipped over and over to hide which face will be heads. Layla had the oddest impulse to laugh, because how ridiculous, to be in a public game with a woman whose only sin (so far) was the refusal to use a blue slot like a good child. But there was something else under it. A hum. Tariq\u2019s transmitter against her hip felt warmer than metal should. She shifted, and it was only the friction against the lining.\n\nShe walked the party through their paces. Minister this, CEO that, student with a question that made her heart lift because it was so earnest it was brave. All the while the camera\u2019s attention slid to the white swan princess in the white dress whose smile was like pomegranate pith. Mireille did not lift a finger to help anyone sort anything. Once, when a young girl in a lavender hijab hesitated at the organic bin, Mireille took her tray and dumped everything in one motion into the black-lined container labeled WASTE. The girl stared. No one said anything. Layla felt something hot coil under her ribs like a spring.\n\nAt noon, a glitch appeared on the screen. It was so small it would have been nothing if the eyes on the numbers had been dull. But Layla never let her eyes be dull. She saw the line flicker in the water output graph\u2014just a twitch, a little muscle memory of error. It righted itself. Tariq\u2019s text zipped across her screen a breath later: see the tick? She didn\u2019t reply. She smiled at a senator from an island country who smelled like salt and fear.\n\nThe glitch hiccuped again. Then the coffee bar overflowed foam into someone\u2019s handbag with a delighted hush; the barista cursed softly into his beard; the video screen smoothed out the line again. Someone had done something clever. Or something dumb had been given permission to play. Layla knew the feeling too well. It wasn\u2019t sabotage yet. It wasn\u2019t anything except the whisper before. The Pavilion went on. Tours flowed. Filters sang.\n\nShe stole five minutes and a door. In the service corridor she used her grandmother\u2019s hairpin to rake a lock she could have opened with a key if she had asked the right man. She preferred the hairpin today. It gave her secret joy. The panel opened. The belly of the building sighed at her. Warmth and whir of water. She breathed and listened.\n\nUnder her breath she recited the technician\u2019s map she had memorized at three in the morning while Saffiyah snored with astonishing innocence on the sofa beside her. Two pipes meet, turn. The third is the redundancy line. If there is a foreign object. If there is misreporting. If. If. The little coin device in her pocket seemed heavier than its grams.\n\n\u201cAmira?\u201d Yara\u2019s voice behind her, soft as a cushion that had decided to warn. \u201cYou have three minutes. They are gathering for the ribbon.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell Hessa to cut it,\u201d Layla said. \u201cShe likes cutting.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou like knots,\u201d Yara said. She crouched beside her, glanced in as if the tangle of pipes might misbehave at the sight of their faces. \u201cI saw her,\u201d Yara added, and Layla did not have to ask who she meant.\n\n\u201cMireille.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe looks like she bites.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe looks like she doesn\u2019t finish things,\u201d Layla said, and Yara\u2019s huff might have been a laugh if you were feeling generous.\n\nThey closed the panel. Layla returned to the stage where a ribbon shone like a vein. She stood beside a minister whose tie had been chosen by a cousin. Cameras winked. Basim caught her eye over a bouquet, and she tilted her head a fraction, a silent, Not yet. He nodded, and his hand stilled on the shutter.\n\nThe ribbon parted. The cheer rose. The air smelled like metal warmed by sun and oud and joy. The Pavilion exhaled, like a thing that knows it is alive. Layla exhaled with it. The graph did not flicker. Her phone stayed mute.\n\nWhen trouble came, it came sideways.\n\nAt the waste stations, where people lined up to perform their morning\u2019s virtue with their trays and their banana peels and their crumpled napkins, the scanners began to stutter. Blue light meant plastic. Green meant compost. Red meant error. Red began to strobe. Polite signs became not enough. Staff stepped in with the gentle hands she had promised and met the shrug of the very dignified and the smirk of the expensive. Someone took a video; someone captioned it with a joke. The Pavilion\u2019s hashtag morphed a degree into a word that meant a much smaller compliment. It was not a disaster. But Layla had learned that public faith is a thin, thirsty grass, and a boot heel is heavy.\n\nTariq materialized at her elbow, breathless, smelling like adrenaline which smells like pennies. \u201cWe found three more,\u201d he said. \u201cAll in the gray spaces. All listening.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo they talk?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey chirp,\u201d he said. \u201cLike gossiping sparrows. We can jam them, but then we jam ourselves. Better to feed them what we want them to eat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen feed,\u201d Layla said. \u201cGive them a feast of lies. Tell them the compost is made of gold. Tell them we drink the wastewater at brunch.\u201d\n\nHe snorted. \u201cDone. Also\u2026 the source point.\u201d\n\n\u201cShow me,\u201d she said, and he showed her a tag on the code\u2014a tiny flourish in the encryption, something like a signature if you had the arrogance to sign your spywork. It wasn\u2019t a name, exactly. It was an old Avaloran icon for a hawk and a hand.\n\n\u201cMireille,\u201d Basim said, appearing as if he had walked out of the wall. He was not supposed to be in this corridor. He was always where he shouldn\u2019t be. \u201cOr someone who wants us to think Mireille. Will you accuse her? It will be\u2026 delicious.\u201d\n\nLayla closed her eyes for a second and saw white like a gull. She opened them. \u201cNo. Not delicious. Not yet. We do not know. And I won\u2019t make our Pavilion into a theater of petty slaps. We will know first. Then, we will act.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want a villain you can hold in your hands,\u201d Basim said softly. \u201cThat is reasonable. And sometimes a luxury.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are no villains,\u201d Layla said. \u201cOnly people who choose again and again to forget what matters.\u201d She thought of the bottle dropping into the wrong mouth and made herself breathe until it became a story she had watched instead of a thing she had felt.\n\nMireille found her at the end of the day by the garden where the succulent leaves lifted their fat faces to the light like children. The party had thinned; the cameras had wandered off to the luncheon; even Hessa had let herself sit for five minutes on a bench and stare at the sky as if she had never seen blue before. Mireille stood without a shadow, because she had learned long ago how to angle against the sun.\n\n\u201cYour little machines don\u2019t like my friends,\u201d she said, as though they were intimate enough to share secrets. \u201cPoor things. So fussy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey work beautifully,\u201d Layla said. \u201cPeople are complicated. Machines simply mirror.\u201d\n\n\u201cHm,\u201d Mireille said, tasting the sound. \u201cMirrors, yes. That\u2019s why I avoid them.\u201d She leaned in. The citrus of her perfume sharpened to something like rind scraped on metal. \u201cYou do not frighten me,\u201d she said almost too quietly for anything but Layla to hear. \u201cYour city\u2019s tidy story does not frighten me either. I am not a villain in your tale.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not cast you,\u201d Layla said. \u201cYou auditioned.\u201d\n\nMireille laughed\u2014slow, small, amused with something else in it. Then she leaned past Layla and plucked a glossy green leaf off a plant with a casual thumb and forefinger. She let it fall. \u201cGardening is not my art,\u201d she said. \u201cI prefer\u2026 poisons.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you do recycle,\u201d Layla said. \u201cThreats. From a decade ago.\u201d\n\nMireille\u2019s eyes glittered. \u201cDarling,\u201d she said softly. \u201cMy only threat is that I will always have more time than you. So I do not need to sort my trash, or my men, or my enemies. The world does it for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d Layla said, because she could not help herself, \u201cand yet here you are, sorting your words like plastic.\u201d\n\nYara cleared her throat behind Layla with the quiet that meant leave now. Somewhere in the building something whirred twice that should have whirred once. Basim\u2019s camera clicked though he appeared to be photographing a plant. Hessa\u2019s voice rolled down the hall with a mother\u2019s calm that meant someone somewhere should be afraid. The Pavilion inhaled, the city exhaled.\n\nIn the car on the way back to the palace, Layla watched the sky turned to a bruise-blue ahead of dusk. She let her head fall back against the seat. Yara turned the air a degree cooler, then back again, then left it alone because she had been with Layla long enough to know that too much comfort made her itch.\n\n\u201cWhat do we know?\u201d Yara asked.\n\n\u201cThat we are not imagining it,\u201d Layla said. \u201cThat someone is listening. That they want us embarrassed, not broken. Yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the foreign princess who thinks recycling is beneath her?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat she likes theater,\u201d Layla said. \u201cThat she learned long ago that if she makes people feel small they will carry her across puddles. And that she underestimates the weight of one empty bottle when the right hands pick it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhose hands?\u201d Yara asked.\n\n\u201cMine,\u201d Layla said, and felt the pocket\u2019s small coin like a heartbeat.\n\nAt home, the garden had warmed sumac and jasmine until the night smelled like tea. Hessa sat with her shoes off on the steps and a glass of mint water sweating rings on the stone. \u201cWell?\u201d she asked. She did not need a preface.\n\n\u201cIt went,\u201d Layla said. \u201cThe way things go the first day when the world is watching and a flock of little birds pecks at your seeds. We are fine. We will be better. I want to look at vendor lists at nine. Come if you like puzzles. Bring reading glasses.\u201d\n\nHessa grunted. \u201cSaffiyah would make us dinner, but she burned something and cried because the onion made her feel deep emotion like an opera. I ordered.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is my favorite flavor,\u201d Layla said. \u201cDelivered.\u201d\n\nThey ate sitting on the floor because chairs felt like too much. Tariq arrived like weather\u2014with thundercloud hair and sparrow hands and five small devices in a pouch that kept him awake with their almost song. Basim texted pictures that made the Pavilion look like a poem written by an engineer who loved birds. Yara slipped in and out, and no one noticed when she did because that was her super-power.\n\nAfter midnight, the palace fell into the sound a city house makes when all the people inside are sleeping and the pipes are whispering to each other. Layla did not sleep. She sat at her white desk with a desert map and a spreadsheet and the little coin device disassembled into a tidy fan of parts. She touched each piece once with a fingertip as if it were a talisman. One transistor, two. The battery that pretended to be small and wanted to be large. The case that expected to be thrown away after it had betrayed its secret. She looked up the vendor prefix in an old list that was not the official one, because the official one lied. The prefix belonged to a parent company that had three names and a favorite hobby of changing them. She chased it the way a falcon chases a flicker at the edge of its sight. Into a paper company in Nice. Into a paper company in Manama. Into a shell on a shelf in Avalora with a hawk on its crest that smiled when you were not.\n\nHer phone, face down, vibrated. A single message from an unknown number: Good show today. The desert always forgives waste. We should talk. There was a name. M.\n\nLayla set the phone on the desk and considered the letter the way one considers a trap that has baited itself. Then she turned it off and put it in the drawer beside her grandmother\u2019s hairpins.\n\nThe next morning would bring committees, and classes, and the thousand tiny cuts of governance. The next morning would bring apologies disguised as questions. The next morning would bring all the polite little wars that modern cities fight with napkins and logos and metrics.\n\nBefore she turned out the lamp, she walked barefoot to the roof. The stars were a prayer rug. Riyadh\u2019s breath went in and out, in and out. From here, the desert looked like it might be persuaded to become anything. She put her hands on the warm concrete and felt the hum of the building beneath. It hummed back. She could imagine a future in which waste was a story her children did not understand. She could also imagine a woman in white who never said sorry because no one had asked her to mean it.\n\nYara came up with a blanket and didn\u2019t ask if she wanted it. She lay down beside Layla with the ease of a long friendship and looked at the same nothing held everything. \u201cAre you going to fight her?\u201d Yara asked, both curious and resigned to whatever answer would come.\n\n\u201cNot her,\u201d Layla said. \u201cNot a person. A habit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is harder,\u201d Yara said.\n\n\u201cI have a partcilar set of skills,\u201d Layla said, smiling into the dark. \u201cWe will use them on habits.\u201d\n\n\u201cWake me when you need to be pulled out of a stupid plan,\u201d Yara murmured, already half-asleep on the warm concrete.\n\nLayla closed her eyes. The city was all around her, the sound of it like the sea. From somewhere not far off, a stray cat yowled at the moon in a language of complaint that was older than maps. Layla slept like a soldier does, one ear awake, the other dreaming of water turned to light and back again.\n\nIn the morning, there would be another bottle. Another choice. Another tiny hinge on which the door of everything might swing. Her hands itched\u2014not for jewels, not for ribbons\u2014but for locks and circuits and the soft push of persuasion. She would sort the trash that was people\u2019s fear and the trash that was their comfort. She would go to work. And in the far-off rooms of a foreign palace, a woman in white would wake to find that someone had made a list of everything she threw away.",

Layla woke before her alarm with the dry knowledge of tasks stacked like plates, each one slightly damp around the edges. She lay still for a moment and let the call to prayer wash through the room, low and steady like a river you couldn\u2019t see but always trusted was there. The ache along her forearms that came from crawling too far under equipment and too fast across roofs was pleasant, a ledger of effort she did not mind paying. When she sat up, the little coin of a transmitter lay on the desk where she had disassembled it, cured into quiet with its secrets temporarily unstrung. She wanted to pick it up again, to spin the battery between finger and thumb like a coin toss, but instead she stood, made wudu, and let the floor cool her forehead while she told God the truth: that patience was a craft she had not yet mastered, and humility a dress she wore only on some days.\n\nHessa appeared at breakfast wrapped in a soft shawl that had once belonged to Layla\u2019s grandmother, the weave too fine for the way Hessa used it to blot her tea cups. \u201cWe start with vendors at nine,\u201d she said without greeting, as if they had already been mid-conversation in her sleep and had simply hit pause. \u201cBring your spreadsheets and your suspicions. I brought new readers because your father refuses to admit his eyes are aging, and I refuse to pretend I can see ants from across the room.\u201d\n\nSaffiyah was a tangle of legs and promises on the floor, building a fortress out of toast. \u201cI am not coming because numbers make my eyelid twitch,\u201d she announced, propping jam jars as battlements. \u201cBut I will bring snacks later, and wisdom of the domestic kind. Also gossip. The foreign princess has a video of a turtle wearing pearls and she is pretending it is about conservation, and I hate her for being charming when she should be scolded.\u201d\n\n\u201cGossip is only a public service when it keeps wolves from our door,\u201d Hessa said, flipping a page in a folder before she buttered anything. \u201cAnd the princess is not a wolf. She is a mirror held at a inconvenient angle. Either way, Layla will not be scolding anyone until she has proof that their hand is in our cupboard.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps I will scold the cupboard,\u201d Layla said, and she smiled more because she liked the way her aunt\u2019s mouth softened when she made a joke than because the joke was good. Yara poured coffee with that small tilt of the wrist that kept it from splashing, a movement so precise it could have been calligraphy. She had not said a word yet, and Layla did not need her to. Presence was sometimes a better tonic than any advice.\n\nAt nine the Pavilion\u2019s procurement list was a paper jungle, and Layla and Hessa walked through it with a machete made of pencils. Tariq patched into a projector with a cable that had died twice this week and been resurrected by his teeth, and the screen lit up with line items that looked identical until your eyes watered. Filters with alphanumeric names like small insults, adapters that could be purchased for eight riyals or eighty depending on which cousin of which company smiled at you, a subcontractor whose logo was a leaf so green it might be poisonous.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d Hessa said, tapping with the blunt end of her pen where a real person might have used the pen point. \u201cThe mesh. Honeycomb pattern as per the design spec, fine. But the supplier is listed as Al-Layyan Materials, and the invoice address routes to\u2026 hm.\u201d Her glasses slid down her nose, and she slid them back up. \u201cTo an office in the Financial District that is a shelf, not a desk.\u201d\n\nTariq zoomed and the screen complied like a dog that adored him. Behind Al-Layyan Materials nested a name in English that made Layla\u2019s scalp prickle: Hand & Hawk Packaging LLC. It sounded like an inside joke told by two men who had never dirtied their nails on a factory floor. Her finger hovered over the trackpad, and she opened the corporate registry with the neat little permissions that came with her citizenship and her titles and the fact that she had long ago made friends with a clerk who liked sugar dates and long lunches. Hand & Hawk\u2019s directors were appointed through a trust in Avalora named for a valley that did not exist on any public map.\n\n\u201cSo they sell boxes and ghosts,\u201d Tariq said, and the way he said it made the room feel like a lighter had been struck under someone\u2019s sleeve.\n\n\u201cIt might be nothing,\u201d Hessa said, using the tone that meant it was something and that they would treat it like nothing until nothing was exhausted. \u201cGlobal firms are global. Packaging is everywhere. But why are we buying mesh from a paper company whose logo is a hawk holding a hand like a prize?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause somewhere we wanted a sweetheart arrangement and the person who wanted it had a cousin who had a friend who had a golf game with a man named Marcel who gave a discount that is not a discount,\u201d Layla said lightly, and then not lightly at all, \u201cor because someone wanted a handle on our pipeline and found it in a tiny part we would not think to guard.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d Yara asked, finally. She stood with her hands behind her back and her chin at the angle that meant she had a plan already and was waiting to see if Layla would need it.\n\n\u201cAftan Hotel,\u201d Layla said, and Tariq made a small noise like joy trying not to spill. \u201cThe Avaloran delegation has taken the east wing with the view. Their security is good because they hire men who can make their muscles look like arguments. The cameras on the service stairs are blind at twelve minutes past every hour because the circuit is old and lazy. We will not use the service stairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will use the laundry shaft because you are a goat,\u201d Hessa muttered, but there was pride in it, too. \u201cI will handle polite things while you handle impolite ones. Basim will hover like a vulture who is also a poet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI prefer kestrel,\u201d Basim said from the door, because of course he had found them. He flicked his badge with his knuckle as if it were a trick coin. \u201cAnd I bring tidings. The bottle incident has been memed into the shape of a parable. Half of Riyadh applauds your patience. Half of Avalora applauds their princess\u2019s refusal to be told where to place anything, including her opinions. It is theater and you have both made excellent costume choices. Also, someone sent me this.\u201d He passed his camera, and on the screen a photo breathed: Mireille at the waste station, bottle poised, Layla pointing, the blue slot like a wound waiting to be healed. It was beautiful and terrible at once, and a small twinge went through Layla\u2019s stomach at the knowledge that sometimes a picture could be kinder than the truth or crueler.\n\n\u201cPost it tomorrow,\u201d Layla said, and Basim blinked. \u201cLet today be about numbers. Tomorrow we give them a story they can chew while we do work in quiet. If we feed them now, they will be noisy in the wrong place.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if the story bites you?\u201d he asked, because his job was to ask the questions that turned your knees into unsteady furniture.\n\n\u201cThen let it,\u201d she said. \u201cMy knees were never for standing on one place anyway.\u201d\n\nThe Aftan Hotel had the best elevators in the city because its architect understood that a good elevator ride was a poem and a bad elevator ride was a sermon. The glass spine gave you the whole city while you rose, and if you had a fear of heights you were wooed out of it by the smoothness of the ascent and the way the light warmed your shoulders through the pane. Yara shadowed Layla in a slate suit that made her look like a favorite difficulty on a chessboard, and they moved like women who had come to look at a view and possibly complain about a carpet. The concierge recognized Layla in the way of people trained to recognize the weight of certain steps and very kindly asked if she needed anything at all.\n\n\u201cA place to sit for ten minutes and a glass of water,\u201d Layla said, and he smiled like being useful had been his only wish and it had finally been granted. The water arrived with slices of lemon that looked relieved to be cold. The ten minutes were for the security feed to show them its habits, and Yara watched the corner screen while Layla pretended to admire a flawed painting of a desert that had never known grit.\n\n\u201cThis is your goat path,\u201d Yara murmured, as two valet boys wheeled a rack of crisp white sheets into the freight corridor and propped the door with their own good intentions. Layla nodded once, slow. She carried no bag; her abaya hid tools in a way the designer would have felt pleased about if he had ever known, which he would not. The hairpin went into her sleeve and made her feel fifteen again in the quiet part of her chest where she filed the ways she had learned herself.\n\nOn the twelfth floor the corridor smelled like restrained money: lilies cut before they scented; carpet deep enough to trap a paperclip forever. The Avaloran placard with its tasteful crest sat beside a door at the far end as if it had been born there. Two men with necks like thumbs stood with their hands crossed over their belts and their gazes crossed over the air. Layla did not consider them. She did not have to walk past them because the hotel\u2019s spine had other ways to carry a stubborn idea where it wanted to go.\n\nThe laundry shaft mouth was square and inviting if you were a person who had flirted with danger enough to make old friends with it. To anyone else it was a blue door that read STAFF ONLY, which was a sign, not a law. Yara listened through the door like a thief in a play, and when she raised two fingers it meant quiet as a prayer mat and twice as firm. They slipped through and slid the lock with a magnet that had been marketed as a toy and had never met Layla before. The shaft rose around them like a throat. The metal grid made a map for your feet if your feet were small and rude. Yara went first because she always made herself the blade that would catch if something fell. Layla followed because she always chose to be the weight afterward that did not crash.\n\nThey reached the east wing outlet by counting bolts. The grate was old and might as well have handed Layla a screwdriver and a mint for how easily it permitted itself to be persuaded. Behind it, a storage room breathed out the faint eucalyptus scent of housekeeping supplies and something else that was colder, like a laptop left open on a bed. Yara slid into the room and took the cold with her hand; Layla slid after and took the eucalyptus with her lungs. They waited until the building sighed again because buildings always sigh between human movements. Only then did they move.\n\nOn the shelf behind a stack of towels folded into humble, obedient squares, a case sat that had no business looking so ordinary. It was black, zipper-mouthed, sturdy without being loud. Layla opened it with the hairpin because the lock wanted a small intimate conversation. Inside lay a device that pretended to be a router and a device that pretended to be an external battery and a device that had stopped pretending and wanted very much to be a mouth. The hawk-and-hand icon sat on the sticker like a wry promise. She ran a finger along the seam where plastic met arrogance and found the place where the arrogance had not sat quite flush.\n\nYara handed her a cord. The laptop that went with it was the kind men who did jobs in shadows buy when they want to feel powerful inside an airport. It hummed awake. It asked for nothing. It did not know it had been seen by someone who saw it from angles to which it was unaccustomed. Layla did not log in because she did not need to. She did not steal; she borrowed truth and left it where the owners could find it themselves later and pretend they had known it all along. She plugged in a mouth that listened to other mouths and began to copy. She thought briefly of fish scales under the sun, the way they flashed all at once and then hid. Data flowed into a wafer balanced in her palm like a sweet.\n\nFootfalls outside were a different weight than the ones in the laundry corridor. A woman in heels. Another woman not in heels, walking like she had always had places to be and never needed to rush to get to them. Layla looked at Yara, who had already killed the laptop\u2019s smile and replaced it with a blank face that showed nothing but the hotel\u2019s reflected ceiling. The conversation outside was French with the cheap vowels of the very rich who had learned it at school from other rich people who wanted to sound like glass. The name Mireille slipped out once, followed by a laugh like a ladle tapping a pot. Layla closed her eyes and counted to five because five was the number you needed to turn an impulse into a plan.\n\nThe voices faded. A door clicked. The cleaning trolley next door complained in a long wheeze about its broken wheel. Yara breathed in and out, frighteningly quiet, then touched Layla\u2019s sleeve twice to say Go. The data finished its slide into Layla\u2019s naghl, the little chip she wore in a ring that people complimented as tasteful without ever suspecting it was hungry. She sealed everything as they had found it, left no hair in any corner, wiped the place where sweat might have betrayed them, and slipped back into the throat of the building like a word swallowed at a dinner table.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until they were in the elevator again that Layla let herself grin. Even then it was a secret, the kind of smile that belongs to a private victory and a very good piece of baklava you didn\u2019t have to share. Yara looked at her without looking because she had watched Layla read a city and read a man and read a lock, and every one of those readings had given her that exact mouth. \u201cYou will not post about this,\u201d Yara said, flat, which was how she said I will kill any public mention before it stands up.\n\n\u201cI will sing about it to the laundry shaft,\u201d Layla said. \u201cIt appreciated our efforts.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou made a new friend,\u201d Yara said dryly. \u201cIt was square and uncomplaining.\u201d\n\nThey did not go straight back to the Pavilion because going straight back anywhere after doing something illicit is a smell, and they had both learned to be wind instead. They stopped at the salvage yard at the edge of the city where old refrigerators fell in love with old bicycles at sunset and never told anyone. The man who ran the yard had a name everyone had forgotten because they had all called him Uncle for twenty years. He waved at Layla with hands that remembered every screw they had ever turned. \u201cMy Amira,\u201d he said without irony. \u201cYou have come to collect something you did not know you needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came to be reminded of how much isn\u2019t trash,\u201d she said, and he snorted, pleased, because he did not like being called a trash man. He liked being called a midwife to second chances. They walked the aisles where history rusted neatly. She let her fingers skim over a radio that had once lived in a tent in the north and a fan that had once comforted a woman through three summers and the end of a marriage. \u201cDid you used to keep a drawer,\u201d she asked, \u201cfor screws that didn\u2019t belong anywhere yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am the drawer,\u201d he said. \u201cMy life is the drawer. The city empties its pockets into my lap and asks me to find the use. You have a face like you want to empty a pocket into my lap and ask me to not ask questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have scrap mesh in a honeycomb pattern?\u201d she said, and his eyebrows did something acrobatic that made Yara cough to hide a laugh. He did. It had come last week in a crate stamped with three different stamps and none of them sure about their own authority. The pattern was slightly wrong compared to the Pavilion\u2019s\u2014just enough to cut someone who thought their hands were safe.\n\n\u201cHow much?\u201d she asked, and he named a number that did not insult her and did not feel like charity. She paid and he folded the mesh into a parcel like it was a gift for a wedding. When he pressed it into her hands, he touched her knuckles with a rough tenderness and said in a voice that carried more memory than air, \u201cYour grandmother used to come here. She would buy old keys and sit in the shade and polish them while she told me which doors they used to open, even if she had never seen the doors.\u201d\n\nLayla tucked the mesh under her arm as if it were a child. She found herself wanting, with sudden ferocity, to see her grandmother\u2019s handwriting again, the way the letters rose and kneaded each other like bread. Some days the line between the women in her family felt like something you could walk with your eyes closed. Other days it was as thin as hair and just as resilient. On either kind of day she was grateful.\n\nBack at the Pavilion, the sun had made the solar wings smug in their efficiency. The screens had recovered their composure and the waste station lights shone with a confidence that made Layla suspicious of their motives. She fed the copied data into Tariq\u2019s careful machines and watched the packets blossom like bacteria on a petri dish. The hawk and the hand flew through the code with a sly small motion, and beneath it a layer of something domestic wriggled.\n\n\u201cThis is ours,\u201d Tariq said, squinting. \u201cNot the icon. The signature under it. Someone fed an Avaloran beast our bread. Look at the time stamps on these handshake requests. Look at the IP range. It looped through a local exchange that we own the dirt under.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho owns the cable that touches the dirt that touches that exchange?\u201d Hessa asked, leaning in so close to the screen her glasses fogged from its warmth. She wiped them on her shawl. \u201cWho, and which cousin in whose office signed the contract that let them write their name in pencil where it should have been carved in stone?\u201d\n\nLayla made the calls she could make without anyone knowing she had made them. The answers came dressed in the coats of the very polite; she took them anyway and left the coats on the backs of chairs. A domestic firm with an international nickname had been brought in to secure the Pavilion\u2019s data because it made investors feel safe to hear that the men guarding their money wore suits and said zero knowledge with confidence. The firm subcontracted the grunt work to a company with a logo that looked good on glass. The subcontractors had bought tools online like clever children handing out cheating devices before an exam. Somewhere in that pipeline, someone with a sense of humor had told a story with a hawk and a hand on it.\n\n\u201cSo she may have nothing to do with it,\u201d Basim said, voicing the sentence that tasted of both relief and disappointment. \u201cThe foreign princess may be a red herring with very good taste in dresses.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr she has everything to do with it and she is so very good at using the hands of other people that we will never see fingerprints,\u201d Hessa said. \u201cYou don\u2019t catch a fish by deciding it must be a goat. You mind what you are holding.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we are holding is a chance to decide what kind of city we are,\u201d Layla said, and the room went still like a library at noon. \u201cDo we snarl and push, do we adopt the manners of those who bet on our faltering, do we let ourselves be made theatrical? Or do we stay boring in public and dangerous in private? I prefer the second. It is more effective and more satisfying to my petty heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour heart is not petty,\u201d Yara said, and the tone in her voice made Layla\u2019s throat go tight for a moment, as if something had blossomed there too quickly. \u201cYour heart knows how to weigh stones.\u201d\n\nThe message from Mireille came late afternoon, a crisp invitation delivered by email and paper both because her people understood that some audiences liked one or the other and some liked to refuse both. It asked Layla to a private salon at the Aftan that evening, no cameras, no agenda, only mutual admiration of sunlight turned into water. It was signed with a flourish that looked like a spilled thread of pearl.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t go,\u201d Layla said, not looking at anyone as she read it again. \u201cOr I will go and bring a recorder and a small bomb, and since both options are rude, we will do neither. I will invite her to us. To the stables outside Wadi Hanifa where the falconers train on Thursdays. If she was going to dress her icon in a bird she can at least be asked to hold one.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are going to make her carry a living thing she can\u2019t drop in the wrong bin,\u201d Saffiyah crowed from the doorway, having drifted in with the timing of a theatre sprite. \u201cThis is an act of genius, and I will come to watch and cry with deep emotion like the onion made me.\u201d She flopped onto a chair and kicked it with a heel until it stopped wobbling. \u201cBy the way, I signed us up for a community panel with the girls from the university tomorrow. They want to shout for you and make friendship bracelets and discuss policies like they are embroidery patterns. It will be chaos. You will love it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will love it,\u201d Layla said, looking at her sister with the kind of gratitude that did not always find words. \u201cAlso, I bought us mesh.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did what?\u201d\n\nLayla took them down to the maintenance belly and showed them the parcel like she had adopted a stray cat. Tariq grinned as if she had brought him a new punctuation mark. \u201cWe will swap one panel in a place no one thinks to look,\u201d he said before she spoke it. \u201cWe will tag the panel like it is a fish. We will watch who tries to bite; we will learn where the bite comes from; we will see which line goes taut.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not entirely legal,\u201d Hessa observed, and no one dignified that with more than a glance because the legality of anything depended on whether the law had been designed to punish exactly the kinds of men who did not imagine anyone would ever do what they did to them.\n\nDusk came down dressed like a pomegranate peel, a little red, a little rough, promising sweetness if you wanted to work for it. The falconers met Layla at the edge of the wadi where the palm shadows tilted and then straightened themselves like men adjusting their cuffs. The birds looked like carved questions on their perches, eyes hooded, feathers polished by air. The head falconer, a man with a manner like a dry well that didn\u2019t show you its depth, bowed to Layla and then let his gaze rest on Mireille with the experienced indifference of someone who had seen many people try to look important in front of something that did not care.\n\nMireille came in white again because a brand is a small god and must be fed. She looked out of place and was not. People who had been rich for a long time knew how to make place shift to accommodate them rather than the other way round. She did not smile too soon. When the hood came off the first falcon and the bird\u2019s eye presented its clean thought to the evening, Mireille did an odd thing. She forgot to be clever. Her face emptied of tactic and filled with wonder because no one renders you more honest than a creature that has no patience for your shape of lying. She held out a hand without thinking, and even Layla wanted to take back her suspicion for one second and let it fall into the sand like a coin that had done its job.\n\nThe bird hopped to her glove with the insolent delicacy of a creature who knows you will not drop it. Mireille\u2019s shoulders softened. She looked down in a way that made the lines around her mouth relax into a different woman. \u201cHe is very light,\u201d she said in accented Arabic, and Layla almost smiled because the grammar was wrong but the sentiment was right. \u201cHe is very light, and I am heavier than I look.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of us are,\u201d Layla said. \u201cHe is light because he is all function. No hoarding. Only muscle that is used and bone that is needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is why you like him,\u201d Mireille said, glancing up as if they were sharing a joke that had merits in both languages. \u201cYou believe in function.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe in grace,\u201d Layla said, and the falconer made a sound that might have been approval, which in his language was a poem.\n\nThey let Mireille fly the bird and bring him back, and Layla watched the way she watched. There were people who watched so they could own the thing they were watching with a story later. There were people who watched because watching is a kind of prayer. Mireille, to Layla\u2019s surprise, watched like a woman who occasionally forgot to perform and remembered what it felt like to be a person. The hood went back on. The bird\u2019s world went dark in the kind way, not the cruel kind. Mireille\u2019s smile was small and private when she handed him back.\n\n\u201cYou invited me to educate me,\u201d she said later, standing with her heel sinking into the sand like a small truth. \u201cWhich is charming in an arrogant way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI invited you because if you are going to throw symbols around, you should meet at least one living thing they stand in for,\u201d Layla said. \u201cAnd because I liked your message. It was written like a woman who gets what she wants by pretending what she wants is what you want.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said no,\u201d Mireille observed, something like good humor shading the syllables.\n\n\u201cI said later,\u201d Layla corrected. \u201cLater is a word with many rooms.\u201d She waited. Mireille did not fill the quiet with an offer. That was telling. People who controlled rooms did not often tolerate quiet.\n\n\u201cYou think I am picking at you because it pleases me to be contrary,\u201d Mireille said finally, more to the sky than to Layla. \u201cAnd sometimes I am. It is a sport. But also\u2014pay attention\u2014I am showing you what the world will do when it is bored of your virtue and wants something messy to bite. Your tidy story will be challenged. Your graphs will tremble. Your supporters will become bored and will want meat. You will have to decide how to feed them without choking yourself.\u201d She looked at Layla then, and this time her expression had no lace on it. \u201cI do not recycle because I am lazy, yes. But also because I live in a place that has decided gently not to bother me. You live in a place that is deciding to bother itself. You are making your country an inconvenience. I admire it. And I will make it harder for you because that is what everything does. If you survive me you will survive the day after I am gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour foreword to my memoir is drafted, thank you,\u201d Layla said, dry as the ground they stood on. \u201cNow stop throwing bottles where I can see you. You can keep not sorting your trash in your private life as a hobby, but not in my house. My mother raised me to be a polite host, and my aunt will murder you with a butter knife if you embarrass her catering staff again.\u201d\n\nMireille laughed then like a burst of grapefruit and slid her sunglasses on though the sun was almost gone. \u201cI look forward to our little wars,\u201d she said, and the falconer who had never looked forward to any war in his life fed his bird with his back turned because he disliked watching people make metaphors near animals too clean to deserve them.\n\nNight carried them back into the city with the kind of velvet that makes you forget knives exist. The data Tariq had copied unfolded into a map they could use. They tracked handshake requests to a server room in a building three blocks from the Pavilion, a building with a logo that told you nothing except that someone had money. Basement, back corner, locked twice for show and once properly. The guard on the night shift had a radio that did not work and a book he pretended not to be reading. Layla imagined the long hallway where the cords hung like sleeping snakes and felt that old electric hunger in her hands. It would be so easy to go now, to write a story in the cables and leave with half the answer she needed. It would be easy, and that made it exactly the wrong moment.\n\n\u201cWe will wait,\u201d she told Yara, who had already opened the glove box where an illegal key card slept like a chocolate no one was supposed to eat. \u201cWe will make them comfortable. Tariq will feed them patterns in their sleep. We will ask the building for its gossip. We will pretend to be busy with ribbon cuttings and university panels. Then we will step into their pantry and steal back our spices.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will step,\u201d Yara said. \u201cI will throw you if you hesitate.\u201d\n\n\u201cNoted,\u201d Layla said, and smiled into the traffic, which glowed with the promise that people everywhere were doing small stupid brave things and trying to get home.\n\nThe university panel sprawled over the next afternoon like a picnic with an agenda. Girls with notebooks and glitter eyeliner asked questions with both hands; professors attempted to herd discussion into squares and failed in ways that delighted Layla; an earnest young man in a vest gave a speech about individual choice that made Hessa\u2019s eyebrow raise incrementally until it threatened to detach. Layla told them the truth about systems without removing the shine from their individual agency, which was a magic trick that left her throat sore. She did, inevitably, demonstrate the waste station herself because the optics were divine and because repetition is the mother of competence. When a girl with a shaky voice confessed that her father refused to recycle because the neighbors didn\u2019t and it made him feel foolish to be alone, Layla said they would send the father a letter of gratitude signed by a minister and a schoolchild and a goalkeeper. The room laughed, and the girl cried in a way that was not dramatic but did feel like a small dam had been asked to be a river for a minute.\n\nAfterwards, in the hallway, Basim handed her a print of the waste station photograph. He had done something with the light that made it kinder. \u201cIs this the one you want?\u201d he asked, and his voice was not the voice he used for work. \u201cOr do you want the one where your jaw looks like you are about to bite her?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis one,\u201d she said. \u201cThe city is a better place when I swallow and chew later.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have become politician enough to give me mottos,\u201d he teased, but there was affection in it like a soft scarf thrown over your shoulders whether you wanted it or not. \u201cSend me a note when you plan something stupid so I can make pictures that look like you meant it.\u201d\n\nThe message from the unknown number came again that night, this time with a link that wanted to be clicked in the way a snake wants to be stroked. It promised a list of \u201cfriendly vendors\u201d who might relieve the Pavilion of the burden of having to do everything itself. It signed itself M again and added a heart as if that made the letter less arrogant. Layla stared at it long enough that the phone turned its face off of its own accord and sulked. She took the hairpin out of the drawer and turned it in her fingers until the metal warmed. Then she put it back and called a woman in a tiny office in a gray building on the edge of the city, a woman who filed import documents like she was composing a symphony and who had once saved Layla from a fine by knowing a thing about beet sugar that no one else remembered at the right moment.\n\n\u201cI need to know who stamped a crate marked disposable telecommunications equipment with a hawk,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I need to know if the stamp belongs to anyone whose name I can say out loud without making enemies whose houses I have to visit at Eid.\u201d\n\nThe woman hummed like a refrigerator and said she would call back tomorrow if God allowed. Layla thanked her and hung up and wished there was a hobby that did not require patience. She walked to the roof because roofs were honest. Yara followed with two cups of tea that steamed like weather. The city glowed and murmured and forgave nothing. It was rude and beautiful and very awake. It was the place that had made Layla into something that could climb and apologize in the same breath.\n\n\u201cYou were kinder to her today than you needed to be,\u201d Yara said after they had both finished half their cups and the silence had settled into something comfortable. \u201cAt the falcons.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am always kinder than I need to be until there is teeth,\u201d Layla said. \u201cEveryone else has teeth. They enjoy biting. I prefer to press. When you press the right places on the right days, you make something that looks like a miracle and is just leverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want me to stand in a different place in the room when she is near you?\u201d Yara asked. \u201cBecause I stood two steps away today and I can stand one if you want to feel my breath on your neck and remember to be careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Layla said softly, because two steps had felt like trust and she did not want to trade that for the kind of security that made you sad later without knowing why. \u201cTwo steps is right. It lets me see you and not need you, which is a luxury I like.\u201d\n\nThey sat until the tea was cold and the rumor of a cat fight rose and fell in the alley like a tiny war lost and won. Somewhere, the city\u2019s newest desalination unit purred and ticked and gave a glass of water to a woman who had forgotten to buy any and now would not have to. Somewhere else, a man who had never thought about waste did a small right thing because a sign had been drawn charmingly enough that he believed it had been written just for him. Layla held these like coins in the back of her mouth and let them make her speech richer with their wanting.\n\nIn the morning, the woman from the gray building called. Her voice was triumphant and exhausted, the way joy often is when it has been earned. \u201cIt is a private security stamp, not a customs stamp,\u201d she said. \u201cIt belongs to a firm that was given three contracts last quarter to \u2018harden vulnerable flows\u2019 at public sites. Someone repurposed the marking procedure for their own inventory to mark yours without asking. The signature under the signature is domestic. You will not say the name because you like to keep your leads longer than two days.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not say the name,\u201d Layla agreed, and wrote it down anyway because writing names down was a ritual that made them less slippery. The name was familiar. It belonged to a man who smiled beautifully and never wore the same watch twice and who had told Layla at a luncheon that he admired her because she had made the word sustainability sound sexy. She had wanted then to put his tongue in a drawer and ask him to write the word ten times until he cried.\n\nShe made a list. It counted like a prayer. Call the minister and ask him why menace is easier to purchase than maintenance. Visit the basement with the friendly guard when the building had hiccuped itself to sleep. Replace the honeycomb mesh and set the hook; see what bit. Write a letter with Saffiyah to the father who did not want to be the only recycler on his street. Feed the cameras something wholesome while they swiveled in search of blood. Ask Mireille to do one hard thing in public and hold her to it with a velvet rope.\n\nShe put the list in her pocket. It sat above the seam she had sewn herself, a small secret space that made her feel thirteen and invincible. Then she went to work, not the kind of work people photograph but the kind that turns a country into itself by repetition and the faint stubborn joy of small corrections. Riyadh rose and threw its light on her hands and all the hands around her. The desert listened. The city did not hold its breath; it exhaled, and the air moved where she needed it to go. She let herself think, for a flicker, of a woman abroad waking to find a courier at her door with a package wrapped in brown paper and two words on a card: Sort this. Then she put that away and turned to the nearest knot, which was not a villain but a habit dressed in a logo, and she began to untie it.",

                              "content": "By late morning the Pavilion had settled into the rhythm of a space that knew exactly how much it could give without taking damage. Pipes ticked behind walls like discreet metronomes keeping promises; the waste stations blinked blue-green-blue with the patience of teachers who had been warned the class would arrive late and wired. Layla walked its spine with Hessa three paces behind, Tariq orbiting with a tablet under his chin as if the numbers might drip away if he didn\u2019t hold them close. They were not hunting trouble as much as laying a table where trouble might arrive thinking it had been invited. The parcel of salvaged mesh they had bought from the yard sat on a maintenance cart beneath a nest of innocent mop heads and a coil of hose. Tariq had embroidered a thread of aftermarket brilliance along its edge: a wafer-thin sensor that would wake if anyone not listed on their quiet registry tampered with the panel, and a whisper-tag in the solder that would sing to them in a frequency most security equipment ignored because it sounded like an air conditioner about to learn humility.\n\nThey chose the place by committee, the way families choose where to sit at a wedding when one cousin will talk to another only if there is bread between them. The intake vent above the gray-water reclaim was too obvious; the inspection hatch near the compost digesters was too beloved by engineers who prided themselves on noticing what normal people didn\u2019t. They ended up at a knee-high mesh guard on the shaded side of the south wing where no guest had reason to loiter and every contractor stepped without thinking on Thursdays. Layla knelt on the warm concrete, lifted the existing panel with gloved hands, and slid the new one into place with the tenderness of someone putting a sleepy child into a borrowed bed. Tariq fussed with his tools for the sake of anyone watching on the wrong camera, and Hessa repurposed her shawl as shade so the angle of Layla\u2019s shoulder would be less intimate to the lens.\n\n\u201cWhen they come, they will come like men do when they believe the street has always been theirs,\u201d Hessa said, not quite whispering. \u201cThey will step carelessly. They will assume the grate means safety, the way they assume a uniform means lower rank. They will teach us their habits by practicing them.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay their shoes be rubber and their excuses thin,\u201d Tariq murmured, and his grin took the sting off the prayer. \u201cDone. Our fish swims. We wait for a bite.\u201d\n\nWaiting was never a vacuum in Layla\u2019s house; it was an opportunity disguised as a pause. She and Hessa walked from the south wing straight into a majlis where chairs were arranged like chess pieces in the shade, and men whose handshakes might have been currencies if you could carry them in your pocket sat as if heat never touched them. The watch-smiling man was there in a linen suit the color of milk froth, a face like a promise, a timepiece heavy enough to count as an heirloom even if he had bought it last week. His name, on paper, belonged to a respectable father and a school with winter; in rooms like this he wore whatever name pleased his audience. Today he let himself be called Nabil because it suited the vowels around him.\n\n\u201cYou do us honor, Amira,\u201d he said, standing the exact second before she reached him like a man who knew choreography and enjoyed it. \u201cWe were all saying we had not yet seen the new miracle of your Pavilion, and then Rahman reminded us we are only men and should be patient until we have earned a tour.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will always be welcome if your shoes are clean,\u201d Layla said, and his laugh was correct. She made it easy for him because easy made men forget to be careful, and she wanted him uncareful. Hessa sank into a chair that creaked at her as if a grandmother had approved of its choice of company and folded her shawl in a way that turned it into a weapon if conversation required.\n\nThey spoke of water as if it were an acquaintance everyone respected and many abused. Nabil shone in these rooms; he had the talent of offering truisms with enough grace that people took them as gifts instead of as empty plates. \u201cSecurity is the second spine,\u201d he intoned at one point, and several heads nodded because spines were something men allowed themselves to respect even as they hired cheaper hands to bend them. Layla let him talk until her tea cooled from hot to hospitable. Then she asked him, very gently, who had recommended the firm that had stamped a hawk where a seal should have been and why the board\u2019s procurement committee had discovered three layers of subcontractor instead of the one they had approved.\n\nIt was a press, not a bite. She watched him for the wince. He could have chosen any number of exits. He could have feigned ignorance and later sent a bag of dates his assistant would swear had come from his aunt. He could have named a civil servant who could not defend himself because he was in Makkah with his mother. He chose the oldest path: he leaned forward, made his voice five degrees warmer, and said he had done what everyone did. \u201cWe all hire relationships,\u201d he said, careful to not insult while acknowledging he had expected to be untouchable. \u201cThis city runs on trust. Your Pavilion is a jewel; we wanted it guarded by people who value jewels. If someone wrote their names under ours, it is because they hoped your success would polish their own. Let me look. I will straighten the shelf.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is generous,\u201d Layla said, and the word meant exactly what it meant when you offer someone a jug to carry and watch whether they slosh. \u201cWe will look together. Bring your paperwork to the Palace at ten. Bring the cousin who chooses your watches. We will feed you both and see which of you eats with your left hand under the table.\u201d\n\nHe laughed again, this time thinner. Hessa smiled with her mouth and not at all with her eyes. They let him leave thinking he had made a friend of a problem, and perhaps he had, in the way you sometimes befriend a scrupulous neighbor because you cannot avoid borrowing sugar from her when the shops are closed.\n\nBasim\u2019s photograph appeared on a hundred screens after lunch, posted not by him but by students with respectable families and noisy enthusiasm. In it, Layla\u2019s finger pointed and her face was soft enough that the instruction looked like an invitation. The bottle gleamed at the apex of choice as if it had been waiting its whole plastic life to be told where to go. Mireille\u2019s mouth was the same shape people\u2019s mouths take when they first see their reflection after a haircut they commissioned and regret. The avalanche of comments was the kind that makes publicists either earn their salary or quit. Half of the internet practiced manners on strangers; the other half practiced cruelty under the flag of accountability. Saffiyah stood on a sofa and read them aloud until Hessa swatted her with a cushion and told her to feed her mouth with almonds instead of nonsense.\n\n\u201cShall we post a challenge?\u201d Saffiyah asked, mouth full, eyes sinister with glee. \u201cThe Princess Sorting Cup. Children versus CEOs. Winner gets to choose a wildflower garden and a library book order; loser gets to carry compost for a day like it is their handbag.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Layla said, and the word was long, stretching from joke to weapon. \u201cWe will make it a game and a rite. Children will win. The adults will look handsome while losing. People will like them for it. This will build us a little bridge while we are busy under the river, moving stones.\u201d\n\nThe under-the-river work waited until the city had bruised into evening and the Pavilion\u2019s day-shift laughter had been swept into buckets and poured into the mop sinks to dry. The building three blocks away breathed blue light through its ground floor as if it had swallowed an aquarium. Layla wore gray that did not ask to be noticed; Yara wore a jacket that said she belonged anywhere she had chosen. They carried a foil pan of sambusas balanced on a roll of printer paper and an accident in their back pockets. The guard at the desk looked up with a man\u2019s relief at being spared his own boredom and eyed the food like it had never in his life meant anything but love.\n\n\u201cYou look like my cousin,\u201d Layla said, smiling as if this were the best kind of coincidence. \u201cAnd you look hungry. We have a delivery for the basement because someone upstairs thinks people downstairs do not need to eat. Will you prove them wrong and help me do this properly?\u201d\n\nHe puffed a little under the kindness because kindness in city buildings often arrives wearing a clipboard and no patience. He led them, as gently as a man can lead two women who move like trouble that has been domesticated, to a door with two locks and a tired camera. He buzzed it like he was sneaking a cat into a hotel. Inside, the hum settled into their bones. Server rooms are the closest most people get to hearing a whale sing; if you love machines the sound can make your back straighten as if someone had called your name.\n\nThey did not hurry because haste looks like guilt when replayed on slow video. Yara chatted about air filters as if they were gossiping a scandal; Layla set the sambusas on the edge of a rack and apologized to the saints of cleanliness for leaving crumbs in a room where dust is the only religion. The hawk-and-hand sticker they had expected waited on a case bolted to the wall with the neat arrogance of people who think a lock is a suggestion. Tariq\u2019s voice was mild in their ears through a bud that anyone would mistake for a pearl. He narrated the way a fisherman narrates the sea. \u201cTwo devices talking where only one should. One is the building\u2019s; one is the hawk\u2019s. Give me the hawk\u2019s tongue if you can. Scratch it if you cannot.\u201d\n\nLayla looked for a tongue and found a throat. The cable that shouldn\u2019t be there snaked out of the case with the electricity of people caught in the wrong kiss. She slid her tool under the lip of the casing, felt the screw\u2019s thread like a familiar scar, and coaxed it. The room had that particular cold that makes fingers lie about how nimble they are. She scolded hers silently and they obeyed. Yara\u2019s body blocked the camera\u2019s view with the indifference of an employee leaning to read a label. The lid came away. Inside, the device pretended to be something it was not in the way of most trouble. Layla touched it once, light as the throat of a sleeping child, and then pulled the line that turned its voice into a loop. It would still speak, and their friends would still hear it, but it would be telling the same story it had told an hour ago, not the one it was living now.\n\n\u201cSlow mirror installed,\u201d she said, and her mouth tasted of pleased metal. \u201cIf they are watching, they will be watching yesterday. If they are lazy, they will never notice the day has gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cLazy is a habit, too,\u201d Tariq said, equal parts delight and caution. \u201cCome home.\u201d\n\nThey left samosas and took away nothing anyone would miss on a checklist. The guard accepted two pastries like a man receiving absolution and promised to tell his supervisor that the ladies had been neat and thoughtful. Layla wanted to kiss his forehead for being the kind of man who filed kindness as a professional courtesy. She settled for a blessing that made him blink, which was almost as good.\n\nBack at the Pavilion, the fish sang. Tariq put the feed from the whisper-tag on a screen that only the five of them could see and watched as the outline of a hand reached toward their grate. No face. No brand on a boot. The print was in keystrokes and route pings, not a wrist. A call had been placed to a junior mechanic from what looked like the Facilities desk asking for a sweep of the south wing. The voice\u2014recorded and pitched lower by software afraid of its own timbre\u2014belonged to no one and everyone. The boy who had come at the call was younger than Layla had imagined and sweating like virtue in a sauna. He had done exactly what a good employee should: he had checked the panel, taken a picture for his log, tried to lift the mesh without removing the screws because someone always tries to cheat the step that requires a tool, and then backed away because the grate had bitten him with Tariq\u2019s hidden thread. He had sucked his finger like a child surprised by piano wire and then, because he was conscientious, reported the anomaly to a number that did not belong to the Pavilion.\n\n\u201cInvite him to tea,\u201d Hessa said, before anyone said call security. \u201cBring him to the garden and give him water and look at his hand. He will understand kindness better than a pamphlet about cybersecurity. He will tell you who told him to answer numbers that do not belong to his supervisor.\u201d\n\nThey brought him, the young mechanic with the bitten finger. He had the face of a boy who had learned to carry refrigerators with his uncles and never complained because he loved the way they praised him for being strong. He looked at Layla as if she were a road he had not been told how to cross. She asked after his mother\u2019s health; he answered that she had plantar fasciitis in a tone that meant he did not know why he had told her that and was glad he had. She asked who told him to call the number on his phone and he answered like a man afraid of both silence and sound. The number had appeared in a text from \u201cFacilities Support\u201d two weeks ago with the stamp of someone who knew how to mimic an internal memo. It offered faster solutions, fewer signatures, a way to serve the Pavilion better without bothering the people who were too important to be interrupted. He had believed it because believing it felt like being useful. Layla asked to see his phone; he handed it to her like it was a lucky coin that had stopped working. She photographed the text and the number and the second number that appeared when she tapped on a detail most people never tapped. She handed his phone back and told him that being useful sometimes meant being rude to a lie.\n\nHe left with cookies and a bandage. Tariq had three new threads to pull that tasted like victory because they were, in fact, favors disguised as dumb mistakes. One number traced back to a switchboard in a business park that rented addresses to ghosts. Another pointed, briefly and then with shyness, to a suite on the fifteenth floor of a building where Mireille\u2019s delegation currently slept and dressed and pretended they were not closely watched. This might have been a decoy. It might have been theater. The third number belonged to a woman named Aaliyah who had once worked as a receptionist in a small firm that had been purchased by a larger one and now maintained the fiction of local presence for clients who liked to believe they were hiring neighbors. Aaliyah had a public Instagram full of plants receiving too much water and motivational quotes arranged on tiles like prayers you were allowed to forget at will. Layla sent her a message that said there had been an error in the routing of a maintenance call and that Aaliyah was a dear to help straighten it. Sugar first. Rope later.\n\nThat night, while the city put on its jewelry and pretended the heat was flirting rather than oppressive, Mireille posted a video of herself wearing a falconer\u2019s glove and letting a bird step onto it with clean confidence. The caption was clever and said nothing. Someone else added a line that made it mean something unkind. She turned off comments after fifteen minutes because she had learned to give the world only as many doorways as she could guard. Layla did not answer. Saffiyah did. She reposted a picture of a little girl from yesterday\u2019s panel cupping a geranium seedling with a fierceness that would have made entire armies reconsider their plans and wrote, \u201cOur city is training hands.\u201d The internet, being both cruel and tender in alternating lungfuls, applauded.\n\nSleep was a ricochet that refused to land. When it finally did, it did so at the exact wrong hour. Layla had thirty minutes of heavy, graceless blackout and then woke with the name Nabil on her tongue like a seed she had almost swallowed. She dressed in the quiet way of a person who has never forgotten sleeping beside other people who did not have the luxury to be interrupted by her insomnia. She had promised to be polite in the morning and sharp in the afternoon. The knife waited under the shawl.\n\nThe meeting at ten could have been any meeting in any building designed for moldings to impress men who believed plaster was a personality trait. The table shone like there had never been fingerprints on it. Water bottles stood in tidy formation, their labels aligned as if they were soldiers waiting for a general to sneeze. Nabil arrived with a portfolio like a priest bringing bread. The cousin with the watches did not come; he sent instead a man with the white hands of someone who moves other people\u2019s money and believes it is clean because he has never had to scrub it off. Hessa complimented the pastries; Layla did not sit until everyone had discovered they did not quite know where to place their elbows.\n\nThe paperwork said what paperwork always says when it is asked to be honest: too much and not enough. Layla looked at the same clause three times and each time it revealed a new way to twist itself into manners. She did not raise her voice. She did not accuse. She asked practical questions in a tone that made it impossible to turn her into a bully in a story told later over coffee. Why did the subcontractor invoice carry a markup twice standard for the region? Why had the risk assessment been copied from a white paper about banking infrastructure and not one about water? Why did the emergency contact numbers list a firm in Avalora as if the sea were going to kindly wait while you settled your institutional crush?\n\nNabil took it well until he did not. The moment the sweat appeared on his temple he knew it and resented it. \u201cYou are making me look a thief,\u201d he said softly, and Layla almost sighed because men often thought shape was substance. \u201cI have done nothing others have not done. I have simply done it in a room where you can see me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am making you look responsible,\u201d she said, and her mouth was generous enough that the sentence did not sound like a blow. \u201cWhich is, perhaps, worse in some rooms. But this is not that room. You will help us unwind this braid. You know who tied it. You know who took their percentage and whether they earned it. You know who sent out numbers to boys in good shoes telling them to respond quickly to be useful. You will find them. And before you do, you will write a letter on your company\u2019s letterhead admitting that the hawk was stamped on our house without our permission and asking for our forgiveness. You will name no names. You will not make us appear foolish. You will give us the grace of being the first to say what everyone already knows.\u201d\n\nHessa watched him with grandmother eyes that had never learned to be sentimental. The man with the white hands pretended to be a plant and succeeded for three seconds. Paper moved. The city breathed in a little and did not breathe out yet because it liked to see a man be pressed until he knew he had bones.\n\nAfter, when the room was empty except for crumbs who had never learned to look dignified, Hessa exhaled the breath the building had been holding. \u201cYour father thinks negotiation is a dance,\u201d she said. \u201cYou treat it like a calligraphy exercise that you intend to execute in the middle of a herd of goats. It is an art. I approve.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like goats,\u201d Layla said, rubbing her eyes with the heel of her hand. \u201cThey have no patience for pretension. They eat your schemes.\u201d\n\nAfternoon returned them to the Pavilion just in time for the first proof that the hawk\u2019s tongue had noticed its mirror. A lag in the data feed pricked Tariq\u2019s attention like a nettle. It was the kind of blip you could blame on heat if you wanted to remain lazy. Tariq did not like lazy except when he practiced it as recreational rebellion. He followed the blip from a diverted packet to a looped command to a handshake that died and resurrected with the desperation of an actor missing his cue. The loop was working; their friend was watching a version of the building that was behaving. That meant that somewhere else someone had decided to switch emphasis, to test an edge they had not bothered before. Three minutes later, the fire suppression system in the east gallery hiccupped. It did not release; it thought about releasing and had a half-formed thought about rain. The correct valve yawned and then remembered its manners. No one got wet. A donor got her hair startled. The photograph in the local paper showed her eyes doing the thing eyes do when confronted with the possibility that water might be unacceptable.\n\n\u201cIt was a tap on the window,\u201d Tariq said, high with the thrill he did not allow to show on his face because he respected systems and their moods. \u201cA flirtation. They like the idea of drama. They are seeing if we flinch.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not flinch in public,\u201d Layla said, and the instruction was to herself as much as to the staff. \u201cFlinch here where it is safe.\u201d She went to the valve room and put her hand on the pipe that had almost been unkind. It vibrated with the leftover energy of a decision not taken. She stayed there long enough that Yara cleared her throat twice, and then left with the conviction that a system can be loved into better behavior if its shepherd is stubborn enough.\n\nEvening fell on the city like a lid, not a blanket. The temperature did not drop so much as decide to lean away from cruelty and into endurance. Aaliyah with the overwatered plants sent a message that she had been told by her manager to forward all \u201cspecial maintenance\u201d requests to a list of numbers she was not to question. She included the list. It was a web, not a ladder. It named nobody. It named everyone. It had a rhythm she recognized: men who had built their status on being the person you called when you did not want to call the person you should. It would take time; it would not be an arrest. It would be a dozen small corrections and a few ruined lunches. She was good at lunch.\n\nWhen she had finished the last call and written the last note and set the last small trap that would take three days to spring, Layla let herself be carried by habit up the final flight of stairs to the roof. The night pressed its cool mouth to her forehead the way a mother does when all the scolding has been done and the house is quiet again. The city sang its soft vicious lullaby. She lay down the way she had done since sixteen when she first learned that flat roofs can cure you of believing you are the only person awake. Yara came with blankets and a battery-powered fan that hummed like a cricket who had gotten a promotion. They lay side by side, the way women who trust each other do when the world allows them a horizontal hour.\n\n\u201cYou pressed well,\u201d Yara said into the slice of sky between them. \u201cHe will fold and call it outreach. Another will feel the heat and call it vision. Two more will resent you and find ways to send you love they think is poison. We will drink it and call it lemonade.\u201d\n\n\u201cLemonade would be too sweet,\u201d Layla said. \u201cI want the kind of sour that makes your teeth ache and then goes away and leaves you better for having been awake in your mouth.\u201d She considered Mireille\u2019s face with the bird and Nabil\u2019s watch and the boy\u2019s bitten finger and felt a flicker of absurd gratitude that she was alive in a place that asked her for more than speeches. \u201cIf she is the hawk,\u201d she added after a moment, \u201cshe is not the hand. The hand is domestic and thinks itself benevolent. The hand will be harder to teach because it thinks it is already learned.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we will set out a basin and make it wash itself,\u201d Yara said. \u201cAnd we will watch to see whether it knows to scrub the back and the part between thumb and first finger where men pretend no dirt sticks. We will be here tomorrow and the day after. That is our trick.\u201d\n\nThey slept in shifts that their bodies knew even when their phones did not ring. At three, a cat padded across Layla\u2019s stomach and reminded her of gravity. At four, the muezzin\u2019s voice lifted from the minaret like a cloth laid lightly over a table. At five, a message from an unknown number arrived with the insolent cheer of a person who believes night belongs to them. It was not signed M; it was signed with a hawk alone and a link that promised \u201cproof of carelessness at the Pavilion\u201d. Layla did not click it. She wrote the number down in a hand her grandmother would have recognized and turned the phone face down. She rose, washed, and prayed for the ability to not hate small men who do big damage because she needed that hatred for fuel elsewhere.\n\nBy nine the Pavilion had another tour and another reason to smile and another person risking the sin of calling it flawless in print. By noon the schoolchildren beat the CEOs at the Sorting Cup so beautifully that half the adults in the room conspicuously arranged to be on the children\u2019s team for the last round. By two the hawk\u2019s mirror caught an unfamiliar hand at their grate, this time nimble enough to unscrew what could not be lifted. By two-oh-three the hand froze because it felt, not heard, the small current that coursed through the mesh. By two-oh-four the phone in the hand vibrated with a text that read abort in a language that carried vowels like knives. By two-oh-six, the person attached to the hand had gone, but not, for once, so fast they became a blur. Cameras that had learned indifference from long practice remembered how to be curious. Tariq ran the footage through a machine that did not look like a machine and saw what he needed: not a face, never a face, but a shirt that did not belong to any contractor signed that day and a shoulder seam that had been repaired by a tailor with a particular habit of using gold thread hidden where only other tailors would notice.\n\n\u201cUncle in the salvage yard has that habit,\u201d Saffiyah said, more a thought than a boast. \u201cBut he would never sew for those men. He hates them because they throw their televisions away when the remote breaks. There is a man on Tahlia who fixes suits for chauffeurs who do not want their bosses to know their dogs chewed their cuffs. He uses gold where he thinks no one will find it because he says a gentleman should always carry a secret shine.\u201d\n\n\u201cFind the gentleman,\u201d Layla said, and it felt almost ridiculous to be tracking a man through a stitch when you had wires singing secrets in your walls. It felt, also, like the only way to catch a habit is to notice where it has tried to dress itself up.\n\nEvening delivered the man with the secret shine to a shop that sold cufflinks that looked like tiny anchors and ties that looked like apologies. He was not a villain; he was a nephew. He was a brother. He had a face that would not trouble his mother while she prayed. He had been given a job by a cousin who told him it was patriotism to help build a resilience network against foreign interference. The irony of a domestic hand dressed in a foreign hawk was not lost on him and would never make him do or not do anything. Layla pressed him in the slow manner of a woman fitting a glove. He gave her enough names to thicken the knot. He did not know he had given her more with the way his eyes moved only at the word Avalora and not at the names of the men who had called him brother while paying him cash.\n\nThe door of everything continued to swing on small hinges. Each time she touched one, Layla felt the old joy, not of power, but of competence. She could do this. She had made herself the kind of person who knew which screw to pocket and which to leave half-turn loose so that when the wrong hand tried it, the whole contraption would squeal. She did not need the desert to forgive her or the city to applaud her; she needed only to move the next stubborn thing into a better place. When Hessa brought her tea at midnight, silent and bearing the kind of sugar only a woman who has stayed alive through four versions of the city knows how to offer, Layla drank it and let the burn coat her tongue. Tomorrow would be noisy. Tomorrow would try to be theater. She intended to make it a math problem with manners.\n\nOn a different roof across town, under a sky that did not mean the same thing to anyone who had not grown here, a woman in white watched a city that declined to be contained in the edges of any one story. Mireille set her glass down with the careful distaste of someone avoiding fingerprints and said to a man who liked being furniture in other people\u2019s rooms, \u201cShe presses. She is better than the last one. Tell them to stop playing at taps and dribbles. If they wish to embarrass her, they need to stop pretending they are artists and return to their own craft.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is our craft, Highness?\u201d the man asked, and if there was irony in the honorific he had doctored it into submission before it reached his tongue.\n\n\u201cPackaging,\u201d she said, and smiled with only her top lip. \u201cMake the mess look like a gift. Tie it with a bow. Send it to her with her own name on the card. If she opens it in public, we are not to blame.\u201d",

                              "content": "The first clue arrived with a bow so neat Hessa laughed when the porter wheeled it into the Pavilion\u2019s service bay. The paper was thick enough to use as a tray, the ribbon a white that had never met air. On the lid, in tasteful azure, someone had printed the Pavilion\u2019s signature hexagon pattern and, beneath it, Layla\u2019s initials with the crown so small you would miss it unless you wanted to hate her. The shipping labels were impeccable and unhelpful. The sender of record was a logistics firm that no one who worked for the logistics firm admitted existed, the way public bathrooms never acknowledge the ghosts that share their mirrors. The receiving clerk signed because people in uniforms sign when confronted with expensive-looking rectangles and confidence. By the time Yara stepped into the bay and tasted the air for the sour of something wrong, six more pallets had been rolled in by men who whistled not because they were happy but because the melody gave their guilt a tune.\n\n\u201cWho ordered a hundred of these?\u201d the clerk asked, only half apologetic, because if a thing has ribbon it must have approval. \u201cIt says Desert Bloom Home Starter. It says \u2018compliments of Her Highness.\u2019 It says \u2018unveil at luncheon\u2019. It says all the things.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt says trap,\u201d Yara murmured without moving her mouth, and Layla, who had arrived on the tail of the scent of manufactured lavender, felt an old classroom in her thigh muscles as if she had just been assigned a difficult problem with too much arithmetic and not enough paper. She circled the nearest box as if it might bolt. The print quality was too good, the UV varnish on the hexagon too precise, the crease on the ribbon moleculary arrogant. She found the seam with her fingernail, lifted, and let the lid confess.\n\nInside lay a curated green dream: compostable cutlery made of some smooth white that looked at first glance like bone and at second like sugar; cups stamped compost in a font so round it looked friendly; sachets of smart labels promising to make every household \u201ca hero\u201d by turning their daily waste into a game; a small glossy booklet with photographs of smiling brown children holding seedling trays as solemnly as prayers; and a card in a hand that imitated her own without understanding its restraint. \u201cTo our city,\u201d the card read. \u201cStart at home. With gratitude, L.\u201d It was the sort of thing people wanted her to have said, which made it more dangerous than if it had been outrageous.\n\nHessa lifted the booklet between two fingers as if removing a dead bee from a bowl of sugar. \u201cIf you were going to do this,\u201d she said dryly, \u201cyou would choose a different font. You are not a woman built of rounded edges.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I would not write \u2018with gratitude\u2019 like an aunt from Aswan,\u201d Layla said, scanning the booklet to see if they had stolen her words or simply their rhythm. The photographs were knife-sharp and almost emotionally accurate, which was worse. The cutlery claimed to be plant-based in five languages and carried a small footnote with the honesty of a sinner who has learned that confessions make friends: industrial composting required. The city did not have an industrial composter capable of chewing this polymer. The Pavilion\u2019s composters were worms and bacteria and heat and the kind of patience Layla had to pray for. This white, if fed to them, would gum their mouths and stifle their appetite. The cups boasted miraculous degradation in twelve weeks and carried a trademark of a company with two addresses and a lawyer for a receptionist. The smart labels were the real mouth. When Tariq glanced at one, the muscles around his eyes tightened in a way that meant he had discovered a cleverness he disliked.\n\n\u201cThey are NFCs,\u201d he murmured, turning the label over gently as if it might bruise. \u201cThey will talk to your phone when you do not ask them to. The default action is to open a web page and tally your heroics with stars and a confetti animation when you have sorted correctly. Charming and sticky. The page lives behind a content delivery network that is not here. The sort of architecture you rent when you want to be too big to trace. The tracking parameters include geotags and session IDs.\u201d He looked up and did not make a face because he had learned long ago that faces in the presence of problems can be used against you. \u201cThe first time someone uses one of these at home, it will send back their address, their button presses, and their habits. That could be benign. It is not benign when the front door says this came from you.\u201d\n\nBasim came at a jog that pretended to be a walk because cameras should never arrive sweaty. He took in the boxes in one sweep, the ribbon, the font, the clerks pretending not to have nerves, and his expression did a small, appreciative sigh that meant the day would be messy and his work would be good. \u201cIt is beautiful,\u201d he said, because beauty is often the first step in a crime, and took a photograph of the bow before any knife touched it. \u201cHow many?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne hundred,\u201d Yara said, already moving, already telling men with sleeves rolled to their elbows that the boxes should be moved away from the floor drains and the compost inlet and the blue bins marked plastic because accidents have an appetite for proximity. \u201cOne hundred, and our luncheon is in an hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd an hour is a lifetime when the person you are about to dine with wants you to trip over your own generosity,\u201d Hessa said. She peeled the label that tried to mimic Layla\u2019s monogram and held it to the light. There were microletters in the ribbon\u2019s edge. She had to fetch her new readers. The letters read, in tiny, smug font, H&H PACKAGING, a hawk\u2019s claw holding a hand barely visible unless you had been taught to see it. Hessa made a sound that might have been a swear if it had been another woman\u2019s mouth. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course they put their name on the bow. Men do love a flourish.\u201d\n\nLayla looked at the boys on the loading bay, at their new shoes and their careful posture and the way their eyes slid, ashamed to have brought a problem into a place their mothers admired. She crouched to be level with the nearest. \u201cWho brought you these?\u201d she asked, not a witch-hunt, not a trick. He blinked and swallowed and told her about a man in a tidy jacket who did not give a name and a van that did not have a license plate that would charm a police officer. The paperwork had been scanned and signed in a hallway that did not smell like this one; the signature had belonged to a woman in Purchasing who would swear she had never signed it and whose ballpoint pen had been stolen three days ago.\n\n\u201cWe could refuse and return,\u201d Yara said, voice clean as a blade. \u201cWe could issue a statement and make men chew their tongues on their way down the drive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could,\u201d Layla said, thinking of Mireille\u2019s mouth around a laugh at the falconer\u2019s perch, of the hawk and the hand playing at kindness and packaging the mess with a bow. \u201cOr we could open one in front of our guests. We could show them the truth of materials. We could make the room smarter and therefore harder to poison next time.\u201d\n\nHessa fixed her with Tante Eyes that had coaxed a generation into eating vegetables and apologizing properly. \u201cYou are going to unbox the trap like a performance,\u201d she said, both resigned and amused. \u201cYou are going to make a ritual of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cCeremony is how we nail truth to the floor,\u201d Layla said, and the old pleasure of being a girl in a closet with her sisters and a locked safe present and laughing under her breath came back, sweet as a fig. \u201cGet me a hot plate. Get me vinegar, salt, a beaker, an ice bowl. Get me one of the clear cylinders from the water docents; the ones with the laser-etched marks. Tariq, I want a burner profile for this white cutlery; what does it do when it meets flame at low, then high? Does it sweeten the air or make it sour? Does it curl like a lie or collapse like an apology? Basim, I will give you a picture to love. Do not make it pretty; make it obvious. And someone find me a tailor on Tahlia who sews with gold where no one will see, because I owe him a compliment.\u201d\n\nThe luncheon wanted to be a chorus. It had white chairs that had never learned humility and plates that expected to be reflected in other plates. The donors arrived with their bracelets disguised as watches, the ministers with their neckties disguised as personal taste, the foreign press with their smiles disguised as teeth. The Pavilion reflected them all back with its usual patience. Layla carried the first box to the stage and set it down as if it were one more offering to the city; the cameras clicked because novelty is a royalty of its own. Hessa stood behind her with a tray that had served princes and plumbers and made no distinction between them. On the tray: a small flame in a glass hood, a clear cylinder, a bowl of ice, a jug of water, a pinch of salt, a dish of vinegar, a lilac glove because jokes ease the parts of the brain that learn faster when they are not afraid. Tariq, offstage, whispered as if to a child who needed something to hold. \u201cFlame steady. Do not let it flare. The polymer is PLA with filler. Low heat, it will soften; high heat, it will char and release lactide that smells like waffles if you do not know better. The filler will give you ash. Vinegar will do nothing; salt will be cruel. The cup is a different beast. It will warp like pride and then sulk.\u201d\n\n\u201cFriends,\u201d Layla said, and Basim later would say the recording of that word saved them three days of bleeding. \u201cWelcome. Someone, kind or otherwise, brought us gifts. I am a woman who believes in generosity and in proof. Today, let\u2019s unwrap a kindness together and see what is inside.\u201d\n\nShe held the cutlery up and did not name the brand because brands are like demons and enjoy recognition. She pinched the fork where its throat would be if it were a living thing and held it over the small flame. It softened as predicted, looked penitent, then blackened at the edge with a humor that would have fooled a room less interested in truth. A small collective noise rose as the faux-sugar smell of sweet plastic slid into the noses of men who were not used to smelling anything other than spice and their own cologne. She held the fork\u2019s bowed head and touched it, gently, to the bowl of ice. It stiffened with theatrical righteousness, as single-use righteousness does when confronted with the cold. She dunked it in the cylinder of water and watched an oil-slick shimmer gather around its wound.\n\n\u201cThis is compostable,\u201d she said, not accusing, not soft. \u201cIf you own an industrial composter. We do not. Not yet. At home, even at scale, this will become a tantrum in your soil. We will not feed it to our worms. They work too hard to teach them bitterness. We will not feed it to the sea. The sea is already tired of our excuses. We will teach our suppliers to print bigger footnotes and to sell us the thing we can actually digest.\u201d\n\nShe set the coy polymer aside and picked up the smart label as if it were a fig leaf and she was not interested in the tree. \u201cThis sticker will gamify your virtue,\u201d she said, smiling because sometimes you must be bright to cut. \u201cIt will award you stars. It will share your habits with a server in a country that enjoys watching you try. Today, we will teach it to applaud something else.\u201d She tapped her phone to the label and the Pavilion\u2019s captive mirror caught the handshake and fed it a page Tariq had prepared that looked like the one it expected\u2014thumbs up, confetti, a goat who had learned to wink\u2014and, beneath it, in letters clean enough to teach a child to write, a sentence that said, Our homes are not theaters; we will not be measured without consent. The confetti fell anyway, because confetti is cheap and appetites are not. Someone laughed in a way that made the room forgive itself for having almost been made into a measuring device.\n\nShe poured vinegar into the cylinder and sprinkled salt and let the room smell like a kitchen instead of a gala. She spoke about labels and ladders and the difference between promises and processes. When she cursed greenwashing she did it politely, in Arabic that made even her disapproval sound like an elegant aunt. When she said we, she meant it, because she had been the one to sign contracts in good faith and the one to untie knots in bad. By the time she set the ribbon back on the box and handed it to Hessa as if they were taking a dessert into the staff room to be eaten secretly where no one could be offended, the room had learned three new things: never trust white cutlery that calls itself plant-based in small letters; never trust stickers that give you stars for doing what your grandmother already taught you; and never again leave a ribbon unexamined in a house that has decided to bother itself.\n\nBasim\u2019s photographs did what photographs can do when they have the right hands guiding them; he caught her mouth laughing while black polymer stuck between her gloves like spun sugar, he caught Hessa\u2019s shawl turned into shade and then into weapon and then into love, he caught a donor who had been born old and the moment he looked young because learning made him so. The headlines that might have been unkind did not get a chance to be cruel; the internet, presented with a woman burning a fork in a crystal room, chose to be entertained by accuracy.\n\nBehind the stage, the back-of-house had its own performance. Yara followed the delivery men who were now very interested in becoming invisible. She knew which hallway made men feel that a good lie was possible and chose the other. In the loading bay she came up behind a driver whose sleeve hem had been repaired with a flash of gold that did not show unless you knelt to tie your shoe. She pointed at his seam as if admiring a flower and said, \u201cTahlia?\u201d He flinched because guilt recognizes the names of streets the way lovers recognize the names of scars. He said he did not know how to read; she said she did not need him to read to tell her how much he had been paid. He told her the truth because her voice promised to be a kinder place than the lie.\n\nThe pickup order in his glove compartment had been printed on cheap stock that had pretended to be expensive. It named a suite in the Aftan as origin; it also named a basement room in a building on an outer ring road where ghosts are rented by the hour. It had a reference that made Tariq\u2019s eyebrows go up when she photographed it and sent it to his hungry machines. DB-Home Starter, the code read. The small letters under it read H&H Unit Q3; the smallest letters read trial one. The careless flourish of the hawk\u2019s icon winked at the bottom of the page like a man who has told a joke he thinks is not just clever but kind. Yara let the driver go with a warning that carried an invitation to honesty the next time money met him after dark. She took the seam with her by cutting it with her small pocket blade and kept the gold shred because habits like this deserved cataloguing.\n\nNabil texted a smiling face at the exact moment Layla needed him to and then came himself later, which was better. He had the look of a man who has realized he is not at the center of the story but can earn a footnote that will keep him from being humbled at family gatherings. He stood beside Layla at the press table and co-signed a statement that Hessa had written in a tone that made people think they had chosen to be better. \u201cEffective immediately,\u201d it read, \u201cthe Pavilion and its partners will refuse any materials not labeled for the actual systems available to us. We will publish those systems in plain language. We will work with suppliers to stop lying to themselves and then to us; we will shift our budget from ribbon to rope and pull people up instead of wrapping boxes.\u201d The foreign press liked the rope line; the domestic papers liked the small nod to cousin procurement implied in the confession. Nobody liked being made to feel stupid by a fork, which was useful.\n\nMireille watched from a hotel room that had been designed to look like restraint. The footage of Layla setting plant-plastic to a flame and refusing confetti made her laugh in a key that suggested honest amusement had elbowed past contempt to sit down for a minute. She poured a drink she did not finish and told a man who had flown in from a country that owned more copper than it could digest to stop letting junior operatives play with water when all they knew was how to package air. \u201cWe are not artists,\u201d she said, the consonants in her mouth like ice. \u201cOur craft is presentation. The thing must look like a gift; it must feel like a favor; it must be the recipient\u2019s own voice telling them to open it in public. This was clumsy. I despise clumsy.\u201d She pinched the bridge of her nose in a gesture she had learned from an aunt who had raised her on rooms full of other people\u2019s opinions. \u201cTell them to try again. Or better: tell them to wait. She is teaching her city, and you cannot embarrass a woman who has chosen to be seen learning.\u201d\n\nIn the long shadow of afternoon, the salvage yard smelled like rain that had failed to arrive three days ago and had left the promise of it as a residue. Layla stood with the Uncle among refrigerators who had been faithful friends and bicycles who had known joy and disappointment in equal measure. She showed him the ribbon and the microletters that bragged more than they intended and the gold thread from the driver\u2019s seam. He snorted softly, the way men snort when they see the footprints of a lie that has tried to hide itself with perfume and has forgotten mud tells stories too. He named the tailor on Tahlia without using his shop\u2019s name; he named him by the way he stitched and the tea he served to men who could not pay for alterations they needed to save face. He told Layla to be kind to him because he had sons who did not always say no when a cousin called.\n\n\u201cI am always kind if it will fit,\u201d she said, and he grunted as if to say kindness is a garment you stretch without tearing when you can and fold away when you cannot.\n\nThe tailor had soft hands and tired eyes and a wife who did not like the way certain customers leaned across his counter. He recognized the gold thread at once, as if Layla had held up a lock of hair. He did not pretend not to know what she meant when she asked if he had sewn a jacket for a man whose sleeve would have needed this particular mercy last night. He weighed a small lie on his tongue, found it bitter, spat it out. \u201cHe is a nephew,\u201d he said, and his accent put an old city in the middle of his consonants. \u201cHe is a good boy when he is not working for his cousin. He carried a box that looked expensive; he said it was for good. I cannot choose his work for him, but I can decide not to finish the hem next time unless he tells me the truth.\u201d\n\nLayla left a bill she could afford on the counter because she had not come to buy anything and had borrowed a little dignity instead. The tailor pressed it back with the back of his fingers and said, embarrassed and stubborn, \u201cLet me pay for the shame I would have felt if you had left money on my table after asking me to be brave.\u201d She took it as instruction. Outside she stood in heat that had learned not to be cruel for three minutes and let herself feel the hard shape of habits, domestic and imported, rubbing together until they made sparks. She was tired enough to laugh if someone had made a very specific kind of joke. No one did, which was a mercy.\n\nAt the Palace that night, the envelope on the table by the garden door had the agreeable weight of paper that expects its contents to be treated as an event. Hessa would have let it sit until morning because patience is a sport she plays better than Layla, but Yara picked it up and shook it in a way that would have given a lesser letter a bruise. Inside was a small bell, the kind that hangs from a falcon\u2019s jess, silver and needlessly pretty. Alongside it lay a list of names typed on a machine set to a font that tried to look official and failed because it had been chosen by a man who had learned taste from catalogs. The names were not government. They were the men who change locks when nobody asks, the men who write routing codes when someone says the word \u201cstreamline\u201d in a room that smells like coffee and ambition, the men who own trucks that move things that are never weighed. At the bottom, in a small, tidy hand that was almost familiar if you had met it with a different sentence, someone had written: You will open this in private because you are careful. Consider it a favor, not a gift. Consider returning it when you are done. M.\n\nHessa, reading over her shoulder, made a noise that could have been derision or respect depending on the angle. \u201cShe has learned how to play you,\u201d she said. \u201cNot by injury. By opportunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is not wrong,\u201d Layla said, rolling the bell in her palm until it warmed and sang a little without being asked to. \u201cI will teach my city faster with this than without. I will salt it with lies because I like to know whether my soup is being tasted by a thief. I will not thank her.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will thank yourself,\u201d Yara said, setting tea on the table and not pretending she was not listening. \u201cThat is better sport. And you will return this list in a different envelope.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith ribbon,\u201d Saffiyah called from the far sofa where she was making a necklace out of the abandoned smart labels because she never let pretty things go to waste even if they were spying on you. \u201cA big ribbon, so she can choke on it if she chooses.\u201d\n\nLayla laughed then, properly, because sisters are fences that tell you where the garden ends and the dark begins. She sat, finally, and let the dark get her ankles while the bell made its small honest sound in her palm. Tomorrow she would call the men on the list and ask them for help in the tone that makes men obey because they like to think they are helpful. Tomorrow she would feed the hawk\u2019s mirror a story it would enjoy and then close the window slowly, like a polite host who walks a guest to the door and makes sure their car is really gone before locking it. Tomorrow she would send a package of her own with paper that did not lie and a note that said less than it meant. Tonight she ate the last sambusa and let the city\u2019s hum rethread the tired parts of her until they fit again.\n\nMorning arrived wearing a breeze that had pretended affection and settled for civility. The boxes had been stacked in a storeroom where their arrogance would not rub off on anything else, labels catalogued, ribbons cut and kept because Hessa had decided they would one day make a useful rope in a pinch. The Pavilion shrugged off the theatrics and returned to being a building that made water out of light and discipline. The first school tour of the day moved past the waste stations with fresh confidence; the children tapped the smart labels that now linked to a page that taught them how to smell a lie and then gave them a printable certificate that said You are harder to fool than a ribbon, which made teachers smile for the rest of the day. In the control room, the loop fed the hawk the old day again, and if someone noticed that the goat winked with its left eye instead of its right today, they did not take the trouble to be suspicious.\n\nThe men on the list answered their phones with three different varieties of defensiveness and two of charm. Layla did not speak like a prosecutor. She asked them to help write a policy that would make their lives easier in the long run by refusing to reroute calls through ghost switchboards. She spoke to their vanity and their fatigue in equal measure. She scheduled a meeting in a room with bad coffee and good chairs because good chairs make men imagine they are making history. While she was on her second call, Tariq slipped a printout under her hand the way a waiter who knows your favorite dish appears when you have not looked up from your argument. The QR that had smiled confetti the day before, when called properly without a mirror, now resolved to a low-resolution video of Layla at a podium endorsing the Home Starter kit in exactly the tone of moral calm that had made people trust her. Her mouth moved in phrases she had used in other rooms; the audio did not precisely match. The edit made her sound flatter and less funny and more like a saint, which was how you knew it was not her.\n\n\u201cIt went live for forty minutes on an Avaloran page,\u201d Tariq said, which in his language meant he had already pulled it from five different servers and had an archivist in Belgium preparing to copy the copy. \u201cThey pulled it when your polymer burned. It would have done work if it had an hour. There is a watermark in one corner visible only if you squint like an uncle. The watermark is the name of a boutique PR firm that sold a man we both have met a campaign two years ago about helmets that did nothing to prevent concussions and everything to move product. The man did not learn. The firm did.\u201d\n\n\u201cSend them flowers,\u201d Layla said, without lifting her eyes from the paper in which a man named Ghassan explained, kindly and condescendingly, that rerouting numbers is a harmless way to prevent the important from being interrupted. \u201cSend them a basket of figs with a card that says, \u2018We saw your edit and appreciated your work on the room tone. We would like you to consult on a children\u2019s program about media literacy.\u2019 Basim will photograph the basket going in and the receptionist not knowing whether to smile. Then forget their name for a month while we build something that cannot be prettied into a worse version of itself.\u201d\n\nAt noon the falconers arrived with three birds and a boy new to the work who could not stop smiling long enough to tie a knot. Hessa took him aside and taught him to breathe in a way that steadied his fingers and his future, which is exactly what an aunt does when she knows she cannot catch the bird for you. In the afternoon, Layla walked into a room that had been arranged for the men who were the hand, not the hawk, and found them willing, if not immediately able, to admit that they preferred being asked to be better to being called thieves. She bought them time by spending her own and made them write down a list of the numbers they had given out as favors to make themselves necessary. She kept the paper and gave them a promise that if they called her the next time someone asked for a back door she would answer even if she was at a wedding.\n\nIn the evening, on a terrace that had never learned humility because it had never been asked to sit with plumbers, Mireille removed her shoes and put her feet on a tile that had been baked by men who would never know her name. She held the falcon\u2019s bell Layla had returned with a ribbon twice as big as the first and read the card. It said only, Package accepted. Ribbon retained. She laughed in a way that startled a small, honest smile out of the woman bringing her tea. \u201cShe will be annoying,\u201d she said to the tea. \u201cI will enjoy it.\u201d Then she set the bell down beside her and stopped touching it because nostalgia was the only thing she allowed herself to almost indulge and no more.\n\nWhen the sun stopped pretending to be gentle and went to hide its leftover fire behind the skyline, Layla climbed to the roof and lay flat because roofs tell the truth. Yara put the fan on her face and did not speak for the time it took a satellite to cross the sky. The city hummed like an engine that had not been trusted in a long time and had decided to be reliable anyway. Somewhere a box that looked like a gift sat on a shelf and gathered dust and humility. Somewhere a ribbon was being tied around a story that would not survive the room it had been designed to embarrass. Somewhere in a house that did not please her, a woman in white considered whether sewing a habit into a silk dress was possible without the scratch showing. Layla, in gray, with ash on her gloves and oil on her heart, decided to sleep before she learned what the next package would hold, because mornings are better friends when you treat them tenderly at night.",

Layla woke to messages stacked like bread on a tray she had not ordered. One showed water the color of tea running from a tap in a clinic near Wadi Laban; a caption claimed the Pavilion\u2019s lines had backflowed poison into a charity\u2019s sink. Another was a voice note in a mother\u2019s breathless register asking if babies should be bathed in bottled water until the government remembered how to be ashamed. She let her phone lie on the pillow while she made her wudu because sometimes ritual is the only way to lay a pathway through noise. By the time she pressed her forehead to the mat, the ache in her chest had arranged itself into tasks. She rose with a mouth that tasted like oath and mint.\n\nHessa had already found her sandals and a scarf that made Layla look more aunt than princess, which was a shape that made people tell the truth faster. Yara had the car at the side entrance, her clipboard empty on purpose because she preferred to take notes in the corner of her head where no one could subpoena them. Tariq climbed in backward because he refused to buy a bag that would fit all his cables and he always looked like a crow that had fallen in love with string. The city at this hour was the sound of thin commerce and thick prayer. A boy with a crate of rolls on his head crossed in front of them with all the gravity of a prophet who had discovered butter.\n\nAt the clinic a little crowd had already grafted itself onto the door, each person with a question ballooned into a theory by the heat. The tap ran brown into a metal bowl that had lost its shine from too many scrubbings. It smelled like fear and tannin, not sewage, which was a difference only a certain kind of nose bothers to respect. A nurse with henna faded to humility on her hands stood like a fence between two goats that insisted the other had eaten the garden. Layla stepped into the doorway and said peace in a tone that mothers use when their children can still hear the old rules behind the new noise. The nurse blinked, said Layla\u2019s name, and then stopped saying names because the room had started to tether itself to her quiet.\n\n\u201cShow me the tank,\u201d Layla asked, and the nurse laughed once in relief because anyone who asked for the tank had to be a person who knew water is a journey before it is a drink. They climbed the stairs that had memorized a century of slippers. On the roof the sun had already begun to push shoulders; the storage cylinders sat in their shade cages like obedient sea creatures taken inland. Tariq knocked the side of one gently and listened to its answer; Yara ran a palm along the lock of the cage and found it notched with a tool that had not been made for kindness. The hatch on the nearest tank wore a bandage of tape that had been torn by a left hand. Inside, floating like a joke played by a mean uncle, a clear sachet swelled with something that bled brown when you whispered heat at it.\n\n\u201cIt is tea concentrate,\u201d Tariq said softly, because his grandmother had taught him to tell the difference between food dye and something you should put into a story for the police. He fished the sachet out with a gloved hand and held it up to the light. The hawk\u2019s icon did not dare to show itself this time; the seam told its own story. The polymer would dissolve in an hour on a hot day; it would leave behind no poison, only a hundred mothers\u2019 panic. It was the sort of sabotage that thinks itself clever because it does not murder. It only pokes faith and watches it bruise.\n\nLayla asked Yara for the clear cylinder she had used on the stage and the little flame she had refused to travel without since yesterday because people learn from the same shapes even if the lesson is different. She lit the flame; she filled the cylinder with water from the tank after they had ladled the brown out and closed the hatch with a hairpin she had pulled from her sleeve. She looked around at the cluster of bodies edging into a congregation and waited until they were quiet without asking. Then she took the sachet and slit it with a woman\u2019s joke of a knife.\n\n\u201cThis is a prank that thinks it is a plan,\u201d she said. \u201cIt frightens because we love our children. It will not make anyone sick. Do not let anyone make money from your fear. Watch.\u201d She dissolved a thread of the concentrate into the water and it obeyed by becoming pretty in the way amber can be when it traps nothing but light. She poured a measure into a second cylinder with a filter that had been designed for hiking and for poor plumbing. The filtered water came out clear enough to embarrass the tea without insulting the tea\u2019s mother. Basim, who had learned to arrive with a camera when the air smelled like someone else\u2019s agenda, took a picture that made the brown look ashamed and the clear look like an answer.\n\n\u201cWhoever climbed your roof is a coward,\u201d Hessa said, loud enough for the men at the back with the phones to record her eyebrows. \u201cThey did not trust their own argument, so they borrowed yours. Come by the Pavilion later and have coffee. We will send you home with a filter if you need one, and if your landlord tells you to mind your gender and stop asking him for modernity, send him to me. I am the right gender for the conversation.\u201d\n\nThe children clustered near the doorway didn\u2019t understand the politics but understood the kindness because kindness and clarity braid in the same place in a child\u2019s mind. Layla let a little girl hold the pouch so she could feel mischief that had lost its costume. She told an uncle in a blue shirt how to watch a tanker fill his building\u2019s tanks without accepting a bribe and losing the disinfectant dose. She made everyone look at the rivet on the cage, made them memorize the way an honest one sat flush and a tampered one wore new scratches like vanity, and if she sounded like someone\u2019s grandmother in the telling, it did not injure her pride. The crowd dissolved into pairs walking side by side because problem solving returns people to their errands. A boy shouted that the Princess made the water do a trick; a woman corrected gently that the water had been fine and the trick had been the lie.\n\nOn the ride back, surface streets thick with men who believed horns were punctuation, Layla\u2019s phone chimed with a voice she would have recognized in a field of ten thousand. The imam of the clinic\u2019s neighborhood had sent a note that he would preach patience and plague stories at noon, the old ones where Moses had to tell people that grief can drown you even in a desert. She thanked him and asked if he would let her sit quietly in the back row because she did better work when reminded of what nothing human can improve upon. He sent her an emoji of a date palm that made her throat ache with the simplicity of being invited.\n\nThe list that had come with the bell sat on her desk like a tame thing trying not to remember it was born feral. She and Hessa salted it with three lies so neatly that even Yara admired their stitches. Two names were moved to the top that did not deserve it; one number was swapped for another that would not pick up because the owner had a dentist appointment he would tell his cousin about when it began to hurt. They called six men before lunch and invited them to a \u201cquiet technical consultation at the Pavilion\u201d with soup, bread, and a chance to speak without being quoted, three things that can make even a liar tell the truth faster than a subpoena. Four agreed with relief because they wanted to stop doing something they could not quite name. One refused because he understood that being better sometimes makes you less rich, and he had not made his peace with that sacrament. The last did not answer, which Layla wrote down as a yes in the column marked later.\n\nMireille sent roses. They arrived in a crate that had crossed two borders without bruising a single petal. The note was handwritten in a script that had been taught by a governess with a velvet ruler. \u201cFor your stagecraft,\u201d it read. \u201cI almost preferred your fire, but even I know a woman cannot choose the same weapon twice and keep an audience.\u201d Layla snorted, which in her was a small sound; Saffiyah pinned one of the roses in her own hair and pretended she didn\u2019t care that it made her look crownless and royal at once. Yara untied the ribbon like a patient snake charmer and shook out the microletters hidden in the satin. They read nothing this time, which was their own kind of confession.\n\n\u201cInvite her to a wash day,\u201d Saffiyah suggested, wicked sweetness in her smile. \u201cIn the old city. The women will teach her what waste means when you have only three buckets and more clothes than patience. We will stand in the courtyard and drink sweet tea and make her think we are joking while we arrange her soul in a drawer she did not know she had.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will, but not now,\u201d Layla said, looking at her schedule and feeling the itch of the afternoon\u2019s meeting with the hand that had not learned to be quiet yet. \u201cToday we sew men to policies and ask them to admire the fit.\u201d\n\nThe consultation room they had claimed for the afternoon was a lovely lie of a space\u2014indirect light, a carpet that softened a man\u2019s calves into thinking he was safe, chairs that forgave you for slouching. The men came with their phones face down as if that would make them less guilty and their pens at the ready as if policy were a shopping list. Ghassan was among them, which pleased Layla because she had been composing a conversation with him in a quiet corner of her mind for three days. He had a good voice for television and a worse voice for apologies. He wore his wedding ring two notches too loose because he liked to spin it while appearing thoughtful, and it clicked against the table when he did not catch it, which told her more than she needed about a certain week two years ago.\n\nShe did not begin with accusation; she began with a story about a grandmother who boiled every pot not for distrust but for method, because habit sits heavier than fear and makes fewer mistakes. She showed them the sachet and the bow, the seam and the microletters. She told them about the boy with the bitten finger and the driver with the gold thread. She asked them to write, in their own hands, the words I will not reroute a call without my supervisor\u2019s signature and my name beneath, and then to sign as if signature were a sacrament. Men who do not fear courts sometimes fear stationery sets. The pens scratched. The soup cooled. The bread broke into hands old enough to have understood that drama is tiring and maintenance is underrated. When she turned to Ghassan, she did not say his name with extra polish or demand that the room watch him swallow something unpleasant. She did not need to.\n\n\u201cI am not the hawk,\u201d he said, before she could ask. \u201cI did not stamp a hand on your house. I took a call I should not have. I allowed a cousin to impress me. I am tired of cousins, Layla.\u201d He rubbed his ring, and it clicked again. \u201cTell me where to put them so they cannot press themselves onto my mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cSend them to the Salvage Uncle on a Friday,\u201d Layla said, because sometimes the answer is not a firing but a humble errand. \u201cIf they can find a use for a broken oscillating fan and an incomplete ladder without bribing anyone, hire them. If they cannot, make them carry the fan and the ladder back to the man they took them from and apologize. Also, give me their numbers. The phone is the cousin you think you can manage, and that is your error.\u201d\n\nAfter the men left, lighter because their pockets were heavier with agreements they understood, Basim slid into the doorway with the sort of grin that made his mother tired and his editor proud. He had visited the Avaloran art event in Layla\u2019s place because she had sent him and because he knew, better than anyone, how to look like furniture and remember every conversation that happened over him. He put three photographs on the table with the flourish of a magician ending the trick he never announced. One showed a room with walls the exact color of money, a projection of water cast on a wall as if liquid would enjoy being turned into a backdrop. One showed a woman whose face you might recognize from a balcony and whose dress was cut to make you forget her name. The third showed Mireille with a glass she did not finish, a tilt to her head that suggested she was uninstalling the patience she had affixed for public. The man she spoke with had a napkin folded very precisely and a bruise along the edge of his jaw that had been powdered without skill.\n\n\u201cHe is the PR boutique owner,\u201d Basim said, tapping the picture where a ring should have been and was not. \u201cHe asked me if we were hiring cameramen at the Pavilion, as if cameras were weapons one could buy and point. He recommended himself like a man offering a knife in a kitchen while a cake is in the oven.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you take his knife?\u201d Hessa asked, amused and not.\n\n\u201cI told him we were looking for aunties from old neighborhoods to run our comments section,\u201d Basim said primly. \u201cHe laughed like he understood humor and then asked me if I knew what NFC stood for. I told him it stood for No Free Confetti.\u201d\n\nThe slow mirror that had been savoring its own cleverness twitched in Tariq\u2019s ear at dusk. The hawk\u2019s mouth asked an old question with a new urgency: status of east gallery suppression. The loop answered sweetly with yesterday\u2019s manners. Meanwhile the west wing\u2019s humidity sensor saw a number that did not belong to this climate and sighed with confusion. Somewhere, not far, a junior tried a command in a foreign console that would have been elegant had it been written for the right infrastructure. The foam did not release; it thought about releasing for exactly one breath and then blushed and took it back. Layla put her palm on the valve casing as if touching a heart through a coat and told it, firmly, that it was loved and would not embarrass the woman who had been good to it. Hessa rolled her eyes and pretended she did not believe in talking to pipes while sliding pastries into a tin for the security guards who were terrible at packing their own dinners.\n\nAt the small mosque behind the salvage yard, where the fan makes a noise only the men in the back row pretend not to mind, Layla waited after maghrib for the man whose name she had not written on paper when M had offered it. Ghassan came doubly tired: tired from the meeting where he had confessed he had a cousin problem, and tired from the knowledge that he would now have to walk through a door he had paid for but never imagined he would enter. He sat with her on the edge of a courtyard where a plant decided whether it would bloom this year or punish its owner for forgetting to speak kindly to it in spring.\n\n\u201cI am not your enemy,\u201d he said, surprising them both by choosing the simplest sentence a man can choose when he has been wrong. \u201cI am not your friend either, but I am a man you can place in a doorway and expect at least to ask who is entering.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will do more than ask,\u201d Layla said, and she did not soften the edge because his ring had already softened everything that needed gentling. \u201cYou will turn away men who borrow the Pavilion\u2019s name to get their boxes delivered faster. You will tell me before you tell your cousin when a foreign company dressed as a local one asks for our dirt beneath their rope. You will eat lunch in your office twice a week without guests until you learn what the room sounds like when it is not trying to sell you something.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are very domestic in your punishments,\u201d he muttered, and it might have been a complaint or an admiration. \u201cFine. I will be bored in the service of your virtue. But when you are tired of being virtuous, call me. I will take you somewhere vulgar and we will laugh at men who think their cars make them undrownable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have Yara for that,\u201d Layla said, and the man\u2019s laugh was honest, which boded well for his future under her stern wing.\n\nBy the time she reached the Palace, Riyadh had put on its night jewelry and decided to be forgiven for the heat of the day. The list on her desk had sprouted little ticks beside names; the bell lay quiet in its dish as if the falcon were asleep and dreaming of mice who apologized. Saffiyah leaned on the doorway and read a complaint on her phone about the Pavilion\u2019s \u201chostility to innovation\u201d from a man who had patented a recyclable napkin that dissolved when you needed it most. She read it in a voice that made Layla feel fourteen and safe and annoyed at once. Basim sent a photo of a little boy in a Messi shirt explaining to his grandmother that labels can lie, and the grandmother making a face that said she already knew and had been waiting for the world to catch up with her.\n\n\u201cAre you going to make a festival?\u201d Yara asked, dropping a handful of borrowed screws on the desk because leaving them in her pocket was how her washing machine had become an enemy. \u201cBecause everything in your head smells like tents and bad coffee and the good kind of noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Layla said, letting the picture grow out loud so it would be real. \u201cAn Open Bids Bazaar. Nothing polished. No velvet ropes. The vendors will sit on rugs and tell us what their products do and we will test them in front of everyone. We will have scales and magnifying glasses and children with stopwatches. We will pay for the things that admit their limitations; we will refuse the things that only admit their colors. We will buy the men doing small right work a kabsa and put their names on the screen. It will be a fair where the prize is a contract and the punishment is embarrassment that does not make me happy but does make us better.\u201d\n\nHessa nodded in the way she did when she saw her mother\u2019s hands in her niece\u2019s movements. She took a ribbon out of the drawer and cut it neatly in half with scissors that had never learned to lie. She tied one piece around the bell so it would tattle when anyone moved it; she tucked the other into her bag, because a woman can always use ribbon when she wants to be generous and dangerous in the same hour. The cat in the courtyard chose that moment to fling itself at a moth with more hope than skill. It missed in a spectacular fashion that made even Yara\u2019s mouth soften with admiration. The moth flew away to tell worse jokes. The cat licked its paw in a manner that said it had meant to do that.\n\nOn the roof, where the city\u2019s breath is a different tune than at street level, Layla lay flat and let the old concrete take her weight and pretend to be her mother. She did not talk at first because talking sometimes takes away strength and she wanted to hoard strength like a fruit that will not be in season next month. Yara sat cross-legged and and adjusted the small fan so it kissed Layla\u2019s face. The breeze was not a breeze so much as a truce between heat and night. It was a good truce, made in good faith.\n\n\u201cI am afraid,\u201d Layla said finally, the words not falling so much as making a place for themselves beside her. \u201cNot of the hawk. Not of the hand. Of becoming a story I cannot control and a woman I do not like. Of making my city into a mirror that reflects my ambition instead of the laylines beneath it that belong to people older and younger than me. Of waking and finding we have built something that looks beautiful and behaves cruel.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are afraid of being effective,\u201d Yara said lightly, which in her meant gently. \u201cThat is an honest fear. People who are not afraid of being effective are dangerous in the wrong direction. You are afraid and you are stubborn. We will use the fear as coolant and the stubbornness as an engine. We will rest on roofs and pray on mats and throw forks into flames until men stop selling us sugar that cannot rot.\u201d She stretched her legs, ballet-quiet, the way she always did when a day\u2019s fighting could be put down without being ashamed. \u201cAnd when you try a stupid plan, I will pull you back by your scarf and you will swear at me and I will accept the insult because I have earned it.\u201d\n\nLayla laughed and it didn\u2019t sound like a concession so much as an amen. The stars were cowry shells tonight if you tilted your head just so; the moon had chosen to keep its counsel. Somewhere far off, a siren sang for a reason that had nothing to do with her and everything to do with the kind of city that contained all the versions of a person in one block. She folded the day into a square as her grandmother had folded dishtowels and slid it into the drawer where she kept other days\u2019 edges. The wind moved and did not promise anything except to come back if the buildings made a path for it. In the morning, Riyadh would want to be persuaded again. That was the job. That was the joy.",

                              "content": "The day of the Bazaar arrived with the brightness of a new coin, the kind people turn over in their palms while pretending not to be charmed by it. The courtyard outside the Pavilion had shed its gala skin and put on a market\u2019s, rugs unfurled like patient carpets that remembered feet, poles strung with shade cloths in blues and browns that flattered the light instead of fighting it. The salvage yard Uncle arrived in a shirt ironed to the bravery of cotton, his hands empty and useful, and stood at the gate like a border marker that told everyone what kind of country they were entering. Girls from the university arrayed themselves behind a long table of clipboards and stopwatches and magnifying glasses as if about to perform a surgery on promises. Aunties from three neighborhoods came bearing Tupperware full of dates and sternness and the kind of laughter that can stitch a room closed when it tears. If a man had wanted to risk selling a lie here, he would have had to lower his eyes in a way that hurt.\n\nVendors pitched tents that made their products look like polite guests at a cousin\u2019s wedding. The small men with the stubborn inventions were early, unloading hose attachments and modular gaskets and filters with packaging that had been designed by an old neighbor rather than an agency. The glossy men came later, carrying cases that smelled faintly of airports and intent, their pitch rehearsed to land on the rhythm of applause. Yara\u2019s crew ghosted among them in slate and sand colors, all smiles and inventory tags, offering water and taking photographs of the insides of boxes in a way that looked like hospitality and functioned like audit. Tariq set his little sensors under tables and on the back legs of chairs as if they were invitations to a children\u2019s party that happened to keep their network clean.\n\nLayla had forgotten how much joy there is in arranging a room where people expect to be treated fairly. She stood at the entrance, shawl pinned with her grandmother\u2019s falcon bell turned into a brooch, and watched the city arrive with its elbows out and its eyes bright. She had imagined the day like a liturgy, rituals and call-and-response, and the plan slipped over the fact with gratifying snugness. The sorting station at the edge of the courtyard wore signs hand-lettered by the very serious girls from the university with jokes tucked under information like napkins under plates. A chalkboard read: If your product claims \u201ccompostable,\u201d please bring your own worms or borrow ours. Hessa sat at a wooden table with a bowl of lemons and a knife, performing the sacrament of slicing in an intimidatingly tidy fashion, because nothing was allowed to be sour unless it had been invited to be.\n\n\u201cBells?\u201d the salvage Uncle asked, nodding at Layla\u2019s brooch with the cautious admiration of a man who remembers the old rules and likes when the new ones include a familiar sound. \u201cYou plan to ring the good ones or the liars?\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth,\u201d Layla said, fastening a ribbon on the Uncle\u2019s wrist that would identify him as a judge to those who needed labels to respect a person. \u201cThe good ones get a bell on their booth to tell people how to find them next week. The liars get their bells rung in their ears right in front of everyone until they learn to at least lie in the direction of decency.\u201d\n\nBy ten, the courtyard throbbed with the kind of noise that means people think they are doing something together that will stick. The first demonstration belonged to a man who had spent five years inventing a valve that hiccupped at the exact right moment to save a liter of water every time someone washed their hands. He stood with his eyes in the safe middle distance people choose when they have already been laughed at by someone who didn\u2019t know how to listen. Layla asked him to show her the hiccup. He did, with a dignity that made the slight pause in the stream feel like a bow. The Auntie from Wadi Namar ran her palm under the water twice, nodded once, and declared in the voice of a woman telling a child to take his nap that this one could come to her daughter\u2019s house. The crowd clapped in the way that takes nothing away from a man who has earned it and gives him a little room inside his chest to breathe better.\n\nThe glossy men fared differently. A representative from a company that claimed to have redesigned trash bags out of algae delivered a speech that had clearly been designed to be delivered beside a waterfall. Layla dipped the bag in Tariq\u2019s makeshift vat; it stretched handsomely and then dissolved into a mucous defeat that made the front row gasp. \u201cSalt,\u201d she said mildly, stirring, \u201cis not a waterfall.\u201d The representative recovered gamely, promising a new formula in Q4 with quiet urgency, and a student with eyeliner like armor made a note on a card with three checkboxes: works now, feeds worms now, tells the truth now. She ticked none of them and wrote: pretty; try again.\n\nAt a corner table, an old man from Qassim with a quiet laugh presented bars of soap that had been formulated to lather with less water and rinse faster. He had brought his granddaughter to pour measured beakers of water over hands in front of a line of children so solemn Saffiyah threatened her mascara by grinning too widely. The soap did as promised, slipping off the skin with grace and leaving behind the smell of lemons and labor. Layla bought the entire case for the clinic at Wadi Laban without making a speech about it, which was its own speech.\n\nBy noon the Open Bids Bazaar had a hum that made the hair along Tariq\u2019s arm lift in that old way because the city was, for once, choosing its future in a way that requested his competence without demanding his adrenaline. The magnifying glasses found the microletters on a ribbon attached to a set of \u201csmart drains\u201d that claimed to detect oil, and those letters, when examined under the Aunties\u2019 collective patience, read H&H with a flourish it thought was modest. Layla did not toss the box into the kind of bin that men build for drama and call decisive; she untaped it neatly and made a small tower of its contents and used the power of ridicule sparingly because ridicule is a hard water that leaves a residue you spend years scrubbing off the room. She told the vendor he was welcome to stay and watch people test the competitors; she told the audience that a company that must hide its name in a place only a magnifying glass can see is a company not yet ready to be worthy of the work they are about to do. The vendor did not leave, which was encouraging; he asked for a glass of water and wrote down the name of the soap man with a face that said he would like to have grandchildren clap for him one day too.\n\nHessa announced a break in the testing with an authority that made even the wind adjust its angle. She passed out slices of lemon on a plate to make hands smell like kitchens instead of products, and offered every judge a date at the exact moment you might be tempted to be ungenerous. The football goalkeeper arrived in a fluster of teenage boys and aunties who had grown up watching him save reputations with the same elegance he saved shots. He signed the letter to the father who did not want to be the lone recycler on his street with a flourish that was almost a prayer, and when Layla pressed it into the man\u2019s palm two hours later, she watched his jaw find dignity again. He looked at her as if she had given him a favor he would not waste; he promised his daughter out loud, in the embarrassing tone of a father trying not to cry, that he would be the first to put the bottle in the right mouth every single day this week. The daughter rolled her eyes with love turned inside out and pretended to be unbothered while she slid the signed letter into a plastic sleeve like a talisman.\n\nThe envelope arrived the way bad ideas do at weddings\u2014too late to be stopped without making a scene and too early to be ignored. It tucked itself under a stack of vendor cards on Layla\u2019s table with the careful illegality of a man who has practiced this trick since his uncle taught him how to fold paper around cash so no one could smell it. Yara\u2019s hand landed on it before Layla\u2019s like a hawk\u2019s shadow before a jump. She did not whisk it away; she placed it in the exact center of the table with the patience of a teacher waiting for a child to decide whether he would choose honesty. The crowd felt the mood pivot the way a herd does when a rustle turns into a line in the grass. Basim sidled closer as if he had been propelled by a coincidence. Hessa set the lemon knife down and folded her hands, which was a sign to anyone who knew her that someone was about to be politely flayed.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d Layla said, the syllable the length of a single breath because she was a woman who had learned that brevity is a weapon you can use without blood. \u201cA gift.\u201d She did not open it privately because that had never been her sport. She asked for the Auntie with the sternest eyebrows to do the honor, which is a way to show a room who you believe has the right to be disappointed in you. The envelope had been sealed with an adhesive designed to be respectable and failed because it had been made by men who did not know the weather here. It peeled. Inside lay cash that tried to look like backup plans and a small card with a logo that had worn three names in two years. The card read, in the tone of a polite insult, For refreshments. The cash lay on the table like a confession from a child who did not yet know how to avoid adjectives. Layla looked at the audience, at the vendor table where men had suddenly remembered their shoes, at the ceiling of shade cloth that did not know it was witnessing joy yearn not to be injured by stupidity.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said in Arabic so clean even men who preferred English could find their way through it. \u201cWe do need refreshments. Our staff drinks water. Our volunteers eat dates. Our vendors are welcome to tea.\u201d She handed the envelope to Hessa, who decanted the cash into a clear jar with a theatrically labeled slot: Cash gifts for the flooring fund\u2014thank you for your contribution to our very boring and very necessary maintenance. The room laughed from their bellies because it felt good to watch a trick be made foolish in front of them. The vendor who had offered the envelope shifted and then straightened as if someone had put a spine in his shirt. He would survive, which was the desired outcome; people rarely change if you turn them into villains before giving them a chance.\n\nThe day almost made it through on the momentum of its honesty before the sabotage remembered its calendar. At half past three, when the heat had agreed to become merely parental instead of punitive, the generators feeding the vendor booths took a hiccup that was not the water-saving kind. The lights under the shade cloths stuttered; a projector trying to show a compost timeline decided to resurrect its screensaver of a beach that had never met a cigarette butt. Tariq\u2019s sensors chirped in that modest way good equipment has when it would like to inform you that your afternoon is about to change. He did not run, because running turns an irritation into a spectacle. He adjusted a plug in public and replaced a cable in private and followed the hiss of interference to a silver briefcase with the heft of false importance tucked under a chair near the tea. The briefcase was not bomb-smooth; it was a nest for a battery pack that had been told to misbehave at three-thirty and had done so with obedience that made Tariq scowl for its lack of imagination.\n\nSaffiyah, seeing the flicker in the light and the shift in the crowd\u2019s shoulders toward impatience, climbed on a chair and, with the ease of a woman who has been performing since she was twelve in living rooms with unkind lamps, announced a spontaneous contest to see which child could sort the contents of a mystery bin fastest with one hand tied to a friend\u2019s. It is hard to notice the temperature of the room when small people are cheering for banana peels to find their way home. The briefcase\u2019s battery sulked itself into useful again when Tariq showed it a picture of itself three minutes ago that he would later admit he had faked out of a petty joy at tricking something smug. The lights steadied. A girl in glitter sneakers beat three boys in a row while an old man from Diriyah took bets and made a killing in almonds. The moment that might have turned into muttering became a story, and stories stick when muttering does not.\n\nThe slickest lie of the day came wrapped in sincerity and a white polo shirt. A foundation no one in the room had heard of before this morning rolled in a cube on casters that wanted too much to be admired. It presented itself as a \u201chome micro-digester,\u201d a polite, sealed box that promised to eat food scraps without complaint and deliver liquid gold to your plants which would then thank you by growing obediently. Its spokeswomen had the earnest faces of people who believe a press release can make rain. They plugged the cube in and cooed at it and let it hum. Layla bent, not to smell the hum but to look underneath where people who design lies often forget to decorate. The drain line was capped and immaculate. The hum was manufactured. The cube did not have the weight of something that had eaten anything ever.\n\n\u201cMay I feed it something rude?\u201d Layla asked, smiling with every tooth. She took a handful of old bread that had been saved for this exact sacrament and broke it into the cube\u2019s mouth. The cube purred like a cat who wants peace and not accountability. She asked an Auntie to pour a cup of dishwater into the cube because she was feeling cruel. The spokeswomen\u2019s smiles trembled in the way of women who have been told by men that they can sell this anywhere because the world is full of distracted people. The dishwater pooled quietly under the cube without even having the decency to run with drama. The Aunties watched the pool expand as if admiring a henna pattern. The salvage Uncle chuckled in a way that made the sound carry farther than shouting would have. The spokeswomen attempted to unplug their miracle. Layla placed her foot gently on the cord.\n\n\u201cLeave it,\u201d she said, kindness wrapping the words because kindness is also a blade. \u201cWe will fix it for you. We will send you our notes. We will not buy it. But please come back when it can actually eat, and the women here will give you advice you cannot buy with any envelope.\u201d\n\nBy the time the shade had climbed the far wall and given mercy to the men who had been pretending they did not need it, the Bazaar had done the work Layla had asked of it. Children wore ribbons for being \u201chard to fool,\u201d a badge that sat on their chests with more pride than some diplomas; aunties compared notes on stickers as if on recipes; men with actual contracts to offer had mouthed thank you to Layla and meant it because the room had given them a way to say no to nonsense without making enemies at a cousin\u2019s dinner. A bell hung on three booths and a fourth in a man\u2019s hand because he had decided to spend his next free Friday at the salvage yard practicing apologies disguised as ingenuity.\n\nIn the soft mess after the crowd unbraided into roads and kitchens and air-conditioned indignations, Layla sat on the edge of a table and let her feet dangle like a girl who had brought a good report card home to a family that would clap and then ask what she learned, not what she scored. Yara came to lean one hip against the table, her clipboard now heavy with names that would find themselves either paid or waved at. Basim appeared with a print of a photograph he knew she would keep: a girl with her face set like a key turned at the correct angle, holding a stopwatch with both hands, her eyes on an aunt who was pouring exactly too fast on purpose.\n\n\u201cYou did not make it theater,\u201d Basim said, sounding almost disappointed and being secretly relieved. \u201cYou made it kitchen. With borrowed chairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cKitchen is where the city makes itself,\u201d Layla said, taking the photo and sliding it under the bell on her shawl to hold it down. \u201cTheater is where we convince ourselves we are already done.\u201d\n\nThey did not get to sit for long. Tariq\u2019s quiet machine ticked. The loop shivered, a dog shaking water from its coat. The hawk had tried another tug at the suppression system and found itself wrestling with a memory, grew annoyed and reckless, and pinged an IP that did not belong to its original room. Through the crack of that annoyance, in slipped the shape of a hub whose address had been a question since the first ding in the graph. Tariq held it like a fish you cradle in water to keep it breathing while you decide whether you will eat it. The packet came from Unit Q3 not at the Avaloran suite but from a floor below a coworking space where men with laptops and fragile opinions rented desk hours by the hour and called this stability. It ran through a private exchange that belonged to a man on Layla\u2019s list, one who had accepted soup and signed the sentence about supervisor signatures with a neatness that had made Yara suspicious.\n\n\u201cWe expected a pantry,\u201d Yara said, tapping the map Tariq had blossomed on her screen. \u201cWe have a broom closet instead. It is close. It is domestic. It believes itself overlooked.\u201d\n\n\u201cTonight?\u201d Tariq asked, a little too fast because he had smelled a door and doors are his favorite drug. \u201cTonight, we tuck it into bed and make it talk to us while it dreams.\u201d\n\n\u201cTonight we let it believe the house is empty,\u201d Layla said, feeling the tug-of-war between impatience and discipline draw old lines in her shoulders. \u201cWe will visit at fajr, when the city is better-mannered and the men who sleep poorly have gone home to pretend they have slept at all. Bring a screwdriver that believes in persuasion. Bring nothing else you cannot throw into a potted plant if someone surprises you.\u201d\n\nOn the way to the car, a man in a white polo shirt with a logo that had been designed to resemble nothing and therefore look expensive stepped into Layla\u2019s path with the respectful belligerence of a person who believes women owe him their time because he has learned how to shave without cutting himself. He introduced himself as the director of a foundation dedicated to \u201cdisruption in household practices.\u201d He used the word disruption like a toothpick. He said he had been extremely impressed by the Bazaar and wished to fund the next one with the understanding that \u201ccertain vendors\u201d would be \u201cplaced in highly visible positions\u201d on the field. He said the word field as if he were describing a polo match.\n\n\u201cYou may fund the bathrooms,\u201d Layla said, smiling with sufficient warmth to keep it civil. \u201cThey need good lights and better drains. If you write me a check for both, your logo can appear near the sink with a sentence that says you understand the difference between hygiene and disruption. If you prefer something that photographs better, we are not the people you should marry.\u201d\n\nThe man blinked twice like a lizard adjusting. He said he would \u201ccircle back.\u201d She said she would be exactly where he found her now\u2014annoying and asked for too much and not going away.\n\nAt home the house had scrapes on its shins from a day of being useful. Hessa set tea on the table with the sigh people make when their body is tired and their mind will not be for another hour. Saffiyah told a story about a child who had taken the confetti from the smart label and made it into a wedding for a beetle under a chair, and Layla laughed until she had to wipe her eyes with the hem of her own sleeve like a person without servants. Yara laid out the map of the building with the broom closet and used salt grains to mark the cameras that lied to themselves and lentil husks to mark the door that stuck every time a man heavier than his job tried to go through it. Tariq cupped his hands around his tea as if it were an ear.\n\nBasim sent a photograph without words: Mireille at a balcony that had not learned modesty, holding a wineglass that was the wrong color for the outfit and therefore the only honest thing about the picture. The caption posted by someone else beneath it read, in French that tried too hard not to be rude, that Avalora\u2019s Princess admired the bravery of Saudi\u2019s \u201csustainability spectacle.\u201d Layla did not reply to Basim because there was nothing to say that would be new. She forwarded the picture to no one and asked God for the gift of not minding metaphors when your hands are covered in the glue of logistics.\n\nThey slept a blessed hour like soldiers in a house at peace, shoes near, hair braided. At the call to fajr, the city opened its eyes and yawned tenderness into its streets. They moved like reflections down the quiet corridors of the coworking building where chairs dreamed of posture and chargers coiled like small serpents around desk legs. The broom closet door wore two locks for show and one for loyalty. Yara handled the show; Layla whispered to the loyalty with her hairpin until it agreed to let them be the exception that proves nothing.\n\nInside, the closet was less tidy than the data would have liked to pretend. A slim case hummed to itself, the hawk\u2019s old arrogance scratched by a hand that did not like being careful. Taped to the wall, a paper like the one Yara had pulled from the driver\u2019s van bore the hand-scrawled note in English, because men always love to be international when misbehaving: Q3 mirror. Do not disconnect unless told by G. The letter G had been written with pressure that put the tip of the pen through the paper because softness is not a talent men who like being obeyed practice.\n\n\u201cGhassan?\u201d Tariq asked, scandalized not by the possibility but by the initial\u2019s lack of creativity.\n\n\u201cGhassan,\u201d Layla said, not relieved, not shocked, the mild sadness of discovering that someone you had applauded for admitting tiredness had decided to take a nap on a line you had told him not to cross. \u201cOr the man who wants me to think Ghassan. Or the God you believe you are when you reinvent routing tables without supervision. It doesn\u2019t matter for this room. We will make it honest.\u201d\n\nThey did not unplug the box. Tariq sat cross-legged on the floor and pulled from his bag a device that looked humble\u2014a lunchbox, a recurrence of kitchen\u2014opened it, and revealed the small polite teeth of a tap. He installed it upstream of the hawk\u2019s mouth and gave it a memory as gentle and persistent as an aunt\u2019s voice, a thing that says, over and over, we see you, we hear you, we are writing the minutes of this meeting. Yara resecured the door with a small wedge under the hinge that would tell her, by the posture of the floor\u2019s squeak, if someone had opened it after they left. Layla looked for a pen and wrote on the paper under G\u2019s demand a sentence in her grandmother\u2019s careful script: Please call your mother.\n\nOn the way out, at the stairwell, a man in an ill-considered suit leaned against the railing with the posture of someone who has stayed too long at a party where nobody knows his favorite song. He had the bruise a tailor cannot cover without insult and the eyes of a person who has misunderstood who the enemy is. He said, in English because he had learned to be brave in that language, that Layla should stop embarrassing men who \u201cmean well.\u201d She said, in Arabic because that is how you scold with intimacy, that men who mean well and then choose ease over decency are the river that wears away a city more surely than any drought. He moved his mouth as if he might say her name like a weapon. Yara stepped slightly to the right and the man remembered his teeth and how much better they felt when inside his own mouth.\n\nBy eight, the city was stirring itself into traffic and office chairs. By nine, the Pavilion\u2019s fountains performed their quiet show for a class of children whose teacher had asked them in the bus to think of three ways to be boring heroes at home. By ten, a video of Layla opening an envelope in public and putting cash into a clear jar had been sliced by men in a building with a logo that resembled a cloud into something that suggested she was accepting bribes and grinning. By ten-fifteen, Basim had posted the entire eight minutes in which the Aunties rolled their eyes in unison, which is a diplomat\u2019s nightmare because no government wants to be on the other side of Auntie eyes, and the cut lost its sharpness like sugar left out all night. By noon, Ghassan texted a single word that could be a confession or a plea: Talk.\n\nIn the afternoon, while the air made a pilgrimage back to the ground and Layla let herself sit for the space of a tea\u2019s cool-down, a boy from the clinic arrived with a drawing. It was of a tank on a roof with a monster inside, tongue out, being poked by a lady with a hairpin. The lady looked twice as tall as the tank and had a bell on her scarf. Underneath he had written in square letters his teacher would refuse to correct: Thank you for the trick. She pinned it to the wall above her desk with the falcon bell, where the ring would remind her to laugh at least once even when the next trick arrived with a bow and a name she could not yet say out loud.\n\nToward evening, Riyadh put its shoulder under the day one last time and pushed. A message came from M that said, in a tone that knew how to be a compliment without sincerity eroding it, that the Bazaar had been a lesson. \u201cYou are better on rugs than carpets,\u201d it read. \u201cI have made a note. Return the bell if you ever tire of the sound it makes.\u201d Layla considered crafting an elegant reply and instead sent back a photograph of a boy holding a stopwatch and a woman cutting lemons, a vocabulary M would understand even if she had never learned to speak it. Then she turned her phone facedown and went to the roof with a bowl of pistachios because you must feed victory and worry the same snacks or else they become jealous.\n\n\u201cTomorrow we make the bathroom lights better,\u201d she said, when Yara joined her with the kind of quiet that makes a body believe it has a second wind in it somewhere. \u201cIt is not glorious, which is why we will be good at it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow we call mothers,\u201d Yara said, which seemed, as always, both solution and metaphor. \u201cAnd we ring bells, not to shame, but to remind.\u201d\n\n\u201cShame is useful only when it retires quickly,\u201d Layla said, cracking a pistachio with the ease of someone born with patient fingers. The city breathed. The bell above her desk winked from its new perch in the window. Somewhere, in a broom closet with a note that had not expected a reply, a little device told the truth to a recorder and did not know it was doing something holy. Somewhere, in a room with the wrong color of wine, a woman in white crossed out a line on a list and wrote another with a pen that had been sharpened to an unkind point. Somewhere in between, which is where all the interesting work happens, men texted cousins they had decided to disappoint and women laid out rugs for a gathering next week where they would bring lemons and knives and make a kitchen out of another room that had forgotten that was what it was for.",
