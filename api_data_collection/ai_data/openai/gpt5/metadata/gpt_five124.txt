He came home in the quiet way that only famous people attempt, a slow re-entry with the cap pulled down and the sunglasses at night that made strangers want to stare. Cheltenham was not Los Angeles and thanked him for it by being unhurried when he needed unhurried. The terraces were white and orderly, swans across the parks, and the air smelt like rain was always thinking about it even when the sky was a plain blue sheet. He carried his luggage himself up the steps of the townhouse on Imperial Square and his heart felt like the suitcase was inside it, clacking against bone.

Sherwood had a movie star's name because he had needed one. The boy he used to be was called Conrad Lake, plain enough to be a pond in a farmer's field. It had looked lifeless on the first script he was ever given. The casting assistant had said, try something with edges, love. So he chose a forest and the man from history who stole to give away, and everyone seemed to nod and it stuck. Sherwood Lake, he would hear them say into phones. Like the place. Like a boy by a river. Not real, and yet.

The keys bit into his palm and then turned, a whisper of luck. The townhouse had a ghost of someone else, the faint smell of polish and lavender, a pair of cobwebs that had been forgotten on purpose. He walked through rooms that had been photographed for the letting agent and not much touched since. A brown leather sofa that hissed when you sat. Fireplaces blocked and painted. French windows that led to a square of garden with a little iron fence like a polite boundary that would never be crossed. The garden beyond was not his, a communal bit of green that felt like he had been allowed to look at someone else's childhood.

He heard next door before he saw her. It was afternoon music but soft, a piano not practicing scales but finding a song by ear. A neat right hand, a left that kept losing it and then catching, and the phrase that came back was something old he couldn't name. He put his cheek to the cool of his own wall and smiled and it probably looked foolish. He was newly returned and the town hugged and kept distance in equal measure. That was the thing about being known here. They had all watched the boy go off to London, then America, taking the train out of Cheltenham Spa with a rucksack and a smile that his father had said was borrowed. So when he came back they nodded and maybe said his mum's name, June, if they had known her enough to watch him leave.

He unpacked badly and left a trail of shirts like a breadcrumb track. He phoned Owen and got voicemail. Owen Lock, manager and friend by abnormal default, would say something later about how it was good, being home, and then start talking about the next set of contract negotiations as if they were wallpaper choices. Saskia Reed, the agent who never slept, texted five times a list that began with Are you safe and ended with Avoid the racecourse, paps will think it is a hobby of yours. He dragged himself into the shower and let water hit his eyelids until he saw false stars.

The knock came after the piano had moved on to nothing at all. Three quiet taps, like someone unsure of the wall between them and the street. He wrapped the towel in a way he had learned abroad because his old way had failed him in hotel rooms when doors had opened suddenly. He put on a T-shirt with a tourist's pun on it. The knock came again, gentler. He breathed in the kind of breath you only take when you are about to introduce yourself to your own life.

He opened the door and she was there with a sheet of paper. Her hair was the color of diluted walnut stain and tied back with an elastic band that had broken once and been tied again. She was older than he'd guessed from the lightness of her piano, which was not to say old, just set in a way people get when they have had a reason to be stubborn. She wore an apron that said Atkinson's Coffee on it and one of those hoodies that gets a grease mark at the pocket corner. The paper in her hand was an open envelope and it said Mr. Lake on the front even though he had not told the letting agent he was using his old name. It had been pushed through her door by mistake and she had done the neighbourly thing.

"Hi," he said, which was too small a word.

"Hi," she said, and her accent was local but with the edges ironed. "You have my letter, I have yours. Or the other way around. I'm Mara." She held out the paper and hesitated like the handoff was a fragile thing that might break wrong.

He took it and wanted to say her name back. "Sherwood," he said instead, because he could not explain why Conrad was in a shed somewhere in his head, covered in dust and spiderwebs. "Thank you."

"People think I'm lost in the evenings," Mara said, glancing past him to the staircase that smelt faintly of carpet cleaner. "I suppose because of the apron. But I'm not. I live next door. The piano's mine. I'm sorry if it gets through. The walls aren't... they're a suggestion. Like rules."

"It's beautiful," he said quickly, and watched his words make a shape in the little hallway and then flop, embarrassed. "I mean, the music. The piano. I'm not complaining."

She looked like she wanted to take the compliment and put it somewhere safe, but she settled for a small nod. "Thank you. I work stupid hours sometimes. And I keep thinking, I will get better at it if I go slow enough, but then someone shoves the day forward anyway." Her eyes flicked to his T-shirt and she smirked. "Nice shirt."

"They gave it to me free when I bought coffee in San Diego," he said, suddenly less careful. "It was the only clean one at the top of the bag. I'm not being cool."

"You're doing fine," she said. "Welcome back."

The words hit him harder than the water had. Welcome back is what people said to footballers after a loan period, or to someone whose house had been rebuilt after a storm. He did not know what to say, so he said the same back.

He watched her go down the steps and walk across to her own door. She had a way of walking that was both cautious and practiced, like she had learned to move around people a long time ago and had kept the habit even when she was alone. When she looked up to put the key in, their eyes caught, and he wondered if he was reflected in hers with too much brightness. She went inside. The piano did not start again, but he could imagine the chord in her hands.

He spent the first night half-asleep and half-remembering the desert. The last shoot had been in New Mexico, not far from a roadside motel where he had once shared orange juice with a man who had a tattoo of a phoenix charred into him. The desert had done its usual thing, turned him into a mirage. A lizard had stolen his lunch. The director had shouted at the sky in case it chose to listen. He dreamt he was back there, lying down with his ear to the sand, and the distant tremor he heard was an English kettle starting to boil. In the morning, he woke to the sound of bins being pulled along the pavement and the piano playing two notes, then stopping.

He went out into Cheltenham as if he were a tourist in his own childhood. The Promenade wore its trees like it always had. Ladies walked dogs that should have been ridiculous and somehow were not. He bought a flask from a camping shop because buying anything at all anchored him. He sat in a cafe near the Rotunda and the waitress decided to take pity on him and pretended not to know who he was. The kindness of ignoring is greater, he thought, than the kindness of fuss. The boy at the counter, however, could not help himself. He had the face of a boy who had seen his mother cry at some film and remembered it.

"Are you him," the boy whispered when he brought over the coffee, and then his courage failed halfway between him and the table.

"I'm him," Sherwood said. No one heard; or if they did, they looked away and let it be. The boy helped him with the sugar like this was a ritual in which both believed. "Thank you."

"You're shorter," the boy said, and then blushed so fast it was like a trick of lighting. "Sorry."

"That's all right," Sherwood said. "They put a box under me for the big scenes. It is a cinematic secret. Don't tell."

The boy smiled with a relief that made Sherwood ache. He sipped his coffee. It was bitter in a way that made him think he could stay awake for an entire week if he wanted. He did not want.

When he walked back to Imperial Square, Mara was sitting on the steps with her apron in a ball. There was a plastic bag at her feet with carrots poking their orange noses out as if the shop had been a garden. She looked up at him and Abby, from number 14, who was smoking two houses down with a little dog on her lap, called, "Morning, Sherwood," as if they had known each other since nursery. He nodded at Abby, who had a face like a daisy that had been left out overnight. The dog made a sound like an accordion playing one left-behind note.

"I didn't realise your name was actually Sherwood," Mara said when he got close. "I thought it might be a ... you know."

"It is," he said. "Really. It started as something else, but it stuck. And now my mother says it easier because she gets to smile halfway through the word."

"June Lake," Mara said, and then bit her lip. "Sorry. That was nosy. People say a lot in this town without meaning to say it."

"She keeps bees now," he said. "It makes the neighbours love her more than they already did. Bangor villas at the edge of the map. The bees make the place look useful."

Mara looked like she was filing that away under soft things to think about later. "I make coffee and bind books," she said. "The coffee is for money. The books are for the same thing, but in a different tone of voice."

"Bind books," he said. He sat beside her on the step because that was a thing you could do in Cheltenham without anyone thinking you were making a speech about class. "Like... binding?"

"Like stitching the spine back into dignity when someone flung it into a bag," she said. "I like to think hands can make a sort of amends for what hands do."

"Hands do good things too," he offered, and she raised her eyebrows as if the case was not yet closed, but she let the point be. The carrots looked at the sky as if waiting for a verdict.

"Well," she said, after a pause that felt like a decision. "If you need spare sugar or a ladder, I'm next door with a piano that thinks it's a friend."

"Do you have any matches," he said without thinking, a stupid question from an actor who had spent too long lighting fake cigarettes on sets where no one trusted any element to be real. He flushed. "For candles. I brought my own curtains. The house is cold in the evening. The radiator made a sound like an insult, so I turned it off in case it was actually speaking."

"I have matches," she said. "I get them from the same man who cuts the keys. He likes to add in something flammable with the metal. Says it keeps fate even."

She stood, brushed her hands on her jeans, and went inside, returning with a little box that had a print of a horse on it that looked like it had lost half its legs in the cheap printing process. She handed it to him. Their fingers touched in the exchange. It was not a shock, not the thing movies pretend it is, but a warm notice, a small radio turned up in a quiet room.

That night he lit a candle and watched the match flare and waste. The candle was nothing special, supermarket lemon, bought because someone had recommended citrus on a plane once. But the little light moved around the surfaces and made the room look like it was listening. He thought of fire as a kind of rehearsal for light. He thought of burning. Not to do, but the word itself. It stuck in his throat like a stone you might try to swallow when you were a child to see what bravery tasted like. He blew out the match and pinched the wick between finger and wet.

Days started working around him. He went running in Pittville Park when no one sane would and shared the frost with teenagers who wanted to teach their lungs how to suffer. He brought a notebook into the Holloway House cafe and pretended he was a writer until someone came over and asked if he would sign their toilet pass. He would. He signed whatever anyone brought that had space. He signed a plaster cast once, and a dog bandana because the dog had looked like it very much cared what kind of signature it wore.

Mara moved around him like a companion comet. They were not together, that would have implied a tether, a word like laced. Instead they had a corridor between their doors and they shared things in the corridor without speaking about the rules. A jar of honey from his mother that she slid onto his mat with a Post-it note that said, Bees say hi. A cup of flour he returned, over-generous by a scoop, as if to put weight to gratitude. They talked in small cut pieces, at odd times, when the Englishness of the weather seemed to ask them to.

He learned she had grown up in Gloucester, that she had moved to Cheltenham because it was the distance of a song on the bus from her father and just far enough to pretend it was a different country. He learned she had an older brother who had left and never come back, and you could feel the missing even in her casual talk, like a chair that had been removed from a room but still left a shadow on the carpet. She learned he hated champagne but drank it when he had to because somewhere a camera would be figuring out how to make it look like he enjoyed it. They did not tell each other everything. They told just enough to leave room for the rest.

One evening, they took their tea to the square. Winter was a slow room with the door half open. The iron fence looked like it might say something if you asked. A man with a shopping trolley wheeled his own life past them, a duvet rolled up like a large white pastry, a radio held together with tape. He had a face that made you think of stories. He nodded to them with the dignity of a judge deigning to acknowledge the court.

"That's Mr. Foyle," Abby said from somewhere behind them, doing the thing of arriving and assuming she had been invited by the air. "He feeds the squirrels. Used to be in the army. Now he's in the park. Don't park where he likes to sit, though. He can get fierce about edges."

Mara lifted her cup and drank. "Everyone claims a place," she murmured. "Even the pigeons get the rooflines."

Mr. Foyle turned his radio up and the sound of someone talking about football drifted across the grass like smoke. Sherwood wanted to tell him he respected his boundaries, and he wanted to ask him too many questions, and he did neither thing. Later, the light folded and unfolded in the windows of their houses like a trick.

"Would you ever leave again," Mara asked, not looking at him.

"Yes," he said, because he had learned not to act a lie at home. "Because the work is there and they make it in stupid places, or I do. But I came back first. It mattered."

"You're so careful with answers," she said, and smiled without showing teeth, the kind of smile that friends give each other when they want to say I see you without making you stand on a chair. "One day you should say something careless. It might be the best thing you ever say."

He looked at her. For a second the word love made itself into a paper shape in his head, one of those cranes that people in films fold when they think no one is watching, and the crane hovered above his tongue. He said nothing, because when he tried to reach for it, the word flew up to the ceiling and hung there upside down like a bat.

The days were ordinary, and so, like all ordinary days in stories, they had the peril of being close to not-ordinary without anyone warning. Sherwood had a meeting in London and took the early train. He watched fields go past that believed in themselves. Mara had a shift that ended late and began again too early because someone had called in sick. They left each other notes even when there was nothing to say. Bucket in the hallway leaks, sorry for the slosh. Left a lemon cake on your mat, apparently my hands were sugar today. In the mornings, the piano sounded braver.

On a Thursday that was trying not to be anything, they stood in the kitchen of his house and made spaghetti like people do when they want to eat and talk and have their hands occupied so the talking doesn't look so large. He had bought a plant and it wilted theatrically in the corner.

"You need to talk to it," Mara said, tasting the sauce with the concentration of someone diagnosing a melody. "Plants die of being ignored."

"I am talking to it," he said. "I'm saying, look at all this expensive soil I gave you. I'm saying, don't embarrass me in front of a woman who plays Schubert with a face like a prayer."

She laughed at that, a low sound that made the room change shape. "It's not Schubert," she said. "It's a tune my nan used to hum when she mended our coats. It probably started as something by someone with a name, but by the time it got to me it was hers."

They ate at the little table near the window and watched the lights of the cars go by on the road like slow comets. "I do want," he said then, watching his fork because people tell bigger truths to their cutlery, "to not be seen all the time. It's a stupid thing to complain about, I know. People would kill for it. Yet..."

"It's not stupid," Mara said. "You are watched and then you are watched some more, and it becomes curiosity and then it becomes appetite. Pity the touched thing. I used to think all attention is love, before I had to take a bus in a certain skirt and learn otherwise."

"Who didn't love you that you wanted to," he asked, and regretted it immediately, because that was an ambush question, he had set the tripwire himself.

She put her fork down and wiped the edge of her mouth with the corner of a napkin. "A man with a kind voice and a car that was too low to the ground to make sense to my dad," she said. "His kindness had a lot of doors that closed behind you."

He didn't know what to say, so he said something small. "A lot of doors," he murmured, and watched her nod as if she understood that he meant, I am listening.

After she left that night, he walked the house like the ghost of himself. He lit the stupid lemon candle and thought about the man with the kind voice. Mara's head had been bowed when she spoke. He wanted, fiercely and suddenly, to build a small fire on a beach somewhere and feed it every door that had ever been used meanly. He went to bed on that anger like it could keep him warm.

In the morning, he woke to his phone doing that shake of a thing that meant news had decided to be in his pocket. Owen had texted, You went out last night? There's a picture of you buying soap that looks like you bought a city. Saskia sent him a link anyway. He clicked and saw himself looking like a nice ghost. He was holding a brown paper bag as if it contained his dignity and a candle. The caption was something like Sherwood Lake, The Badboy Who Learned To Shop, which was a sentence no one should ever have to read.

He went out into the square to get air, or to be taken by it. Mr. Foyle was there already, feeding squirrels bread they should not eat, speaking to them like they owed him rent. Abby had her hair in a scarf and the dog in a jumper. The morning had parked its clouds at a tilt. Mara came out holding a plastic tub. She lifted it at him like a salute. Here, they did not need to speak to be friendly. That was for later.

In the corner of his eye, he saw the elderly man who did crossword puzzles near the gate. The one who wore his flat cap at the angle of someone who trusts gravity to do half the work. Sherwood had never known his name, which was a failure of his he had been meaning to repair. The man had a shopping bag with the council's crest on it and a gait that had learned to argue with knees. He crossed the road towards the little bakery that sold cinnamon buns the size of regret.

"That's Mr. Banham," Abby said, because she knew everything that had names. "Mr. Banham of the post office once upon a time. He'll outlive us all just to spite the chippy queue."

Sherwood watched him go, slow and stubborn. He noticed, because he noticed small wrongnesses for a living, that a delivery van had stopped partly on the pavement across the way and was making the curb look like an invitation to wobble. He thought, then, of going over and asking them to move, of playing the citizen. He thought of it and then watched the thought drift away like a balloon. I will get him a bun one day, he thought, and then he thought, Stop narrating your own life, you idiot.

The afternoon gathered itself. A scatter of rain, and then not. He went to see his mother and let the bees change the subject whenever he grew too serious. June Lake had a laugh that grew things. She made him toast in the kitchen of the semi with the rosebush that had outlived two generations of cats, and she told him, as if talking about a neighbour's dog, that he should sleep more. He kissed her cheek. He drove back carefully through the lanes with names like fairytales shaved bald by the local council. He parked like a man trying to be better than he had been yesterday.

Mara was not home. He stood in the hall and listened to the absence of the piano. He tried to tell himself he was not waiting and failed at it like failing an exam he had never revised for. He went out again because not-waiting is sometimes impossible inside a house. The streetlights flickered on like someone decided to lie on purpose.

He turned the corner and nearly collided with her. Mara's hair was down and the elastic band was a casualty on her wrist. Her face had the perfectly ordinary tiredness of someone who has done a day and still has another night's worth in her pocket. She smiled when she saw him, the slow smile without teeth again, a thing that felt private even on the public pavement.

"There you are," she said softly, as if he were a thing she had been looking for and had found under a cushion. "I was going to drop off soup because your eyes always look hollow after you see your mother. I don't mean that rude. Mothers are hollowing and replenishing at the same time."

"Bees," he said, and she nodded as if bees were a sentence.

They stood like that, the two of them, neither quite willing to say do you want to come in or shall we, as if the question would be too much, like setting off a small alarm in the night that would wake the pigeons. A car came down the road. It was the kind of car no one noticed. It had a bumper with a crack near the number plate and a blue air freshener hanging like a bad charm. The headlights were not generous. Sherwood could not, years later, swear to its make when he gave a statement.

It was the sort of evening where the light is greased, where the wet on the roads from an earlier, petty rain becomes important. The car slowed at the corner where the bakery turned into the square. It was one of those almost-stops that people do when there are no cameras, a bit of a halt, a bit of an ignore. Sherwood saw Mr. Banham step from the kerb and at the same time saw the van from earlier still there, half-obedient to the paving stones. He did not connect the things until much later, when he would examine them like evidence that could be soothed into being less than they were.

Mara looked past him. Her head tilted, a small, birdlike move. He heard her take a breath that was too shallow to be ordinary. He looked where she was looking because he had learned that in scenes, you point your eyes and the audience follows, and real life sometimes complied with the rules of blocking. The car kept moving. Mr. Banham, stubborn and a tiny bit careless with his body in the way the very old can be, stepped fully into the road, trusting the day to catch him.

Sherwood saw, in a flicker that seemed to elongate like a piece of gum pulled slow between fingers, Mara take one step forward, a useless step, an instinct. He reached his hand in the space in front of her without touching her, as if his palm could make a net out of air. The sound the car's tyre made on the wet was like a slowed-down match being struck. The world tilted. Somewhere, a radio in someone's pocket laughed. And then everything that was ordinary became something else, the kind of moment that sits down in a life and refuses to move, a moment when tyres and decisions and an old man with shopping intersected.

He would remember later what he did not say. He would remember the lemon smell of the candle that had seeped into his jumper. He would remember Mara's hand opening and closing around nothing, as if trying to catch a thought before it fell. He would remember the small and stupid details, like the crack in the car's bumper looking like a smile that had been damaged on purpose. He would remember wanting to set something alight, as if flames could rescue on the spot what time would not give back. But right then there was only one sound rising, a sound not yet born, and the street held its breath as if sound were a verdict and silence a reprieve.Chapter 2

The sound arrived like a door slammed in the next room of the world. It wasn’t the big metallic roar of cinema, not the symphonic catastrophe where glass becomes rain and rain becomes violin. It was a thud oddly domestic, something soft striking something unforgiving, a noise you could mishear as a dropped parcel if your mind was trying to be kind. The car stopped too late, its front dipped in the little curtsey machines make when they are sorry, and Mr. Banham went down in a way that suggested parts of him had decided different directions were sensible. There was a moment after when no one let the air out of their lungs, and then the air let itself out of its own accord, because that is what air does when asked to hold.

Sherwood moved without the version of himself that asked for permission from his image. He had never been trained for anything more practical than pretending to be someone who knew what to do, and yet his body tried to manufacture competence out of childhood first aid and American sets with safety briefings that lasted longer than marriages. He reached the road and did not touch the old man. He remembered that much. Do not move him. Do not move him unless he is under fire or water or worse than both. He crouched, knees stinging from the wet grit, and saw Mr. Banham’s eyes open like coins someone had polished and then remembered they weren’t worth much. The bag with the council crest had spilled a loaf, a newspaper, a small tin of soup that rolled and then stopped as if watching.

Mara was already there. She moved in a way that said she had moved decisively before, in kitchens with boiling sugar or doorways that needed a body to stop them from shutting. She put her hand near Mr. Banham’s shoulder and then withdrew it, fingers curling into a fist small enough to be bitten by her own palm. “Don’t move him,” she said, and then, to herself, as if reading a list of instructions out loud, “Don’t move him, keep him warm, talk to him.” She turned her head and shouted with unexpected force, “Abby, scarf. Foyle, duvet,” and it turned out the world had been practicing for this call-out because Abby was already unwinding the scarf from her hair and Mr. Foyle was squaring his shoulders at the same time as he shouldered the duvet off his trolley, and the dog on Abby’s lap barked one confused bark like someone who had arrived late to a joke.

The driver of the car sat still at first, hands on the wheel as if it were a ceremony he had not read the rite for. He was young in a way that looks older on a bad day, jaw bristled in the manner of a man-boy trying to grow time on his face. He stared straight ahead for a count of three, and then looked down at his own knees as if expecting blood. He opened his door. “I didn’t—” he began, but the sentence fell out of his mouth as if it had been badly balanced on his tongue. “I looked. I stopped. I—I stopped.”

“It’s wet,” said Mr. Foyle in a voice that had met bullets in a previous life and found all other explanations short of boring. He crouched with more grace than men forty years his junior and draped the duvet over the fallen man, tucking it like a mother putting a blanket round a child who has learned to pretend he doesn’t need it. “What’s your name, Captain?”

“Banham,” Mara said before the man could answer, and then she caught herself and asked, “What’s your first name, sir? I’m sorry. I’m Mara. I’m next door to all your bus stops.”

“Arthur,” he said, and his voice was not frightened so much as affronted, the kind of tone in which a man protests a change in the price of milk. “Bloody—excuse my—pavement’s gone slippy. They drop soap on it now.”

Sherwood heard himself laugh and then hated himself for laughing and loved himself for it too, because Mr. Banham’s mouth twitched in approval. He reached out his hand and put it near the old man’s, not touching, just occupying the space where a touch would be if someone asked for it. “My name is Sherwood,” he said, because names were something you could throw down like planks between people when there was a gap. “You’re doing very well at being difficult.”

“Been doing it eighty-seven years,” Arthur said. “You’re the cinema boy.”

“I am,” Sherwood said. “We’re all going to pretend I have a medical degree now.” He looked up. Abby was on her phone, words spilling in efficient increments: Imperial Square, old man down, conscious, breathing, possible leg, not moving, driver on scene, no, not bleeding badly, yes he’s talking, yes, yes, yes. When she named the street, her voice slowed on Imperial like it had a memory of coronations that had never happened here.

Mara’s hand hovered again and then found a corner of the duvet and tucked it under Arthur’s shoulder with the tenderness of someone putting away summer clothes. Her other hand reached out and pushed the spilled newspaper under the old man’s head, not for cushioning—it was too thin for that—but for the dignity of not lying directly on the road. The newspaper had a headline about a parliament figure who had been seen where he swore he hadn’t. The ink stained a patch on the duvet in a way that would survive in someone’s memory long after the news had not.

The van that had been partly on the pavement still sat like a badly parked thought. Its driver, a man with a belly of other people’s packages and a face of a father who borrowed sleep, peered out from his cab with his hands gripping the wheel in a mirror of the young man’s. He did not get out. He looked like he wanted to step into the scene and reverse it, and he looked like he knew he was part of it anyway, and he did neither, his indecision a small, private sin at a large, public altar.

Sirens were the next sound, arriving not as a noise but as a promise of noise, a thread that tied them to the next five minutes. In those seconds the town organized itself around the incident the way iron filings find a magnet. A woman in a red coat became a barrier with her arms spread to slow the traffic like a school crossing on a day without children. A man from an office door brought a yellow cone and placed it, reverent, near nothing in particular. The dog stopped barking and looked up at Abby as if to ask if silence was being collected for some good reason.

“Tell me about your day,” Mara said to Arthur, her voice dropping into a cadence that made people who passed glance back without knowing why. “What did you buy? Let me guess. Bread. That looks like a loaf that will sulk if not buttered properly.”

“Bread,” Arthur agreed, and his eyes relaxed in their sockets like two coins settling after spinning. “And a tin. Soup. Ridiculous, really. They don’t put enough of anything in soup now. It’s all water. Water thinking it’s carrots. My daughter—my daughter says I need more vegetables.”

“She’s right about everything,” Mara said, with the conviction of a grandchild lying to keep a man anchored. “What’s her name? We’ll tell her you were bossy today.” She glanced at Sherwood with a small tilt of her head that meant, Keep looking at his face, tell me if he is drifting.

“Claire,” he said. He blinked, slowly, like a cat forgiving the room. “She lives… Stroud. Or Cirencester. Only I forget which is which because they both sound like fainting.”

“Stroud,” Mr. Foyle supplied. “I’ve heard him complain about the hills there. Cirencester’s too smug for Claire.” He said this with authority. He reached under the duvet and found the old man’s hand and pressed it gently once, as if stamping a passport at the border between panic and something else. “You stay with us, Arthur. If you cross over without paperwork they’ll send you right back and be grumpy about it.”

The driver, white now in the way milk tries to be water, stood at the side of his car with his shoulders not yet fitting correctly on his body. A woman in a green jumper went over to him and put her hand in the air a foot away from his arm as if there were a new etiquette for contact in this moment. “Did you call?” she asked, and he nodded too many times, like agreeing could undo time. “It was wet,” he offered again. “I stopped. I did stop.”

“You stopped,” the woman said, and her voice did not choose a side, which was a kindness.

Blue lights painted everything the wrong color and then the right one. The paramedics came with their practiced calm, which is to say they came with their humanity locked into steps so nothing would spill. They made the scene look smaller, not because it was, but because that is what help does: it applies perspective like a balm. One of them knelt where Sherwood had been and asked Arthur three questions that sounded like puzzles for children. What’s your name. Do you know where you are. Do you know what happened. Arthur answered as if the quiz amused him. He got two entirely right and one approximately, and the paramedic made the approximately into something better with a nod that said you did very well and the world will not mark you down for being eighty-seven and angry at pavement.

“Do you know him,” the other paramedic asked, looking up at Sherwood and Mara in quick brackets of attention.

“We know him enough to call him Arthur,” Mara said. “He’s a regular in our day.” She stood, a little stiff, as one does after sustained kneeling, and her face did that strange shift of letting relief in and then checking it at the door, because you do not relax until the white shirts tell you that you may.

“Would you come with us,” the paramedic said, looking at them both. “Or call Claire. The notes say there’s a daughter. Numbers are funny in his pockets.”

“I’ll go,” Mr. Foyle announced, already hitching his duvet back as if anticipating a cold corridor. “He plays the same horse every Saturday and I want to tell him he’s a fool when he’s not pinned to a bed. Also, I’ll see that he doesn’t flirt with nurses his granddaughter’s age, the old pirate.”

Sherwood felt something rise in him that had the shape of a volunteer but the weight of other, and he tamped it down gently. He wanted to go. He wanted to do the part where you sit in a hospital that smells like distant oranges and tell someone’s daughter that you are not dangerous and that you will bring her father home. He also wanted to be invisible. When he imagined the hospital doors opening, he remembered that other doors opened behind them: phones, small cameras, the easy sentence, the stupid caption. He looked at Mara and he saw the same calculation cross her features and settle differently.

“I’ll call Claire,” she said. “I’ve got a good voice for apologising for other people’s days.” She had already bent to retrieve Arthur’s shopping. She nodded at Abby, who passed her a card from the paramedic with a ward’s name scribbled on it that always makes you feel like you have lost a raffle. “Foyle, you’ve got him?”

“I’ve got him,” he said, holding Arthur’s hand with the patient stubbornness of an old tugboat.

The paramedics lifted and strapped and spoke softly as if telling a bedtime story where the moral is that the bed will catch you. The crowd let them pass in a ripple of back-and-shoulder, and a space closed after the ambulance in the way spaces always close, in the way you can never quite believe there was room for the thing that just went through. The young driver stood with his hands open, palms up, as if someone were about to return something to him he had lost. A policeman who had appeared in a way that suggested teleportation pulled him to the side with the gentle pressure of one finger on an elbow. The van finally reversed and realigned as if keen to be good now that goodness was late.

And then the square was not normal again, but it was something that pretended normal so successfully the trick worked for everyone except the ones who had been holding the edges. People dispersed into their errands. A woman checked her watch. The red coat loosened its belt. Abby put her scarf back up with fingers that shook and then steadied as a matter of pride. The dog shook itself and looked pleased to have a task again: going on being a dog.

Sherwood looked at his own hands as if they belonged to a man who had been doing something meaningful. They were clean. He felt absurd about their cleanliness, and then he felt grateful. He wanted to wash them anyway. He looked at Mara. She had Arthur’s newspaper under one arm and his tin of soup in the other, like a tableau of a minor saint in a bureaucratic country. Her hair had lost its elastic again and was held in at the nape by nothing but insistence.

“Come in,” he said. “Please. Tea feels required. Or coffee that claims too much for itself.”

“Tea,” she said, the word landing in the space between them like a low cushion. “I’ll call Claire from your kitchen so the room sounds hopeful.”

They walked the short distance of geography that had become an actual journey, and his hand shook on his keys for no good reason, and the house greeted them with its faint smell of lemon and the warm ghost of a radiator that had decided to try. He filled the kettle and pretended not to notice that he was filling it wrong, the stream misaimed, his hand unfamiliar with pouring because touch had been a thing with rules in the last quarter hour. Mara leaned against the counter and looked at the corner where the plant was still deciding whether to live. “Talk to it now,” she said gently, because she could never resist turning fear into a task.

“Stay,” he told it, and the plant, to give it credit, did not at that moment drop a leaf out of spite. He slid the mugs along the counter as if he had learned something from baristas that wasn’t just names for sizes. Mara took the card the paramedic had given Abby and dialed a number printed so lightly you could tell the printer had needed persuading. She introduced herself without explaining herself, which is one of the privileges of someone who sounds like they tell the truth for a living. He heard the other person’s voice fill the line with all the first questions: where, how, but. He listened to Mara answer as if she were placing stones on a cloth to keep it from flying away. When she hung up, her face wore the dignity of someone who has just borrowed a stranger’s fear and promised to return it in better condition than received.

“She’ll go straight there,” she said. “I told her Mr. Foyle is with him. She liked that. She says he’s been feeding squirrels on Arthur’s behalf for years.” She put the card in the crack between two cookbooks as if the house now needed to absorb the fact of a hospital and make it into a decorative thing if it could.

He handed her tea and they sat at the little table near the window again, cups in the exact places their earlier conversation had left outlines for. A car went past too slowly and he watched her not flinch, admired the not-flinch, admired the practice that must have gone into it, the same way a dancer pretends floors aren’t always waiting for feet. He swallowed the thought of the man with the kind voice and the low car and he swallowed, too, the lemon having steepled itself into the air as if praying to be useful.

“You did well,” he said finally, because complimenting competence was more intimate than complimenting anything else, and he wanted to give her intimacy in amounts that wouldn’t spook it.

“I did what the poster in the GP’s surgery tells you to do,” she said. “Only, the poster doesn’t have a face. It’s easy to be brave for clip-art. It’s harder when the man is wearing a cap at an attitude.” She smiled at the memory of the cap. “We’ll go later, yes? When they’ve done their first important things, and everything is boring again. Emergencies are always least useful when you don’t have a badge.”

“Later,” he agreed. The word later felt like a promise to the version of himself who had frozen for half a second thinking about cameras. He sipped tea with the solemnity of someone partaking in a ritual that had outlasted dozens of dynasties and several kinds of trouble.

His phone, which had been sulking on the counter, brightened itself in the insolent way modern objects do when they think they have news that could make or unmake your life. Owen had called twice, which meant a third call was a legally binding certainty. Saskia had sent a text that was two parts concern to one part pre-emptive damage control: Are you okay. Pap on Montpellier Parade says incident near you. Please don’t speak to anyone. If you did, tell me you did so I can stop a ship that hasn’t sailed. Also: you are okay?

“I’m okay,” he said to the phone as if it were Saskia’s ear. He did not text back immediately because he did not want to map the moment onto the grid of necessary lies and insurance. He watched Mara’s fingers on the mug. The shape of her hold was the shape of someone who knows that warm can move from object to bone if you let it.

He did, eventually, reply: I’m fine. We helped. No press. Will call later. He typed we helped and felt both the lie and the truth in it. He had hovered obediently. He had offered a name. He had been a lit match held near a candle that would have caught anyway.

They did not speak much then. There is a silence that is just a lid, and there is a silence that is a bowl, and theirs was the latter, holding the room in one piece. Outside, the street decided not to relive its drama. It went back to letting leaves do their falling and drains do their swallowing and pedestrians do their avoiding eye contact at just the right moment to feel polite. The young driver’s car had been removed, perhaps by some theatrical crane that had learned subtlety. The van was gone. The bakery door opened and shut for a woman with a pram that looked like a minor planetary system.

After a while, Mara stood and washed their cups as if this were the last step in saving someone’s life, as if the act completed a circle she preferred not to leave open. “I should get to the shop,” she said, drying her hands on the apron still looped round her waist from earlier, as if she had been called away halfway through a hymn. “There’s a man coming in at three with a book that has been bent into the shape of his trousers and wants me to tell him it’s still literature.”

“Do you—” he said, and stopped, because the question that had formed would have been, do you want me to come carry your buckets, and that would have been an excuse to remain in her air. “Do you need anything for dinner. I can make something that pretends to be food and then we can laugh at it.”

She tilted her head, her smile the soft one again that felt like being given a coin you’d forgotten you had earned. “Bring lemons,” she said. “Not because we need them. Because oranges would be too on the nose.”

At the door, as she tied her hair back and the elastic learned, for the hundredth time, to be enough, she paused. “You shook,” she said. “Not your voice. Your hand. That’s allowed.”

“I use my hands for a living,” he said, with a self-derision he hoped read charming and not brittle. “It’s disappointing when they don’t read the cue cards.”

“They did fine,” she answered. “Sometimes what hands do is restrain themselves. That’s a skill where I come from.” She let the door open itself a little more than usual to indicate she’d like to leave and that this was no commentary on anything but motion. “Later,” she said again, and left with the sort of grace that makes the word later feel less like a boundary and more like a bridge.

He cleaned nothing and then cleaned everything. He took the newspaper that had cradled Arthur’s head and placed it under a stack of other papers as if he were pressing a flower between pages and wanted to pretend that it was entirely normal to preserve the day that way. He talked to the plant twice, once on purpose, once on accident when he forgot his mouth was open. He put on a different jumper because the lemon haunted him and because he could not justify lighting a candle when the rest of him felt like a just-extinguished match.

In the late afternoon, the messages began to slither in properly. A woman he had worked with once sent love and a question mark and a picture of a cat asleep under a radiator. A man he barely knew at a club in LA sent a video of a man base-jumping with the words Mondays, eh? which was not a comment on this particular Monday at all and was, therefore, an odd sort of relief. June left a voicemail that said, without preamble, “I saw an ambulance go up the wrong way on the Promenade, are your bones intact? Call me, or send a bee, whatever.” He called and said the word intact twice in a chronic attempt to reassure mother and self, and she said good and then said, as if this were practical, “I will bake a plum cake and if you do not need it someone will.”

At six, he knocked on Mara’s door because knocking is the oldest answer to almost any question. She opened with ink on her fingers, glue at the base of her thumb, the marks of a day that had needed repair. The piano was not playing, but the room behind her looked tuned. “He’s stable,” she said before he could ask. “Claire says he told a nurse that Stroud is pretentious and then cried because the nurse was kind back. They’re keeping him. Hip, probably. A puzzle with too few pieces. We can go tomorrow, when the world has already told the story too many times and forgotten it.”

They made a meal out of lemons and everything that had been waiting to be chosen. Pasta again, because the comfort of repetition is not to be sneered at, garlic turned down low so it could confess without shouting. He told her Owen had phoned and been decent and had said, from London, “Good job doing nothing and everything,” and she smiled at that because it was the rare sentence from that class of man that had the correct humility in it. She told him a woman had brought in a family Bible with the spine given up to fate and had cried silently while Mara sewed it back to itself. They did not talk about the car. They let the car live in the margins like a spilled drink on a page that you pretend is a feature now.

After they ate, the square outside made the particular city sound of nine o’clock, which is the sound of people choosing either bed or one more. He stood up as if to wash and sat down again as if to talk and did neither, and she watched him with the patient recognition of small fidgets and did not make them into anything larger than they were. He took a breath that was a preface. “I keep thinking,” he said, “that if I had walked over to the van earlier and told him to move, then the curb would have been clear, and then—” He did not finish because the sentence was a place you did not get out of once you went in.

“And then Arthur would have got cross at the cold in the shop because they never close the door,” she said. “And then he would have gone home and told no one about a near miss that didn’t miss. And then something else would have happened, another day, in another version of the same. We don’t get to choose the day the pavement betrays. We get to choose who is there when it does.”

He looked at her. He wanted to say I am going to make the rest of your pavements behave and knew this was one of those promises that sound like love and are actually arrogance wearing a disguise. He nodded instead, slowly, like a man at a low church who is trying to learn the hymns without the book.

Before she left, she put a small square of paper on his fridge with a magnet that said Brighton on it although neither of them had put the magnet there and neither of them had been to Brighton together. On the paper, she wrote in tiny, careful letters: Arthur Banham, Ward 4, Tuesday, visiting 2–4. Under that she drew a bee that looked like a potato with wings, and under the bee, because she could not resist making a joke cheery enough to put a crack in fear, she wrote, plant: stay. He looked at her handwriting and felt, ridiculously, that he had been given a map.

When he lay in bed later, the town outside was as quiet as counties know how to be when they have given up on loud. He heard the clocks in three different houses choose three different minutes and come near enough together that it sounded like agreement if you were generous. He saw, when he closed his eyes, not the car, but the small and stupid detail of the tin of soup rolling, stopping, rolling again when someone’s foot nudged the pavement’s secret incline. He saw Mara’s hand suspended over a shoulder it did not touch, the dignified refusal to move a body that did not need moving. He thought of the man with the kind voice and the low car and imagined the doors that close behind you and he set each of those doors on a beach somewhere in his mind and lit his lemon candle and watched their edges crisp and then vanish. He slept badly, and then he slept well, as if the night had tried him out and found him pliant.

In the morning, Cheltenham did what English towns do best: pretended nothing and everything had happened. The paper had a sentence about an elderly pedestrian and a reminder to drivers about stopping distances delivered by a councillor with a smile that was nice enough to be an apology. There was a photo, not of the scene, but of the traffic island near it, as if that would do. There was, on a page further in, a small, unnecessary mention that Sherwood Lake was seen nearby, shopping, which made the shopping feel like an accessory to all tragedy. He put the paper under the stack with the other paper, pressed today’s leaf between yesterday’s leaves, and chose to talk to the plant out loud. “We’re going to see a man,” he told it. “You will not embarrass me.”

He picked up a jar of his mother’s honey and tucked it under his arm. Mara knocked at the half-minute he expected and came in without waiting because they had crossed that particular border without needing stamps. She wore the apron but without the grease and the hoodie without the necessity. The piano had, earlier, in the morning, played the tune her nan had owned. It sat in the air like a promise kept.

“Ready,” she said. “Bring your good face. Bring the one that doesn’t tell a story about you first.”

He nodded, and they stepped out into the square, and the pigeons moved as if agreement were also a kind of flight. They walked toward the bus stop in ordinary unison, not touching, their shoulders aligned as if they had learned the same metronome, and the town, which had watched the boy leave and the man return, watched them now and practised not knowing them enough to let them go where they needed to go. They went to be looked at by white walls and fluorescent kindness, to carry in underarm honey and small jokes, to show up for a man who wore his cap like a vote in a different election. The day cleared its throat. They kept walking. The gates of the hospital opened like doors that know the difference between letting in and letting through.Chapter 4

The hospital had that varnish of efficiency that made all the colors look slightly diluted, like someone had washed them with bleach and then apologised by turning the lights up. Reception was a bank of smiles that knew exactly how to be both welcoming and refusing, a filter that let in worry but not drama. They walked along corridors whose floors whispered about mops, past noticeboards with leaflets that always seemed to be two months out of date but still dutiful. On one wall, there were framed photographs of Cheltenham races from the nineteen-seventies, horses mid-leap with the sort of heroism that was really just momentum, and for a second Sherwood saw himself in the suspend between points of ground, neither quite in the air nor on it, a creature of paused decision masquerading as grace.

Ward 4 announced itself with a swinging door that refused to swing too far, a sign that asked for silence with the politeness of a mother at a birthday party. The smell was not oranges but the idea of them, and the more honest undernote of disinfectant that had learned to be invisible from decades of practice. There were men in chairs whose faces had been taught patience by nurses and by pain. There were women making jokes in voices that had been tuned to the exact pitch of grateful defiance, as if volume could be a charm against the indignities of tubes and socks that cut at the ankle. They found Arthur by the window, because of course he would have taken light if light was on offer. His cap sat on the bedside table with the stubborn curve of a personality, his face was indignant and relieved in equal measure, and his hands were busy plucking at the blanket as if to persuade it of his continued existence.

“Ah,” he said when he saw them, as if they had arrived after a small, expected delay. “The piano. And cinema.” His voice blurred slightly at the edges, whether from painkillers or from having had to talk to too many concerned professionals about dates of birth and next of kin. He lifted a hand and it travelled through the air like a document being passed. “I told them about Stroud.”

“We heard,” Mara said, smiling a smile that would have split a smaller emergency open and let the stress leak out. “There will be letters to the editor. We brought honey, because hospitals like presents that can be put on toast.”

A nurse whose badge said JUDE in letters too small to be entirely persuasive intercepted the jar with a diplomacy that suggested years of handling gifts that teeter on the edge of hygiene. “That is very kind,” she said, her accent carrying the calm of someone who had learned to let vowels linger only as long as the job allowed. “We can’t keep it by the bed. But I can label it and put it by the nurses’ station for his daughter to take, or we can use it for the tea trolley, which has a talent for tragedy.” She smiled, the sort of smile that almost always comes after bad news, not because there had been any today, but because the muscle was used to that sequence. “He’s done well. They’re talking hip. Talking is good. It means a committee will meet and we will all pretend the committee is a friend.”

Mr. Foyle sat to the side like an old monk with a Guinness instead of a Bible, his duvet folded across his lap like an institutional stole. He looked up with an expression that managed to be both protective and amused, a grandfather guarding a misbehaving grandson. “You’re late,” he said cheerfully. “He’s already seduced two auxiliary nurses and declared war on stairs. You’ll have to settle for his second-best material.”

Claire stood at the foot of the bed with her handbag hanging off one shoulder in the way that foretold a lifetime of goodbyes at doors. She had her father’s mouth set on a younger face, her hair clipped back with a firm, practical catechism of snaps. When she saw Sherwood, her expression did that little swerve that often happens to people who have known someone as a two-dimensional thing and then found them breathing. The swerve passed and she offered a hand and a sentence that struck the careful balance between courtesy and suspicion. “You must be the neighbour who doesn’t move people,” she said. “Thank you for not moving him. I’ve been telling him for years not to try to outstare traffic lights.”

“There were more witnesses than usual,” Arthur said, his voice lifting on the word witnesses as if it tasted like a courtroom and he found that delightful. He looked at his daughter with an affection so old it had turned into teasing. “Claire, this is—”

“I know,” she said, and glanced at Sherwood with the plain, placid authority of someone who isn’t going to give you the satisfaction of saying your name. “I’ve seen you pretend to be taller. This is Mara, who told me on the phone that my father had bossed the pavement. You have the right voice for this sort of thing.”

“I practice on recalcitrant scones,” Mara answered, and Claire laughed the sweet, exhausted laugh of someone who has stored their fear in their shoes and will throw it away later, at home, over a bin.

They stood close enough to the bed to be read as friends and not so close that they would have to put their hands in what belonged to nurses. Sherwood looked at Arthur’s cap and wanted to place it back on the old man’s head out of a primitive respect for uniform, and then decided that would be a tyranny of the well-meaning. Instead he talked about the square as if it were a radio play and he had been trusted with the sound effects. “Abby says your dog friends are protesting your absence by going too near the fountain. Foyle is suspected of secret back-room squirrel deals.”

“Foyle is a communist,” Arthur murmured, and Mr. Foyle let the accusation land on him like an old coat he was used to wearing for warmth. “They’re feeding the wrong squirrels, the ones with expensive coats.”

“Don’t start on coats,” Claire said, tapping a nail on the metal foot of the bed in a rhythm that Sherwood thought he might have recognised if it had been played on a tabletop in a café. “We’ll be here until discharge arguing about textiles. What did the doctor say, Dad?”

“That he went to school with a boy who knew a man who broke both hips and still danced at his nephew’s wedding,” Arthur said. “He implied I might be excessively dramatic. I told him drama is a British product and we should be proud of it.”

“He was kind,” Jude corrected as she checked a chart hung from a clip in a gesture that had become the metronome of her days. “He will be kind again. We have you on the rota for the morning, Arthur, which means you will not enjoy your breakfast, and we will pretend you did.”

Process, like a quiet organ, began playing in the background, and they learned to talk around its keys. Sherwood found his hands again, resting them on the rail of the bed as if it were the bar of a studio set. He thought of the cameras that were not here and felt gratitude so sharp it was almost grief. People glanced at him, of course they did, because faces travel, and the ward kept its promise of English courtesy by letting the glances slip off as if greased. A boy in a hoodie seated two beds down raised his eyebrows as if asking for and offering a secret handshake and Sherwood gave the tiniest tilt of his head in return, a move he had perfected in airports and had never liked.

The quiet settled, not quite peaceful, because machines do not understand peace and talk in their own Morse code. Mara leaned her hip against the radiator and told Arthur about the piano in the way of someone describing weather, unassuming, full of small variations. She told him she had been practising the tune her nan had made hers, and he nodded and told her his mother had sung a song in a language he never learned about a woman who had drowned evening after evening and been forgiven by the river. “We would sit,” he said, “in the kitchen, and she would hum it, and the tin kettle would agree. When she died, I tried to hum it and the kettle told me off.” His eyes went watery with the memory, but not so watery he couldn’t still aim a remark at Foyle. “If this hip kills me they’ll say it was the rain, because this country likes to blame the weather for a bad day.”

“We’ll blame Stroud,” Foyle said, and then, more softly, not for arguing but for comfort, “We’ll blame nobody, Arthur. We’ll count the pills and the hours and the visitors and make a day from those.”

The young driver was not there, which Sherwood had expected and then surprised himself by regretting. He felt the shape of his own judgement like a coat he might try on and then decide against because it was the wrong season. Claire described, briefly, how the police had been gentle in the way that made her angry because gentleness is hard to argue with. “He cried,” she said, and then, because she was not cruel, “He was sorry in the exact way that counts but doesn’t undo anything. I told him to go home and not drive for a day. He said he couldn’t because he had a delivery route and bosses don’t believe in grief if it arrives without a death certificate.”

“He stopped,” Mara offered, her words carefully balanced, neither exculpation nor accusation. “He stopped, he stayed, he said his name as if it were a lock he could not open. That’s not nothing.”

“Nothing is a category that takes practice to see,” Claire said, and then she touched the rail in the exact place where Sherwood had placed his hand as if trusting that spot to hold whatever needed to be held. “Do either of you need tea. The machine downstairs has ideas above its station.”

“We brought honey,” Sherwood said again, because he wanted to be useful and the jar in Jude’s care had suddenly become a talisman in his mind. “We might try and bribe the tea into being bearable.”

Jude, making a note with one hand and fishing in a pocket with the other, produced two plastic tokens with the ease of a conjuror who loves their audience more than their trick. “On the house,” she said. “If tea was a person I would marry it, but the tea machine is something else entirely. Think of the tokens as hazard pay.” She moved away in the slow, exact music of the ward and Sherwood watched the way she placed her feet, a choreography designed to not disturb not just the sick but the illusion that time is something we control here.

They went in a small herd to the vending area because you did that in hospitals, you collected into little processions as if cameras were watching and needed evidence of human shape. The corridor widened into a square with chairs that had been designed in a year when people believed angles to be kind. A mural on the far wall showed smiling people engaging in activities no one has enough energy for when grief or pain has taken a chair at the table. The machine gave up its tea reluctantly, as if asking for reasons. Mara produced two of the collapsible cups she kept nested like little secrets in her bag, because of course she did, and Sherwood held the sugar sachets like talismans against blandness. “Honey will feel cheated,” he said. “But we can’t use it now. There are rules and I will not become the story about a famous man contaminating the NHS with unregulated amber.”

“You’ve got better at sentences no one else would ever need,” she said, and he laughed with his whole face and spilled only a little.

When they returned, Arthur was asleep with his mouth slightly open in the universal human posture that erases biography. Foyle had arranged the duvet around his shoulders with a competence that felt ancestral. Claire was on the phone in low tones, exchanging geography and childcare with someone who would take her boys for an extra night and be paid in gratitude. She held up a finger to say one minute and gestured to a chair. They sat and watched the old man’s breath. There is a humility in watching something breathe when it has recently considered not, and they shared it like you share a view through a small window, careful not to crowd.

“You shake less,” Mara said after a time, her voice not meant to be more important than the beep. “It’s a visible improvement.”

“Hands obey because we make them feel supervised,” he answered. “I thought about lighting a candle and then decided that was a ridiculous plan constrained by modern architecture.”

“You lit one in your head,” she said, and she was not wrong. “People think ritual is props. It’s really choreography for thoughts.”

They stayed until staying began to feel like performance. They left when Jude said, with a nod that covered too many kinds of departure, that visiting hours were a theatre without an encore. Claire thanked them with a hand on Mara’s shoulder and the kind of thanks that you wouldn’t dare diminish by making it bigger. She shook Sherwood’s hand with careful dryness and said, “I did like you in the one with the train. You can tell people I said that if you want. But only if it embarrasses you.”

“It will,” he promised, and she looked satisfied in the way people are when famous men admit to small humiliations on command. As they went, Foyle looked at them over the top of his folded newspaper, and there was a benediction in the small way he flicked his fingers, a blessing disguised as shooing.

The hospital spat them back out into daylight that had the thin quality of late afternoon, the kind that makes everyone look like they are walking through an old photograph. The car park measured itself by lines and fines and the kind of stern language that knows its audience will forget. On the path to the bus stop, a child in a dinosaur onesie was refusing to walk in the direction his mother wanted and was being gently persuaded by threats both ridiculous and effective. Mara watched, smiling with her mouth closed, and said, “Sometimes I think all of adulthood is negotiating with a part of you that wants to sit down and roar.”

“I got good at roaring on cue,” he said. “Now I am trying to get good at shutting up off cue.”

They did not take the bus. They found their feet preferred work, the kind of work that has the right to call itself walking. The streets between hospital and square were a braid of sad houses that had seen too many early mornings and little shops making a valiant case for staying open. A barber watched them from an empty chair with a towel over one shoulder as if ready to shave fate. A charity shop had a wedding dress in the window that had been bought once and returned to circulation with its luck carefully folded away from it. Sherwood kept expecting someone to whip out a phone, the old trench fear in his middle that was part muscle memory, part superstition. Two teenagers did clock him, and one angled his mobile for the shot so casually it was almost art, but the photo—if it existed—did not come to meet them later in the day like a poorly made mirror, and he marked the absence as a gift.

By the time the Pump Room appeared and the park opened its arms, the light had broken into the finer slivers that precede evening’s bargain. The pigeons were, in fact, orchestrating something that looked like a meeting. They walked back into the square not with triumph and not with tragedy, but with that slightly altered step you get when a building has given you back a person, temporarily repaired, and you have promised to come when it needs to do the next thing.

Abby was on her step, smoking with the solemnity of someone playing a flute badly at a wake, the dog in his jumper pretending not to be complicit. She asked nothing with her mouth and everything with her eyes, and they answered both the question and the courtesy with a set of nods that would have required subtitles in a less practised place. “Good,” she said, as if they had turned in a piece of homework she had asked for. “He’ll be a bastard now. That’s how you know people are getting better.” She stubbed her cigarette out on a ledge that had been worn obedient by habit and then looked at Sherwood with a cheekiness that could get away with anything. “You were in the Echo today buying soap. You looked mournful. Are you all right or are you becoming a man of scented candles and introspection.”

“Both,” he said, and she laughed, cupping the dog’s face as if he might appreciate irony.

Owen rang while he was at his sink washing two cups he had already washed, which is to say he was avoiding the moment where the hospital’s smells would evaporate and he would be left with the lemon again. “I’m going to try the thing where I am an adult and ask you how you are first,” Owen said, his voice doing that half-American, half-London stretch that made him sound like a radio station scanning. “How are you. Don’t answer in the tone of a man writing a poem about frost.”

“I am all right,” Sherwood said, which was true enough to pass. “We did the right steps in the right order. There are nurses who could form a government, if anyone were interested in results.”

“Don’t put that tweet into the world, we need the nurses where they are,” Owen said. “Listen. Two things. One, you are near two angles of this story that the internet likes. The act of not moving a man, and the act of being seen in a hospital. Saskia says keep your head down and your jaw unclenched and if anyone rings who doesn’t sound like they have access to morphine, hang up. Two, there is this script that has got legs all of a sudden. British, for once. BBC with money, which is like saying a priest with a nightclub. It’s in Bristol for prep, Cardiff for shoot. If you are, by any chance, against airports at the moment, this might be medicine.”

Sherwood looked at the plant, which had not died out of melodrama yet. The idea of a job that required a motorway rather than a passport made something settle in him, not entirely relief, but a cousin of it. “Send it,” he said. “Send it with the usual apology for me being himself.”

“You are at your best when you are himself,” Owen said. “Or when you are not himself but you do a good impression. I’ll send it. Also, your mother rang me and told me to make sure you were not living on crisps. She is fierce and I have bought a bag of plums in her honour, which I will give to someone with a better kitchen.” He paused, as if hesitant to tread into a part of the conversation where jokes did not like to live. “You did good. Not the big heroism that gets people posters. The kind where you keep your hands off. That’s the adult kind.”

After he hung up, Sherwood stood with the phone warm in his palm and felt a very old memory arrive and sit down. He was fourteen, maybe, and in his father’s garage where the spanners had the serious, oily weight of someone else’s competence. His father had been taking a radio apart because it had sinned by growing silent. “You want to fix it by touching it,” his father had said, his hands moving the way men’s hands move when they know they are good at something they cannot explain. “You want to poke the part that hurts. What I learned is sometimes you keep your hands behind your back and think for a minute. Then you touch once, and you touch right.” He had loved his father then with the clenched devotion of boys who suspect their god is not long for this altar, and he felt that love again now, thirteen years and a sea away, standing in a rented kitchen in a town his father never bothered to understand. He spoke into the room without meaning to. “I kept my hands behind my back,” he said, and the room, being a room, let the sentence settle into its corners and become part of the dust.

Mara knocked because knocking is a habit that remains even when doors have become friendly. She had a pack of lemons in one hand like a bouquet after a peculiar wedding. “I wrote my first cross letter in ages,” she said, pushing the lemons into his grip as if they had been too opinionated and needed new company. “Driver of the van, care of the delivery depot, cc the pavement, bcc the council, p.s. Stroud. Nothing ugly. Just the sort of cross that wears a cardigan. I told him his hazard lights are not a personality.”

“You are the queen of the useful rebuke,” he said, putting the lemons at the plant’s base like offerings to a small domestic god. He told her about the BBC script without too many adjectives, and she looked pleased in a way that had nothing to do with admiration and everything to do with logistics. “Bristol, Cardiff,” she said. “You’ll need a thermos and a coat that lies to you about the rain. You can come home on Sundays and tell the plant lies about how you missed it.”

“Will you play for it,” he asked impulsively, and when she frowned, not in confusion but in the way of someone who likes to see a thing before naming it, he flinched at his own omnivorousness. “I mean—would you help me read. Sometimes I hear a scene better when someone else is inside the room with me. It’s greedy, asking. I know you stitch spines; it feels wrong to ask you to help me pretend I have one.”

“I will be a woman who says lines,” she said, and the smile she wore was the sort a person puts on when a door opens into a bright room they did not know was in their own house. “Bring it when it arrives. We will see if this person you will be is kind to his neighbours and whether he has the good sense to be badly behaved only in the parts of the story that can survive it.”

They ate something again that had the dignity of plainness. He told her the story of the wedding dress in the charity shop and she told him about a book that had come in with the cover stripped and how she had glued it to a new spine and thought, not for the first time, that some objects take repair like compliments while others take it like pity. The piano, when she went back to her house, played three notes like someone gently clearing their throat.

Days folded. Arthur had the operation and left the ward for a corridor with a different colour and a nurse named COLLINS whose badge announced the surname like a verdict. He celebrated with ice chips and a speech he would not remember about socialism, dogs, and the scandal of the price of jam. Mr. Foyle developed a new air of responsibility that looked good on him, as if he had been waiting for permission to be indispensable. Abby began a rumour that the hospital coffee was now slightly less tragic because Jude had found a way to bribe the machine with honey. The young driver left a note with Abby for Claire that said in shaky capitals SORRY LIKE WHEN THE SKY FALLS ON TV and underlined sorry twice, as if to perform penance with ink.

The square, being a square, took these things into itself and continued to be a rectangle of grass where people chose to sit or not sit based on the weather and the private weather that human bodies carry. Sherwood read the script on his sofa with a pencil in his mouth because some primitive part of him believed that tasting graphite was linked to intelligence. It was good in the way pieces sometimes are when they do not try to be monuments. It was about a man who had gone away to fail at glamor and returned to find he had become useful in the wrong town. There were sentences he could carry. There was a scene in a laundrette that would need to be cut or made so precise it felt like someone showing you a scar. There was a woman who mended things because she liked the sound of thread. He did not know whether life had been eavesdropping or whether writers had decided that they might as well steal what sits openly on our doorsteps.

They read together, taking the parts that winked and the ones that didn’t, sitting across his little table with the window behind the words and the plant like an audience member that cares too much. Mara had a knack for pacing that made him suspect she had been faithful to metronomes as a child, not because anyone had forced her to but because she liked the comfort of right counts. She changed her voice without changing it, the way good readers do, and a man who wrote things down somewhere had his day repaired by someone who had not met him and liked him anyway. When they finished for the first time, she looked at him and said, “He is a man who pretends to hate people who recognise him because he believes recognition is lazy. He is wrong, but it is a kind of wrong that makes sense.”

“I can find that,” he said, and believed it, because he knew how to fake disgust and then tuck it away when the scene changed. He sent Owen a voice note with clauses in it that ended where they wanted to, and Owen sent back five thumbs and a contract disguised as consolation.

It did not all bend toward the pattern they thought they could sketch. One night, late, the paparazzo did arrive, as if grief and relief had created a flare that took a while to climb into the sky. He stood across the square with an expensive lens and the posture of a man who would be polite to a bouncer but steal a bouncer’s name. He did not come close, which was either courtesy or cowardice or fear of Mr. Foyle, who had been known to use his trolley like an instrument. Sherwood saw him through the gap in the curtains and felt that old prickle on the back of his neck like a cat noticing a draught. He almost didn’t say anything about it to Mara, because telling is a kind of invitation, but habit made him honest. “There’s a man with a camera,” he texted, feeling ridiculous again because the sentence sounded like a plot twist written by an intern.

She replied while he watched the glow of her phone move in her window like a lazy firefly. He imagined her thumb finding its small target and felt, unexpectedly, a tenderness for the tiny practicalities of her body. She wrote, He will get bored. If he doesn’t, Abby will sit on him. She followed it with, If you need to, come round for a cup that makes a photo boring.

He didn’t go round, not because pride said don’t but because staying in his own rooms felt like an act of domesticated defiance. He made tea. He turned off the light in the hallway so the lemon didn’t make the room look nervous. He spoke softly to the plant and said, “Pretend you are a hedge,” and made himself laugh. He waited. The man with the camera yawned in a way that was possibly for show and then left, the long black line of his equipment on his shoulder like a contrition he didn’t feel. Mr. Foyle saluted him as he went, which the man did not know how to respond to because there were no buttons to press on a salute.

In the morning, Sherwood walked to the park early and let his feet find, as they often did, the thin path that skirts the water with the carefulness of a lover. A man was fishing from a bench with a line that looked more like a suggestion to the fish than a plan, his thermos beside him like a little submarine. The water did not care what had happened yesterday. Mara joined him halfway without announcement, the noise of her step on the gravel something he had already taught himself not to flinch at. “I dreamed about doors again,” she said, in the tone of someone reporting weather. “Only this time they were soft. Like theatre curtains.”

“Did they close,” he asked, not as a therapist but as a person who had slept in the same town.

“They did,” she said. “But when I pushed, they moved. It was funny. I woke up laughing and the laugh had nowhere to go, so it sat on my chest for a bit and then slid off.”

They talked about everything else that morning, perhaps because everything else had learned to be easier. He told her a story about LA where people applauded sunsets, not because the sunsets were particularly good but because applause was a muscle you had to keep strong. She told him about the woman in the bookshop who had asked for a book “for someone who is not well yet,” a category Mara loved so much she wanted to invent a shelf for it with a sign in nice handwriting and a bowl beside it full of wrapped chocolates with permission tied to each piece. The girl from the café nodded at them from a distance as if they were her regulars now and she would take it personally if they did not come for scones on Thursdays. He picked up a leaf that had decided to go red on its own schedule and put it in his pocket like a note from a friend that said, Remember to look down.

The day the young driver returned to the square was a day the weather could not decide. He sat on a bench and looked at his shoes for ten minutes in a way that would have made someone think of prayer if they had wanted to be dramatic about it. He had the decency not to arrive at a time when Claire was there. He had a paper bag with something that had made grease circles on the outside, and he had nothing like a plan. Sherwood watched him from his window because privacy was a game you played with yourself as well as others. He went out because it felt wrong to rehearse compassion indoors.

The boy—man, but he would be a boy in this memory for years—stood when Sherwood approached and then sat again because standing made it too formal. He looked not at Sherwood’s face but at the part of a person you look at when you are trying to demonstrate that you are not challenging them, which is somewhere near the clavicle. “I wrote the note,” he said, as if he had been charged and was entering his plea. “The one with the telly sky. I shouldn’t have said telly. I didn’t mean it like I was making light. My mum says I shouldn’t talk when I’m sorry because my mouth ruins it.”

“I got sorry,” Sherwood said. “Sorry arrived just fine. I gave it to Claire. She knows what to do with it.” He sat on the bench and the boy shifted half an inch, a motion like the moving of a seat on a long-distance bus, small and heavy. “What’s your name.”

“Dale,” he said. “Like valleys. I don’t like valleys much. Hills are honest. Valleys hide the next thing.”

“Dale,” Sherwood repeated, because names are a way to make a person stay in the room. “Do you want me to tell you that it wasn’t your fault. I won’t. It was a wet road and a man, and you, and the day. They all did it together.”

“I looked,” Dale said, and he said it again because sometimes you need to hear your defence twice before it becomes part of your story. “I looked, I braked, I thought I stopped. I had a sandwich in the van and I didn’t eat it after. Like that helps, yeah. Like adding hunger to it makes it moral.” He made a sound that was a laugh without air. “I work. I can’t not. If I stop they’ll find another boy who doesn’t yet understand that the world needs you to be a person and a machine at once.”

“You came back here,” Sherwood said, as if that were a medal he could pin. “That is not nothing. Sit anyway, Dale. People will not love you because of it. But they will have less to do when they are deciding whether to blame you in their own heads.”

Dale nodded in the way of someone who had expected to be allowed to cry and was now being allowed to live. He opened the paper bag as if producing a rabbit and showed Sherwood a bun the size of a fist glazed with the humility of corner bakeries. “I was going to give this to the old bloke,” he said, morose and self-mocking in the same breath. “I thought he might like sugar. It’s stupid.”

“Keep it,” Sherwood said. “Promise me you’ll eat it. Then one day, when he is home and loud and complaining about Stroud, you can bring a bun and act like there was never any other way the story could go.”

He left the boy on the bench and did not look back because sometimes the gift you can give is to remove the audience. He went to Mara’s door and knocked twice in a tune that had begun to become theirs, two soft notes, one long. She opened with paste on her fingers and a strand of hair that had escaped and had been captured again with a clip that made a noise he liked. “You had the conversation,” she said before he had the chance to decide how to name it. “He is on a bench and a bun is looking embarrassed. You did fine.”

“Sometimes I want a priest to teach me how to absolve without lying,” he said, and she put the heel of her hand to his sternum in a gesture so quick and honest it bypassed the usual embarrassment. It was not a romantic touch, or perhaps it was romantic in the largest sense of that word, the one that means we accept the world is full of impossible things and we keep our eyes open anyway. “Move your breath,” she said. “You keep letting it live there.”

He breathed, because he had learned to on command. The plant threw a new leaf the next day, very small, a gesture more of intention than of achievement, and he felt ridiculously seen by a piece of green plasticity. He told it so and Mara sounded the two notes that meant she understood and was making tea.

When the script came back with notes—kind, curious, nibbling at the edges of scenes that would never be filmed exactly as written—he showed her the margin scribbles as if they were glories. They read the laundrette scene again and this time laughed where they had not before, because it had learned to be specific, and specificity is comedy’s best suit. She taught him a way to fold a line around a breath that improved it not because she had any training in that field but because she had listened to the radio as a child and imitated the cadences of quiet men in the afternoon. He thought, in the downtimes between syllables, that there are ways of being loved that are simply the body being handed the right timing, and he wondered if he could deserve that without having done anything terrible, if there were no cosmic scales to adjust.

On a willfully ordinary Tuesday, he sat on the step with his back to the city and watched the sky change its mind. The square was almost empty apart from an old woman who had decided to take a bench personally and a boy whose skateboard sounded like a sewing machine. Mara came out and sat beside him, close enough that their arms knew where to be, and they watched two girls practise cartwheels with the kind of courage that only breaks bones when someone else watches. “Do you remember,” she asked, “the first thing you noticed about the town when you left.”

“How water here thinks differently,” he said without needing to search. “In L.A. the air is a dry argument. Here, everything is a soft insistence. You cannot not be damp. Even when your problems have nothing to do with it.”

She considered this and nodded, her eyes following a cloud as if she might persuade it to sit for a minute. “I noticed the way people use each other’s names like they were borrowed. You hear your name in the high street here and it could be the one you were born with or the one they call you when they are trying to be kind. I think that’s why I like to sew the names back into books. They go missing so easily.”

He looked at her profile and at the corner of her mouth where humour lived and at the place in front of her ear where her hair had decided to curl. He thought the dangerous thought again, the one that made a crane fold itself out of paper in his mouth, and he took it out and put it in his pocket and told himself that there would be a day when letting it fly would not feel like throwing a spice into the wrong pan and setting off a smoke alarm. He had, after all, a job to take that would take him away but not away-away, a thing to do that would show him what kind of man he could be when not watched by the people who had watched the boy leave. There were hospital corridors to walk in with better news and a man with a cap to bring buns to and a young driver to greet with the sort of nod that says, there is still work without penance and you are entitled to three jokes today.

Phones would ring again and announce the outside world’s desire to shape his days. Bees would hum at his mother’s elbow in Bangor Villas and turn sunlight into a thing you could put on toast. The plant would either die or not, and either way he would talk to it and share the blame with himself and the fact of a north-facing window. The piano would learn the Schubert it denied and keep the nan’s tune regardless, and he would stand in doorways and feel the length of his arms and understand that this, too, is a way to measure a life. For now, he sat on the step where the paint had learned to flake, a famous man trying not to be obliged, a woman who bound spines and saved books from bag-shapes, two people who shared a corridor and a town and the small necessary business of later.Chapter 6

The first read-through was in a Bristol building that had been designed by someone who believed beige could be a lifestyle. The carpets had ambitions to swallow sound and the windows were the kind that show you a version of yourself in which you are trying to be professional. Sherwood sat at a table with a jug of water that had sprigs of something green in it as if the water might be persuaded to heal through garnish. The director was a woman with a scarf that made its own weather system; she had a voice that could make bad news feel like a note added to a chord that you had not known was missing. The writer looked like he wanted to apologise to everyone in advance and afterwards and to every cup his fingers would pick up in between. The other actors were a mix of faces that might become your future and faces you had wanted to be recognised by when you were twenty. Someone from sound fiddled with a small black box like it was a bomb or a beetle. He texted Mara a picture of his pencil and wrote, In case I forget why I am here, I have brought this weapon. She replied, Breathe at commas, stop at full stops, and don’t let them make you tell a joke you wouldn’t laugh at if it was yours.

He liked the part in the way you like someone who makes you better at yourself by accident. The man in the script had lines that rolled easily in the mouth and then got stuck like a stray seed between two teeth when they tried to be more eloquent than honest. In the scene-by-scene, Sherwood found himself putting his hand near his heart without meaning to when the laundrette came up, the one that had been rewritten to sound like something a person could overhear and believe had happened. Saira, who was playing the woman with more sense than was comfortable, read in a tone that could butter bread without a knife. After the first pass, the director said, mild as weather, “Let’s let it be less good. Let’s let it be a little bit wrong and then we can call it ours,” and the room relaxed because permission to be imperfect is the only form of grace that really works in public.

He drove back to Cheltenham on a road that kept showing him a sky that did not trust itself, a sky that thought of rain the way people think of messages they should not send. The M5 had its usual poker face; lorries moved like sad caravans of necessary. He pulled into an anonymous services and watched a family conduct peace talks between two children with the listlessness of diplomats who have been sent to a country they cannot pronounce. He stood in a queue for coffee and a man with a face that had seen him on a billboard did a double take and then chose, admirably, to decide that the queue was a sacred space where no one has to be anyone. The ordinary was very good at keeping his temperature right. By the time he turned onto Imperial Square, the piano had set up a pattern in the evening air and the town, in the usual way, announced with the smell of dinners and the distant bark that people were continuing to not be extraordinary with great success.

He found Mara mid-glue, a small wilderness of boards and cloth on her table, her fingers serious with purpose. She welcomed him with the kind of nod that says you are not a disruption to a day but an ingredient. He told her about Saira and the scarf and the director’s invitation to be less good. She listened with the patience of a person who has learned to treat other people’s successes with the tenderness usually reserved for their wounds. When he confessed, low and quick because the admission embarrassed him in the way that being relieved can, that he had felt his hands very calm at the table and had not shaken once, she looked pleased in a way that had nothing to do with pride and everything to do with keeping count on his behalf of the quiet victories you cannot post about. “Muscle memory,” she said, picking up a needle with her other hand as if to prove the point. “Your body is learning it can do more than make panic look expensive. Come here and read me the man who doesn’t like recognition because he thinks it is lazy. I’ll be the woman who recognises him for free and still asks him to pass the salt.”

The first low shot of attention came not from Bristol but from home, because attention is a homing pigeon that will always prefer the familiar rooftop. A photograph appeared online of Sherwood’s front steps with a shadow on them that a tabloid, in its poet’s handwriting, labelled as a woman’s silhouette. The photograph did not have the decency to be clear or the kindness to be useful. The caption guessed at a romance because captions are paid for guesses and never rewarded for silence. Atkinson’s Coffee made an appearance in the comments as if a brand could be a culprit. Two boys in hoodies loitered that afternoon near the door to ask for iced lattes in November because this is what boys will do when encouraged by spectacle; they looked disappointed when they got coffee and not a scandal. Mara wiped her hands on her apron and gave them a loyalty card and told them the offer did not extend to idiocy. They laughed, because idiocy is unreasonable until a woman in an apron names it and then it is almost courtly to submit.

He asked Owen how much ignoring constitutes a strategy and what the half-life of a shadow is. Owen said, “Ninety-six hours and a new headline,” and in the same breath asked him to send a photo of a page from the script with three question marks where his lines had been replaced by bracketed improvisation. Saskia sent him a text that was, for her, practically a lullaby: Don’t post. Don’t wink. Don’t look out of a window as if performing longing. Do nothing. It reads better than any words you could give them. He did nothing with an assiduousness that felt athletic. He bought a loaf from the bakery and held it openly in daylight, a gesture so nakedly domestic the man with the long lens across the square blushed and went home.

Arthur came back like a returning government with less pomp and more paperwork. Claire wore her readiness like armour and a cardigan. Mr. Foyle supervised the installation of a grab rail with the expression of a foreman who has blacklisted larger men for less. Arthur resisted the walking frame by insulting its name. “Zimmer. It sounds like a bedroom,” he muttered, and the frame, to its credit, refused to take offence. He was more indignant than in pain, which everyone understood was a good sign. Sherwood helped carry in a plastic bag containing dignity in the form of new pyjamas and the kind of biscuits that pretend they are health food because a doctor once glanced at them. Mara had made a cushion that had bees on it stitched in a way that made them look like they hummed if you didn’t stare too hard. She threaded it behind Arthur’s back with the deftness of a pickpocket and told him to lean on what worked. He tried the cap on his head, declared it too victorious for a convalescent, and placed it with deliberate care on the arm of the chair where it could act as a warning to any sadness that dared to come into the room uninvited.

He watched, and told no one, how his heartbeat eased when Arthur laughed and let someone else win an argument. It rearranged a piece of furniture in him that had been in the wrong place. The square resumed its study of the ordinary, and in the odd quiet between scenes he and Mara edged into the days like people learning to dance without a teacher. He read lines at her table while she cut cloth. She played him two bars and then a bar rescued from a memory when glue needed drying and the world could manage without her commentary for a minute. Sometimes they sat without speaking for so long that you could hear the boiler consider its future. He cooked, when cooking was bravely too strong a word, things that could be forgivable if served with the apology of salad. She brought a jar with a label that said Marmalade in handwriting that could have been a portrait of patience. The marmalade was so decisively bitter he said, “This is how I will learn to be a man,” and she said, “No, that ship has sailed and sank elegantly. Eat your toast.”

In the second week of Bristol, the production took over a laundrette with a smell so clean it could have confronted sin and made it sit down. The owner watched from a small stool like a queen considering taxation. Sherwood found himself practicing folding at speed while a woman from continuity took photographs of his hands arranging towels into bowls. Saira walked in with a line that on paper had felt like a plank and in her mouth became a bridge, and he said his answer without performing his face because he had started to believe that ease would forgive his vanity. Between takes he texted Mara a picture of a washing machine door with a face in it that was obviously trying to be symbolic and she replied with a photo of a spine she had just sewed, a perfect line of little stairs up the side of a broken book, and wrote, Both of us: round and round and showing up in cycles. He put his phone away and did not check whether anyone had decided to be interested in his lunch.

It was Abby, in the end, and not a paper, who brought trouble to the door, because Abby liked to practice bravery in little acts and kept having to escalate to keep herself interested. A man came into Atkinson’s with a camera he pretended was a phone and asked for a frappé with his hand held at an angle that made your blood know something it had no reason to. Mara saw him and saw, too, where he had come from, which was the edge of a story that did not belong to him. She put his drink down like a teacher placing a grade on a desk and said, in a voice that had equal parts rain and brass, “No pictures in here. We have a sign.” There was a sign, in fact, a small polite one near the cakes about humanity and crumbs. He smiled the smile of a man whose mother had not taught him that the first person to break courtesy is not the one who gets to keep it. “Public figure,” he murmured, as if that were a spell that made rooms abandon their thresholds. She said, “This is a private cake,” and he didn’t like it, and Abby, whose dog had taken against the man’s trousers, stood up, cigarette in hand like a wand, and stepped very slightly into the man’s personal space. “We are public too,” she said, and the dog, perfect conspirator, sneezed as if to punctuate, and the man left because sometimes resistance works when it does not look like it will.

She told Sherwood that night not because she wanted him to go out and challenge someone to pistols at dawn but because she believed he might be foolish enough to blame himself for a world that had not been designed by either of their hands. He went quiet in the way that made her tap a finger against her mug to check he was still there. He said, at last, the sentence he had promised himself he would say one day, something careless that could be loved or dropped without breaking everything. “I miss you when I am in rooms full of people,” he said. The words did not hurt as they left his mouth. They did not set off the smoke alarm. They did not even make the lemon candle falter. She looked at him and her face did not do drama, it did something he had not learned in any class; it softened not as if about to cry but as if about to sleep well. “Good,” she said. “That’s the right amount of missing.”

He kissed her then, because it was the next line in the play as far as his body had written it, and because the room was listening kindly. It was not a scene with a soundtrack or a crane shot; it was a slow, true thing, a thought phrased properly at last. She tasted like tea and a lemon that had been taught to calm down. His hands behaved as if they had been on set all day and were now off duty, careful, not trying to hold the whole woman at once as if she might run, not trying to say more than his mouth had said. She made the smallest noise when they broke apart, as if something had fallen into place on a shelf and she wanted to mark the moment for later tidying. Then she laughed like a woman who has just got the joke before anyone said it, and said, “Now we have to unmuddle how we live not in a new way, but in an old way that works.”

Unmuddling was a series of domestic treaties. They did not move toothbrushes. They did not announce anything to Abby, which meant Abby correctly deduced in a day and a half and decided to bless them by buying a plant because she believed greenery made sins look tasteful. The plant was ridiculous, something ferny and optimistic, and they put it next to the disobedient one as if introducing cousins and hoping temperament is catching. They learned to leave each other space on stairs. He discovered that she liked to resolve arguments by washing a cup with undue attention and that if he made her laugh in the middle of the second rinse she would forgive him for whatever oversight had gotten him into the argument in the first place. She learned that he could be trusted to not make her into a photograph in his head. He discovered that it was possible to be touched lightly and not translate it into either debt or theatre. She discovered that saying the word love under her breath where it could not be overheard did not make the walls collapse out of spite.

The young driver, Dale, became a regular in the square, not out of penitence now but because the bench had stopped being an altar and started being a chair. He took to learning the exact times of the buses, not quite like a man considering a new religion, more like a man making an agreement with something bigger than him that he could not afford but would not steal. Claire, hard-eyed and fair, shook his hand once, a quick clasp that finished a transaction without breast-beating. Arthur shouted at a pigeon and then told Dale that if he was going to feed the squirrels he had to accept that pigeons were rude cousins and you cannot avoid them at weddings. Mr. Foyle collected three more duvet covers and became, to Sherwood’s private joy, a moving landscape feature in the town that no tourist would know how to explain.

He took Mara to Bristol a couple of times, not to show her off—he was learning that the things you love are not improved by being turned into exhibits—but because the day wanted a companion. They walked down a street of graffiti that had learned to speak in complete sentences and then slipped into a café where the tables were too close and therefore human. He read her a scene in a corner under a framed poster for a band that had given up in 2002 and discovered that being slightly afraid of being overheard made him honest in ways studio walls did not. She went once to the production office, which smelled like printed paper and hand gel, and shook the director’s hand and was looked at by three people who had seen her in a photograph in an email that had not meant to be cruel but was, and she held herself in that particular way she had when she knew she could be mistaken for a mistake and refused to be. Saira hugged her as if it were normal and introduced her, without reference to him at all, as the woman whose hands had the needle dignity. On the way home they bought a packet of plum tomatoes because they were on offer and she said, “I think your work is more exhausting than it looks,” and he said, “Your work is more exact,” and they were both right and both wrong in the way people are when they are casting about for equivalence and find instead love disguised as algebra.

June’s bees did what bees do and ignored almost everything in favour of flowers and weather. He drove to Bangor Villas one morning after a night shoot and found his mother in wellies and a dressing gown looking like the sort of deity you might trust with your car keys. She fed him toast and did not ask questions about women or scripts, which was her way of creating the space in which answers might arrive dressed as confessions or recipes. He told her, anyway, in a way that he did not often give himself permission to, about a woman who laced book spines back into coherence and played a tune that had belonged to an old woman and a kitchen. June nodded and said, “That will do,” as if he had brought her exactly the right ingredient. She showed him a bee that had got stuck on a windowsill and he watched her nudge it back to the air with a patience that made him aware that he had grown up among quiet professionals of the soul.

There was a letter in the Cheltenham paper, signed only with the initial M, that was stern about vans on pavements and the mathematics of stopping distances and the particular manners of streets that wish to be loved. It was not splendid, not wild; it was the sort of letter that wears neat shoes and gets results. The council wrote back in the same edition with a paragraph that sounded tired and a promise to discuss signage. An older woman stopped Mara on the Promenade and said, “Thank you for using long sentences,” and Mara smiled and said, “They take longer but they hold more,” and the woman nodded in approval as if shown a new bag in a shop. Sherwood wanted to put the letter in a frame and decided this would be out of proportion and therefore tender in the wrong way. Instead, he folded it and put it inside the book that had held Arthur’s head as if paper remembered paper and would keep it safe.

He did not tell Mara when he was afraid because she did not ask him to, but sometimes the fear arrived in a way that could not be smuggled past her. It looked like him standing up halfway through a film and walking to the kitchen as if his legs were looking for a job. It sounded like him not speaking for a full minute while the kettle found what it was for. It tasted like tea that had been brewed too long out of courtesy to distraction. She learned to put her hand flat on the table, palm down, cool on wood, and he learned to place his own hand near, not over, and match his breath to nothing obvious until they were simply two people at a table with hands that had decided not to ruin anything that day. In return, he learned her quiet. It arrived like her turning a page more slowly than the book wanted, like her standing up and then sitting down again at the piano, like her saying, “I am forgiven,” about something he hadn’t seen and then forgiving herself again just to check.

It would have been too neat if everything had continued in that key, and life does not like neat except on shop shelves. The BBC sent notes about a scene that Sherwood privately thought was the backbone of the first episode. They wanted it less sharp. They wanted him to smile through a grief because it read better on the production grid. He felt a kind of despair that was not dramatic, more like a cupboard door that always sticks on the same half-inch. He argued in sentences that began politely and ended on a cliff. He came home and told Mara the whole case as if he were a barrister who understood that to be persuasive you must be a little boring. She listened and then asked the unkind question kindly. “Is it that the scene is better your way,” she said, “or that you are better at the scene your way.” He had the decency to laugh and then to try again in the morning with a new face and a better line. At the read-through, he found a version where his man did smile and it did not mean he had forgiven the world; it meant he had worked out where to put his mouth while he waited for the world to admit it had been heavy-handed. He texted her, You meddled me into being right, and she sent back a picture of the plant throwing another leaf and wrote, It was teamwork, and he believed her, which was a kind of miracle.

The winter had a go at being serious. Frost stayed too long on grass like a guest who will not take the hint. The square walked people in smaller circles. The dog’s jumper got upgraded to something with a hood that would have made a poet complain. There was a night where the pipes made the sound of someone dragging a chair over an old floor and both of them woke thinking they had said each other’s names and were disappointed and pleased to find the house had simply been talking. He bought a better radiator out of guilt and she bought a thicker curtain out of thrift and together the room learned how to hold heat like a verdict.

On the way back from Bristol one evening, a fox crossed the road with the absolute conviction of royalty. He slowed and watched it go, its tail doing that lithe, disdainful thing that animals do when they have memorised their own myth. When he told Mara about it, she said, “We had a fox at the back of our garden when I was small who used to sit like a cat and stare as if to say, you are the ones who have introduced the concept of rent to this terrain,” and he fell, again, in the quiet way that does not leave a bruise. He found that he could be in love not like a man falling off something but like a man deciding where to put shelves. It was, unaccountably, better.

One afternoon, the washing line of the square hung its weather in a perfect order, three white shirts, a towel with a faded cartoon lion, two pillowcases that had seen better nights. Abby sat with her scarf like a flag. Mr. Foyle practised frowning with gravitas at a teenager who was trying to teach his body to succeed at a skateboard trick that could only be described as ambitious to the point of theology. Arthur, triumphant, made it to the bench and declared himself king of the pigeons and then accepted a bun from Dale with the solemnity of a man accepting an apology in bread. Sherwood walked back from the shop with three lemons because it had become their private joke and because winter needs yellow the way cups need handles. Mara opened her door and he held them up and she said, “We might never get tired of this,” and he said, “Then it will be a tradition and not a rut,” and she said, “Good,” and the plant, conspiring at last, did not drop a leaf out of spite. The piano offered itself to the room with a tune that had never belonged to Schubert and always to a woman in a kitchen with a kettle that did not understand grief and hummed anyway, and he thought, briefly and accurately, that if the work and the days and the hands behaved, you could get to old in a town like this and not feel much like you had missed the right exits.

When the call came from Owen about the shoot dates firming and a Cardiff winter that would need bravery and thermals, he took it with the pleasure of someone being assigned labour that suits their bones. He told Mara the dates and she said, “I will write the times on a piece of paper and pretend the paper can hold the days fast,” which was her way of saying she would miss him correctly, at the edges where the day frays. He asked her, because it felt important to ask questions even when you thought you knew the answers, if she wanted him to pretend to the world that nothing had changed, and she said, “I want the world to mind its own, and I want you to be better than your fear when you can. The days you can’t, I will not give you points off.” He laughed and put his hand near her face without touching and watched the way her eyes warmed and how his body learned something new and ordinary in that warmth.

On the last night before call time, they walked to the Pump Room and stood outside under the kind of moon that looks like an old coin someone has polished too hard. The building did its usual trick of making you feel aristocratic and ridiculous simultaneously. They stood not quite close and not far, two people who had learned a new distance that was better than romance in films. He said, from a place in his chest he was beginning to recognise as a door with a latch you can lift without your hands shaking, “I am going to come back every weekend and act like Sunday is a religion,” and she said, “I will make hot things and talk to the plant about the days like it could keep them for us,” and he said, “Later,” and she said, “Later,” and the town, which had mispronounced cinema enough times to have earned its own say, bore witness with a small wind and the sound of someone locking a bicycle to a railing with a hopeful click.Chapter 8

Cardiff wore its winter like a shrug it had decided to mean. The production office had moved into a building that had been a school and still remembered timetables; corridors smelt of wet coats and the kind of coffee that forgives you for not sleeping. Sherwood did the ritual of the call sheet pinned by the kettle, did the ritual of nodding to faces you know only by the way they carry cables, did the ritual of standing on tape marks that pretended to be decisions. The city gave him a sky that could not keep its mind and a wind that had learned the alphabet only to spell out the words go inside. He drove the first week, then took the train, then drove again because trains insisted on other people’s conversations and the car let him line up thoughts in lanes that merged when he asked. He told himself he was learning the art of departure without theatrics and the even harder art of return without apology, and some days he believed himself.

He and Mara invented small machines for distance. She sent a photograph of her hand after a day of binding, the fingers ghosted with glue like a gentle frost, and he sent back a picture of his knuckles with a half-worn X from makeup that marked him for a bruise he would never earn. He took a video of the sound a foghorn made on a night shoot at the docks and she sent a recording of her piano playing a chord that was mostly room and a little note. They set their phones on the table during quick suppers and pretended the other person was a heat source rather than a rectangle. He learned that her silences travel as well as her words. She learned the way his sighs meant no rather than tired when they belonged to Cardiff and not to him. When he slept badly in hotel bedding that always smelled faintly like other plans, she texted him, Close your eyes at commas, and if you wake, move your breath. He followed the instruction with the obedience of a man who has discovered he is not better than advice.

Atkinson’s Coffee embraced winter by deciding to believe in nutmeg. The bell on the door kept its small private joy, and Mara grew an extra layer of patience for people whose hands had forgotten what coins feel like. She bound ledgers that had lived in desk drawers under receipts from the nineteen-nineties and made them straight again. She learned the names of three new regulars and discovered two had already been characters in Abby’s stories. The piano behaved like a pet that understands a house has moods; it spoke when she asked and kept quiet when the square needed less. When the skin by her nail split from the cold and returned the favour of her work, she wrapped it with tape and made music anyway. She missed him at specific times that looked unremarkable from the outside: three minutes after the kettle finished, three steps from her door to his when she did not take them, the ten seconds on the stairs when she would have had to ask him to shift because his feet were always in the wrong place. She told no one because sometimes the best way to honour missing is to refuse it an audience.

The first Friday he came back like a sensible tide, late and warm from the car and smelling not of lemons but of whatever they put in hotel sheets to make you forget you have not slept. Abby claimed him on the steps with the triumph of a woman who has predicted something mundane and been proven right. Mr. Foyle saluted the bags as if luggage, too, needed acknowledging. Sherwood stood in the hallway with his hands in his pockets and the house offered up its familiar: the soft insult of the radiator, the plant doing a small impression of a man pretending to be healthy, the smudge on the wall from that time a box turned a corner badly. Mara came out of her kitchen with a tea towel over her shoulder and a face like someone who has already forgiven the next three days for not being longer. They cooked mushrooms with too much butter because the house seemed to ask for that sort of extravagance, and he told her the thing about the director’s scarf and the writer’s apology face and the way Saira had made a line land so gently he had wanted to applaud in a room where clapping would have been the wrong magnitude. She told him about a customer who had brought a book whose spine had given up near the name of the author and how it felt to make that name visible again. They went to bed with their mouths full of unremarkable words and slept as if the night had been waiting to be useful.

On a Monday he was learning a monologue facing a wall of Cardiff brick and on a Tuesday June rang with the particular cheerful panic of a beekeeper whose bees have decided that democracy is tiring. “They’ve gone and bundled themselves on the Pearsons’ pear tree,” she said. “Someone needs a ladder and someone else needs to talk to vertigo as if it were an aunt.” He looked at his schedule and at the piece of blue tape on the floor that was pretending to be another person’s foot and did the arithmetic of love and logistics. He couldn’t go. He rang Mara and said, “If you were minded to perform a public service with the assistance of a woman who has raised a man who refuses to listen, you would be my favourite in a new category,” and she said, “Tell June I am bringing biscuits, apologies, and Abby as ballast.”

They went in the afternoon and Sherwood, in a Cardiff interval, imagined them in that kitchen with the still life he knew—honey jars that caught the light, the tea towel that had learned the shape of June’s shoulder, the chair with the leg that needs moral support. He could see June’s patience in the way he could see his own hands move when he was in a scene that he had learned too well. Mara rang later and described it so he could have it in the correct order. “The bees were a polite riot,” she said. “Your mother is a diplomat. Abby burnt her finger on a biscuit and swore at a sovereign queen. The Pearsons will never again say your mother’s name without affection. I was allowed to hold something that made me feel like a responsible cloud.” He could hear June in the background telling someone off for breathing too loudly in the presence of insects, and he thought of the way the world keeps offering you parents when yours are busy.

Work found its stride and then mislaid it and then found it again, as work does. There was a coastal night where the wind made a religion of itself and the lights flattened everyone into ideas. Sherwood stood on a harbour wall and spoke a speech into a dark that would not give it back, and he could feel the cut of the stones through his boots and the cut of the line through his throat. Saira took her coat off between takes and put it on him without comment in the mean little window that keeps actors from saying heroic and stupid things about endurance. He thought about how heroism is mostly a person in a sensible scarf handing over a thing that keeps the cold off a moment too long. He went to bed in a room with a wall that knew how to hold old damp and woke to a text from Mara that said, The plant has new green in it where brown had been rehearsing, and it felt like a small, private superstition had paid out.

The letter came on a Thursday with a Gloucester postmark and a kind of weight that had nothing to do with paper. Mara put it on the table and put a cup on top of it as if to still anything it might become. She looked at the handwriting and did not name it and made three cups of tea she did not need and thought about the doors she had told him about, how some of them were soft if you pushed now, all these years after the closing. She wrote a list on the back of an envelope for the café without looking at it. At the bottom she wrote the word father because you have to meet some things on the page before you can meet them on the road. She took the cup off the letter and opened it and discovered it had been sent, as a kindness or as an apology, by her older brother: a notice about their father’s boiler being as stubborn as its owner and a quiet request to check if he had actually called the man with the van or had just insulted his answerphone. There was also a sentence about knees and a hint the winter had found them. She stood and stood some more and then put her apron on as if action could be elastic. She messaged Sherwood and he rang between cameras, and when she told him the shape of the day he did not say I’ll fix it or I’ll come in with a wrench and a programme of improvements. He said, “Do you want me to pick you up at eight,” and she said yes, and later, he did exactly that.

Gloucester at night was all the old familiar shapes softened by the compromises of sodium lights and time. Her father’s house had not made friends with symmetry, and the gate still had to be lifted at its hinge like a stubborn child. Len answered the door with a cough he pretended he had planned and a welcome he tried to bury under a comment about the cold. He looked at Sherwood in the appraising way that men of his generation look at other men, a survey that owes a little to the army even when the only uniform in question was school sports day. “You’re shorter,” he said, because fathers have the same instincts as boys in cafés. Sherwood bowed to it, because bows are older than pride. “They put me on boxes when a room demands respect,” he said, and Len laughed the grudging laugh of someone who cannot help but be pleased when a joke lands properly.

The boiler was in that place where houses hide miracles and leftovers, and together they stood in the cupboard that had poor opinions of both of them. Len had already sworn at it in a vocabulary inherited from shipbuilders and schoolteachers. Sherwood read the sticker that said Do Not and did a handful of the things that live a little to the side of Do Not and called a man who answered on the second ring with the weary decency of a tradesman who will save a life for a fee and a biscuit. Mara moved around her father’s kitchen with a way of touching nothing and everything at once, putting a pan on and taking it off, opening a cupboard to see if the contents might apologise for their arrangement. Len watched her because he loved her like someone pretending he had no more appointments to make in that direction. He watched Sherwood because the man had come after a day at work with a face that belonged to other people’s walls and because he held his hands like he had been taught to do nothing sometimes and that had unsettled Len in a good way.

They ate bacon at nine-thirty as if bacon had a job description that included late-night diplomacy. Len asked about Cardiff as if asking for a weather report and not a confession. Sherwood described a lad from props who could make a broken chair into a joke and a joke into a spare leg for the same chair, and Len nodded like this, finally, was a profession he could respect. He asked one question about being recognised with a tone that said he understood the problem of pride under a different name. Sherwood told him about a man at services who had decided to keep the queue sacred and about how moments like that are the furniture you sit on when the rest of the day is standing room only. Len grunted admiration, which was extravagant praise.

The conversation about the man with the kind voice did not happen the way Mara had rehearsed it in her head at fourteen, or at twenty-one, or in the years between when she had wondered if rehearsals were themselves a form of cowardice. It came sideways. Len passed her a plate and said, “I should have told him to bugger off when his tyres touched my curb,” and she looked at him over the bacon and almost dropped the whole decade in shock. “You told him what you tell everybody who parks too close to the lamppost,” she said. “That his antennae would ruin the aura of the street.” He rubbed his face with the palm of his hand in the way men apologise to themselves when the apology is only partly about the recipient. “I knew the voice was a liar,” he said. “He was polite with dents in it. I thought you’d see it. I thought I was allowed to call it interference if I named it love.” He met her eye and did not look away. “I am sorry for needing you to be a better judge of doors than I taught you to be,” he said. She put her forehead on his shoulder for three seconds, long enough to make an old man’s heart reorder itself, and then went to check the boiler again so nobody had to weep in Gloucester over a sandwich.

Sherwood slept on the sofa under a blanket that knew stories about grandchildren and waking up to cartoons. He woke when he heard Len move around the kitchen with the specific noises men of his age make when they think the house is deaf. He pretended to keep sleeping because there are griefs you do not eavesdrop, even in families you want to join. In the morning the boiler gave them warmth like reluctant apologies; the man with the van left them a receipt and a joke about colder winters. Len shook Sherwood’s hand with the dignity of a general releasing a soldier back to the front and told him he could come again and be mocked for his height anytime he fancied. Mara kissed her father on the cheek with authority and texted her brother a report with the facts and the minimum adjectives, and on the drive back she did not cry so much as breathe differently. He put his hand on the back of her neck when they stopped at lights and she tilted her head into it like a plant finding a better window. It felt like a pact not to be good, exactly, but to be honest in a way that made goodness easier later.

Snow threatened once and then performed. Cardiff made a myth of it when flakes started finding the camera lenses quicker than the focus could, and production became a dance between ambition and gritting. The city went quiet in the way cities do when whiteness makes people speak softer to each other. Cheltenham took its turn a day later. Sherwood left after lunchtime and drove into the sort of light that makes fools of experienced drivers. Just past the roundabout where the road thinks it is a narrative device, he slid slightly in a way that was not theatrical but would make a man go slowly for the next hour to honour the moment. Near the Promenade his car sulked at a kerb like a teenager and refused to be coaxed. Dale appeared with the exact walk of someone who knows how to push without making a show of it, and together, with the help of a man in a hat that should have come with lanolin and a laughing woman in a coat that declared mountains unfazed, they persuaded the car to behave. Abby watched from the steps with a cigarette like a conductor, her dog in a knitted hood that made the creature look like a minor bishop. When he was parked he stood a second to let his breath catch up and then took his three lemons out of the passenger seat with a care that would have looked absurd to anyone not in on the joke.

Mara had candles ready because she always had matches and because she enjoyed the small lie of flame pretending to be heat. The house made that low, proud sound radiators make when they decide to try without the incentive of certainty. They lit two candles because one was melodrama and three was waste, and the room did that trick it had learned of making itself listen. He told her the whole route as if geography had been recalibrated just for him; she told him that the plant had not given up even a theatrically dead leaf to the floor and that Mr. Foyle had invented for himself a new job: being the person who checked on people who would never ask to be checked on. “He knocked on my door,” she said, laughing. “He asked me if I was the sort to fall over in snow and I said I was the sort to fall over in sunshine if it felt lately like a good idea, and he told me to leave the clumsy to him. He looked very pleased with his portfolio.”

The papers tried another headline because their job is to try. A photograph showed a man with a hood and the caption made a guess about who the woman beside him might be. The guess was wrong before it was rude, and then it grew the sort of comments that people write when the day has been the wrong size and the internet looks like a place where oversized emotions can find furniture. Saskia rung with her professional calm and said, “We are bored. The boredom will win. Do not feed anyone.” He did not, which felt like a virtue because he had not always been good at not touching the thing that hurts. Abby, operating on an older set of rules, wrote on the coffee shop chalkboard: We are out of scandal and will be for some time; spare napkins available, and the man with the camera who had learned Abby’s hours chose another town where people had more energy for foolishness.

Arthur advanced down a pavement with his Zimmer in the way all men advance down a pavement when something they hate is the device that lets them do it. He took two small buns from Dale with exaggerated suspicion, and Dale stood with his shoulders in a new place, less like a punishment, more like a habit. Claire pointed at the new rail and told her father to love it like it was his third child, and he told it to stop smirking because it was making the hallway look cheap. Mr. Foyle developed a phrase he used on strangers who threatened to tell him about his trolley. “It’s a metaphor,” he would say, gravely, and walk on at a speed that made the metaphor obvious. The square learned to balance small dramas on its edges and let the centre be resilient.

Cardiff pressed on. There was a scene in a house that had been rented by production from a woman who did reflexology and kept stones on her windowsill for the moral improvement of passersby. There was a morning when a sparrow flew into the kitchen set and everyone halted their expertise to execute the one thing everyone knows how to do, which is to open two doors and shepherd a heart back to where it usually lives. Sherwood found that he could make his mouth go soft over a line that formerly had been a clenched thing. He found that the sound department ran their empire with sweets and kindness and a tyranny of gaffer tape, and he was happy to be subject to their laws. He did the laundrette scene again with the rewrite that let him smile without betraying the man, and when the director said “There,” with that controlled warmth of someone who has seen a thing they hoped for turn up on time, he texted Mara a single word: There. She replied with two: I heard.

They started doing the thing couples do when their histories are not similar and their days cannot be the same: they lent each other small certainties. He lent her the certainty that a line said well rescues a scene even if the plot was being obstinate. She lent him the certainty that glue dries and spines hold and that the long throw of patience is sometimes a better stunt than anything that explodes. They kept proving they knew how to be quiet. He sat at her table while she stitched and he said nothing because the sound of her thread through cloth was a sentence in its own right. She lay on his sofa while he learnt lines and watched his face frown and frown less, and she said nothing because the way he put his tongue to his teeth when he stopped himself from overacting was its own comedy.

The plant, which used to take every opportunity to audition for tragedy, settled into being a citizen. It put out leaf after leaf with the determination of a list-maker crossing off the existence of each new day. Abby gave them another plant just because she couldn’t help herself—something ferny that looked like a gossip—and they set it near the radiator and it went on as if heat was a concept it intended to exploit. Mara put a saucer under each and declared herself their bureaucrat. He told them both, twice, not to embarrass him, and he had the odd sensation of being obeyed not because he was loud but because he had learned to ask correctly.

On a Wednesday that smelled like metal because the sky could not get warm, he watched a man come into Atkinson’s with a camera held like a phone and saw the way Mara’s mouth arranged itself into that particular line that has stopped worse than photographs. He did not go over because he had learned not to fight battles you win by ignoring. He watched Abby stand and deploy her cigarette like a sceptre and say a sentence in which the word public was used correctly and charmingly. He watched the man choose to leave because the thing about towns is that they have memory and hierarchy, and Abby’s happiness is one of the chief gods. He went home and kissed Mara in the kitchen because he had learned that kissing is better when it is about something that has just happened and been well-solved than when it is about nothing at all.

His father arrived in a memory one night uninvited and gracious. In a hotel room that hummed with other people’s televisions, Sherwood sat at the small desk and took a screwdriver out of his bag because the bedside lamp had been wobbling for three days and the wobble had begun to feel existential. He tightened the screw and he heard Hal Lake’s voice, fond and unpersuasive, say, Think first, touch once. He told him he had, that he was not touching everything anymore, that he had learned to keep his hands in his pockets even when everything in him wanted to fix by making. He said it out loud, and he said it again because the sentiment has hands: it wants to be in the air as well as in your head. He slept afterward, and the lamp did not wobble.

On Sundays, when Cardiff didn’t need him and the square had put out its ordinary for inspection, he and Mara walked to the Pump Room because tradition had to be improved by repetition. They took flasks because there is something credibly romantic about drinking tea out of a vessel that pretends to be military. They sat and watched children in too-thin coats perform cartwheels with a heroic misunderstanding of frost. They watched a man carry a cake like a crown and a woman laugh like a kettle being lifted at exactly the right moment. He told her once, shy as a boy in front of a tooth, that he loved her, and it came out not like a proclamation but like an instruction to a plant: stay. She said it back from the part of her mouth that keeps vows, and nothing in the street changed colour or sang, which was a relief. A bus sighed to a stop. Mr. Foyle debated swans. The world took note the way the world always takes note—by making it slightly easier to open a difficult jar later, by letting a song you didn’t know you knew begin in your throat while you were waiting for a green light.

There were days when the separation snapped at them for sport. He would be on a set where everyone else was laughing at a joke about a piece of gear that had a name like a cartoon, and he would feel the isolation that comes when your laughter is borrowed from a room you are not in. She would be behind the counter at five with a queue that looked like a plea and she would think about his shoulders for no good reason and wish a different pair of hands were carrying mugs. They told each other these moments because the dignity of not complaining is over-rated in intimacy. He did not make a saint of her patience, and she did not glorify his endurance. They agreed, without saying it as a treaty, that the days which were hard would not be stored as debt.

Near the end of the month, a man came into the bookshop with a family Bible whose spine had grown tired near the beatitudes. He put it on the table with a care that suggested he understood the politics of the object and said, “It has lived under my shirt since my mum died. I think it would like to sit upright again.” Mara touched the leather like a blessing and said, “I can make it stand and read,” and then, because the man looked like a person who had been forgiven by too few sentences lately, she added, “You are doing a very reasonable thing.” Later, she told Sherwood about the way the letters on the flyleaf had deepened because fingers had placed themselves there for years, and he told her about a prop man who had made him cry by adjusting a picture frame on a fake mantel with the reverence of someone reintroducing a country to its own border. They laughed at themselves for being brought to their knees by objects and carried on anyway.

The card from Ward 4 stayed on the fridge even after Arthur had stopped answering to hospital clocks, because there is a tradition in keeping old maps even when the road is fixed. The bees slept and woke as bees do. June left a voicemail that said she was learning to like winter because it was like a meeting in which everyone has been told to speak clearly and no one did. Saskia sent an email with a schedule attached and something that sounded like apology in the subject line that just said Timing. Owen rang from a taxi and told Sherwood that for once the notes were better not worse and to enjoy that rare meteorological event. Abby brought round a cake with sugar like snow and said, “I bought it,” and dared anyone to question the honesty of the declaration. Dale asked if anyone knew when the council put salt down and then ended up doing it himself with a plastic tub and an old broom because some questions are only asked to find out if you are the answer.

On the last evening before a run of nights in Cardiff, they sat at his table and ate something stew-like that had more ambition than talent. The candle did its modest work. The plant behaved. He told her he would be gone five days in a row and she said, “I will fold the hours and put them on the shelf and take them down one by one,” and he said, “I will send you the sound of a sea pretending to be theatre,” and she said, “Send me the laugh you make when Saira undercuts you,” and he said yes. They stood at the window not to look out at anything particular but to see their own reflection, the trick city glass does when it allows you to believe you are both inside and outside without having to pick. He put his hand on the pane and hers on top of his and the chill communicated itself in honest speech. He kissed her and felt the kind of quiet afterwards that is the opposite of silence. The street did its evening inventory of sounds: cutlery, a bicycle chain, the low speech of two people arguing about something too small for days but vital for hours. He said later and she said later and neither of them meant the word like a delay. They meant it like a place they would meet.Chapter 10

Nights in Cardiff taught his bones a different grammar. Time became a sequence of blue hours with a seam of orange at the edge, and he learned to speak in whispers to people whose jobs were loud in daylight. The docks made their own weather. Metal sang quietly when the wind got into it, ropes talked to one another, and the sea did that magnificent indifference which any sane person should envy. He stood on concrete that remembered ships and said lines that had been rewritten at half past three, the ink hardly dry, and listened as Saira adjusted a word here, an inhale there, until the scene stopped sounding like ambition and began to sound like people. He drove home in the morning with coffee like penance and the sky offering him a pale coin he could spend on an hour of sleep. He got used to placing his key in his door with a care that made his neighbours think burglars had taken a vow of gentleness.

Mara’s days were still obedient to clocks that respected sunlight. She worked the counter with the kind face you need to ration. She wrote names on cups as if names were a way of stabilising liquids. In the afternoons she bound spines that had survived the interior weather of decades. Glue had moods, and she had learned them the way you learn another person: which patience yields, which pressure snaps, which warmth persuades. She played the piano in slices, not to practise, not quite to perform, but like a woman speaking a language she didn’t want to forget. There were evenings she fell asleep with her hands curved in that shape music gives them, and woke to find her fingers remembering a chord before her head remembered her name.

They found a way to leave each other messages that were less like postcards and more like tools. He sent her the short video of the foghorn singing the harbour awake and she sent him, in return, the sound of a kettle on the boil and a muttered, “Stay,” as if instructing heat to mind its manners. He wrote her once from a break room smelling of plywood and triumph, told her about a grip named Kev who kept a lucky coin taped inside his van, and she replied with the story of a woman who had brought in a book she had inherited from a grandmother and asked whether it was possible to mend the part where the grandmother’s hand had gone. “Sometimes,” Mara wrote, “the page will take a thumbprint like a blessing. You can’t repair that. You shouldn’t. All I can do is make sure the book doesn’t pretend nothing happened.”

On a Thursday that was pretending to be a Wednesday, Abby decided to drag the square to democracy. She had circled a notice with such firm ink that the paper beneath had nearly learned a groove: Residents’ meeting, pavement safety and delivery protocol. “If they are going to ask for opinions,” she told the dog, who blinked as if consenting, “we must bring them ours in a basket.” She collared Sherwood between Bristol and Cardiff with an efficiency that would have done the fire service proud. “You come,” she said, jabbing a finger at the space near his chest that always made him want to salute. “You can sit at the back and practise humility and then, when they say something absurd about human behaviour, you can stand up and do that voice that makes people think they should try harder.”

He went because he had run out of reasons not to be a citizen and because Mara wrote on a scrap of paper, Meeting, seven, bring common sense, and threaded it through his fingers like a ribbon. The hall smelled of old wood and new resolution. A councillor with a smile he had polished against mornings stood at the front and thanked everyone for the enormous honour of their presence as if inaugurating a bridge the river had not asked for. The van man from the day of Arthur’s fall sat by the door with his cap in his hands and dignity like a bruise. Dale took a seat against the wall and looked at the floor in the way of boys learning how to seem less trouble than they feel. Mr. Foyle arranged himself in a chair and glowered benevolently at anyone whose trousers suggested they might vote against common decency. Claire stood with a notebook and the kind of calm that makes men who have never met her behave better for fear of having to explain why they didn’t.

Mara kept her hands in her lap, because hands have been known to interrupt when the mouth is doing the brave thing. She spoke once, plainly, about sightlines and speed. She did not mention the man with the kind voice or the doors that closed behind you, because this was a meeting about the outside of things and the inside would have to wait. Sherwood stayed at the back like a conscience that had learned to whisper. He watched the way the room decided, in small gusts, to be kind, and then watched it flirt with meanness because people, when gathered, can’t resist it. When the councillor said, gently and smugly, that signs were being considered, as if signs had been the neglected weapon all along, he stood without really meaning to and heard his own voice behave sensibly.

“I’m not here to be a performance,” he said, and his mouth did not try to be charming about it, which felt like progress. “I’m here because a man fell down and another man couldn’t stop his wheels in time and a third man parked like a thought he hadn’t finished. You can write a rule and bolt a sign to a pole, and we should, but the thing that keeps a body upright in the end is a habit of mind. It’s the bit where you imagine someone’s grandfather stepping off a kerb before you do the easy thing with your ankle and your accelerator. It’s that, and a line of paint that says not here. I want the paint. But mostly I want the practice.”

There was a small silence that wasn’t reluctant; it was the kind of pause keener to agree than to argue. The councillor blinked and did the arithmetic of applause against time, then smiled the smile of a man who has remembered he is against villains in public. Abby made a low approving sound as if someone had put a good pastry on a plate. Afterwards, in the tidy chaos of folding chairs, a woman in a yellow hat came to Mara and said, “Your letter about long sentences—it made me lick my pencil and write properly to my nephew about his motorcycle.” Mara thanked her as if given fruit out of season. Dale touched Sherwood’s sleeve with the courage of someone learning how not to flinch. “Paint,” he said. “I can help lay it. I don’t mind being the part of the solution that makes your shoes messy.”

Cardiff’s schedule arrived with its usual lack of empathy and a column of numbers that looked like a poem about endurance. The BBC, in its expansive way, suggested a profile to tie into the series launch, a gentle piece with a photographer who understood about shadows and asked permission out loud. Saskia, whose cynicism had been baptised in the river of previous disasters, said, “This could be useful if we make it local. If we don’t go to London and sit you on a chair that looks expensive in a room that pretends expense is a virtue. We can do it in Cheltenham if you want. In a place that isn’t your home but smells enough like you for the picture to be honest.”

He had learned to mistrust honesty when it arrived with garnish, but there was a plea hidden in the suggestion that he had not anticipated: the chance to choose a setting where the light would be kind to a woman whose hands stitched spines for a living. He and Mara talked about it on the floor because the chairs were crowded with fabric and because the floor, plain and true, asked less. He said, “We could go to the Pump Room. Or to the bench where Arthur has argued pigeons into moral improvement. I could be photographed as evidence that expected people walk ordinary paths.” She considered the way a woman does when she is counting not just outcomes but costs. “You don’t owe them our geography,” she said. “But if you want to domesticate the headline, we can take it somewhere with wind and a railing. I’ll be the woman in the background with ink on her hands, the one who looks like a comma in your sentence.”

They did it on a cold morning that made everyone’s breath visible, as if truth were a weather. The photographer was, to their relief, the sort of person who apologised to benches when he put his bag down. He took pictures of Sherwood leaning in a way that did not look like leaning had been suggested, his face not arranged into the expressions his agents liked to harvest. He took one, in a moment that felt neither staged nor stolen, of Sherwood talking to Mr. Foyle with the patience you can’t fake when you don’t know the man. He took one of Mara’s hands when she forgot herself and reached to re-tie a scarf too loose on his neck, the light catching glue in the creases like a tiny frost. He promised he would not show her face without her permission, and then, without prompting, kept the promise by not taking the picture in the first place. When the piece went live, a week later, it used words like rooted and gentle without making them sound like consolation prizes. It mentioned a square where people sat on purpose and a piano that had opinions. It did not mention a woman’s name. The photograph the paper chose for the banner was the railing and a horizon that was counterfeit because it belonged to a municipal body of water, and he felt grateful to a magazine for once like a man whose shoe has been returned with the stone removed.

They had their first argument that week not because of the piece but because of the way it refused to flatter. He had been asked, at the end of a long day, if he wanted to “name” the person who made distance survivable. He had said no with the automatic caution of someone who has learned to keep anything tender unphotographed. He told Mara about it later, expecting a nod, expecting relief, and she nodded, because she had practice at that, and then said, after a beat that asked him to be braver with his ear, “I don’t want to be named so you can calm down a headline. But I also don’t want to be the part of your life that is always inked out like a curse word. It’s not about the public. It’s about the way you talk in rooms to people with pens. Will you ever say a sentence where I exist as if I were ordinary.”

He felt the old muscle kick, the one that reaches for defense and a smile. He stopped it with an effort that left his shoulders honest. “I have been practising keeping,” he said. “And sometimes I forget holding and hiding aren’t synonyms. I don’t want to keep you like a secret because I am ashamed. I want to keep you like a warmth because I am greedy. That’s the wrong version. I hear it. I am adjusting.”

She did not reward him for the speech with a kiss or a resolution. She fixed a button on his cuff that had been threatening to become narrative, and then she said, “Say my name to someone who won’t make money from it. Do it because I need to hear your mouth not skip where I should be. We can start small. You can call your mother.”

He rang June in the kitchen where the lemon candle had, miraculously, become a habit instead of a cry for help. He told her he was happy, and he said Mara’s name with the exact gravity he used when apologising to plants. June, who had been ready to love any person who had taught her son to sleep at the right hours and eat things that resembled food, said, “I know,” like the kindly omniscient she was, and then, because she is from a county that doesn’t waste declarations on days that don’t need them, asked whether the plant had outgrown its first pot yet and whether he planned to act on this knowledge or anthropomorphise it into staying small.

The square acquired a piece of painted line, not a thick one, not the sort of stripe you could put a boast on, but a line with confidence, poured in cold weather by Dale and two men who liked to be told precisely how far paint was allowed to travel. The council published a leaflet with a photo of the zebra crossing that had been there since nineteen-eighty-two as if they had invented it that morning. People obeyed because enough of their neighbours had watched the process of paint becoming law, and there is no rule quite as binding as the one you saw your friend make. Arthur dedicated the line to the preservation of knees. He stepped across it each morning with an exaggerated caution that he called theatre and everyone else called affection.

Dale signed up for a first aid course he found pinned to the notice board of a church that had given up on hell and gone big on biscuits. He held the booklet as if it might try to fly out of his hands. He told Sherwood, with a degree of bravado that didn’t quite cover the tenderness behind it, that he was learning where ribs were meant to be and how to persuade a heart to remember its job. “If anyone falls over again,” he said, “I’ll have more to bring than sorry.” He didn’t bring it up as a penance, and no one received it like one. Mr. Foyle shook his hand with an old soldier’s mild pride. Claire told him where the good biscuits were kept at the back of the hall. Abby said, “Look at you, useful,” with a kindness that was almost rude in its insistence, and the dog licked his knuckles in the way dogs do when they have forgiven a person for being human and want it on the record.

Work sent him to a street in Cardiff that had been made to look like the nineteen-nineties with more effort than the nineteen-nineties ever required. He wore a coat that had opinions about lapels and walked through a take where rain, real and sourced, made every surface admit its sins. The writer, who had been sorry in advance for so many things he had finally run out of apologies, came and stood beside him between takes and said, “You’re doing something I only ever believe when I see it. You are letting the line land and then not apologising for it landing.” He wanted to tell the man that he had been practising this on a square with a woman who fixed spines, but instead he squeezed his own hand in his pocket in a ridiculous, private way and promised himself a cup of tea that would not deserve a second attempt at sweetening.

If there was a photograph to cause trouble, it came not from the profile day but from a bus stop when nobody was thinking about theatre. He and Mara were going nowhere special, the weather undecided and the day pleasantly without narrative. He stood with his hands in his pockets because his fingers were cold and because there was nothing to hold until the bus arrived. She leaned her shoulder against his arm in the way you lean when it doesn’t matter if the person beneath you moves. Someone across the road took a picture with a phone that made an artificial click to announce what it had done, as if guilt had a sound effect. The photograph was poor by any standard, a study in elbows and poor focus, but it had the two of them in it and that was enough for the machine that makes headlines. The caption made a guess that was in the right county and then took a train to the wrong town. Abby brought the paper round with a noise like a kettle interrupted and presented it to them as if it were a flaming dessert they had not ordered.

They didn’t panic. They put the paper on the table, and the plant liberally ignored it. He wrote to Saskia before she could ring and did not wait for a blessing. He said, “I won’t deny what doesn’t need denying. If they call, I will say a sentence that is not for burning.” Saskia, who had coached men through worse self-sabotages and better, sent back a reluctant coronation: Fine. Say it like a person who has learned a better trick than coyness. He did for once as promised. When a freelancer with a voice he recognised from previous kindnesses rang and asked whether there was anything he wanted to say to the picture, he said, “There’s a woman I love who ties broken books back to themselves and is teaching me to talk to plants. I’m learning to keep what is mine without pretending it isn’t there.” The paper printed it without irony because the sentence had the shape of a door closing gently rather than a gate slamming. The comments were what comments are. The square read it and brought lemons to the step as if participating in a ritual that would keep the gods of attention sleepy.

There were days when the noise found them anyway. A man in a long coat with too clean a haircut turned up outside Atkinson’s with a microphone, flanked by someone whose job title would never be uttered in full in polite conversation. He asked passersby if they thought famous men had the right to stand at bus stops unbeautiful. Abby lit a cigarette with the solemnity of a high priestess and said, “No interviews on a street where we have to put salt down,” and the cameraman, who had spent enough time in towns to recognise where true power lives, turned the lens on his shoes and pretended to be dusting it. Mara stacked cups slowly because cup-stacking is a quiet refusal and quiet refusals have been known to yield results. The man went away because it turns out there are episodes of human decency you can’t cancel.

Len came to Cheltenham the week the frost made the railings handsome. He arrived at the square in a coat that had seen history and the wrong kind of rain, and he stood in Sherwood’s hallway with the look of a man who has agreed to an experiment and secretly expects to be impressed. He brought with him a box of screws and a screwdriver because he believed the world could be improved at the edges by a man with time. He fixed the hinge on the kitchen cupboard that had been muttering about injustice since September. He lowered the squeak of a board on the stairs to an acceptable level. He told the plant that it could stop making a martyr of itself; the plant, worryingly susceptible to male voices with Gloucestershire consonants, put out a leaf. They ate something with potatoes because Len refused to recognise dinner without them, and he asked soft questions about Cardiff and harder ones about money as if he could ward off the day his daughter might forget what pounds weigh. He said Mara’s name twice in a way that made it an acceptable sound in an old man’s mouth. He shook Sherwood’s hand at the end of the night and held on a fraction too long, and in the extra second he seemed to pass over a ledger and a pencil and the permission to fill both without a supervisor.

The bee news in January was brief and perverse. June rang to tell them that one of the colonies had decided to move from the posh accommodation to the rougher one because bees distrust luxury as a rule and prefer wind with their breakfast. “They’ve made a point,” she said, immoderately pleased by the evidence of an insect’s principles. “If only all politicians were small and furred and patterned against complacency.” She sent a jar the colour of afternoons to the square with a note that read: Winter honey, to be deployed on toast or on arguments. Mara put it on a top shelf as if to tell the house they were currently in good weather.

The first proper rehearsal of the laundrette scene in situ brought him a surprise that felt like déjà vu and design. Saira was late by five minutes, which for Saira amounted to a scandal. When she arrived, breath visible and hair unnegotiated, she said, “I went by the shop of the woman you won’t stop talking about without talking about,” and he blinked like somebody woken by a gentle fire alarm. “I bought a book that had given up the ghost and she offered to let me watch while she coaxed it into remembering one.” She described the arc of the needle and the calm of the voice and the way Mara said things like, “Paper wants to be forgiven. Most things do.” Saira’s expression, which had eaten cynicism for breakfast many mornings and still maintained a healthy appetite, softened into something else. “It’s good,” she said, almost grudging, and he hid his odd feeling of possession under a respectable beam of pride.

He discovered, in the middle of those good days, that happiness still had the power to frighten him when viewed from certain angles. It looked like a banister he trusted not to splinter and he had been the kind of boy who knew some woods still give you splinters even if you are careful. He told her this once, a late night in his kitchen when the candle had not been lit because they were finally warm without pretending. He said, “I am sometimes still braced for the bit where the joke turns and the punchline is hunger,” and she said, “Then take another piece of bread,” and put the jam on it like a benediction. They practised these small sacraments until they looked like habits.

It would have been satisfying if the plant had waited for a declared act to perform its own. It did not. It chose an ordinary morning with a leaking sky to produce a flower so small it did not, strictly speaking, deserve the category. It was pale, indecisive, the sort of bloom that might have been mislabelled in a catalogue. He noticed it when he went to put the kettle on and called out in a tone he had last used to announce early snow to a sleeping house when he was a child. She came in, eyes sleepy and hair unedited, and looked as if someone had improved a painting when they were not watching. “It’s showing off,” she said, generous about the plant’s pride. They stood over it for far too long, two grown people bent in reverence to a thing that had been nursed out of sulk and into effort. The kettle clicked off without drama. The street beyond the window pulled itself on like a jumper. They poured tea and sat and left the plant to get on with its day.

On a weekend that Doug in Props declared lucky on account of an accident with a measuring tape that had not drawn blood, Owen drove west and discovered that Abby’s coffee was better than his own personality. He came bearing biscuits and a schedule, trying out charm on a town that had not granted London a full lease in a decade. He looked at Sherwood in a way that managers do when they are trying to assess the stability of happiness as if it were a set wall on casters. He found Mara behind the counter and flapped, temporarily, out of his depth, then recovered because you do not survive agents’ meetings in rooms above restaurants without learning to adjust. He said, “We have script changes to audition your patience and a premiere date that believes it is an event and we need to talk about suits,” and Mara, who had dealt with worse tyrants in the form of pastry that refuses to flake and customers who ask the impossible of milk, nodded and handed him a coffee with just enough sugar to persuade him the world was solvable for two hours.

The word premiere made Sherwood’s teeth set like a man waiting for a photograph that took too long to expose. He pictured rooms lit for abandon and performed spontaneity. He pictured champagne as a prop and people who would ask questions with a tone that implied he was late to a party where his presence had already been criticised. He said, “My suit can be made out of a decent apology and a promise to go home by eleven,” and Owen said, “The apology we can manage. The promise you will break if a director talks to you like a father, so I am scheduling you a taxi.” He mentioned, in a way that tried to sound cooler than it was, that there had been a call from a magazine that used to matter and now mattered again, wanting to do a cover with “British men who have learned to look like they feel.” Sherwood said no in four parts, including the part where he offered a good friend with stronger cheekbones and fewer reasons to refuse, and Owen, whose job had once been to coax him in the direction of noise, found himself relieved by the refusal in a way that threatened his professional identity.

The day of the premiere arrived like a stagehand who has learned to be invisible and likes to startle actors anyway. The suit fit in the way a sensible decision fits: boring in photographs, warm in weather. Mara wrote him three sentences on a piece of paper and put it in his inside pocket without telling him what they were. At the door he put his hand on the pocket like a man checking a passport. He walked through light thrown up by moths who had studied economics. He answered questions in complete sentences and did not blink in a way a tabloid could turn into a diagnosis. He did the strand of interviews that come at you like small weather fronts and he survived by remembering that a woman at a bus stop had leaned into his arm not for audience but because muscles get tired. When he felt the fatigue rise in his throat like a well, he put two fingers into his pocket and touched paper. He did not take it out. The touch was enough. Later, in the car that contained a silence as useful as any toy, he read the three sentences out loud to himself: You are not a glass. Breathe after a question mark. Come home earlier than you promised.

When he came in, the house was not making an effort for him, which was the point. There was a cup on the counter and a plate with a heel of bread and a knife that had learned its job by doing it. She was barefoot because carpet makes shoes feel like lying. She looked at him in the way you look at people who have come back with most of themselves intact and a piece missing they can put down without fuss. He told her two jokes that had been told in the wrong place by men who should know better and one moment where a young actor had been turned into meat by an old cameraman’s compliment and had smiled anyway, and she did not give him the tidy reaction, the outrage that would have let him keep the night at a distance. She said, “Good. And we’ll go again, and we’ll stop when we want to,” and made him tea that tasted like reward and not sedative.

Arthur decided to write a letter to the Echo about the rail. He drafted it out loud in the square with a donkey stubbornness that made Dale grin. He said, “Dear Sirs and Madams, if you will not come and observe my specifications in situ you will find yourselves surrounded by pigeons of ill-repute.” Claire took the pen because handwriting tells the truth whatever the sentences claim. She put on the paper a tone that would have passed for mild if you didn’t know her. “It will be printed Tuesday,” she said, certain of the alchemy. “They need a letter that shouts without raising its voice. It will be yours.” He puffed with the self-satisfaction of a man who has poured scorn on a system and been applauded for it in the proper channels.

It rained for a week straight after, that fine rain that gets into thoughts and furniture. The square learned to be an aquarium. People moved slower not because of danger but out of respect for the project water had undertaken. He and Mara invented new soups as if they could feed the sky its mood back to it and calm it by acknowledgement. She put on a record that had too much crackle to be fiction and played along for a bar here and there, creating harmony where an old scratch insisted on repetition. He walked the room practising lines that were less about words and more about temperature. Sometimes they didn’t speak for an hour and learned, again, that silence can be a useful instrument providing the person holding it knows where to rest their hands.

One morning, with the rain pretending to have retired, the square provided him with Mr. Foyle’s past without ceremony. A man in a coat not built for English wet walked into the green as if he owned it and stood overly straight as if reminded of inspection. Foyle looked up, eyes now good at narrowing for reasons other than suspicion, and said a name that you don’t usually say outside of a room with a flag. The man smiled with the politeness that always hides at least a sadness and replied with a nickname that made Foyle sixteen for one second. They shook hands like old men who have forgiven entire continents on Sundays and withheld it on Mondays. The stranger had a photograph folded too safely to be anything other than important. Foyle refused to open it at first, superstition being one of his prized possessions. Later, on the bench, he showed Sherwood without looking at the picture himself. It was a troop on a hill you could have mistaken for any hill, faces set in that particular hilarity of the almost-hard. “We were good at being told to live,” Foyle said, his voice a new instrument. “I am trying to learn to be told nothing.” It occurred to Sherwood that the square was full of people sitting in their own drills and that happiness in towns like this is often an ungeneraled miracle.

The script delivered a scene that resisted him because it was about a boy apologising badly, and he found it hard to be poor at contrition on purpose. He took it to Mara like a broken appliance and asked her to listen for the hum that meant useful. She stood at the sink washing a cup with that righteous determination he had learned to fear and adore, and said, “You’re placing the apology like a performance. Put it down like you don’t expect anyone to clap. Try telling the title of the regret before you tell the story.” He tried it, embarrassed by the simple instruction and the way it improved everything. Later, in the room where concrete tasted like damp, he said the line without leaning on it and it fell true. The director made her little weather change of a smile. Saira squeezed his arm once in an actor’s version of Let’s Not Make a Big Deal but This Was a Nice Thing. He texted Mara, You are a menace to poor acting, and she responded, Glad to be of public service, and added a picture of the plant being as reasonable as any living thing can be in January.

He began to count the ways the town had taught him not drama but scope. He could list them—paint and pigeons and men with modest tools—but the list itself felt like a kind of theft, as if naming the ways you have been educated turns them into a product. He kept the list anyway, in a mental pocket with the paper where she had written instructions for survival. He walked to the Pump Room on days when his body needed persuading. He let himself be watched by the water because water knows how to regard without appetite. He fed squirrels once just to see if Arthur would ruin the afternoon and Arthur did, magnificently, with a lecture on bread’s treachery that made a child laugh and a mother forgive a man in a cap for frightening the pigeons on purpose.

By February, the world began to extend to him invitations as if he had proven he could return them with decisions attached. A school wrote to ask if he would come and talk to fifteen-year-olds about the scandal of being from a place and leaving it. He said yes because he had been a boy who could not get his voice up to the front of the room and thought perhaps he could carry it for someone else. He stood in a gym where markings pretended rules existed and faced faces at the hungry end of possibility. He told them nothing that could be turned into a poster, and still a poster manufacturer would have found a way. He said, “You can fail at the right times and it will not kill you. You can be kind to a person whose job you want and it won’t subtract from your luck.” He mentioned that you don’t have to move to find a plot. He mentioned leaving anyway. He didn’t say the word love because teenagers are allergic to it when it isn’t theirs, but he said plant twice and the boys laughed. A girl with a plait that came to a disciplined point asked him whether fame was a gate or a fence and he told her the boring truth: it depends on the day, and on whether you came alone. He went home with a drawing in a spiralbound notebook of his face looking more like a fox than a man, and he pinned it on his wall and took it down and pinned it again three times before deciding the wall could survive it.

The first thaw arrived as a cautious conference. Snow withdrew in corners. Pavements exhaled. The rail looked less valiant and more like furniture again. Claude Debussy’s name appeared on the piano because Mara had decided one evening to make peace with him, and she did, on the strict understanding that he would not monopolise her. She made a cake three times until it stopped being a lesson and became a cake. He learnt the streets between Cardiff and home so exactly he could have described the sound they made to someone in the dark. He learned the names of technicians he had previously been too frightened to talk to because he thought their skill was a kind of secret club and learned that the club was very boring and mostly concerned with Allen keys. He said sorry to his mother for forgetting a bin day, and June told him to stop apologising about things that could be solved by a broom. He kissed Mara on a step in public because they had decided not to orient themselves by cowardice anymore, and a man smiled and pretended to look away, and the dog sneezed like punctuation, and the town liked them enough to be bored by them, which was more blessing than fame has ever been.

One evening, when the day had settled like a shawl and the candles were unlit by design, he held the script in his left hand and her wrist with his right, not to keep her but to appreciate the place where bone meets decision. “We’ll have ugly days,” he said, as if reading a stage direction. “Something will go wrong and it will not be the thing we rehearsed for. I am saying it out loud so it cannot consider itself a surprise and therefore a coup.” She nodded, and her mouth made the shape of agreement and also of being amused by someone who thinks naming a wolf alters its appetite. “We will,” she said. “And we’ll put the bad plates at the back of the cupboard and use them last and complain about them together. And, on those days, use more salt.”

The next week Cardiff tried to hail him like a taxi and he raised a hand. The production had Three Important Days, capitalised by everyone out of a desire for rigour, and he kept his mouth properly disciplined around vowels that wanted to wobble and consonants that thought they deserved awards. He “nailed” things, a verb he refused to use but understood the relief of. He recognised the sound in the room when a scene had stopped being an argument and become a compromise people were proud of. He sent Mara a late-night picture of a light reflected in a puddle and she sent back a photograph of bees asleep in a way that looked like a conspiracy and also like rest. He fell into bed at a hotel that kept the heat at a temperature preferred by lizards and dreamed about doors that were neither soft nor hard but reasonable, the kind you can close with two fingers and open with a shoulder if you’ve too many groceries.

When he came home after those days, the plant had thrown another ridiculous flower and the lemons were, as ever, a joke that kept passing its exam. He picked up a paper at the door and found inside Arthur’s letter printed in full, uncut, deliciously pompous. The headline was the sort of thing a sub-editor writes to make himself feel like a poet at four minutes to press, and he forgave it. Arthur had found the tone that maneuvers righteousness into a handshake. By the kettle was a postcard with a picture of a beach no one should swim from in winter. On the back, in a hand he could have recognised in darkness, it said: Later is working. Come eat cake. Bring your face.

He brought his face. He brought his hands too, and they behaved. The cake was a better version than the three that had trained it into goodness. Abby appeared because she had rightly decided that cakes do not adhere to property lines. Mr. Foyle took a piece in a way that suggested taxation. Claire knocked and delivered a jar of something she had been given by a nurse who had surrendered to gratitude. Dale came with salt on his shoes from the morning’s training on ice that had threatened to be legacy. June rang and left a message that was only a laugh, spoiled at the end by love. The square held them, in that invisible way places do not call attention to because attention ruins their trick. They sat and ate and argued about whether benches should be salted and whether pigeons were better in moderation or exile. He watched Mara put her plate down when she was done and looked at the space she made for it and thought, without a single theatre curtain unfurling, that a life built out of regular decisions might be better than any plot the cleverest writer could contrive.

Later, when evening let itself into the room gently, he said the careless sentence he had promised once he would risk. He did not make it into a performance. He did not lean on a word as if asking it to take more of his weight than language safely can. He said, simply, that he wanted to keep going, that the going itself felt like proof and not delay, that he loved her in the way the plant had learned: by staying and not by flowering on schedule. She did not applaud, and neither did the room, but the radiator made that low, gruff assent that utilities do when they accept their part in a household. Outside, the rail held, the paint decided to become part of the pavement’s story in its modest way, and the pigeons, despite what had been claimed of their character, behaved.

Work would change again, because work is a river and often someone upstream thinks it is a good day to rearrange the stones. He would be asked to fly and he would say no sometimes with a smile that did not mean compromise. She would be asked to bind a book so fragile it made her breath shallow and she would take an extra day not because she had failed but because care requires it. He would forget to call his mother once and would compensate stupidly with an armful of flowers; she would forgive him with honey and scorn. They would be called names by the papers that did not fit even as a joke. They would find ways to laugh without being unkind. They would sit in rooms that changed their minds about heat and wished for summer and then cursed it when it arrived. They would keep talking to a plant. They would talk to each other twice as much as they talked to a camera. They would write letters that need stamps and sentences that did not. The square would keep the secret shared by many old places: that people go away and come back and sometimes stay, and that the staying is not less a story than the going. They would sleep; they would wake; they would look out of the window and name the weather not as fate but as context. And in the morning there would be tea. And in the evening there would be light. And between, the useful, ordinary business of later.
