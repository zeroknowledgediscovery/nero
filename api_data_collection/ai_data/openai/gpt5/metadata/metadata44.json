     "novel_text": "Mar was born under a busted streetlight on Ferry Street, which might have been a joke some other hand had written into the world to see how she took it. The light stuttered and cut out and came back in a heartbeat rhythm, one bright beat for every motor turning along Jefferson and one bright beat for the river shoving itself along to the lake. She liked to think the flicker had been her first lullaby\u2014electric, stubborn. Libre.\n\nShe grew in secret as all fairies grow, not from some flower or cobweb proper but from milkweed floss dredged off a chain-link fence behind an auto-parts store, from the first day the cracked lot sprouted chicory and someone said, I guess that\u2019s Detroit for you, weeds and music. She had wings, sure. Two fine panes of laced glass hid themselves along her shoulder blades like folded receipts. They caught the sun and fussed at the wind and knew when the city\u2019s weather would flip moods fifteen minutes before the weatherman did. When she walked, people didn\u2019t see the wings. People saw a young woman who scraped paint for cash, who ran errands for an aunt who owned a dress shop on Vernor, who drank burners from the corner bodega and never learned to like the taste but liked how it stained her tongue a violent green.\n\nOn mornings when the river breathed out silver and the island wore its mist like borrowed fur, Mar went to Belle Isle and climbed the iron bones of a streetlamp, right where the paint peeled and downy seeds gathered in the seam. From up there, she watched the water and said hello to the muskrats and the cyclists and to the old men who won or lost arguments with themselves over bait. She liked them all because they were always themselves, even when they lied.\n\n\u201cYou gonna fix the light?\u201d Big Mike called that morning with his voice that bent around its own corners. He sat on his cooler like he had centuries. He had skin like a polished conga and a hat with a feather a child had shoved into it two summers ago, which he wore like a crown.\n\n\u201cI am not the light department,\u201d Mar said. She was. Not the city\u2019s, but someone\u2019s. She put her palm to the metal and listened. The bulb flickered to white for an instant and died back. The wiring smelled burnt and old. \u201cBut I hate the way it coughs.\u201d\n\n\u201cCoughing, it is,\u201d Mike said. \u201cYou hear them drums last night?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich them?\u201d Mar knew the answer. Lovers, drummers, engines, ghosts. Every block, a rhythm.\n\n\u201cAll of them.\u201d He gestured as if showing her a menu. \u201cHold up. Watch that gull. Your thief friend is back.\u201d\n\nThe thief\u2014gull, or kid, or rumor\u2014was a boy about eight who had a backpack too big and pride big enough to match. He came three mornings a week and dipped his net into the water where the shadows of fish made promises. The backpack bulged, not with fish but with the things people threw away along the shore. Bottles. Rusted rings. Once, a broken carburetor, which he had lugged home like a trophy. This morning the boy was already knee-deep, water smacking his shins, shoes soaked. A white bag clung to his calf as if it wanted him to float. He laughed, shook it off, and got another around his other leg. Those bags weren\u2019t right. They moved like fish. They moved like they were moving themselves.\n\nMar\u2019s palm cooled. She felt the change like a note out of key. What had been wind shifted, not just the air but the quality of it. The bags clung and crawled. Big Mike\u2019s laugh canceled in his throat.\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d Mar called. \u201cGet out of there, little man. Now.\u201d\n\nThe boy rolled his eyes the way all eight-year-olds in the presence of someone telling them something they already knew do. He tried to step, but the water yanked his knee the wrong direction, and the bags climbed him with a sound like crinkling foil. Plastic covered his shins, his thighs, each piece seating itself with a soft pop. A supermarket logo smiled where his kneecap should be\u2014a cherry-red grin, Eat Fresh!\u2014and then it slid, tightened.\n\nMar\u2019s wings broke the air without asking her first. They shoved out of their folded places, something inside her saying Yes from a bone place and a blood place and the place where the city had always been running under the city. The blast of wind rippled the river in furrows and almost knocked Mike off his cooler. The boy went down up to his belly and the bags bobbed. The river took one bag and tugged another and then more were there from nowhere, a storm of white and clear and pale blue. She hadn\u2019t seen a storm like this except in co-opsters\u2019 warnings and fishermen\u2019s curses\u2014the way the bags gathered in one place, as if remembering how to hunt.\n\nShe jumped. The lamp\u2019s rust scraped her palms in a familiar breaking way, but the air held her. She didn\u2019t fly like a hummingbird. She flew like a city moving itself along a map, like pothole to pothole is a perfectly acceptable road. Her wings beat, a hush more than a buzz, and she slid low over the river and put her hands into the mess. She could hear the bags whisper\u2014talk, not talk. A woman\u2019s voice beyond the crinkle, sweet as sugar wrappers. Don\u2019t fuss, honey. Just breathe easy. Let me keep you.\n\nShe grabbed the nearest bag and it tried to get slick and get gone. She closed her fingers harder and felt it tear. The sound was three summers of cherry fireworks on the river, not so much a bang as a decision. She tore more. She made for the boy\u2019s legs and ripped, rip-splintered those pretty store logos into streamers. She wasn\u2019t alone. Mike was in the water up to his shins before anyone could yell at him not to be. He took the boy under the arms and lifted; the boy came free with a sucking sound and a gasp that had a laugh clipped to it by fear.\n\n\u201cGot you,\u201d Mike told him, which was how blessings sounded.\n\nOn the air, that other voice cooed again. So many bags, honey. There\u2019s always more. It wasn\u2019t just the bags. Mar looked up and saw her. A girl hovering a dozen feet off the island path, backlit by sun and lamp. Big, not big. She looked human as Mar did, but there was too much there, too much shine on the cheap. Her dress was knotted from grocery bags, layers and layers, a rainbow of oil-sheens. The bags rustled as if a thousand hands were twisting handles around fingers. Every rustle, a laugh.\n\n\u201cHello there,\u201d the girl sang. She moved one hand like she was unsnagging hair from her ring. The river swarmed with more white. \u201cYou\u2019ve got nice wings, babe. That\u2019s cute.\u201d\n\nMar\u2019s wings went tight along her back. She wanted to say a dozen things. She managed one. \u201cThose bags aren\u2019t you. You got no right.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, everything\u2019s me now.\u201d The girl\u2019s voice did an old-time TV switch, nice to news anchor to talk show to lullaby. She drifted closer. Her eyes were the flat reflective of a deli case. She smiled and it sounded. \u201cName\u2019s Poly. You can call me Poli if you want it short, but I like the long one. Pulls on the tongue.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolly like a parrot?\u201d Mike shouted. \u201cYou repeat what others say? Returns policy? Trash bag? Girl, go home.\u201d\n\nThe girl laughed. Every bag on her dress laughed too. The sound came back from the water; two gulls overhead screamed and veered away. \u201cPolycarpella,\u201d she said sweetly. \u201cSince you\u2019re curious. Perhaps your friends read Wal-Mart receipts. We\u2019re all made of names. Hey, little hero. You smell like\u2014what do you smell like? Mmmmm.\u201d She sniffed in Mar\u2019s direction, then rolled the word in her mouth. \u201cOzone and dandelion. Downtown dirt. Choir practice. They sent you up out of that old light, didn\u2019t they? Ferry Street little saint.\u201d\n\nMar had no light to send. She had a boy sputtering water on the ground, and Mike steady, and a little crowd who had turned toward what looked like a fight without knowing what they were looking at. The bags in the river mouthed around the rocks and branches with a fish\u2019s determined aim. Mar\u2019s belly went cold, and then it went angry.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know where I came from,\u201d Mar said. She lifted her hand. Her fingers stung with the river and with whatever the bags were cut from, some sleepiness that felt good in the very bad way. Her body wanted to lean into it. She refused. \u201cYou want to know where you\u2019re going.\u201d\n\nPoly cocked her head, listening to an invisible earpiece. \u201cOh, we\u2019re going everywhere. Every breath. It takes one lifetime to float around the world and back again. Ask the turtles. Ask the kids. Ask the grandmothers who wrap their hair up nights and save those bags under the sink because you never know. Ask Lake Erie what\u2019s in it now. Ask your light. It\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\n\nThe lamp hummed behind Mar like a throat clearing. She whispered to it, not so loud anyone heard, remember what I did to that breaker near the conservatory? Do that. The lamp gave a little agreeable buzz. She took a breath. The city air around her tasted like exhaust and hope. She put breath through her teeth and made a note like her aunt did when she pulled thread through something stubborn. The note was not a song. It was a decision shaped like a sound.\n\nAir flexed. The bags flapped inward, toward Poly\u2019s dress. The river\u2019s face changed. The hanging shreds that had been climbing the boy a heartbeat before lost their will and went slack and drifted off like sea jellies. Micah\u2014Mar didn\u2019t know his name, but she would\u2014clutched Mike with all his little strength and cried and cried because he wasn\u2019t drowning.\n\n\u201cYou think that\u2019s cute?\u201d Poly\u2019s smile changed like a store sign flickering from OPEN to sorry about it, NO. \u201cStealing from me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think those were yours?\u201d Mar said. She didn\u2019t look like much: a normal woman in old boots, an okay haircut, a jacket with pins her aunt had made out of bottle caps. A whole river looked like it was listening to her, and she tried not to notice. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s cute, too.\u201d Poly shook her shoulders and her bags whispered their thousand whispers. More wind. More white in the air like it was snow. \u201cBut we\u2019re fighting. Because when you think you\u2019re a hero, you can\u2019t help yourself. You\u2019ll keep touching my things.\u201d\n\nMar let herself drop. She landed light, knees easy. Mike had the boy by the shoulders and the kid was breathing. The crowd had their phones out now. They didn\u2019t get the focus right\u2014the river moved too much to catch a bag in the act. Someone had a pit bull on a rope and it barked until its voice went hoarse. The three girls who came to the island to Yin-yang their mouths with vape and sing, stopped mid-warble. The park policeman, the good one, looked worried in a way that meant he\u2019d call someone who\u2019d understand.\n\nThe bags made vortices, slow and purposeful, and turned the water into a slow-speed blender. The city felt it. The lamp to Mar\u2019s right flickered the way it did when the Tigers won a game downtown. The pumps under the island coughed. The storm drains muttered wake up. She could taste the metal shapes of their mouths.\n\n\u201cDo it then,\u201d Polycarpella said in her sugar voice. \u201cLift your little hand. It\u2019s a good trick when the breeze is with you. But what about when it isn\u2019t?\u201d\n\nBehind Poly, beyond the white swirl and the hard sun, the skyline squinted up. Glass and steel and brick made all the ways a city can be a mouth. It breathed in. It breathed out, this thing they all lived inside. Mar held out her hand because it wanted to be out there. The air pushed against her palm like a dog.\n\n\u201cGo away,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Poly.\n\nThe bags came down in a crown around Mar and Mike and the boy. It was a clever move: a shrug that turned into a net and then into a fist. Mar heard Mike make a sound like the start of a prayer that hadn\u2019t yet figured out if it would be polite. She heard the boy\u2019s breath come light and catching, like a music box that had been left out in a storm. She heard something else too. A bell.\n\nShe hadn\u2019t heard that bell since the summer she got caught in the Packard ruins and the bums, the lean ones with dust on their eyelashes, traded her safe passage for a story. It was the bell that rang, not in a church, but in the trapdoor of the city\u2019s belly. It said: you\u2019re late.\n\nAuntie Latrice had told her about it. \u201cThat bell,\u201d her aunt had said, eyes on her needle, \u201cis what happens when the city decides you\u2019re in its business. It\u2019s the knock on your ribs and the knock on your door. Get a broom.\u201d\n\nHer hand moved the way it had moved when she was five and sweeping the dress shop floor. She made the broom out of nothing. Or out of everything. Out of her mother\u2019s laugh she barely remembered, out of the engine-turning chug of late buses, out of the breath you take before you lie, out of the breath you take before you tell the truth. It was a broom you couldn't point your phone at, because it didn\u2019t sit still enough to be seen. She took that broom and she swept.\n\nThe bags skittered. You can sweep water. It never looks right, but you can. The surface makes a face and says excuse me? and you do it anyway. The sweep made a clear place where Mike could carry the boy out of the dimpled shallows. It made a path for the bark-girl\u2019s dog to bolt along to its owner. It made Poly blink.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Poly said, almost delighted. \u201cChores.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo home,\u201d Mar told her again.\n\n\u201cI am home. Everywhere\u2019s home, babe.\u201d She drifted away an inch, like a waitress taking a second step when she hadn\u2019t even had a first. \u201cDon\u2019t make this more than it has to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what does it have to be?\u201d Mar said. The broom dissolved. She missed it in her hand and then didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cA wave,\u201d Poly said, all teeth. \u201cAnd a hand. Yours down. Mine up.\u201d\n\nShe lifted. The bags lifted with her. The river took a funny breath again. The stacks downriver exhaled a greenish smoke no one would be able to explain later except to say, it was Tuesday and the wind was east. The girl was going to throw something. Mar\u2019s throat felt salt-scratchy. She steadied, and found the low place in the day where a voice would fit. She did not yet call in the Birmingham or the grid or the memory of the winter they\u2019d had to walk over the Woodward bridge because the buses were stopped. She simply let the lamp\u2019s hum run through her. She let her wings unfurl and decided as much as she could decide.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who collects things,\u201d she said, and she pulled.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a big pull, not the way big pulls are measured in auditorium applause or Richter scales. But it pulled through every thread in her jacket, and through every little brace in the lamp, and through the squirrel the size of a cheap burger that had been watching and saying in squirrel language, is that my business? It dragged through the old Cold Wave on the ground across from the flowerbeds, through the cracked asphalt smoothies, through the river\u2019s wish to be quiet, through the boy\u2019s wish never to see a bag again. It made air where there had been no air, and that air ran its hands into the piles that Poly held.\n\nIt made space, in other words. Poly wasn\u2019t ready for that. Some people never are, when you give them space and they think you\u2019re going to give them pressure. The bags flew apart and sailed up like frightened pigeons. They hung there, waiting for orders. None came.\n\n\u201cCute,\u201d Poly whispered, and now there was something else in her voice. A long mile of something. \u201cYou think space is a thing you can own? Space takes things. Space swallows oceans. Space swallows kids. You go on now with your little broom. We\u2019ll talk again.\u201d\n\nShe turned in the lazy way of someone exiting a slow elevator. The bags folded along with her. She rose, higher than the lamp and higher than the Conservatory\u2019s glass. The sun got in her hair and made each thin film look preposterously holy. Then she was gone in that way only people like them can be gone, which is both away and also on your shoulder all day, telling secrets.\n\nThe crowd\u2019s phones went back to being phones and arguments and plans. The policeman made the kind of note that will end up as a weird story he tells at a cookout. The boy was breathing. Mike turned to Mar with his face saying everything words don\u2019t get paid enough to say. \u201cYou, baby girl,\u201d he said, \u201care going to be late for your aunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have Aunt,\u201d she lied. Latrice would hum at her the way the lamp had hummed, but with more guilt. \u201cI never told her what time I\u2019d be in.\u201d\n\n\u201cBet you she told you,\u201d Mike said. The boy coughed water and the cough turned into hiccups. \u201cYou ever gonna tell me your real-true name? Not the one with the short edges.\u201d\n\nShe thought about waiting. She thought about being a myth at the river. She thought about the way Poly had said her Ferry Street little saint. \u201cMarlene,\u201d she said. \u201cMarlene T. Some people say Mar. Don\u2019t ask what the T stands for. It changes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, Mar-with-a-T,\u201d Mike said, feeling out the taste of it. \u201cTake a day off. You look like you just met somebody you not going to forget. And keep that broom on you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t fit in my backpack.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake a new one,\u201d he said, and patted the boy\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCan we get you some pancakes, young sir? Make this morning drag a little sweetness over the top of itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo pancakes have bags?\u201d the boy asked, hiccups stabbing the words.\n\n\u201cThey do not,\u201d Mike lied. \u201cOnly butter. Only plates. Only us.\u201d\n\nThis would have been where a normal day let itself. Mar walked the paths and stopped to watch a fox melt into a clump of cattails and, because Latrice was right and the world was full of the wrong kind of magic if you weren\u2019t paying attention, tripped on nothing and swore. She took the bridge and let the cars hum under her feet and didn\u2019t take out her phone to call anyone because she needed to keep the taste of Poly\u2019s voice in her mouth until she could figure out what it was. She would call later. She would explain what needed explaining. She would tell Latrice. She would not tell the others yet, though she ought to. The Council would want to know.\n\nOn her way off the island, she passed a sign someone had smashed and someone else had repaired with duct tape. The tape was silver as a pan of coins. She rubbed a knuckle across it to smooth the air out from under. The tape wanted to peel back. It didn\u2019t get to.\n\nThe city stripped off its island clothes and put on its street clothes as she moved north and west. The stadium lights were sleeping, and the gardens people had built in the rubble looked like foreshadowing. Mar walked, not because the bus would be late, but because walking let the day lay itself out in front of her the way you lay pattern pieces out on cloth. Later would be cut and pinned and stitched. Now was chalk marks and the soft whup of scissors.\n\nLatrice\u2019s shop sat on Vernor, just at the corner where you could smell dough rising. Lace & Grit, the window said in looping paint that had been painted by a cousin who made signs and opinions. Inside the dresses hung in a row like candles. Outside the brick held onto last summer\u2019s heat even now. Auntie was at the counter arguing with a button.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re back,\u201d she said without looking up. \u201cYou look like a storm. I can\u2019t use a storm. I can use a breeze. You a breeze?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to be.\u201d Mar sat on the stool and let her back learn to be back in her skin. You couldn\u2019t bring wings to the counter. Her shoulders ached with the pretense. \u201cYou ever hear somebody call herself Polycarpella?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike the saints,\u201d Latrice said, and the needle went in and out like something that could save your life if you let it. \u201cWe had three Carols and two Josephs today. The names in this city are not embarrassed to repeat themselves. Why?\u201d\n\nMar told her. Not all. But enough. The way the bags had behaved. The way the girl had made them sing. The way the river had looked at her with its lid half down and said, well? The broom, a little, until she felt foolish. The way the voice had gotten in her throat like a sugar chunk. The way the bell had rung.\n\nLatrice listened until the listening was a big thing. She set her needle down when it would not drop thread forever and turned slowly so her eyes could see Mar\u2019s face. \u201cYou felt it,\u201d she said finally. \u201cLike when we had the blackout.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe blackout was beer and candles and arguing over whether to open the fridge,\u201d Mar said. \u201cThis was\u2014this was a program coming on I didn\u2019t order.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d Latrice said, and her laugh dried up in her mouth. \u201cI suspect the Council has some say on whether you continue to be cheerfully ignorant. In fact I suspect they always had plans to stop letting you pretend.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go down there yet.\u201d They had danced rooms under the city like a ballroom you only found by walking wrong. Someone had told her, when she was little and had snuck into her aunt\u2019s meetings, that the city two inches under your feet is older and more yes than the city you can see. She believed that. She didn\u2019t want to go there and be told who she was in a room with poor air.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in it whether you go in the room,\u201d Latrice said. \u201cAnd you know it. That bag-girl\u2014she\u2019s nothing small. I\u2019ve heard rumors. She\u2019s got tricks. She likes to call herself mother to the unwanted. She\u2019s the one who makes people feel good when they forget their reusable totes and need to not care. People like her, because caring is a job we are all tired of.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what are we doing,\u201d Mar said, and the words ran out beyond the edge of her patience. \u201cStand behind this counter till maybe the last lake chokes and the last bird coughs? Sew pretty, watch sad?\u201d\n\n\u201cI make wedding dresses, baby,\u201d Latrice said, and the needle jumped into her hand like a fish into a net. \u201cI make people look like the way they want to remember themselves. That ain\u2019t nothing. But I hear you. So you go down there. Tell them what you showed me. They already know about the bags. We all know about the bags. What they don\u2019t know is what you can do with a broom you can\u2019t hold.\u201d\n\nMar looked at her aunt\u2019s hands. They were hands that could catch glass and tell it a story and make it soft. She put her own palms flat on the counter the way her grandmother had done when she decided on a punishment that sounded like a blessing. \u201cI go,\u201d she said, and didn\u2019t like her own voice. It sounded like someone actress-playing her. \u201cBut if they tell me I have a destiny, I\u2019m going to laugh and then cry. And then\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will tell you. You laugh. You cry. Then you take your jacket and you go do it.\u201d Latrice had been soft for a long time, and sometimes that softness hid steel that would not bend for anybody. \u201cYou think the rest of us didn\u2019t get told things? It\u2019s just your turn.\u201d\n\nThe bell on the door rang. It never rang on the first tug. It rang twice like it had been persuaded. Joe\u2014the mailman who was not a mailman anymore but made his rounds anyway because the walking kept his knees working\u2014waved his hat at them and set a box on the counter. It was butcher-papered and tied with string and had a grease mark on one corner. For Lytrice, the scrawl said, which is how the world spelled Latrice when it felt like it.\n\n\u201cFor the girl,\u201d Joe said. \u201cFrom the Packard. And don\u2019t you go unwrapping that without me watching. I like the sound of surprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat girl,\u201d Latrice said, but she was smiling. Joe always knew more than he would ever say.\n\nMar undid the string and the paper fell away like a thing that was happy to be rid of itself. Inside lay a circle. Steel, but not new, and etched with lines like the memory of a map. It was a piston ring, the kind a man might have gone without lunch to buy, back when the factory made engines like the city made songs. The ring was not just a ring. Runes went around it, not from other countries but from here. Fence post. Chimney. Stoop. Neon. Rye bread. Skylight. This is how you talk to a thing when you need it to answer you later.\n\nJoe whistled a note that sounded like the river did under the wrong moon. \u201cThat down-below\u2019s for you,\u201d he said. \u201cTold me to tell you, \u2018don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s already yours.\u2019\u201d He scratched his chin. \u201cYou better go give a hello to the council before they get nervy. I don\u2019t like them when they\u2019re nervy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re always nervy,\u201d Latrice said.\n\n\u201cThen more so.\u201d Joe saluted his hat brim. \u201cAnd wear the thing. Looks like a bracelet. Someone always wanted you dressed for it.\u201d\n\nMar slid the piston ring on her wrist. It didn\u2019t fit. It did. It was heavy, and then it warmed, like exactly the weight she\u2019d been waiting to set down. She could feel in it the memory of being quite busy. Thousands upon thousands of up and down strokes. Heat and friction and oil and songs on the line. For a second, a naked second that made her blink, she heard her grandfather cough. She had never known him. She had known his cough, though, from the way Latrice said it in the kitchen sometimes by accident. It was a good cough, as coughs go. Not mean. Worked too hard, died too early. The cough said: do right.\n\n\u201cGo,\u201d Latrice said. \u201cTell them what you saw. Then come back and pin this hem. You promised Mrs. Hernandez we\u2019d have her looking like a very particular dove.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t promise her. You did.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy birth and bad luck, we\u2019re the same.\u201d\n\nThe day had turned into the kind of afternoon where the heat pawed everything a few times before it lay down in the doorway. Mar took the alley. Alleys are where the city keeps its secrets breathable. She let her shoulders loosen. She let her wings unfurl just an inch in the warm shadow. Then she went into the place where the underneath had made a door out of a manhole cover. The manhole said City The Detroit Water & Sewerage Department, if you asked it out loud. If you asked it the other way, with your palm and your temple bone, it said Hello again, girl. Watch your head.\n\nShe went down. You\u2019d think it would be wet and smell like rot. It smelled like iron and lavender. Somebody always laid dried lavender along the steps, a little spike in each seam. The walls were brick that had been laid by the hands of people who never had a day off in a row. The steps went in a long slow curve, not scary-curvy. The kind of curve your grandmother takes when she\u2019s telling a story and stops to add in something the story needed all along. Mar\u2019s shoes made a nice sound on the treads. She held the bracelet with her fingers and let it be her nerve.\n\nThey were all there at the bottom, as if they'd known she would show up. They had, of course. The city talks. The city doesn\u2019t always talk fast, but it talks.\n\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d said Mr. Solomon, who ran the deli that had never had a sign and didn\u2019t need it. He had a clean apron on, which meant someone else was slicing his corned beef. He had eyes like his city\u2014tired but spry. He put his hand on Mar\u2019s shoulder like he had a right.\n\n\u201cYou do not run this room,\u201d said Madam Delphine, who actually did not either. But she had a voice like a painted door. Her hair was the kind of white that happens when black gets tired of being angry. The ring on her middle finger had a chip in it that used to be a diamond and then had the decency to be a story instead. \u201cSit down, Marlene with a T. We\u2019ve been arguing over your snack like old fools.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like when we argue,\u201d said a man in a suit four sizes too big who went by Calendar. He kept track of things like who had said what first. He turned the wrong page any time the conversation needed to go a day forward by force. He winked at Mar with a practiced beauty that would have gotten him money once and got him information now.\n\nMar sat. The table was round as a hubcap and as old as chalk lines. On it, someone had carved a compass, and the compass had been worn smooth by all the times people\u2019s elbows and ideas had leaned there. A girl younger than Mar brought tea. Her name was Sifa and she had hair like a halo of apologies she didn\u2019t owe anyone.\n\n\u201cTell it,\u201d Madam Delphine said, and her voice had lost its right hand and found its left. That\u2019s as close to gentle as she got.\n\nSo she told it. How the bags moved like they had a mother. How the river made a hurry it shouldn\u2019t have made. How the voice moved like advertising through her head. How she made a broom out of air. How she made a space. How Poly had smiled like good TV.\n\nThey listened the way the long streets listen when you walk them after midnight. They didn\u2019t interrupt a lot. Mr. Solomon said \u201cah\u201d twice. Calendar said \u201cmm\u201d without meaning to. Sifa\u2019s eyes got wet when Mar talked about the boy. Madam Delphine\u2019s hand tapped a little with her ring on the wood.\n\n\u201cPolycarpella,\u201d Mr. Solomon said when she finished. \u201cI knew one once. We all did. We didn\u2019t call her that then. She had three names and none of them stuck. Used people\u2019s waste for her hair ties, even then. She liked the feeling of usefulness without being useful. Dangerous, that. She\u2019s found her power. We knew somebody would. The bags are too many not to make a god.\u201d\n\n\u201cA goddess,\u201d Calendar said, for the notes. \u201cShe be wearing them like a peacock, now. I\u2019ve heard about it around the lake. Cleveland got a slice. Toledo got bit. Sarnia had a little teeth to it too.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a fairy,\u201d Mar said. \u201cNot a god. She knows how to be us.\u201d\n\n\u201cFairies become gods all the time if people keep looking at them while they eat.\u201d Madam Delphine scowled at no one and at Mar, because Mar was nearest. \u201cBut yes, what is she? Not the river. Not the bags, exactly. The wanting, maybe. The we-won\u2019t-be-bothered. The body water cannot digest that says, me me me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what she thinks she is,\u201d Mar said, and felt the way that made her sound. \u201cShe can\u2019t do that. Not in our river. Not in my city. Not with the kid.\u201d\n\nCalendar huffed. \u201cA hero enters,\u201d he murmured. \u201cFate holds her scarf up in the wind.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop it,\u201d Mar said. \u201cStop making it pretty.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be ugly,\u201d Madam Delphine said with the tenderness of a teacher pointing out where the scissors will cut. \u201cLook at me. It will be ugly and it will not turn into an Instagram anything. That boy will dream of white for months. His mother will have a panic every time he bathes. She\u2019ll say it was just garbage and then she will cry when the light is off. And if you lose, if we lose, there will be a rain one day that does not end, and the rain will be clear and full of hands. The turtles will learn nothing but sleep. The city will make a new smell for us, and we will say it is someone else\u2019s smell. Look. At. Me. You already looked, I know. But I am your aunt, and all of us are your aunt today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have an aunt,\u201d Mar said, but she understood. \u201cSo what do we do? What do you tell me I have to do? What\u2019s next?\u201d\n\nMr. Solomon gestured for Sifa to bring the plate. She did. It had three things on it. A spool of thread the color of the Detroit Tigers\u2019 hats. A key that opened a trap door in a church no one used anymore but the pigeons. A piece of blue tile with an iris painted on it from when the station had been nice to itself. \u201cTools,\u201d he said. \u201cWe always start there. And a story.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat story,\u201d Mar said, and she was tired of stories. Stories stole time. Stories saved people. She didn\u2019t get to be unfair to them for long.\n\n\u201cThe one the city told the day they built the street you were born on,\u201d Calendar said. He loved this part. \u201cFerry Street. You know what ferries do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey carry and they pay the price,\u201d Madam Delphine said. \u201cYou do not get a name like that by falling out of a summer window. Your mama heard it in the light. You were born where the broken-glass light is because all lit things break and keep being lit anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t a strategy,\u201d Mar said.\n\n\u201cTake the spool,\u201d Mr. Solomon said, and his voice made God think about brisket. \u201cIt will hold not just in your hand. Tie what you make to something you cannot explain. Take the key. There will be places you think you need to kick. Keys are faster. And the tile. Put it in your mouth if you need to. It remembers water behaving itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a ring,\u201d Mar said, and showed her wrist. Mr. Solomon\u2019s eyes softened. Madam Delphine actually smiled, but sideways like it could be misinterpreted as sympathy. \u201cIt\u2019s my granddaddy\u2019s. That\u2019s what it smells like.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will heat when you need more and cool when you need less,\u201d Madam Delphine said. \u201cYou will bring the broom when you get flanked. Find the place in anything that says, let me through. Find it. Stop asking if you are allowed.\u201d\n\nMar looked around the circle and felt their old fear bunched with their old hope. She hated both because they were so lazy. She loved both because without them no one ever did anything. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll go back to the river at the time the bags like best. I\u2019ll find her. I will make her explain. And if she won\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not threaten,\u201d Mr. Solomon said. \u201cDon\u2019t ever tell the water what it will do. It will remind you. Go as you, not as a soldier. She will mistake you for small. That is when you move.\u201d\n\nShe left with the ring snug like a small good curse around her wrist and the spool and key and tile was in her pocket. When she got to the street, the afternoon had become a story that included thunder at the edges. She walked back toward the river because it seemed best to walk. She passed the mural of the girl with wings that had been painted by a kid with a can who had never met a fairy and had gotten it right anyway. She touched the brick under the paint and the paint under the brick. She passed the school whose windows were open in deliberate August and the scent of markers and a teacher\u2019s desperation fell onto the sidewalk in waves. She stepped over a little waterfall of pop bottles that someone\u2019s cousin had kicked aside to make a path to the bus stop bench.\n\nThe bags were not there yet but their cousins were: wrapper-birds pecking at corners, a plastic ribbon trying to be a snake. Mar knelt and picked up three things she could put in the bin without making it a religion. She tied the spool\u2019s end to the railing and let the rest of the thread fall along the path. If someone tripped, she would apologize to them in her head and mean it.\n\nShe reached the place where an old concrete lip makes a small amphitheater for the river to gossip to itself. That\u2019s where she sat and waited for the hour when things that shouldn\u2019t happen generally decide to happen anyway, because other things are tired and the day is too long and everyone wants a short cut.\n\nIt came like rain that misses you and then gets you back. The river sighed as if it remembered it had something to do. A few bags spun out of a hidden current and made their private ballet. Then more. Then enough that a man walking his dog picked up the dog reflexively because he had heard a story from a cousin about a cousin\u2019s cousin, and stories scare more than facts ever do. Mar tasted sugar. Poly had come without announcing herself this time. Which meant she was learning.\n\n\u201cDid you put out a line,\u201d Polycarpella said, and there was affection in it as if she were complimenting a child with chalk on her hands. \u201cYou\u2019ll catch nothing and everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome sit,\u201d Mar said. \u201cTalk. I don\u2019t get paid overtime.\u201d\n\nPoly laughed and came down like a queen and a cigarette, both, and sat on the rail so her bags could slide and shimmy. \u201cYou got your little tools,\u201d she observed. \u201cSo do I. You showed me a trick this morning. I like tricks. We should trade. That\u2019s a city thing, isn\u2019t it? I give you an easier life. You give me the air.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that all? The air?\u201d Mar\u2019s ring warmed. The thread around the railing hummed like a June bug.\n\n\u201cThe ability to stop fussing,\u201d Poly corrected. \u201cGive me that. Tell your friends they can stop counting their recycled cans. Let the world be heavy and rich in plastic. Let me wrap it. Let me keep it safe. You can go and sew dresses and I will sew the rest. They love me,\u201d she added with a small almost-win. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the love I get. Little old ladies who have saved every single bag from every single grocery trip. They feel good when they give them to me. Boys who lick sauce off the corner of a carry-out bag and bite it a little because it tastes like pepper. They\u2019ll give me theirs too. I am put to use. I am wanted. You understand that one, I bet.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want me to bless it,\u201d Mar said. \u201cBecause if a saint blesses it, it becomes fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said saint,\u201d Poly murmured. \u201cNot me.\u201d\n\nThe river broke and fixed itself around them. A boat went by, and a man whose whole job was to wave waved. Poly didn\u2019t exist for him. That was one of the worst parts, and one of the oldest. There are always people doomed to be looked through.\n\n\u201cLet me show you something,\u201d Poly said, and her voice made the knots in her bag-dress pop like corn. She put out her hand, and Mar put out hers, and for a second they touched\u2014not fingers, but intention. A little spark lit. Poly pulled.\n\nMar fell into a hard bright thing. You can fall into things that are not holes. You can fall into a smell or a sound. She fell into the feeling she gets when she goes home and opens the cupboard where the plastic bags live, though she had been the one to make sure there were only six in there. She fell into the sensation of a bag on her hand as she carried bottles home, the way it cuts your fingers when you refuse to take two trips. She fell into the first bag she had ever touched, when she was four and bored and made a kite out of it and watched it thrash and thought, oh.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d Poly said into her ear when ears were not ears and river was not river. \u201cWe are all together. So easy. Why not like this forever?\u201d\n\nMar wanted to nod. It was easier. She could cry later. She could be righteous later. The ring went cool on her wrist. Her aunt\u2019s needle pricked her thumb from a century away. She remembered the man who had waved because that had been his whole job. She remembered milkweed floss snagged on a fence, half soft and half with the fence still in it. She remembered Big Mike saving the boy. She remembered the broom.\n\n\u201cBecause my hands still work,\u201d she said.\n\nShe pushed, not to shove Poly away but to make space again. Poly squeaked\u2014just a small sound, but a real one. Mar slid out of that airless hung thing. She put her feet on concrete and it felt like the best bed in the universe. She grabbed the thread that lay along the path and wrapped it around her palm and threw the free end toward Poly\u2019s dress.\n\nThe thread snicked into the bags. The color spread. Navy like a baseball night. Poly snatched at it. It tied itself in three loops around three different handles. It didn\u2019t want to be a ribbon. It wanted to be a line. It wanted to be a road laid down between two places.\n\nMar yanked. Hard. Not angry, not yet. Hard the way you pull weeds, the way you pull a friend out of a fight. The bags snapped. Three blows the river took like kisses. The bits darted and skittered, but they were bits now, not whole. Behind Poly, the air wobbled. She looked back like someone just said her name in her mother\u2019s voice the day she was supposed to start school. Her face, for a breath, was young. It wasn\u2019t kind. Young is never kind when you catch it.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be mean,\u201d Poly said softly. \u201cI wanted it soft. You don\u2019t want soft. So it\u2019ll be mean. Your choice, baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want,\u201d Mar said, and didn\u2019t finish yet, because the river decided the rest. A gust came off it like someone early to work flipping all the chairs off all the tables. The bags lifted. The thread hummed out of her hand in a long line that tied itself to the key in her pocket, which, how, but it did. The ring warmed so quickly it startled her into a laugh that sounded like a choke. Poly\u2019s hands blurred. The air between water and street made little gasps. People moved away without knowing why.\n\nMar held on. She held the line because it was in her hand. She held the key because it had decided to be the weight she needed. She held the memory of milkweed floss and the way last fall it had flown like a promise and like an apology out over the lots where buildings used to be and the lots where people would make gardens when the ground gave them back all the little things the last people had asked of it.\n\nPoly\u2019s face changed again. It stopped being TV. It stopped being bought. It became a face that was only a face. Then she was gone again, this time fast, like she\u2019d been yanked in a direction she didn\u2019t like to go.\n\nMar didn\u2019t stand like a victor. She didn\u2019t whoop. She let herself sit as soon as she could and breathe that heavy river air until it felt like she could remember how to tell her lungs and the city\u2019s lungs apart. The thread lay around her like a cat. The ring cooled slowly, the pleasant way a burned pan cools, all sizzle and suddenly sensible. The key hummed in her pocket. Beyond her, the river kept doing the only thing it knew: be too much and be exactly enough.\n\nSomebody clapped. She almost yelled at them. It was Big Mike, who had somehow walked across half a city a man his size had no business conquering in an hour. He held a pancake to-go box in one hand and his hat in the other. He had two more kids with him now, because kids attach themselves to the adults they suspect will not lie to them today.\n\n\u201cBrought you some sweetness I promised the boy,\u201d he said, as if all this had been on pause while he picked up syrup. \u201cYou look like you just ran a marathon sitting down. That\u2019s my favorite cardio.\u201d\n\n\u201cI held a thing I didn\u2019t know I could,\u201d Mar said faintly.\n\nMike got serious like a curtain when it\u2019s time. \u201cYou keep that thing near. Because she ain\u2019t a one-time. You know that now. She wants to be every breath. And you, looks like, a breath she didn\u2019t plan for. You don\u2019t fight that by being mad alone. Even Jesus had twelve.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got the Council,\u201d Mar said, making a face.\n\n\u201cYou got me,\u201d Mike said. \u201cYou got your aunt. You got that boy, who gonna draw you on his notebook a thousand times and make you look worse each time. You got those kids. You got the lady behind you pretending to tie her shoe who just took film of more than we thought a phone can see. Oh, you got plenty. And you got yourself, Mar. That\u2019s the loudest one of all.\u201d\n\nShe opened the pancake box and laughed, for real this time, at the two fat round cakes smiling up with bubbling syrup and a pat of butter like the moon. She ate one careful bite before the breeze jerked and threw a curl of hair into her mouth. She picked it out, annoyed and alive, and said to the river because it was the only thing that could hold it, \u201cI want this city not to drown.\u201d\n\nThe river shrugged. It had work to do. But it heard her. And far down under the steps, under the tiles with irises painted on, a bell restlessly thought about ringing again soon.The storm that had been thinking about itself all afternoon finally took the job. It came across the city with its cuffs rolled, the way a good barber approaches a head that has not had a cut in awhile. Clouds buttoned as if someone practiced with nimble fingers, and the wind tasted like someone had knocked a pipe in a basement you hadn\u2019t visited in years. Latrice stood in the shop doorway with a pin in her mouth, looking up like she didn\u2019t approve of weather that got ideas.\n\n\u201cYou going to make me hem in this?\u201d she asked, and Mar laughed because the thunder had a sense of humor you had to acknowledge or it would get petty.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll pin while you baste,\u201d Mar said. She moved behind the counter and let the thread in the spool in her pocket settle against the wood like a cat that knew exactly which lap was home. She had washed the river off her arms, but you don\u2019t wash the river out of your ears, not if it has spoken your name; every noise in the city was slotted now into before and after the bell. Across the street, a man locked down his fruit stand with a tarp that had once been a banner that said VOTE and now said OTE. A girl ran with her hair uncoiling like a ribbon thinking better of a bow. Somewhere a bus sighed at a corner and decided it could be late without anyone breaking a deal.\n\nThe bell in her chest rang not out loud and not quiet either. It stole the taste of the last sentence she had been about to say and replaced it with the exact route to take if you wanted to get to the wrong door on purpose. She saw it in the seam between two clouds like the gleam in a friend\u2019s eye when they have a good bad idea. On the counter, the piston ring warmed the skin under it as if to say, I have opinions about this sort of weather. Latrice pulled the pin from her mouth and set it down in the little turtle-shaped dish that kept them together.\n\n\u201cGo,\u201d she said without sighing. \u201cYou walking or you thinking you can bribe a bus to be on time?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe buses and I are having a separation,\u201d Mar said, and Latrice took the dress in her hands and turned it in a way that meant she was both listening and keeping it patient. \u201cI\u2019ll cut through by the stadium. If I see Mr. Solomon I\u2019ll tell him your rye bread is still making me dream about butter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see Mr. Solomon in this weather, he\u2019s under an awning protecting something,\u201d Latrice said. \u201cTake the green jacket. The one with the deep pockets. I don\u2019t want to watch you drop a tile down a storm drain and make me have to pretend not to laugh.\u201d\n\nThe jacket had been made three winters ago out of army surplus that had met a handful of glitter and decided to reconsider its life. Latrice had deepened the pockets not because she suspected a niece would need to carry charms, but because people need to carry things. The iris tile went into one pocket. The key went into the other. The ring sat on her arm like it had every right. The spool thread she looped across her shoulders beneath the jacket, and it hummed along her collarbone, pleased to have a path. She tried the broom in her hands and it didn\u2019t come. It wasn\u2019t a thing you could call when you were half-dressed. It came when the bell told it to or when your hands remembered a sweep all by themselves.\n\nShe kissed her aunt on the cheek because some days you don\u2019t let yourself be cool. On Vernor the air came thin and sharp already, the rain not yet falling, the electric in the wires practicing a murmur. Down the block boys shouted at the sky like they could make it choose the other street. A dog\u2019s nails clicked as its owner hurried the walk because the last time the thunder had thrown its weight around, the dog had tried to climb into the deli case. The wind tugged at the edges of billboards so they billowed and sucked back, trying on tomorrow\u2019s messages and then resettling into today\u2019s. She walked with her hands inside the jacket, fingers on ring and thread and tile and key, as if each finger could be a different person with something to say.\n\nAt the corner of Michigan and Rosa Parks, a red boy leaned on a mailbox and watched her approach with a slouch that every generation had invented for themselves and borrowed from the last. He was not a boy and not a man and not anything you could point to without the pointing doing the wrong thing. He wore a gray hoodie with the sleeves pushed up, though if you looked too long, you saw the sleeves were a shade too bright and too old a cut to be bought last year. His sneakers were new the way a fox is new when it\u2019s just changed coats. His hair stuck up in a whorl like a flame remembering itself. The corner looked quieter where he stood, which is how you noticed him if you didn\u2019t already know.\n\n\u201cYou going to them pipes,\u201d he said as if he had been stealing the bell\u2019s mail for centuries. He wouldn\u2019t come to you unless he had an insult under his tongue he thought you could take. He grinned. \u201cYou smell like pancakes and decisions. That\u2019s nasty. You got any sugar for me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour timing is disrespectful,\u201d she said, but she dug in her jacket anyway and found, to her own dirty delight, that Big Mike had stuffed two little sugar packets into the pancake box, because of course he had. She held one up. The red boy\u2019s eyes brightened in a way that made you forget small cruelties and remember bigger ones.\n\n\u201cYou know me,\u201d he purred, and walked two fingertips in the air as if he had feet up there. \u201cYou so clever you probably know all my names too, the ones people only use when they want to get a little clout off of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know the one my great-grandmother called you when she was drunk at Easter and the ham went the wrong way,\u201d Mar said. \u201cAnd I know you aren\u2019t here to scare me, because if you were here to scare me, you wouldn\u2019t ask for sugar. You\u2019d just take it.\u201d\n\nHe laughed like a firecracker at a low-grade parade that will surprise you anyway. \u201cYou think you got me,\u201d he said. \u201cI got me. That\u2019s my whole problem. I come in when they make the same mistake twice with the same kind of stubborn. That\u2019s today, baby. That\u2019s your plastic girl thinking she can be rain. That\u2019s you thinking you can be a wall. You ain\u2019t a wall. You\u2019re a door. Remember that. You give me the sugar and I\u2019ll tell you something not obvious.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll tell me something obvious in a way that will annoy me,\u201d she said, but she tore open the packet and tapped the crystals onto his palm, and when his hand touched hers it felt exactly like skin should, hot and small and real. He threw the sugar back like a shot and shuddered with pleasure so human it snapped, for a second, the magic clean in two. He leaned closer, breath sweet now, voice not sweet at all.\n\n\u201cYou got a friend in the drains. She don\u2019t think she\u2019s your friend because she think you kids put dirt under her skirt, which, fair, but she\u2019s tired of new dirt. Talk to the old iron. Talk to the woman with the chain of keys who unlocks more than she knows. She got a ring of power and she think it\u2019s for doors only. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s a song. Also,\u201d he finished, smacking his lips with a vulgarity that made a toddler across the street grin, \u201cif it smells like cucumber melon, that\u2019s where your girl Poly thickest. She likes comfort.\u201d\n\n\u201cCucumber melon is a sin and a half,\u201d Mar said, and the red boy howled with appreciation, clapped his hands once, and was the air again next to the mailbox with a sticker on it that said WE MISS YOU and didn\u2019t specify who.\n\nShe skirted the stadium because you don\u2019t ask a place to bless you if you didn\u2019t buy a ticket. The rain began in a run of coins, big drops scattered far, making the dust jump. She cut between garages and let the chain link fence tell her gossip with its little rattling teeth. On the river side of Jefferson the city bent itself down into its working face. Pipes swallowed bad news fast. Gulls jerked like paper caught in a breath. The sign at the fence that said NO TRESPASS in two languages had been Sharpied over to say PLEASE TAKE ONLY WHAT YOU CAN CARRY, which is not any better and somehow felt kinder.\n\nShe had been to the Detroit Wastewater Treatment Plant once as a seventh grader, because some teacher had thought that showing children what happens after a flush would make them love civic systems. She had half-listened then and she had listened to the pipes. She had remembered the smell as a sentence that had every clause you could imagine and then a few more. Today it was worse and not. The rain hit warmed concrete and called up last summer\u2019s afternoons when the city had been very tired and wanted to sit down in the middle of the street, but it also began to collect, and when the city collects water it finds its old paths again, which is a relief, if you are built of old paths.\n\nAt the service gate a woman stood with a ring of keys so heavy it made her lean a little, the way love does if you don\u2019t distribute it properly across your day. She had on a poncho that had seen better uncles. Her hair, braided, was pinned up under a cap with a logo that had been washed so often it looked like a family story. She watched the rain like it was a supervisor she didn\u2019t like and had to make nice with. When she saw Mar, she lifted her chin, a greeting that nobody would notice if they weren\u2019t meant to.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d she said, and there was a smile under the words but only if you worked for it. \u201cWe got a model say we about to overflow like preachers\u2019 plates. You one of the ones who makes the pumps listen?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m one of the ones who makes the pumps tell me why they\u2019re sulking,\u201d Mar said. She wanted to be small; she wanted to be joke; she wanted to be useful without anyone putting a name on it and making her shake. \u201cCouncil sent me. Maybe I sent myself. The bell isn\u2019t clear on paperwork.\u201d\n\n\u201cBell\u2019s never clear,\u201d the woman agreed. She shifted her keys like she was letting them settle into their favorite place on the ring. \u201cName\u2019s Ernestine. Do not call me Ernie unless you bring me empanadas. You got something heavy on you? You look like a coat hook.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a ring,\u201d Mar said, and showed her. Ernestine\u2019s eyes sharpened in the way people\u2019s eyes do when they see something specific in a sea of mess.\n\n\u201cThat little cousin\u2019s been missing from the plant\u2019s museum since my second divorce,\u201d she observed, and then laughed at Mar\u2019s face. \u201cRelax. We ain\u2019t the kind to push paper at you. We\u2019re the kind to push buttons when the paper says do not push. Come on. We got secondary clarifiers looking like cappuccino and it ain\u2019t time of day for that. If your bag-girl going to turn the rain into a carrying system, she\u2019s going to hit us where the pipes and the rivers have to shake hands. That means outfalls. That means every mouth in this city we pretend to have under control.\u201d\n\nThey ducked into the facility and the smell got complicated. Rain plus iron plus a whiff of something sweet that did not belong. Cucumber melon, faint and vicious, as if a high school locker had been opened fifty miles away and blown in ahead of a squall. Ernestine\u2019s keys chattered. She took stairs fast, her boots knowing where not to slide. The plant was a maze built by men who had never gotten lost in a grocery store because they had wives with lists. Ernestine did not get lost. She didn\u2019t glance back to see if Mar was keeping up. That was trust, in a way.\n\nAt a steel door at the bottom of a flight, Ernestine slapped a card and turned a key at the same time. The door sighed open as if it had been holding its breath since noon. Inside, a low room spread itself under a forest of thicker pipe. Rainwater on concrete ran toward drains that had mouths like hungry things. The sound of the whole city\u2019s habit came through the walls, a million little secrets arguing over who would go first down the slope. In the far corner, a grate strained. Water had gathered there where water had no permission to be. It roiled like it had been stirred by a spoon. In it, white.\n\nIt was not a white you could call innocent. It was the white you get when you mix too many paints and the paper gives up; it was the center of store-bought bread; it was the smile on a bag printed with a green leaf that had never met a tree. The bags came out of the swollen grate like eels learning to be daylight. They were narrow and long where they had been stretched by current. They slipped around each other and made a braid. Ernestine said a swear word that had been used by her mother and then apologized to the wall, because the wall had a saint taped to it from someone else\u2019s superstition.\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t ours,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s nobody\u2019s. That\u2019s your girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all of ours,\u201d Mar said, not to be contrary, but because if she started pretending otherwise she would never be able to look at a kitchen sink again. \u201cCan you hold her here?\u201d\n\nErnestine gave the grate a hard look. \u201cDepends what you mean by hold. If I close the gate upstream, it\u2019ll blow a lid somewhere else. If I open, we flush the river with filth and your bag-baby gets a ride. We designed this for storms, we just didn\u2019t design it for malice.\u201d\n\n\u201cCall the pumps,\u201d Mar said, and Ernestine laughed like a mechanic.\n\n\u201cThe pumps stay kissing my feet. They\u2019re already screaming for me.\u201d\n\nThe ring on Mar\u2019s wrist warmed. The thread around her throat hummed like a crowd waiting to catch a chorus. She put her palm on the pipe nearest her that had beads of condensation fat as pearls and listened as if it were the only voice and knew better. The pumps said: tired. The pumps said: we will do it anyway. The pipes said: keep them out of our teeth. The grate said: I am a mouth and I am not designed for this food.\n\nThat smell came again, cucumber melon, the bath gel of someone who didn\u2019t trust water to be itself and had to dress it up. Polycarpella\u2019s voice brushed the low ceiling like a shawl shaking itself out. Heard you brought a key, it said. That\u2019s precious. I brought me.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be in here,\u201d Ernestine told the air, which is how you address anything you plan to fight without hurting feelings you will need to live in later. \u201cWe got rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, rules,\u201d Poly cooed, and in the grate the braid of bags went slicker, slicker, until it became a hand. Not a hand. A suggestion of a hand, a mitt shape, the idea of grip. It slid under the surface and pushed. The water bulged as if someone standing under it were about to cough.\n\nMar put her fingers in the heavy ring and pulled a little on the memory of up-down. The piston ring remembered its job and sent its rhythm into her bones. The pumps heard it and said Oh. They found an old timing, the way a choir finds a key after the tenors go adventuring. Ernestine\u2019s keys hummed against her hip, sympathetic. Above them the thunder put its shoulders against the sky and pushed again. The grate jumped.\n\n\u201cYou got that key?\u201d Ernestine said, not because she wanted to watch a magic trick, but because a person wearing a key should be allowed to use it before you ask them to use their blood. Mar dug into the pocket and pulled it out. It was heavier than it looked and didn\u2019t look light to begin with. It had teeth worn smooth by a door that liked being opened. She put it in her hand and it sat there and waited to be told a story.\n\n\u201cOpen what,\u201d she asked Ernestine, because sometimes the best thing magic can do is respect human habit.\n\nErnestine pointed to a box the size of a good suitcase that had been bolted shut since sneaky became a word. \u201cThat\u2019s where the backwash gate lives. You can crack it and make a joke out of my job or you can crack it and give us twenty seconds of mercy. Only you\u2019ll know which the second it starts to move. You ready to be responsible for the difference?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mar said, and set the key in the lock. The teeth caught like an echo finding its source. She turned because her hand wanted to, not because she had been told. The box lid creaked open less than an inch and the ring on her wrist went hot enough to make her hiss, which made Ernestine reach for her instinctively and then pull her hand back because she had been taught not to get between a person and their work.\n\nThe water in the corner changed its face. It released a breath it had been pretending not to hold, a sigh that rolled like a baby back onto a bed. The bags in the braid fluttered as if the idea of a hand had been corrected by a teacher with an eraser. The pumps hit their rhythm with a little hop, and Ernestine grinned, which made her look like her sister\u2019s prom picture and not a woman who had been keeping the city from drowning since the Clinton administration.\n\n\u201cYou a door,\u201d said a voice next to Mar\u2019s ear, and she swung her head and saw nobody because the red boy doesn\u2019t show up where men have wrenches in their hands. \u201cRemember when you pretend to be a wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop helping if you\u2019re not going to help,\u201d she told him under her breath, and from the far corner Ernestine said, \u201cWe good?\u201d and the grate said, \u201cNot yet,\u201d and the bags said, in Poly\u2019s many mouths, \u201cCutie, you think your sound matters more than mine?\u201d\n\nPoly came in through a hairline crack between the idea of rain and the idea of a pipe. She did not need a door because she could be the idea of a door. She unfolded herself the way a well-folded t-shirt disappoints you and then becomes your favorite again by accident. In the low light her dress of bags looked like satin if satin had been invented by a factory that loved turtles. Her hair was wet and perfect. The smell in the room turned sugared, then snapped bitter as if someone had poured a cologne and a cleanser into the same sink and told them to make peace.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t invite me,\u201d she said, and put her bare foot down on the concrete where the water ran in a thin sheet. The water tried to get out from under her and could not, which offended it. \u201cIt\u2019s sweet to be somewhere people think they can count. It makes me feel like a teenager in a shoplifting way.\u201d\n\nErnestine reached for a lever with the calm of someone who has extinguished three different small fires this week without getting to tell anyone. \u201cWe got rules,\u201d she repeated, and Poly smiled at her as if she kept a gratitude journal.\n\n\u201cYou have habits,\u201d she said. \u201cRules are temporary, habits are religion. I am a habit.\u201d\n\n\u201cHabits can be broken,\u201d Ernestine said, and her hand tightened. \u201cAsk my second ex.\u201d\n\nMar stepped forward because if she didn\u2019t, the room would get shoved into the place where she didn\u2019t get to participate in her own morning. She lifted the spool thread from under her collar and let it run into her palm. It shone navy even in the bad light, a quiet blue that belonged to men in caps late after a game. She flicked the end of it at the water where Poly had made her hand-shape. The thread skipped across the surface the way tiny stones do when a child who has not yet learned to respect lakes throws what they have. The thread touched a bag. The bag winced.\n\n\u201cHow many you got,\u201d Poly asked her pleasantly. \u201cYou think you can pick them off one at a time? You think you can snip every hair on my head without me noticing and slapping your fingers?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I can teach your hair not to like its split ends,\u201d Mar said, and Ernestine made a noise that was either a laugh or a small cry, hard to tell which from this angle. \u201cI think the pumps are going to sing over you. I think the grate is tired of being kinked. I think the city loves you only because you make their hands feel busy and the difference between that and worship is going to ruin you.\u201d\n\nPoly\u2019s smile flattened. The bags at her shoulders tightened and chattered against each other like teeth. \u201cYou think you\u2019re the only girl with an aunt,\u201d she said softly. \u201cYou think someone didn\u2019t teach me a sewing trick? Come on then. Let\u2019s stitch.\u201d\n\nShe flicked her fingers and the bags braided faster. They made cords. The cords made ropes. The ropes made a weave. It was not a net that you would fish with. It was a net you would throw over a mouth. It lifted and came down, and the grate squealed in the voice of a metal animal that hates what it has been asked to do and must do it anyway. Ernestine swore the swear again and then another one that was older and was nobody\u2019s business but her grandmother\u2019s. She threw her weight on the lever. Water, disrespected, slapped up and hit Mar in the face. It tasted old and new and made a little sadness bloom at the back of her tongue that she did not have time to attend to.\n\nThis was where the broom should be, her hand told her, and her hand was right. She breathed not in through her nose and not through her mouth but through the space where her face had been when she was five and clean. The broom came. It came as a weight in her grip that made her shoulders remember echoing church basements with folding chairs and sweeping after a wake. She pushed it forward, not down, and the water went where she asked, not like it was obedient, but like it was curious whether she might be right. The weave hit the broom and snarled. That pleased the weave as weaves love to tangle. The thread in her other hand looped around the mess without being asked because thread can be that way when it sees a chance to be glory.\n\nPoly dropped her voice to a whisper that almost had admiration in it and then didn\u2019t. \u201cOh, you do chores,\u201d she said, and the weave tried to ride up the broom handle and eat Mar\u2019s arms. The ring flared heat that stopped at the edge of pain and lived there on purpose. It strobed. The pumps found the strobe and matched it, and for a second the room felt like a club for the blessed and exhausted. Ernestine pressed two buttons at once and then a third she had promised herself she would never press unless water touched her ribs.\n\nThe key in Mar\u2019s pocket started to hum in a way you could feel in your teeth. She grabbed it with three fingers and held it against the broom\u2019s handle. The broom, which had been nothing-to-see, became something. It became a good five inches of a real broom at its end, straw and wire and the ghost of your aunt\u2019s broom from her kitchen. Poly noticed. Her smile turned up in one corner like an anger that had decided it would wear lipstick.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to ruin your hair,\u201d she said sweetly, and the cucumber melon smell thickened to the point where Ernestine gagged and snapped a little piece of peppermint out of her pocket and put it under her tongue like a spell. \u201cYou wear that ring like it\u2019s a lapel pin. Do you even know what it can pull? Do you know how many cars forgot and still started because somebody begged them? I am the forgetting and you are the begging. Don\u2019t embarrass yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou talk like a commercial,\u201d Mar said. She pushed the broom again and the weave caught and sagged and had to make a decision about whether it wanted to be a rope or a net. The pumps stuttered once, twice, and then came in heavier, not because the electricity loved them, but because somebody out there in the plant had kicked something that needed kicking. Ernestine sucked in a breath that made the hairs on Mar\u2019s arm stand up and yelled without looking toward the ceiling, \u201cWhoever did that, I will bring you empanadas!\u201d and it was the right thing to say.\n\nThe iris tile was heavy in her pocket in a way that had nothing to do with clay. She pulled it out and for a second she thought she might actually put it in her mouth, which was absurd and perfectly fine. She pressed it to her lower lip. The paint tasted old blue. It tasted like the station did on a good day when somebody had dragged a broom up the marble just because attention is a kind of soap. She let that taste into her chest and then into the room.\n\nIt changed the water\u2019s posture. It made a memory in it. It made it recall how it looks when it carries lanterns down river instead of names on plastic. Poly frowned\u2014not a great big victory, but a chip. The weave lost heart for a flicker. Mar\u2019s thread made a loop. The loop caught. It tied itself into a knot that was not structurally sound but was spiritually influential. She yanked with all the small strength in her back and the ring said up-down again like a song you could take to the church of your choice.\n\n\u201cA door,\u201d the red boy whispered, almost pleased. \u201cYou opening and closing in the same breath. Can\u2019t decide what you are. That\u2019s how you survive.\u201d\n\nThe weave broke. It tore in three long boohoo strips that went sulking toward a drain they should never have met. The grate shivered itself back into reasonable, which is a thing grates can do when they feel respected. Ernestine whooped in a language the pumps understood and did not like but forgave her for. The cucumber melon smell cut out so abruptly it was like someone had taken a mother\u2019s voice out of a room. Poly stood in the middle of the tired light and looked not cheap and not holy. She just looked like a girl in a dress that had been made out of apologies.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re inconvenient,\u201d she said to Mar as if she were discussing a calendar. \u201cDo you always disappoint people who want to feel good? Is that your kink?\u201d\n\n\u201cI like to make quilts out of people\u2019s plans,\u201d Mar said. She was shaking a little now because the broom wanted to be gone and her hands wanted to keep it. \u201cGo home.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I told you before,\u201d Poly said, and for the first time her voice went true under the sugar. \u201cEverywhere\u2019s home.\u201d She looked at Ernestine, who stared back with the raw amused contempt of women who get three hours of sleep and make coffee taste like an apology men should be ashamed to accept. \u201cThey will love me tomorrow. They will forget this. They will throw away the things they need and then call themselves the victims. You\u2014\u201d she pointed at Mar, delicate, because you do not use the full hand when you threaten someone you respect\u2014\u201cyou will keep doing chores. I will keep being a habit. See you at the lake.\u201d\n\nShe broke along a seam no one else could see and went out through the pipe, not up not down, but sideways in the way the city sometimes takes if you make one wrong turn and end up at a view of downtown that makes you forget what you were late for. The room loosened itself around Mar and Ernestine like a fist that had decided it did not want to hit anybody, not today. Rain came harder. Somewhere a man yelled wait up! to rain like it owed him money.\n\nErnestine leaned back against the wall and slid down until she was sitting on the wet floor with her legs straight out and her keys spilling over her knee. \u201cWe going to the lake,\u201d she said, and there was a small frightened boy in that sentence and also a woman with a clipboard who was ready to write down when and who and what boat. \u201cGood. I don\u2019t sleep on lake days anyway. Here.\u201d She pulled a little brown bottle from her pocket, the kind a person keeps because they believe in minor miracles. She offered it. \u201cPeppermint. Or moonshine. Hard to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeppermint,\u201d Mar said, and let the sharpness clear the last of the cucumber out. \u201cThank you. For not asking me if I could do that meaner. For not asking me why I\u2019m not more magical.\u201d\n\n\u201cI seen magical,\u201d Ernestine said. \u201cIt always shows up looking like work. You any good outside in a blow, or you going to get peeled off the rail like a sticker?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tie myself down,\u201d Mar said. She meant it and wasn\u2019t sure how. The thread on her shoulder purred like it had an idea.\n\n\u201cWe got a line boat,\u201d Ernestine said, getting up in the way she had trained her knees to do it without complaining in public. \u201cNot going to be fancy. Going to be ours. You want help, ask for it. Don\u2019t ask the red one. He loves watch disasters like a World Cup and he bet the wrong side on purpose. Ask the bridges. They always know who is lying. And take a slicker. You\u2019re about to be wetter than your aunt trying not to say what she is thinking at a wedding.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know my aunt,\u201d Mar asked, because sometimes you ask a ridiculous thing to see what the city will admit.\n\n\u201cI know the way certain women hold their mouths when they have to pin two edges that don\u2019t belong,\u201d Ernestine said. \u201cYou all got the same grandmother. Now move, or my pumps will decide they live for you and I can\u2019t have that. I have a relationship with them that does not need a third party.\u201d\n\nThey made decisions quickly then because the storm had decided to commit. Ernestine slapped a list into a hand, and the hand belonged to a man who had fixed a laugh wrong once and had not had time to fix it again. He ran. She picked up a radio and squeezed it until it squealed and told whoever was on the other end to call the line boat and tell them to wear the good life vests, not the ones with foam trying its best. She told Mar where to go that would get her to a dock that sailors used when the city wasn\u2019t looking.\n\nOn her way up, the red boy leaned out of a shadow at the stair\u2019s bend and held out something tiny and bright in his palm. It was a penny from a year they had said meant something and forgotten why. It had been rubbed so smooth no face was left on it, just a round assertion that copper loves fingers.\n\n\u201cSteal me a habit,\u201d he murmured, feral and almost kind. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you back with gossip.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need news from upriver,\u201d she said, and took the penny because pennies ask not to be turned away. \u201cI need where she likes to sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe likes to sleep under signs that say NO FISHING,\u201d he said, delighted by his own meanness, and he blew her a kiss he intended to annoy her and succeeded and was gone with a smell like Friday night.\n\nThe rain came proper when she hit the levee. It flattened hair and expectation without asking permission. The river fluffed itself despite the weight. The skyline went bruise-purple in a way that made the glass hotels apologize for themselves. A line boat waited with two men in orange vests and a woman who had a cigarette in the corner of her mouth that the rain could not budge. The woman flicked a look at Mar and at her jacket and at the ring and didn\u2019t say anything sentimental like You ready. She jerked her head toward the bow.\n\n\u201cYou stand there,\u201d she said. \u201cYou say something when the wind goes dumb. If you got friends, you say their names out loud. Boat likes that.\u201d\n\nThe ring pulsed. The thread hummed itself quiet and then louder. The broom was not visible which was comfort because this was not a room, and brooms like rooms. The key knocked against her thigh like a nervous kid. The tile warmed as if it thought it had become a hand warmer by mistake. What she loved most about her city in that moment was that nothing told her she couldn\u2019t. What she loved least was that everyone was going to watch.\n\nThey pushed off. The boat was small. The river was not. Her wings wanted to come and she told them no. The wind liked commands. It should not be cajoled. She planted her boots and thought about sewing, not because it was cute, but because when you keep two pieces of different behavior together and make them act like one, you need the right thread and the correct amount of patience and a willingness to pull something apart when it lies. The boat cut a wake that felt like a zipper being asked questions. The rain softened at the edges, then bit down again. Lights along the Canadian side blinked a language that was suspicious and neighborly. In the distance, the lift of a freighter\u2019s bulk moved like a thought that had been having itself for days before anyone heard it.\n\nThey passed under a bridge. It breathed above them, the old iron content and sad. You would never know there were people sleeping up in its bones unless you were the kind of person who knew that sort of thing. A gull sat out the storm on a bollard and narrowed its eyes at her with an expression exactly like a city aunt who had decided she liked you but was not to be handled lightly. She said the names she had been told to say: Latrice. Solomon. Delphine. Calendar. Sifa. Micah. Ernestine. Mike. The river shrugged but did not object. Sometimes it is enough.\n\nThe boat nose dipped and rose, dipped and rose, the piston ring singing in her wrist with each up-down, making the water\u2019s movement into a thing her body could claim, not agree to, but incorporate. Ahead, where the river yawns at the lake and has to argue about who it is going to be, Poly had left presents. White snagged where white should not. Foam that did not break. Slicks that smelled like cucumber melon and lies. The line boat\u2019s pilot swore through their cigarette and the men at the lines went quiet in the way men go quiet when they are about to decide to do something stupid and hope it works.\n\n\u201cYou talk to the lake,\u201d the pilot murmured to Mar, not because she believed in fairy girls, but because in the absence of believing, you delegate. \u201cShe\u2019s crankier than the river. She\u2019s old. She\u2019s had husbands. Don\u2019t tell her what to do. Ask her if she remembers being blue.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not flatter her,\u201d Mar said, but she almost smiled because petty keeps you warm. She leaned into the wind and put her palm out toward the darking mouth where the lake breathed, work to do and no patience with anyone who didn\u2019t have hands. The tile warmed to heat like a stove edge not yet safe. She lifted it to her lips again. She let the ring tell her wrist where to hold steady. She took the thread in her other hand and let the end trail into the lake-wet air.\n\n\u201cLake,\u201d she said, once, which is likely a sin. The pilot turned their head slightly and pressed the cigarette to the corner of their lips with a surprising delicacy. \u201cMa\u2019am. Auntie. You who always think you were the one who came up with the sky. I am not asking pretty. I am asking like a person holds a door when her arms are full. My city is learning a bad habit and the bad habit is asking to be a god. Push back. Not on us. On her. On the little rips she makes. Pull her seams. She likes taking. Take her back from us. We ain\u2019t so innocent. We are not. But we put you on t-shirts because we love you, not because we own you. That love is stupid like love should be. Don\u2019t let her make it into anything less than dumb and devout.\u201d\n\nIf the lake laughed, it wasn\u2019t cruel, but it definitely had teeth. The wind turned itself to face her instead of slapping at her side. The freighter\u2019s horn bellowed, and in the horn was the answer you get when a giant says, Fine. The slicks shivered. The white ropes loosened. The water took a breath in which it looked like itself. The rain changed the size of its drops the way a drummer changes sticks.\n\nFrom the slick came Poly\u2019s voice, not in the room this time and not in an ad, but in the place you put the thing you don\u2019t want to admit you like. \u201cYou\u2019re so boring,\u201d she said, and it was affected and it was furious. \u201cYou are going to be late everywhere for the rest of your life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI already am,\u201d Mar yelled into the wind. \u201cI got a city. We don\u2019t do on time.\u201d\n\nThe slick tore into strips, and the strips tore into confetti, and confetti is more annoying than evil if you don\u2019t let it call itself snow. The line boat slid along the outfall and the pilot did something elegant with their hand that made it look like they had never learned to be clumsy. One of the men made a throw with a hook that would have humiliated his high school self if his high school self had seen it. The rope went around a bollard. The boat held. Mar held. The ring cooled such a fraction she might have imagined it. She didn\u2019t care. Poly was in the lake now. Poly was in a place where old things could be asked to remember their old names. The work was still impossible. The work was always still impossible.\n\nShe didn\u2019t see the shape at the far bend, a black block that had made a promise to Detroit that it thought it intended to keep and then forgot. She didn\u2019t notice the small red figure perched up under the bridge stanchion kicking its heels with glee and dread. She didn\u2019t hear the bell start again below, not the one in her, but the one that told the city you have about a minute to decide if you\u2019re lucky. She held the broom you cannot see. She held the thread that wishes to be a road. She said the names she had for water and believed that maybe if she said them enough, they would leave her mouth and go to work when she was sleeping.The bell shivered through the hull in a way that made screws remember the hands that turned them. It wasn\u2019t the polite undercity bell that knocked your ribs and then held its hat. This one was a work bell, a barback\u2019s last call, a bellow from under the sills of the places Detroit had asked to be invisible when she put on her Sunday dress. The pilot cut the motor just enough to make the bow listen. Rain walked sideways for a spell and then fixed its attitude and came down like it had agreed with the river to stop fooling around. The freighter\u2019s horn rolled its vast vowel across the water a second time, and up ahead the black block that had been a shape decided to be a barge shouldered with containers the color of late bills. It hulked in the turn beyond the bridge pilings like a man at the end of a hallway deciding whether to fit.\n\n\u201cLot of iron to have opinions today,\u201d the pilot said, and she spat neatly into the river\u2019s mouth because some conversations you begin with a small honesty. \u201cIf that barge spins, we\u2019re soup. Hold on to your thread and your good names.\u201d\n\nMar kept her boots where they were and pressed her palm against air until the air pressed back. She felt the line of the thread slide along her collarbone and hum when the barge\u2019s bulk bullied the wind into finding new routes. The ring on her wrist settled into a tick that was not the boat\u2019s notch, not the lake\u2019s chop, but the barge\u2019s slow heart. She could hear, in the low drum of it, a tired story of schedules, of a captain who had started this job because his cousin had a line and stayed because the river kept making the same promises in different weather. He didn\u2019t want to be here in the storm. He was here because money has ears. Poly would like that about him, the honest compulsion of it.\n\nThey slid under the bridge again, and this time Mar spoke to it the way you speak to a relative you never call and suddenly need. She told it the names she had in her mouth and asked for the ones it kept in its bolts. The bridge breathed its big breath and told her about women who had come up into its bones with sleeping bags and bad boyfriends and had made a small heaven anyway out of coffee cans and fleece. It told her about a copper thief too clumsy to be good and too stubborn to stop before his third jolt. It told her about a man who had brought his daughter to the top at night to see whether the city still glowed when you weren\u2019t looking. It told her, in the way all such giants do, that it didn\u2019t like liars because lies put cracks in places no mortar can reach. Poly was lying whenever she called herself a home, and the bridge had the right to be offended. When it flexed its shoulders against the wind, she felt the flex in her teeth.\n\nThe first big rope of plastic\u2014Poly\u2019s weave let loose and muscled tall by rain\u2014came sliding out from under the lip of the breakwater like a seal that had learned to grin wolfish. It took a wave in its notch and set itself for the boat, not clever like a predator, just malevolent like a habit with a plan. The two line men swore the way you swear when your hands already know what to do and your mouth is just venting. The pilot feathered the throttle and spun the wheel, and the little boat pulled a trick they don\u2019t put in manuals, not because it cannot be done, but because if you write it down, some idiot will try it on a sunny day. They skipped sideways and the rope hissed past, de-boned by chop and fast contempt into a slick. The smell of cucumber melon puffed up like the worst aunt\u2019s taste in lotion and then got its feelings hurt by lake air.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s using the drains,\u201d one of the men said, not because he could see the city\u2019s gullet from here, but because he was listening as hard as Mar was and he had been taught to say true things out loud. \u201cShe\u2019s up in every gutter with a wrist and she\u2019s making them point. We\u2019ll keep getting these ropes until that bell stops.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t,\u201d Mar said. \u201cNot yet. The bell\u2019s honest. The bell says, decide.\u201d She lifted the thread hand and let the end flag and smack in the wind until it picked up a current you only notice if you are a tailor or in love. The navy line found a direction and she followed it with her palm as if it had a mind older than the spool. It pulled toward the corner where the river\u2019s last breath under the bridge turned into the lake\u2019s first. That corner was where kids shivered their bikes because the wind there always wanted to show off. It was where gulls got cocky. It was where the habit of flow changed just enough for tricksters to practice. Poly liked it because it was the seam. Mar liked it because seams hold.\n\nShe threw her attention the way you throw a lasso if you have never seen a horse. It caught anyway. It caught on a knot in the wind and made a notch in the rain big enough to take a breath. The barge felt the change as a thumb under its chin and straightened its mouth, its captain suddenly deciding to do the thing good pilots do, which is bore, not impress. The pilot on Mar\u2019s boat grunted like an overdue girl and shouted to no one in particular, \u201cThank you! Whoever did that gets my favorite cigarettes,\u201d then looked left and scowled at the slick like she could shame it back into petroleum.\n\nThreads are not made to pull whole rivers, but they are made to guide dress pieces against temper. She let the line slither into the slick, and it colored, not in a banner way, but in a quiet confession. It marked where the plastic thought it could hide. It striped a path where Poly had tightened her grip and the lake had loosened hers. The ring heat came again, that working warmth that wasn\u2019t pain because the body decided not to take offense. The broom wanted a floor, and the lake wanted a story, and Mar wanted a day she could file under Getting Away With It and forget later the way you forget a bruise, interpreting its yellowing as proof of virtue.\n\nThe pilot skimmed the boat alongside the marked slick and the men used the hooks the way you use a safety pin when the zipper betrays you in a church. They snagged, not to own, but to divert. They dragged the slick against its will toward a channel where the current had a clear destination and could be asked, politely and with the correct amount of family pressure, to take the mess toward the booms and the waiting suck of machines that were not perfect and were not useless either. You can love an imperfect machine if it works when you need mercy more than you need ideology.\n\nWater thumped the hull like a drummer who has been told there is no money in it and keeps on anyway. Rain hammered the crown of Mar\u2019s head until her hair gave up and lay down flat like a cat that has decided winter will happen no matter how it feels. She let the tile rest against her lower lip again and the taste of the painted iris steadied the little panicked part of her that kept asking for somebody else to come do it. The lake did not speak as the river does because the lake has the luxury of not needing to convince anyone. It turned its face toward her and held it there until she remembered who she was borrowing the broom from. It was her grandmother\u2019s broom and her city\u2019s broom and the broom of every woman who has ever told a room full of chaos to try again using their inside voices. She pushed without pushing. The slick folded where the thread had colored it and slipped like a tongue back into the mouth it came from, and the mouth was a pump intake that had been fitted with a net by a man who kept to himself and made things right when nobody asked him to.\n\nThey worked as a small weather in a bigger one until working became the only possible proof that they should keep trying. The barge stopped threatening to be a character and obediently chose to be a prop. The bridge sighed in gratitude, and the sigh rattled bolts in three neighborhoods where a boy turned in his sleep, a woman put her head down at her kitchen table and did not cry, and a man decided to leave a thing unsaid that would have started a fight with someone he loved. The slicks broke like promises donated to a charity that knew how to put on a gala and also how to collect trash on Monday. Cucumber melon tried to rise again and got shouted down by peppermint and diesel and the soft good musk of rain in hair.\n\nIt would be pleasing to say that Poly retreated from the lake in a dramatic tantrum, and it would be more honest to say she learned. Mar felt it when the habit changed shape, when Poly stopped insisting on being obvious. The ropes went into crumbs, the crumbs into the kind of bits that no hook can own and no line can persuade. The pumps would eat what the nets could catch, and the rest would keep the new fish learning old mistakes. The old woman of a lake shifted her knee, and the whole river moved as if to keep up its side of an old dance. That was the mercy. The insult was that the dance would always be needed.\n\n\u201cYou bought us a day,\u201d the pilot said without the piety of a thanks and therefore meaning it, and she turned the boat\u2019s nose toward a slice of dock that had never looked so hospitable in such ugly weather. \u201cIf we don\u2019t use it, I will be personally offended. You can stay out and play queen of the spoils or you can get on land and go tell someone with windows what to cover theirs with.\u201d\n\n\u201cWindows,\u201d Mar repeated, and the word did that thing where it became more than language. It became a face on Vernor with dress shadows moving behind it and a pin dish shaped like a turtle and a woman who had taught her that hems hide sins when hemmed properly. It became the glass where boys had pressed their noses the winter Latrice first set a display and made the dresses nod like women at a funeral, polite and full of secrets. It became the smashed pane at the shop two doors down where the baker had nailed up plywood and painted on it a galaxy of donuts with sugar stars. She did not want to leave the water. She was not in charge of wanting.\n\nThey made the dock with the silent diplomacy of people who accept the weather\u2019s overstaying as a fact of a city childhood. The pilot flapped a hand at her and didn\u2019t say be careful because what would be the point. The line men gave her small salutes with their hooks and then turned their attention to the work that would continue in the ordinary way like it always does after magic has lifted the day\u2019s chin and put her back on her feet. When her boots hit the planks, the bell settled itself low again and rapped on bone in that particular rhythm that only the beneath-city keeps, a call and response between pipes and promises.\n\nOn her way up the steps to street, the red boy popped his head out of a gap in the railing and grinned with wet lashes like a kid who knows where the matches are. He had one of those rain jackets that aren\u2019t rain jackets but windbreakers pretending, and water beaded on him like he wasn\u2019t convinced by the weather\u2019s argument. He walked backward up the steps in front of her, delighting in his ability to disobey gravity\u2019s tone of voice.\n\n\u201cYou did not drown,\u201d he announced, which was his way of saying you have not disappointed me yet. \u201cThe bridge didn\u2019t lie and you didn\u2019t either. That big iron had a moment where it considered whether it was tired of being decent, and you sweet-talked it without making it feel like you had.\u201d He leaned toward her without stopping his backwards climb and sniffed in a broad rude way. \u201cLake in your hair. Pumps on your shirt. Peppermint to hide the lie of fruit. Your aunt\u2019s thread under your collar and a tile like a mouth-guard. Cute. Come set a fire with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t set fires for sport,\u201d she said, and even as she said it, the air in the stairwell took on a taste of something scorched that didn\u2019t bother to hide itself. \u201cYou smell like the last day of school. What\u2019s burning and why do you want me to think I can make it better by walking into it?\u201d\n\nHe put his hand out to her with the penny on the center of his palm, the face rubbed off as if he had loved it with his thumb while telling himself he didn\u2019t care. \u201cThey lit three piles at the Packard because someone owed someone and then owed himself worse. It\u2019s not big, not yet. It\u2019s trying to be meaningful and it will end up being sad. Your little trash queen has hands there too. She loves photographers. Come take this and come faster or don\u2019t. I\u2019ll go either way. I like it all.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery time I think I\u2019ve decided to hate you, you pick a thing I already wanted to do,\u201d she said, and she took the penny because pennies liked her and because the ring on her wrist warmed in a way that made the old engine in it clear its throat and say I know that building. \u201cBut I\u2019m not leaving the west side people to choke if the drains quit again. Ernestine\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cErnestine got her hands full and a church van at her back and the long grace of cuss words on her tongue,\u201d he said, quick like gossip, annoyed that she had thought to worry in the same place he had. \u201cShe told the pumps the names of her kids and they\u2019re showing off for her. The lanes are clearing. The little floods will be photo ops. The big one will be at the lake if you stop paying attention. You ain\u2019t going to stop paying attention. We have time. Two hours. Three if the wrong person takes the wrong exit. Come on.\u201d\n\nHe tumbled up the last steps as if he had decided to imitate human exhaustion for comedy. The street above had turned the peculiar gold it turns when the light is about to fail and refuses to admit it. Headlights cut their own wet lanes and made her feel watched and safe in equal measure. She tucked her shoulders and ran, because the city had given her a day and the red boy had given her a place to spend it. The ring sang the up-down in her wrist until the rhythm became almost a tune, and she sang it under her breath to keep from begging the sky for a deal.\n\nWhen she cut past the stadium, the big letters slept under their own power. A small boy in a poncho stomped into a puddle with a zeal that made his mother laugh in a way she would deny later. A bus belched only once and then self-corrected as if embarrassed. On Vernor the baker hammered another nail into the donut galaxy with dignity. She ran by her aunt\u2019s shop and did not go in and did not look and did not think her aunt would be fooled by that for a minute. Latrice had the pin between her teeth and the dress on the form and would have turned her head slightly as if to listen to a weather report in the thread and then told the customer a true sweet lie about the way a train falls.\n\nThe Packard\u2019s bones rose up with that particular sorrowful grandeur people put in their postcards when they want their sadness to be a brand. It brooded along the blocks as if the rain were a little kid tugging on a sleeve. Smoke puffed where it ought not, soft still, worth swatting with a grown hand. The fire department had sent one truck that was already arguing with itself about which entrance to pretend was legal. A handful of people stood with their phones up, trying to translate heat into content. The red boy hopped a puddle and landed with exactly the wrong grace, a small ballerina with three felonies, and he smiled like a window thrown up in a bad room.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d he said, pleased to present her with a mess as a gift, \u201cis where your plastic saint tried to practice absolution. She told someone they were good for cleaning up their neighborhood and then told them what to do with the pile. Portable holiness is a hell of a drug. He set it alight congratulating himself. It will be sixteen cars full of poison if you let it. It will be rainbow if you let it. It will be nothing if you work fast. The cameras are hungry. You going to feed them or the fire.\u201d\n\nMar paused just long enough to meet the eyes of the woman in the turnout gear nearest her, a rectangle of a person with raindrops in her eyebrows and a mouth that had rearranged itself stubbornly to say I will not be thwarted by poor planning. The name on her coat was RUIZ and the lines around her eyes said she had been on shift long enough to owe herself a mean snack as soon as someone with rank remembered she deserved one. Mar liked her instantly and wanted to kiss her forehead and also to follow orders.\n\n\u201cYou know the inside like stairs know,\u201d Mar said to her, because it was true, and because flattery is only useful when it fits the subject like a good suit.\n\n\u201cI know when assholes light tires,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cI also know when plastic smoke gets up under a cloud lid and makes a dome the city can\u2019t breathe under. You with them?\u201d She jerked her chin at the cluster of helmeted heads that had found a hydrant that hadn\u2019t been violated by a metal thief and were now swearing at a wrench.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m with the part that stops the dome,\u201d Mar said. \u201cI can\u2019t promise you art. I can promise you a hole in a cloud big enough to make someone thank God without using his name right.\u201d\n\nRuiz gave her a long look, the kind you give a foolish niece when she says she is not a child and also asks if you have gum. She weighed her options like a chef looking at onions that had tried their best. Then she nodded, once, because you don\u2019t nod more than you need to when the day is trying to get dramatic. She pointed at the shape of a staircase that had been cleaned by ghosts and rain. \u201cUp there. Third bay. Don\u2019t die because I don\u2019t have the forms for it. Take this,\u201d and she shoved into Mar\u2019s hands a respirator with two canisters that made her feel instantly like a useful liar. \u201cIt\u2019s set for someone bigger than you. I don\u2019t mind if it looks like a necklace on you. I need you not sucking death and then preaching at me between coughs.\u201d\n\nThe red boy made a noise in his throat that meant he liked this woman and would steal her lighter if given the chance. He sprinted ahead and his feet did not squeak the way human soles do, and she envied him for exactly one second and then set her boot on the first wet step. The inside of the Packard was exactly how it always is when it is wet and people have recently played at desertion and empire: the sound of water traveling through many levels of memory, the smell of old oil and paper, the way steel sings when asked to wait. She climbed into her planet\u2019s past and felt the bell throw her a rope.\n\nPoly was present, but not in a way the eyes could rescue you from. She was in the ash gray of a plastic tub lid turned char, in the sweet nasty smoke that wants to be barbecue so bad it lies, in the generosity of neighbors who had brought their recycling to one place and felt virtuous for winning a small battle. She rode the habit of ceremony a community makes when it does the right thing on the wrong day because nobody had the nerve to tell them the schedule. She whispered over the scrap the suggestion that it wanted a flame to bless it into air. Mar wanted to slap her. Mar wanted to show everyone two pictures, one of smoke and one of turtles, and turn off all their screens until they cried.\n\nAt the third bay the pile had taken its trial run and found oxygen. The water from the first line hit it and made a hiss that was almost sultry. The heat licked at her face and tried to get behind the mask and got annoyed when it could not. The red boy was already up on a pillar like a saint in a story told naughty. He stretched his fingers toward the fire and the fire reached back, flattered, and he pulled it by its jaw subtly so it opened where he wanted it to. He did not do that for her. He did it because he likes to dance, and fire lets him lead if he feeds it compliments. He glanced down at her with that ugly-beautiful affection and then looked over her shoulder to where the night had been deciding what to call itself.\n\n\u201cLift,\u201d he said in the tone of someone who pretends to be giving advice to go with their popcorn and is actually praying.\n\nShe had the broom, strange in the open air, heavy in a way that made sense to her bones. She took a breath of damp resin and last week\u2019s banana peel and the little whisper of Latrice\u2019s mending soap that had clung to this jacket through rains and options. She lifted the broom and asked it to be a ceiling mover instead of a floor tamer. The shape of the room mattered more than the shape of the fire. The Packard\u2019s ribs still wanted to hold. The fenestrations wanted not to be blamed. She reached with the broom, up not down, and swept the smoke toward the sky with her arm telling the sky, take your unhappiness out back and finish it there. The first sweep made a mouth, a gap in the dome you could kiss with clean air. The second sweep made the mouth into a confession. The third made the smoke remember it always meant to be outside anyway.\n\nRuiz called her something that would sound like an insult in another woman\u2019s mouth and the hose crew changed angle like a couple adjusting mid-dance without losing the song. The smoke took the hint and rushed the breach she had made. The red boy\u2019s fingers twitched and the flame followed obediently to the side where a wall had already fallen once and would not be offended by a second compromise. The bell in her ribs rang again, not a panic but an instruction, and she heard in it the voice of the woman Ernestine had mentioned, the one with the chain of keys that are songs. This was not Ernestine\u2019s domain. This was a place the keys woman only visited when the city wanted to see if she remembered the steps.\n\n\u201cYou hear me,\u201d came the voice, not billowing, not echo, but the sound of someone laying keys down on a table after a night shift and telling the table it did great. \u201cYou big-talking baby, you open a window then tie it back so it don\u2019t slap. This is not your house. This is a ruin with feelings. Mind them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am minding them,\u201d Mar said, and the fireman two floors down who did not believe in fairies and did not need to heard only a girl talking to herself and was comforted by the crash of the roof letting go of a piece it had been negotiating with for two years. She tied the thread to a bent rebar up in the mouth of a window the fire had wanted, and the thread shivered and settled and held open the sky as if it had always been a curtain rope. The smoke poured itself through the circle she\u2019d made and went sulking into the rain where the day shook it cold and the smell resigned itself to being a fact. Down on the floor a bottle of something that had meant well before someone added colorant cracked with a pop and a good portion of the pile stopped pretending and flattened into saturated hush.\n\nPoly did not speak because Poly was busy with hoses down the street and with a church basement where somebody was arguing about whether metal spoons turn soup bitter and with a woman whose hands had closed around the handle of a bag too many times for her circulation to mind anymore. That was a kind of respect that made Mar want to tender her resignation from magic, and she did not have time for that tantrum, so she saved it. She saved it and worked and later her saving would look like cleverness.\n\nWhen she first came down, Ruiz squinted up and saw nothing that would hold up in a budget meeting, which is the perfect amount of miracle. What Ruiz did see was a girl doing a thing with a broom in the rain that made her want to teach her youngest how to do the thing with a broom his grandmother had done. She saw the smoke clear enough to get her crew in and out without needing to learn new names for grief. She saw the red-headed bad luck lean out like a crow and wiggle his fingers at the fire and she yelled at him purely out of principle and he laughed like fireworks that had been threatened by weather and shot off anyway.\n\n\u201cClose it,\u201d called the keys woman with no ceremony when the smoke had made its escape and the wind had found its comfort. \u201cYou don\u2019t leave a city with its shirt open. You make a crack and you stitch it when you\u2019re done, otherwise some fool will come in and make a song of it and then people will believe the song and not their own eyes.\u201d\n\nMar hauled the line and the thread obeyed, reluctant to stop being the hero. She patted the air with the broom, not to erase what she had done, but to smooth it, to thank the room with a sweep that belonged to no human and all grandmothers. She looked down and saw Ruiz\u2019s face split into a grin that made her several years younger and several paychecks richer. Ruiz put two fingers to her helmet brim and then made a circular motion with her hand that meant make a hole there and then another one there and bless you for being handy. She stayed for the other holes because if you read a place\u2019s breath once and teach it to breathe, you owe it a second. She left when the fire turned from headline to ordinary, when the cameras got bored and turned to the man who had lit the pile and wanted someone to explain him to himself.\n\nOut in the rain again, the red boy bounded beside her like the first dog after a divorce. He admired himself in every window they passed and tilted his head to compare his reflection\u2019s timing to his own. She would have smacked him if she had any hand free of thread and ring. Instead she let him talk until his voice stopped being a fire and became a boy\u2019s bragging and then became the thing behind boys\u2019 bragging, the fear he shoos with noise. He feared Poly in a way he did not fear water. He feared habit the way he did not fear wood.\n\n\u201cYou want a thing you can have without paying for it,\u201d he said after a long run of stories about women who could spit farther than he could and men who had learned to strike a match in a hurricane. \u201cYou want me to say she is weak in some place you can stab. She\u2019s not weak. She is only uninterested in things that require sitting alone with feelings. You can\u2019t stab that. You can outlast it. That\u2019s worse for you because you wanted to be clever and now you have to be patient.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could stab you,\u201d she told him in a voice that would pass as dry if the weather had been different. \u201cNot to kill. Just to train.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did that at the river. It went right in.\u201d He touched his sternum and made a face like he liked it. \u201cI am flame. Stab is a compliment. You going to go tell your aunt you are late and then laugh and then cry and then get told to hem a thing? You should. Mortals are how we don\u2019t eat each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a mortal,\u201d she said, and he snorted not because he believed otherwise but because he wished she would stop pretending belief mattered much to elements. He crouched and plucked at his shoelace and the water that had pooled there licked his fingers like an indulgent aunt, then hissed when he shook it off like an insult.\n\nThe rain began to pull away its weight in a slow sulk, leaving behind a city that looked damp and undecided. The bell under everything tapped itself careful and slow, not done, never done, but not yelling for a minute. The day had sprouted night without remembering the in between, and the streetlights flickered into their own version of alertness. between two, a busted one stuttered the rhythm that had sung Mar into the world on Ferry, and she put her fingers against the pole without thinking and felt the old heartbeat come back to meet her suspecting touch. It gave her its yes, a small one, like a nod from the back of a church, not for show, just for agreement.\n\nAt the corner before Vernor, she stopped. She stopped because a smell that was not lake and not fire and not men\u2019s work lifted out of a little storm drain and hooked her by the nostril like a fish. It was cucumber melon, but not the way Poly wore it when she wanted to be pretty. It was cucumber melon like a promise to a baby, sweetened and left too long in the car. It came up from the place where rain meets all the other waters and gets drafted into a system that gives it a job. Poly had not gone. Poly had dropped threads where only people who look wrong ever see them.\n\nErnestine\u2019s keys clinked on the level of her molars. The woman of the chain of keys did not put on a coat to meet her because she didn\u2019t need to. Her voice came up and out and into Mar\u2019s wrists where the ring waited for orders like a dog that had just learned the doorbell. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d Ernestine said. \u201cFive. Not the pretty five. The five that looks like trash trucks and black coffee. We use the day you bought or we wasted it. We\u2019ll take the line boat at dawn while the ones who think they are gods sleep off their own glory. Bring the key. Bring the thread. Bring your aunt\u2019s mean, because you will need to tell three men no and make one boy cry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate making boys cry,\u201d Mar said out loud to the street\u2019s wet glare and then corrected herself because lying to the keys woman is a sin that gets its own hymn. \u201cI don\u2019t hate it. I hate that I have to. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring someone who loves you in a way that makes you better at counting,\u201d Ernestine added, and her laugh came, short as a cough, sweet as the peppermint that cut a cheap bathroom\u2019s soap. \u201cLeave the red fool to guard a pile. He gets bored on boats and I don\u2019t want to listen to a force of nature whine. Your aunt will kill me for telling you both to be awake at that hour. I\u2019m an old woman. I can survive her glare. You, I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d\n\nMar could picture Latrice\u2019s face when she woke her, the way it would arrange itself into amused despair and then into pride worn sideways to keep it from getting any teeth. She smiled without letting her mouth curve overly because the city had given her a minute and she was not about to scare it off. The red boy made a show of sticking a finger in the storm drain and then yelped in satisfaction when a spark bit him and he bit it back. He would keep a pile from relighting with six rude words and a flick. He would steal hotdogs from a firefighter\u2019 grill at three in the morning and feed them to a stray who would then follow him into a story without the dog realizing his soul had been adopted by a nuisance.\n\nAt Latrice\u2019s door, Mar stood outside long enough to watch herself in the glass like a stranger would, the jacket slick and the hair done wrong by rain and the eyes a little too hungry. She thought briefly about going to the under rooms alone and leaving the Council out of it and then she remembered Sifa\u2019s wet eyes and Calendar\u2019s note-taking pride and Mr. Solomon\u2019s brisket voice and Madam Delphine\u2019s rage disguised as etiquette and she knew she would be a dummy if she tried to make herself a myth when she could be a person in a circle. The bell in the shop rang on the second tug the way it always did, consenting. Latrice lifted her head and put the pin in the turtle dish and said, \u201cYou late,\u201d like the weather, and then she looked, and then she let relief move across her face without giving it a speech.\n\n\u201cI burned and drowned and swept and I\u2019m going to sleep in fifteen minutes for forty-five minutes,\u201d Mar said, which is a sentence only a girl in that city could say with no fear of being corrected by the grammar police. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the lake at the mean five. Ernestine says bring your glare and my broom and a flavor of no that sticks.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will take a hat,\u201d Latrice said, because the right hat is a charm and a threat. \u201cYou will eat a thing with eggs in it. You will not take my green threads unless you want to see what it looks like when I choose Poly over you. You will hold still now for nine pins and I will not stab you because your aunt has manners.\u201d\n\nMar held still. She let the pins slide around her and the small prick come when one of them insisted on reminding her that still is a work more than it is a state. She watched her aunt\u2019s hands move in their own language and remembered the day Poly had called her saint like an insult and understood more deeply than she had wanted to that all saints are just people with chores and witnesses. She ate eggs on toast because Latrice pressed the plate into her hands and scolded her into wanting it. She drank water because lake and rain do not count when your aunt is watching. She wrote on a napkin a list she would forget by accident because lists give magic false confidence, and Latrice put it in her pocket anyway and patted it, meaning not the napkin but the girl.\n\n\u201cGo sleep,\u201d her aunt said when she started to gather herself for the foolishness of baths at the wrong hour. \u201cYou smell like nine factories having regrets. It is almost pleasant. You will smell worse two dawns from now if you don\u2019t lose. Bring me what you can\u2019t tell anyone else. You know my ears keep secrets not like jars but like wells. The deepest trick she has is the one where she makes you think fatigue is virtue. Don\u2019t love being tired more than you love being effective.\u201d\n\nMar lay on the little couch in the back room because that was where the dress shop hid its forgiveness, and she put the ring hand on her belly and wrapped the thread around her wrist and put the key under her cheek and the tile in her palm. She fell toward sleep the way water falls toward low places, inevitable, satisfied, and humming. In her dream, the river and the lake and the storm drain and the pump all agreed to speak at once and it was not a cacophony. It was a chord her grandfather might have whistled if he wanted to call her in from the cracked lot on a night when the moon had decided to look like a bottle cap. Somewhere, the red boy stole a blanket and told himself he had been given it. Somewhere, Poly pressed her face against glass as if she were window-shopping the world, and the glass whispered back a thing from its temper the way glass does if you beg it like a child. Somewhere, a bell that was a promise instead of an alarm raised itself to the work of waking a city up easy so the day could get away with something decent.The morning came on like a rumor you didn\u2019t want to believe, sly and insisting in the crack where the blinds didn\u2019t meet. It had that old industrial blue to it, the kind you see in photographs of a city when photographers decide to be honest. Mar woke because her aunt\u2019s hand touched her shoulder once and never twice, and because the ring had been tightening and loosening through the last hour in a rhythm that turned into a thought as soon as she stood up. She was glued to the cushion with heat and rain and the sort of sleep that doesn\u2019t do its job; she peeled herself away and reached for the jacket before her head could tell her other clothes would be less wet. Latrice looked like sleep had let her flirt and then gone home early, hair wrapped and mouth holding back three comments and a blessing. The eggs had become a sandwich and the sandwich was wrapped in wax paper so that when the day tried to argue, it would have to stand in line.\n\n\u201cYou want me to say don\u2019t go,\u201d Latrice said without fooling herself. \u201cYou want me to pretend we live someplace else. We don\u2019t. You want me to tell you what I tell brides with last-minute ideas bigger than their budget: you can have what you want, or you can have what will work, and the difference is you. So. Bacon\u2019s in there because magic eats bacon. Hat\u2019s on the hook. I will be mad if you die and madder if you\u2019re late.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am always late,\u201d Mar said, which was a joke with teeth and a liturgy in this family. She tucked the sandwich in the jacket pocket going left and the tile went pocket right, because certain instincts come down in the blood as if someone had bothered to write them, and the thread settled along her collar like it knew which clavicle had been patient all its life. She took the hat because her aunt had given it the tone of a sacrament and because its brim would insult the rain in exactly the way that felt right. On the way out, she stopped with her hand on the door and swallowed the stupid wish that this would be the kind of day that ends over chess with elders and not under a sky that liked to bite.\n\nVernor in the not-quite morning gave off its particular litany: the truck just a little too early because someone liked his route done by nine, the cat who considered delivery vans an affront to sovereignty, the man unlocking the pawn shop with the down-to-bone caution of someone who has met locks at their worst. Big Mike waited in front of the shop like he had always belonged to the sun-up and had been kindly letting it pretend otherwise. He had traded last night\u2019s hat for a knit cap a niece had made with love and mistakes, and his cooler looked lighter and yet still present in the way drums are when there isn\u2019t a drum anywhere near a room.\n\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t going by yourself to tell a lake what to do,\u201d he said before hello, and she couldn\u2019t argue if she wanted to because he had already started walking like a song leads a parade. He had brought three fishing bells and tied them on a piece of cord that dangled from his big hand. They clacked and yawned in a way that would call something, and today that something deserved to be named. He did not ask for permission to come because men like Big Mike do not need to ask when a city has already stamped approval on their soles.\n\nThey cut south and east along the streets still crisp with truck-breakfasts and middle-aged sneakers. A bus coughed and carried on and a woman on the corner sold coffee from a thermos to men who had left their own kitchens for reasons they were not going to discuss. At the bridge over the tracks, Sifa popped up from the stair down into a daylight no one had requested. She had a backpack that had seen things and two paper bags that smelled like spice in the right direction. Her hair was tied back with ribbon made out of magazine strips and wanting.\n\n\u201cMadam sent me,\u201d she said, not out of breath and proud because all apprentices understand when they have been given a dangerous errand. \u201cFor your pocket. For yours.\u201d She handed Mar a small jar with a screw-top lid that had lavender heads pressed under the glass the way aunties keep summer in tiny prisons. To Mike she gave a thin tin that rattled like seeds. \u201cDon\u2019t eat it unless the day tries to talk you into forgetting what you are calling.\u201d She didn\u2019t explain, and they didn\u2019t ask.\n\nThe river still wore its storm. Clouds sat on it like aunties on bleachers, legs crossed, disapproving of your shortcuts, praising your effort when no one could hear. The line boat bobbed at the dock with the two men from last night and a third who looked as if he had made peace with emergency as a way of life but hadn\u2019t forgiven it. The pilot flicked ash off a cigarette in a practiced arc and jerked her chin at Ernestine, who stood with her keys like a rosary nobody could have. Ernestine had not slept; she had the glow of a woman whose work had been both recognized and insufficient, and she had acquired, somewhere between midnight and now, a new voice in her back pocket that she was keeping for later.\n\n\u201cYou brought a chorus,\u201d she said, appreciative because trouble without accompaniment is just trouble. \u201cWe got forty minutes before the east wind knows we\u2019re trying to be clever. The pumps\u2019ll give us clean pushes if you give them a song. Poly\u2019s been seeding the downspouts while you were dreaming of being competent. She put in her hands where roofs kiss the day. We\u2019ll go lay a line and ask the lake to do the right thing while pretending it wanted to anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s the other?\u201d Big Mike asked, nodding toward the woman sitting on the bollard who wore rain the way some people wear perfume and had a chain of keys that made Ernestine\u2019s look like an ankle bracelet. She was thin and wide at the same time, like a door left open onto a field, her coat an old municipal blue with a patch where a city\u2019s name had been and was now a story. Her hair had been braided and let go and braided again until it had learned the language of focus. Her mouth held the kind of smile you get from being right about something people don\u2019t want you to be right about.\n\n\u201cGeneva,\u201d Ernestine said without adding last names nobody would remember. \u201cShe keeps our doors remembering they\u2019re doors. She don\u2019t like being called queen of nothing, so call her what she asks. Genny, some days. Ma\u2019am if you are messing up. She\u2019s the one taught the under rooms how to throw a bell that wouldn\u2019t break teeth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like names,\u201d Geneva said, and her voice had that floorboard creak that lets you know when a house is about to hold you instead of drop you. \u201cBut I like work more. Get on the boat. Talk less unless what you have got to say can be tied to something. Girl, don\u2019t stare. Those are keys. They open doors and they make noise. Sometimes making noise does more than opening doors.\u201d\n\nThey boarded, and the boat shoved into the river like an apology that covers more than it requires. The east leaned its shoulder against the wind and called the play. The pilot let the motor know she considered it family, and it behaved. Geneva sat with one knee up and one hand curled around the edge of the bench and did not look at the water because she had learned not to give it what it asked for when it asked for too much. Big Mike tied his bells around the cleat and let them jingle themselves into a rhythm that the pumps recognized and then pretended to have invented. Ernestine\u2019s keys chattered with approval the way a grandmother fusses and makes you a sandwich after yelling.\n\nMar stood with her hat brim taking an attitude and her hand out for the air to push against. The ring was already working, calling up the up-down in her wrist, and the thread was humming with that little impatient throaty sound you hear from a singer who knows the choir is about to miss their cue. She didn\u2019t call the broom. Not yet. She wanted her hands open for now, for the thread and the key and the tile and whatever habit the lake was about to throw into her mouth uninvited. Poly was in the current the way sugar is in milk when you stir it with a guilty spoon. She tasted cucumber melon in a whisper that made her think of aisles with too much light, the kind of light that makes a woman feel examined and choose the box with the flower because the flower is a comfort in a cold room.\n\nThey passed the bridge, which still liked them after last night and let them feel it. Geneva laid a palm on the rail and said, not loud, not soft, \u201cYou old liar-catchers. If she tells you she is cleaning, you don\u2019t believe it. If he tells you the wind is his friend, you don\u2019t believe it. You believe in bolts. That\u2019s all I ask.\u201d The bridge liked being told to do small things. Small things you can do forever if you aren\u2019t bored.\n\nOut where the river changes its mind and thinks of being lake, there were the presents Poly had promised: wrinkled white bodies like tire swings in winter, slicks that held together in defense against being noticed, little curls of cellophane that looked for hands. The booms they\u2019d set last night held what they could and were offended by what they could not; the pumps brought their push at a tempo that was slightly faster than dignity and made Ernestine grin despite her training. The pilot did not say anything annoying; she set a line and held it as if she were already remembering the story she was going to tell someone later wherein she was the smallest bit heroic.\n\n\u201cStart with your line,\u201d Geneva said, and there was no ceremony to it because ceremony can stand in the way of the first stitch. Mar pulled the spool\u2019s thread free and tied it to the bit of rail the boat called its center. She let the line flutter until it found the wind that behaved. It went out into the damp like a vein, navy against gray, less a color and more a memory of color. It landed on the water where a wrinkle waited to swallow it and did not drown. Threads have their own buoyancy if you feed them names.\n\n\u201cSay it,\u201d Big Mike urged, and he didn\u2019t mean a magic trick. He meant the thing mothers say when kids stand at the door pretending they are not going to leave their jacket. He meant something useful, not pretty.\n\n\u201cLake St. Clair is listening,\u201d Geneva said to nobody and everybody. \u201cKids are waking. City\u2019s got asphalt hair matted from its bad dreams. We\u2019re asking for a smooth part and a long braid. Not a speech. A practical.\u201d\n\nMar\u2019s mouth wanted a phrase with lace. She gave it a list. \u201cStorm sewer at Bellevue. Downspout at the flower market. The alley behind the diner on Fort with the grease bucket that never keeps its lid. The big mouth at Connors. Every roof that said it was fine and wasn\u2019t and pretended. The red boy\u2019s hands when he\u2019s polite. The boy\u2019s hands at the island holding net and not wanting to. Ernestine\u2019s lever. Mr. Solomon\u2019s knives. The weight of my aunt\u2019s turtles. The old ring that makes the pumps remember when they were new and humble. The bell. The bell says now.\u201d\n\nShe flicked the line toward the widest slick and watched it take like a stitch in a seam you\u2019re trying to lie to. It colored the surface where Poly had tightened her habit and told the lake where to push. The ring heated slow and true, the way a radiator does when old houses figure out whether you deserve warmth. Geneva\u2019s keys weighed down the air and then lightened it, and Ernestine nodded only when she couldn\u2019t help it because the pumps were whistling under their breath and acknowledging the rhythm she had taught them to like. Big Mike took his bells and shook them in a pattern the bell in her ribs recognized as rude on purpose, the kind of rude that wakes a neighbor and reminds him he loves you.\n\nThe first move out of Poly came as a charm. On the skin of the slick, little blossoms kissed themselves into being, the shape of those flowers printed on bags that mean \u201corganic\u201d when what they mean is \u201cstill plastic but with better font.\u201d It was the kind of beauty that gets people to let their guard down right before they eat what isn\u2019t food. The blossoms multiplied as if buttoned down a cardigan left in the dryer too long. They bobbed in the morning like someone had set a wedding on the water. The pilot swore into her cigarette and did not share the wording because the men had work to do and did not need the entertainment.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be charmed,\u201d Geneva said, bored by the trick, which is the only saving grace of people who have seen too many tricks. \u201cPretty ways to kill are still killing. Thread to the outfall. Hello, sweetheart. No, not you. The pipe.\u201d\n\nMar put a palm on the air above the pipe\u2019s mouth as if it were a forehead she wanted to read for gratitude. The key in her pocket knocked once, and she pulled it and held it ready the way you hold a thing you might suddenly need because you have been warned all your life that someday you will need it, as specific as a spoon and as general as being decent. Poly whispered up from the outfall with all the tenderness in the world. Not today, darling, she said with a voice that sat on top of phrases and sold them, I will keep it for you. I will fold it and put it under, I will make it small. You don\u2019t have to look at it. You can sew dresses and sweep floors and drink green soda and feel like a saint. Let me do the ugly while you do the pretty.\n\n\u201cHer mercy smells like locker rooms,\u201d Ernestine muttered. \u201cAnd she\u2019s lying about ugly. Ugly is mine. Let me tell ugly what to do.\u201d\n\nPoly leaned. It showed in the way the pack of blossoms didn\u2019t drift. It showed in the way the slick held together like a stubborn chorus that refused harmony because the leader liked how her voice sounded on its own. Geneva\u2019s hands made a shape in the air that was not any sign Mar knew and all the signs she needed. The keys made that singing clink that has sent children to bed and called lovers to doors forever. Big Mike struck the cooler with his palm in a war rhythm that wasn\u2019t war because you can honor without reenacting. The ring told the pumps now, and they dug in with the sort of volontary that makes machines feel like they have souls. The thread tightened and the slick bowed to it with the insulted shock of someone recognizing the sash around a waist as a leash.\n\n\u201cDoor, not wall,\u201d someone breathed, and it could have been the red boy in a roof gutter, it could have been the bridge, it could have been a woman whose name nobody wrote down who had once held a door open for an entire neighborhood because the heater at the funeral home had died and the church had to pretend to be big enough. Mar opened her palm. She opened a space like she had on the island but larger, not by force, by permission, a widening that invited water to remember how to be a body without being asked to hold too many secrets. The slick broke along three fault lines. Geneva\u2019s keys laughed, a handful of relief. Ernestine whooped a word she was never going to admit to later. The pilot breathed for the first time like a human and not like a statue of herself.\n\nPoly came up because she had to. She came like a billboard being winched up in wrong weather, elegant in a cheap way and furious in a good one. Her dress of bags had gotten an addition, a belt made of six-pack rings cut into daisies and bitter. She floated at an angle that made her look like the cover of a magazine that had done four cover stories on the same problem and then sold ads to the problem. Her shadow cut across the water and even the gulls had to be convinced to accept it.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d she said with that television ease. \u201cYou did makeup in the dark. Cute.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou seeded people\u2019s roofs,\u201d Geneva said, not brightened by banter, annoyed the way professionals are when amateurs try to pretend the mess is a happenstance. \u201cDon\u2019t fast-talk us. Your cousins climb the downspouts when it\u2019s pretty and when it\u2019s a pain. That ain\u2019t new. You\u2019re what\u2019s new. And you\u2019re worse because you make forgetfulness feel like a chant.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople love me,\u201d Poly said with simple savage honesty. \u201cI come when they forget. I come when they\u2019re tired. I come when they mean well and all the bins are full. I come for boys with skinny wrists who have to carry groceries up three flights because their mamas are sleeping after the night shift. I come for aunties who wrap their hair and go to church and collect me neat as handkerchiefs because someday they might be needed. I am a hope. Don\u2019t tell me hope is ugly.\u201d She smiled then with real teeth and it hurt the way truth does when it is misapplied. \u201cAnd you. Little light bulb. You going to keep holding your breath over this? Let me be the deep one.\u201d\n\nBig Mike shook his bells because if sermons were going to happen, he was going to choose the choir. Ernestine didn\u2019t argue because she had a lever under her hand and because arguing with a commercial only makes it louder. Geneva leaned forward and the keys chimed once like a little alarm in the kitchen when a pot almost boils. \u201cYou\u2019re not hope,\u201d she said, patient and damning. \u201cYou\u2019re a trick. Hope takes work. You feel like hope because you feel like not doing the work. When we forget, you phrase the forgetting so it sounds like rest. Rest is not what you are selling.\u201d\n\nPoly tilted her head, made the bags on her shoulders flirt at the wind, let the cucumber melon smell bloom and then die. \u201cYou are old,\u201d she said. \u201cYou talk like someone who used to be paid to scold. These children hate being scolded. They desire to be forgiven in advance. I can do that. Watch. Girl,\u201d and she focused on Mar with sudden intimacy and infinite salesmanship, \u201cyou can\u2019t guard everything, ferry-girl. You are one set of hands. Tie pretty thread to ugly and it\u2019s still ugly. I offer ubiquity. I offer ease. I offer a blanket. Keep your broom. I will keep their guilt.\u201d\n\nIt was almost relief, the way those words slid in and offered to hold something she didn\u2019t want to hold. It came in her mouth and tasted like the first lie you tell yourself: that you will do it later and later will be kinder. The ring cooled in rebuke, or warning, or warning disguised as comfort. The tile warmed. The tile had nothing to sell. It had a picture of an iris done by a hand that had wanted to decorate a day and had achieved it with color that had never once apologized. Mar lifted the tile to her lip and let the paint remind her what dignity feels like when it\u2019s up in your nose and making your eyes water. The wind took her breath and shook it and gave it back.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to define ease,\u201d she said, and it wasn\u2019t clever and it didn\u2019t have to be. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to be a blanket. Blankets get washed. You get thrown away and pretend it\u2019s a ritual. You want ubiquity? You got it. You\u2019re a rash. We can live with a rash. We lived with potholes. We ain\u2019t dying from you because you\u2019re a habit and we know how to break those. It hurts. We got aunties.\u201d\n\nGeneva laughed then, not kind exactly, but approving like a teacher who had planned to wreck your day and then decided you had done enough on your own. Ernestine pulled the lever the way you pull a child out of a street. The pumps hit the little strobe the ring offered them, and the boat\u2019s men threw hooks with a shameful grace. The thread pulled. The slick went where water told it to. Poly\u2019s belt of rings snagged on the line that had no business catching it and did. Big Mike beat the cooler like it owed him rent and then softened his hands and coaxed it into something like a second-line he had never technically learned. The bridge groaned its approval and a gull, as rude as gossip, shat on the shoulder of the water and didn\u2019t look apologetic.\n\nPoly changed shape. She had to. You can\u2019t hold glamour when people treat you like work. She thinned and stretched and let her dress turn to ribbons that the lake smoothed without permission. She reached under the skin of the slick and grabbed at something she thought was hers and came up with the wrong prize: a single bag handle printed with a defunct logo, the red of a store that had done its damage and gone. She hissed, and the sound was less climate and more petty now, the hiss of someone who wanted the right accessory and got a knockoff. Geneva\u2019s keys made a sweet mean noise. Ernestine laughed in a way she had not let herself laugh since the water department put her on salary and told her not to have a personality.\n\n\u201cYou carry that around,\u201d Geneva told Mar, not raising her voice and making the order stick, \u201cand you feel how heavy a little thing gets. You bring it down when we go under again. We\u2019ll nail it to a door and put a saint\u2019s name on it and let people remind themselves why their hands ache. Put that handle where they can see it and call it by its bad name. Habit. Not friend. Not emergency. Habit.\u201d\n\nPoly pressed her lips together because the lake had begun to pull in a way that her dress could not like. She looked farther up the shore, past the boats and the low warehouses and the places where kids on bikes make choices. She looked toward the little storm drains that had given her fingers to wiggle, and the smell of cucumber melon tried a last trickle out of one and then ran into the lavender Ernestine had dusted there like a joke and died. She smiled then, like a woman who has been told she cannot sit in the quiet section and decides to buy the whole library. It had everything to do with menace and nothing to do with power.\n\n\u201cI will go to their kitchens,\u201d she said, sugared and soft as you\u2019d expect a breakfast curse to be. \u201cI will curl under their sinks and call this a stash. I will have their children bring me like church, expectant and regular. I will be their first piece of domestic religion. The ocean is too far. The lake is too big. The sink is right there. I will be there when they turn on the water and when they turn it off and when their eyes get old and when the last thing they carry upstairs is mine. See you under the cabinet, Marlene-with-a-T.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can come under my house if you like,\u201d Eugene\u2014Big Mike felt formally serious all at once\u2014said with a softness that hid a dare. \u201cYou will have to fit past the bleach bottle that never gets used and the steel wool that bites and the old coffee can full of nails that remembers men who cleaned their crushed fingers with spit and didn\u2019t whine. You will get whispered to by garlic and hair and soap. That\u2019s my church. You want to be altar? We\u2019re rough on our saints.\u201d\n\nPoly lifted, bag rattle sharp as a child\u2019s bracelet, looked at the boat and at the line and at the bridge and at the keys and at the men and at the pump building that had been listening to its own name all morning, and then she slid sideways like a person leaving a movie early. She let the slick go slack. She scooped with her hands at two outfalls at once and took their little lies with her. She left the blossoms and the daisies going limp in the deli-cold shade. She did not break. She was not in the business of being broken. She was in the business of coming back where you least wanted her and most expected her and convincing you those were the same.\n\nThe boat bumped back from the seam the way you do after a kiss you need to think about. The pilot put her hand flat on the wheel and let herself mutter a prayer that included the word parking as if God had a lot to do with meters. Ernestine looked at Geneva and Geneva looked at the shore and everyone exhaled in the long on-the-count-of-feelings way that keeps foolishness from having its aftershock. The ring cooled to warm. The tile stayed warm because the water wanted to be remembered. The thread lay wet and satisfied across the rail like a cat that had been useful and expected nobody to notice.\n\n\u201cBring that handle,\u201d Geneva said again, and her laugh had the sound of someone who had figured out how to make shame pay rent without making it bring its friends. \u201cWe put it where people can see. We\u2019re going under because the day will pretend it is over, and that\u2019s when the undercity has its little gossip. We nail the thing to a lintel and we tell the pipes a story that makes them want to be pushy for the right people.\u201d\n\nThey brought the boat to shore and it kissed the dock like it had been flirting with it all along. The men tied the right knots because today was not a day for playing around with improvisation. Big Mike took the bells off the cleat and put them in his pocket for the next blessing that didn\u2019t know it was one. Ernestine slung her keys around and made them settle, and you could swear you saw them settle like a dress when it finds a shoulder it likes. Geneva stood and the water had the nerve to sit up straighter.\n\nThe under steps smelled like storm and stamina. Lavenders had been replaced where they had been spent, little spikes jammed into the mortar like prayers too directly useful to be pretty. They went down with their boots saying the same thing they had said yesterday and forever: I am not enough and I am here. The room at the bottom put on its light like a collar, and the table stepped out of shadow like an old friend who likes his weight.\n\nMr. Solomon had come with a bag because men like him bring something when you invite them even when nobody invited them. Madam Delphine had changed jewelry and kept her scowl, which was simply a way to keep certain realities at bay. Calendar had a pencil stuck behind his ear because he likes props and also had a bruise forming on his jaw that said he had attempted to share too much community with someone who had not consented. Sifa came with cups and did not spill because the city likes her, and you can tell. Joe, the man who used to have a route, stood in the corner putting on a face of someone who is not going to say anything, and he wore it badly.\n\n\u201cYou brought back a thing,\u201d Mr. Solomon said as soon as he saw the handle. \u201cGood. I\u2019m not one for trophies. I am one for when you put a sign up in the kitchen because the kitchen lives with all the lies and deserves one truth on the wall. What does it say, that old print on there? Metro-Mart? I remember them. Came in promising long hours and the end of inconvenience. Left with people\u2019s pensions.\u201d\n\n\u201cHabit,\u201d Madam Delphine said, taking the bag handle as if it were a roast she needed to check for doneness and passing it back without wanting to handle it twice. \u201cWe nail it up and give it a name so nobody can pretend it looks like their favorite aunt. You know I got a white auntie who tucks her bags into a drawer and tells herself it\u2019s collection. You know I love her. You know I will call her anyway. We make it easy to point. You think easy is a swear? Easy is how we survive certain things. Not this. This requires hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can do both,\u201d Geneva said, keys talking in a small tired clatter that meant she had been asked to open too many doors in one morning and had decided to open them anyway. \u201cHard for us. Easy for people who don\u2019t know we are here and don\u2019t owe us. You take that handle and you nail it with Calendar\u2019s dramatic flourish to the lintel over the stairs going up to the dress shop. The city likes a moral where someone puts on pretty and leaves with weight. You nail another over the outfall room at the plant. You nail a third in the museum nobody goes to, the room with the boring plows, because bored people read and then act. Ernestine, I am telling you your business. Forgive me. I like telling people their business.\u201d\n\nErnestine grinned the grin that comes when a king tells you to do what you were going to do and you get to pretend you had to. \u201cWe\u2019ll put a sign by it that says don\u2019t you dare,\u201d she said. \u201cNo, Mike, not in cursive. In block. And we make people take pictures. I am not too proud for humiliations that work.\u201d\n\nMar stood with her ring cooling and the thread relaxing and the tile ready and the key warming and she wanted to sit and she wanted to run and she wanted to be small and she wanted to be terrible. The undercity liked that about her, the warring tensions that meant she was not going to be one thing long enough to be owned by it. The bell was quiet because it had spoken enough and because bells understand scarcity.\n\n\u201cWe are going to the kitchens,\u201d she said, and she could hear Poly whispering yes like she had invented the notion. \u201cNot to steal bags. To put hands in. To tell people what the bags say when they whisper in the dark and ask to become altars. We are not going to shame. We are going to be annoying. We are going to tie thread under sinks without permission like mice and like God. We are going to thank the bins that do their job and correct the ones that think a bin is a mood and not a container. We are going to make it so they get annoyed enough to do the chore because my broom is not going to fit into everybody\u2019s back pocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow you sound like me,\u201d Madam Delphine said with unflattering affection. \u201cHate it. Love it. Here. Put this in your pocket. It\u2019s a list of men you will have to argue with. Don\u2019t say their names out loud. They will show up like Beetlejuice. They all run something. They all think running something is the same as running everything. You cannot fix that. You can use it. Geneva will take you to two houses you think you don\u2019t have the right to knock on. Knock anyway. Being wrong is our work; being corrected is the miracle.\u201d\n\nCalendar scribbled and rearranged his appointment book like a man who has just discovered some dates have feelings. Joe adjusted his hat and took from his inner pocket a little wrapped thing that turned out to be nothing anyone would ever love and everything someone would need. It was a handful of those wire ties they put around bread bags, braided into a bracelet that had been made on purpose and by someone who hated crafts. He slipped it onto Mar\u2019s non-ring wrist with the gravity of a deacon in a different church and the wickedness of a boy who has stolen nothing of value and feels good anyway.\n\n\u201cFor the cabinet,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you stick your hand under where you shouldn\u2019t and something bites because it thinks you don\u2019t belong, you tell it you have a right. This helps. Ain\u2019t magic. Works.\u201d\n\nSifa took Mar\u2019s hand and put two fingers into the space where lines on a palm become confident. \u201cYou are allowed to be hungry,\u201d she said, in case no one had thought to grant this permission today. \u201cEat your auntie\u2019s sandwich. Don\u2019t let magic think it\u2019s more important than bacon.\u201d\n\nThey went up like people who knew that going down had been the easy part. The shop door hugged the first three of them and banged the fourth in a way that meant it loved them all and felt free to show it. Latrice looked at the handle laid on her counter with a face that stunned it into understanding it would be respected but never admired. She picked up three nails because the city always knows where nails are and a hammer that had been a prop until now and put her mouth into a shape that meant, if we do this we are making a promise and if we don\u2019t, I will be unbearable. She nailed the handle over the lintel with the deliberation of someone who has been building altars her whole life whether she admits it or not. She stood back and took the measure of it like a hem, found it short, and added two inches of thread knotted through the handle and around a nail on the other side.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s going to be able to walk under that without thinking about something,\u201d she declared, and when the first customer of the day came in ten minutes later and stopped under the handle and made a face she could not name and then smiled like a person being unreasonably good to her own tomorrow, they knew it had worked the right way.\n\nGeneva took them to two houses whose doors knew her keys. The first belonged to a woman who had six grandchildren in rotation, a fridge with magnets that said reasonable lies, and a collection under the sink that had been sorted by color because she believed selling scrap would save the world if enough people did it twice. Geneva looked at her like she looked at pipes, respectful and stern. Mar got down on the kitchen floor like a child playing at hide and seek and spoke to the bags in the dark, and two of them let themselves be turned into thread without ripping, and the others rustled their objections in a language nobody has the right to call mindless. They tied the line under the sink and did not say anything character-destroying, and the woman stood with her hands on her hips and did not apologize to them for being human, and that was a good fix.\n\nThe second house belonged to a boy with beautiful ears and an angry mother who thought he was trying to be good and made that into an insult because being good costs and she had been told she could not afford extra. Geneva held the boy\u2019s eye and did not look at the mother because she had decided which person she could move with less hurt. Mar tied the line under that sink and put the bread-tie bracelet in the boy\u2019s hand and said as if she were making a doodle, \u201cBefore you throw it away, just count them. Tell yourself you are measuring. If you don\u2019t like the number, call me names. I will not hear them. The number will. It listens much better than I do.\u201d The mother rolled her eyes and then saw the way the thread lay like a road and swallowed a word she was going to hate herself for if she said it.\n\nThey ate the sandwich in the alley between houses, Ernestine standing guard at the mouth like a gargoyle, Big Mike counting syllables with his bells and making them into a verse that might someday join a parade. The red boy surfaced from a basement window with a cat in his arms and a scratch on his face and said, proud and foolish, \u201cShe loved me because I lied to her right,\u201d and Geneva said, \u201cDon\u2019t reward yourself for theft, you little hazard,\u201d and he preened because he thought being scolded by this woman was the top of a mountain.\n\nBy mid-morning the city had shifted into something the rest of the world might call normal if they weren\u2019t paying attention, which mostly they weren\u2019t. Poly was in the cabinets, gentle as a saint, whispering hers. The lake sat in its old chair and refused to be interesting, which was a relief and a sermon. The pumps ran like old men telling you how they used to be athletes. The bridge kept its rot in check out of pride. The council ate bread standing up and decided to use rich butter because they had earned it and because they were petty and bold in equal measure. The bell below stopped tapping only in order to not get ignored.\n\nWhen twilight came that day, which it does even after a morning full of story, the light slid along the face of the city and made all the number five signs flip from jobs done to jobs to be done. Mar scrubbed her arms and put on a dress because the shop needed her to make three women feel not exactly like saints but like whoever they thought saints should be. She used pins without drawing blood and held her mouth the way Latrice had taught her to when she needed hands to listen. Under her skin, the ring kept the old up-down, the engine inside engines, the rhythm that made pumps and hearts and boats and even bells agree on a basic polite. Under the sink, thread lay waiting, and over the door, habit hung nailed and named and not yet ashamed enough to turn back into innocence.\n\nThat night, someplace not far and not near, Poly lay along the flat square of a tenement roof, her plastic crackling in wind that was learning its winter contempt early, and looked at the city without pretending for a second she did not love it. She loved the weakness in it. She loved the want. She loved the part where people walk into stores without bags and then look at cashiers like the cashiers could absolve them. She loved the way little baskets get carried to cars that already hold two dozen sacks, a procession of convenience humming a hymn as wrong as it is catchy. She touched her belt of six-pack daisies and it felt like nothing because it was nothing, and then like everything because it was present, and then like nothing again because the lake had taken away a piece of momentum she thought was permanent.\n\nShe rolled onto her stomach and peered over the lip at a half-hidden courtyard where a woman had hung laundry on lines that had seen better men. The laundry was not pretty, which meant it was virtuous. It had stains and it smelled like soap that had been invented by a woman with opinions about your grandmother. Poly admired it without irony and hated it with a resentment as clean as laundry. She whispered into the gutter she had chosen for her hand, and the gutter whispered back with mouse teeth. She smiled because she was in the business of coming back. She hated the way the broom had made space; she loved the way space made people forget to fill it. She planned to be a habit under the sinks, an accessory in cars, a consolation at parade\u2019s end when candy wrappers lose their purpose. She planned to be patient because being patient is a horror to women like Mar and Geneva and Ernestine and Latrice, and she counted on that horror to help her. She spoke the word ubiquity out loud and let it taste like dust on her tongue, and then she swallowed because swallowing is a power.\n\nSometime after midnight, on Ferry Street under a lamp that had remembered how to be reliable without becoming smug, the red boy sat on a mailbox and opened a pocket notebook that he had stolen and lost and found again and wrote down in careful block letters the thing the bridge had told him about liars. He underlined it twice and drew a flame next to it and then laughed at himself for being trite and then didn\u2019t care because being trite helps cut through noise when you need to scream. He wrote down Mar\u2019s name and put an arrow and wrote brooms and wrote door not wall and he wrote Poly and drew a loop-de-loop and wrote habit and crossed it out and wrote mother and crossed that out too and wrote sales and underlined it until the paper tore and then he smelled smoke where there shouldn\u2019t be any and hopped off the mailbox because nights only love people who move.\n\nThe day put itself to bed on its own eventually, the way you fall asleep in the clothes you wore because you know tomorrow may make you earn even that. In the shop, Latrice turned the sign and counted the pins and put the turtle dish in its exact place and went into the back and lay her cheek on a finished hem and said you are welcome and meant it for the fabric and for the girl and for the city and for herself. Down below, the bell did not ring; it exhaled, which is another sort of ringing, and the pipes, drunk on their own rhythm, told each other jokes that only infrastructure likes. Up above, under sinks, threads lay quiet and the bags whispered laments and lies and secrets and confessions and fairy tales about simplicity and even a few truths because even habits tell on themselves if left too long alone. The lake slept without sleeping and in its not-sleep it dreamed of what it looked like when people reminded it what blue is supposed to mean. The river mouthed names as it always does, the new ones and the old, and among them, tugged along by current and thread, was Mar\u2019s, with the T moving places like a bead that won\u2019t settle where someone crafty wants it to.",

                              "content": "Mar was born under a busted streetlight on Ferry Street, which might have been a joke some other hand had written into the world to see how she took it. The light stuttered and cut out and came back in a heartbeat rhythm, one bright beat for every motor turning along Jefferson and one bright beat for the river shoving itself along to the lake. She liked to think the flicker had been her first lullaby\u2014electric, stubborn. Libre.\n\nShe grew in secret as all fairies grow, not from some flower or cobweb proper but from milkweed floss dredged off a chain-link fence behind an auto-parts store, from the first day the cracked lot sprouted chicory and someone said, I guess that\u2019s Detroit for you, weeds and music. She had wings, sure. Two fine panes of laced glass hid themselves along her shoulder blades like folded receipts. They caught the sun and fussed at the wind and knew when the city\u2019s weather would flip moods fifteen minutes before the weatherman did. When she walked, people didn\u2019t see the wings. People saw a young woman who scraped paint for cash, who ran errands for an aunt who owned a dress shop on Vernor, who drank burners from the corner bodega and never learned to like the taste but liked how it stained her tongue a violent green.\n\nOn mornings when the river breathed out silver and the island wore its mist like borrowed fur, Mar went to Belle Isle and climbed the iron bones of a streetlamp, right where the paint peeled and downy seeds gathered in the seam. From up there, she watched the water and said hello to the muskrats and the cyclists and to the old men who won or lost arguments with themselves over bait. She liked them all because they were always themselves, even when they lied.\n\n\u201cYou gonna fix the light?\u201d Big Mike called that morning with his voice that bent around its own corners. He sat on his cooler like he had centuries. He had skin like a polished conga and a hat with a feather a child had shoved into it two summers ago, which he wore like a crown.\n\n\u201cI am not the light department,\u201d Mar said. She was. Not the city\u2019s, but someone\u2019s. She put her palm to the metal and listened. The bulb flickered to white for an instant and died back. The wiring smelled burnt and old. \u201cBut I hate the way it coughs.\u201d\n\n\u201cCoughing, it is,\u201d Mike said. \u201cYou hear them drums last night?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich them?\u201d Mar knew the answer. Lovers, drummers, engines, ghosts. Every block, a rhythm.\n\n\u201cAll of them.\u201d He gestured as if showing her a menu. \u201cHold up. Watch that gull. Your thief friend is back.\u201d\n\nThe thief\u2014gull, or kid, or rumor\u2014was a boy about eight who had a backpack too big and pride big enough to match. He came three mornings a week and dipped his net into the water where the shadows of fish made promises. The backpack bulged, not with fish but with the things people threw away along the shore. Bottles. Rusted rings. Once, a broken carburetor, which he had lugged home like a trophy. This morning the boy was already knee-deep, water smacking his shins, shoes soaked. A white bag clung to his calf as if it wanted him to float. He laughed, shook it off, and got another around his other leg. Those bags weren\u2019t right. They moved like fish. They moved like they were moving themselves.\n\nMar\u2019s palm cooled. She felt the change like a note out of key. What had been wind shifted, not just the air but the quality of it. The bags clung and crawled. Big Mike\u2019s laugh canceled in his throat.\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d Mar called. \u201cGet out of there, little man. Now.\u201d\n\nThe boy rolled his eyes the way all eight-year-olds in the presence of someone telling them something they already knew do. He tried to step, but the water yanked his knee the wrong direction, and the bags climbed him with a sound like crinkling foil. Plastic covered his shins, his thighs, each piece seating itself with a soft pop. A supermarket logo smiled where his kneecap should be\u2014a cherry-red grin, Eat Fresh!\u2014and then it slid, tightened.\n\nMar\u2019s wings broke the air without asking her first. They shoved out of their folded places, something inside her saying Yes from a bone place and a blood place and the place where the city had always been running under the city. The blast of wind rippled the river in furrows and almost knocked Mike off his cooler. The boy went down up to his belly and the bags bobbed. The river took one bag and tugged another and then more were there from nowhere, a storm of white and clear and pale blue. She hadn\u2019t seen a storm like this except in co-opsters\u2019 warnings and fishermen\u2019s curses\u2014the way the bags gathered in one place, as if remembering how to hunt.\n\nShe jumped. The lamp\u2019s rust scraped her palms in a familiar breaking way, but the air held her. She didn\u2019t fly like a hummingbird. She flew like a city moving itself along a map, like pothole to pothole is a perfectly acceptable road. Her wings beat, a hush more than a buzz, and she slid low over the river and put her hands into the mess. She could hear the bags whisper\u2014talk, not talk. A woman\u2019s voice beyond the crinkle, sweet as sugar wrappers. Don\u2019t fuss, honey. Just breathe easy. Let me keep you.\n\nShe grabbed the nearest bag and it tried to get slick and get gone. She closed her fingers harder and felt it tear. The sound was three summers of cherry fireworks on the river, not so much a bang as a decision. She tore more. She made for the boy\u2019s legs and ripped, rip-splintered those pretty store logos into streamers. She wasn\u2019t alone. Mike was in the water up to his shins before anyone could yell at him not to be. He took the boy under the arms and lifted; the boy came free with a sucking sound and a gasp that had a laugh clipped to it by fear.\n\n\u201cGot you,\u201d Mike told him, which was how blessings sounded.\n\nOn the air, that other voice cooed again. So many bags, honey. There\u2019s always more. It wasn\u2019t just the bags. Mar looked up and saw her. A girl hovering a dozen feet off the island path, backlit by sun and lamp. Big, not big. She looked human as Mar did, but there was too much there, too much shine on the cheap. Her dress was knotted from grocery bags, layers and layers, a rainbow of oil-sheens. The bags rustled as if a thousand hands were twisting handles around fingers. Every rustle, a laugh.\n\n\u201cHello there,\u201d the girl sang. She moved one hand like she was unsnagging hair from her ring. The river swarmed with more white. \u201cYou\u2019ve got nice wings, babe. That\u2019s cute.\u201d\n\nMar\u2019s wings went tight along her back. She wanted to say a dozen things. She managed one. \u201cThose bags aren\u2019t you. You got no right.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, everything\u2019s me now.\u201d The girl\u2019s voice did an old-time TV switch, nice to news anchor to talk show to lullaby. She drifted closer. Her eyes were the flat reflective of a deli case. She smiled and it sounded. \u201cName\u2019s Poly. You can call me Poli if you want it short, but I like the long one. Pulls on the tongue.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolly like a parrot?\u201d Mike shouted. \u201cYou repeat what others say? Returns policy? Trash bag? Girl, go home.\u201d\n\nThe girl laughed. Every bag on her dress laughed too. The sound came back from the water; two gulls overhead screamed and veered away. \u201cPolycarpella,\u201d she said sweetly. \u201cSince you\u2019re curious. Perhaps your friends read Wal-Mart receipts. We\u2019re all made of names. Hey, little hero. You smell like\u2014what do you smell like? Mmmmm.\u201d She sniffed in Mar\u2019s direction, then rolled the word in her mouth. \u201cOzone and dandelion. Downtown dirt. Choir practice. They sent you up out of that old light, didn\u2019t they? Ferry Street little saint.\u201d\n\nMar had no light to send. She had a boy sputtering water on the ground, and Mike steady, and a little crowd who had turned toward what looked like a fight without knowing what they were looking at. The bags in the river mouthed around the rocks and branches with a fish\u2019s determined aim. Mar\u2019s belly went cold, and then it went angry.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know where I came from,\u201d Mar said. She lifted her hand. Her fingers stung with the river and with whatever the bags were cut from, some sleepiness that felt good in the very bad way. Her body wanted to lean into it. She refused. \u201cYou want to know where you\u2019re going.\u201d\n\nPoly cocked her head, listening to an invisible earpiece. \u201cOh, we\u2019re going everywhere. Every breath. It takes one lifetime to float around the world and back again. Ask the turtles. Ask the kids. Ask the grandmothers who wrap their hair up nights and save those bags under the sink because you never know. Ask Lake Erie what\u2019s in it now. Ask your light. It\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\n\nThe lamp hummed behind Mar like a throat clearing. She whispered to it, not so loud anyone heard, remember what I did to that breaker near the conservatory? Do that. The lamp gave a little agreeable buzz. She took a breath. The city air around her tasted like exhaust and hope. She put breath through her teeth and made a note like her aunt did when she pulled thread through something stubborn. The note was not a song. It was a decision shaped like a sound.\n\nAir flexed. The bags flapped inward, toward Poly\u2019s dress. The river\u2019s face changed. The hanging shreds that had been climbing the boy a heartbeat before lost their will and went slack and drifted off like sea jellies. Micah\u2014Mar didn\u2019t know his name, but she would\u2014clutched Mike with all his little strength and cried and cried because he wasn\u2019t drowning.\n\n\u201cYou think that\u2019s cute?\u201d Poly\u2019s smile changed like a store sign flickering from OPEN to sorry about it, NO. \u201cStealing from me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think those were yours?\u201d Mar said. She didn\u2019t look like much: a normal woman in old boots, an okay haircut, a jacket with pins her aunt had made out of bottle caps. A whole river looked like it was listening to her, and she tried not to notice. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s cute, too.\u201d Poly shook her shoulders and her bags whispered their thousand whispers. More wind. More white in the air like it was snow. \u201cBut we\u2019re fighting. Because when you think you\u2019re a hero, you can\u2019t help yourself. You\u2019ll keep touching my things.\u201d\n\nMar let herself drop. She landed light, knees easy. Mike had the boy by the shoulders and the kid was breathing. The crowd had their phones out now. They didn\u2019t get the focus right\u2014the river moved too much to catch a bag in the act. Someone had a pit bull on a rope and it barked until its voice went hoarse. The three girls who came to the island to Yin-yang their mouths with vape and sing, stopped mid-warble. The park policeman, the good one, looked worried in a way that meant he\u2019d call someone who\u2019d understand.\n\nThe bags made vortices, slow and purposeful, and turned the water into a slow-speed blender. The city felt it. The lamp to Mar\u2019s right flickered the way it did when the Tigers won a game downtown. The pumps under the island coughed. The storm drains muttered wake up. She could taste the metal shapes of their mouths.\n\n\u201cDo it then,\u201d Polycarpella said in her sugar voice. \u201cLift your little hand. It\u2019s a good trick when the breeze is with you. But what about when it isn\u2019t?\u201d\n\nBehind Poly, beyond the white swirl and the hard sun, the skyline squinted up. Glass and steel and brick made all the ways a city can be a mouth. It breathed in. It breathed out, this thing they all lived inside. Mar held out her hand because it wanted to be out there. The air pushed against her palm like a dog.\n\n\u201cGo away,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Poly.\n\nThe bags came down in a crown around Mar and Mike and the boy. It was a clever move: a shrug that turned into a net and then into a fist. Mar heard Mike make a sound like the start of a prayer that hadn\u2019t yet figured out if it would be polite. She heard the boy\u2019s breath come light and catching, like a music box that had been left out in a storm. She heard something else too. A bell.\n\nShe hadn\u2019t heard that bell since the summer she got caught in the Packard ruins and the bums, the lean ones with dust on their eyelashes, traded her safe passage for a story. It was the bell that rang, not in a church, but in the trapdoor of the city\u2019s belly. It said: you\u2019re late.\n\nAuntie Latrice had told her about it. \u201cThat bell,\u201d her aunt had said, eyes on her needle, \u201cis what happens when the city decides you\u2019re in its business. It\u2019s the knock on your ribs and the knock on your door. Get a broom.\u201d\n\nHer hand moved the way it had moved when she was five and sweeping the dress shop floor. She made the broom out of nothing. Or out of everything. Out of her mother\u2019s laugh she barely remembered, out of the engine-turning chug of late buses, out of the breath you take before you lie, out of the breath you take before you tell the truth. It was a broom you couldn't point your phone at, because it didn\u2019t sit still enough to be seen. She took that broom and she swept.\n\nThe bags skittered. You can sweep water. It never looks right, but you can. The surface makes a face and says excuse me? and you do it anyway. The sweep made a clear place where Mike could carry the boy out of the dimpled shallows. It made a path for the bark-girl\u2019s dog to bolt along to its owner. It made Poly blink.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Poly said, almost delighted. \u201cChores.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo home,\u201d Mar told her again.\n\n\u201cI am home. Everywhere\u2019s home, babe.\u201d She drifted away an inch, like a waitress taking a second step when she hadn\u2019t even had a first. \u201cDon\u2019t make this more than it has to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what does it have to be?\u201d Mar said. The broom dissolved. She missed it in her hand and then didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cA wave,\u201d Poly said, all teeth. \u201cAnd a hand. Yours down. Mine up.\u201d\n\nShe lifted. The bags lifted with her. The river took a funny breath again. The stacks downriver exhaled a greenish smoke no one would be able to explain later except to say, it was Tuesday and the wind was east. The girl was going to throw something. Mar\u2019s throat felt salt-scratchy. She steadied, and found the low place in the day where a voice would fit. She did not yet call in the Birmingham or the grid or the memory of the winter they\u2019d had to walk over the Woodward bridge because the buses were stopped. She simply let the lamp\u2019s hum run through her. She let her wings unfurl and decided as much as she could decide.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who collects things,\u201d she said, and she pulled.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a big pull, not the way big pulls are measured in auditorium applause or Richter scales. But it pulled through every thread in her jacket, and through every little brace in the lamp, and through the squirrel the size of a cheap burger that had been watching and saying in squirrel language, is that my business? It dragged through the old Cold Wave on the ground across from the flowerbeds, through the cracked asphalt smoothies, through the river\u2019s wish to be quiet, through the boy\u2019s wish never to see a bag again. It made air where there had been no air, and that air ran its hands into the piles that Poly held.\n\nIt made space, in other words. Poly wasn\u2019t ready for that. Some people never are, when you give them space and they think you\u2019re going to give them pressure. The bags flew apart and sailed up like frightened pigeons. They hung there, waiting for orders. None came.\n\n\u201cCute,\u201d Poly whispered, and now there was something else in her voice. A long mile of something. \u201cYou think space is a thing you can own? Space takes things. Space swallows oceans. Space swallows kids. You go on now with your little broom. We\u2019ll talk again.\u201d\n\nShe turned in the lazy way of someone exiting a slow elevator. The bags folded along with her. She rose, higher than the lamp and higher than the Conservatory\u2019s glass. The sun got in her hair and made each thin film look preposterously holy. Then she was gone in that way only people like them can be gone, which is both away and also on your shoulder all day, telling secrets.\n\nThe crowd\u2019s phones went back to being phones and arguments and plans. The policeman made the kind of note that will end up as a weird story he tells at a cookout. The boy was breathing. Mike turned to Mar with his face saying everything words don\u2019t get paid enough to say. \u201cYou, baby girl,\u201d he said, \u201care going to be late for your aunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have Aunt,\u201d she lied. Latrice would hum at her the way the lamp had hummed, but with more guilt. \u201cI never told her what time I\u2019d be in.\u201d\n\n\u201cBet you she told you,\u201d Mike said. The boy coughed water and the cough turned into hiccups. \u201cYou ever gonna tell me your real-true name? Not the one with the short edges.\u201d\n\nShe thought about waiting. She thought about being a myth at the river. She thought about the way Poly had said her Ferry Street little saint. \u201cMarlene,\u201d she said. \u201cMarlene T. Some people say Mar. Don\u2019t ask what the T stands for. It changes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, Mar-with-a-T,\u201d Mike said, feeling out the taste of it. \u201cTake a day off. You look like you just met somebody you not going to forget. And keep that broom on you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t fit in my backpack.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake a new one,\u201d he said, and patted the boy\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCan we get you some pancakes, young sir? Make this morning drag a little sweetness over the top of itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo pancakes have bags?\u201d the boy asked, hiccups stabbing the words.\n\n\u201cThey do not,\u201d Mike lied. \u201cOnly butter. Only plates. Only us.\u201d\n\nThis would have been where a normal day let itself. Mar walked the paths and stopped to watch a fox melt into a clump of cattails and, because Latrice was right and the world was full of the wrong kind of magic if you weren\u2019t paying attention, tripped on nothing and swore. She took the bridge and let the cars hum under her feet and didn\u2019t take out her phone to call anyone because she needed to keep the taste of Poly\u2019s voice in her mouth until she could figure out what it was. She would call later. She would explain what needed explaining. She would tell Latrice. She would not tell the others yet, though she ought to. The Council would want to know.\n\nOn her way off the island, she passed a sign someone had smashed and someone else had repaired with duct tape. The tape was silver as a pan of coins. She rubbed a knuckle across it to smooth the air out from under. The tape wanted to peel back. It didn\u2019t get to.\n\nThe city stripped off its island clothes and put on its street clothes as she moved north and west. The stadium lights were sleeping, and the gardens people had built in the rubble looked like foreshadowing. Mar walked, not because the bus would be late, but because walking let the day lay itself out in front of her the way you lay pattern pieces out on cloth. Later would be cut and pinned and stitched. Now was chalk marks and the soft whup of scissors.\n\nLatrice\u2019s shop sat on Vernor, just at the corner where you could smell dough rising. Lace & Grit, the window said in looping paint that had been painted by a cousin who made signs and opinions. Inside the dresses hung in a row like candles. Outside the brick held onto last summer\u2019s heat even now. Auntie was at the counter arguing with a button.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re back,\u201d she said without looking up. \u201cYou look like a storm. I can\u2019t use a storm. I can use a breeze. You a breeze?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to be.\u201d Mar sat on the stool and let her back learn to be back in her skin. You couldn\u2019t bring wings to the counter. Her shoulders ached with the pretense. \u201cYou ever hear somebody call herself Polycarpella?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike the saints,\u201d Latrice said, and the needle went in and out like something that could save your life if you let it. \u201cWe had three Carols and two Josephs today. The names in this city are not embarrassed to repeat themselves. Why?\u201d\n\nMar told her. Not all. But enough. The way the bags had behaved. The way the girl had made them sing. The way the river had looked at her with its lid half down and said, well? The broom, a little, until she felt foolish. The way the voice had gotten in her throat like a sugar chunk. The way the bell had rung.\n\nLatrice listened until the listening was a big thing. She set her needle down when it would not drop thread forever and turned slowly so her eyes could see Mar\u2019s face. \u201cYou felt it,\u201d she said finally. \u201cLike when we had the blackout.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe blackout was beer and candles and arguing over whether to open the fridge,\u201d Mar said. \u201cThis was\u2014this was a program coming on I didn\u2019t order.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d Latrice said, and her laugh dried up in her mouth. \u201cI suspect the Council has some say on whether you continue to be cheerfully ignorant. In fact I suspect they always had plans to stop letting you pretend.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go down there yet.\u201d They had danced rooms under the city like a ballroom you only found by walking wrong. Someone had told her, when she was little and had snuck into her aunt\u2019s meetings, that the city two inches under your feet is older and more yes than the city you can see. She believed that. She didn\u2019t want to go there and be told who she was in a room with poor air.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in it whether you go in the room,\u201d Latrice said. \u201cAnd you know it. That bag-girl\u2014she\u2019s nothing small. I\u2019ve heard rumors. She\u2019s got tricks. She likes to call herself mother to the unwanted. She\u2019s the one who makes people feel good when they forget their reusable totes and need to not care. People like her, because caring is a job we are all tired of.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what are we doing,\u201d Mar said, and the words ran out beyond the edge of her patience. \u201cStand behind this counter till maybe the last lake chokes and the last bird coughs? Sew pretty, watch sad?\u201d\n\n\u201cI make wedding dresses, baby,\u201d Latrice said, and the needle jumped into her hand like a fish into a net. \u201cI make people look like the way they want to remember themselves. That ain\u2019t nothing. But I hear you. So you go down there. Tell them what you showed me. They already know about the bags. We all know about the bags. What they don\u2019t know is what you can do with a broom you can\u2019t hold.\u201d\n\nMar looked at her aunt\u2019s hands. They were hands that could catch glass and tell it a story and make it soft. She put her own palms flat on the counter the way her grandmother had done when she decided on a punishment that sounded like a blessing. \u201cI go,\u201d she said, and didn\u2019t like her own voice. It sounded like someone actress-playing her. \u201cBut if they tell me I have a destiny, I\u2019m going to laugh and then cry. And then\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will tell you. You laugh. You cry. Then you take your jacket and you go do it.\u201d Latrice had been soft for a long time, and sometimes that softness hid steel that would not bend for anybody. \u201cYou think the rest of us didn\u2019t get told things? It\u2019s just your turn.\u201d\n\nThe bell on the door rang. It never rang on the first tug. It rang twice like it had been persuaded. Joe\u2014the mailman who was not a mailman anymore but made his rounds anyway because the walking kept his knees working\u2014waved his hat at them and set a box on the counter. It was butcher-papered and tied with string and had a grease mark on one corner. For Lytrice, the scrawl said, which is how the world spelled Latrice when it felt like it.\n\n\u201cFor the girl,\u201d Joe said. \u201cFrom the Packard. And don\u2019t you go unwrapping that without me watching. I like the sound of surprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat girl,\u201d Latrice said, but she was smiling. Joe always knew more than he would ever say.\n\nMar undid the string and the paper fell away like a thing that was happy to be rid of itself. Inside lay a circle. Steel, but not new, and etched with lines like the memory of a map. It was a piston ring, the kind a man might have gone without lunch to buy, back when the factory made engines like the city made songs. The ring was not just a ring. Runes went around it, not from other countries but from here. Fence post. Chimney. Stoop. Neon. Rye bread. Skylight. This is how you talk to a thing when you need it to answer you later.\n\nJoe whistled a note that sounded like the river did under the wrong moon. \u201cThat down-below\u2019s for you,\u201d he said. \u201cTold me to tell you, \u2018don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s already yours.\u2019\u201d He scratched his chin. \u201cYou better go give a hello to the council before they get nervy. I don\u2019t like them when they\u2019re nervy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re always nervy,\u201d Latrice said.\n\n\u201cThen more so.\u201d Joe saluted his hat brim. \u201cAnd wear the thing. Looks like a bracelet. Someone always wanted you dressed for it.\u201d\n\nMar slid the piston ring on her wrist. It didn\u2019t fit. It did. It was heavy, and then it warmed, like exactly the weight she\u2019d been waiting to set down. She could feel in it the memory of being quite busy. Thousands upon thousands of up and down strokes. Heat and friction and oil and songs on the line. For a second, a naked second that made her blink, she heard her grandfather cough. She had never known him. She had known his cough, though, from the way Latrice said it in the kitchen sometimes by accident. It was a good cough, as coughs go. Not mean. Worked too hard, died too early. The cough said: do right.\n\n\u201cGo,\u201d Latrice said. \u201cTell them what you saw. Then come back and pin this hem. You promised Mrs. Hernandez we\u2019d have her looking like a very particular dove.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t promise her. You did.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy birth and bad luck, we\u2019re the same.\u201d\n\nThe day had turned into the kind of afternoon where the heat pawed everything a few times before it lay down in the doorway. Mar took the alley. Alleys are where the city keeps its secrets breathable. She let her shoulders loosen. She let her wings unfurl just an inch in the warm shadow. Then she went into the place where the underneath had made a door out of a manhole cover. The manhole said City The Detroit Water & Sewerage Department, if you asked it out loud. If you asked it the other way, with your palm and your temple bone, it said Hello again, girl. Watch your head.\n\nShe went down. You\u2019d think it would be wet and smell like rot. It smelled like iron and lavender. Somebody always laid dried lavender along the steps, a little spike in each seam. The walls were brick that had been laid by the hands of people who never had a day off in a row. The steps went in a long slow curve, not scary-curvy. The kind of curve your grandmother takes when she\u2019s telling a story and stops to add in something the story needed all along. Mar\u2019s shoes made a nice sound on the treads. She held the bracelet with her fingers and let it be her nerve.\n\nThey were all there at the bottom, as if they'd known she would show up. They had, of course. The city talks. The city doesn\u2019t always talk fast, but it talks.\n\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d said Mr. Solomon, who ran the deli that had never had a sign and didn\u2019t need it. He had a clean apron on, which meant someone else was slicing his corned beef. He had eyes like his city\u2014tired but spry. He put his hand on Mar\u2019s shoulder like he had a right.\n\n\u201cYou do not run this room,\u201d said Madam Delphine, who actually did not either. But she had a voice like a painted door. Her hair was the kind of white that happens when black gets tired of being angry. The ring on her middle finger had a chip in it that used to be a diamond and then had the decency to be a story instead. \u201cSit down, Marlene with a T. We\u2019ve been arguing over your snack like old fools.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like when we argue,\u201d said a man in a suit four sizes too big who went by Calendar. He kept track of things like who had said what first. He turned the wrong page any time the conversation needed to go a day forward by force. He winked at Mar with a practiced beauty that would have gotten him money once and got him information now.\n\nMar sat. The table was round as a hubcap and as old as chalk lines. On it, someone had carved a compass, and the compass had been worn smooth by all the times people\u2019s elbows and ideas had leaned there. A girl younger than Mar brought tea. Her name was Sifa and she had hair like a halo of apologies she didn\u2019t owe anyone.\n\n\u201cTell it,\u201d Madam Delphine said, and her voice had lost its right hand and found its left. That\u2019s as close to gentle as she got.\n\nSo she told it. How the bags moved like they had a mother. How the river made a hurry it shouldn\u2019t have made. How the voice moved like advertising through her head. How she made a broom out of air. How she made a space. How Poly had smiled like good TV.\n\nThey listened the way the long streets listen when you walk them after midnight. They didn\u2019t interrupt a lot. Mr. Solomon said \u201cah\u201d twice. Calendar said \u201cmm\u201d without meaning to. Sifa\u2019s eyes got wet when Mar talked about the boy. Madam Delphine\u2019s hand tapped a little with her ring on the wood.\n\n\u201cPolycarpella,\u201d Mr. Solomon said when she finished. \u201cI knew one once. We all did. We didn\u2019t call her that then. She had three names and none of them stuck. Used people\u2019s waste for her hair ties, even then. She liked the feeling of usefulness without being useful. Dangerous, that. She\u2019s found her power. We knew somebody would. The bags are too many not to make a god.\u201d\n\n\u201cA goddess,\u201d Calendar said, for the notes. \u201cShe be wearing them like a peacock, now. I\u2019ve heard about it around the lake. Cleveland got a slice. Toledo got bit. Sarnia had a little teeth to it too.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a fairy,\u201d Mar said. \u201cNot a god. She knows how to be us.\u201d\n\n\u201cFairies become gods all the time if people keep looking at them while they eat.\u201d Madam Delphine scowled at no one and at Mar, because Mar was nearest. \u201cBut yes, what is she? Not the river. Not the bags, exactly. The wanting, maybe. The we-won\u2019t-be-bothered. The body water cannot digest that says, me me me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what she thinks she is,\u201d Mar said, and felt the way that made her sound. \u201cShe can\u2019t do that. Not in our river. Not in my city. Not with the kid.\u201d\n\nCalendar huffed. \u201cA hero enters,\u201d he murmured. \u201cFate holds her scarf up in the wind.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop it,\u201d Mar said. \u201cStop making it pretty.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be ugly,\u201d Madam Delphine said with the tenderness of a teacher pointing out where the scissors will cut. \u201cLook at me. It will be ugly and it will not turn into an Instagram anything. That boy will dream of white for months. His mother will have a panic every time he bathes. She\u2019ll say it was just garbage and then she will cry when the light is off. And if you lose, if we lose, there will be a rain one day that does not end, and the rain will be clear and full of hands. The turtles will learn nothing but sleep. The city will make a new smell for us, and we will say it is someone else\u2019s smell. Look. At. Me. You already looked, I know. But I am your aunt, and all of us are your aunt today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have an aunt,\u201d Mar said, but she understood. \u201cSo what do we do? What do you tell me I have to do? What\u2019s next?\u201d\n\nMr. Solomon gestured for Sifa to bring the plate. She did. It had three things on it. A spool of thread the color of the Detroit Tigers\u2019 hats. A key that opened a trap door in a church no one used anymore but the pigeons. A piece of blue tile with an iris painted on it from when the station had been nice to itself. \u201cTools,\u201d he said. \u201cWe always start there. And a story.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat story,\u201d Mar said, and she was tired of stories. Stories stole time. Stories saved people. She didn\u2019t get to be unfair to them for long.\n\n\u201cThe one the city told the day they built the street you were born on,\u201d Calendar said. He loved this part. \u201cFerry Street. You know what ferries do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey carry and they pay the price,\u201d Madam Delphine said. \u201cYou do not get a name like that by falling out of a summer window. Your mama heard it in the light. You were born where the broken-glass light is because all lit things break and keep being lit anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t a strategy,\u201d Mar said.\n\n\u201cTake the spool,\u201d Mr. Solomon said, and his voice made God think about brisket. \u201cIt will hold not just in your hand. Tie what you make to something you cannot explain. Take the key. There will be places you think you need to kick. Keys are faster. And the tile. Put it in your mouth if you need to. It remembers water behaving itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a ring,\u201d Mar said, and showed her wrist. Mr. Solomon\u2019s eyes softened. Madam Delphine actually smiled, but sideways like it could be misinterpreted as sympathy. \u201cIt\u2019s my granddaddy\u2019s. That\u2019s what it smells like.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will heat when you need more and cool when you need less,\u201d Madam Delphine said. \u201cYou will bring the broom when you get flanked. Find the place in anything that says, let me through. Find it. Stop asking if you are allowed.\u201d\n\nMar looked around the circle and felt their old fear bunched with their old hope. She hated both because they were so lazy. She loved both because without them no one ever did anything. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll go back to the river at the time the bags like best. I\u2019ll find her. I will make her explain. And if she won\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not threaten,\u201d Mr. Solomon said. \u201cDon\u2019t ever tell the water what it will do. It will remind you. Go as you, not as a soldier. She will mistake you for small. That is when you move.\u201d\n\nShe left with the ring snug like a small good curse around her wrist and the spool and key and tile was in her pocket. When she got to the street, the afternoon had become a story that included thunder at the edges. She walked back toward the river because it seemed best to walk. She passed the mural of the girl with wings that had been painted by a kid with a can who had never met a fairy and had gotten it right anyway. She touched the brick under the paint and the paint under the brick. She passed the school whose windows were open in deliberate August and the scent of markers and a teacher\u2019s desperation fell onto the sidewalk in waves. She stepped over a little waterfall of pop bottles that someone\u2019s cousin had kicked aside to make a path to the bus stop bench.\n\nThe bags were not there yet but their cousins were: wrapper-birds pecking at corners, a plastic ribbon trying to be a snake. Mar knelt and picked up three things she could put in the bin without making it a religion. She tied the spool\u2019s end to the railing and let the rest of the thread fall along the path. If someone tripped, she would apologize to them in her head and mean it.\n\nShe reached the place where an old concrete lip makes a small amphitheater for the river to gossip to itself. That\u2019s where she sat and waited for the hour when things that shouldn\u2019t happen generally decide to happen anyway, because other things are tired and the day is too long and everyone wants a short cut.\n\nIt came like rain that misses you and then gets you back. The river sighed as if it remembered it had something to do. A few bags spun out of a hidden current and made their private ballet. Then more. Then enough that a man walking his dog picked up the dog reflexively because he had heard a story from a cousin about a cousin\u2019s cousin, and stories scare more than facts ever do. Mar tasted sugar. Poly had come without announcing herself this time. Which meant she was learning.\n\n\u201cDid you put out a line,\u201d Polycarpella said, and there was affection in it as if she were complimenting a child with chalk on her hands. \u201cYou\u2019ll catch nothing and everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome sit,\u201d Mar said. \u201cTalk. I don\u2019t get paid overtime.\u201d\n\nPoly laughed and came down like a queen and a cigarette, both, and sat on the rail so her bags could slide and shimmy. \u201cYou got your little tools,\u201d she observed. \u201cSo do I. You showed me a trick this morning. I like tricks. We should trade. That\u2019s a city thing, isn\u2019t it? I give you an easier life. You give me the air.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that all? The air?\u201d Mar\u2019s ring warmed. The thread around the railing hummed like a June bug.\n\n\u201cThe ability to stop fussing,\u201d Poly corrected. \u201cGive me that. Tell your friends they can stop counting their recycled cans. Let the world be heavy and rich in plastic. Let me wrap it. Let me keep it safe. You can go and sew dresses and I will sew the rest. They love me,\u201d she added with a small almost-win. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the love I get. Little old ladies who have saved every single bag from every single grocery trip. They feel good when they give them to me. Boys who lick sauce off the corner of a carry-out bag and bite it a little because it tastes like pepper. They\u2019ll give me theirs too. I am put to use. I am wanted. You understand that one, I bet.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want me to bless it,\u201d Mar said. \u201cBecause if a saint blesses it, it becomes fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said saint,\u201d Poly murmured. \u201cNot me.\u201d\n\nThe river broke and fixed itself around them. A boat went by, and a man whose whole job was to wave waved. Poly didn\u2019t exist for him. That was one of the worst parts, and one of the oldest. There are always people doomed to be looked through.\n\n\u201cLet me show you something,\u201d Poly said, and her voice made the knots in her bag-dress pop like corn. She put out her hand, and Mar put out hers, and for a second they touched\u2014not fingers, but intention. A little spark lit. Poly pulled.\n\nMar fell into a hard bright thing. You can fall into things that are not holes. You can fall into a smell or a sound. She fell into the feeling she gets when she goes home and opens the cupboard where the plastic bags live, though she had been the one to make sure there were only six in there. She fell into the sensation of a bag on her hand as she carried bottles home, the way it cuts your fingers when you refuse to take two trips. She fell into the first bag she had ever touched, when she was four and bored and made a kite out of it and watched it thrash and thought, oh.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d Poly said into her ear when ears were not ears and river was not river. \u201cWe are all together. So easy. Why not like this forever?\u201d\n\nMar wanted to nod. It was easier. She could cry later. She could be righteous later. The ring went cool on her wrist. Her aunt\u2019s needle pricked her thumb from a century away. She remembered the man who had waved because that had been his whole job. She remembered milkweed floss snagged on a fence, half soft and half with the fence still in it. She remembered Big Mike saving the boy. She remembered the broom.\n\n\u201cBecause my hands still work,\u201d she said.\n\nShe pushed, not to shove Poly away but to make space again. Poly squeaked\u2014just a small sound, but a real one. Mar slid out of that airless hung thing. She put her feet on concrete and it felt like the best bed in the universe. She grabbed the thread that lay along the path and wrapped it around her palm and threw the free end toward Poly\u2019s dress.\n\nThe thread snicked into the bags. The color spread. Navy like a baseball night. Poly snatched at it. It tied itself in three loops around three different handles. It didn\u2019t want to be a ribbon. It wanted to be a line. It wanted to be a road laid down between two places.\n\nMar yanked. Hard. Not angry, not yet. Hard the way you pull weeds, the way you pull a friend out of a fight. The bags snapped. Three blows the river took like kisses. The bits darted and skittered, but they were bits now, not whole. Behind Poly, the air wobbled. She looked back like someone just said her name in her mother\u2019s voice the day she was supposed to start school. Her face, for a breath, was young. It wasn\u2019t kind. Young is never kind when you catch it.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be mean,\u201d Poly said softly. \u201cI wanted it soft. You don\u2019t want soft. So it\u2019ll be mean. Your choice, baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want,\u201d Mar said, and didn\u2019t finish yet, because the river decided the rest. A gust came off it like someone early to work flipping all the chairs off all the tables. The bags lifted. The thread hummed out of her hand in a long line that tied itself to the key in her pocket, which, how, but it did. The ring warmed so quickly it startled her into a laugh that sounded like a choke. Poly\u2019s hands blurred. The air between water and street made little gasps. People moved away without knowing why.\n\nMar held on. She held the line because it was in her hand. She held the key because it had decided to be the weight she needed. She held the memory of milkweed floss and the way last fall it had flown like a promise and like an apology out over the lots where buildings used to be and the lots where people would make gardens when the ground gave them back all the little things the last people had asked of it.\n\nPoly\u2019s face changed again. It stopped being TV. It stopped being bought. It became a face that was only a face. Then she was gone again, this time fast, like she\u2019d been yanked in a direction she didn\u2019t like to go.\n\nMar didn\u2019t stand like a victor. She didn\u2019t whoop. She let herself sit as soon as she could and breathe that heavy river air until it felt like she could remember how to tell her lungs and the city\u2019s lungs apart. The thread lay around her like a cat. The ring cooled slowly, the pleasant way a burned pan cools, all sizzle and suddenly sensible. The key hummed in her pocket. Beyond her, the river kept doing the only thing it knew: be too much and be exactly enough.\n\nSomebody clapped. She almost yelled at them. It was Big Mike, who had somehow walked across half a city a man his size had no business conquering in an hour. He held a pancake to-go box in one hand and his hat in the other. He had two more kids with him now, because kids attach themselves to the adults they suspect will not lie to them today.\n\n\u201cBrought you some sweetness I promised the boy,\u201d he said, as if all this had been on pause while he picked up syrup. \u201cYou look like you just ran a marathon sitting down. That\u2019s my favorite cardio.\u201d\n\n\u201cI held a thing I didn\u2019t know I could,\u201d Mar said faintly.\n\nMike got serious like a curtain when it\u2019s time. \u201cYou keep that thing near. Because she ain\u2019t a one-time. You know that now. She wants to be every breath. And you, looks like, a breath she didn\u2019t plan for. You don\u2019t fight that by being mad alone. Even Jesus had twelve.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got the Council,\u201d Mar said, making a face.\n\n\u201cYou got me,\u201d Mike said. \u201cYou got your aunt. You got that boy, who gonna draw you on his notebook a thousand times and make you look worse each time. You got those kids. You got the lady behind you pretending to tie her shoe who just took film of more than we thought a phone can see. Oh, you got plenty. And you got yourself, Mar. That\u2019s the loudest one of all.\u201d\n\nShe opened the pancake box and laughed, for real this time, at the two fat round cakes smiling up with bubbling syrup and a pat of butter like the moon. She ate one careful bite before the breeze jerked and threw a curl of hair into her mouth. She picked it out, annoyed and alive, and said to the river because it was the only thing that could hold it, \u201cI want this city not to drown.\u201d\n\nThe river shrugged. It had work to do. But it heard her. And far down under the steps, under the tiles with irises painted on, a bell restlessly thought about ringing again soon.",

                              "content": "The storm that had been thinking about itself all afternoon finally took the job. It came across the city with its cuffs rolled, the way a good barber approaches a head that has not had a cut in awhile. Clouds buttoned as if someone practiced with nimble fingers, and the wind tasted like someone had knocked a pipe in a basement you hadn\u2019t visited in years. Latrice stood in the shop doorway with a pin in her mouth, looking up like she didn\u2019t approve of weather that got ideas.\n\n\u201cYou going to make me hem in this?\u201d she asked, and Mar laughed because the thunder had a sense of humor you had to acknowledge or it would get petty.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll pin while you baste,\u201d Mar said. She moved behind the counter and let the thread in the spool in her pocket settle against the wood like a cat that knew exactly which lap was home. She had washed the river off her arms, but you don\u2019t wash the river out of your ears, not if it has spoken your name; every noise in the city was slotted now into before and after the bell. Across the street, a man locked down his fruit stand with a tarp that had once been a banner that said VOTE and now said OTE. A girl ran with her hair uncoiling like a ribbon thinking better of a bow. Somewhere a bus sighed at a corner and decided it could be late without anyone breaking a deal.\n\nThe bell in her chest rang not out loud and not quiet either. It stole the taste of the last sentence she had been about to say and replaced it with the exact route to take if you wanted to get to the wrong door on purpose. She saw it in the seam between two clouds like the gleam in a friend\u2019s eye when they have a good bad idea. On the counter, the piston ring warmed the skin under it as if to say, I have opinions about this sort of weather. Latrice pulled the pin from her mouth and set it down in the little turtle-shaped dish that kept them together.\n\n\u201cGo,\u201d she said without sighing. \u201cYou walking or you thinking you can bribe a bus to be on time?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe buses and I are having a separation,\u201d Mar said, and Latrice took the dress in her hands and turned it in a way that meant she was both listening and keeping it patient. \u201cI\u2019ll cut through by the stadium. If I see Mr. Solomon I\u2019ll tell him your rye bread is still making me dream about butter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see Mr. Solomon in this weather, he\u2019s under an awning protecting something,\u201d Latrice said. \u201cTake the green jacket. The one with the deep pockets. I don\u2019t want to watch you drop a tile down a storm drain and make me have to pretend not to laugh.\u201d\n\nThe jacket had been made three winters ago out of army surplus that had met a handful of glitter and decided to reconsider its life. Latrice had deepened the pockets not because she suspected a niece would need to carry charms, but because people need to carry things. The iris tile went into one pocket. The key went into the other. The ring sat on her arm like it had every right. The spool thread she looped across her shoulders beneath the jacket, and it hummed along her collarbone, pleased to have a path. She tried the broom in her hands and it didn\u2019t come. It wasn\u2019t a thing you could call when you were half-dressed. It came when the bell told it to or when your hands remembered a sweep all by themselves.\n\nShe kissed her aunt on the cheek because some days you don\u2019t let yourself be cool. On Vernor the air came thin and sharp already, the rain not yet falling, the electric in the wires practicing a murmur. Down the block boys shouted at the sky like they could make it choose the other street. A dog\u2019s nails clicked as its owner hurried the walk because the last time the thunder had thrown its weight around, the dog had tried to climb into the deli case. The wind tugged at the edges of billboards so they billowed and sucked back, trying on tomorrow\u2019s messages and then resettling into today\u2019s. She walked with her hands inside the jacket, fingers on ring and thread and tile and key, as if each finger could be a different person with something to say.\n\nAt the corner of Michigan and Rosa Parks, a red boy leaned on a mailbox and watched her approach with a slouch that every generation had invented for themselves and borrowed from the last. He was not a boy and not a man and not anything you could point to without the pointing doing the wrong thing. He wore a gray hoodie with the sleeves pushed up, though if you looked too long, you saw the sleeves were a shade too bright and too old a cut to be bought last year. His sneakers were new the way a fox is new when it\u2019s just changed coats. His hair stuck up in a whorl like a flame remembering itself. The corner looked quieter where he stood, which is how you noticed him if you didn\u2019t already know.\n\n\u201cYou going to them pipes,\u201d he said as if he had been stealing the bell\u2019s mail for centuries. He wouldn\u2019t come to you unless he had an insult under his tongue he thought you could take. He grinned. \u201cYou smell like pancakes and decisions. That\u2019s nasty. You got any sugar for me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour timing is disrespectful,\u201d she said, but she dug in her jacket anyway and found, to her own dirty delight, that Big Mike had stuffed two little sugar packets into the pancake box, because of course he had. She held one up. The red boy\u2019s eyes brightened in a way that made you forget small cruelties and remember bigger ones.\n\n\u201cYou know me,\u201d he purred, and walked two fingertips in the air as if he had feet up there. \u201cYou so clever you probably know all my names too, the ones people only use when they want to get a little clout off of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know the one my great-grandmother called you when she was drunk at Easter and the ham went the wrong way,\u201d Mar said. \u201cAnd I know you aren\u2019t here to scare me, because if you were here to scare me, you wouldn\u2019t ask for sugar. You\u2019d just take it.\u201d\n\nHe laughed like a firecracker at a low-grade parade that will surprise you anyway. \u201cYou think you got me,\u201d he said. \u201cI got me. That\u2019s my whole problem. I come in when they make the same mistake twice with the same kind of stubborn. That\u2019s today, baby. That\u2019s your plastic girl thinking she can be rain. That\u2019s you thinking you can be a wall. You ain\u2019t a wall. You\u2019re a door. Remember that. You give me the sugar and I\u2019ll tell you something not obvious.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll tell me something obvious in a way that will annoy me,\u201d she said, but she tore open the packet and tapped the crystals onto his palm, and when his hand touched hers it felt exactly like skin should, hot and small and real. He threw the sugar back like a shot and shuddered with pleasure so human it snapped, for a second, the magic clean in two. He leaned closer, breath sweet now, voice not sweet at all.\n\n\u201cYou got a friend in the drains. She don\u2019t think she\u2019s your friend because she think you kids put dirt under her skirt, which, fair, but she\u2019s tired of new dirt. Talk to the old iron. Talk to the woman with the chain of keys who unlocks more than she knows. She got a ring of power and she think it\u2019s for doors only. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s a song. Also,\u201d he finished, smacking his lips with a vulgarity that made a toddler across the street grin, \u201cif it smells like cucumber melon, that\u2019s where your girl Poly thickest. She likes comfort.\u201d\n\n\u201cCucumber melon is a sin and a half,\u201d Mar said, and the red boy howled with appreciation, clapped his hands once, and was the air again next to the mailbox with a sticker on it that said WE MISS YOU and didn\u2019t specify who.\n\nShe skirted the stadium because you don\u2019t ask a place to bless you if you didn\u2019t buy a ticket. The rain began in a run of coins, big drops scattered far, making the dust jump. She cut between garages and let the chain link fence tell her gossip with its little rattling teeth. On the river side of Jefferson the city bent itself down into its working face. Pipes swallowed bad news fast. Gulls jerked like paper caught in a breath. The sign at the fence that said NO TRESPASS in two languages had been Sharpied over to say PLEASE TAKE ONLY WHAT YOU CAN CARRY, which is not any better and somehow felt kinder.\n\nShe had been to the Detroit Wastewater Treatment Plant once as a seventh grader, because some teacher had thought that showing children what happens after a flush would make them love civic systems. She had half-listened then and she had listened to the pipes. She had remembered the smell as a sentence that had every clause you could imagine and then a few more. Today it was worse and not. The rain hit warmed concrete and called up last summer\u2019s afternoons when the city had been very tired and wanted to sit down in the middle of the street, but it also began to collect, and when the city collects water it finds its old paths again, which is a relief, if you are built of old paths.\n\nAt the service gate a woman stood with a ring of keys so heavy it made her lean a little, the way love does if you don\u2019t distribute it properly across your day. She had on a poncho that had seen better uncles. Her hair, braided, was pinned up under a cap with a logo that had been washed so often it looked like a family story. She watched the rain like it was a supervisor she didn\u2019t like and had to make nice with. When she saw Mar, she lifted her chin, a greeting that nobody would notice if they weren\u2019t meant to.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d she said, and there was a smile under the words but only if you worked for it. \u201cWe got a model say we about to overflow like preachers\u2019 plates. You one of the ones who makes the pumps listen?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m one of the ones who makes the pumps tell me why they\u2019re sulking,\u201d Mar said. She wanted to be small; she wanted to be joke; she wanted to be useful without anyone putting a name on it and making her shake. \u201cCouncil sent me. Maybe I sent myself. The bell isn\u2019t clear on paperwork.\u201d\n\n\u201cBell\u2019s never clear,\u201d the woman agreed. She shifted her keys like she was letting them settle into their favorite place on the ring. \u201cName\u2019s Ernestine. Do not call me Ernie unless you bring me empanadas. You got something heavy on you? You look like a coat hook.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a ring,\u201d Mar said, and showed her. Ernestine\u2019s eyes sharpened in the way people\u2019s eyes do when they see something specific in a sea of mess.\n\n\u201cThat little cousin\u2019s been missing from the plant\u2019s museum since my second divorce,\u201d she observed, and then laughed at Mar\u2019s face. \u201cRelax. We ain\u2019t the kind to push paper at you. We\u2019re the kind to push buttons when the paper says do not push. Come on. We got secondary clarifiers looking like cappuccino and it ain\u2019t time of day for that. If your bag-girl going to turn the rain into a carrying system, she\u2019s going to hit us where the pipes and the rivers have to shake hands. That means outfalls. That means every mouth in this city we pretend to have under control.\u201d\n\nThey ducked into the facility and the smell got complicated. Rain plus iron plus a whiff of something sweet that did not belong. Cucumber melon, faint and vicious, as if a high school locker had been opened fifty miles away and blown in ahead of a squall. Ernestine\u2019s keys chattered. She took stairs fast, her boots knowing where not to slide. The plant was a maze built by men who had never gotten lost in a grocery store because they had wives with lists. Ernestine did not get lost. She didn\u2019t glance back to see if Mar was keeping up. That was trust, in a way.\n\nAt a steel door at the bottom of a flight, Ernestine slapped a card and turned a key at the same time. The door sighed open as if it had been holding its breath since noon. Inside, a low room spread itself under a forest of thicker pipe. Rainwater on concrete ran toward drains that had mouths like hungry things. The sound of the whole city\u2019s habit came through the walls, a million little secrets arguing over who would go first down the slope. In the far corner, a grate strained. Water had gathered there where water had no permission to be. It roiled like it had been stirred by a spoon. In it, white.\n\nIt was not a white you could call innocent. It was the white you get when you mix too many paints and the paper gives up; it was the center of store-bought bread; it was the smile on a bag printed with a green leaf that had never met a tree. The bags came out of the swollen grate like eels learning to be daylight. They were narrow and long where they had been stretched by current. They slipped around each other and made a braid. Ernestine said a swear word that had been used by her mother and then apologized to the wall, because the wall had a saint taped to it from someone else\u2019s superstition.\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t ours,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s nobody\u2019s. That\u2019s your girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all of ours,\u201d Mar said, not to be contrary, but because if she started pretending otherwise she would never be able to look at a kitchen sink again. \u201cCan you hold her here?\u201d\n\nErnestine gave the grate a hard look. \u201cDepends what you mean by hold. If I close the gate upstream, it\u2019ll blow a lid somewhere else. If I open, we flush the river with filth and your bag-baby gets a ride. We designed this for storms, we just didn\u2019t design it for malice.\u201d\n\n\u201cCall the pumps,\u201d Mar said, and Ernestine laughed like a mechanic.\n\n\u201cThe pumps stay kissing my feet. They\u2019re already screaming for me.\u201d\n\nThe ring on Mar\u2019s wrist warmed. The thread around her throat hummed like a crowd waiting to catch a chorus. She put her palm on the pipe nearest her that had beads of condensation fat as pearls and listened as if it were the only voice and knew better. The pumps said: tired. The pumps said: we will do it anyway. The pipes said: keep them out of our teeth. The grate said: I am a mouth and I am not designed for this food.\n\nThat smell came again, cucumber melon, the bath gel of someone who didn\u2019t trust water to be itself and had to dress it up. Polycarpella\u2019s voice brushed the low ceiling like a shawl shaking itself out. Heard you brought a key, it said. That\u2019s precious. I brought me.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be in here,\u201d Ernestine told the air, which is how you address anything you plan to fight without hurting feelings you will need to live in later. \u201cWe got rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, rules,\u201d Poly cooed, and in the grate the braid of bags went slicker, slicker, until it became a hand. Not a hand. A suggestion of a hand, a mitt shape, the idea of grip. It slid under the surface and pushed. The water bulged as if someone standing under it were about to cough.\n\nMar put her fingers in the heavy ring and pulled a little on the memory of up-down. The piston ring remembered its job and sent its rhythm into her bones. The pumps heard it and said Oh. They found an old timing, the way a choir finds a key after the tenors go adventuring. Ernestine\u2019s keys hummed against her hip, sympathetic. Above them the thunder put its shoulders against the sky and pushed again. The grate jumped.\n\n\u201cYou got that key?\u201d Ernestine said, not because she wanted to watch a magic trick, but because a person wearing a key should be allowed to use it before you ask them to use their blood. Mar dug into the pocket and pulled it out. It was heavier than it looked and didn\u2019t look light to begin with. It had teeth worn smooth by a door that liked being opened. She put it in her hand and it sat there and waited to be told a story.\n\n\u201cOpen what,\u201d she asked Ernestine, because sometimes the best thing magic can do is respect human habit.\n\nErnestine pointed to a box the size of a good suitcase that had been bolted shut since sneaky became a word. \u201cThat\u2019s where the backwash gate lives. You can crack it and make a joke out of my job or you can crack it and give us twenty seconds of mercy. Only you\u2019ll know which the second it starts to move. You ready to be responsible for the difference?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mar said, and set the key in the lock. The teeth caught like an echo finding its source. She turned because her hand wanted to, not because she had been told. The box lid creaked open less than an inch and the ring on her wrist went hot enough to make her hiss, which made Ernestine reach for her instinctively and then pull her hand back because she had been taught not to get between a person and their work.\n\nThe water in the corner changed its face. It released a breath it had been pretending not to hold, a sigh that rolled like a baby back onto a bed. The bags in the braid fluttered as if the idea of a hand had been corrected by a teacher with an eraser. The pumps hit their rhythm with a little hop, and Ernestine grinned, which made her look like her sister\u2019s prom picture and not a woman who had been keeping the city from drowning since the Clinton administration.\n\n\u201cYou a door,\u201d said a voice next to Mar\u2019s ear, and she swung her head and saw nobody because the red boy doesn\u2019t show up where men have wrenches in their hands. \u201cRemember when you pretend to be a wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop helping if you\u2019re not going to help,\u201d she told him under her breath, and from the far corner Ernestine said, \u201cWe good?\u201d and the grate said, \u201cNot yet,\u201d and the bags said, in Poly\u2019s many mouths, \u201cCutie, you think your sound matters more than mine?\u201d\n\nPoly came in through a hairline crack between the idea of rain and the idea of a pipe. She did not need a door because she could be the idea of a door. She unfolded herself the way a well-folded t-shirt disappoints you and then becomes your favorite again by accident. In the low light her dress of bags looked like satin if satin had been invented by a factory that loved turtles. Her hair was wet and perfect. The smell in the room turned sugared, then snapped bitter as if someone had poured a cologne and a cleanser into the same sink and told them to make peace.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t invite me,\u201d she said, and put her bare foot down on the concrete where the water ran in a thin sheet. The water tried to get out from under her and could not, which offended it. \u201cIt\u2019s sweet to be somewhere people think they can count. It makes me feel like a teenager in a shoplifting way.\u201d\n\nErnestine reached for a lever with the calm of someone who has extinguished three different small fires this week without getting to tell anyone. \u201cWe got rules,\u201d she repeated, and Poly smiled at her as if she kept a gratitude journal.\n\n\u201cYou have habits,\u201d she said. \u201cRules are temporary, habits are religion. I am a habit.\u201d\n\n\u201cHabits can be broken,\u201d Ernestine said, and her hand tightened. \u201cAsk my second ex.\u201d\n\nMar stepped forward because if she didn\u2019t, the room would get shoved into the place where she didn\u2019t get to participate in her own morning. She lifted the spool thread from under her collar and let it run into her palm. It shone navy even in the bad light, a quiet blue that belonged to men in caps late after a game. She flicked the end of it at the water where Poly had made her hand-shape. The thread skipped across the surface the way tiny stones do when a child who has not yet learned to respect lakes throws what they have. The thread touched a bag. The bag winced.\n\n\u201cHow many you got,\u201d Poly asked her pleasantly. \u201cYou think you can pick them off one at a time? You think you can snip every hair on my head without me noticing and slapping your fingers?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I can teach your hair not to like its split ends,\u201d Mar said, and Ernestine made a noise that was either a laugh or a small cry, hard to tell which from this angle. \u201cI think the pumps are going to sing over you. I think the grate is tired of being kinked. I think the city loves you only because you make their hands feel busy and the difference between that and worship is going to ruin you.\u201d\n\nPoly\u2019s smile flattened. The bags at her shoulders tightened and chattered against each other like teeth. \u201cYou think you\u2019re the only girl with an aunt,\u201d she said softly. \u201cYou think someone didn\u2019t teach me a sewing trick? Come on then. Let\u2019s stitch.\u201d\n\nShe flicked her fingers and the bags braided faster. They made cords. The cords made ropes. The ropes made a weave. It was not a net that you would fish with. It was a net you would throw over a mouth. It lifted and came down, and the grate squealed in the voice of a metal animal that hates what it has been asked to do and must do it anyway. Ernestine swore the swear again and then another one that was older and was nobody\u2019s business but her grandmother\u2019s. She threw her weight on the lever. Water, disrespected, slapped up and hit Mar in the face. It tasted old and new and made a little sadness bloom at the back of her tongue that she did not have time to attend to.\n\nThis was where the broom should be, her hand told her, and her hand was right. She breathed not in through her nose and not through her mouth but through the space where her face had been when she was five and clean. The broom came. It came as a weight in her grip that made her shoulders remember echoing church basements with folding chairs and sweeping after a wake. She pushed it forward, not down, and the water went where she asked, not like it was obedient, but like it was curious whether she might be right. The weave hit the broom and snarled. That pleased the weave as weaves love to tangle. The thread in her other hand looped around the mess without being asked because thread can be that way when it sees a chance to be glory.\n\nPoly dropped her voice to a whisper that almost had admiration in it and then didn\u2019t. \u201cOh, you do chores,\u201d she said, and the weave tried to ride up the broom handle and eat Mar\u2019s arms. The ring flared heat that stopped at the edge of pain and lived there on purpose. It strobed. The pumps found the strobe and matched it, and for a second the room felt like a club for the blessed and exhausted. Ernestine pressed two buttons at once and then a third she had promised herself she would never press unless water touched her ribs.\n\nThe key in Mar\u2019s pocket started to hum in a way you could feel in your teeth. She grabbed it with three fingers and held it against the broom\u2019s handle. The broom, which had been nothing-to-see, became something. It became a good five inches of a real broom at its end, straw and wire and the ghost of your aunt\u2019s broom from her kitchen. Poly noticed. Her smile turned up in one corner like an anger that had decided it would wear lipstick.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to ruin your hair,\u201d she said sweetly, and the cucumber melon smell thickened to the point where Ernestine gagged and snapped a little piece of peppermint out of her pocket and put it under her tongue like a spell. \u201cYou wear that ring like it\u2019s a lapel pin. Do you even know what it can pull? Do you know how many cars forgot and still started because somebody begged them? I am the forgetting and you are the begging. Don\u2019t embarrass yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou talk like a commercial,\u201d Mar said. She pushed the broom again and the weave caught and sagged and had to make a decision about whether it wanted to be a rope or a net. The pumps stuttered once, twice, and then came in heavier, not because the electricity loved them, but because somebody out there in the plant had kicked something that needed kicking. Ernestine sucked in a breath that made the hairs on Mar\u2019s arm stand up and yelled without looking toward the ceiling, \u201cWhoever did that, I will bring you empanadas!\u201d and it was the right thing to say.\n\nThe iris tile was heavy in her pocket in a way that had nothing to do with clay. She pulled it out and for a second she thought she might actually put it in her mouth, which was absurd and perfectly fine. She pressed it to her lower lip. The paint tasted old blue. It tasted like the station did on a good day when somebody had dragged a broom up the marble just because attention is a kind of soap. She let that taste into her chest and then into the room.\n\nIt changed the water\u2019s posture. It made a memory in it. It made it recall how it looks when it carries lanterns down river instead of names on plastic. Poly frowned\u2014not a great big victory, but a chip. The weave lost heart for a flicker. Mar\u2019s thread made a loop. The loop caught. It tied itself into a knot that was not structurally sound but was spiritually influential. She yanked with all the small strength in her back and the ring said up-down again like a song you could take to the church of your choice.\n\n\u201cA door,\u201d the red boy whispered, almost pleased. \u201cYou opening and closing in the same breath. Can\u2019t decide what you are. That\u2019s how you survive.\u201d\n\nThe weave broke. It tore in three long boohoo strips that went sulking toward a drain they should never have met. The grate shivered itself back into reasonable, which is a thing grates can do when they feel respected. Ernestine whooped in a language the pumps understood and did not like but forgave her for. The cucumber melon smell cut out so abruptly it was like someone had taken a mother\u2019s voice out of a room. Poly stood in the middle of the tired light and looked not cheap and not holy. She just looked like a girl in a dress that had been made out of apologies.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re inconvenient,\u201d she said to Mar as if she were discussing a calendar. \u201cDo you always disappoint people who want to feel good? Is that your kink?\u201d\n\n\u201cI like to make quilts out of people\u2019s plans,\u201d Mar said. She was shaking a little now because the broom wanted to be gone and her hands wanted to keep it. \u201cGo home.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I told you before,\u201d Poly said, and for the first time her voice went true under the sugar. \u201cEverywhere\u2019s home.\u201d She looked at Ernestine, who stared back with the raw amused contempt of women who get three hours of sleep and make coffee taste like an apology men should be ashamed to accept. \u201cThey will love me tomorrow. They will forget this. They will throw away the things they need and then call themselves the victims. You\u2014\u201d she pointed at Mar, delicate, because you do not use the full hand when you threaten someone you respect\u2014\u201cyou will keep doing chores. I will keep being a habit. See you at the lake.\u201d\n\nShe broke along a seam no one else could see and went out through the pipe, not up not down, but sideways in the way the city sometimes takes if you make one wrong turn and end up at a view of downtown that makes you forget what you were late for. The room loosened itself around Mar and Ernestine like a fist that had decided it did not want to hit anybody, not today. Rain came harder. Somewhere a man yelled wait up! to rain like it owed him money.\n\nErnestine leaned back against the wall and slid down until she was sitting on the wet floor with her legs straight out and her keys spilling over her knee. \u201cWe going to the lake,\u201d she said, and there was a small frightened boy in that sentence and also a woman with a clipboard who was ready to write down when and who and what boat. \u201cGood. I don\u2019t sleep on lake days anyway. Here.\u201d She pulled a little brown bottle from her pocket, the kind a person keeps because they believe in minor miracles. She offered it. \u201cPeppermint. Or moonshine. Hard to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeppermint,\u201d Mar said, and let the sharpness clear the last of the cucumber out. \u201cThank you. For not asking me if I could do that meaner. For not asking me why I\u2019m not more magical.\u201d\n\n\u201cI seen magical,\u201d Ernestine said. \u201cIt always shows up looking like work. You any good outside in a blow, or you going to get peeled off the rail like a sticker?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tie myself down,\u201d Mar said. She meant it and wasn\u2019t sure how. The thread on her shoulder purred like it had an idea.\n\n\u201cWe got a line boat,\u201d Ernestine said, getting up in the way she had trained her knees to do it without complaining in public. \u201cNot going to be fancy. Going to be ours. You want help, ask for it. Don\u2019t ask the red one. He loves watch disasters like a World Cup and he bet the wrong side on purpose. Ask the bridges. They always know who is lying. And take a slicker. You\u2019re about to be wetter than your aunt trying not to say what she is thinking at a wedding.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know my aunt,\u201d Mar asked, because sometimes you ask a ridiculous thing to see what the city will admit.\n\n\u201cI know the way certain women hold their mouths when they have to pin two edges that don\u2019t belong,\u201d Ernestine said. \u201cYou all got the same grandmother. Now move, or my pumps will decide they live for you and I can\u2019t have that. I have a relationship with them that does not need a third party.\u201d\n\nThey made decisions quickly then because the storm had decided to commit. Ernestine slapped a list into a hand, and the hand belonged to a man who had fixed a laugh wrong once and had not had time to fix it again. He ran. She picked up a radio and squeezed it until it squealed and told whoever was on the other end to call the line boat and tell them to wear the good life vests, not the ones with foam trying its best. She told Mar where to go that would get her to a dock that sailors used when the city wasn\u2019t looking.\n\nOn her way up, the red boy leaned out of a shadow at the stair\u2019s bend and held out something tiny and bright in his palm. It was a penny from a year they had said meant something and forgotten why. It had been rubbed so smooth no face was left on it, just a round assertion that copper loves fingers.\n\n\u201cSteal me a habit,\u201d he murmured, feral and almost kind. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you back with gossip.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need news from upriver,\u201d she said, and took the penny because pennies ask not to be turned away. \u201cI need where she likes to sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe likes to sleep under signs that say NO FISHING,\u201d he said, delighted by his own meanness, and he blew her a kiss he intended to annoy her and succeeded and was gone with a smell like Friday night.\n\nThe rain came proper when she hit the levee. It flattened hair and expectation without asking permission. The river fluffed itself despite the weight. The skyline went bruise-purple in a way that made the glass hotels apologize for themselves. A line boat waited with two men in orange vests and a woman who had a cigarette in the corner of her mouth that the rain could not budge. The woman flicked a look at Mar and at her jacket and at the ring and didn\u2019t say anything sentimental like You ready. She jerked her head toward the bow.\n\n\u201cYou stand there,\u201d she said. \u201cYou say something when the wind goes dumb. If you got friends, you say their names out loud. Boat likes that.\u201d\n\nThe ring pulsed. The thread hummed itself quiet and then louder. The broom was not visible which was comfort because this was not a room, and brooms like rooms. The key knocked against her thigh like a nervous kid. The tile warmed as if it thought it had become a hand warmer by mistake. What she loved most about her city in that moment was that nothing told her she couldn\u2019t. What she loved least was that everyone was going to watch.\n\nThey pushed off. The boat was small. The river was not. Her wings wanted to come and she told them no. The wind liked commands. It should not be cajoled. She planted her boots and thought about sewing, not because it was cute, but because when you keep two pieces of different behavior together and make them act like one, you need the right thread and the correct amount of patience and a willingness to pull something apart when it lies. The boat cut a wake that felt like a zipper being asked questions. The rain softened at the edges, then bit down again. Lights along the Canadian side blinked a language that was suspicious and neighborly. In the distance, the lift of a freighter\u2019s bulk moved like a thought that had been having itself for days before anyone heard it.\n\nThey passed under a bridge. It breathed above them, the old iron content and sad. You would never know there were people sleeping up in its bones unless you were the kind of person who knew that sort of thing. A gull sat out the storm on a bollard and narrowed its eyes at her with an expression exactly like a city aunt who had decided she liked you but was not to be handled lightly. She said the names she had been told to say: Latrice. Solomon. Delphine. Calendar. Sifa. Micah. Ernestine. Mike. The river shrugged but did not object. Sometimes it is enough.\n\nThe boat nose dipped and rose, dipped and rose, the piston ring singing in her wrist with each up-down, making the water\u2019s movement into a thing her body could claim, not agree to, but incorporate. Ahead, where the river yawns at the lake and has to argue about who it is going to be, Poly had left presents. White snagged where white should not. Foam that did not break. Slicks that smelled like cucumber melon and lies. The line boat\u2019s pilot swore through their cigarette and the men at the lines went quiet in the way men go quiet when they are about to decide to do something stupid and hope it works.\n\n\u201cYou talk to the lake,\u201d the pilot murmured to Mar, not because she believed in fairy girls, but because in the absence of believing, you delegate. \u201cShe\u2019s crankier than the river. She\u2019s old. She\u2019s had husbands. Don\u2019t tell her what to do. Ask her if she remembers being blue.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not flatter her,\u201d Mar said, but she almost smiled because petty keeps you warm. She leaned into the wind and put her palm out toward the darking mouth where the lake breathed, work to do and no patience with anyone who didn\u2019t have hands. The tile warmed to heat like a stove edge not yet safe. She lifted it to her lips again. She let the ring tell her wrist where to hold steady. She took the thread in her other hand and let the end trail into the lake-wet air.\n\n\u201cLake,\u201d she said, once, which is likely a sin. The pilot turned their head slightly and pressed the cigarette to the corner of their lips with a surprising delicacy. \u201cMa\u2019am. Auntie. You who always think you were the one who came up with the sky. I am not asking pretty. I am asking like a person holds a door when her arms are full. My city is learning a bad habit and the bad habit is asking to be a god. Push back. Not on us. On her. On the little rips she makes. Pull her seams. She likes taking. Take her back from us. We ain\u2019t so innocent. We are not. But we put you on t-shirts because we love you, not because we own you. That love is stupid like love should be. Don\u2019t let her make it into anything less than dumb and devout.\u201d\n\nIf the lake laughed, it wasn\u2019t cruel, but it definitely had teeth. The wind turned itself to face her instead of slapping at her side. The freighter\u2019s horn bellowed, and in the horn was the answer you get when a giant says, Fine. The slicks shivered. The white ropes loosened. The water took a breath in which it looked like itself. The rain changed the size of its drops the way a drummer changes sticks.\n\nFrom the slick came Poly\u2019s voice, not in the room this time and not in an ad, but in the place you put the thing you don\u2019t want to admit you like. \u201cYou\u2019re so boring,\u201d she said, and it was affected and it was furious. \u201cYou are going to be late everywhere for the rest of your life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI already am,\u201d Mar yelled into the wind. \u201cI got a city. We don\u2019t do on time.\u201d\n\nThe slick tore into strips, and the strips tore into confetti, and confetti is more annoying than evil if you don\u2019t let it call itself snow. The line boat slid along the outfall and the pilot did something elegant with their hand that made it look like they had never learned to be clumsy. One of the men made a throw with a hook that would have humiliated his high school self if his high school self had seen it. The rope went around a bollard. The boat held. Mar held. The ring cooled such a fraction she might have imagined it. She didn\u2019t care. Poly was in the lake now. Poly was in a place where old things could be asked to remember their old names. The work was still impossible. The work was always still impossible.\n\nShe didn\u2019t see the shape at the far bend, a black block that had made a promise to Detroit that it thought it intended to keep and then forgot. She didn\u2019t notice the small red figure perched up under the bridge stanchion kicking its heels with glee and dread. She didn\u2019t hear the bell start again below, not the one in her, but the one that told the city you have about a minute to decide if you\u2019re lucky. She held the broom you cannot see. She held the thread that wishes to be a road. She said the names she had for water and believed that maybe if she said them enough, they would leave her mouth and go to work when she was sleeping.",

                              "content": "The bell shivered through the hull in a way that made screws remember the hands that turned them. It wasn\u2019t the polite undercity bell that knocked your ribs and then held its hat. This one was a work bell, a barback\u2019s last call, a bellow from under the sills of the places Detroit had asked to be invisible when she put on her Sunday dress. The pilot cut the motor just enough to make the bow listen. Rain walked sideways for a spell and then fixed its attitude and came down like it had agreed with the river to stop fooling around. The freighter\u2019s horn rolled its vast vowel across the water a second time, and up ahead the black block that had been a shape decided to be a barge shouldered with containers the color of late bills. It hulked in the turn beyond the bridge pilings like a man at the end of a hallway deciding whether to fit.\n\n\u201cLot of iron to have opinions today,\u201d the pilot said, and she spat neatly into the river\u2019s mouth because some conversations you begin with a small honesty. \u201cIf that barge spins, we\u2019re soup. Hold on to your thread and your good names.\u201d\n\nMar kept her boots where they were and pressed her palm against air until the air pressed back. She felt the line of the thread slide along her collarbone and hum when the barge\u2019s bulk bullied the wind into finding new routes. The ring on her wrist settled into a tick that was not the boat\u2019s notch, not the lake\u2019s chop, but the barge\u2019s slow heart. She could hear, in the low drum of it, a tired story of schedules, of a captain who had started this job because his cousin had a line and stayed because the river kept making the same promises in different weather. He didn\u2019t want to be here in the storm. He was here because money has ears. Poly would like that about him, the honest compulsion of it.\n\nThey slid under the bridge again, and this time Mar spoke to it the way you speak to a relative you never call and suddenly need. She told it the names she had in her mouth and asked for the ones it kept in its bolts. The bridge breathed its big breath and told her about women who had come up into its bones with sleeping bags and bad boyfriends and had made a small heaven anyway out of coffee cans and fleece. It told her about a copper thief too clumsy to be good and too stubborn to stop before his third jolt. It told her about a man who had brought his daughter to the top at night to see whether the city still glowed when you weren\u2019t looking. It told her, in the way all such giants do, that it didn\u2019t like liars because lies put cracks in places no mortar can reach. Poly was lying whenever she called herself a home, and the bridge had the right to be offended. When it flexed its shoulders against the wind, she felt the flex in her teeth.\n\nThe first big rope of plastic\u2014Poly\u2019s weave let loose and muscled tall by rain\u2014came sliding out from under the lip of the breakwater like a seal that had learned to grin wolfish. It took a wave in its notch and set itself for the boat, not clever like a predator, just malevolent like a habit with a plan. The two line men swore the way you swear when your hands already know what to do and your mouth is just venting. The pilot feathered the throttle and spun the wheel, and the little boat pulled a trick they don\u2019t put in manuals, not because it cannot be done, but because if you write it down, some idiot will try it on a sunny day. They skipped sideways and the rope hissed past, de-boned by chop and fast contempt into a slick. The smell of cucumber melon puffed up like the worst aunt\u2019s taste in lotion and then got its feelings hurt by lake air.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s using the drains,\u201d one of the men said, not because he could see the city\u2019s gullet from here, but because he was listening as hard as Mar was and he had been taught to say true things out loud. \u201cShe\u2019s up in every gutter with a wrist and she\u2019s making them point. We\u2019ll keep getting these ropes until that bell stops.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t,\u201d Mar said. \u201cNot yet. The bell\u2019s honest. The bell says, decide.\u201d She lifted the thread hand and let the end flag and smack in the wind until it picked up a current you only notice if you are a tailor or in love. The navy line found a direction and she followed it with her palm as if it had a mind older than the spool. It pulled toward the corner where the river\u2019s last breath under the bridge turned into the lake\u2019s first. That corner was where kids shivered their bikes because the wind there always wanted to show off. It was where gulls got cocky. It was where the habit of flow changed just enough for tricksters to practice. Poly liked it because it was the seam. Mar liked it because seams hold.\n\nShe threw her attention the way you throw a lasso if you have never seen a horse. It caught anyway. It caught on a knot in the wind and made a notch in the rain big enough to take a breath. The barge felt the change as a thumb under its chin and straightened its mouth, its captain suddenly deciding to do the thing good pilots do, which is bore, not impress. The pilot on Mar\u2019s boat grunted like an overdue girl and shouted to no one in particular, \u201cThank you! Whoever did that gets my favorite cigarettes,\u201d then looked left and scowled at the slick like she could shame it back into petroleum.\n\nThreads are not made to pull whole rivers, but they are made to guide dress pieces against temper. She let the line slither into the slick, and it colored, not in a banner way, but in a quiet confession. It marked where the plastic thought it could hide. It striped a path where Poly had tightened her grip and the lake had loosened hers. The ring heat came again, that working warmth that wasn\u2019t pain because the body decided not to take offense. The broom wanted a floor, and the lake wanted a story, and Mar wanted a day she could file under Getting Away With It and forget later the way you forget a bruise, interpreting its yellowing as proof of virtue.\n\nThe pilot skimmed the boat alongside the marked slick and the men used the hooks the way you use a safety pin when the zipper betrays you in a church. They snagged, not to own, but to divert. They dragged the slick against its will toward a channel where the current had a clear destination and could be asked, politely and with the correct amount of family pressure, to take the mess toward the booms and the waiting suck of machines that were not perfect and were not useless either. You can love an imperfect machine if it works when you need mercy more than you need ideology.\n\nWater thumped the hull like a drummer who has been told there is no money in it and keeps on anyway. Rain hammered the crown of Mar\u2019s head until her hair gave up and lay down flat like a cat that has decided winter will happen no matter how it feels. She let the tile rest against her lower lip again and the taste of the painted iris steadied the little panicked part of her that kept asking for somebody else to come do it. The lake did not speak as the river does because the lake has the luxury of not needing to convince anyone. It turned its face toward her and held it there until she remembered who she was borrowing the broom from. It was her grandmother\u2019s broom and her city\u2019s broom and the broom of every woman who has ever told a room full of chaos to try again using their inside voices. She pushed without pushing. The slick folded where the thread had colored it and slipped like a tongue back into the mouth it came from, and the mouth was a pump intake that had been fitted with a net by a man who kept to himself and made things right when nobody asked him to.\n\nThey worked as a small weather in a bigger one until working became the only possible proof that they should keep trying. The barge stopped threatening to be a character and obediently chose to be a prop. The bridge sighed in gratitude, and the sigh rattled bolts in three neighborhoods where a boy turned in his sleep, a woman put her head down at her kitchen table and did not cry, and a man decided to leave a thing unsaid that would have started a fight with someone he loved. The slicks broke like promises donated to a charity that knew how to put on a gala and also how to collect trash on Monday. Cucumber melon tried to rise again and got shouted down by peppermint and diesel and the soft good musk of rain in hair.\n\nIt would be pleasing to say that Poly retreated from the lake in a dramatic tantrum, and it would be more honest to say she learned. Mar felt it when the habit changed shape, when Poly stopped insisting on being obvious. The ropes went into crumbs, the crumbs into the kind of bits that no hook can own and no line can persuade. The pumps would eat what the nets could catch, and the rest would keep the new fish learning old mistakes. The old woman of a lake shifted her knee, and the whole river moved as if to keep up its side of an old dance. That was the mercy. The insult was that the dance would always be needed.\n\n\u201cYou bought us a day,\u201d the pilot said without the piety of a thanks and therefore meaning it, and she turned the boat\u2019s nose toward a slice of dock that had never looked so hospitable in such ugly weather. \u201cIf we don\u2019t use it, I will be personally offended. You can stay out and play queen of the spoils or you can get on land and go tell someone with windows what to cover theirs with.\u201d\n\n\u201cWindows,\u201d Mar repeated, and the word did that thing where it became more than language. It became a face on Vernor with dress shadows moving behind it and a pin dish shaped like a turtle and a woman who had taught her that hems hide sins when hemmed properly. It became the glass where boys had pressed their noses the winter Latrice first set a display and made the dresses nod like women at a funeral, polite and full of secrets. It became the smashed pane at the shop two doors down where the baker had nailed up plywood and painted on it a galaxy of donuts with sugar stars. She did not want to leave the water. She was not in charge of wanting.\n\nThey made the dock with the silent diplomacy of people who accept the weather\u2019s overstaying as a fact of a city childhood. The pilot flapped a hand at her and didn\u2019t say be careful because what would be the point. The line men gave her small salutes with their hooks and then turned their attention to the work that would continue in the ordinary way like it always does after magic has lifted the day\u2019s chin and put her back on her feet. When her boots hit the planks, the bell settled itself low again and rapped on bone in that particular rhythm that only the beneath-city keeps, a call and response between pipes and promises.\n\nOn her way up the steps to street, the red boy popped his head out of a gap in the railing and grinned with wet lashes like a kid who knows where the matches are. He had one of those rain jackets that aren\u2019t rain jackets but windbreakers pretending, and water beaded on him like he wasn\u2019t convinced by the weather\u2019s argument. He walked backward up the steps in front of her, delighting in his ability to disobey gravity\u2019s tone of voice.\n\n\u201cYou did not drown,\u201d he announced, which was his way of saying you have not disappointed me yet. \u201cThe bridge didn\u2019t lie and you didn\u2019t either. That big iron had a moment where it considered whether it was tired of being decent, and you sweet-talked it without making it feel like you had.\u201d He leaned toward her without stopping his backwards climb and sniffed in a broad rude way. \u201cLake in your hair. Pumps on your shirt. Peppermint to hide the lie of fruit. Your aunt\u2019s thread under your collar and a tile like a mouth-guard. Cute. Come set a fire with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t set fires for sport,\u201d she said, and even as she said it, the air in the stairwell took on a taste of something scorched that didn\u2019t bother to hide itself. \u201cYou smell like the last day of school. What\u2019s burning and why do you want me to think I can make it better by walking into it?\u201d\n\nHe put his hand out to her with the penny on the center of his palm, the face rubbed off as if he had loved it with his thumb while telling himself he didn\u2019t care. \u201cThey lit three piles at the Packard because someone owed someone and then owed himself worse. It\u2019s not big, not yet. It\u2019s trying to be meaningful and it will end up being sad. Your little trash queen has hands there too. She loves photographers. Come take this and come faster or don\u2019t. I\u2019ll go either way. I like it all.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery time I think I\u2019ve decided to hate you, you pick a thing I already wanted to do,\u201d she said, and she took the penny because pennies liked her and because the ring on her wrist warmed in a way that made the old engine in it clear its throat and say I know that building. \u201cBut I\u2019m not leaving the west side people to choke if the drains quit again. Ernestine\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cErnestine got her hands full and a church van at her back and the long grace of cuss words on her tongue,\u201d he said, quick like gossip, annoyed that she had thought to worry in the same place he had. \u201cShe told the pumps the names of her kids and they\u2019re showing off for her. The lanes are clearing. The little floods will be photo ops. The big one will be at the lake if you stop paying attention. You ain\u2019t going to stop paying attention. We have time. Two hours. Three if the wrong person takes the wrong exit. Come on.\u201d\n\nHe tumbled up the last steps as if he had decided to imitate human exhaustion for comedy. The street above had turned the peculiar gold it turns when the light is about to fail and refuses to admit it. Headlights cut their own wet lanes and made her feel watched and safe in equal measure. She tucked her shoulders and ran, because the city had given her a day and the red boy had given her a place to spend it. The ring sang the up-down in her wrist until the rhythm became almost a tune, and she sang it under her breath to keep from begging the sky for a deal.\n\nWhen she cut past the stadium, the big letters slept under their own power. A small boy in a poncho stomped into a puddle with a zeal that made his mother laugh in a way she would deny later. A bus belched only once and then self-corrected as if embarrassed. On Vernor the baker hammered another nail into the donut galaxy with dignity. She ran by her aunt\u2019s shop and did not go in and did not look and did not think her aunt would be fooled by that for a minute. Latrice had the pin between her teeth and the dress on the form and would have turned her head slightly as if to listen to a weather report in the thread and then told the customer a true sweet lie about the way a train falls.\n\nThe Packard\u2019s bones rose up with that particular sorrowful grandeur people put in their postcards when they want their sadness to be a brand. It brooded along the blocks as if the rain were a little kid tugging on a sleeve. Smoke puffed where it ought not, soft still, worth swatting with a grown hand. The fire department had sent one truck that was already arguing with itself about which entrance to pretend was legal. A handful of people stood with their phones up, trying to translate heat into content. The red boy hopped a puddle and landed with exactly the wrong grace, a small ballerina with three felonies, and he smiled like a window thrown up in a bad room.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d he said, pleased to present her with a mess as a gift, \u201cis where your plastic saint tried to practice absolution. She told someone they were good for cleaning up their neighborhood and then told them what to do with the pile. Portable holiness is a hell of a drug. He set it alight congratulating himself. It will be sixteen cars full of poison if you let it. It will be rainbow if you let it. It will be nothing if you work fast. The cameras are hungry. You going to feed them or the fire.\u201d\n\nMar paused just long enough to meet the eyes of the woman in the turnout gear nearest her, a rectangle of a person with raindrops in her eyebrows and a mouth that had rearranged itself stubbornly to say I will not be thwarted by poor planning. The name on her coat was RUIZ and the lines around her eyes said she had been on shift long enough to owe herself a mean snack as soon as someone with rank remembered she deserved one. Mar liked her instantly and wanted to kiss her forehead and also to follow orders.\n\n\u201cYou know the inside like stairs know,\u201d Mar said to her, because it was true, and because flattery is only useful when it fits the subject like a good suit.\n\n\u201cI know when assholes light tires,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cI also know when plastic smoke gets up under a cloud lid and makes a dome the city can\u2019t breathe under. You with them?\u201d She jerked her chin at the cluster of helmeted heads that had found a hydrant that hadn\u2019t been violated by a metal thief and were now swearing at a wrench.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m with the part that stops the dome,\u201d Mar said. \u201cI can\u2019t promise you art. I can promise you a hole in a cloud big enough to make someone thank God without using his name right.\u201d\n\nRuiz gave her a long look, the kind you give a foolish niece when she says she is not a child and also asks if you have gum. She weighed her options like a chef looking at onions that had tried their best. Then she nodded, once, because you don\u2019t nod more than you need to when the day is trying to get dramatic. She pointed at the shape of a staircase that had been cleaned by ghosts and rain. \u201cUp there. Third bay. Don\u2019t die because I don\u2019t have the forms for it. Take this,\u201d and she shoved into Mar\u2019s hands a respirator with two canisters that made her feel instantly like a useful liar. \u201cIt\u2019s set for someone bigger than you. I don\u2019t mind if it looks like a necklace on you. I need you not sucking death and then preaching at me between coughs.\u201d\n\nThe red boy made a noise in his throat that meant he liked this woman and would steal her lighter if given the chance. He sprinted ahead and his feet did not squeak the way human soles do, and she envied him for exactly one second and then set her boot on the first wet step. The inside of the Packard was exactly how it always is when it is wet and people have recently played at desertion and empire: the sound of water traveling through many levels of memory, the smell of old oil and paper, the way steel sings when asked to wait. She climbed into her planet\u2019s past and felt the bell throw her a rope.\n\nPoly was present, but not in a way the eyes could rescue you from. She was in the ash gray of a plastic tub lid turned char, in the sweet nasty smoke that wants to be barbecue so bad it lies, in the generosity of neighbors who had brought their recycling to one place and felt virtuous for winning a small battle. She rode the habit of ceremony a community makes when it does the right thing on the wrong day because nobody had the nerve to tell them the schedule. She whispered over the scrap the suggestion that it wanted a flame to bless it into air. Mar wanted to slap her. Mar wanted to show everyone two pictures, one of smoke and one of turtles, and turn off all their screens until they cried.\n\nAt the third bay the pile had taken its trial run and found oxygen. The water from the first line hit it and made a hiss that was almost sultry. The heat licked at her face and tried to get behind the mask and got annoyed when it could not. The red boy was already up on a pillar like a saint in a story told naughty. He stretched his fingers toward the fire and the fire reached back, flattered, and he pulled it by its jaw subtly so it opened where he wanted it to. He did not do that for her. He did it because he likes to dance, and fire lets him lead if he feeds it compliments. He glanced down at her with that ugly-beautiful affection and then looked over her shoulder to where the night had been deciding what to call itself.\n\n\u201cLift,\u201d he said in the tone of someone who pretends to be giving advice to go with their popcorn and is actually praying.\n\nShe had the broom, strange in the open air, heavy in a way that made sense to her bones. She took a breath of damp resin and last week\u2019s banana peel and the little whisper of Latrice\u2019s mending soap that had clung to this jacket through rains and options. She lifted the broom and asked it to be a ceiling mover instead of a floor tamer. The shape of the room mattered more than the shape of the fire. The Packard\u2019s ribs still wanted to hold. The fenestrations wanted not to be blamed. She reached with the broom, up not down, and swept the smoke toward the sky with her arm telling the sky, take your unhappiness out back and finish it there. The first sweep made a mouth, a gap in the dome you could kiss with clean air. The second sweep made the mouth into a confession. The third made the smoke remember it always meant to be outside anyway.\n\nRuiz called her something that would sound like an insult in another woman\u2019s mouth and the hose crew changed angle like a couple adjusting mid-dance without losing the song. The smoke took the hint and rushed the breach she had made. The red boy\u2019s fingers twitched and the flame followed obediently to the side where a wall had already fallen once and would not be offended by a second compromise. The bell in her ribs rang again, not a panic but an instruction, and she heard in it the voice of the woman Ernestine had mentioned, the one with the chain of keys that are songs. This was not Ernestine\u2019s domain. This was a place the keys woman only visited when the city wanted to see if she remembered the steps.\n\n\u201cYou hear me,\u201d came the voice, not billowing, not echo, but the sound of someone laying keys down on a table after a night shift and telling the table it did great. \u201cYou big-talking baby, you open a window then tie it back so it don\u2019t slap. This is not your house. This is a ruin with feelings. Mind them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am minding them,\u201d Mar said, and the fireman two floors down who did not believe in fairies and did not need to heard only a girl talking to herself and was comforted by the crash of the roof letting go of a piece it had been negotiating with for two years. She tied the thread to a bent rebar up in the mouth of a window the fire had wanted, and the thread shivered and settled and held open the sky as if it had always been a curtain rope. The smoke poured itself through the circle she\u2019d made and went sulking into the rain where the day shook it cold and the smell resigned itself to being a fact. Down on the floor a bottle of something that had meant well before someone added colorant cracked with a pop and a good portion of the pile stopped pretending and flattened into saturated hush.\n\nPoly did not speak because Poly was busy with hoses down the street and with a church basement where somebody was arguing about whether metal spoons turn soup bitter and with a woman whose hands had closed around the handle of a bag too many times for her circulation to mind anymore. That was a kind of respect that made Mar want to tender her resignation from magic, and she did not have time for that tantrum, so she saved it. She saved it and worked and later her saving would look like cleverness.\n\nWhen she first came down, Ruiz squinted up and saw nothing that would hold up in a budget meeting, which is the perfect amount of miracle. What Ruiz did see was a girl doing a thing with a broom in the rain that made her want to teach her youngest how to do the thing with a broom his grandmother had done. She saw the smoke clear enough to get her crew in and out without needing to learn new names for grief. She saw the red-headed bad luck lean out like a crow and wiggle his fingers at the fire and she yelled at him purely out of principle and he laughed like fireworks that had been threatened by weather and shot off anyway.\n\n\u201cClose it,\u201d called the keys woman with no ceremony when the smoke had made its escape and the wind had found its comfort. \u201cYou don\u2019t leave a city with its shirt open. You make a crack and you stitch it when you\u2019re done, otherwise some fool will come in and make a song of it and then people will believe the song and not their own eyes.\u201d\n\nMar hauled the line and the thread obeyed, reluctant to stop being the hero. She patted the air with the broom, not to erase what she had done, but to smooth it, to thank the room with a sweep that belonged to no human and all grandmothers. She looked down and saw Ruiz\u2019s face split into a grin that made her several years younger and several paychecks richer. Ruiz put two fingers to her helmet brim and then made a circular motion with her hand that meant make a hole there and then another one there and bless you for being handy. She stayed for the other holes because if you read a place\u2019s breath once and teach it to breathe, you owe it a second. She left when the fire turned from headline to ordinary, when the cameras got bored and turned to the man who had lit the pile and wanted someone to explain him to himself.\n\nOut in the rain again, the red boy bounded beside her like the first dog after a divorce. He admired himself in every window they passed and tilted his head to compare his reflection\u2019s timing to his own. She would have smacked him if she had any hand free of thread and ring. Instead she let him talk until his voice stopped being a fire and became a boy\u2019s bragging and then became the thing behind boys\u2019 bragging, the fear he shoos with noise. He feared Poly in a way he did not fear water. He feared habit the way he did not fear wood.\n\n\u201cYou want a thing you can have without paying for it,\u201d he said after a long run of stories about women who could spit farther than he could and men who had learned to strike a match in a hurricane. \u201cYou want me to say she is weak in some place you can stab. She\u2019s not weak. She is only uninterested in things that require sitting alone with feelings. You can\u2019t stab that. You can outlast it. That\u2019s worse for you because you wanted to be clever and now you have to be patient.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could stab you,\u201d she told him in a voice that would pass as dry if the weather had been different. \u201cNot to kill. Just to train.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did that at the river. It went right in.\u201d He touched his sternum and made a face like he liked it. \u201cI am flame. Stab is a compliment. You going to go tell your aunt you are late and then laugh and then cry and then get told to hem a thing? You should. Mortals are how we don\u2019t eat each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a mortal,\u201d she said, and he snorted not because he believed otherwise but because he wished she would stop pretending belief mattered much to elements. He crouched and plucked at his shoelace and the water that had pooled there licked his fingers like an indulgent aunt, then hissed when he shook it off like an insult.\n\nThe rain began to pull away its weight in a slow sulk, leaving behind a city that looked damp and undecided. The bell under everything tapped itself careful and slow, not done, never done, but not yelling for a minute. The day had sprouted night without remembering the in between, and the streetlights flickered into their own version of alertness. between two, a busted one stuttered the rhythm that had sung Mar into the world on Ferry, and she put her fingers against the pole without thinking and felt the old heartbeat come back to meet her suspecting touch. It gave her its yes, a small one, like a nod from the back of a church, not for show, just for agreement.\n\nAt the corner before Vernor, she stopped. She stopped because a smell that was not lake and not fire and not men\u2019s work lifted out of a little storm drain and hooked her by the nostril like a fish. It was cucumber melon, but not the way Poly wore it when she wanted to be pretty. It was cucumber melon like a promise to a baby, sweetened and left too long in the car. It came up from the place where rain meets all the other waters and gets drafted into a system that gives it a job. Poly had not gone. Poly had dropped threads where only people who look wrong ever see them.\n\nErnestine\u2019s keys clinked on the level of her molars. The woman of the chain of keys did not put on a coat to meet her because she didn\u2019t need to. Her voice came up and out and into Mar\u2019s wrists where the ring waited for orders like a dog that had just learned the doorbell. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d Ernestine said. \u201cFive. Not the pretty five. The five that looks like trash trucks and black coffee. We use the day you bought or we wasted it. We\u2019ll take the line boat at dawn while the ones who think they are gods sleep off their own glory. Bring the key. Bring the thread. Bring your aunt\u2019s mean, because you will need to tell three men no and make one boy cry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate making boys cry,\u201d Mar said out loud to the street\u2019s wet glare and then corrected herself because lying to the keys woman is a sin that gets its own hymn. \u201cI don\u2019t hate it. I hate that I have to. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring someone who loves you in a way that makes you better at counting,\u201d Ernestine added, and her laugh came, short as a cough, sweet as the peppermint that cut a cheap bathroom\u2019s soap. \u201cLeave the red fool to guard a pile. He gets bored on boats and I don\u2019t want to listen to a force of nature whine. Your aunt will kill me for telling you both to be awake at that hour. I\u2019m an old woman. I can survive her glare. You, I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d\n\nMar could picture Latrice\u2019s face when she woke her, the way it would arrange itself into amused despair and then into pride worn sideways to keep it from getting any teeth. She smiled without letting her mouth curve overly because the city had given her a minute and she was not about to scare it off. The red boy made a show of sticking a finger in the storm drain and then yelped in satisfaction when a spark bit him and he bit it back. He would keep a pile from relighting with six rude words and a flick. He would steal hotdogs from a firefighter\u2019 grill at three in the morning and feed them to a stray who would then follow him into a story without the dog realizing his soul had been adopted by a nuisance.\n\nAt Latrice\u2019s door, Mar stood outside long enough to watch herself in the glass like a stranger would, the jacket slick and the hair done wrong by rain and the eyes a little too hungry. She thought briefly about going to the under rooms alone and leaving the Council out of it and then she remembered Sifa\u2019s wet eyes and Calendar\u2019s note-taking pride and Mr. Solomon\u2019s brisket voice and Madam Delphine\u2019s rage disguised as etiquette and she knew she would be a dummy if she tried to make herself a myth when she could be a person in a circle. The bell in the shop rang on the second tug the way it always did, consenting. Latrice lifted her head and put the pin in the turtle dish and said, \u201cYou late,\u201d like the weather, and then she looked, and then she let relief move across her face without giving it a speech.\n\n\u201cI burned and drowned and swept and I\u2019m going to sleep in fifteen minutes for forty-five minutes,\u201d Mar said, which is a sentence only a girl in that city could say with no fear of being corrected by the grammar police. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the lake at the mean five. Ernestine says bring your glare and my broom and a flavor of no that sticks.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will take a hat,\u201d Latrice said, because the right hat is a charm and a threat. \u201cYou will eat a thing with eggs in it. You will not take my green threads unless you want to see what it looks like when I choose Poly over you. You will hold still now for nine pins and I will not stab you because your aunt has manners.\u201d\n\nMar held still. She let the pins slide around her and the small prick come when one of them insisted on reminding her that still is a work more than it is a state. She watched her aunt\u2019s hands move in their own language and remembered the day Poly had called her saint like an insult and understood more deeply than she had wanted to that all saints are just people with chores and witnesses. She ate eggs on toast because Latrice pressed the plate into her hands and scolded her into wanting it. She drank water because lake and rain do not count when your aunt is watching. She wrote on a napkin a list she would forget by accident because lists give magic false confidence, and Latrice put it in her pocket anyway and patted it, meaning not the napkin but the girl.\n\n\u201cGo sleep,\u201d her aunt said when she started to gather herself for the foolishness of baths at the wrong hour. \u201cYou smell like nine factories having regrets. It is almost pleasant. You will smell worse two dawns from now if you don\u2019t lose. Bring me what you can\u2019t tell anyone else. You know my ears keep secrets not like jars but like wells. The deepest trick she has is the one where she makes you think fatigue is virtue. Don\u2019t love being tired more than you love being effective.\u201d\n\nMar lay on the little couch in the back room because that was where the dress shop hid its forgiveness, and she put the ring hand on her belly and wrapped the thread around her wrist and put the key under her cheek and the tile in her palm. She fell toward sleep the way water falls toward low places, inevitable, satisfied, and humming. In her dream, the river and the lake and the storm drain and the pump all agreed to speak at once and it was not a cacophony. It was a chord her grandfather might have whistled if he wanted to call her in from the cracked lot on a night when the moon had decided to look like a bottle cap. Somewhere, the red boy stole a blanket and told himself he had been given it. Somewhere, Poly pressed her face against glass as if she were window-shopping the world, and the glass whispered back a thing from its temper the way glass does if you beg it like a child. Somewhere, a bell that was a promise instead of an alarm raised itself to the work of waking a city up easy so the day could get away with something decent.",

It had that old industrial blue to it, the kind you see in photographs of a city when photographers decide to be honest. Mar woke because her aunt\u2019s hand touched her shoulder once and never twice, and because the ring had been tightening and loosening through the last hour in a rhythm that turned into a thought as soon as she stood up. She was glued to the cushion with heat and rain and the sort of sleep that doesn\u2019t do its job; she peeled herself away and reached for the jacket before her head could tell her other clothes would be less wet. Latrice looked like sleep had let her flirt and then gone home early, hair wrapped and mouth holding back three comments and a blessing. The eggs had become a sandwich and the sandwich was wrapped in wax paper so that when the day tried to argue, it would have to stand in line.\n\n\u201cYou want me to say don\u2019t go,\u201d Latrice said without fooling herself. \u201cYou want me to pretend we live someplace else. We don\u2019t. You want me to tell you what I tell brides with last-minute ideas bigger than their budget: you can have what you want, or you can have what will work, and the difference is you. So. Bacon\u2019s in there because magic eats bacon. Hat\u2019s on the hook. I will be mad if you die and madder if you\u2019re late.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am always late,\u201d Mar said, which was a joke with teeth and a liturgy in this family. She tucked the sandwich in the jacket pocket going left and the tile went pocket right, because certain instincts come down in the blood as if someone had bothered to write them, and the thread settled along her collar like it knew which clavicle had been patient all its life. She took the hat because her aunt had given it the tone of a sacrament and because its brim would insult the rain in exactly the way that felt right. On the way out, she stopped with her hand on the door and swallowed the stupid wish that this would be the kind of day that ends over chess with elders and not under a sky that liked to bite.\n\nVernor in the not-quite morning gave off its particular litany: the truck just a little too early because someone liked his route done by nine, the cat who considered delivery vans an affront to sovereignty, the man unlocking the pawn shop with the down-to-bone caution of someone who has met locks at their worst. Big Mike waited in front of the shop like he had always belonged to the sun-up and had been kindly letting it pretend otherwise. He had traded last night\u2019s hat for a knit cap a niece had made with love and mistakes, and his cooler looked lighter and yet still present in the way drums are when there isn\u2019t a drum anywhere near a room.\n\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t going by yourself to tell a lake what to do,\u201d he said before hello, and she couldn\u2019t argue if she wanted to because he had already started walking like a song leads a parade. He had brought three fishing bells and tied them on a piece of cord that dangled from his big hand. They clacked and yawned in a way that would call something, and today that something deserved to be named. He did not ask for permission to come because men like Big Mike do not need to ask when a city has already stamped approval on their soles.\n\nThey cut south and east along the streets still crisp with truck-breakfasts and middle-aged sneakers. A bus coughed and carried on and a woman on the corner sold coffee from a thermos to men who had left their own kitchens for reasons they were not going to discuss. At the bridge over the tracks, Sifa popped up from the stair down into a daylight no one had requested. She had a backpack that had seen things and two paper bags that smelled like spice in the right direction. Her hair was tied back with ribbon made out of magazine strips and wanting.\n\n\u201cMadam sent me,\u201d she said, not out of breath and proud because all apprentices understand when they have been given a dangerous errand. \u201cFor your pocket. For yours.\u201d She handed Mar a small jar with a screw-top lid that had lavender heads pressed under the glass the way aunties keep summer in tiny prisons. To Mike she gave a thin tin that rattled like seeds. \u201cDon\u2019t eat it unless the day tries to talk you into forgetting what you are calling.\u201d She didn\u2019t explain, and they didn\u2019t ask.\n\nThe river still wore its storm. Clouds sat on it like aunties on bleachers, legs crossed, disapproving of your shortcuts, praising your effort when no one could hear. The line boat bobbed at the dock with the two men from last night and a third who looked as if he had made peace with emergency as a way of life but hadn\u2019t forgiven it. The pilot flicked ash off a cigarette in a practiced arc and jerked her chin at Ernestine, who stood with her keys like a rosary nobody could have. Ernestine had not slept; she had the glow of a woman whose work had been both recognized and insufficient, and she had acquired, somewhere between midnight and now, a new voice in her back pocket that she was keeping for later.\n\n\u201cYou brought a chorus,\u201d she said, appreciative because trouble without accompaniment is just trouble. \u201cWe got forty minutes before the east wind knows we\u2019re trying to be clever. The pumps\u2019ll give us clean pushes if you give them a song. Poly\u2019s been seeding the downspouts while you were dreaming of being competent. She put in her hands where roofs kiss the day. We\u2019ll go lay a line and ask the lake to do the right thing while pretending it wanted to anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s the other?\u201d Big Mike asked, nodding toward the woman sitting on the bollard who wore rain the way some people wear perfume and had a chain of keys that made Ernestine\u2019s look like an ankle bracelet. She was thin and wide at the same time, like a door left open onto a field, her coat an old municipal blue with a patch where a city\u2019s name had been and was now a story. Her hair had been braided and let go and braided again until it had learned the language of focus. Her mouth held the kind of smile you get from being right about something people don\u2019t want you to be right about.\n\n\u201cGeneva,\u201d Ernestine said without adding last names nobody would remember. \u201cShe keeps our doors remembering they\u2019re doors. She don\u2019t like being called queen of nothing, so call her what she asks. Genny, some days. Ma\u2019am if you are messing up. She\u2019s the one taught the under rooms how to throw a bell that wouldn\u2019t break teeth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like names,\u201d Geneva said, and her voice had that floorboard creak that lets you know when a house is about to hold you instead of drop you. \u201cBut I like work more. Get on the boat. Talk less unless what you have got to say can be tied to something. Girl, don\u2019t stare. Those are keys. They open doors and they make noise. Sometimes making noise does more than opening doors.\u201d\n\nThey boarded, and the boat shoved into the river like an apology that covers more than it requires. The east leaned its shoulder against the wind and called the play. The pilot let the motor know she considered it family, and it behaved. Geneva sat with one knee up and one hand curled around the edge of the bench and did not look at the water because she had learned not to give it what it asked for when it asked for too much. Big Mike tied his bells around the cleat and let them jingle themselves into a rhythm that the pumps recognized and then pretended to have invented. Ernestine\u2019s keys chattered with approval the way a grandmother fusses and makes you a sandwich after yelling.\n\nMar stood with her hat brim taking an attitude and her hand out for the air to push against. The ring was already working, calling up the up-down in her wrist, and the thread was humming with that little impatient throaty sound you hear from a singer who knows the choir is about to miss their cue. She didn\u2019t call the broom. Not yet. She wanted her hands open for now, for the thread and the key and the tile and whatever habit the lake was about to throw into her mouth uninvited. Poly was in the current the way sugar is in milk when you stir it with a guilty spoon. She tasted cucumber melon in a whisper that made her think of aisles with too much light, the kind of light that makes a woman feel examined and choose the box with the flower because the flower is a comfort in a cold room.\n\nThey passed the bridge, which still liked them after last night and let them feel it. Geneva laid a palm on the rail and said, not loud, not soft, \u201cYou old liar-catchers. If she tells you she is cleaning, you don\u2019t believe it. If he tells you the wind is his friend, you don\u2019t believe it. You believe in bolts. That\u2019s all I ask.\u201d The bridge liked being told to do small things. Small things you can do forever if you aren\u2019t bored.\n\nOut where the river changes its mind and thinks of being lake, there were the presents Poly had promised: wrinkled white bodies like tire swings in winter, slicks that held together in defense against being noticed, little curls of cellophane that looked for hands. The booms they\u2019d set last night held what they could and were offended by what they could not; the pumps brought their push at a tempo that was slightly faster than dignity and made Ernestine grin despite her training. The pilot did not say anything annoying; she set a line and held it as if she were already remembering the story she was going to tell someone later wherein she was the smallest bit heroic.\n\n\u201cStart with your line,\u201d Geneva said, and there was no ceremony to it because ceremony can stand in the way of the first stitch. Mar pulled the spool\u2019s thread free and tied it to the bit of rail the boat called its center. She let the line flutter until it found the wind that behaved. It went out into the damp like a vein, navy against gray, less a color and more a memory of color. It landed on the water where a wrinkle waited to swallow it and did not drown. Threads have their own buoyancy if you feed them names.\n\n\u201cSay it,\u201d Big Mike urged, and he didn\u2019t mean a magic trick. He meant the thing mothers say when kids stand at the door pretending they are not going to leave their jacket. He meant something useful, not pretty.\n\n\u201cLake St. Clair is listening,\u201d Geneva said to nobody and everybody. \u201cKids are waking. City\u2019s got asphalt hair matted from its bad dreams. We\u2019re asking for a smooth part and a long braid. Not a speech. A practical.\u201d\n\nMar\u2019s mouth wanted a phrase with lace. She gave it a list. \u201cStorm sewer at Bellevue. Downspout at the flower market. The alley behind the diner on Fort with the grease bucket that never keeps its lid. The big mouth at Connors. Every roof that said it was fine and wasn\u2019t and pretended. The red boy\u2019s hands when he\u2019s polite. The boy\u2019s hands at the island holding net and not wanting to. Ernestine\u2019s lever. Mr. Solomon\u2019s knives. The weight of my aunt\u2019s turtles. The old ring that makes the pumps remember when they were new and humble. The bell. The bell says now.\u201d\n\nShe flicked the line toward the widest slick and watched it take like a stitch in a seam you\u2019re trying to lie to. It colored the surface where Poly had tightened her habit and told the lake where to push. The ring heated slow and true, the way a radiator does when old houses figure out whether you deserve warmth. Geneva\u2019s keys weighed down the air and then lightened it, and Ernestine nodded only when she couldn\u2019t help it because the pumps were whistling under their breath and acknowledging the rhythm she had taught them to like. Big Mike took his bells and shook them in a pattern the bell in her ribs recognized as rude on purpose, the kind of rude that wakes a neighbor and reminds him he loves you.\n\nThe first move out of Poly came as a charm. On the skin of the slick, little blossoms kissed themselves into being, the shape of those flowers printed on bags that mean \u201corganic\u201d when what they mean is \u201cstill plastic but with better font.\u201d It was the kind of beauty that gets people to let their guard down right before they eat what isn\u2019t food. The blossoms multiplied as if buttoned down a cardigan left in the dryer too long. They bobbed in the morning like someone had set a wedding on the water. The pilot swore into her cigarette and did not share the wording because the men had work to do and did not need the entertainment.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be charmed,\u201d Geneva said, bored by the trick, which is the only saving grace of people who have seen too many tricks. \u201cPretty ways to kill are still killing. Thread to the outfall. Hello, sweetheart. No, not you. The pipe.\u201d\n\nMar put a palm on the air above the pipe\u2019s mouth as if it were a forehead she wanted to read for gratitude. The key in her pocket knocked once, and she pulled it and held it ready the way you hold a thing you might suddenly need because you have been warned all your life that someday you will need it, as specific as a spoon and as general as being decent. Poly whispered up from the outfall with all the tenderness in the world. Not today, darling, she said with a voice that sat on top of phrases and sold them, I will keep it for you. I will fold it and put it under, I will make it small. You don\u2019t have to look at it. You can sew dresses and sweep floors and drink green soda and feel like a saint. Let me do the ugly while you do the pretty.\n\n\u201cHer mercy smells like locker rooms,\u201d Ernestine muttered. \u201cAnd she\u2019s lying about ugly. Ugly is mine. Let me tell ugly what to do.\u201d\n\nPoly leaned. It showed in the way the pack of blossoms didn\u2019t drift. It showed in the way the slick held together like a stubborn chorus that refused harmony because the leader liked how her voice sounded on its own. Geneva\u2019s hands made a shape in the air that was not any sign Mar knew and all the signs she needed. The keys made that singing clink that has sent children to bed and called lovers to doors forever. Big Mike struck the cooler with his palm in a war rhythm that wasn\u2019t war because you can honor without reenacting. The ring told the pumps now, and they dug in with the sort of volontary that makes machines feel like they have souls. The thread tightened and the slick bowed to it with the insulted shock of someone recognizing the sash around a waist as a leash.\n\n\u201cDoor, not wall,\u201d someone breathed, and it could have been the red boy in a roof gutter, it could have been the bridge, it could have been a woman whose name nobody wrote down who had once held a door open for an entire neighborhood because the heater at the funeral home had died and the church had to pretend to be big enough. Mar opened her palm. She opened a space like she had on the island but larger, not by force, by permission, a widening that invited water to remember how to be a body without being asked to hold too many secrets. The slick broke along three fault lines. Geneva\u2019s keys laughed, a handful of relief. Ernestine whooped a word she was never going to admit to later. The pilot breathed for the first time like a human and not like a statue of herself.\n\nPoly came up because she had to. She came like a billboard being winched up in wrong weather, elegant in a cheap way and furious in a good one. Her dress of bags had gotten an addition, a belt made of six-pack rings cut into daisies and bitter. She floated at an angle that made her look like the cover of a magazine that had done four cover stories on the same problem and then sold ads to the problem. Her shadow cut across the water and even the gulls had to be convinced to accept it.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d she said with that television ease. \u201cYou did makeup in the dark. Cute.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou seeded people\u2019s roofs,\u201d Geneva said, not brightened by banter, annoyed the way professionals are when amateurs try to pretend the mess is a happenstance. \u201cDon\u2019t fast-talk us. Your cousins climb the downspouts when it\u2019s pretty and when it\u2019s a pain. That ain\u2019t new. You\u2019re what\u2019s new. And you\u2019re worse because you make forgetfulness feel like a chant.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople love me,\u201d Poly said with simple savage honesty. \u201cI come when they forget. I come when they\u2019re tired. I come when they mean well and all the bins are full. I come for boys with skinny wrists who have to carry groceries up three flights because their mamas are sleeping after the night shift. I come for aunties who wrap their hair and go to church and collect me neat as handkerchiefs because someday they might be needed. I am a hope. Don\u2019t tell me hope is ugly.\u201d She smiled then with real teeth and it hurt the way truth does when it is misapplied. \u201cAnd you. Little light bulb. You going to keep holding your breath over this? Let me be the deep one.\u201d\n\nBig Mike shook his bells because if sermons were going to happen, he was going to choose the choir. Ernestine didn\u2019t argue because she had a lever under her hand and because arguing with a commercial only makes it louder. Geneva leaned forward and the keys chimed once like a little alarm in the kitchen when a pot almost boils. \u201cYou\u2019re not hope,\u201d she said, patient and damning. \u201cYou\u2019re a trick. Hope takes work. You feel like hope because you feel like not doing the work. When we forget, you phrase the forgetting so it sounds like rest. Rest is not what you are selling.\u201d\n\nPoly tilted her head, made the bags on her shoulders flirt at the wind, let the cucumber melon smell bloom and then die. \u201cYou are old,\u201d she said. \u201cYou talk like someone who used to be paid to scold. These children hate being scolded. They desire to be forgiven in advance. I can do that. Watch. Girl,\u201d and she focused on Mar with sudden intimacy and infinite salesmanship, \u201cyou can\u2019t guard everything, ferry-girl. You are one set of hands. Tie pretty thread to ugly and it\u2019s still ugly. I offer ubiquity. I offer ease. I offer a blanket. Keep your broom. I will keep their guilt.\u201d\n\nIt was almost relief, the way those words slid in and offered to hold something she didn\u2019t want to hold. It came in her mouth and tasted like the first lie you tell yourself: that you will do it later and later will be kinder. The ring cooled in rebuke, or warning, or warning disguised as comfort. The tile warmed. The tile had nothing to sell. It had a picture of an iris done by a hand that had wanted to decorate a day and had achieved it with color that had never once apologized. Mar lifted the tile to her lip and let the paint remind her what dignity feels like when it\u2019s up in your nose and making your eyes water. The wind took her breath and shook it and gave it back.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to define ease,\u201d she said, and it wasn\u2019t clever and it didn\u2019t have to be. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to be a blanket. Blankets get washed. You get thrown away and pretend it\u2019s a ritual. You want ubiquity? You got it. You\u2019re a rash. We can live with a rash. We lived with potholes. We ain\u2019t dying from you because you\u2019re a habit and we know how to break those. It hurts. We got aunties.\u201d\n\nGeneva laughed then, not kind exactly, but approving like a teacher who had planned to wreck your day and then decided you had done enough on your own. Ernestine pulled the lever the way you pull a child out of a street. The pumps hit the little strobe the ring offered them, and the boat\u2019s men threw hooks with a shameful grace. The thread pulled. The slick went where water told it to. Poly\u2019s belt of rings snagged on the line that had no business catching it and did. Big Mike beat the cooler like it owed him rent and then softened his hands and coaxed it into something like a second-line he had never technically learned. The bridge groaned its approval and a gull, as rude as gossip, shat on the shoulder of the water and didn\u2019t look apologetic.\n\nPoly changed shape. She had to. You can\u2019t hold glamour when people treat you like work. She thinned and stretched and let her dress turn to ribbons that the lake smoothed without permission. She reached under the skin of the slick and grabbed at something she thought was hers and came up with the wrong prize: a single bag handle printed with a defunct logo, the red of a store that had done its damage and gone. She hissed, and the sound was less climate and more petty now, the hiss of someone who wanted the right accessory and got a knockoff. Geneva\u2019s keys made a sweet mean noise. Ernestine laughed in a way she had not let herself laugh since the water department put her on salary and told her not to have a personality.\n\n\u201cYou carry that around,\u201d Geneva told Mar, not raising her voice and making the order stick, \u201cand you feel how heavy a little thing gets. You bring it down when we go under again. We\u2019ll nail it to a door and put a saint\u2019s name on it and let people remind themselves why their hands ache. Put that handle where they can see it and call it by its bad name. Habit. Not friend. Not emergency. Habit.\u201d\n\nPoly pressed her lips together because the lake had begun to pull in a way that her dress could not like. She looked farther up the shore, past the boats and the low warehouses and the places where kids on bikes make choices. She looked toward the little storm drains that had given her fingers to wiggle, and the smell of cucumber melon tried a last trickle out of one and then ran into the lavender Ernestine had dusted there like a joke and died. She smiled then, like a woman who has been told she cannot sit in the quiet section and decides to buy the whole library. It had everything to do with menace and nothing to do with power.\n\n\u201cI will go to their kitchens,\u201d she said, sugared and soft as you\u2019d expect a breakfast curse to be. \u201cI will curl under their sinks and call this a stash. I will have their children bring me like church, expectant and regular. I will be their first piece of domestic religion. The ocean is too far. The lake is too big. The sink is right there. I will be there when they turn on the water and when they turn it off and when their eyes get old and when the last thing they carry upstairs is mine. See you under the cabinet, Marlene-with-a-T.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can come under my house if you like,\u201d Eugene\u2014Big Mike felt formally serious all at once\u2014said with a softness that hid a dare. \u201cYou will have to fit past the bleach bottle that never gets used and the steel wool that bites and the old coffee can full of nails that remembers men who cleaned their crushed fingers with spit and didn\u2019t whine. You will get whispered to by garlic and hair and soap. That\u2019s my church. You want to be altar? We\u2019re rough on our saints.\u201d\n\nPoly lifted, bag rattle sharp as a child\u2019s bracelet, looked at the boat and at the line and at the bridge and at the keys and at the men and at the pump building that had been listening to its own name all morning, and then she slid sideways like a person leaving a movie early. She let the slick go slack. She scooped with her hands at two outfalls at once and took their little lies with her. She left the blossoms and the daisies going limp in the deli-cold shade. She did not break. She was not in the business of being broken. She was in the business of coming back where you least wanted her and most expected her and convincing you those were the same.\n\nThe boat bumped back from the seam the way you do after a kiss you need to think about. The pilot put her hand flat on the wheel and let herself mutter a prayer that included the word parking as if God had a lot to do with meters. Ernestine looked at Geneva and Geneva looked at the shore and everyone exhaled in the long on-the-count-of-feelings way that keeps foolishness from having its aftershock. The ring cooled to warm. The tile stayed warm because the water wanted to be remembered. The thread lay wet and satisfied across the rail like a cat that had been useful and expected nobody to notice.\n\n\u201cBring that handle,\u201d Geneva said again, and her laugh had the sound of someone who had figured out how to make shame pay rent without making it bring its friends. \u201cWe put it where people can see. We\u2019re going under because the day will pretend it is over, and that\u2019s when the undercity has its little gossip. We nail the thing to a lintel and we tell the pipes a story that makes them want to be pushy for the right people.\u201d\n\nThey brought the boat to shore and it kissed the dock like it had been flirting with it all along. The men tied the right knots because today was not a day for playing around with improvisation. Big Mike took the bells off the cleat and put them in his pocket for the next blessing that didn\u2019t know it was one. Ernestine slung her keys around and made them settle, and you could swear you saw them settle like a dress when it finds a shoulder it likes. Geneva stood and the water had the nerve to sit up straighter.\n\nThe under steps smelled like storm and stamina. Lavenders had been replaced where they had been spent, little spikes jammed into the mortar like prayers too directly useful to be pretty. They went down with their boots saying the same thing they had said yesterday and forever: I am not enough and I am here. The room at the bottom put on its light like a collar, and the table stepped out of shadow like an old friend who likes his weight.\n\nMr. Solomon had come with a bag because men like him bring something when you invite them even when nobody invited them. Madam Delphine had changed jewelry and kept her scowl, which was simply a way to keep certain realities at bay. Calendar had a pencil stuck behind his ear because he likes props and also had a bruise forming on his jaw that said he had attempted to share too much community with someone who had not consented. Sifa came with cups and did not spill because the city likes her, and you can tell. Joe, the man who used to have a route, stood in the corner putting on a face of someone who is not going to say anything, and he wore it badly.\n\n\u201cYou brought back a thing,\u201d Mr. Solomon said as soon as he saw the handle. \u201cGood. I\u2019m not one for trophies. I am one for when you put a sign up in the kitchen because the kitchen lives with all the lies and deserves one truth on the wall. What does it say, that old print on there? Metro-Mart? I remember them. Came in promising long hours and the end of inconvenience. Left with people\u2019s pensions.\u201d\n\n\u201cHabit,\u201d Madam Delphine said, taking the bag handle as if it were a roast she needed to check for doneness and passing it back without wanting to handle it twice. \u201cWe nail it up and give it a name so nobody can pretend it looks like their favorite aunt. You know I got a white auntie who tucks her bags into a drawer and tells herself it\u2019s collection. You know I love her. You know I will call her anyway. We make it easy to point. You think easy is a swear? Easy is how we survive certain things. Not this. This requires hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can do both,\u201d Geneva said, keys talking in a small tired clatter that meant she had been asked to open too many doors in one morning and had decided to open them anyway. \u201cHard for us. Easy for people who don\u2019t know we are here and don\u2019t owe us. You take that handle and you nail it with Calendar\u2019s dramatic flourish to the lintel over the stairs going up to the dress shop. The city likes a moral where someone puts on pretty and leaves with weight. You nail another over the outfall room at the plant. You nail a third in the museum nobody goes to, the room with the boring plows, because bored people read and then act. Ernestine, I am telling you your business. Forgive me. I like telling people their business.\u201d\n\nErnestine grinned the grin that comes when a king tells you to do what you were going to do and you get to pretend you had to. \u201cWe\u2019ll put a sign by it that says don\u2019t you dare,\u201d she said. \u201cNo, Mike, not in cursive. In block. And we make people take pictures. I am not too proud for humiliations that work.\u201d\n\nMar stood with her ring cooling and the thread relaxing and the tile ready and the key warming and she wanted to sit and she wanted to run and she wanted to be small and she wanted to be terrible. The undercity liked that about her, the warring tensions that meant she was not going to be one thing long enough to be owned by it. The bell was quiet because it had spoken enough and because bells understand scarcity.\n\n\u201cWe are going to the kitchens,\u201d she said, and she could hear Poly whispering yes like she had invented the notion. \u201cNot to steal bags. To put hands in. To tell people what the bags say when they whisper in the dark and ask to become altars. We are not going to shame. We are going to be annoying. We are going to tie thread under sinks without permission like mice and like God. We are going to thank the bins that do their job and correct the ones that think a bin is a mood and not a container. We are going to make it so they get annoyed enough to do the chore because my broom is not going to fit into everybody\u2019s back pocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow you sound like me,\u201d Madam Delphine said with unflattering affection. \u201cHate it. Love it. Here. Put this in your pocket. It\u2019s a list of men you will have to argue with. Don\u2019t say their names out loud. They will show up like Beetlejuice. They all run something. They all think running something is the same as running everything. You cannot fix that. You can use it. Geneva will take you to two houses you think you don\u2019t have the right to knock on. Knock anyway. Being wrong is our work; being corrected is the miracle.\u201d\n\nCalendar scribbled and rearranged his appointment book like a man who has just discovered some dates have feelings. Joe adjusted his hat and took from his inner pocket a little wrapped thing that turned out to be nothing anyone would ever love and everything someone would need. It was a handful of those wire ties they put around bread bags, braided into a bracelet that had been made on purpose and by someone who hated crafts. He slipped it onto Mar\u2019s non-ring wrist with the gravity of a deacon in a different church and the wickedness of a boy who has stolen nothing of value and feels good anyway.\n\n\u201cFor the cabinet,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you stick your hand under where you shouldn\u2019t and something bites because it thinks you don\u2019t belong, you tell it you have a right. This helps. Ain\u2019t magic. Works.\u201d\n\nSifa took Mar\u2019s hand and put two fingers into the space where lines on a palm become confident. \u201cYou are allowed to be hungry,\u201d she said, in case no one had thought to grant this permission today. \u201cEat your auntie\u2019s sandwich. Don\u2019t let magic think it\u2019s more important than bacon.\u201d\n\nThey went up like people who knew that going down had been the easy part. The shop door hugged the first three of them and banged the fourth in a way that meant it loved them all and felt free to show it. Latrice looked at the handle laid on her counter with a face that stunned it into understanding it would be respected but never admired. She picked up three nails because the city always knows where nails are and a hammer that had been a prop until now and put her mouth into a shape that meant, if we do this we are making a promise and if we don\u2019t, I will be unbearable. She nailed the handle over the lintel with the deliberation of someone who has been building altars her whole life whether she admits it or not. She stood back and took the measure of it like a hem, found it short, and added two inches of thread knotted through the handle and around a nail on the other side.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s going to be able to walk under that without thinking about something,\u201d she declared, and when the first customer of the day came in ten minutes later and stopped under the handle and made a face she could not name and then smiled like a person being unreasonably good to her own tomorrow, they knew it had worked the right way.\n\nGeneva took them to two houses whose doors knew her keys. The first belonged to a woman who had six grandchildren in rotation, a fridge with magnets that said reasonable lies, and a collection under the sink that had been sorted by color because she believed selling scrap would save the world if enough people did it twice. Geneva looked at her like she looked at pipes, respectful and stern. Mar got down on the kitchen floor like a child playing at hide and seek and spoke to the bags in the dark, and two of them let themselves be turned into thread without ripping, and the others rustled their objections in a language nobody has the right to call mindless. They tied the line under the sink and did not say anything character-destroying, and the woman stood with her hands on her hips and did not apologize to them for being human, and that was a good fix.\n\nThe second house belonged to a boy with beautiful ears and an angry mother who thought he was trying to be good and made that into an insult because being good costs and she had been told she could not afford extra. Geneva held the boy\u2019s eye and did not look at the mother because she had decided which person she could move with less hurt. Mar tied the line under that sink and put the bread-tie bracelet in the boy\u2019s hand and said as if she were making a doodle, \u201cBefore you throw it away, just count them. Tell yourself you are measuring. If you don\u2019t like the number, call me names. I will not hear them. The number will. It listens much better than I do.\u201d The mother rolled her eyes and then saw the way the thread lay like a road and swallowed a word she was going to hate herself for if she said it.\n\nThey ate the sandwich in the alley between houses, Ernestine standing guard at the mouth like a gargoyle, Big Mike counting syllables with his bells and making them into a verse that might someday join a parade. The red boy surfaced from a basement window with a cat in his arms and a scratch on his face and said, proud and foolish, \u201cShe loved me because I lied to her right,\u201d and Geneva said, \u201cDon\u2019t reward yourself for theft, you little hazard,\u201d and he preened because he thought being scolded by this woman was the top of a mountain.\n\nBy mid-morning the city had shifted into something the rest of the world might call normal if they weren\u2019t paying attention, which mostly they weren\u2019t. Poly was in the cabinets, gentle as a saint, whispering hers. The lake sat in its old chair and refused to be interesting, which was a relief and a sermon. The pumps ran like old men telling you how they used to be athletes. The bridge kept its rot in check out of pride. The council ate bread standing up and decided to use rich butter because they had earned it and because they were petty and bold in equal measure. The bell below stopped tapping only in order to not get ignored.\n\nWhen twilight came that day, which it does even after a morning full of story, the light slid along the face of the city and made all the number five signs flip from jobs done to jobs to be done. Mar scrubbed her arms and put on a dress because the shop needed her to make three women feel not exactly like saints but like whoever they thought saints should be. She used pins without drawing blood and held her mouth the way Latrice had taught her to when she needed hands to listen. Under her skin, the ring kept the old up-down, the engine inside engines, the rhythm that made pumps and hearts and boats and even bells agree on a basic polite. Under the sink, thread lay waiting, and over the door, habit hung nailed and named and not yet ashamed enough to turn back into innocence.\n\nThat night, someplace not far and not near, Poly lay along the flat square of a tenement roof, her plastic crackling in wind that was learning its winter contempt early, and looked at the city without pretending for a second she did not love it. She loved the weakness in it. She loved the want. She loved the part where people walk into stores without bags and then look at cashiers like the cashiers could absolve them. She loved the way little baskets get carried to cars that already hold two dozen sacks, a procession of convenience humming a hymn as wrong as it is catchy. She touched her belt of six-pack daisies and it felt like nothing because it was nothing, and then like everything because it was present, and then like nothing again because the lake had taken away a piece of momentum she thought was permanent.\n\nShe rolled onto her stomach and peered over the lip at a half-hidden courtyard where a woman had hung laundry on lines that had seen better men. The laundry was not pretty, which meant it was virtuous. It had stains and it smelled like soap that had been invented by a woman with opinions about your grandmother. Poly admired it without irony and hated it with a resentment as clean as laundry. She whispered into the gutter she had chosen for her hand, and the gutter whispered back with mouse teeth. She smiled because she was in the business of coming back. She hated the way the broom had made space; she loved the way space made people forget to fill it. She planned to be a habit under the sinks, an accessory in cars, a consolation at parade\u2019s end when candy wrappers lose their purpose. She planned to be patient because being patient is a horror to women like Mar and Geneva and Ernestine and Latrice, and she counted on that horror to help her. She spoke the word ubiquity out loud and let it taste like dust on her tongue, and then she swallowed because swallowing is a power.\n\nSometime after midnight, on Ferry Street under a lamp that had remembered how to be reliable without becoming smug, the red boy sat on a mailbox and opened a pocket notebook that he had stolen and lost and found again and wrote down in careful block letters the thing the bridge had told him about liars. He underlined it twice and drew a flame next to it and then laughed at himself for being trite and then didn\u2019t care because being trite helps cut through noise when you need to scream. He wrote down Mar\u2019s name and put an arrow and wrote brooms and wrote door not wall and he wrote Poly and drew a loop-de-loop and wrote habit and crossed it out and wrote mother and crossed that out too and wrote sales and underlined it until the paper tore and then he smelled smoke where there shouldn\u2019t be any and hopped off the mailbox because nights only love people who move.\n\nThe day put itself to bed on its own eventually, the way you fall asleep in the clothes you wore because you know tomorrow may make you earn even that. In the shop, Latrice turned the sign and counted the pins and put the turtle dish in its exact place and went into the back and lay her cheek on a finished hem and said you are welcome and meant it for the fabric and for the girl and for the city and for herself. Down below, the bell did not ring; it exhaled, which is another sort of ringing, and the pipes, drunk on their own rhythm, told each other jokes that only infrastructure likes. Up above, under sinks, threads lay quiet and the bags whispered laments and lies and secrets and confessions and fairy tales about simplicity and even a few truths because even habits tell on themselves if left too long alone. The lake slept without sleeping and in its not-sleep it dreamed of what it looked like when people reminded it what blue is supposed to mean. The river mouthed names as it always does, the new ones and the old, and among them, tugged along by current and thread, was Mar\u2019s, with the T moving places like a bead that won\u2019t settle where someone crafty wants it to.",
