     "novel_text": "The night carried a hush so low it seemed the pines themselves were listening. A thousand needles leaned in, and the frogs along the ditch went still in a single inhalation of fear or awe. Under a bruised moon, an enormous man waded through waist-high grass as if he were crossing a dream, heavy and slow and sure. The boy behind the hurricane fence had climbed a stack of cinderblocks to see what made the ground thud like a heartbeat, and he kept his breath shallow the way his grandmother had taught him when the hounds ran close. Be quiet, the boy thought. Be a leaf. Be a knot in wood.\n\nSomething moved beyond the field\u2019s edge\u2014the silhouette of a billboard for cigarettes long discontinued, a metal mouth rusted into a grin. And then the figure was there under it, a piece cut out of the night. Big, the boy\u2019s mind whispered. Big is not the word. The air thinned around him, shrank away. There was a halo of fireflies hanging in astonishment, and when they scattered the boy could see hands like slabs of stone and a face most shadow, least expression, until it turned. The giant looked toward the fence as though he had been listening to the boy think. The boy\u2019s heart went sideways. A rabbit darted and tripped the wire, and the fence gave a small voice, a little zing\u2014the kind of sound you\u2019d only hear if you were waiting for it.\n\nBetween the giant\u2019s fingers, something flashed. A camera, square and old. A click like a lid closing, and another; a tiny throat of light from the body of the machine. Even at the distance, the boy knew it was an instant. Someone his age had shaken a picture like that before, held it at the edge as a face surfaced from gray. This one would not hold a face. It would hold a mouth. The boy had read about it the way you read about storms that happen in other states, sure of your safety until you are not.\n\nThe giant placed the photograph on the small of the billboard\u2019s metal leg and walked on. He had a patient stride, a metronome steady, and with each step the ground admitted he was there. The boy did not move. He wanted to call out to anyone, everyone, to the frogs even, to say he had seen the shadow in the field, the man like a moving obelisk, but the sound died in his throat as if his voice understood what his body did not: that sound would be noticed, weighed, measured, judged. The giant passed into the curtain of trees without breaking a branch.\n\nLater, the boy would climb down, circle out brave, his hands prickling with nettled leaves. He would stand before the photograph under the billboard. He would see a mouth, soft and close, the lips pressed together as if to keep in a secret. The mouth was not smiling. The mouth was alone. He would not touch the little square. He would run and run and tell, words jamming against his teeth like fish wanting back to water. He would be believed, and he would not. In a town where belief and disbelief braided like river strands, both true and untrue at once.\n\nAt a lit table in Atlanta two days later, Doctor Winston smiled for the camera with a practiced heart. The museum had copper sconces and a grant, a leather smell of old money and newer books. She was reading from her latest, The Speaking Earth: Folklore and the Language We Live In, answering questions about accents and how words come to us like inheritable hair. Someone asked about silence, and she answered the way you answer when you\u2019ve written twelve chapters and still feel you know almost nothing. \u201cSilence,\u201d she said, \u201cisn\u2019t empty. It\u2019s as full as a concealed river. In the South, we\u2019ve made furniture out of it. We lean on it. We think it\u2019s part of the house, but it\u2019s a guest, and it has its own mind.\u201d\n\nAfter, people lined up. A woman with a magnolia pinned in her hair said her grandmother used to salt words, let them cure. An undergrad asked for a selfie, then changed her mind, then changed it back, the way fish do with light. Claire Winston\u2014she was Claire to herself and Doctor to others; make of that what you will\u2014signed her name the way her mother had taught her, with a second flourish to make it look like a thought trailing off rather than a goodbye. That was when the text came in, a number she didn\u2019t recognize, Meridian area code.\n\nYou need to come home. The words were not theirs. They didn\u2019t apologize for the hour. They didn\u2019t say please.\n\nShe found a corner and called back. The man who picked up had a voice like a boot in gravel. \u201cDoctor Winston,\u201d he said, as though he had practiced to sound like someone from television. \u201cThis is Sheriff Kline. I don\u2019t suppose you remember me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember your father\u2019s hardware store,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember the bucket of nails by the register.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s him,\u201d Kline said, with a laugh that broke in the middle. \u201cFive-gallon bucket. Ten different gauge. One scoop and you\u2019d get a surprise.\u201d He cleared his throat. Milked the pause. \u201cWe got something we need you to look at.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a detective,\u201d she said. The standard defense. Old habit.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t say you were. You know how stories plant their feet. We had a\u2014something left at the edge of a field. Boy saw it, told his folks, they called us. It\u2019s a picture.\u201d He was quiet a moment, the air on the line stretching thin. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t want to say this while you\u2019re not here. There\u2019s a way folks tell things when they\u2019ve seen, and a way when they haven\u2019t. You come see. Please.\u201d\n\nThe please had arrived. It was new. She lingered with the phone against her ear after he hung up, the dead line warm on her skin. She looked out the foyer windows at the museum\u2019s pond, a flat coin of water surrounded by ornamental grasses. A couple stood near the bench with a paper bag of pastries. They leaned toward each other; their mouths made a small oval of laughter. The parts of us that invented language were, she\u2019d always believed, born from the desire to move thought across a gap and into a listening ear. The anatomy of that wish was a mouth, a hand, an ear, a shared look, and\u2014beneath\u2014the ache to be known. She held her own mouth shut till she tasted copper at the seam and didn\u2019t know whether the taste was memory, fear, or the ends of words burning through.\n\nShe drove back the next morning, four hours of road that fell away in a gray ribbon, truncated by storm and summer. Eighteen waking hearts of her life had been spent leaving Meridian, and nineteen returning; her father used to say that was the math of being born where people think the trees themselves tell tales. \u201cThey do,\u201d she\u2019d say, and he\u2019d laugh and say, \u201cSee, you already proved me wrong.\u201d\n\nBy late afternoon, she was in a town that had never decided whether it was awake or half-asleep. The murals on empty storefronts were new, the three-footed Art Deco building was old, the doughnut shop was the same because it would be the last thing to die. Sheriff Kline\u2019s office still had the framed aerial map with a crack through the glass over Bonita Lakes, as if a miniature earthquake had been contained in the frame. He was thinner than she remembered and looked like he\u2019d spent his youth chewing bark. He shook her hand with both of his, an old habit powered by simple manners or fear, she couldn\u2019t tell.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t bring it here,\u201d he said. \u201cDidn\u2019t want to bring it through town any more than we had to. Thought you\u2019d better see it in place.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think the place matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a feeling about that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think you do too, if your book is to be believed.\u201d\n\n\u201cBooks are true and untrue at once,\u201d she said.\n\nHe grabbed his hat. \u201cYou notice how folks always quote your writing to you right before asking you to do something you don\u2019t want to do?\u201d\n\nShe thought of all the times her own words had walked in ahead of her like children tugging at a stranger\u2019s sleeve. She followed him anyway.\n\nAt the field, the grass had a habit of shining even in shadow. The chain-link fence held a scrap of shirt where someone had climbed too fast. The billboard hunched over the ditch, advertising nothing to no one, the aluminum peeling like fish scales. Sheriff Kline led her to a leg of the signpost. There, taped with clear packing tape, was a Polaroid as crisp as a seen thing. A mouth. Lips relaxed, closed. The upper lip was slightly fuller, and if she had to say anything about it she would have said the person\u2019s face just beyond the borders was young, and she wished she did not have to be the one to say it.\n\n\u201cPhotography like that,\u201d Kline said, using the word like that as if it were a species. \u201cWe got three in two months. One in Vancleave. One down near De Kalb. All at edges\u2014roads that turn into dirt, you know the type. Always high enough to be deliberate. Always sealed. No prints we could pull. No nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the child?\u201d She kept her voice in that narrow place between clinical and kind, a tightrope only a certain number of sentences could walk.\n\n\u201cMissing since yesterday. Eleven. His mama hasn\u2019t stopped breathing in, if you know what I mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said, and she did. She had been in rooms where the air had a shape made by grief and no one wanted to step through it for fear of breaking it, a glass bowl full of bees.\n\nShe didn\u2019t touch the picture. She bent closer, reading the edges the way she\u2019d learned to read stories. The white border had a thumb-smudge. The emulsion had a smart little leap in its surface, as if a bubble had tried to rise when it was drying. Tiny as a freckle of rain on a hot car top. \u201cOld film,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou can tell.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey stopped making this stock years back. People still buy old packs. Sometimes they store them wrong. The colors go funny. This one didn\u2019t. Whoever\u2019s doing this knows something about temperature and patience.\u201d\n\n\u201cTemperature and patience,\u201d Kline said, tasting it for clues. \u201cSounds like cooking or killing.\u201d\n\nShe looked at him and didn\u2019t say anything. The words hung there anyway.\n\nThey walked the field\u2019s perimeter. There wasn\u2019t much to see. There never is, when someone wants there not to be. At the fence line, a boy in a Braves T-shirt stood with his mother, who kept a hand on his shoulder like she meant to hold him there till college. The boy looked at Claire with solemn concentration. He had seen something and put his eyes around it to try to make it smaller. She nodded to him, and he nodded back like a little governor.\n\nOn the way back, Kline said, \u201cYou grew up with Pastor Pruitt\u2019s lot, didn\u2019t you? You know his daughter. She teaches third grade now, over at King Road.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeah,\u201d she said. \u201cWe ate our first peaches together. We built a raft that sank in ten seconds. We thought that was a triumph.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s one of the ones who called about the last photograph. She\u2019s been organizing the parents, keeping the kids off the trails after school. She\u2019ll want to talk to you. She thinks you might have a way of telling the town what this is so we can have a way of putting our hands around it. You know how to do that, they say.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know how to take a story apart and put it back together,\u201d Claire said. \u201cThat is not the same thing as catching a man.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe it is if the man is made of story,\u201d Kline said, surprising her, then shrugging, embarrassed by his own reach.\n\nHe left her at the courthouse steps with the promise of dinner in paper bags later. She walked to the square where the bankers took their lunches and the pigeons wore their suits. She thought about mouths. Her mind had always turned to anatomy when frightened, the way a heart returns to rhythm after a startle by enumerating its parts. Lips, labial, labrum: the rim of a barrel, the edge of speech. The mouth was the border between the inside and the weather. On the way back to her car, she passed the window of the photography studio that had been there since the seventies. The man who ran it now kept his father\u2019s sign and his father\u2019s ways. He was in the back, repairing something with an eyeglass magnifier. He looked up and raised a hand. She walked in without quite deciding.\n\n\u201cDoctor Winston,\u201d he said, knowing her the way towns do, by accumulation. \u201cI read that one you wrote about train whistles once. That bit about the music nobody asked for.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarv,\u201d she said. \u201cYou still keep old film in a cooler?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do. I told my wife, if the house burns, I\u2019m taking the cooler out first.\u201d He smiled, then read her. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many people around here would know how to keep vintage Polaroid stock alive through a summer?\u201d\n\n\u201cHalf the teens online think they do,\u201d Harv said, \u201cbut they don\u2019t. They like the mistakes. They like the streaks and misfires. The kind of picture you\u2019re thinking of, somebody\u2019s determined. They\u2019re in love with the clean miracle of it. I sell to a club of men who meet once a month to talk about the good old days. Couple new kids. A teacher from the community college. That kid from the newspaper. And\u2014\u201d He paused, let the thought rest in his mouth like a seed he could either spit out or swallow. \u201cWe had a fellow come through with hands like they were built to hold lumber. Not from here. Asked questions. Didn\u2019t buy anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cA week. Maybe two.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wanted to know what to do if the film made the colors wrong. Asked if a cooler would keep it right. He had this way of hunching when he spoke. Like he had to make himself smaller to fit in the room.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he give a name?\u201d Her voice made the question a feather, as if it could slip past him and collect dust without stirring.\n\n\u201cAl. Said friends called him Al. That\u2019s nothing. Everyone\u2019s called Al if you look at them right.\u201d\n\n\u201cTall,\u201d she said, because saying giant in Harv\u2019s tidy shop felt like exposing something indecent. \u201cBig.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a church,\u201d Harv said quietly. \u201cHe made my ceiling look lower than it is. Even when he sat.\u201d He pointed with his chin toward the door as if the man\u2019s height might have bent the doorframe\u2019s memory. \u201cHe stared at my mouth when I spoke. You ever have that happen? People look at eyes, or they look away. He watched my mouth. I didn\u2019t know what to do with my tongue.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he buy anything,\u201d she said, knowing he hadn\u2019t.\n\nHarv\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201cHe took a picture on his way out. Asked if he could test the shutter on an old Land Camera I hadn\u2019t priced yet, lifted it without meaning to ask, like it belonged to him. It had film in it. He shot it not at anything. Just lifted it and clicked like a reflection was enough. Handed it back and left. I didn\u2019t notice till after that it was a picture of\u2014\u201d He stopped.\n\n\u201cOf what,\u201d she said.\n\nHe went to the back, touched a drawer he didn\u2019t want to open, opened it. He came out with a square in his palm. He showed it to her like he was showing her a bruise. Her mouth. The picture was of his wife\u2019s mouth in a frame on the counter. Harv had forgotten the frame was there\u2014a wedding picture. Lips made soft by the memory of a vow. The square captured only the lips, and the bit of chin, nothing else alive or showing. He had placed the photograph face-down in the drawer.\n\nShe swallowed. \u201cYou kept it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt felt like evidence,\u201d Harv said, ashamed of the word. \u201cI couldn\u2019t throw it away the same way I can\u2019t throw away the last button from a shirt if I know the shirt got lost and not worn out. It\u2019s wrong, but it\u2019s mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me take it,\u201d she said. \u201cLet me give it to Kline.\u201d\n\nHe hesitated, then handed it to her with a slight bow as if she were the kind of person who took such offerings away, cleaned them, absolved them. She slipped the photograph into the inside pocket of her jacket. It lay against her chest, cool against her shirt, as if it had a temperature all its own.\n\nOn her porch, later, Meridian dusk made everything louder: the insects, a train throat-clearing three blocks away, the tinny voice of a baseball game from her neighbor\u2019s stoop. Leah walked up the steps with the old familiarity of a girl used to walking in uninvited. She had the same braid she\u2019d had in sixth grade, just made wiser. She hugged and let go at just the right time. They sat.\n\n\u201cYou remember how you used to tell stories until my father said if you didn\u2019t finish before the biscuits were ready he\u2019d have to throw a towel over your head,\u201d Leah said.\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t know what that meant,\u201d Claire said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d have done it,\u201d Leah said fondly. \u201cWe need your stories. Not the old ones. The new ones that tell the old ones. Something\u2019s happening and we\u2019re making rules with our mouths because we don\u2019t know what else to do. We\u2019ll sing in the school gym so loud he can\u2019t hear us, someone said. And I said, he doesn\u2019t want to hear us. That\u2019s the point.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mouth as a door,\u201d Claire said. \u201cPeople always think closing it keeps them in. Sometimes it just makes it easier for the wrong person to press a finger to the latch.\u201d\n\nLeah\u2019s hand drifted to her own lips. \u201cI keep telling the kids their voices are good. That their names are a form of armor. You think that matters?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt matters,\u201d Claire said. \u201cBut armor can also make a target.\u201d\n\nLeah looked out at the oak across the street, its branches thrown wide like a question. \u201cSheriff Kline says this man\u2019s got a plan. Says he\u2019s not just wandering. Someone who walks like that,\u201d she said, meaning the rumor that had reached the town before the formal words did\u2014someone whose steps made windows remember. \u201cWhat would he want.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be heard in a way that makes silence,\u201d Claire said. \u201cThe maxim is old. Air loves equal pressure. Sound hates it. If you make enough of one, you erase the other.\u201d\n\nLeah chewed that. \u201cHe called me,\u201d she said suddenly, shocking herself. \u201cBefore the second picture. He didn\u2019t say anything. He breathed. I knew it was him. How do we know things like that, Claire? He breathed and my heart counted every breath like it could make him stop if it kept up.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou tell Kline that.\u201d Claire heard the sharper note in her own voice. \u201cYou don\u2019t keep that. You give it over.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make it real,\u201d Leah said, small. \u201cBut it\u2019s already real. I\u2019ll tell.\u201d\n\nClaire walked the blocks of her childhood that night the way one revisits a dream to look for something missed. The mills were quiet. The dome of the courthouse sighed itself into the sky. She passed the playground where she had once fallen and cut her lip on the corner of the slide. Her mother had bent to her, put her own mouth over the cut as if she could pull the pain out through the skin. The memory lit with a fidelity she hadn\u2019t asked for. It made her stop on an empty sidewalk and hold her mouth together like two pieces of a broken plate.\n\nHe was a half-mile away, stepping through the swamp\u2019s lip of cattails, moving without hurry toward the truss bridge that cut the river like a scar. Alessandro. He had been given that name in the first fever of his parents\u2019 hope, and in time he had pruned it down to Al to fit in the places where the ceiling was low. He was not from Meridian, but he was from its cousin, and a cousin will recognize a cousin even when they\u2019ve tried to change their hair and their state lines. He measured distance by what he could cross in an hour and measured people by how loud he imagined their ancestors stood under the sun and shouted. He had learned hate the way some men learn carpentry: you can build a chair, you can build a gallows, the hands don\u2019t pause to ask which.\n\nThe first time he had taken a picture of lips, it had been an accident, and it had felt, for one terrible clean instant, like invention. A woman at the bus station had laughed at someone behind him. He had turned and hit the shutter without knowing why. When the developing finished and the picture made a square world, those lips emerged like an animal in its winter den. It had felt like catching his own breath in his fist. He didn\u2019t think in words often\u2014they scuffed his brain like grit in gear grease\u2014but he thought in shapes, in the geometry of openings. A mouth was an opening. A mouth made sound, and sound had made him run from rooms as a child, belly burning. He had learned to make quiet with his hands. Now he made quiet by collecting the shapes that made noise. In the shed in the disused lot where he slept, there were sheets of photographs clothes-pinned in a neat, precise line. They were his hymnals. He did not read music. He understood arrangement.\n\nHe remembered the store man and the way the store man\u2019s mouth had made nervous ovals and moved like a small fish in a jar. He had loved the way the man stopped moving his tongue as if the tongue belonged to him and the man was immaterial. He had managed not to laugh. Laughter was for people who had mountains left to climb. He had a plan, and a plan consumed laughter like a fire consumes oxygen. It was too soon to say, even in his own head. It was never too soon not to say it out loud. He didn\u2019t say things out loud when they mattered. His father had told him, a long time before the world learned how tall he was, that anything said out loud could be held in another man\u2019s hand. This is mine, he thought, and walked on, and listened to the bridge tremble as if it had remembered something.\n\nAt dawn, Claire sat in the library archives with a pair of white gloves making her own hands unfamiliar to her. The towns around Meridian kept their own clip files; hers were no exception. She wasn\u2019t looking for him. She was looking for the phrase he had stepped out of. Monsters don\u2019t come from air; they step out of the vocabulary we swear we don\u2019t use anymore. She found a story in a 1911 Meridian Star about a man who had walked from the lumber camps to scare the townspeople with his height; she found a photograph from 1962 showing a woman holding a sign that begged someone to listen; she found a sentence from a church bulletin that asked people to close their mouths for a day to honor the dead. She circled the sentence and copied it into her notebook without knowing why.\n\n\u201cDoctor Winston,\u201d said a voice. Leah again, holding a Styrofoam cup of coffee. \u201cYou were always a morning person,\u201d Leah said, a little accusatory, as if morning itself were an opinion. \u201cKline\u2019s asking for you for a minute.\u201d She put the cup down in a crescent of papers and winced. \u201cDon\u2019t yell at me for the ring.\u201d\n\nClaire smiled. \u201cThere are worse marks than coffee on paper.\u201d She closed the file gently.\n\nKline had a room in the station he\u2019d converted into an idea room. It had a whiteboard that had known better days and a bulletin board that had known bullets. Pictures were pinned in a neat spider\u2019s web. Not the Polaroids. He was saving those for a more sterile gaze. These were locations, dates, missing posters, a map with pushpins.\n\n\u201cHe keeps to the edges,\u201d Kline said, tapping the pins. \u201cHe puts them high, like he wants us to look up. He doesn\u2019t want us to find them by accident. He wants us to find them just slow enough that he knows where we are. You see how these lines make a thing,\u201d he said suddenly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is yet. But it\u2019s a thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a circle,\u201d Claire said. \u201cAlmost. He\u2019s tracing, with the edges. Closing it by inches. Some people think if you finish the prayer just right, it comes true. Some people think if you measure the town with your feet, you own it. I think he\u2019s measuring to make a shape he wants to fill.\u201d She didn\u2019t say the word. She didn\u2019t want it to learn she had one for it.\n\nKline rubbed the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger as if he could rub away what he had seen. \u201cWe also got this,\u201d he said then, reluctant. He had a small evidence bag. Inside, a postcard. It bore a picture of a quiet lake. On the back, in a careful hand: The world is too loud. He had written it in a neat schoolboy script that made Claire\u2019s skin rise. She felt her mouth. She didn\u2019t touch it. She could not help imagining the hand that had held the pen; something so deliberate in that body felt obscene.\n\n\u201cHandwriting analysis,\u201d he said. He had already sent it.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t get him with that,\u201d she said, and it sounded cruel, and she was sorry, and she was not. \u201cHe\u2019s not someone who thinks he has to write to be known. He thinks he can push noise out of a room by walking through it. He will want us to come to him the way a song comes to a chorus. He already knows where we stand.\u201d\n\nShe went home on foot, because the air was the kind that could not move faster than a walk and be believed. A card was tucked in her doorjamb on the outside. It had no stamp. Inside, someone had drawn a mouth with a child\u2019s red pencil\u2014the roughest curve of lips, almost comic. The words below were blocky, almost gentle, almost apology, almost prayer. Your words make more mouths. She put the card on the kitchen table, and her elbows on either side of it, and rested her forehead against her knuckles. He had walked up to her house like it was an errand. He had stood under her soffit where the wasps were trying to decide if the season had ended. He had looked at her door and decided she was not home. He had not guessed her car. He had not guessed her habit of walking. He had not looked up at the kitchen window and seen her face. He had looked only at the seam, at where one thing became another. She understood something then about him that she hadn\u2019t before: he saw the world as a series of edges. He misunderstood that the center was where light collected best.\n\nShe held the card a long while and then gave it to Kline and watched his face change the way faces do when what is private becomes a civic matter. He cursed, very soft. He said, \u201cHe can\u2019t be let to decide what our words are.\u201d\n\nAt night, when the sound of her neighbor\u2019s game ebbed, when the tree frogs took the air back for their own, when the train cut through the belly of the town and made its long throat-clearing more announcement than apology, Claire lay awake on her back like a patient under old lights. She thought of the boy at the fence. She thought of her own mother, who had once told her there was no such thing as a man taller than a story. She thought of how wrong and how right that was. She pictured a man walking into a room where children were singing and raising his hands not in blessing but in calculation. She pictured him laying out his photographs like an atlas. She pictured silence rolling across a floor like a tide. She turned on her side and pressed her lips together, and listened to her own breath as if it were someone else\u2019s and she could learn how to stop it or encourage it as needed.\n\nBy morning, a rumor had raced around town that he had been seen near the rail yards, stepping along the center line of the tracks like a balance beam that only he could carry. Claire went there with her notebook, because she could not not go. The yards had the smell of iron and rain. A cat watched from a pile of pine. A man in a yellow vest told her she couldn\u2019t be there and then, when he recognized her from a picture in the paper from five years back, told her she could as long as she didn\u2019t get herself killed. \u201cThat\u2019s the rule,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cStands for everybody.\u201d\n\nShe walked along the far fence, felt the shiver of something larger. Not an engine. Something else. The sound of walking, but slower, clockwork. She looked up. The trestle cut the sky into squares. On it, for an instant, a figure. He paused, one foot ahead, a stillness like a held note. Her jaw went cold. She knew the measure of him before her eyes had the detail; the way the world under him reacted told her what her eyes needed to know. He looked down. He could not possibly have seen her face at that distance. He saw the way a mouth moves even from far away.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d he said.\n\nShe did not know that she had said anything, but something in her must have formed. The word left her without her consent. \u201cAlessandro.\u201d It was what was on his birth certificate, and if she could build a bridge to him it would be built out of the first name someone once chose with care, not the one he had chosen for himself when he decided to hide. She hated herself for it. She clutched it like a tool and prayed it was not also a gift.\n\nHe tilted his head as if he had heard a chord resolve. \u201cThat\u2019s not what anyone here calls me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour father did,\u201d she said, because she had read the census with its household names and because it sounded possible. The truth did not matter as much as the shape of the truth; it was a key; the door would either fit it or not.\n\nHe smiled, and it was terrible. Not because he bared his teeth. He didn\u2019t. He did not show his mouth at all. The smile was in the way his cheekbones made the air step back. He lifted his hand and made a small square between his fingers, and she felt her lips wanting to perform for him, to make the shape he could capture. She held them still. It was a muscle more than an impulse. She made herself plain.\n\n\u201cYou should go home,\u201d he said conversationally, like a man leaning at an outdoor table in good weather. \u201cYou should write your book.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am home,\u201d she said, and he considered that as if it were a variation on a theme he hadn\u2019t expected. Then he moved on, the trestle murmuring under him. He walked out of her frame. It was as if a ceiling had fallen and then been caught again without a sound breaking.\n\nShe called Kline with hands that did not feel like hers. She gave him everything except the part where she had said his name like she had been given it to keep. She kept that thing and put it on the shelf where she kept the glass she had used to catch hornets with when she was ten. Useless, dangerous, a trophy. She didn\u2019t know if it would help or hurt, later, to admit that she had called him that. She only knew her mouth still felt as if it had been looked at too long.\n\nThe giant\u2019s shed was a place without clocks. Time in there was counted by how fast the chemicals breathed. He hung the latest square by a clothespin and made himself not look at it. He had learned discipline the hard way, the way you learn to carry water without spilling in a pan across a field\u2014by slopping it two dozen times and being told to lick it up. If he let his eyes move over the pictures in a certain way, he could hear a kind of music; he could hear what he thought of as relief. He would not indulge. He had a plan that was bigger than relief. He cleaned the lens. He imagined the gymnasium down by the school as a mouth. He imagined it shut.\n\nHe thought of the woman at the tracks who had called him a name he hadn\u2019t earned. He had no feeling about her beyond irritation that she had bent the air in a way he hadn\u2019t chosen. He had a few words. He kept them in his pocket like a knife. He would use them once and fold them again. He did not say them now. He slipped the small camera into a pillowcase and tied it like bread for a journey.\n\nIn the evening, Leah came to Claire\u2019s porch with the news that the PTA had moved the fall festival into the gym, that the children would sing their songs early to be home by dark. \u201cYou\u2019ll come?\u201d Leah asked, and Claire said yes because saying no would be like building a door in a house with no walls. The sky had pulled itself low and purple. Someone had already hung lights. The gym had that smell of floor wax and lemon and centuries of breath.\n\nThe children lined up, ridiculous and magnificent, and moved their mouths around words about stars and corn. Claire stood beside Kline at the back. She wanted to shield them with her hands like eggs in a carton. Kline\u2019s jaw worked. \u201cWe pulled cars round the back,\u201d he said, too casually. \u201cWe don\u2019t advertise our fear. We don\u2019t not feel it.\u201d\n\nShe nodded. She looked at the EXIT signs as if they were talismans. She counted. She made a list in her head of who she could carry if she had to. She watched the doors. She could not not imagine him. She could not not imagine the sound of his step. The giant did not come. He did not come. She did not exhale. Somewhere between verse and chorus, she felt an odd calm. It was not safety. It was the opposite. It was the knowledge that he was waiting for a note they hadn\u2019t hit yet.\n\nWhen the children finished, the room spilled its applause like a bucket and everyone\u2019s mouth opened at once and the space expanded by inches because sound makes space. Claire watched the fact of it. She pressed her lips together, then let them fall apart, then brought them together again. It felt like the oldest decision in the world. It felt like a door with a stubborn latch. She left her mouth open, halfway. A compromise with air.\n\nAt home, there was a letter under her doormat. No postcard and no drawing, just a sheet of paper torn from a lined notebook. He had written two sentences, and if letters could whisper, these did. The world is too loud, he wrote again. Tomorrow, we make it quiet. The we was large and small at once, presumptuous and inclusive. She folded the paper and cried in a way she did not like to be witnessed, soundless, the body\u2019s way of letting something pass through it like weather. Then she did what she had avoided doing since she\u2019d stepped into the field with Kline. She called her sister in Baton Rouge and told her something she had not told anyone except Leah once in an unimportant afternoon when they were seventeen. \u201cI dreamed once,\u201d she said to the phone, \u201cthat I could not speak and no one noticed. It was the best dream I ever had. And then I woke up terrified. You cannot make a life between those two things without a crack.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always did like a crack,\u201d her sister said, aiming for light and landing near.\n\n\u201cNot this one,\u201d Claire said. \u201cNot this.\u201d\n\nThe next day drew itself up hot and blinding as if the sun were overcompensating for all that hush. Claire drove past the school. The gym was locked and proud. Sheriff cars hunkered at each corner like dogs. Claire parked two streets away and walked. Her shadow could not keep up. She had the piece of paper from the doormat in her pocket like a shard of ice. She stopped to buy a bottle of water from a church youth group and a brownie wrapped in saran that stuck to itself no matter which way you peeled.\n\nAt noon, when the bell rang and the sound came like a flock of birds out of a roof, she looked up and saw the trestle, the line of sky above it, the possibility of a figure slowing there to look down and measure. She looked at the mouth of the gym, hinged and simple. She looked at the mouths of the children spilling out into a hungry day. She looked at her own reflection in the library window across the street\u2014her mouth an idea, then a fact.\n\nShe heard, once, a step. It might have been a truck hitting a pothole. It might have been the beginning of the hour. She made herself walk toward the place where the sound had pointed. She knew she could not keep this man from making his shape. She could only interrupt, interfere, speak into it, make it stutter. She could make him look at her mouth instead of anyone else\u2019s. It was a terrible thought and a good one.\n\nShe did not see him right away. He did not want to be seen, not yet. He was already in the space where he had rehearsed his silence. He had measured the doors and learned their particular songs. He had a thing in his hand that did not look like a weapon. It looked like a joke. It looked like something someone brings to a picnic to make children laugh. He would not be a man who loved laughter, but he could use its shape. He placed it on the floor near the bleachers where the air might carry a surprise faster; he stood and stepped backward, measured again, listened as the room told him the endings of himself.\n\nClaire saw him then. She did, and he saw her, and both their mouths performed the only shape available to them: the opening that is not a word. She felt the three inches between them expand to take on the mass of everyone who had ever asked her to turn a story into a rope and throw it to them. She opened her mouth and said his name. Not the one he wanted. Not the one the town had fed into the rumor mill. The old name. The first best one. Alessandro. It left her throat like a sob and a verdict at once.\n\nHe flinched in the smallest way, as if someone had dropped a note of music into a room where he had been counting in his head.\n\nBehind him, Kline came into the door like a man in a story who had decided to be late only once. He had his hands open, visible, a courtesy in a place like this. It made everything slower. It made nothing safer. The room did not know yet what it was about to hold. The sound had not made its choice. The giant was taller than the moment, taller than the town, taller than the story she had brought up from the page like a bucket from a well. He smiled without smiling. He lifted his hand. He had a teacher\u2019s patience. He would instruct the room in the art of not speaking. The children\u2019s laughter rose from somewhere like an accidental choir. Claire stepped forward. Her mouth remembered the first instrument it ever was. She drew a breath that would have to be enough. She spoke as if sound could be armor. She spoke as if stories could change the weight of a man\u2019s hand. She spoke his name again. The room turned toward her like a sunflower toward a brief, wrong sun. She spoke again, and again, and felt her own words become a wall someone else could lean against for one more unbroken second.He didn\u2019t look at Kline. He looked at her the way a hawk looks at a rabbit hole, measuring not the animal but the opening it might use. His hand hovered above the thing he had set by the bleachers. It was foolish-looking the way a clown\u2019s flower is foolish until it spits acid in a joke no one wanted. A cooler, red and white, with a hinged lid and a faded sticker of a baseball team long gone to a different city. Someone had written FAMILY on the side in permanent marker as if labeling might keep a thing kind. She\u2019d seen coolers like it under tailgates and beside baptism ponds, sweating cold and condensation into gravel. There was a cord under it that winked out like the foot of a snake, and the plug found a friendly strip by the scorer\u2019s table where someone had left juice for microphones that would carry small voices into a crowded place and make them large.\n\nHe pressed the little black bud in his palm and the air pushed its shoulders up without moving. The room heard a sound that wasn\u2019t a sound; a pressure like a figured sum laid on the chest; a correction; a suggestion that the inside should meet the outside and make a treaty. The children\u2019s clapping went ragged and then stopped, like minnows ceasing at a shadow. You could feel the breath of the gym find a different direction to go. Smiles slid away not because of fear but because smiles are a kind of sound and the room had forgot the word for it. There was a half-second when the very old wood of the floor remembered riverbed; it bucked underfoot without rising.\n\nClaire did not think. Thinking belonged to rooms where the pressure was polite. She moved past Leah, who had stepped into the aisle without knowing she\u2019d done it, and reached for the fire alarm because it was near and red and everyone in the South had been taught since birth to distrust red that hangs on a wall. Her hand paused on the rectangle, the way a hunting dog pauses when told for the first time he might grab a thing and make it his. If she pulled it, she would make noise and panic. If she did not, she would help a man flatten a room. Her mouth found the sound first. \u201cClap,\u201d she said, uselessly, and then found the shape of what she meant. \u201cWrong,\u201d she said, much louder, pushing the word out like a chair into a closing door. \u201cClap wrong. Stomp wrong. Off the beat, baby. Don\u2019t count. Make a mess.\u201d\n\nLeah understood quicker than Kline did. She leapt to the edge of the lowest bleacher and windmilled her arms the way a choir director does when the choir has decided to be heaven without instruction. \u201cYou heard her,\u201d she said, and the children looked at her because they were always looking at an adult to see which way the day was tipping. \u201cDon\u2019t listen. Don\u2019t match. Do it all wrong. Make the loud that doesn\u2019t add up.\u201d She laughed in an ugly way on purpose, a scrape of sound you couldn\u2019t harmonize to save your life. The thing in the cooler was hungry for sameness. It synced to sameness like a parasite. It hated the slop of a barn band.\n\nThe nearest boy\u2014Braves shirt, the fence boy with the old eyes\u2014slapped his thighs deliberately out of time. He made noise like a drawer of spoons dropped on a tile floor. Someone beside him tried to copy and failed and that failure was exactly what the room wanted. The gym took a breath. The pressure met edges and broke like river on rock. Claire yanked the alarm then anyway, because she trusted herself to love contradictions, and the klaxon bellowed a dinosaur sound that made the device shrug, fail to anticipate, try to cancel a frequency and, because the horn modulated and lied about being steady, miss. The noise was unbearable in the way breath is unbearable when you\u2019ve been underwater too long; it hurt and it was the right hurt.\n\nKline went low and quick in a way that made you remember ribboned track meets and football practice in a life before paperwork. He had the face of a man who would apologize later for touching someone\u2019s property, and a foot that did not pause. He hit the cooler with a kick that he would feel in his hip at midnight. The lid sprang and then half-closed, then sprang again, and she saw inside a nest of ugly speakers bolted into the plastic with a patience that was a talent. There were weights to keep the box where you put it, small amplifier guts like a heart pulled from a chest. Kline tucked his hands under the thing like it was a pig at a roast and counted, one-two, with his mind, and pitched. A deputy who had been born to catch caught, and together they crabbed it toward the exit, every third step a stumble because the air does not like to let something go it has been shaping. When they got it into the open hallway, the difference was immediate; sound rushed back as if it had been waiting in the vending machines.\n\nAl did not move at first, and that was his mistake. He had expected panic. He had counted on panic. He had not counted on ugliness. He had not counted on a town choosing to be unmusical in public. He had never learned what to do with people who loved their mistakes like pets. There was a sliver of time when Claire could see him revise his beliefs, and in that sliver she knew him for what he was, which was not a god and not a monster but a man who had grown strong carrying an idea bigger than him and had mistaken the weight for virtue.\n\nHe lifted the camera that had slept in the pillowcase like bread, and the cloth fell away like a dropped handkerchief at a race. The thing was not old in the old way; it was an old model made to look chic again, married to a patience for batteries. He aimed without raising it to his eye, a shooter who had taught his arms to be eyes. That was when Claire made the ugliest shape she could with her mouth. She did not mean a face to frighten children; she meant a refusal. She let her lower lip hang like a broken hinge. She flapped her tongue like a child being cruel to another child. She refused to be a border. She refused to be a neat rim that held something back or let it out. She saw the flash be itself. She felt the small animal of light crawl across her teeth and away.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Leah said to him with a teacher\u2019s permanent hope that the word might still have purchase among the currently disobedient. It hit his chest and slid off. He had a second click ready in the muscles. Kline shouted and it wasn\u2019t a law word; it was a name he had found on an old booking sheet and promised himself he would use only if he had to make a man hear his mother again. \u201cAlessandro,\u201d he shouted, and it did what Claire\u2019s had done and what it would always do if someone said it right; it cut the air in the shape of the old kitchen his father had built, the one with the too-low ceiling and the flat smell of a sacrificed life.\n\nHe took a step back that wasn\u2019t a retreat. It was a measuring step, recalibrating how many strides it would take to leave and how many to stay. The room had found itself. Children were crying and laughing at once; a principal was counting heads with the speed of a casino dealer; a deputy was patting thin shoulders with too-large hands, trying to be many places. The fire alarm insisted on a lesson. The infrasound had fled into the hall with the cooler and died of cold. Claire could feel her heartbeat again up in her mouth where words live.\n\nHe could have kept on then. He could have done the worse thing. He did not. He slid the pillowcase back over the camera because he loved cleanliness; he loved clean beginnings and clean ends. He turned and walked the way a man walks when there are eyes and he won\u2019t give them a run. It made his height larger. He did not hurry. He did not touch a child. He passed a row of paper turkeys children had made from their hands, each with five painted feathers, and the thumbs were all too big because children mismeasure themselves. The cutouts fluttered with the wake of his passage and did not fall.\n\nClaire followed and did not know she had until the exit door slapped against her shoulder and made the bone smart. Outside, the air had a carnation pinned to it: crisp and showy. Sirens were trying to find the right street, always two turns slow because a town knows its own shortcuts better than a man in a car from the county. He angled not for the road, where hands and rules live, but for the strip of planted crape myrtles that led to the maintenance gate and then the back of the kitchen where the dumpsters stood pronouncing their own names. She had a foolish thought that he would not fit where he wanted to go. He did. The world had been building doors for him his whole life. He walked through another.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t chase,\u201d Kline said to her shoulder, and his breath fogged and made a temporary ghost. \u201cPlease,\u201d he added, practicing for a world where please might arrive early instead of late. Then he went after the man because telling someone not to chase and not chasing yourself is a recipe for being someone you don\u2019t like in your own head. He looked, in that small second, exactly like his father had looked in the hardware store when someone tried to walk out with a handsaw under a coat. Politeness first. Then a hand on the elbow that was firmer than instruction.\n\nClaire did not run. Her running would have been a gesture and she had run enough in her life to know when her running was a ritual. She walked into the sunlight with her mouth wasting a breath for every thought and let the important air go to the men who needed it to move their legs fast. Leah shepherded children with the pained, tender efficiency of someone who had birthed something with her voice and had to get it out of the dumbest river. The alarm cut off as if ashamed and the sudden vacancy made everything tender to touch. You could hear a shoe squeak. You could hear a child say, \u201cMy ears,\u201d like a complaint to God.\n\nHe was not there to be caught behind the kitchen. He had learned more about exits than any room could teach. The door to the supply alley was jimmied in a way that would not show unless you knew how a hinge looks when it has been asked too much. He had left nothing, which is not the same as leaving no trace. There was a small triangle of paper on the asphalt where a hand had fumbled, torn, and not known. Claire bent without meaning to and picked it up. It was the corner of a photograph, the white border cut on the diagonal, the emulsion missing the thing that would have given it intent. It was an empty mouth. It was a frame inside a frame. She held it like a tooth and wanted to spit.\n\nThe deputies fanned, radios shedding words that meant comfort to the men holding them and static to everyone else. Kline came back with his own mouth a hard line. He did not look at her because he was gathering himself into a shape he would need to be ten minutes from now. \u201cWe did a thing,\u201d he said, and it sounded more like a question than a boast. \u201cWe kept it from being the thing it wanted to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou made it messy,\u201d she said, and realized she was shaking and could not find the place where shaking began. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way some machines can\u2019t count you.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, and the nod acknowledged a debt he had no pocket for. He glanced at Leah, who gave him a teacher\u2019s report\u2014two children left early, four headaches, one nosebleed, nine who would need a snack and a nap\u2014and he looked grateful for numbers because numbers make a fence around bad. Then he pointed with his chin at the cooler. It sat in the hall like a prop that had been caught in the wrong act. \u201cWe get this to somebody who can look at it and not see a lunch,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if the state boys have a man who knows speakers from bombs.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarv will,\u201d Claire said, before she could talk herself out of dragging him deeper. \u201cHe\u2019ll know how a thing was made if it breathes electricity. He\u2019ll know which catalogs the screws came from. He\u2019ll know who likes to order in bulk and pay in cash. He\u2019ll know the smell.\u201d\n\nKline rubbed the heel of his hand along his jaw. \u201cAnd he\u2019ll be in the middle and that is where I don\u2019t want people I know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut here we are. Bring him to the station. Don\u2019t give him the box. Let him bring his magnifier to us.\u201d\n\nShe nodded and stepped out of the path of a flood of grandparents who had heard a siren and knew their grandchildren were made of breakable parts. The street outside had filled as if a parade had been promised. People looked at each other with the naked eyes of a town that had shared a scare and would share a story and would call it something with a name that could be laid on a table without embarrassing anyone. She saw a woman touch her mouth and then double that touch with the same hand as if she hadn\u2019t got enough the first time. The crape myrtles knocked their knuckles together in an indifferent breeze.\n\nBy late afternoon the gym had been surveyed into statements. The cooler had gone to a room with a locked door. Leah sat on Claire\u2019s porch in the clothes she had put on the morning of a normal day and cradled a lukewarm bottle of something fizzy she would not drink. She had the look of someone who had used all her grace and now had to borrow. \u201cThey sang like they were going to break the roof,\u201d she said, and a flush of pride made her face look ten years old. \u201cI told them I didn\u2019t care about tune and a few of them looked at me like I had given them permission to walk on the good carpet.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d Claire said. \u201cYou gave them the trick every old woman knows in her body. When the pot boils, stick your spoon in and make a mess. The mess is part of the recipe. It\u2019s not written on the card because the card was written by a woman who thought husbands didn\u2019t like to think about the kitchen being work.\u201d\n\nLeah laughed and then put the heel of her hand to her mouth to hold in the sound as if the sound were something someone might steal. \u201cHe took your picture,\u201d she said, because not saying it would not make it untrue.\n\n\u201cHe did,\u201d Claire said, and felt the cool spot on her skin where the flash had sat. \u201cHe won\u2019t get what he wanted. Not today. I gave him the wrong shape to keep.\u201d She realized with a small grief that she had spared herself and given him another woman\u2019s mouth years ago without knowing\u2014Harv\u2019s wife. The shame moved in a circle and came back to sit beside her like a cat, uncalled and unavoidable.\n\nHarv arrived at dusk with his eyeglass in his pocket and a nervous smile that skipped a gear when it changed. He looked at the cooler with a craftsman\u2019s dread the way a man looks at a cracked vase his grandmother loved. \u201cThis is fine-print evil,\u201d he said, not to be poetic and not to be heard, but because naming is a habit his father had beat into him in the shop behind the portrait studio. \u201cI can take it apart without killing whatever you need alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need the story of it,\u201d Kline said. \u201cNot the brand names. The why. How a man with patience put himself on the floor under elementary school feet.\u201d\n\nHarv had gloves and put them on without looking down. He lifted the lid like an apology and touched the wires like they were snakes he knew by family name. He talked as he looked. \u201cHe made an array. Cheap speakers in a drum will do something; this is speakers in a patience. He nested. He damped his own casing with carpet. He weighted the corners to keep specifics. He had to test this somewhere with a big room. An empty one. He had to be a janitor or a thief.\u201d He reached in and eased a screw with the tenderness of a dentist. \u201cThe sound isn\u2019t about loud. It\u2019s about under. Low enough it makes your molecules talk to each other about quitting. Any simpleton can make a bleed-your-ears box. This is a cough in the lungs of a building. You ever set a tuning fork on a tabletop and felt the wood say thank you? That\u2019s this, rude and multiplied. If I had to say, I\u2019d say he didn\u2019t buy these speakers new. He pulled them out of things. Cars. Aerobics rooms. There\u2019s adhesive here that isn\u2019t factory. There\u2019s sawdust in the grill that came from a place with old wood. He built in a shed.\u201d\n\n\u201cA disused lot,\u201d Claire said, and felt her throat click on a remembered clause. \u201cClothes-pins,\u201d she added, useless as always and sometimes necessary. \u201cHe pins his pictures the way his grandmother pinned laundry. There\u2019s a line in that house if there was a house. There\u2019s a line in the shed if it\u2019s a shed. He likes neat. He likes neat evil. He thinks neat makes it less evil and more clever.\u201d\n\nHarv found a signature in the weld in the way a coyote finds a rabbit without seeing it. He leaned. \u201cSee that ripple. Someone did this with a home kit and nerves. He didn\u2019t sleep the night he glued. He stared at the seam and decided it was good because it was small. He had to borrow a heat gun. He can\u2019t afford a shop. He has a friend or a person he hovers near and takes what he needs from without making a ripple.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe look for garages with missing things,\u201d Kline said, and a deputy wrote it down like a prayer. \u201cWe look for sheds with new locks in old walls. We look for men who get hives in crowds and hold their breath when the choir sings. We look for someone who has made himself a room he believes is the whole world.\u201d\n\nHarv nodded and then had a thought that made his mouth go small. \u201cI should tell you I have a hole in my film cooler,\u201d he said to Claire like a man arriving late and out of breath to a confession. \u201cThe kind that happens when someone reaches and doesn\u2019t lift before the ice has had time to melt. I patched it. I didn\u2019t tell my wife because she loved that ragged blue thing. But I should tell you. I thought it was nothing at the time. A drop-in. A glance. A hand that didn\u2019t take anything because hands sometimes don\u2019t. The hole was in December. He was here before he was here.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone is,\u201d Leah said, not unkindly. \u201cThat\u2019s how stories work.\u201d\n\nThe paper worked itself overnight into the shape of a lesson. The Meridian Star ran an extra that talked about quick action and public safety and brave children and didn\u2019t use the word the town was using to itself at kitchen tables where the sugar canister lived: mouth-man. The broadcast from the Jackson station did something else; it said a new word like it had been waiting to say it: quiet-bomber. People repeated it then and dragged it like a crate to other places until it left grooves. A woman in line at the Piggly Wiggly said she always knew the gym\u2019s floor was soft and this proved it. A man at the barber said a little quiet might not kill anyone, and the barber cut his ear on purpose and pretended not to, because some statements need blood on them to be whole.\n\nClaire dreamed that night the way people dream after a building has asked their bodies to listen to a frequency they were not built for. She dreamed she was teeth in a jar, dentures in her grandmother\u2019s glass on a tiled counter, and the glass was rattling with a bus passing and the bus was full of mouths going on somewhere to be arranged. She woke with her own teeth clenched so tight it took a minute to decide whether they belonged to the dream or to her. She got up and put water in the kettle and then remembered she didn\u2019t drink tea and put the water in a glass and let it sit in her mouth the way old men hold whiskey when they mean to think.\n\nA car idled outside in the way cars idle when they don\u2019t want to admit they\u2019re idling. It had patience. It had a low niece of that infrasound but not enough to be a cousin. She went to the window in her bare feet like a person in a story who has not yet learned what happens to people in stories who go to windows in their bare feet. The street had the look of three in the morning and a cat crossed it like a rumor. The idling stopped as if it had finished an argument with itself. She went to the door later and found a thing any teenager could have made if he had been bored and wicked: a piece of cardboard with a circle cut out of it, taped to a stick. You could hold it and look at someone and make their mouth be the only thing you saw. It was greasy where fingers had held it and there was a line of pencil on the circle\u2019s edge where someone had practiced making the opening smaller and larger, deciding what was the size of a person\u2019s voice exactly. She took it inside and held it to her own face and looked in a mirror because she believed in doing the thing all the way. She saw her mouth alone and felt in her chest the awful thought a person only has once: that she could be reduced and at the same time still be herself and be asked to live that way.\n\nAt first light, she walked to the swamp path because the sun coming up over a body of water will sit a woman down and make her shut up the way a schoolteacher does. There were men there already who never slept and talked with their backs. The cattails put up their brown thumbs and the lilies pretended to be placed by a hand. There were tracks that were not deer and not man, big as the map of a hand. An egret lifted and wrote its white cursive across the pond and made mercy into a thing with wings. She stood long enough to collect her weather into something carryable, and when she turned to go, he was there at the bend, not his body but the way the air had after a tall man has walked through it and left the lint of his shape. She knew he had used this path as a drawing pencil. He had made the town lean in on its own edges to see what he meant.\n\nBack at the station, Kline had gone from coffee to water and back again to coffee because coffee was a shovel and water a towel and he needed both to move what he needed moved. He had lines on his map that resembled ribs. He had placed the locations of the photographs and the edges and the attempted quiet and the seen and the seen-not-seen in a circle that was not a circle, shy of closure by two inches that were not on paper but in rain and knees and luck. He tapped the map with a pen he chewed like a boy, left a tooth in the plastic, and finally admitted the shape that the pins were trying to tell him without being rude about it. It was a mouth. It was the shape of a mouth, traced off the city limits, edged in fields and trestles and hallways. It had a lower lip fattened by the river. It had an upper lip torn by a road project from 1989 that no one had forgiven. He had been told in school that a circle was the simplest shape and the perfect one. He had never been taught how a mouth is a broken circle that keeps a person alive.\n\n\u201cTell me I\u2019m making patterns where there are none,\u201d he said to Claire when she came in, leaning on the doorframe like a woman who had gone to the swamp because the only god she believed in lived in mud. \u201cTell me I\u2019m looking at a loaf of bread and calling it a Bible.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at a mouth,\u201d she said, and did not enjoy saying a sentence that would sound in a week like something a woman says in a podcast from far away. \u201cHe is writing a sentence you can\u2019t hear. He thinks when he closes the shape the sentence will read. He thinks the room will obey if all the lines meet. He would have completed the lip at the gym. He would have taught us to be his word. He\u2019ll try again. Soon. You will not get to him with cars. You will get to him with corners.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorners,\u201d he said, as if the word had left him a tip. \u201cHe likes edges.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe thinks the center makes agreements it shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cHe thinks edges are pure. So you put a person he cannot ignore where two edges meet. You make a junction that bothers him. You put right where a wrong wants to live and let them argue.\u201d\n\nHe stared at her as if she had given him a riddle that was also a map and also a dare. Then he laughed the way a man laughs when he is so tired his face will only go one way and it happens to be the one that hurts less. \u201cYou know what my daddy used to say about you when you were ten and wrote letters to the paper about trains being mean to the night?\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019d say, she\u2019s going to grow up to be a person the town puts to work and doesn\u2019t pay. And he was right. And I am sorry. And thank you. And do you see why I don\u2019t have a dog. I can\u2019t be responsible for anything that looks at me like that every morning.\u201d\n\nShe smiled and didn\u2019t and went to the window because the window was where she understood what scale was. In the square, a man had set up a folding table with a handmade sign that said BRING YOUR NOISE and was selling kazoos in colors that hurt. Children bought them with dimes and parent permission and walked away and made indignities in public. An old woman bought a set of marbles and taught three small boys how to let them fall on concrete to make a sound like hail in a tin roof. A boy had a cowbell and no sense of when to ring it and the best timing in the world. In a week this would be tiresome and in a month it would be a story that made people blush. Today it was armor. Today it was a bunch of edges refusing to be tidy.\n\nThe next picture arrived where it would. On the inside of a church door, high enough you had to get the step-ladder people used to twist Christmas wreaths to reach it. It was a mouth again, but the mouth had lipstick on it that was crooked, a woman\u2019s I did my best at red. The note had nothing on it except a single drawn line, and the line had a dip in it, and the dip was the truth. It was the dip in the upper lip some people had and some did not and he had made a mark of it as if to say, I can see the small things too. Pastor Pruitt took it down and held it and held it and then put it in a Bible because men like him think anything put in a Bible becomes tinder-proof.\n\nHarv looked at that one and said he could smell on the emulsion that the film pack had been opened in heat and then shut and then cooled and that the person who did it did not sweat as much as he should. \u201cSome men don\u2019t sweat,\u201d he said, and shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t trust men who don\u2019t sweat. Even Jesus sweat. Even the devil.\u201d\n\nAt night, Leah\u2019s phone rang again and the caller didn\u2019t speak again and she spoke first, because that is a trick that belongs to women who have had to learn to be brave on a page. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only person who knows how to breathe,\u201d she said into the mouth of the phone, and then she laughed in his ear ugly and wrong and made him hang up because he didn\u2019t have a box for that and didn\u2019t like his boxes to be handmade.\n\nAl walked the abandoned spur line that ran behind the old cotton compress and measured where the moonlight avoided him. He had added the gym to his line in his head and been interrupted and hated the way breaks looked in patterns. He had arranged his pieces in the shed until they matched a picture in his mind that was a sound as much as a map. He had liked the way the room had gone quiet and hated the way it had gotten itself back like a fish he had had in his hand and lost in the grass. He had re-laced his boots tighter because his feet were too big for the laces, but the act of tightening them made him feel he had caused a smaller order. He imagined the mouth closed and the town shut and the river laid down its rattle and the birds forgot to sing and the trains remembered that someone had been here before them who did not need their announcement. He thought the word we again and tried to decide whether he liked it. It was a heavy word. He liked heavy words that you could hang things on. He didn\u2019t like Claire holding his name the way she had. He would fix that. He had plans for what people could and could not say, and her saying the wrong thing had been a splinter he would tongue until it bled.\n\nYou could see where this was going if you let yourself. You could feel the jaw of the town locating its hinge. Sheriff Kline made his cars sit at corners like bookends. The school district adjusted bells until the pattern was not tidy. The doughnut shop gave away free coffee to anyone who promised to slurp and provided plastic lids with holes too big. The courthouse clock went on the fritz and no one tried to fix it for a day because it made an interesting erratic song. A high-school band slept with their instruments and practiced in the Parking Lot of Bad Decisions behind the bowling alley until the notes went wrong and right and wrong again and that was better than right. Parents who never yelled in public stood on porches and told the dark they would not be made smaller in their own mouths. It sounded corny and felt like remembering how to breathe after being startled awake.\n\nIn the hours between three and four when the body loses most of what it borrowed from the day, Claire lay on her back and stared at the ceiling where cracks had daintily been made to look purposeful and wondered what it would be like if he succeeded. She tried the thought on as if it were a shirt someone had left behind at the pool. A quiet that was not a peace but a power. A quiet that made every prayer sound like it must be whispered to be good. A quiet that made all stories ground down to their bare bones and the marrow sucked out. She hated that kind of quiet with a bone-depth hate that surprised her. She had lived her life loving hush and this thing wasn\u2019t that. She got up and went to her desk and turned on a lamp and wrote a sentence she had been resisting and it felt like a bandage; it felt like a fight. She wrote: In the beginning was the noise, and the noise was with us, and the noise was us, and we did not know it until someone tried to take it. Then she wrote: In the beginning was breath, and the breath had edges, and the edges were where we learned who we were allowed to be.\n\nIn the morning she read what she had done and didn\u2019t hate it and hated that she didn\u2019t hate it and printed it anyway because some words need to be made into paper to be heavier. She took the page to Kline and he took it like a man takes a thing that is both bullhorn and lullaby and asked if he could put pieces of it on the county website and she said yes and he did, and somewhere a woman who had never thought the internet could make her safer read it and put her hand to her chest and said a name out loud she hadn\u2019t said in a long time and the shape of the name made that day bearable.\n\nBy noon, the rumor river had decided he\u2019d be at the Rivoli, the old movie house that made promises in the twenties and concessions in the nineties and was now a church for a congregation that liked its music tinny and insistent. It was a bad rumor and a good thought; inside, the acoustics would be a bowl he\u2019d hold like soup. Kline went anyway and found nothing but hymnals with brittle spines and a scrap of tape on the stage where someone had once marked center and then decided to be off it. He stood a long time in the dim and realized he had come to love the backs of rooms. He loved the backs because backs let you see people without being seen. He had grown up in a hardware store looking at the backs of men picking nails and thought that was what law would be\u2014helping backs hold right. He had been wrong and was learning even now how to be right in a different way.\n\nToward evening, when the air went wet and the trees put their hands on their hips, a school bus driver called it in: a man taller than sense walking along the ditch by the far edges of King Road where the asphalt becomes confession. The driver had three kids left, going home to houses where a light outside made a kind of statement, and she did not stop because you do not stop for men in ditches even when the men are not giant, but she said to the radio what she saw and then she sang loudly with the children on purpose, Row, Row, Row, and told them to be wrong on the word merrily, and they were, and they loved her for letting them. Kline was three minutes behind a cloud you could watch grow. He parked angled without meaning to and put his hand on the roof of the cruiser because his daddy had taught him cars had souls and deserved a pat.\n\nClaire was already there because a woman from the PTA had called Leah and Leah had called her and the string of calls had made a braid that meant action. She stood at the fence that hemmed a pasture with cows who had opinions about nothing and everything and saw him in profile, a cut paper hero in some wrong parade. He looked at the fence the way a man looks at a line he could step over and not be forgiven and then he didn\u2019t step over because he had rules, he had his own shames. He lifted the camera like a sacrament. He made the small square with his fingers before the square plastic could honor it. He was going to take a mouth out of the air like a coin out of a child\u2019s ear.\n\n\u201cAlessandro,\u201d she said, and it was not a tool this time but a hello. He did not like that any better.\n\nHe looked at her with the kind of disdain that is only available to people who have kept themselves away from laughter for years at a time. He looked at Kline with the contempt of a man who had measured and found him wanting and then had to adjust his math. He looked past them both to a place none of them could see, and she knew what he was looking at. He was looking at the last pin on a map he had made inside his head out of a woman\u2019s greatest hope and the edges of things that did not belong to him. He was looking at the mouth he would finish.\n\nShe lifted her hands without plan and without grace and held her fingers apart in a book of a gesture. \u201cWe grew up with a rule,\u201d she said, and was surprised to hear herself go there, to those dining tables and those girls and those warnings. \u201cWe were told when the dogs ran not to run. We were told be the tree. We were told be the knot. We were told be the stone. We learned not to be the river. We learned wrong. Rivers are loud and that is why we are alive. Be the river with me, Alessandro,\u201d she said, and the words were not pretty because prettiness is something that doesn\u2019t hold in rain. \u201cBe the river once and see if it kills you.\u201d\n\nHe did not lower the camera. He did not raise it, either. He held it at a middle where men hold things they think are both dangerous and salvation. His mouth softened for the first time Claire had ever seen it soften. It made him younger and made him ordinary and made him, in a strange, unpardonable way, beautiful. He opened it and she thought for a second he might give her a word. He did not. He closed it again like a door someone on the other side had tried to open. He turned away, which is something men with rules do when they have not yet decided to break them.\n\nAfter he was gone again into the trees he did not bend, a thing happened the way it has to in a book even when the town is tired and the writer is tired and the sheriff is thinner than his suit. A woman in a house at the top of the hill where the ditch turns and a pear tree leans had lowered her mouth to a child\u2019s ear and told him a story of a boy who wanted more silence than he could carry, and the child, who had perfect timing because children are timing dressed as people, lifted his kazoo and blew a note so wrong it went right, and the cows lifted their heads, and the sound went out over the field and into the first edge of the wood and back into the ditch like a handkerchief tossed and caught and tossed. You could have called it nothing. You could have called it a seed. You could have called it a beginning the way some people call storms early to scare them away.\n\nHarv took apart the cooler that night while his wife made soup that smelled like commas. He found a scrap of cloth wedged under a weight, a piece of pillowcase torn ragged as if someone\u2019s finger had caught and someone\u2019s patience had been outvoted by someone\u2019s hurry for once. He put it in a Ziploc like a man in a TV show he had never wanted to be and drove it over to Kline who bagged it like a man who had a whole drawer of bags and then said the thing men say when they know they owe you a thing and do not want to owe anyone anything: I\u2019ll remember this. Harv went home and kissed his wife like a first date and said he had touched the edge of a story and not been cut and she said, not today, and it was the most accurate prayer anyone had offered in town.\n\nWhoever was supposed to be keeping the fire in heaven lifted it then, a small, red, velvet corner of a sunset that made an oath it could not keep. Claire sat at her desk and wrote the chapter she had been putting off, the one about silence as furniture, the one about the kind of quiet that is a guest with a knife in his boot. She wrote about mouths without saying the word too many times. She wrote to try to arrange her fear into something that would stack. She wrote, because they would ask her to, the story of what had happened in the gym and she made of it not a brag but a recipe. She wrote: clap wrong. She wrote: break the counted. She wrote: there are men who make maps that hunger. We do not owe maps our bodies. We owe maps our ugly, square, stubborn noise.\n\nAt the edges of town, the crickets decided to tune and the frogs took their creek back and the train did its long moan and apologized to no one. In a shed that thought it was a body, pictures hung by clothespins stopped being hymnals and became a calendar. You could feel the day on them even in the dark. He lay on a cot that had more springs than mattress and counted his heartbeat down to a thing he could carry and swore to the ceiling that it would be quiet tomorrow and the ceiling rained plaster like a small studio audience expressing doubt. He didn\u2019t hear it because some men don\u2019t hear the room when the room is disagreeing. He did not sleep long. He did not sleep well. He dreamed of a river he could step across and did not know how to get his foot dry again.\n\nIn the morning the field where the boy had first climbed the cinderblocks had a small gathering whether it wanted one or not. People who lived nearby stood with mugs and opinions. A woman from the paper took notes like she was catching butterflies and planning to let them go in a lede later. Claire went alone because she wanted to see what the place looked like after being in a story, and it looked like a place that had not asked to be in one. The billboard still grinned rust. The fence still sang to the wind when asked with a finger. The boy was there with his mother again and he looked at Claire with the sacred solemnity of someone who had made a brave choice and been told it mattered. She knelt so that their mouths were closer to one another and said, \u201cYou did right,\u201d in a voice that made it sound like a secret and a proclamation both, and he nodded because children love permission and hate it equally.\n\nOn the way back to her car, Claire passed the alley where teenagers painted names at midnight and felt the air change. It was the kind of change that is only a degree and is everything. She looked up and there on the brick in white paint someone had written the oldest line in the book and made it new by facing it the wrong way. WE ARE THE NOISE WE KEEP, it said, and across town Leah read the same four words on a screen because someone had made a photograph and sent it to a friend because that is how air moves now, and Kline read it in the back of his head where officers keep their retired prayers, and Harv thought he might make a sign out of it and put it in the window of the studio, and a man in a shed misread it deliberately to keep from being hurt. He said to himself, I am not we. He said to himself, I am the quiet I make. He said to himself, tomorrow.\n\nThe circle on Kline\u2019s map still had a break at the top lip, two inches of unmade. He put his finger there and dared a man he had never met before to try it. He set two cars where streets made right angles and put a deputy at a hardware store his father used to own and a preacher at a skating rink that had been a skating rink when he was a boy and then been a church and then been a tax office and was now empty and looked like a mouth with a missing tooth. He asked Claire if she would do a thing that he had no right to ask, and he put the please in front of it like a word should be, and she said yes because she had been walking toward that yes since the first time she had heard dogs run.\n\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Leah said, with a teacher\u2019s terror that lives beside a teacher\u2019s joy. \u201cWhat are you doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to stand at a corner,\u201d Claire said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be a knot and a river. I\u2019m going to say his name where two edges meet and see if he knows the difference between an opening and a door.\u201d She smiled then in a way she didn\u2019t like and did anyway because truth lives in ugly smiles as often as it does anywhere. \u201cAnd you,\u201d she said to Leah, \u201care going to make parents practice being wrong. You are going to make them clap wrong and tell them the clap is a prayer. You are going to say the stupidest things the Lord ever blessed and you are going to save lives with them.\u201d\n\nLeah put her hand over her mouth and then lowered it and nodded and then laughed and then cried and then laughed again in a sequence that is, if you think about it, the Bible in six seconds. \u201cI can do stupid,\u201d she said. \u201cI am an expert. I have a certificate.\u201d\n\nThey put Claire where two streets kissed without privacy. They put her where the railroad cut a crossing and a chain-link fence decided not to be taller. They put her where it was ugly and true at once because ugly and true often share a bench. She stood with a paper in her pocket that said WE ARE THE NOISE WE KEEP in her own hand because she had copied it down because she believes in taking some graffiti home. She stood with a kazoo because someone had given her one and because an old woman had once said to her, take the gifts people give you even if they are shares in foolishness. She stood and waited and let the day measure her and felt the way the town turned toward her with one ear and a half. She could feel him too, out there counting, out there misreading. She had his name and he had her picture and between those two things there was a rope that could be pulled, and one of them was going to pull first. She hoped it would be her. She hoped, if it was him, that she would not go quiet. She put the ridiculous little plastic instrument to her mouth and blew once, wrong. It made a sound like a duck arguing with a door. It was beautiful. It was the beginning of a world where maybe no one had to give up their mouth to live.Chapter 6\n\nThe corner had the shabby theater of a place that had been overlooked on purpose. It was a kissing-point where two narrow streets found each other and then looked away too quickly, a railroad crossing slicing it into tinny quarters, a chain-link fence hemming a utility lot where coils of green hose went to grow old. Claire stood with her shoulder against a light pole that had been patched with a strip of roofing tin and a bolt, and when she leaned she could feel how the two metals disliked each other in a way that was intimate and permanent. Kline\u2019s people had done what they could without making a carnival out of it\u2014two cars half a block away pretending to be shoppers, a volunteer with a stroller and no baby performing the stand-and-visit that keeps a corner feeling used, an older man from the VFW who had been told nothing except that it would be helpful if he brought his harmonica and remembered nothing from the Army except he was allowed to be loud.\n\nHouses around them breathed their weekday breaths. A woman watered the square of grass between her porch steps and the curb as if the square were an animal that might bolt. A boy chalked a hopscotch course in numbers that refused to arrive exactly in order, hopping as he drew with a coordination that argued with itself and won. A man dragged a trash can that had lost a wheel and produced a beat so raggedly satisfying it might have been what a drummer hears in his sleep the night before a show he\u2019s afraid of. Claire kept the kazoo in her pocket not because she thought she would use it but because it was a promise to her own mouth that it was not only for food and apology. She watched the rail, because rails are honest outside of schedules, they tell you with a shimmer before they tell you with a horn, and she watched the fence where the world had the courtesy to declare itself.\n\nThe radio in Kline\u2019s cruiser kept up a low gossip of place-names and what-ifs, checks and backtracks and somebody saying sorry for stepping on somebody else\u2019s words. Leah\u2019s text came in like it was leaning against her leg. Kids are home. We\u2019re practicing wrong, it said, and after a beat came a picture: thirty-seven third-graders with their mouths open in wrong shapes, their hands clapped in mischief, Leah at the front with her arms wide like a conductor who had decided to conduct the weather instead. Claire smiled and this time did not stop it with her teeth. Across the street the VFW man cupped his harmonica and let out a line of something that started as hymn and ended as barn dance, a phrase you couldn\u2019t lean on if you tried. He nodded to her, and she nodded back like they were both members of a club that made whatever it needed out of what it had.\n\nAl moved like a set of measurements trying not to be seen. He came along a ditch on the far side of the tracks, keeping his feet in the beaten path that rainwater had negotiated with clay. The day tamped itself down as if preparing for someone to step on it. He had changed nothing about himself except the angle at which he held his shoulders, a small concession to roofs and wires, but even that made the air remember. He had in the bag at his back a device smaller than the gym cooler and meaner, built for corners like this, a quartet of scavenged cones set into a plastic crate that had once held oranges and now held a low lesson. He knew where he would put it. He knew what walls would help him and which would have to be taught. He had thought about this corner after he\u2019d walked it in the early part of the morning when church folks drive without looking and the dew stays on your bootlaces no matter what you do. He had put the line in his head where the map would close and then opened it a finger\u2019s width because he liked to come in sideways on his own plans, the way a carpenter cuts inside the pencil.\n\nHe saw her before she saw him because he had taught himself to see mouths from far away and the way she stood made the shape of her lower face distinct against the tired color of the day. He did not say her name in his head because names were for people who had earned them or for people you wanted to injure with the sound. He put her in the part of his mind where tools live. Useful. More useful if obedient. He adjusted the bag\u2019s strap because his hands needed order and because his father had always made him lift with both arms and so he had to be disobedient somewhere. He watched the rail. You watched the rail. The rail will betray a train before a timetable will. He did not mind trains because trains choose their own loud and have an honest horn\u2014four notes, call and answer like a riddle a child figures out by accident. He liked their rules. He did not like what lived under their rules, which was the mess of people.\n\nKline felt the change before he saw the body that had caused it, one of those policeman things that is more animal than training and which he would deny if asked and then admit on the day he filed the papers to retire. He straightened without deciding to straighten. He put his hand not on his gun but near the place where his belt holds a human still. He flicked two words into the radio because quiet talking is a kind of magic in a small town: on foot. He looked at Claire and found her eyes already on him and did not have to give her the rest\u2014the not yet, the not if you can help it, the please that he was learning movie sheriffs never say and real ones use as a lever.\n\nThe man in the ditch gained ground without gaining speed. He had a way of passing space like it was a friend you didn\u2019t hug in public. He set his foot on the rail to cross and the rail made a noise like a struck guitar and the tone was the measure of his weight. Claire felt it in the part of her chest that had learned to read lines of music in church and hated every minute and loved it too. She slid the kazoo out of her pocket and rubbed her thumb along the seam of its plastic mouth, a small sacramental gesture no one saw.\n\nHe lifted the crate and tipped it, just enough, to see how the sound would meet the brick backs of the low buildings and the underbelly of the bridge and the fence. It was all edges here; he smiled with the part of him that knew this was a good choice. He could close something at this corner and no one would call it art but it would be art anyway, the kind that makes a room obey. He placed the crate where two cinderblocks had become community by mere proximity, set to make a stand for a plant that never made it out of its black nursery bucket and had died without adding its green to the corner. He turned the knob like you turn the dial on an old radio to find something you know is there because you once loved it at night and it has to be here somewhere in the hiss. He pressed the button. The air put its palm against the room.\n\nClaire had told herself to go first and she did not. The first sound came from the old man with the harmonica, an accident that was also a lesson. He saw the man set a thing down and his mouth made a sound at the same time his hands did; it started as a note and became an objection, the harmonica\u2019s bent reed stamping its small foot in protest. It was the wrong pitch for protest and perfect. The pressure met it and tried to flatten it and couldn\u2019t decide where to put its thumbs. Claire took the kazoo\u2019s insult into her mouth and blew a note that sounded like a goose wising up. She turned her own body into a corner by pivoting and stepping into the angle of the signpost and the light pole and let the air squeeze past her, and in the slipping through the edge lost a little of its rightness, and that was the trick if there was one.\n\nThe VFW man caught on fast and wrong, which was what she needed. He took his harmonica off his mouth and smacked his palm with it in a rhythm that refused to keep company with itself. The woman with the watering can banged it against her railing because that was what was in her hand and because this town, for all its failures, had always known what was to hand. A teenager with a skateboard came realized into this corner from the next and laid his deck on its grip and slapped it with a heel, slap-slap-rest-slap-rest-rest in a pattern only he knew and which made the air nervous because it could not make a pattern of him first. Someone in the car behind Kline leaned on a horn and then took their hand off and then pressed again, four times, five times, nothing like trains and that was better here.\n\nAl felt the failure like a man feels the give of a board underneath him and knows to move his foot and knows also that if he stalls he will be thrown. The crate did its work with the dumb fidelity of the built but the corner refused to be taught. He looked not at the noise-makers but at Claire because he had already decided where the hinge was and he did not enjoy being wrong. She looked back at him with a mouth she refused to make into a symbol and he hated the plainness of it more than he had hated anything in a year. He did not lift the camera. He wanted to keep his hands for the thing that would do more. He stepped forward a single step and the world took that step like it had been practicing.\n\nKline came out of the car like he had never been in one, that clean. He didn\u2019t go for the crate because his foot told him it would be a waste to kick a rope when you need to cut a knot. He went to the man because men are where things start no matter how many machines we build to pretend otherwise. He came to stop two strides off because two strides is where a man has the dignity to choose and you have the dignity to take it away if need be. He set his hand to his side in a way that said I have it and I don\u2019t want to use it and I will. He didn\u2019t speak at him yet and that was the part of himself he did not recognize and liked. He waited in the noise and let it call him a fool and a hero and the father of all wrong children.\n\nThe train did a thing then that was strictly scheduling and purely theater. Its horn took the far crossing with the legally required measure\u2014a long, a long, a short, a long\u2014and the shape of it cut the corner open and let the pressure go running the way a bad dog bolts when the gate forgets itself. The crate\u2019s work stumbled and couldn\u2019t find its feet in the new air and by then Claire had come forward to close two human edges around it, her and Kline, a corner of bodies, the thing in the middle forced to listen to a geography that hated it. Al read it as disrespect and that was right and a mistake. He had underestimated how much a small place can want itself and how ugly it is willing to be to keep wanting.\n\nHe moved like a man who\u2019s decided that a plan needs brute in it now and reached for the crate to change its angle and Claire did the unglamorous thing and stepped on his cord. It wasn\u2019t bold; it was housewifely, and it worked because electricity loves a certain kind of insult. The plug cocked and the hum went to its knees and in the instant before his hand got to the wire he looked up at her and she said his name, not like a weapon and not like a prayer but like a gate she was holding with both hands from blowing open. \u201cAlessandro,\u201d she said, and the syllables laid themselves across his chest like a wet towel in summer and his lungs hated it and loved it because the body does not get a vote.\n\nHe jerked the plug without looking and she was ready for it because most harm is a tug and most resistance is a foot. The teenager with the skateboard had seen men yank cords all his life and had learned the counter and he slid in close and dropped his deck on top of the crate as if he were playing a game only he knew the rules to, and the sudden weight and the dull rubber of the wheels made the thing cancer into quiet. Kline put a hand on the camera not to take it or to break it but to take the aim away from it and felt the man\u2019s hand under the leather not resist so much as refuse to decide. That was the trick in him that was going to get him caught one day\u2014his love of decision until the moment arrived and then his delight in the breath before it.\n\nThe horn dragged the air like a comb through a head of hair and everything separated into strands again that you could see. The world looked cheap and friendly as it does after a scare that did not get to be formal. The old man said something like a curse and like a benediction and probably it was both exactly. Al bent in a way that suggested he could take the world apart if he lived long enough and gathered his things not because he had been beaten but because this was not the shape he wanted his failure to be. He looked down at the foot on his cord and then at the kazoo in Claire\u2019s hand and then at Kline\u2019s palm open on the camera and he put his mouth in a shape that people draw when they draw a mouth and have not looked at one in a year. Then he turned and carried his measurements away along the ditch because edge is retreat and attack both if you do it right.\n\n\u201cYou good,\u201d Kline said to nobody and everybody, the question-call of a man in charge of a room that has woken up with a bruise. The old man laughed like a rain barrel emptying. The woman with the watering can was crying from the wrists out and desisted only when she found she had set the hose down wrong and it was drowning a patch of the street that could not drown. The skateboard boy picked up his board and looked at the bottom of it as if expecting to see the imprint of the evil he had sat on. Claire breathed like she had paid cash for a breath and had better use it.\n\nA deputy who had been playing shopper came up in a posture that coupled apology and adrenaline, hands out to show he had nothing in them and so much to give. \u201cWe got a call from near the compress,\u201d he said to Kline, words sparking off his teeth because speed was not his friend and he knew it. \u201cThat old shack. The one with the tin letters still up from the tire place. Somebody says there\u2019s a kid. They heard tapping. They heard it and tapped back and it tapped like a child. I sent Rosales. He says it\u2019s the boy from the fence,\u201d he said, and sounded like he had been given back a thing he had already made a funeral for.\n\nClaire\u2019s throat made the small ugly sound a body makes when someone has removed an anvil you didn\u2019t know was there. The woman with the hose put both hands over her mouth and not because she had been told to. The old man wiped his harmonica on his shirt as if it had sweat, as if it had worked. Kline closed his eyes and leaned on their lids like he had not slept enough and would not for a while longer, then opened them and they were useful again. \u201cYou go,\u201d he said to the deputy, \u201cand tell Rosales not to keep the mother outside if he can help it. Let her in if the boy can bear it and tell him it will be ugly and right at the same time, and that is a day\u2019s work. And get the ambulance to come slow. No siren until they are a block away, because he might have had enough of the wrong sound for today.\u201d\n\nThey went because nobody had to be told twice to go toward a child they could see now in their head. The corner eased like a jaw unclenching. The train went on and made its commitments to the next crossing down. The crate sat there like a red-eyed dog, hum killed, waiting for a new instruction. Kline squatted by it and peered into its cheap heart. \u201cWe\u2019ll let Harv have the throat of this,\u201d he said, half to Claire and half to the object, and the object did not disagree because objects rarely do.\n\nHarv looked at the crate later in the day with a craftsman\u2019s calm that had a sliver of triumph in it because something had been put in his hands that could be undone without hurting anyone else. He ran a finger along the lip where plastic met patience and shook his head with admiration he did not want to own. \u201cHe\u2019s learning from himself,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is cleaner than the cooler. Less to go wrong. He made it uglier and it improved the trick. He\u2019s got a mind some part of me would hire if the rest of him wasn\u2019t taking up all the space in the room.\u201d He lifted a speaker and tilted it and let the tiny rattle of trapped gravel tell him where the man had stood when he\u2019d put the thing down. \u201cSee that? He\u2019s not as careful as he thinks,\u201d he said, and showed Kline the grit in the glue line. \u201cHe\u2019s working on dirt. He\u2019s bent over a sill.\u201d\n\nRosales came in with news that walked like it had been drinking. The boy had been found. The boy had been fed. The boy had been held in a place where holding is a verb that makes your hands hurt later. He had been told to be quiet and had obeyed the way children obey adults who sound like they know what a room is for. He had tapped with a key he\u2019d found under a radiator and had liberally misunderstood the sequence for S-O-S and it had not mattered because misunderstanding is sometimes how you get somewhere fast. He had a rope burn on one wrist and none on the other, which meant the man had taken breaks; he had laid down between his own rules. He had left a cup of water and a half-slice of bread and a small clean towel and a note in a stack of Polaroids that said, Don\u2019t make noise. The boy had made noise anyway and had saved himself by being wrong.\n\nClaire went to the compress lot because she had to see the door jamb where the hinge had been given too much to do and the sheet of tin where He had cut a neat rectangle and then slapped it back so sloppily that anyone who had ever loved neatness with a fierce love would look away. The shed in the back had his breath in it still, a mechanical smell braided with a sweetness she knew from other enclosed rooms\u2014a smell of film, that peculiar vinyl vanilla that people mistake for nostalgia and is in fact chemistry. She stood at the line where the light changed from outside to inside and saw the neat line of Polaroids clipped up like laundry and it made her stomach perform an old circus trick she had retired. There were mouths and there were mouths and there were a few false starts where the edges had bled into the border and those he had not kept. There was the one Harv had found of his wife. There was the one from the billboard leg. There was hers. She knew her mouth anywhere after the last two weeks had taught her to glance at reflective glass and not be surprised by the arrangement of her own face. He had not been content with her unjust ugliness. He had kept the one from the gym and developed it carefully and it was there hanging with the rest, the unhandsome, unbordered refusal. She felt herself split in two neat halves, one that wanted to be sick and one that wanted to stand taller. She did neither. She stood still.\n\nThe boy was in an ambulance he did not like because it was too bright and he had spent his bravery budget already. His mother had ridden in the front because the back would have embarrassed both of them and because she had been given a choice and had made it with the little spear of pride that every good mother keeps just to keep from drowning. Leah sat on the curb after and let the concrete tell her she was still heavy. She looked at Claire and the look said three things that couldn\u2019t share a sentence: why do we live like this, I\u2019m glad we do, I want it to end. Claire nodded because nods can hold three things if you make them slow. She would not cry yet, not here, not where crying would feel like making noise for noise\u2019s sake. Later, alone, she would cry and she would put her pillow over her face like a child afraid of the dark and call it a study in suffocation, as if the name could make it friendlier.\n\nThat night, the town did what towns do when the weather has lifted and they are not yet convinced it will be kind tomorrow; they went outside. They leaned on fences that had been white once, they let their dogs be unproductive, they talked across distances an arm cannot span, they ate on porches as if porches deserved to be thanked for their years of service. Someone hung a string of mismatched Christmas lights over the square and no one asked who paid the electric. The doughnut shop put a folding table on the sidewalk and stood a crockpot full of something that wasn\u2019t coffee and wasn\u2019t soup on it and the sign said FREE and nobody asked which kind of free. Harv hung, in the window of his studio, a piece of paper with the words WE ARE THE NOISE WE KEEP in letters his father would have disapproved of because they were crude and because Harv had cut them with a utility knife poorly and because the letters leaned like friends. The teen from the newspaper took a picture but did not post it online yet because for once he wanted a thing to sit in a window and be only there.\n\nAl lay on his cot in the shed and had never been more awake. The cot made a sound when he moved that was louder than the sound he required the town to give up, and the irony would have amused him if he liked feeling anything. He had not liked the way the boy had tapped. He had not liked the way his own hand had written the words Don\u2019t make noise with the care of a child copying from a chalkboard; that had been a mistake to do it himself and not make the machine carry the message. He had not liked that a rope had burned a wrist and would show. He had not liked that Claire had stepped on his cord because that was a housewife\u2019s trick and he did not want to be vulnerable to the habits of kitchens. He had not liked that the corner had refused to be a door. He said to his own chest, tomorrow, and the chest did not promise the way a mouth might, it beat, it insisted, it kept the time of his making.\n\nHe had known hunger as a boy that had nothing to do with food and everything to do with the noise adults made at each other. He had learned to sleep under a table with a hand over his own ear as if he could press the world out of his head. He had found in the photographs that there is a way to excise only the part of the face that betrays the rest. He had told himself he was an artist of reduction. He had told himself art was not cruel because art is beautiful and, like most men who tell themselves neat lies often enough, he had found ways to keep evidence away from that sentence. He did not sleep and the arrhythmic crickets in the weeds beyond the tin wall made him ache because they had charmed the night into believing they had a right to it. He would fix that. He had a line to finish. He had found the top lip on a map without letting the map know he was reading it.\n\nKline put a pin into the paper with a force that made him wish he didn\u2019t care about maps. The circle had its mouth; the line was a mouth; what needed closing was obvious now in a way nothing had been yesterday. There was the overpass near the service road that had been poured with a pride that didn\u2019t match its budget and always sounded tired. There was the water tower\u2019s ladder where no one had fixed the missing rung because everybody had memorized it. There was, most obvious and therefore least likely, the courthouse steps where speeches go to be empty and high school seniors go to find echoes they can pretend are agreement. He didn\u2019t think it would be any of those because he had learned that the man loved edges that were also private. He looked at the skating rink again on his paper and at the warehouse with the tin letters and at the rivoli and at the threshold of the gym and then he put his finger on a place he had not loved as a boy, where the drainage culvert goes under the road at King Road and opens its iron mouth into the ditch. It was private and public; it was mouth and edge; it was a sentence and a correction. He told two cars to go there and a man with an orange vest to stand on the bank and pretend to be city and a woman who could run faster than men thought to be in the shade. He did not tell Claire because he could not ask her again, not tonight, and because he knew without knowing that she would be where edges met whether he asked or not.\n\nClaire wrote until the lamp made a halo on her desk that did not belong to any saint. She made sentences and broke them on purpose and then made them again. She wrote, clap wrong, and she wrote, call him by the name he was given in the kitchen of a rented house, and she wrote, teach your mouth to be a door with a lock you own. She thought about the boy\u2019s key tapping and wrote, tap even if you do not know the code, and then crossed it out because she did not want to issue commandments and because every commandment invites a man to police it. She wrote instead, be heard crooked. She wrote, if the shape is a mouth you must refuse to be its lips. The printer made its domestic noise and she loved it like a clock in a house where someone old is sleeping.\n\nThe morning slipped over the town with a look of mischief as if to say you thought you knew afternoon? Watch this. Someone rang the church bell at ten not on the hour but because he wanted to, because he kept the key and there was nothing in the by-laws to stop him. A woman set a metronome on her porch rail and wound it and then knocked it off with the back of her finger so it swung like it was being teased. The teenagers met behind the bowling alley and tuned the wrong way and one of them remembered an uncle\u2019s CB radio and wired it to a car battery and discovered by accident that if he set it on a metal trash can, the can talked back. These were stupid things and holy ones. The town smelled like late peaches and oil.\n\nAt the culvert, the city man In the orange vest kept up a cheerful lie with his clipboard as if he counted everything and could therefore control anything. The woman in the shade twisted the strap of her sandals around her fingers and practiced not humming. The deputies in the cars pretended to be bored in the way men pretend to be brave. It was the kind of place you could close your eyes and still see because it had been in more small boy adventures than any state test could measure. The water came out and made a sound that the man at Harv\u2019s shop would call white and the rest of them would call day. A crawfish had built the kind of cathedral that only crawfish build and had decorated it with what it had.\n\nHe came because of course he did. He came because even men who think they choose their own places live in towns that have been choosing for them since they could walk. He came in the long step of someone who has learned how to use his length to look like he is in a hurry when he is not. He came with a new thing on his shoulder, a bag that had once been a mailbag with leather softened by hands, the kind of thing that makes a person look like a story as soon as they put it on. He set the bag down in the mouth of the culvert and the culvert accepted it like a communion and the air changed the way it does when rain goes from idea to rule. He had a hand on the strap when the woman stepped out of shade and said his name because saying nothing would have been a betrayal of her own throat. \u201cAlessandro,\u201d she said, and it made the culvert drop a note and pick up a new one.\n\nHe did not turn toward her. He turned toward the orange vest because the vest was a color that had been making demands his entire life and because he had never liked colors that did not occur in nature. He lifted the bag again and then he did a thing that no one expected and which, if it had been written down in a police report, would have looked like a lie. He took from his pocket the cardboard circle on a stick he had left on Claire\u2019s porch and held it up to the mouth of the culvert and framed it. He framed the mouth within the mouth and smiled, and it was a terrifyingly ordinary smile, the kind a man gives when he has remembered a joke he never got and feels proud for pretending. He set the bag down like a gift. The woman stepped backward because instinct is older than training and because the water had told her, in its way, to get taller ground. The deputies moved forward with their hands like waiters carrying trays of certainty.\n\nThe sound that bag made when it woke was a different animal. It did not push the air so much as attract the least part of it and stitch it to its neighbor and then their neighbor until the room around the culvert learned a hum that felt like being pulled through a sieve. The culvert amplified it and turned it into a suggestion that knees could make agreements with chairs. The woman grabbed the edge of the fence and let the chain bite her skin into diamonds and it kept her where she meant to stay and not where the sound would have preferred her to be. The city man made a face like he tasted cinnamon where he had expected salt. The water tried to add its own voice and discovered it had been written out of the measure and added itself anyway. It is difficult to mic a creek; he had not planned for that and for one moment he loved creek for the wrong reason.\n\nClaire did not run again. She walked fast and felt her breath as a unit that needed to be carried precious and upright and not spilled. She came to the culvert corner and did not see him first, she saw the bag in the mouth and knew it had an appetite. She went not for the bag but for the signs that said, in their old paint, City Property, because sometimes you have to interrupt a sentence before it becomes law. She swung the sign on its single good bolt and it squealed into a sound the bag could not predict because rust is an improviser. The deputies put their hands flat on the hood of their car and made a drum. The orange vest clapped the way children clap when they have been asked to show a stranger their talents and their talents are still their own. It looked silly. Someone in a house above the bank turned on a vacuum cleaner because that is what she had, and the sound bent the trees on a frequency that made the bag hiccup.\n\nAl had come for the last line and he was getting a chorus he did not want. He did the thing that he had done at the gym and which had failed there and which he believed would not fail here because men with plans always think a new room will love them. He lifted the camera. He lifted it because when he had nothing his hands could make sense of, he could always make a square. He framed Claire because that was the square he hated and wanted. He clicked and the square woke and the chemistry began to guess at what it would be and she lifted her kazoo and blew one long wrong note into the mouth of the culvert and made one child on a school bus a mile away look up because he could feel that someone was letting the air be wrong on purpose. The picture came out and he shook it not because it needed it but because men shake things when they are impatient and like to see liquid learn. He looked at it because he could not help it; he had taught himself to love the reveal more than the result. It showed a mouth; it showed a mouth; it showed something that might have been hers if she had been someone else. He had not caught her. He had caught an idea badly made, and it made him frown like a man who has stepped on a nail he meant to save for later.\n\nKline had been coming up from the under of the culvert with a pace like a man who had learned to be sure on wet concrete and at the moment the man\u2019s attention went to the square he put his hand on the bag and slid it backward the way you pull a cake from an oven prematurely and it collapsed in on the sound with such a small meekness that he wanted, briefly, to spare it. The bag whined and then lied about not knowing how to whine. The culvert was itself again and the water rushed, embarrassed by the interruption but unpunished. The city man with the vest did the brave stupid thing and kicked the bag into the shallow and watched the river make a joke of electricity and hoped for the best. It sparked like a small Fourth of July being ashamed of itself. The woman in sandals laughed and hated that she laughed and laughed anyway because her body had kept the receipt for delight and presented it at the wrong counter.\n\nAl looked at Kline then with attention and it was like being stared at by a building. There was no malice in it, only the weight of his disappointment resting on the nearest table. He put the camera back into its pillowcase because he had learned that some acts are cheapened by the air. He stepped back and it should have been a mistake because there were men who would step forward if given that permission, but that was not what this town did with permission anymore. He turned not to the road this time, not to the ditches he loved, but to the cut through the trees where deer made their own law, and he moved through it without bending a branch because courtesy was something he knew when it had leaves on.\n\nThere were a dozen reports that night of a man that tall walking that slow along the edges of other people\u2019s yards, and most of them were wrong and a few were true and all of them were proof that a town, once taught to see, will see even when it does not want to. Leah\u2019s phone lit again and she did not answer and she sat with it in her lap and said a student\u2019s name out loud and the phone went quiet and she had not known it would. Harv picked a sliver of solder out of his thumb and put it on his desk as if it might grow into a flower and closed his eyes and thought of his wife\u2019s mouth not as a picture but as the first place their older son had smiled. Kline took his map down and put it back up and put it down again because he could not bear to see the shape of the line and could not bear not to. He put a tack in the culvert and the tack pressed through paper into cork with a sound that the town would have recognized now if it had been standing exactly where he was, which it was, in a way.\n\nClaire went home by the long way because the air had gotten into her hair in a way that made going home too quickly feel like a lie. She passed the alley with the graffiti and someone had added beneath it in smaller hand: AND WE ARE THE HUSH WE PICK, and she wanted to argue with the unknown hand and wanted also to hold it. Her porch had a letter on it and it was not a letter because it had no envelope and it was not a postcard because it held no picture; it was a square like the ones on his line but it was blank and she hated that and loved it because blank is a better threat than a promise sometimes. On the back, in the neat boyish hand that did not marry the body she knew from the ditch, were four words: TOMORROW WE WILL FINISH. The we was still there and still wrong and still seductive because we is how songs begin. She brought the square inside and put it on the floor under the table where the legs had a nick in one and her mother had kept a book under it to cancel the wobble. She did not put a book under it now. She let the table wobble. She let it.\n\nMorning came with a headache and a blessing. The boy from the fence woke up in a hospital room that had been painted the impossible blue of a particular hour in a particular Mississippi spring and asked without words with his mouth for his mother and she was there and he was given a cup with a lid he did not need and an ice chip and a permission slip to be loud later. The paper ran a headline that said LIGHT STAYS ON and no one liked it and everyone kept it. The men who fix things rolled up their sleeves with a little extra civility because someone had asked them, not ordered them, to take care. The school band announced a concert at noon in the square with the caveat that people would be asked to clap like they did not know what clapping was, and parents bought earplugs and did not tell their children it was in case, they said it was for the fun of the thing.\n\nKline met Claire on the courthouse steps because some habits make sense even when they are bad, and because you can see farther and less from up there than anywhere else. He had a paper in his pocket like a teenager. He had written the names of the places he thought were left that would satisfy a man who needed to complete a shape and could not stand to be told no by corners. He handed it to her and she folded it without looking and put it in her jacket like a person who understands spells and hates them. Neither of them brought up the we in the note because words have spines and you can feel them in your throat if you say them and neither of them had time for that kind of bones.\n\n\u201cDo you think he sleeps,\u201d Kline said finally, not because it mattered and because it mattered more than it should.\n\n\u201cNot in a way that helps him,\u201d she said. \u201cNot in the way that makes a man remember he belongs to a body.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not afraid enough,\u201d he said, and there was admiration in it and a complaint and a hand he offered without offering.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid like a drawer that\u2019s stuck,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid in a way that stays useful when I need plates.\u201d\n\nHe laughed and then stopped and then laughed again because he loved being made to say stupid things that were true. \u201cYou coming to the square at noon,\u201d he said, aiming to sound casual and landing where he always did when he asked her to do a thing she shouldn\u2019t have to do: earnest and a little ashamed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather be where a map thinks it ends,\u201d she said, and they both looked at the culvert in their heads and the water tower and the skate rink and the bit of road that had never decided whether it was a street, a lane, or a place.\n\nHe gave her the look he gave people who chose to do the thing he was going to have to ask them to do anyway. \u201cDon\u2019t be brave,\u201d he said, and it landed on the step between them with a sound like a coin and like a seed.\n\nShe went anyway. She walked to the road that was not a street or a place and stood in a noon that had found a cloud and was pleased with itself for it. There were few people there, which is a different kind of courage than a square full of band. The train was an hour off and she had never been so aware of timetables that were made by men. She held the blank square he had left her and bent it once and unbent it so it would remember being changed. She thought about the first sentence she wrote after the gym and about the cruelty of fresh pages and about mercy with teeth. She thought about his grandmother or the woman who had pinned his life to a line and how he had learned to love clean things and how that love had ruined him.\n\nHe came like weather that has checked the clock. He came without a machine because he was confident that humans are machines too and he could press them. He held the camera like a dovecote and it was foolish how elegant it made him look. He stopped in the middle of the lane and the lane did not mind it, lanes are worse than roads that way. He set his eyes on her mouth and she felt it the way a woman feels the sun on the back of her neck in a dress that cost more than her paycheck really allowed. She tasted plastic because her teeth reminded her of the kazoo and she had not brought it because she didn\u2019t think jokes would help. She had brought the one thing that would make his hand tremble. She had brought his name.\n\n\u201cAlessandro,\u201d she said, and for the first time he winced and didn\u2019t hide it. He lifted the camera and she lifted the square he had brought her as if she were in on his trick and put it between her mouth and his lens and framed herself and he hated it more than he had hated anything because he had not given the permission for that framing and because she had made him a we with a cardboard circle and he was a man who had sworn that word off.\n\nThe shutter clicked and the picture came out and the emulsion began to be itself. He did not look. He saw himself, in his head, in a room with clothespins and he hated that he could hear wind through the slats. He saw his father\u2019s hand putting nails in a jar and calling it sorting and he despised the jar for its accuracy. He lowered the camera and he might have said a word then. He might have said no. He might have said mine. He might have said please. He closed his mouth around all of those words like a man closing his hand around a bee, and whether he meant to save it or kill it was not clear even to him.\n\nA patrol car turned at the far end of the lane too sharp and too soon and the driver cursed himself for stopping a poem with an engine. The horn he laid on was the wrong sound at the right moment and it tore the day in half and someone on a porch who had thought to be useless and had not been took a lid off a pot and dropped it on concrete and it skittered in a language the bag in the culvert would have hated. The picture in his hand revealed itself with a small shiver, and he looked because you look\u2014and what stared back was not a mouth. It was the cardboard ring with her fingers in focus on both sides, the cut edge of her defiance, the thing he had meant to make a tool turned into a mirror. He had caught his own shape on the inner edges where the circle framed him wrong. Behind the ring, blurred but deliberate, her mouth was open, not pretty, not clean, speaking, a mid-sound that could not be read as yes or no. He had collected the un-collectable, and the rage that rose was old and unoriginal and he despised that about it most.\n\nHe took a step that took too long and that was enough. Kline\u2019s hand found the part of his arm you can hold a man by without breaking him, and that was all it took to make the camera tilt and the square drop, and the wind, which had been sleepy, woke and took the picture a foot. Claire stepped on it not because she wanted to own it but because some things must be stopped before they join and become story. He wrenched and Kline let go because letting go sometimes keeps a man in a room better than grip does, and the next moment was no one\u2019s and everyone\u2019s, and if you asked ten people later what they had seen you would get ten true things.\n\nHe did not run and he did not stay and he did something between, a shuffling grace that got him out of the middle and to an edge, and the edge made a choice for him because he had taught edges to make choices. He vanished into the narrow green where the ditch makes a lie of asphalt. Kline did not chase because he had learned something about himself that morning, and it was that he loved his life and the count of it more than he loved arrests you boast about in bars. He would get him. He believed this with the kind of faith he wished he had for other things.\n\nClaire stood with her shoe on a picture of herself, a self-outside-of-self, and looked down at the circle, at the cut dull gray of cardboard, at her own fingers blurred, at the idea of a mouth that had been trying not to become an idea. She lifted her foot and took the square with two fingers the way you take a spider you would rather not kill. She slipped it into her pocket with the paper where she had written WE ARE THE NOISE WE KEEP in her own hand. She felt ridiculous and alive the way you do when you have been lucky and have not yet paid for it. She walked back toward the square because the band would be starting and because she wanted to hear the wrong clapping echo off the courthouse and make the history inside it roll over and cough.\n\nThey had put folding chairs out as if the town would be polite and then abandoned them as if the town remembered itself. Leah stood on a milk crate and pointed at nothing and made meaning anyway. The trumpet player who ran the tire shop blew a note that had swallowed three others on the way in and arrived fat and satisfied. Children clapped and threw away the count like a bad toy and found that their hands could make and unmake a room. Kline stood at the back with the faces he loved and the faces he had made and the faces he did not know yet, and he let them wash him in ugly, beautiful, useful noise until his eyes stung and his law loosened and tightened at once.\n\nIn the shed that smelled like sugar and trouble, a string of Polaroids stirred because air moves more in rooms that have been argued with. One clothespin, old wood with a spring that had seen better, gave up. A picture fell and landed at an angle and leaned against the leg of the table where he had placed the welders and the cutters. It was a mouth, it was three mouths, it was an error he had kept because even neatness allows for trophies of failure sometimes. It looked, in the slant, like a canyon. He was not there to see it because he was at the edge of a different room deciding how much longer he could be a man who labeled his own boxes, and somewhere in him the word we rose again, stubborn and reasonable, and he hated it and knew he would use it when he meant I, and the thought made him strong and it made him tired and the town, which had learned its shape and would go on learning, made its noise and kept it.Chapter 9\n\nMorning came on like a brass band that had stayed out late and still found its tune by muscle memory. The square wore last night\u2019s laughter like a shawl. Grocery carts rang against one another as if to demonstrate the difference between an accident and a rhythm. Down King Road, a woman hung damp sheets with clothespins that had belonged to her grandmother, and each pin clicked with a tiny, private vote for ordinary. The town had the look of a place that had been frightened into remembering that it liked to be alive.\n\nClaire woke with the ghost of a headache and the stub of an argument at the back of her tongue. The blank square from his note lay on her kitchen table where she had left it, and the corner she had bent and unbent held its crease like a healed bone. Her house had new sounds now\u2014bells she had hung on the inside of the front door that knocked together when the AC kicked on, a child\u2019s wind-up music box a neighbor had left with a note that said for luck, the anxious thrum of a fish tank someone had abandoned at the curb that she had taken in and filled with water even though there were no fish. She had made her house rude on purpose. When she stepped into the hall, her heel caught the edge of a wooden spoon she had dropped there the night before, a booby trap that was also an invitation, and the clatter made her laugh in a way closest to a cough.\n\nShe put on coffee and left it to burn while she wrote down a thought she did not trust herself to hold in her head during the half-minute it would take to pour. The dip in the lip, she wrote, and underlined it. The lipstick in the church photograph had marked the bow of the upper lip\u2014the little ravine some mouths have between nose and Cupid\u2019s mouth\u2014that had been his drawn line. His map, she saw now as if someone had traced it with grease pencil, had included that dip. You finish a mouth with a cleft. You give it definition. You make it a mouth in more than outline. The water tower had a vertical line painted down its fat belly where the city had been measuring rust the year she graduated from high school and had never painted over. The catwalk halfway up made the thin line cross the round and make a feature on a face. If you were a man who made your map out of an anatomy you hated and needed, that was where you would go to be finished.\n\nShe called Kline to tell him a thing he had already circled in his head and he did not sound annoyed to hear his own thought back at him. He sounded relieved that thoughts could be communal without making him smaller. \u201cWe already put eyes there,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they can\u2019t live there. They\u2019ll scare him wrong or they\u2019ll make it into a scene and he wants a scene. I sent a boy to sit on the hill like he\u2019s sketching and I sent Mrs. Landrum to walk her dog and I asked the mayor to develop a desire to count rivets, but that\u2019s cover and no net. He\u2019ll come in weather. He likes the air to do the heavy part. We got a storm late afternoon if the forecast isn\u2019t bragging. You know how thunder lets gentlemen do things they don\u2019t want witnesses for.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll use it,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019ll make it part of the sentence he\u2019s writing. He\u2019ll borrow the bass and give it the verb. You need to make the sky stutter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t own a sky,\u201d he said, rueful the way men get when they admit the limits of their badge.\n\n\u201cYou know people with sheet metal,\u201d she said. \u201cAsk the shop to lay out boards and hammers and tell folks to make their own thunder wrong. Ask the church to ring the bell on the up-beat and then forget the beat. Tell the band kids to bring pots. If he uses the sky, you make it answer itself in a way that messes with his grammar.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou terrifying me with how pretty that sounds,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I hear the part I need.\u201d\n\nAfter he hung up, she stood at the window and watched the neighbor\u2019s pecan tree drop last year\u2019s bad shells in a steady confession. The sky had the tight, oily look of a day that will get violent at dusk and forgive itself by dawn. She called Leah without planning to and got her on the first ring. Leah was in the gym with a handful of teachers and a custodian who had never in his life been paid enough to love the sound of a floor polisher. \u201cWe\u2019re teaching clapping like we had to teach it to foreign exchange students once,\u201d Leah said with odd cheer. \u201cWe\u2019re inventing mistakes and awarding prizes. I have never felt more useful and more foolish and I\u2019ve been a teacher in a state with a legislature.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter school, go home,\u201d Claire said, hating herself for the boss in her voice and needing it. \u201cGo home and make noise in your kitchen. If a friend comes by, let them. That thing he brings\u2014if he brings it here\u2014will like the neat of this room too much. Make it messy before he gets the chance. Teach it what a home does when it has to be a weather vane.\u201d\n\nLeah laughed, then swallowed the laugh in that involuntary way of late fear, and then released it again because the room needed it. \u201cMy father would say you\u2019re a woman with a broom telling a storm where to move,\u201d she said. \u201cMy father would be right and I love him more for it most days.\u201d\n\nThe boy from the fence asked to see Claire and she walked to the hospital with the printout of the words she had made that people had taped to windows and church doors as if paper could keep out a doctrine. He was sitting up in bed with a plastic bracelet on his wrist that made him look like someone\u2019s experiment and he had a drawing pad. He had drawn the giant wrong in a way that made it better than right. He had drawn him as a shadow with holes where eyes should be and one of the holes had a moth in it. He showed her the picture and the picture made something behind her sternum go soft and old.\n\n\u201cYou counted wrong,\u201d she said, and he looked alarmed until she smiled. \u201cYou counted wrong in the way that saves a person,\u201d she added. \u201cKeep doing that.\u201d\n\nHe bit his lower lip the way children do when they want to memorize their own faces. \u201cHe moved quiet,\u201d he said. \u201cHe looked like when the moon goes behind a cloud and then decides not to. I wanted to say his name. I couldn\u2019t think of a name for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cNames are earned,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe him one.\u201d\n\nHarv called mid-morning with his mouth full of the language of bolts. \u201cHe pulled these cones from a particular kind of sound bar,\u201d he said. \u201cNot the cheap ones. The ones with red cloth on the ends that folks buy because they like to pretend their winter is theater. There\u2019s only one place around here that still sells them because everybody else went for the Bluetooth candy. That outfit off the bypass that makes you sign for everything like a mortgage. The manager there is a man who keeps a list of who owes him. He will remember a man like a lightning rod. He will remember the way his elbows moved. He will remember whether he paid cash careful or cash sloppy.\u201d\n\nKline sent a deputy in his Sunday shirt to be nice about it and the manager remembered better than nice. He remembered a man with hands like a stovetop choosing the box with no barcode on it like some men choose seats on a bus. He remembered the way the man stood on the square of mat near the cash register and made the chime not ring, a trick that should not be possible. He remembered a name not because the man had said it but because he had said what he wasn\u2019t. \u201cNot Alan,\u201d he had said, when the manager asked if he wanted a warranty. \u201cNot that.\u201d He had smiled the way a man smiles when someone calls him handsome on the street. \u201cAl,\u201d he had allowed. \u201cJust Al.\u201d The manager gave the deputy the footage from the camera over the counter and apologized for the picture quality as if shame could make pixels grow teeth.\n\nThe state boys arrived in a car that looked like a bar of soap sharpened at the ends. They shook hands the way men who know their hands will be held in lieu of thanks shake hands. They used words like tactical and psychological operations and one of them had a degree in a thing he had never properly been allowed to love. He walked the shed and breathed the air and surprised Claire by being mournful about the Polaroids. \u201cThere\u2019s a tenderness in this cruelty,\u201d he said, more to the air than to her. \u201cThat makes it worse, or better,\u201d he added, and then took himself out of the room so he would not say something else foolish and true.\n\nBy noon, the sun had decided to preen. Heat hammered the sidewalks. The square filled with the band kids and the worst rhythm section in the county. A man from the city rolled a fifty-gallon drum to the courthouse steps and a boy with a stick made it talk and then sing and then complain. Claire stood in the back with her paper folded to a talisman and watched people she loved elect to be unlovely for an hour. It was marvelous. It was terrible. It was effective. It got under the skin of the day and made it itch.\n\nClouds muscular as men rose in the southwest. Kline pointed at the water tower with his chin in that way his father\u2019s generation had turned into art. \u201cWe do not go up,\u201d he said to the pair of deputies who were younger than his daughter would have been if his life had gone another way. \u201cNot in daylight. Not when we can see our own hands. If I can see you, he can see you. He\u2019s got the patience to wait until light lies. We can put a man at the base who looks like nobody. We can put a car a block out that looks like a car belonging to a man who doesn\u2019t like to go home for supper on time. That\u2019s what we can do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do we do with the wind,\u201d one of the deputies said, and because it was a joke, they all laughed as if they had told it.\n\nThey did what they could with wind. They asked a roofing company to lean sheets of tin against sawhorses with cinderblocks under the open ends so they would speak in a small voice when the storm slouched through. They asked a man who liked to rebuild mufflers to pretend for an hour that he didn\u2019t. They asked the woman with the church key to ring wrong. They asked the train dispatcher if the next engineer could hold the horn longer than company likes and he said he could not say he said yes and Kline said he would not say thank you, then they looked at each other in relief and guilt the way men do who are making exceptions together.\n\nClaire went home and put on her mother\u2019s shoes, which were ugly and solid and meant for standing a long time in a kitchen and she loved them for being honest about their purposes. She filled a canvas bag with things she would have mocked last year\u2014a pot lid, a rolled-up stretch of chain, a bundle of old keys on a ring the size of a palm, a child\u2019s tambourine with three of its jingles missing. She added a coil of clothesline and a handful of clothespins out of habit and superstition. She put the blank square in the inside pocket of her jacket with the corner filed toward her like a tooth and tried to decide if she was being brave or if she was building furniture out of fear and calling it useful. She compromised and called it a bench. Benches do not win wars, but they let people sit and decide to keep going.\n\nAt three, the first lick of thunder laid its tongue along the far hills. The air went greener than a living thing should be. The town found places it remembered hiding as children and then didn\u2019t go to them. That was the point. They stood on porches and left doors open and put radios on stations nobody liked and turned them up. They banged hammer handles on the undersides of tables. They loved their errors in public. Down by the tower, Mrs. Landrum let her dog pee on the same post three times in three directions and told it it was a genius and the dog believed her and wagged its tail faster than the day required.\n\nHe came when the third thunder spoke, because the third is the telling one, and because he believed in sequences more than he believed in God. He brought a canvas bag he had found in a pawnshop with a faded name stenciled on it that he had half scraped free; it had belonged to a man who\u2019d traveled for a little team that wanted to be a big team and the ghost of that ambition pleased him. Inside the bag were a ring of speakers nipple-small and rude, an array the size of a clock that had no time, a coil of wire that he had lifted from behind a print shop\u2019s broken plotter. He carried a length of EMT conduit cut with a dull blade to wedge the bag where he would need it and he carried a short-handled hammer because hammers have souls and pronounce themselves in ways other tools do not. He had a roll of tape that had been applied to other things before and took it personally, and a camera because he was himself and would always be until something interrupted him.\n\nThe tower was a town in miniature. It had habits and rules and a ladder everyone knew to be missing a rung and solved with a step wider than comfort. He moved like he had measured it in childhood and someone from a second-floor window said later that he made the ladder look like a cane for a man too proud to limp. He made no noise his own bag didn\u2019t generate. Rain began like static and then like accusation. He climbed into it because rain quiets footfalls and also because his skin had never made peace with water and he liked to punish it as if it had disobeyed him by being what everything else was made of. He got to the catwalk and let his weight teach it his name.\n\nOn the ground, a deputy with a baseball cap pulled low looked up and kept looking up until it hurt. He spoke into his shoulder and the shoulder told the next shoulder and pretty soon shoulders all over the county knew the man had gone up and what town do you know that is good at leaving it alone when a man goes up. Kline came at a trot that would cost him at eleven, running like a man who had learned to run toward because running away had always made him easy to hate. He did not look for Claire because he knew if he did he would find her and he could not afford to have two problems in the same air.\n\nClaire was already there because if she could smell rain, she could smell the place where a story decided to finish itself. She came in her mother\u2019s shoes and set her canvas bag down at the foot of the ladder like an apology and then collected it because she did not need apologies today. She wrapped the chain around her forearm and stood where the metal leg of the tower met concrete, an edge that was an edge, and she put her mouth to it and spoke his name in the way you have to speak if you want your sound to ask the thing you touch to carry it farther than you could on your own. The leg took her voice and played with it like a tuning fork testing a tabletop. The rain heard her say Alessandro and turned it into static, and up on the catwalk the man stopped without making an admission of having been stopped.\n\nHe set the bag where the catwalk curves and the line would intersect the round if you were the kind of person who drew lines on photographs with pencils. He wedged it with the conduit and taped it with the tenderness he saved for objects and never for bodies. The array had a mouth, and he set that mouth toward the town he planned to make his instrument. He flicked the switch with his nail as if nails were made for electricity and not for turnings of earth. The sound it made was not sound. It was suggestion. It was the way a room suggests people should sit, the way a church suggests hands should fold, the way a courthouse step suggests speeches are not acts but obligations, the way a father\u2019s belt suggests certain jokes are not jokes anymore. It ran along the ribs of the tower and into the ground and under the courthouse and along the clay lip of the creek and into bright kitchens and dull rooms and out through the open window at Harv\u2019s shop and made the string on the clothespins tremble like new foals.\n\nThe bells in the church couldn\u2019t find which way to fall and then did fall in a pattern you could only call a tantrum, and it was magnificent. The roofing tin rattled and warred with itself, not becoming music, refusing. The band kids beat trash cans and the trash cans remembered their first assignments in the world and did it badly on purpose. The train on the far side of town held its note too long with a willful pride no machine ought to own and then chopped it like a cheap saw and no one in the cab smiled, though later they would, alone, in their kitchen chairs. The tower stiffened like a thing affronted by insult. The array pushed and the town pushed back. It was not a draw because draw is a neutral word and nothing about this was neutral. It was a fight where neither party could touch the other\u2019s skin and made do with the things that had.\n\nHe lifted the camera not because he needed it but because he had taught every other part of himself to be disciplined and the camera was the one part he allowed to be disobedient. He pointed it at the town in general because this was not about face anymore and then he brought it back down toward specificity because he had seen, below, the one mouth that would not be fixed to his frame. Claire had stepped out from the leg and into the open and her face was the kind of brave that has a tremble under it that makes it generous instead of crazy. He wanted to take that tremble from her. He wanted to own the before and the after. He wanted to prove that if you capture the mouth, the rest of the body will remember its place.\n\nHe knew her voice would rise through the tower before he heard it in his ear, and he turned to meet it as a man turns to meet a lover who is leaving. She did not say his name this time. She said we and she said it as if it belonged to her as much as it had ever belonged to anyone. \u201cWe are the noise we keep,\u201d she said, into the rust and the rain and the metal with its own memory. \u201cWe are the hinge. We are the ugly note. We are the clapping wrong at the end of what was supposed to be your song. We are the pothole nobody filled and the metronome pushed off a porch and the dinner party where the story is told too soon and makes the room believe it is a room without a guest,\u201d she said, and he despised her because she made a sentence and then made it more than a sentence, she made it into a wall.\n\nKline started up the ladder because sometimes it is a policeman\u2019s job to be exactly where he ought not to be. He found the missing rung by history and not by eyes and made the wider step that would cost him in a knee later and didn\u2019t care. Rain lifted the smell of the tower\u2019s old paint into his nose and made him young again and more tired than he had been at nineteen. He went slow because the tower did not belong to him and because the man above him had patience and men with patience can turn speed into a liability.\n\nLeah had brought her class to her living room because the school had been released early and because parents had looked at her in the parking lot with the same naked question: what now. They clapped wrong at the television when the weather man pointed at the county and said words that had been emptied by use and filled by need. They clapped wrong at the cat and the cat tolerated it with the resignation of saints. They clapped wrong at the phone when it buzzed and ignored it when it would not stop, and then Leah picked it up and said, \u201cWe,\u201d and the line went dead as if a wire somewhere had been cut by a thought.\n\nHe adjusted the angle of the array on the catwalk because a man who has found his enemy will always blame angle for why the enemy still breathes. He did not look down. He did not look up. He looked at the part of the town that resisted him and hated it and loved it in the way a man hates and loves the brother he cannot stop measuring himself against. He told himself that what he was doing would be remembered as a kind of art with a mean mouth because art with a mean mouth is the only kind the world respects without permission. The tower treated his sound like a rumor and passed it on badly, and every time it did he ratcheted the bag a fraction, the delicate, obsessive adjustments of a man who has never had a hobby that didn\u2019t draw blood.\n\nClaire looped the chain through the ladders\u2019 lowest rung and made it kiss the metal leg in a way that would produce a small stubborn disharmonic every time the wind decided to speak. It was petty and it was effective. She tied the clothesline to the chain and made a web that would carry her insult higher, patient as laundry. She tapped the pot lid with the back of a spoon the way she had once demanded a dinner she did not want in order to make her mother laugh, and the tower learned to hate tin where before it had been indifferent. She did every wrong thing she could as beautifully as she could manage and then uglier, because ugly is stronger if you treat it right.\n\nThe rain came harder. It made the catwalk into a proof, a thing that says this is true of all catwalks, and the man took careful steps in his soaked boots because he was not a fool; he was only foolish in his devotion to an idea that made other people\u2019s lungs his business. Kline reached the curve and saw the bag and felt the way his heart tried to match its pulse to the hum it was making and refused. He went to his knees because he was tired of ruining pants being the difference between a man living and a man not, and he put his hand on the wet tape because touching is a friend of victory in a way distance never will be. He did not yet pull because men who pull without knowing what is on the other end sometimes destroy a thing they can\u2019t make again. He spoke to the bag as if it had registers that needed polite greeting. \u201cYou had a day,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are done now.\u201d\n\nAl turned and saw him and the look they exchanged was one of those long arguments men have at stoplights with their chins. There was no bravado left in either of them, just work and a little disgust at the way their bodies had made them into the men they were. He lifted the camera because muscle memory is faster than hate and quicker than law. He aimed not at Claire and not at Kline but at the ladder itself, and he clicked, and the square came out and he held it between finger and thumb and the rain doilied its surface in wavering white. He watched as if the face of an answer might lift up out of the milk and tell him who he was and what he should do next and it did not, it showed him the rungs of a ladder and the shape a man\u2019s spaces between will make if you draw them.\n\nLightning hit a mile away and the thunder made the city shiver and the array tried to take the thunder into its mouth and failed because thunder is a god with its own doctrine. The bag hummed and said, in its way, I have done my part. Kline made his choice and tore with his hands and with his heart and the tape gave like a conception and the bag shifted and the conduit bit the catwalk rail and prayed to stay and then did not and slid and struck his shin and made him say a word you only say to a man you love or a machine that has almost taken your hand. The bag swung and hit the angle iron and bounced and then was less sure of its position in this world and then it fell and the sound it made on the way down was one long embarrassed vowels you could have translated if you had been inclined to be generous.\n\nIt hit the ground and died like a toy beyond repair. The tower shuddered in relief the way a body does eventually when you stop pressing a bruise. The air remembered it could be air again and not instruction, and it stood up straighter and then it slumped because storms take their tithe. The rain exaggerated and then gave back the exaggeration with interest. One of the band kids, miles away, felt suddenly better and did not know why and put it down to finishing a scale without missing the note he always missed.\n\nAl stared at the space where his bag had been like a man looking at the plot of ground where he had planned to build a thing that would impress himself. He did not roar. He did not even close his fist. He recalculated with a speed that should have impressed anyone paying attention. He stepped toward Kline in a way that was neither threatening nor friendly but looked like the footnote to those words and Kline met him with the open hand that said later, I had no choice but that lie is always available. They balanced on a catwalk that had opinions about weight and the rain wrote a long sentence on their shoulders the way rain will when it has been asked to be theater and has agreed reluctantly.\n\nClaire stood below in her ugly shoes and had the thought you have to inventory before you can hate it properly: if he falls he will crush me and he will break me and if he does the town will remember me kindly and that is not how I want to be remembered. She stepped out of the way of that thought and put her body under a different idea. She stepped toward the ladder as if encouraging it to be the center of all things and she spoke, not to the men, but to the metal. She said, \u201cHold,\u201d and the tower, which did not care about English or the way it makes promises, did anyway.\n\nHe lifted the camera again not to shoot but because he did not know what else to do with that hand. He had spent years making it a friend and now the friend could not help him. He looked down at the square in his other palm and the rain had obliterated its argument. It was a blank with a memory of having once considered an image. It looked like a thought that had been interrupted in the doorway and had been too shy to come in. He held it like a dead moth.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to finish,\u201d Claire shouted up, and it was not a trick sentence. It was a mercy she wasn\u2019t sure she had a right to offer. \u201cYou can leave the lip open. You can refuse the circle. You can let us be ugly and you can say you had enough of clean. You can be the man who stops a sentence because he has remembered that the period is not a mercy if what it ends is still breathing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to be my we,\u201d he said, and his voice came down the tower as a flattened thing, but she understood it anyway and flinched as a person does when a word hits a bruise from a previous word. He took a step back on the catwalk because he wanted to see her face and he wanted to make sure his foot knew the pattern of the metal for next time and he wanted to be a person making choices and not a person being taught and that was when the ladder shook in a way that belonged to old hardware and not to men.\n\nKline reached without thinking and had a hand on the man\u2019s sleeve and the geometry of it was bad. Weight shifted toward a number no one had planned on. The catwalk wanted to let go of something and couldn\u2019t decide whether it would be its bolt or his wrist or the rain that made it sick. They hung like a question mark carved out of meat and intention. Claire felt their gravity reach through her shoes and into the ground and she wanted to scream but screaming is a frequency easy to count and she had taught her mouth to hate being counted in this last week and so she laughed, ugly and unmusical and wrong, a scrape you would not record and play for friends later, and the sound was so poor the tower did not know where to put it and chose to put it down. The catwalk remembered that it was metal and therefore obedient under certain circumstances and one of those circumstances had arrived and passed. It held.\n\nThey stood, the three of them, separated by ladder and rain, bound by the physics of a town that had decided to be alive. None of it was beautiful and all of it was true. He looked down at his hand, the one Kline had had to touch in order to keep him on the right side of the vocabulary of death, and he did not pull away. He did not reach back. He held still in the way that says I will make a choice later when you are not watching and let us both pretend. Kline, who had been a man long enough to understand the value of pretending, did not force the moment to declare itself. He took his hand back and let it hang by his side and the feeling in it was a throb he would not admit to anyone.\n\nThe rain thinned like a promise. The clouds ran out of speeches. The tower smelled like something you would keep in a garage and apologize to. He lifted the camera to his face at last and then did a radical thing for him: he lowered it without taking a picture. He slid it into the pillowcase and tied the knot with a tenderness that implied marriage and death. He walked the catwalk to the ladder without haste and when his boot hit the rung that wasn\u2019t there he made the wide step like a man born in this town and then he made the rest of the descent a sentence with commas, steady and annoying. He stepped onto the ground and the ground accepted him because ground does not have a politics beyond gravity.\n\nPeople had come without organizing themselves and they left without applauding. Mrs. Landrum\u2019s dog had decided to be brave and had peed on Kline\u2019s tire in an act of solidarity that the dog could not explain and none of them wanted to interrogate. A boy on a bike had watched from the next street and would tell the story later in a way that made him the hinge and nobody would begrudge him that because being a hinge is a kind of work. Leah walked up with a child on each hand and a third clinging to her sleeve and she nodded at Claire in a way that said she was paying with interest on a debt that was good to owe.\n\nHe did not run and he did not submit. He walked into a ditch like a man who believes ditches were made by men exactly like him and therefore are owed to him. He moved along the edges the way he always had. The town did not follow him because it had learned that following is a music and he loves music too much. They watched him lessen and they did not make a plan because they were plan-tired, all of them. Kline let him go because sometimes what you let do not tells everyone else it can be done and this was not that day. He did something instead that felt exactly like his father unlocking the hardware store in the morning and flipping the sign and sweeping the front walk\u2014the ritual that says we exist again after a night. He turned to Claire and said, \u201cWe put a man at the shed,\u201d and she nodded, \u201cand a woman,\u201d she added, and he pretended he had said that part first.\n\nEvening came with a sweetness that felt undeserved and they took it because taking good things without argument is the reward for the rare correct day. Harv nailed a piece of tin to the back of his studio door with a single nail at the top so that it would sigh when someone entered. The doughnut shop ran out of coffee and refused to brew more because the owner had learned that scarcity makes a room quiet and he was opposed to it. The old man with the harmonica took it out on his porch and played nothing in particular and people walking by felt their bodies make adjustments they would not name.\n\nIn the shed, which had been visited by men with gloves and a woman with a camera who made photographs that did not stay in their squares but roamed, the line of Polaroids shivered on its string and then held still, as if to acknowledge that there are rooms where likeness has to wait for meaning. One clothespin sprang and did not break and a photograph slid an inch and settled. It was the one of the church lipstick, the crooked red, the human effort visible where it usually attempts to hide. Claire stood in the doorway with the state man and with Kline and with Leah, who had come because she had supervised enough art projects to have earned the right to stand in rooms where images get made. They looked at the mouths and did not say the word mouth. They listened to the rain finish making its point on the tin roof. They began, without telling each other, to think about the day after this one, and the day after that, and they did not yet call it hope because hope is a clean word and the day was not clean. They called it clear, and that was a word the town had always been able to love.\n\nHe slept and did not. He lay on his cot and listened to the insects call to one another in a language he did not make and could not control, and it made him incandescent with a grief he would never permit himself to name. He dreamed that he had closed the circle and the town had obeyed and he had walked through it like a preacher through a murmur and then something had happened to the quiet, it had failed to be his friend, it had become merely an absence and not an instrument, and he had woken with the word unfinished in his mouth and the taste of tin in his teeth. He swore to the ceiling the way a man swears at a horse that spooks at a shadow he cannot see, and the ceiling had learned to ignore him.\n\nMorning took up its chores. The sky did not apologize. Children ate cereal with small percussions in bowls. The train made its promises to the crossings and kept them. The water tower, clean and factual, held its body.\n\nAnd in the alley where the town\u2019s new words had appeared on brick, another hand had added a line, thinner than the rest and careful in a way that made you want to scold it and hug it both. WE ARE THE NOISE WE KEEP, it said, and beneath, AND THE QUIET WE CHOOSE, and under that, smaller still, NOT THE QUIET WE ARE MADE. People passing nodded as if the brick had spoken a greeting and they were too well mannered to leave it unanswered. A woman stopped and ran her finger over the chalked letters and found, to her surprise, that they did not come off on her skin. The rain had set them. The town had decided to keep this one. It would not be wiped away with the week.\n\nKline brought to Claire a sandwich he had not made and did not claim had been made for her. He set it on her porch and sat and admitted by the position of his hands that he had used them today for things that did not require force and had been grateful. They did not talk about plans because plans had been their diet and they wanted fruit. They spoke of Leah\u2019s student who had demanded to be allowed to write a report on the physics of wrong clapping, of the boy from the fence who had asked if he could keep the rope that had burned him because he did not want it to burn anybody else and then had accepted a compromise and kept a length of clothesline instead, of Harv\u2019s wife who had told Harv to stop granting evil so much craft and to come to bed.\n\n\u201cHe isn\u2019t finished,\u201d Kline said finally, not to bring the air down so much as to keep it from getting above itself.\n\n\u201cHe thinks finishing is owning,\u201d Claire said. \u201cHe thinks the circle is a deed. But there are mouths that never close. There are mouths you can\u2019t finish. There are stories that refuse to end even when the last sentence looks like a period. He hasn\u2019t met those yet and I don\u2019t know if we are the people to introduce him or if he will find them anyway.\u201d\n\nKline stretched his legs and his old knee spoke in a language he would be fluent in soon whether he liked it or not. \u201cWe got time,\u201d he said, and the word we did not feel like theft when he said it. It felt like a hand on a porch rail and a dog asleep in the daytime and a woman stringing clothespins on a line. It felt like a sound that did not need to apologize for itself or explain how it learned to be ugly.\n\nHe stood and picked up the paper from her porch and put it under the leg of her table out of habit because that is what you do when you see a wobble and you can fix it without a committee. The table steadied as if to say, this is all the engineering I require. He tipped his hat which he did not wear except when the world asked him to act the part of the man his daddy had taught him to admire. He said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be stupid again tomorrow if we have to,\u201d and she said, \u201cI\u2019m counting on it,\u201d and they left the porch having believed each other.\n\nAt the edge of town, where the ditch elected to be a creek again and the trees made a vote for shade, a man taller than sense paused to look at water that would never be his. He put his hand out and felt the air on his palm the way boys hold their hand to a wind out a car window and teach themselves what a wing is. He said a word that might have been we and might have been no and then he left the word behind on the lip of the bank like a coin balanced on the edge of flipping, and the creek, tactful and ruthless, took it and turned it over twice and did not report the answer. The day had work left. The noise was in the keeping. The quiet would be chosen or it would not. The town continued. The map wrinkled. The circle waited, open like a surprise that might be mercy and might be simply unclosed.",

                              "content": "The night carried a hush so low it seemed the pines themselves were listening. A thousand needles leaned in, and the frogs along the ditch went still in a single inhalation of fear or awe. Under a bruised moon, an enormous man waded through waist-high grass as if he were crossing a dream, heavy and slow and sure. The boy behind the hurricane fence had climbed a stack of cinderblocks to see what made the ground thud like a heartbeat, and he kept his breath shallow the way his grandmother had taught him when the hounds ran close. Be quiet, the boy thought. Be a leaf. Be a knot in wood.\n\nSomething moved beyond the field\u2019s edge\u2014the silhouette of a billboard for cigarettes long discontinued, a metal mouth rusted into a grin. And then the figure was there under it, a piece cut out of the night. Big, the boy\u2019s mind whispered. Big is not the word. The air thinned around him, shrank away. There was a halo of fireflies hanging in astonishment, and when they scattered the boy could see hands like slabs of stone and a face most shadow, least expression, until it turned. The giant looked toward the fence as though he had been listening to the boy think. The boy\u2019s heart went sideways. A rabbit darted and tripped the wire, and the fence gave a small voice, a little zing\u2014the kind of sound you\u2019d only hear if you were waiting for it.\n\nBetween the giant\u2019s fingers, something flashed. A camera, square and old. A click like a lid closing, and another; a tiny throat of light from the body of the machine. Even at the distance, the boy knew it was an instant. Someone his age had shaken a picture like that before, held it at the edge as a face surfaced from gray. This one would not hold a face. It would hold a mouth. The boy had read about it the way you read about storms that happen in other states, sure of your safety until you are not.\n\nThe giant placed the photograph on the small of the billboard\u2019s metal leg and walked on. He had a patient stride, a metronome steady, and with each step the ground admitted he was there. The boy did not move. He wanted to call out to anyone, everyone, to the frogs even, to say he had seen the shadow in the field, the man like a moving obelisk, but the sound died in his throat as if his voice understood what his body did not: that sound would be noticed, weighed, measured, judged. The giant passed into the curtain of trees without breaking a branch.\n\nLater, the boy would climb down, circle out brave, his hands prickling with nettled leaves. He would stand before the photograph under the billboard. He would see a mouth, soft and close, the lips pressed together as if to keep in a secret. The mouth was not smiling. The mouth was alone. He would not touch the little square. He would run and run and tell, words jamming against his teeth like fish wanting back to water. He would be believed, and he would not. In a town where belief and disbelief braided like river strands, both true and untrue at once.\n\nAt a lit table in Atlanta two days later, Doctor Winston smiled for the camera with a practiced heart. The museum had copper sconces and a grant, a leather smell of old money and newer books. She was reading from her latest, The Speaking Earth: Folklore and the Language We Live In, answering questions about accents and how words come to us like inheritable hair. Someone asked about silence, and she answered the way you answer when you\u2019ve written twelve chapters and still feel you know almost nothing. \u201cSilence,\u201d she said, \u201cisn\u2019t empty. It\u2019s as full as a concealed river. In the South, we\u2019ve made furniture out of it. We lean on it. We think it\u2019s part of the house, but it\u2019s a guest, and it has its own mind.\u201d\n\nAfter, people lined up. A woman with a magnolia pinned in her hair said her grandmother used to salt words, let them cure. An undergrad asked for a selfie, then changed her mind, then changed it back, the way fish do with light. Claire Winston\u2014she was Claire to herself and Doctor to others; make of that what you will\u2014signed her name the way her mother had taught her, with a second flourish to make it look like a thought trailing off rather than a goodbye. That was when the text came in, a number she didn\u2019t recognize, Meridian area code.\n\nYou need to come home. The words were not theirs. They didn\u2019t apologize for the hour. They didn\u2019t say please.\n\nShe found a corner and called back. The man who picked up had a voice like a boot in gravel. \u201cDoctor Winston,\u201d he said, as though he had practiced to sound like someone from television. \u201cThis is Sheriff Kline. I don\u2019t suppose you remember me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember your father\u2019s hardware store,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember the bucket of nails by the register.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s him,\u201d Kline said, with a laugh that broke in the middle. \u201cFive-gallon bucket. Ten different gauge. One scoop and you\u2019d get a surprise.\u201d He cleared his throat. Milked the pause. \u201cWe got something we need you to look at.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a detective,\u201d she said. The standard defense. Old habit.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t say you were. You know how stories plant their feet. We had a\u2014something left at the edge of a field. Boy saw it, told his folks, they called us. It\u2019s a picture.\u201d He was quiet a moment, the air on the line stretching thin. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t want to say this while you\u2019re not here. There\u2019s a way folks tell things when they\u2019ve seen, and a way when they haven\u2019t. You come see. Please.\u201d\n\nThe please had arrived. It was new. She lingered with the phone against her ear after he hung up, the dead line warm on her skin. She looked out the foyer windows at the museum\u2019s pond, a flat coin of water surrounded by ornamental grasses. A couple stood near the bench with a paper bag of pastries. They leaned toward each other; their mouths made a small oval of laughter. The parts of us that invented language were, she\u2019d always believed, born from the desire to move thought across a gap and into a listening ear. The anatomy of that wish was a mouth, a hand, an ear, a shared look, and\u2014beneath\u2014the ache to be known. She held her own mouth shut till she tasted copper at the seam and didn\u2019t know whether the taste was memory, fear, or the ends of words burning through.\n\nShe drove back the next morning, four hours of road that fell away in a gray ribbon, truncated by storm and summer. Eighteen waking hearts of her life had been spent leaving Meridian, and nineteen returning; her father used to say that was the math of being born where people think the trees themselves tell tales. \u201cThey do,\u201d she\u2019d say, and he\u2019d laugh and say, \u201cSee, you already proved me wrong.\u201d\n\nBy late afternoon, she was in a town that had never decided whether it was awake or half-asleep. The murals on empty storefronts were new, the three-footed Art Deco building was old, the doughnut shop was the same because it would be the last thing to die. Sheriff Kline\u2019s office still had the framed aerial map with a crack through the glass over Bonita Lakes, as if a miniature earthquake had been contained in the frame. He was thinner than she remembered and looked like he\u2019d spent his youth chewing bark. He shook her hand with both of his, an old habit powered by simple manners or fear, she couldn\u2019t tell.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t bring it here,\u201d he said. \u201cDidn\u2019t want to bring it through town any more than we had to. Thought you\u2019d better see it in place.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think the place matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a feeling about that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think you do too, if your book is to be believed.\u201d\n\n\u201cBooks are true and untrue at once,\u201d she said.\n\nHe grabbed his hat. \u201cYou notice how folks always quote your writing to you right before asking you to do something you don\u2019t want to do?\u201d\n\nShe thought of all the times her own words had walked in ahead of her like children tugging at a stranger\u2019s sleeve. She followed him anyway.\n\nAt the field, the grass had a habit of shining even in shadow. The chain-link fence held a scrap of shirt where someone had climbed too fast. The billboard hunched over the ditch, advertising nothing to no one, the aluminum peeling like fish scales. Sheriff Kline led her to a leg of the signpost. There, taped with clear packing tape, was a Polaroid as crisp as a seen thing. A mouth. Lips relaxed, closed. The upper lip was slightly fuller, and if she had to say anything about it she would have said the person\u2019s face just beyond the borders was young, and she wished she did not have to be the one to say it.\n\n\u201cPhotography like that,\u201d Kline said, using the word like that as if it were a species. \u201cWe got three in two months. One in Vancleave. One down near De Kalb. All at edges\u2014roads that turn into dirt, you know the type. Always high enough to be deliberate. Always sealed. No prints we could pull. No nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the child?\u201d She kept her voice in that narrow place between clinical and kind, a tightrope only a certain number of sentences could walk.\n\n\u201cMissing since yesterday. Eleven. His mama hasn\u2019t stopped breathing in, if you know what I mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said, and she did. She had been in rooms where the air had a shape made by grief and no one wanted to step through it for fear of breaking it, a glass bowl full of bees.\n\nShe didn\u2019t touch the picture. She bent closer, reading the edges the way she\u2019d learned to read stories. The white border had a thumb-smudge. The emulsion had a smart little leap in its surface, as if a bubble had tried to rise when it was drying. Tiny as a freckle of rain on a hot car top. \u201cOld film,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou can tell.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey stopped making this stock years back. People still buy old packs. Sometimes they store them wrong. The colors go funny. This one didn\u2019t. Whoever\u2019s doing this knows something about temperature and patience.\u201d\n\n\u201cTemperature and patience,\u201d Kline said, tasting it for clues. \u201cSounds like cooking or killing.\u201d\n\nShe looked at him and didn\u2019t say anything. The words hung there anyway.\n\nThey walked the field\u2019s perimeter. There wasn\u2019t much to see. There never is, when someone wants there not to be. At the fence line, a boy in a Braves T-shirt stood with his mother, who kept a hand on his shoulder like she meant to hold him there till college. The boy looked at Claire with solemn concentration. He had seen something and put his eyes around it to try to make it smaller. She nodded to him, and he nodded back like a little governor.\n\nOn the way back, Kline said, \u201cYou grew up with Pastor Pruitt\u2019s lot, didn\u2019t you? You know his daughter. She teaches third grade now, over at King Road.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeah,\u201d she said. \u201cWe ate our first peaches together. We built a raft that sank in ten seconds. We thought that was a triumph.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s one of the ones who called about the last photograph. She\u2019s been organizing the parents, keeping the kids off the trails after school. She\u2019ll want to talk to you. She thinks you might have a way of telling the town what this is so we can have a way of putting our hands around it. You know how to do that, they say.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know how to take a story apart and put it back together,\u201d Claire said. \u201cThat is not the same thing as catching a man.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe it is if the man is made of story,\u201d Kline said, surprising her, then shrugging, embarrassed by his own reach.\n\nHe left her at the courthouse steps with the promise of dinner in paper bags later. She walked to the square where the bankers took their lunches and the pigeons wore their suits. She thought about mouths. Her mind had always turned to anatomy when frightened, the way a heart returns to rhythm after a startle by enumerating its parts. Lips, labial, labrum: the rim of a barrel, the edge of speech. The mouth was the border between the inside and the weather. On the way back to her car, she passed the window of the photography studio that had been there since the seventies. The man who ran it now kept his father\u2019s sign and his father\u2019s ways. He was in the back, repairing something with an eyeglass magnifier. He looked up and raised a hand. She walked in without quite deciding.\n\n\u201cDoctor Winston,\u201d he said, knowing her the way towns do, by accumulation. \u201cI read that one you wrote about train whistles once. That bit about the music nobody asked for.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarv,\u201d she said. \u201cYou still keep old film in a cooler?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do. I told my wife, if the house burns, I\u2019m taking the cooler out first.\u201d He smiled, then read her. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many people around here would know how to keep vintage Polaroid stock alive through a summer?\u201d\n\n\u201cHalf the teens online think they do,\u201d Harv said, \u201cbut they don\u2019t. They like the mistakes. They like the streaks and misfires. The kind of picture you\u2019re thinking of, somebody\u2019s determined. They\u2019re in love with the clean miracle of it. I sell to a club of men who meet once a month to talk about the good old days. Couple new kids. A teacher from the community college. That kid from the newspaper. And\u2014\u201d He paused, let the thought rest in his mouth like a seed he could either spit out or swallow. \u201cWe had a fellow come through with hands like they were built to hold lumber. Not from here. Asked questions. Didn\u2019t buy anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cA week. Maybe two.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wanted to know what to do if the film made the colors wrong. Asked if a cooler would keep it right. He had this way of hunching when he spoke. Like he had to make himself smaller to fit in the room.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he give a name?\u201d Her voice made the question a feather, as if it could slip past him and collect dust without stirring.\n\n\u201cAl. Said friends called him Al. That\u2019s nothing. Everyone\u2019s called Al if you look at them right.\u201d\n\n\u201cTall,\u201d she said, because saying giant in Harv\u2019s tidy shop felt like exposing something indecent. \u201cBig.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a church,\u201d Harv said quietly. \u201cHe made my ceiling look lower than it is. Even when he sat.\u201d He pointed with his chin toward the door as if the man\u2019s height might have bent the doorframe\u2019s memory. \u201cHe stared at my mouth when I spoke. You ever have that happen? People look at eyes, or they look away. He watched my mouth. I didn\u2019t know what to do with my tongue.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he buy anything,\u201d she said, knowing he hadn\u2019t.\n\nHarv\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201cHe took a picture on his way out. Asked if he could test the shutter on an old Land Camera I hadn\u2019t priced yet, lifted it without meaning to ask, like it belonged to him. It had film in it. He shot it not at anything. Just lifted it and clicked like a reflection was enough. Handed it back and left. I didn\u2019t notice till after that it was a picture of\u2014\u201d He stopped.\n\n\u201cOf what,\u201d she said.\n\nHe went to the back, touched a drawer he didn\u2019t want to open, opened it. He came out with a square in his palm. He showed it to her like he was showing her a bruise. Her mouth. The picture was of his wife\u2019s mouth in a frame on the counter. Harv had forgotten the frame was there\u2014a wedding picture. Lips made soft by the memory of a vow. The square captured only the lips, and the bit of chin, nothing else alive or showing. He had placed the photograph face-down in the drawer.\n\nShe swallowed. \u201cYou kept it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt felt like evidence,\u201d Harv said, ashamed of the word. \u201cI couldn\u2019t throw it away the same way I can\u2019t throw away the last button from a shirt if I know the shirt got lost and not worn out. It\u2019s wrong, but it\u2019s mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me take it,\u201d she said. \u201cLet me give it to Kline.\u201d\n\nHe hesitated, then handed it to her with a slight bow as if she were the kind of person who took such offerings away, cleaned them, absolved them. She slipped the photograph into the inside pocket of her jacket. It lay against her chest, cool against her shirt, as if it had a temperature all its own.\n\nOn her porch, later, Meridian dusk made everything louder: the insects, a train throat-clearing three blocks away, the tinny voice of a baseball game from her neighbor\u2019s stoop. Leah walked up the steps with the old familiarity of a girl used to walking in uninvited. She had the same braid she\u2019d had in sixth grade, just made wiser. She hugged and let go at just the right time. They sat.\n\n\u201cYou remember how you used to tell stories until my father said if you didn\u2019t finish before the biscuits were ready he\u2019d have to throw a towel over your head,\u201d Leah said.\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t know what that meant,\u201d Claire said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d have done it,\u201d Leah said fondly. \u201cWe need your stories. Not the old ones. The new ones that tell the old ones. Something\u2019s happening and we\u2019re making rules with our mouths because we don\u2019t know what else to do. We\u2019ll sing in the school gym so loud he can\u2019t hear us, someone said. And I said, he doesn\u2019t want to hear us. That\u2019s the point.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mouth as a door,\u201d Claire said. \u201cPeople always think closing it keeps them in. Sometimes it just makes it easier for the wrong person to press a finger to the latch.\u201d\n\nLeah\u2019s hand drifted to her own lips. \u201cI keep telling the kids their voices are good. That their names are a form of armor. You think that matters?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt matters,\u201d Claire said. \u201cBut armor can also make a target.\u201d\n\nLeah looked out at the oak across the street, its branches thrown wide like a question. \u201cSheriff Kline says this man\u2019s got a plan. Says he\u2019s not just wandering. Someone who walks like that,\u201d she said, meaning the rumor that had reached the town before the formal words did\u2014someone whose steps made windows remember. \u201cWhat would he want.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be heard in a way that makes silence,\u201d Claire said. \u201cThe maxim is old. Air loves equal pressure. Sound hates it. If you make enough of one, you erase the other.\u201d\n\nLeah chewed that. \u201cHe called me,\u201d she said suddenly, shocking herself. \u201cBefore the second picture. He didn\u2019t say anything. He breathed. I knew it was him. How do we know things like that, Claire? He breathed and my heart counted every breath like it could make him stop if it kept up.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou tell Kline that.\u201d Claire heard the sharper note in her own voice. \u201cYou don\u2019t keep that. You give it over.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make it real,\u201d Leah said, small. \u201cBut it\u2019s already real. I\u2019ll tell.\u201d\n\nClaire walked the blocks of her childhood that night the way one revisits a dream to look for something missed. The mills were quiet. The dome of the courthouse sighed itself into the sky. She passed the playground where she had once fallen and cut her lip on the corner of the slide. Her mother had bent to her, put her own mouth over the cut as if she could pull the pain out through the skin. The memory lit with a fidelity she hadn\u2019t asked for. It made her stop on an empty sidewalk and hold her mouth together like two pieces of a broken plate.\n\nHe was a half-mile away, stepping through the swamp\u2019s lip of cattails, moving without hurry toward the truss bridge that cut the river like a scar. Alessandro. He had been given that name in the first fever of his parents\u2019 hope, and in time he had pruned it down to Al to fit in the places where the ceiling was low. He was not from Meridian, but he was from its cousin, and a cousin will recognize a cousin even when they\u2019ve tried to change their hair and their state lines. He measured distance by what he could cross in an hour and measured people by how loud he imagined their ancestors stood under the sun and shouted. He had learned hate the way some men learn carpentry: you can build a chair, you can build a gallows, the hands don\u2019t pause to ask which.\n\nThe first time he had taken a picture of lips, it had been an accident, and it had felt, for one terrible clean instant, like invention. A woman at the bus station had laughed at someone behind him. He had turned and hit the shutter without knowing why. When the developing finished and the picture made a square world, those lips emerged like an animal in its winter den. It had felt like catching his own breath in his fist. He didn\u2019t think in words often\u2014they scuffed his brain like grit in gear grease\u2014but he thought in shapes, in the geometry of openings. A mouth was an opening. A mouth made sound, and sound had made him run from rooms as a child, belly burning. He had learned to make quiet with his hands. Now he made quiet by collecting the shapes that made noise. In the shed in the disused lot where he slept, there were sheets of photographs clothes-pinned in a neat, precise line. They were his hymnals. He did not read music. He understood arrangement.\n\nHe remembered the store man and the way the store man\u2019s mouth had made nervous ovals and moved like a small fish in a jar. He had loved the way the man stopped moving his tongue as if the tongue belonged to him and the man was immaterial. He had managed not to laugh. Laughter was for people who had mountains left to climb. He had a plan, and a plan consumed laughter like a fire consumes oxygen. It was too soon to say, even in his own head. It was never too soon not to say it out loud. He didn\u2019t say things out loud when they mattered. His father had told him, a long time before the world learned how tall he was, that anything said out loud could be held in another man\u2019s hand. This is mine, he thought, and walked on, and listened to the bridge tremble as if it had remembered something.\n\nAt dawn, Claire sat in the library archives with a pair of white gloves making her own hands unfamiliar to her. The towns around Meridian kept their own clip files; hers were no exception. She wasn\u2019t looking for him. She was looking for the phrase he had stepped out of. Monsters don\u2019t come from air; they step out of the vocabulary we swear we don\u2019t use anymore. She found a story in a 1911 Meridian Star about a man who had walked from the lumber camps to scare the townspeople with his height; she found a photograph from 1962 showing a woman holding a sign that begged someone to listen; she found a sentence from a church bulletin that asked people to close their mouths for a day to honor the dead. She circled the sentence and copied it into her notebook without knowing why.\n\n\u201cDoctor Winston,\u201d said a voice. Leah again, holding a Styrofoam cup of coffee. \u201cYou were always a morning person,\u201d Leah said, a little accusatory, as if morning itself were an opinion. \u201cKline\u2019s asking for you for a minute.\u201d She put the cup down in a crescent of papers and winced. \u201cDon\u2019t yell at me for the ring.\u201d\n\nClaire smiled. \u201cThere are worse marks than coffee on paper.\u201d She closed the file gently.\n\nKline had a room in the station he\u2019d converted into an idea room. It had a whiteboard that had known better days and a bulletin board that had known bullets. Pictures were pinned in a neat spider\u2019s web. Not the Polaroids. He was saving those for a more sterile gaze. These were locations, dates, missing posters, a map with pushpins.\n\n\u201cHe keeps to the edges,\u201d Kline said, tapping the pins. \u201cHe puts them high, like he wants us to look up. He doesn\u2019t want us to find them by accident. He wants us to find them just slow enough that he knows where we are. You see how these lines make a thing,\u201d he said suddenly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is yet. But it\u2019s a thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a circle,\u201d Claire said. \u201cAlmost. He\u2019s tracing, with the edges. Closing it by inches. Some people think if you finish the prayer just right, it comes true. Some people think if you measure the town with your feet, you own it. I think he\u2019s measuring to make a shape he wants to fill.\u201d She didn\u2019t say the word. She didn\u2019t want it to learn she had one for it.\n\nKline rubbed the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger as if he could rub away what he had seen. \u201cWe also got this,\u201d he said then, reluctant. He had a small evidence bag. Inside, a postcard. It bore a picture of a quiet lake. On the back, in a careful hand: The world is too loud. He had written it in a neat schoolboy script that made Claire\u2019s skin rise. She felt her mouth. She didn\u2019t touch it. She could not help imagining the hand that had held the pen; something so deliberate in that body felt obscene.\n\n\u201cHandwriting analysis,\u201d he said. He had already sent it.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t get him with that,\u201d she said, and it sounded cruel, and she was sorry, and she was not. \u201cHe\u2019s not someone who thinks he has to write to be known. He thinks he can push noise out of a room by walking through it. He will want us to come to him the way a song comes to a chorus. He already knows where we stand.\u201d\n\nShe went home on foot, because the air was the kind that could not move faster than a walk and be believed. A card was tucked in her doorjamb on the outside. It had no stamp. Inside, someone had drawn a mouth with a child\u2019s red pencil\u2014the roughest curve of lips, almost comic. The words below were blocky, almost gentle, almost apology, almost prayer. Your words make more mouths. She put the card on the kitchen table, and her elbows on either side of it, and rested her forehead against her knuckles. He had walked up to her house like it was an errand. He had stood under her soffit where the wasps were trying to decide if the season had ended. He had looked at her door and decided she was not home. He had not guessed her car. He had not guessed her habit of walking. He had not looked up at the kitchen window and seen her face. He had looked only at the seam, at where one thing became another. She understood something then about him that she hadn\u2019t before: he saw the world as a series of edges. He misunderstood that the center was where light collected best.\n\nShe held the card a long while and then gave it to Kline and watched his face change the way faces do when what is private becomes a civic matter. He cursed, very soft. He said, \u201cHe can\u2019t be let to decide what our words are.\u201d\n\nAt night, when the sound of her neighbor\u2019s game ebbed, when the tree frogs took the air back for their own, when the train cut through the belly of the town and made its long throat-clearing more announcement than apology, Claire lay awake on her back like a patient under old lights. She thought of the boy at the fence. She thought of her own mother, who had once told her there was no such thing as a man taller than a story. She thought of how wrong and how right that was. She pictured a man walking into a room where children were singing and raising his hands not in blessing but in calculation. She pictured him laying out his photographs like an atlas. She pictured silence rolling across a floor like a tide. She turned on her side and pressed her lips together, and listened to her own breath as if it were someone else\u2019s and she could learn how to stop it or encourage it as needed.\n\nBy morning, a rumor had raced around town that he had been seen near the rail yards, stepping along the center line of the tracks like a balance beam that only he could carry. Claire went there with her notebook, because she could not not go. The yards had the smell of iron and rain. A cat watched from a pile of pine. A man in a yellow vest told her she couldn\u2019t be there and then, when he recognized her from a picture in the paper from five years back, told her she could as long as she didn\u2019t get herself killed. \u201cThat\u2019s the rule,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cStands for everybody.\u201d\n\nShe walked along the far fence, felt the shiver of something larger. Not an engine. Something else. The sound of walking, but slower, clockwork. She looked up. The trestle cut the sky into squares. On it, for an instant, a figure. He paused, one foot ahead, a stillness like a held note. Her jaw went cold. She knew the measure of him before her eyes had the detail; the way the world under him reacted told her what her eyes needed to know. He looked down. He could not possibly have seen her face at that distance. He saw the way a mouth moves even from far away.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d he said.\n\nShe did not know that she had said anything, but something in her must have formed. The word left her without her consent. \u201cAlessandro.\u201d It was what was on his birth certificate, and if she could build a bridge to him it would be built out of the first name someone once chose with care, not the one he had chosen for himself when he decided to hide. She hated herself for it. She clutched it like a tool and prayed it was not also a gift.\n\nHe tilted his head as if he had heard a chord resolve. \u201cThat\u2019s not what anyone here calls me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour father did,\u201d she said, because she had read the census with its household names and because it sounded possible. The truth did not matter as much as the shape of the truth; it was a key; the door would either fit it or not.\n\nHe smiled, and it was terrible. Not because he bared his teeth. He didn\u2019t. He did not show his mouth at all. The smile was in the way his cheekbones made the air step back. He lifted his hand and made a small square between his fingers, and she felt her lips wanting to perform for him, to make the shape he could capture. She held them still. It was a muscle more than an impulse. She made herself plain.\n\n\u201cYou should go home,\u201d he said conversationally, like a man leaning at an outdoor table in good weather. \u201cYou should write your book.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am home,\u201d she said, and he considered that as if it were a variation on a theme he hadn\u2019t expected. Then he moved on, the trestle murmuring under him. He walked out of her frame. It was as if a ceiling had fallen and then been caught again without a sound breaking.\n\nShe called Kline with hands that did not feel like hers. She gave him everything except the part where she had said his name like she had been given it to keep. She kept that thing and put it on the shelf where she kept the glass she had used to catch hornets with when she was ten. Useless, dangerous, a trophy. She didn\u2019t know if it would help or hurt, later, to admit that she had called him that. She only knew her mouth still felt as if it had been looked at too long.\n\nThe giant\u2019s shed was a place without clocks. Time in there was counted by how fast the chemicals breathed. He hung the latest square by a clothespin and made himself not look at it. He had learned discipline the hard way, the way you learn to carry water without spilling in a pan across a field\u2014by slopping it two dozen times and being told to lick it up. If he let his eyes move over the pictures in a certain way, he could hear a kind of music; he could hear what he thought of as relief. He would not indulge. He had a plan that was bigger than relief. He cleaned the lens. He imagined the gymnasium down by the school as a mouth. He imagined it shut.\n\nHe thought of the woman at the tracks who had called him a name he hadn\u2019t earned. He had no feeling about her beyond irritation that she had bent the air in a way he hadn\u2019t chosen. He had a few words. He kept them in his pocket like a knife. He would use them once and fold them again. He did not say them now. He slipped the small camera into a pillowcase and tied it like bread for a journey.\n\nIn the evening, Leah came to Claire\u2019s porch with the news that the PTA had moved the fall festival into the gym, that the children would sing their songs early to be home by dark. \u201cYou\u2019ll come?\u201d Leah asked, and Claire said yes because saying no would be like building a door in a house with no walls. The sky had pulled itself low and purple. Someone had already hung lights. The gym had that smell of floor wax and lemon and centuries of breath.\n\nThe children lined up, ridiculous and magnificent, and moved their mouths around words about stars and corn. Claire stood beside Kline at the back. She wanted to shield them with her hands like eggs in a carton. Kline\u2019s jaw worked. \u201cWe pulled cars round the back,\u201d he said, too casually. \u201cWe don\u2019t advertise our fear. We don\u2019t not feel it.\u201d\n\nShe nodded. She looked at the EXIT signs as if they were talismans. She counted. She made a list in her head of who she could carry if she had to. She watched the doors. She could not not imagine him. She could not not imagine the sound of his step. The giant did not come. He did not come. She did not exhale. Somewhere between verse and chorus, she felt an odd calm. It was not safety. It was the opposite. It was the knowledge that he was waiting for a note they hadn\u2019t hit yet.\n\nWhen the children finished, the room spilled its applause like a bucket and everyone\u2019s mouth opened at once and the space expanded by inches because sound makes space. Claire watched the fact of it. She pressed her lips together, then let them fall apart, then brought them together again. It felt like the oldest decision in the world. It felt like a door with a stubborn latch. She left her mouth open, halfway. A compromise with air.\n\nAt home, there was a letter under her doormat. No postcard and no drawing, just a sheet of paper torn from a lined notebook. He had written two sentences, and if letters could whisper, these did. The world is too loud, he wrote again. Tomorrow, we make it quiet. The we was large and small at once, presumptuous and inclusive. She folded the paper and cried in a way she did not like to be witnessed, soundless, the body\u2019s way of letting something pass through it like weather. Then she did what she had avoided doing since she\u2019d stepped into the field with Kline. She called her sister in Baton Rouge and told her something she had not told anyone except Leah once in an unimportant afternoon when they were seventeen. \u201cI dreamed once,\u201d she said to the phone, \u201cthat I could not speak and no one noticed. It was the best dream I ever had. And then I woke up terrified. You cannot make a life between those two things without a crack.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always did like a crack,\u201d her sister said, aiming for light and landing near.\n\n\u201cNot this one,\u201d Claire said. \u201cNot this.\u201d\n\nThe next day drew itself up hot and blinding as if the sun were overcompensating for all that hush. Claire drove past the school. The gym was locked and proud. Sheriff cars hunkered at each corner like dogs. Claire parked two streets away and walked. Her shadow could not keep up. She had the piece of paper from the doormat in her pocket like a shard of ice. She stopped to buy a bottle of water from a church youth group and a brownie wrapped in saran that stuck to itself no matter which way you peeled.\n\nAt noon, when the bell rang and the sound came like a flock of birds out of a roof, she looked up and saw the trestle, the line of sky above it, the possibility of a figure slowing there to look down and measure. She looked at the mouth of the gym, hinged and simple. She looked at the mouths of the children spilling out into a hungry day. She looked at her own reflection in the library window across the street\u2014her mouth an idea, then a fact.\n\nShe heard, once, a step. It might have been a truck hitting a pothole. It might have been the beginning of the hour. She made herself walk toward the place where the sound had pointed. She knew she could not keep this man from making his shape. She could only interrupt, interfere, speak into it, make it stutter. She could make him look at her mouth instead of anyone else\u2019s. It was a terrible thought and a good one.\n\nShe did not see him right away. He did not want to be seen, not yet. He was already in the space where he had rehearsed his silence. He had measured the doors and learned their particular songs. He had a thing in his hand that did not look like a weapon. It looked like a joke. It looked like something someone brings to a picnic to make children laugh. He would not be a man who loved laughter, but he could use its shape. He placed it on the floor near the bleachers where the air might carry a surprise faster; he stood and stepped backward, measured again, listened as the room told him the endings of himself.\n\nClaire saw him then. She did, and he saw her, and both their mouths performed the only shape available to them: the opening that is not a word. She felt the three inches between them expand to take on the mass of everyone who had ever asked her to turn a story into a rope and throw it to them. She opened her mouth and said his name. Not the one he wanted. Not the one the town had fed into the rumor mill. The old name. The first best one. Alessandro. It left her throat like a sob and a verdict at once.\n\nHe flinched in the smallest way, as if someone had dropped a note of music into a room where he had been counting in his head.\n\nBehind him, Kline came into the door like a man in a story who had decided to be late only once. He had his hands open, visible, a courtesy in a place like this. It made everything slower. It made nothing safer. The room did not know yet what it was about to hold. The sound had not made its choice. The giant was taller than the moment, taller than the town, taller than the story she had brought up from the page like a bucket from a well. He smiled without smiling. He lifted his hand. He had a teacher\u2019s patience. He would instruct the room in the art of not speaking. The children\u2019s laughter rose from somewhere like an accidental choir. Claire stepped forward. Her mouth remembered the first instrument it ever was. She drew a breath that would have to be enough. She spoke as if sound could be armor. She spoke as if stories could change the weight of a man\u2019s hand. She spoke his name again. The room turned toward her like a sunflower toward a brief, wrong sun. She spoke again, and again, and felt her own words become a wall someone else could lean against for one more unbroken second.",

His hand hovered above the thing he had set by the bleachers. It was foolish-looking the way a clown\u2019s flower is foolish until it spits acid in a joke no one wanted. A cooler, red and white, with a hinged lid and a faded sticker of a baseball team long gone to a different city. Someone had written FAMILY on the side in permanent marker as if labeling might keep a thing kind. She\u2019d seen coolers like it under tailgates and beside baptism ponds, sweating cold and condensation into gravel. There was a cord under it that winked out like the foot of a snake, and the plug found a friendly strip by the scorer\u2019s table where someone had left juice for microphones that would carry small voices into a crowded place and make them large.\n\nHe pressed the little black bud in his palm and the air pushed its shoulders up without moving. The room heard a sound that wasn\u2019t a sound; a pressure like a figured sum laid on the chest; a correction; a suggestion that the inside should meet the outside and make a treaty. The children\u2019s clapping went ragged and then stopped, like minnows ceasing at a shadow. You could feel the breath of the gym find a different direction to go. Smiles slid away not because of fear but because smiles are a kind of sound and the room had forgot the word for it. There was a half-second when the very old wood of the floor remembered riverbed; it bucked underfoot without rising.\n\nClaire did not think. Thinking belonged to rooms where the pressure was polite. She moved past Leah, who had stepped into the aisle without knowing she\u2019d done it, and reached for the fire alarm because it was near and red and everyone in the South had been taught since birth to distrust red that hangs on a wall. Her hand paused on the rectangle, the way a hunting dog pauses when told for the first time he might grab a thing and make it his. If she pulled it, she would make noise and panic. If she did not, she would help a man flatten a room. Her mouth found the sound first. \u201cClap,\u201d she said, uselessly, and then found the shape of what she meant. \u201cWrong,\u201d she said, much louder, pushing the word out like a chair into a closing door. \u201cClap wrong. Stomp wrong. Off the beat, baby. Don\u2019t count. Make a mess.\u201d\n\nLeah understood quicker than Kline did. She leapt to the edge of the lowest bleacher and windmilled her arms the way a choir director does when the choir has decided to be heaven without instruction. \u201cYou heard her,\u201d she said, and the children looked at her because they were always looking at an adult to see which way the day was tipping. \u201cDon\u2019t listen. Don\u2019t match. Do it all wrong. Make the loud that doesn\u2019t add up.\u201d She laughed in an ugly way on purpose, a scrape of sound you couldn\u2019t harmonize to save your life. The thing in the cooler was hungry for sameness. It synced to sameness like a parasite. It hated the slop of a barn band.\n\nThe nearest boy\u2014Braves shirt, the fence boy with the old eyes\u2014slapped his thighs deliberately out of time. He made noise like a drawer of spoons dropped on a tile floor. Someone beside him tried to copy and failed and that failure was exactly what the room wanted. The gym took a breath. The pressure met edges and broke like river on rock. Claire yanked the alarm then anyway, because she trusted herself to love contradictions, and the klaxon bellowed a dinosaur sound that made the device shrug, fail to anticipate, try to cancel a frequency and, because the horn modulated and lied about being steady, miss. The noise was unbearable in the way breath is unbearable when you\u2019ve been underwater too long; it hurt and it was the right hurt.\n\nKline went low and quick in a way that made you remember ribboned track meets and football practice in a life before paperwork. He had the face of a man who would apologize later for touching someone\u2019s property, and a foot that did not pause. He hit the cooler with a kick that he would feel in his hip at midnight. The lid sprang and then half-closed, then sprang again, and she saw inside a nest of ugly speakers bolted into the plastic with a patience that was a talent. There were weights to keep the box where you put it, small amplifier guts like a heart pulled from a chest. Kline tucked his hands under the thing like it was a pig at a roast and counted, one-two, with his mind, and pitched. A deputy who had been born to catch caught, and together they crabbed it toward the exit, every third step a stumble because the air does not like to let something go it has been shaping. When they got it into the open hallway, the difference was immediate; sound rushed back as if it had been waiting in the vending machines.\n\nAl did not move at first, and that was his mistake. He had expected panic. He had counted on panic. He had not counted on ugliness. He had not counted on a town choosing to be unmusical in public. He had never learned what to do with people who loved their mistakes like pets. There was a sliver of time when Claire could see him revise his beliefs, and in that sliver she knew him for what he was, which was not a god and not a monster but a man who had grown strong carrying an idea bigger than him and had mistaken the weight for virtue.\n\nHe lifted the camera that had slept in the pillowcase like bread, and the cloth fell away like a dropped handkerchief at a race. The thing was not old in the old way; it was an old model made to look chic again, married to a patience for batteries. He aimed without raising it to his eye, a shooter who had taught his arms to be eyes. That was when Claire made the ugliest shape she could with her mouth. She did not mean a face to frighten children; she meant a refusal. She let her lower lip hang like a broken hinge. She flapped her tongue like a child being cruel to another child. She refused to be a border. She refused to be a neat rim that held something back or let it out. She saw the flash be itself. She felt the small animal of light crawl across her teeth and away.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Leah said to him with a teacher\u2019s permanent hope that the word might still have purchase among the currently disobedient. It hit his chest and slid off. He had a second click ready in the muscles. Kline shouted and it wasn\u2019t a law word; it was a name he had found on an old booking sheet and promised himself he would use only if he had to make a man hear his mother again. \u201cAlessandro,\u201d he shouted, and it did what Claire\u2019s had done and what it would always do if someone said it right; it cut the air in the shape of the old kitchen his father had built, the one with the too-low ceiling and the flat smell of a sacrificed life.\n\nHe took a step back that wasn\u2019t a retreat. It was a measuring step, recalibrating how many strides it would take to leave and how many to stay. The room had found itself. Children were crying and laughing at once; a principal was counting heads with the speed of a casino dealer; a deputy was patting thin shoulders with too-large hands, trying to be many places. The fire alarm insisted on a lesson. The infrasound had fled into the hall with the cooler and died of cold. Claire could feel her heartbeat again up in her mouth where words live.\n\nHe could have kept on then. He could have done the worse thing. He did not. He slid the pillowcase back over the camera because he loved cleanliness; he loved clean beginnings and clean ends. He turned and walked the way a man walks when there are eyes and he won\u2019t give them a run. It made his height larger. He did not hurry. He did not touch a child. He passed a row of paper turkeys children had made from their hands, each with five painted feathers, and the thumbs were all too big because children mismeasure themselves. The cutouts fluttered with the wake of his passage and did not fall.\n\nClaire followed and did not know she had until the exit door slapped against her shoulder and made the bone smart. Outside, the air had a carnation pinned to it: crisp and showy. Sirens were trying to find the right street, always two turns slow because a town knows its own shortcuts better than a man in a car from the county. He angled not for the road, where hands and rules live, but for the strip of planted crape myrtles that led to the maintenance gate and then the back of the kitchen where the dumpsters stood pronouncing their own names. She had a foolish thought that he would not fit where he wanted to go. He did. The world had been building doors for him his whole life. He walked through another.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t chase,\u201d Kline said to her shoulder, and his breath fogged and made a temporary ghost. \u201cPlease,\u201d he added, practicing for a world where please might arrive early instead of late. Then he went after the man because telling someone not to chase and not chasing yourself is a recipe for being someone you don\u2019t like in your own head. He looked, in that small second, exactly like his father had looked in the hardware store when someone tried to walk out with a handsaw under a coat. Politeness first. Then a hand on the elbow that was firmer than instruction.\n\nClaire did not run. Her running would have been a gesture and she had run enough in her life to know when her running was a ritual. She walked into the sunlight with her mouth wasting a breath for every thought and let the important air go to the men who needed it to move their legs fast. Leah shepherded children with the pained, tender efficiency of someone who had birthed something with her voice and had to get it out of the dumbest river. The alarm cut off as if ashamed and the sudden vacancy made everything tender to touch. You could hear a shoe squeak. You could hear a child say, \u201cMy ears,\u201d like a complaint to God.\n\nHe was not there to be caught behind the kitchen. He had learned more about exits than any room could teach. The door to the supply alley was jimmied in a way that would not show unless you knew how a hinge looks when it has been asked too much. He had left nothing, which is not the same as leaving no trace. There was a small triangle of paper on the asphalt where a hand had fumbled, torn, and not known. Claire bent without meaning to and picked it up. It was the corner of a photograph, the white border cut on the diagonal, the emulsion missing the thing that would have given it intent. It was an empty mouth. It was a frame inside a frame. She held it like a tooth and wanted to spit.\n\nThe deputies fanned, radios shedding words that meant comfort to the men holding them and static to everyone else. Kline came back with his own mouth a hard line. He did not look at her because he was gathering himself into a shape he would need to be ten minutes from now. \u201cWe did a thing,\u201d he said, and it sounded more like a question than a boast. \u201cWe kept it from being the thing it wanted to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou made it messy,\u201d she said, and realized she was shaking and could not find the place where shaking began. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way some machines can\u2019t count you.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, and the nod acknowledged a debt he had no pocket for. He glanced at Leah, who gave him a teacher\u2019s report\u2014two children left early, four headaches, one nosebleed, nine who would need a snack and a nap\u2014and he looked grateful for numbers because numbers make a fence around bad. Then he pointed with his chin at the cooler. It sat in the hall like a prop that had been caught in the wrong act. \u201cWe get this to somebody who can look at it and not see a lunch,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if the state boys have a man who knows speakers from bombs.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarv will,\u201d Claire said, before she could talk herself out of dragging him deeper. \u201cHe\u2019ll know how a thing was made if it breathes electricity. He\u2019ll know which catalogs the screws came from. He\u2019ll know who likes to order in bulk and pay in cash. He\u2019ll know the smell.\u201d\n\nKline rubbed the heel of his hand along his jaw. \u201cAnd he\u2019ll be in the middle and that is where I don\u2019t want people I know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut here we are. Bring him to the station. Don\u2019t give him the box. Let him bring his magnifier to us.\u201d\n\nShe nodded and stepped out of the path of a flood of grandparents who had heard a siren and knew their grandchildren were made of breakable parts. The street outside had filled as if a parade had been promised. People looked at each other with the naked eyes of a town that had shared a scare and would share a story and would call it something with a name that could be laid on a table without embarrassing anyone. She saw a woman touch her mouth and then double that touch with the same hand as if she hadn\u2019t got enough the first time. The crape myrtles knocked their knuckles together in an indifferent breeze.\n\nBy late afternoon the gym had been surveyed into statements. The cooler had gone to a room with a locked door. Leah sat on Claire\u2019s porch in the clothes she had put on the morning of a normal day and cradled a lukewarm bottle of something fizzy she would not drink. She had the look of someone who had used all her grace and now had to borrow. \u201cThey sang like they were going to break the roof,\u201d she said, and a flush of pride made her face look ten years old. \u201cI told them I didn\u2019t care about tune and a few of them looked at me like I had given them permission to walk on the good carpet.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d Claire said. \u201cYou gave them the trick every old woman knows in her body. When the pot boils, stick your spoon in and make a mess. The mess is part of the recipe. It\u2019s not written on the card because the card was written by a woman who thought husbands didn\u2019t like to think about the kitchen being work.\u201d\n\nLeah laughed and then put the heel of her hand to her mouth to hold in the sound as if the sound were something someone might steal. \u201cHe took your picture,\u201d she said, because not saying it would not make it untrue.\n\n\u201cHe did,\u201d Claire said, and felt the cool spot on her skin where the flash had sat. \u201cHe won\u2019t get what he wanted. Not today. I gave him the wrong shape to keep.\u201d She realized with a small grief that she had spared herself and given him another woman\u2019s mouth years ago without knowing\u2014Harv\u2019s wife. The shame moved in a circle and came back to sit beside her like a cat, uncalled and unavoidable.\n\nHarv arrived at dusk with his eyeglass in his pocket and a nervous smile that skipped a gear when it changed. He looked at the cooler with a craftsman\u2019s dread the way a man looks at a cracked vase his grandmother loved. \u201cThis is fine-print evil,\u201d he said, not to be poetic and not to be heard, but because naming is a habit his father had beat into him in the shop behind the portrait studio. \u201cI can take it apart without killing whatever you need alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need the story of it,\u201d Kline said. \u201cNot the brand names. The why. How a man with patience put himself on the floor under elementary school feet.\u201d\n\nHarv had gloves and put them on without looking down. He lifted the lid like an apology and touched the wires like they were snakes he knew by family name. He talked as he looked. \u201cHe made an array. Cheap speakers in a drum will do something; this is speakers in a patience. He nested. He damped his own casing with carpet. He weighted the corners to keep specifics. He had to test this somewhere with a big room. An empty one. He had to be a janitor or a thief.\u201d He reached in and eased a screw with the tenderness of a dentist. \u201cThe sound isn\u2019t about loud. It\u2019s about under. Low enough it makes your molecules talk to each other about quitting. Any simpleton can make a bleed-your-ears box. This is a cough in the lungs of a building. You ever set a tuning fork on a tabletop and felt the wood say thank you? That\u2019s this, rude and multiplied. If I had to say, I\u2019d say he didn\u2019t buy these speakers new. He pulled them out of things. Cars. Aerobics rooms. There\u2019s adhesive here that isn\u2019t factory. There\u2019s sawdust in the grill that came from a place with old wood. He built in a shed.\u201d\n\n\u201cA disused lot,\u201d Claire said, and felt her throat click on a remembered clause. \u201cClothes-pins,\u201d she added, useless as always and sometimes necessary. \u201cHe pins his pictures the way his grandmother pinned laundry. There\u2019s a line in that house if there was a house. There\u2019s a line in the shed if it\u2019s a shed. He likes neat. He likes neat evil. He thinks neat makes it less evil and more clever.\u201d\n\nHarv found a signature in the weld in the way a coyote finds a rabbit without seeing it. He leaned. \u201cSee that ripple. Someone did this with a home kit and nerves. He didn\u2019t sleep the night he glued. He stared at the seam and decided it was good because it was small. He had to borrow a heat gun. He can\u2019t afford a shop. He has a friend or a person he hovers near and takes what he needs from without making a ripple.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe look for garages with missing things,\u201d Kline said, and a deputy wrote it down like a prayer. \u201cWe look for sheds with new locks in old walls. We look for men who get hives in crowds and hold their breath when the choir sings. We look for someone who has made himself a room he believes is the whole world.\u201d\n\nHarv nodded and then had a thought that made his mouth go small. \u201cI should tell you I have a hole in my film cooler,\u201d he said to Claire like a man arriving late and out of breath to a confession. \u201cThe kind that happens when someone reaches and doesn\u2019t lift before the ice has had time to melt. I patched it. I didn\u2019t tell my wife because she loved that ragged blue thing. But I should tell you. I thought it was nothing at the time. A drop-in. A glance. A hand that didn\u2019t take anything because hands sometimes don\u2019t. The hole was in December. He was here before he was here.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone is,\u201d Leah said, not unkindly. \u201cThat\u2019s how stories work.\u201d\n\nThe paper worked itself overnight into the shape of a lesson. The Meridian Star ran an extra that talked about quick action and public safety and brave children and didn\u2019t use the word the town was using to itself at kitchen tables where the sugar canister lived: mouth-man. The broadcast from the Jackson station did something else; it said a new word like it had been waiting to say it: quiet-bomber. People repeated it then and dragged it like a crate to other places until it left grooves. A woman in line at the Piggly Wiggly said she always knew the gym\u2019s floor was soft and this proved it. A man at the barber said a little quiet might not kill anyone, and the barber cut his ear on purpose and pretended not to, because some statements need blood on them to be whole.\n\nClaire dreamed that night the way people dream after a building has asked their bodies to listen to a frequency they were not built for. She dreamed she was teeth in a jar, dentures in her grandmother\u2019s glass on a tiled counter, and the glass was rattling with a bus passing and the bus was full of mouths going on somewhere to be arranged. She woke with her own teeth clenched so tight it took a minute to decide whether they belonged to the dream or to her. She got up and put water in the kettle and then remembered she didn\u2019t drink tea and put the water in a glass and let it sit in her mouth the way old men hold whiskey when they mean to think.\n\nA car idled outside in the way cars idle when they don\u2019t want to admit they\u2019re idling. It had patience. It had a low niece of that infrasound but not enough to be a cousin. She went to the window in her bare feet like a person in a story who has not yet learned what happens to people in stories who go to windows in their bare feet. The street had the look of three in the morning and a cat crossed it like a rumor. The idling stopped as if it had finished an argument with itself. She went to the door later and found a thing any teenager could have made if he had been bored and wicked: a piece of cardboard with a circle cut out of it, taped to a stick. You could hold it and look at someone and make their mouth be the only thing you saw. It was greasy where fingers had held it and there was a line of pencil on the circle\u2019s edge where someone had practiced making the opening smaller and larger, deciding what was the size of a person\u2019s voice exactly. She took it inside and held it to her own face and looked in a mirror because she believed in doing the thing all the way. She saw her mouth alone and felt in her chest the awful thought a person only has once: that she could be reduced and at the same time still be herself and be asked to live that way.\n\nAt first light, she walked to the swamp path because the sun coming up over a body of water will sit a woman down and make her shut up the way a schoolteacher does. There were men there already who never slept and talked with their backs. The cattails put up their brown thumbs and the lilies pretended to be placed by a hand. There were tracks that were not deer and not man, big as the map of a hand. An egret lifted and wrote its white cursive across the pond and made mercy into a thing with wings. She stood long enough to collect her weather into something carryable, and when she turned to go, he was there at the bend, not his body but the way the air had after a tall man has walked through it and left the lint of his shape. She knew he had used this path as a drawing pencil. He had made the town lean in on its own edges to see what he meant.\n\nBack at the station, Kline had gone from coffee to water and back again to coffee because coffee was a shovel and water a towel and he needed both to move what he needed moved. He had lines on his map that resembled ribs. He had placed the locations of the photographs and the edges and the attempted quiet and the seen and the seen-not-seen in a circle that was not a circle, shy of closure by two inches that were not on paper but in rain and knees and luck. He tapped the map with a pen he chewed like a boy, left a tooth in the plastic, and finally admitted the shape that the pins were trying to tell him without being rude about it. It was a mouth. It was the shape of a mouth, traced off the city limits, edged in fields and trestles and hallways. It had a lower lip fattened by the river. It had an upper lip torn by a road project from 1989 that no one had forgiven. He had been told in school that a circle was the simplest shape and the perfect one. He had never been taught how a mouth is a broken circle that keeps a person alive.\n\n\u201cTell me I\u2019m making patterns where there are none,\u201d he said to Claire when she came in, leaning on the doorframe like a woman who had gone to the swamp because the only god she believed in lived in mud. \u201cTell me I\u2019m looking at a loaf of bread and calling it a Bible.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at a mouth,\u201d she said, and did not enjoy saying a sentence that would sound in a week like something a woman says in a podcast from far away. \u201cHe is writing a sentence you can\u2019t hear. He thinks when he closes the shape the sentence will read. He thinks the room will obey if all the lines meet. He would have completed the lip at the gym. He would have taught us to be his word. He\u2019ll try again. Soon. You will not get to him with cars. You will get to him with corners.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorners,\u201d he said, as if the word had left him a tip. \u201cHe likes edges.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe thinks the center makes agreements it shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cHe thinks edges are pure. So you put a person he cannot ignore where two edges meet. You make a junction that bothers him. You put right where a wrong wants to live and let them argue.\u201d\n\nHe stared at her as if she had given him a riddle that was also a map and also a dare. Then he laughed the way a man laughs when he is so tired his face will only go one way and it happens to be the one that hurts less. \u201cYou know what my daddy used to say about you when you were ten and wrote letters to the paper about trains being mean to the night?\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019d say, she\u2019s going to grow up to be a person the town puts to work and doesn\u2019t pay. And he was right. And I am sorry. And thank you. And do you see why I don\u2019t have a dog. I can\u2019t be responsible for anything that looks at me like that every morning.\u201d\n\nShe smiled and didn\u2019t and went to the window because the window was where she understood what scale was. In the square, a man had set up a folding table with a handmade sign that said BRING YOUR NOISE and was selling kazoos in colors that hurt. Children bought them with dimes and parent permission and walked away and made indignities in public. An old woman bought a set of marbles and taught three small boys how to let them fall on concrete to make a sound like hail in a tin roof. A boy had a cowbell and no sense of when to ring it and the best timing in the world. In a week this would be tiresome and in a month it would be a story that made people blush. Today it was armor. Today it was a bunch of edges refusing to be tidy.\n\nThe next picture arrived where it would. On the inside of a church door, high enough you had to get the step-ladder people used to twist Christmas wreaths to reach it. It was a mouth again, but the mouth had lipstick on it that was crooked, a woman\u2019s I did my best at red. The note had nothing on it except a single drawn line, and the line had a dip in it, and the dip was the truth. It was the dip in the upper lip some people had and some did not and he had made a mark of it as if to say, I can see the small things too. Pastor Pruitt took it down and held it and held it and then put it in a Bible because men like him think anything put in a Bible becomes tinder-proof.\n\nHarv looked at that one and said he could smell on the emulsion that the film pack had been opened in heat and then shut and then cooled and that the person who did it did not sweat as much as he should. \u201cSome men don\u2019t sweat,\u201d he said, and shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t trust men who don\u2019t sweat. Even Jesus sweat. Even the devil.\u201d\n\nAt night, Leah\u2019s phone rang again and the caller didn\u2019t speak again and she spoke first, because that is a trick that belongs to women who have had to learn to be brave on a page. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only person who knows how to breathe,\u201d she said into the mouth of the phone, and then she laughed in his ear ugly and wrong and made him hang up because he didn\u2019t have a box for that and didn\u2019t like his boxes to be handmade.\n\nAl walked the abandoned spur line that ran behind the old cotton compress and measured where the moonlight avoided him. He had added the gym to his line in his head and been interrupted and hated the way breaks looked in patterns. He had arranged his pieces in the shed until they matched a picture in his mind that was a sound as much as a map. He had liked the way the room had gone quiet and hated the way it had gotten itself back like a fish he had had in his hand and lost in the grass. He had re-laced his boots tighter because his feet were too big for the laces, but the act of tightening them made him feel he had caused a smaller order. He imagined the mouth closed and the town shut and the river laid down its rattle and the birds forgot to sing and the trains remembered that someone had been here before them who did not need their announcement. He thought the word we again and tried to decide whether he liked it. It was a heavy word. He liked heavy words that you could hang things on. He didn\u2019t like Claire holding his name the way she had. He would fix that. He had plans for what people could and could not say, and her saying the wrong thing had been a splinter he would tongue until it bled.\n\nYou could see where this was going if you let yourself. You could feel the jaw of the town locating its hinge. Sheriff Kline made his cars sit at corners like bookends. The school district adjusted bells until the pattern was not tidy. The doughnut shop gave away free coffee to anyone who promised to slurp and provided plastic lids with holes too big. The courthouse clock went on the fritz and no one tried to fix it for a day because it made an interesting erratic song. A high-school band slept with their instruments and practiced in the Parking Lot of Bad Decisions behind the bowling alley until the notes went wrong and right and wrong again and that was better than right. Parents who never yelled in public stood on porches and told the dark they would not be made smaller in their own mouths. It sounded corny and felt like remembering how to breathe after being startled awake.\n\nIn the hours between three and four when the body loses most of what it borrowed from the day, Claire lay on her back and stared at the ceiling where cracks had daintily been made to look purposeful and wondered what it would be like if he succeeded. She tried the thought on as if it were a shirt someone had left behind at the pool. A quiet that was not a peace but a power. A quiet that made every prayer sound like it must be whispered to be good. A quiet that made all stories ground down to their bare bones and the marrow sucked out. She hated that kind of quiet with a bone-depth hate that surprised her. She had lived her life loving hush and this thing wasn\u2019t that. She got up and went to her desk and turned on a lamp and wrote a sentence she had been resisting and it felt like a bandage; it felt like a fight. She wrote: In the beginning was the noise, and the noise was with us, and the noise was us, and we did not know it until someone tried to take it. Then she wrote: In the beginning was breath, and the breath had edges, and the edges were where we learned who we were allowed to be.\n\nIn the morning she read what she had done and didn\u2019t hate it and hated that she didn\u2019t hate it and printed it anyway because some words need to be made into paper to be heavier. She took the page to Kline and he took it like a man takes a thing that is both bullhorn and lullaby and asked if he could put pieces of it on the county website and she said yes and he did, and somewhere a woman who had never thought the internet could make her safer read it and put her hand to her chest and said a name out loud she hadn\u2019t said in a long time and the shape of the name made that day bearable.\n\nBy noon, the rumor river had decided he\u2019d be at the Rivoli, the old movie house that made promises in the twenties and concessions in the nineties and was now a church for a congregation that liked its music tinny and insistent. It was a bad rumor and a good thought; inside, the acoustics would be a bowl he\u2019d hold like soup. Kline went anyway and found nothing but hymnals with brittle spines and a scrap of tape on the stage where someone had once marked center and then decided to be off it. He stood a long time in the dim and realized he had come to love the backs of rooms. He loved the backs because backs let you see people without being seen. He had grown up in a hardware store looking at the backs of men picking nails and thought that was what law would be\u2014helping backs hold right. He had been wrong and was learning even now how to be right in a different way.\n\nToward evening, when the air went wet and the trees put their hands on their hips, a school bus driver called it in: a man taller than sense walking along the ditch by the far edges of King Road where the asphalt becomes confession. The driver had three kids left, going home to houses where a light outside made a kind of statement, and she did not stop because you do not stop for men in ditches even when the men are not giant, but she said to the radio what she saw and then she sang loudly with the children on purpose, Row, Row, Row, and told them to be wrong on the word merrily, and they were, and they loved her for letting them. Kline was three minutes behind a cloud you could watch grow. He parked angled without meaning to and put his hand on the roof of the cruiser because his daddy had taught him cars had souls and deserved a pat.\n\nClaire was already there because a woman from the PTA had called Leah and Leah had called her and the string of calls had made a braid that meant action. She stood at the fence that hemmed a pasture with cows who had opinions about nothing and everything and saw him in profile, a cut paper hero in some wrong parade. He looked at the fence the way a man looks at a line he could step over and not be forgiven and then he didn\u2019t step over because he had rules, he had his own shames. He lifted the camera like a sacrament. He made the small square with his fingers before the square plastic could honor it. He was going to take a mouth out of the air like a coin out of a child\u2019s ear.\n\n\u201cAlessandro,\u201d she said, and it was not a tool this time but a hello. He did not like that any better.\n\nHe looked at her with the kind of disdain that is only available to people who have kept themselves away from laughter for years at a time. He looked at Kline with the contempt of a man who had measured and found him wanting and then had to adjust his math. He looked past them both to a place none of them could see, and she knew what he was looking at. He was looking at the last pin on a map he had made inside his head out of a woman\u2019s greatest hope and the edges of things that did not belong to him. He was looking at the mouth he would finish.\n\nShe lifted her hands without plan and without grace and held her fingers apart in a book of a gesture. \u201cWe grew up with a rule,\u201d she said, and was surprised to hear herself go there, to those dining tables and those girls and those warnings. \u201cWe were told when the dogs ran not to run. We were told be the tree. We were told be the knot. We were told be the stone. We learned not to be the river. We learned wrong. Rivers are loud and that is why we are alive. Be the river with me, Alessandro,\u201d she said, and the words were not pretty because prettiness is something that doesn\u2019t hold in rain. \u201cBe the river once and see if it kills you.\u201d\n\nHe did not lower the camera. He did not raise it, either. He held it at a middle where men hold things they think are both dangerous and salvation. His mouth softened for the first time Claire had ever seen it soften. It made him younger and made him ordinary and made him, in a strange, unpardonable way, beautiful. He opened it and she thought for a second he might give her a word. He did not. He closed it again like a door someone on the other side had tried to open. He turned away, which is something men with rules do when they have not yet decided to break them.\n\nAfter he was gone again into the trees he did not bend, a thing happened the way it has to in a book even when the town is tired and the writer is tired and the sheriff is thinner than his suit. A woman in a house at the top of the hill where the ditch turns and a pear tree leans had lowered her mouth to a child\u2019s ear and told him a story of a boy who wanted more silence than he could carry, and the child, who had perfect timing because children are timing dressed as people, lifted his kazoo and blew a note so wrong it went right, and the cows lifted their heads, and the sound went out over the field and into the first edge of the wood and back into the ditch like a handkerchief tossed and caught and tossed. You could have called it nothing. You could have called it a seed. You could have called it a beginning the way some people call storms early to scare them away.\n\nHarv took apart the cooler that night while his wife made soup that smelled like commas. He found a scrap of cloth wedged under a weight, a piece of pillowcase torn ragged as if someone\u2019s finger had caught and someone\u2019s patience had been outvoted by someone\u2019s hurry for once. He put it in a Ziploc like a man in a TV show he had never wanted to be and drove it over to Kline who bagged it like a man who had a whole drawer of bags and then said the thing men say when they know they owe you a thing and do not want to owe anyone anything: I\u2019ll remember this. Harv went home and kissed his wife like a first date and said he had touched the edge of a story and not been cut and she said, not today, and it was the most accurate prayer anyone had offered in town.\n\nWhoever was supposed to be keeping the fire in heaven lifted it then, a small, red, velvet corner of a sunset that made an oath it could not keep. Claire sat at her desk and wrote the chapter she had been putting off, the one about silence as furniture, the one about the kind of quiet that is a guest with a knife in his boot. She wrote about mouths without saying the word too many times. She wrote to try to arrange her fear into something that would stack. She wrote, because they would ask her to, the story of what had happened in the gym and she made of it not a brag but a recipe. She wrote: clap wrong. She wrote: break the counted. She wrote: there are men who make maps that hunger. We do not owe maps our bodies. We owe maps our ugly, square, stubborn noise.\n\nAt the edges of town, the crickets decided to tune and the frogs took their creek back and the train did its long moan and apologized to no one. In a shed that thought it was a body, pictures hung by clothespins stopped being hymnals and became a calendar. You could feel the day on them even in the dark. He lay on a cot that had more springs than mattress and counted his heartbeat down to a thing he could carry and swore to the ceiling that it would be quiet tomorrow and the ceiling rained plaster like a small studio audience expressing doubt. He didn\u2019t hear it because some men don\u2019t hear the room when the room is disagreeing. He did not sleep long. He did not sleep well. He dreamed of a river he could step across and did not know how to get his foot dry again.\n\nIn the morning the field where the boy had first climbed the cinderblocks had a small gathering whether it wanted one or not. People who lived nearby stood with mugs and opinions. A woman from the paper took notes like she was catching butterflies and planning to let them go in a lede later. Claire went alone because she wanted to see what the place looked like after being in a story, and it looked like a place that had not asked to be in one. The billboard still grinned rust. The fence still sang to the wind when asked with a finger. The boy was there with his mother again and he looked at Claire with the sacred solemnity of someone who had made a brave choice and been told it mattered. She knelt so that their mouths were closer to one another and said, \u201cYou did right,\u201d in a voice that made it sound like a secret and a proclamation both, and he nodded because children love permission and hate it equally.\n\nOn the way back to her car, Claire passed the alley where teenagers painted names at midnight and felt the air change. It was the kind of change that is only a degree and is everything. She looked up and there on the brick in white paint someone had written the oldest line in the book and made it new by facing it the wrong way. WE ARE THE NOISE WE KEEP, it said, and across town Leah read the same four words on a screen because someone had made a photograph and sent it to a friend because that is how air moves now, and Kline read it in the back of his head where officers keep their retired prayers, and Harv thought he might make a sign out of it and put it in the window of the studio, and a man in a shed misread it deliberately to keep from being hurt. He said to himself, I am not we. He said to himself, I am the quiet I make. He said to himself, tomorrow.\n\nThe circle on Kline\u2019s map still had a break at the top lip, two inches of unmade. He put his finger there and dared a man he had never met before to try it. He set two cars where streets made right angles and put a deputy at a hardware store his father used to own and a preacher at a skating rink that had been a skating rink when he was a boy and then been a church and then been a tax office and was now empty and looked like a mouth with a missing tooth. He asked Claire if she would do a thing that he had no right to ask, and he put the please in front of it like a word should be, and she said yes because she had been walking toward that yes since the first time she had heard dogs run.\n\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Leah said, with a teacher\u2019s terror that lives beside a teacher\u2019s joy. \u201cWhat are you doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to stand at a corner,\u201d Claire said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be a knot and a river. I\u2019m going to say his name where two edges meet and see if he knows the difference between an opening and a door.\u201d She smiled then in a way she didn\u2019t like and did anyway because truth lives in ugly smiles as often as it does anywhere. \u201cAnd you,\u201d she said to Leah, \u201care going to make parents practice being wrong. You are going to make them clap wrong and tell them the clap is a prayer. You are going to say the stupidest things the Lord ever blessed and you are going to save lives with them.\u201d\n\nLeah put her hand over her mouth and then lowered it and nodded and then laughed and then cried and then laughed again in a sequence that is, if you think about it, the Bible in six seconds. \u201cI can do stupid,\u201d she said. \u201cI am an expert. I have a certificate.\u201d\n\nThey put Claire where two streets kissed without privacy. They put her where the railroad cut a crossing and a chain-link fence decided not to be taller. They put her where it was ugly and true at once because ugly and true often share a bench. She stood with a paper in her pocket that said WE ARE THE NOISE WE KEEP in her own hand because she had copied it down because she believes in taking some graffiti home. She stood with a kazoo because someone had given her one and because an old woman had once said to her, take the gifts people give you even if they are shares in foolishness. She stood and waited and let the day measure her and felt the way the town turned toward her with one ear and a half. She could feel him too, out there counting, out there misreading. She had his name and he had her picture and between those two things there was a rope that could be pulled, and one of them was going to pull first. She hoped it would be her. She hoped, if it was him, that she would not go quiet. She put the ridiculous little plastic instrument to her mouth and blew once, wrong. It made a sound like a duck arguing with a door. It was beautiful. It was the beginning of a world where maybe no one had to give up their mouth to live.",

It was a kissing-point where two narrow streets found each other and then looked away too quickly, a railroad crossing slicing it into tinny quarters, a chain-link fence hemming a utility lot where coils of green hose went to grow old. Claire stood with her shoulder against a light pole that had been patched with a strip of roofing tin and a bolt, and when she leaned she could feel how the two metals disliked each other in a way that was intimate and permanent. Kline\u2019s people had done what they could without making a carnival out of it\u2014two cars half a block away pretending to be shoppers, a volunteer with a stroller and no baby performing the stand-and-visit that keeps a corner feeling used, an older man from the VFW who had been told nothing except that it would be helpful if he brought his harmonica and remembered nothing from the Army except he was allowed to be loud.\n\nHouses around them breathed their weekday breaths. A woman watered the square of grass between her porch steps and the curb as if the square were an animal that might bolt. A boy chalked a hopscotch course in numbers that refused to arrive exactly in order, hopping as he drew with a coordination that argued with itself and won. A man dragged a trash can that had lost a wheel and produced a beat so raggedly satisfying it might have been what a drummer hears in his sleep the night before a show he\u2019s afraid of. Claire kept the kazoo in her pocket not because she thought she would use it but because it was a promise to her own mouth that it was not only for food and apology. She watched the rail, because rails are honest outside of schedules, they tell you with a shimmer before they tell you with a horn, and she watched the fence where the world had the courtesy to declare itself.\n\nThe radio in Kline\u2019s cruiser kept up a low gossip of place-names and what-ifs, checks and backtracks and somebody saying sorry for stepping on somebody else\u2019s words. Leah\u2019s text came in like it was leaning against her leg. Kids are home. We\u2019re practicing wrong, it said, and after a beat came a picture: thirty-seven third-graders with their mouths open in wrong shapes, their hands clapped in mischief, Leah at the front with her arms wide like a conductor who had decided to conduct the weather instead. Claire smiled and this time did not stop it with her teeth. Across the street the VFW man cupped his harmonica and let out a line of something that started as hymn and ended as barn dance, a phrase you couldn\u2019t lean on if you tried. He nodded to her, and she nodded back like they were both members of a club that made whatever it needed out of what it had.\n\nAl moved like a set of measurements trying not to be seen. He came along a ditch on the far side of the tracks, keeping his feet in the beaten path that rainwater had negotiated with clay. The day tamped itself down as if preparing for someone to step on it. He had changed nothing about himself except the angle at which he held his shoulders, a small concession to roofs and wires, but even that made the air remember. He had in the bag at his back a device smaller than the gym cooler and meaner, built for corners like this, a quartet of scavenged cones set into a plastic crate that had once held oranges and now held a low lesson. He knew where he would put it. He knew what walls would help him and which would have to be taught. He had thought about this corner after he\u2019d walked it in the early part of the morning when church folks drive without looking and the dew stays on your bootlaces no matter what you do. He had put the line in his head where the map would close and then opened it a finger\u2019s width because he liked to come in sideways on his own plans, the way a carpenter cuts inside the pencil.\n\nHe saw her before she saw him because he had taught himself to see mouths from far away and the way she stood made the shape of her lower face distinct against the tired color of the day. He did not say her name in his head because names were for people who had earned them or for people you wanted to injure with the sound. He put her in the part of his mind where tools live. Useful. More useful if obedient. He adjusted the bag\u2019s strap because his hands needed order and because his father had always made him lift with both arms and so he had to be disobedient somewhere. He watched the rail. You watched the rail. The rail will betray a train before a timetable will. He did not mind trains because trains choose their own loud and have an honest horn\u2014four notes, call and answer like a riddle a child figures out by accident. He liked their rules. He did not like what lived under their rules, which was the mess of people.\n\nKline felt the change before he saw the body that had caused it, one of those policeman things that is more animal than training and which he would deny if asked and then admit on the day he filed the papers to retire. He straightened without deciding to straighten. He put his hand not on his gun but near the place where his belt holds a human still. He flicked two words into the radio because quiet talking is a kind of magic in a small town: on foot. He looked at Claire and found her eyes already on him and did not have to give her the rest\u2014the not yet, the not if you can help it, the please that he was learning movie sheriffs never say and real ones use as a lever.\n\nThe man in the ditch gained ground without gaining speed. He had a way of passing space like it was a friend you didn\u2019t hug in public. He set his foot on the rail to cross and the rail made a noise like a struck guitar and the tone was the measure of his weight. Claire felt it in the part of her chest that had learned to read lines of music in church and hated every minute and loved it too. She slid the kazoo out of her pocket and rubbed her thumb along the seam of its plastic mouth, a small sacramental gesture no one saw.\n\nHe lifted the crate and tipped it, just enough, to see how the sound would meet the brick backs of the low buildings and the underbelly of the bridge and the fence. It was all edges here; he smiled with the part of him that knew this was a good choice. He could close something at this corner and no one would call it art but it would be art anyway, the kind that makes a room obey. He placed the crate where two cinderblocks had become community by mere proximity, set to make a stand for a plant that never made it out of its black nursery bucket and had died without adding its green to the corner. He turned the knob like you turn the dial on an old radio to find something you know is there because you once loved it at night and it has to be here somewhere in the hiss. He pressed the button. The air put its palm against the room.\n\nClaire had told herself to go first and she did not. The first sound came from the old man with the harmonica, an accident that was also a lesson. He saw the man set a thing down and his mouth made a sound at the same time his hands did; it started as a note and became an objection, the harmonica\u2019s bent reed stamping its small foot in protest. It was the wrong pitch for protest and perfect. The pressure met it and tried to flatten it and couldn\u2019t decide where to put its thumbs. Claire took the kazoo\u2019s insult into her mouth and blew a note that sounded like a goose wising up. She turned her own body into a corner by pivoting and stepping into the angle of the signpost and the light pole and let the air squeeze past her, and in the slipping through the edge lost a little of its rightness, and that was the trick if there was one.\n\nThe VFW man caught on fast and wrong, which was what she needed. He took his harmonica off his mouth and smacked his palm with it in a rhythm that refused to keep company with itself. The woman with the watering can banged it against her railing because that was what was in her hand and because this town, for all its failures, had always known what was to hand. A teenager with a skateboard came realized into this corner from the next and laid his deck on its grip and slapped it with a heel, slap-slap-rest-slap-rest-rest in a pattern only he knew and which made the air nervous because it could not make a pattern of him first. Someone in the car behind Kline leaned on a horn and then took their hand off and then pressed again, four times, five times, nothing like trains and that was better here.\n\nAl felt the failure like a man feels the give of a board underneath him and knows to move his foot and knows also that if he stalls he will be thrown. The crate did its work with the dumb fidelity of the built but the corner refused to be taught. He looked not at the noise-makers but at Claire because he had already decided where the hinge was and he did not enjoy being wrong. She looked back at him with a mouth she refused to make into a symbol and he hated the plainness of it more than he had hated anything in a year. He did not lift the camera. He wanted to keep his hands for the thing that would do more. He stepped forward a single step and the world took that step like it had been practicing.\n\nKline came out of the car like he had never been in one, that clean. He didn\u2019t go for the crate because his foot told him it would be a waste to kick a rope when you need to cut a knot. He went to the man because men are where things start no matter how many machines we build to pretend otherwise. He came to stop two strides off because two strides is where a man has the dignity to choose and you have the dignity to take it away if need be. He set his hand to his side in a way that said I have it and I don\u2019t want to use it and I will. He didn\u2019t speak at him yet and that was the part of himself he did not recognize and liked. He waited in the noise and let it call him a fool and a hero and the father of all wrong children.\n\nThe train did a thing then that was strictly scheduling and purely theater. Its horn took the far crossing with the legally required measure\u2014a long, a long, a short, a long\u2014and the shape of it cut the corner open and let the pressure go running the way a bad dog bolts when the gate forgets itself. The crate\u2019s work stumbled and couldn\u2019t find its feet in the new air and by then Claire had come forward to close two human edges around it, her and Kline, a corner of bodies, the thing in the middle forced to listen to a geography that hated it. Al read it as disrespect and that was right and a mistake. He had underestimated how much a small place can want itself and how ugly it is willing to be to keep wanting.\n\nHe moved like a man who\u2019s decided that a plan needs brute in it now and reached for the crate to change its angle and Claire did the unglamorous thing and stepped on his cord. It wasn\u2019t bold; it was housewifely, and it worked because electricity loves a certain kind of insult. The plug cocked and the hum went to its knees and in the instant before his hand got to the wire he looked up at her and she said his name, not like a weapon and not like a prayer but like a gate she was holding with both hands from blowing open. \u201cAlessandro,\u201d she said, and the syllables laid themselves across his chest like a wet towel in summer and his lungs hated it and loved it because the body does not get a vote.\n\nHe jerked the plug without looking and she was ready for it because most harm is a tug and most resistance is a foot. The teenager with the skateboard had seen men yank cords all his life and had learned the counter and he slid in close and dropped his deck on top of the crate as if he were playing a game only he knew the rules to, and the sudden weight and the dull rubber of the wheels made the thing cancer into quiet. Kline put a hand on the camera not to take it or to break it but to take the aim away from it and felt the man\u2019s hand under the leather not resist so much as refuse to decide. That was the trick in him that was going to get him caught one day\u2014his love of decision until the moment arrived and then his delight in the breath before it.\n\nThe horn dragged the air like a comb through a head of hair and everything separated into strands again that you could see. The world looked cheap and friendly as it does after a scare that did not get to be formal. The old man said something like a curse and like a benediction and probably it was both exactly. Al bent in a way that suggested he could take the world apart if he lived long enough and gathered his things not because he had been beaten but because this was not the shape he wanted his failure to be. He looked down at the foot on his cord and then at the kazoo in Claire\u2019s hand and then at Kline\u2019s palm open on the camera and he put his mouth in a shape that people draw when they draw a mouth and have not looked at one in a year. Then he turned and carried his measurements away along the ditch because edge is retreat and attack both if you do it right.\n\n\u201cYou good,\u201d Kline said to nobody and everybody, the question-call of a man in charge of a room that has woken up with a bruise. The old man laughed like a rain barrel emptying. The woman with the watering can was crying from the wrists out and desisted only when she found she had set the hose down wrong and it was drowning a patch of the street that could not drown. The skateboard boy picked up his board and looked at the bottom of it as if expecting to see the imprint of the evil he had sat on. Claire breathed like she had paid cash for a breath and had better use it.\n\nA deputy who had been playing shopper came up in a posture that coupled apology and adrenaline, hands out to show he had nothing in them and so much to give. \u201cWe got a call from near the compress,\u201d he said to Kline, words sparking off his teeth because speed was not his friend and he knew it. \u201cThat old shack. The one with the tin letters still up from the tire place. Somebody says there\u2019s a kid. They heard tapping. They heard it and tapped back and it tapped like a child. I sent Rosales. He says it\u2019s the boy from the fence,\u201d he said, and sounded like he had been given back a thing he had already made a funeral for.\n\nClaire\u2019s throat made the small ugly sound a body makes when someone has removed an anvil you didn\u2019t know was there. The woman with the hose put both hands over her mouth and not because she had been told to. The old man wiped his harmonica on his shirt as if it had sweat, as if it had worked. Kline closed his eyes and leaned on their lids like he had not slept enough and would not for a while longer, then opened them and they were useful again. \u201cYou go,\u201d he said to the deputy, \u201cand tell Rosales not to keep the mother outside if he can help it. Let her in if the boy can bear it and tell him it will be ugly and right at the same time, and that is a day\u2019s work. And get the ambulance to come slow. No siren until they are a block away, because he might have had enough of the wrong sound for today.\u201d\n\nThey went because nobody had to be told twice to go toward a child they could see now in their head. The corner eased like a jaw unclenching. The train went on and made its commitments to the next crossing down. The crate sat there like a red-eyed dog, hum killed, waiting for a new instruction. Kline squatted by it and peered into its cheap heart. \u201cWe\u2019ll let Harv have the throat of this,\u201d he said, half to Claire and half to the object, and the object did not disagree because objects rarely do.\n\nHarv looked at the crate later in the day with a craftsman\u2019s calm that had a sliver of triumph in it because something had been put in his hands that could be undone without hurting anyone else. He ran a finger along the lip where plastic met patience and shook his head with admiration he did not want to own. \u201cHe\u2019s learning from himself,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is cleaner than the cooler. Less to go wrong. He made it uglier and it improved the trick. He\u2019s got a mind some part of me would hire if the rest of him wasn\u2019t taking up all the space in the room.\u201d He lifted a speaker and tilted it and let the tiny rattle of trapped gravel tell him where the man had stood when he\u2019d put the thing down. \u201cSee that? He\u2019s not as careful as he thinks,\u201d he said, and showed Kline the grit in the glue line. \u201cHe\u2019s working on dirt. He\u2019s bent over a sill.\u201d\n\nRosales came in with news that walked like it had been drinking. The boy had been found. The boy had been fed. The boy had been held in a place where holding is a verb that makes your hands hurt later. He had been told to be quiet and had obeyed the way children obey adults who sound like they know what a room is for. He had tapped with a key he\u2019d found under a radiator and had liberally misunderstood the sequence for S-O-S and it had not mattered because misunderstanding is sometimes how you get somewhere fast. He had a rope burn on one wrist and none on the other, which meant the man had taken breaks; he had laid down between his own rules. He had left a cup of water and a half-slice of bread and a small clean towel and a note in a stack of Polaroids that said, Don\u2019t make noise. The boy had made noise anyway and had saved himself by being wrong.\n\nClaire went to the compress lot because she had to see the door jamb where the hinge had been given too much to do and the sheet of tin where He had cut a neat rectangle and then slapped it back so sloppily that anyone who had ever loved neatness with a fierce love would look away. The shed in the back had his breath in it still, a mechanical smell braided with a sweetness she knew from other enclosed rooms\u2014a smell of film, that peculiar vinyl vanilla that people mistake for nostalgia and is in fact chemistry. She stood at the line where the light changed from outside to inside and saw the neat line of Polaroids clipped up like laundry and it made her stomach perform an old circus trick she had retired. There were mouths and there were mouths and there were a few false starts where the edges had bled into the border and those he had not kept. There was the one Harv had found of his wife. There was the one from the billboard leg. There was hers. She knew her mouth anywhere after the last two weeks had taught her to glance at reflective glass and not be surprised by the arrangement of her own face. He had not been content with her unjust ugliness. He had kept the one from the gym and developed it carefully and it was there hanging with the rest, the unhandsome, unbordered refusal. She felt herself split in two neat halves, one that wanted to be sick and one that wanted to stand taller. She did neither. She stood still.\n\nThe boy was in an ambulance he did not like because it was too bright and he had spent his bravery budget already. His mother had ridden in the front because the back would have embarrassed both of them and because she had been given a choice and had made it with the little spear of pride that every good mother keeps just to keep from drowning. Leah sat on the curb after and let the concrete tell her she was still heavy. She looked at Claire and the look said three things that couldn\u2019t share a sentence: why do we live like this, I\u2019m glad we do, I want it to end. Claire nodded because nods can hold three things if you make them slow. She would not cry yet, not here, not where crying would feel like making noise for noise\u2019s sake. Later, alone, she would cry and she would put her pillow over her face like a child afraid of the dark and call it a study in suffocation, as if the name could make it friendlier.\n\nThat night, the town did what towns do when the weather has lifted and they are not yet convinced it will be kind tomorrow; they went outside. They leaned on fences that had been white once, they let their dogs be unproductive, they talked across distances an arm cannot span, they ate on porches as if porches deserved to be thanked for their years of service. Someone hung a string of mismatched Christmas lights over the square and no one asked who paid the electric. The doughnut shop put a folding table on the sidewalk and stood a crockpot full of something that wasn\u2019t coffee and wasn\u2019t soup on it and the sign said FREE and nobody asked which kind of free. Harv hung, in the window of his studio, a piece of paper with the words WE ARE THE NOISE WE KEEP in letters his father would have disapproved of because they were crude and because Harv had cut them with a utility knife poorly and because the letters leaned like friends. The teen from the newspaper took a picture but did not post it online yet because for once he wanted a thing to sit in a window and be only there.\n\nAl lay on his cot in the shed and had never been more awake. The cot made a sound when he moved that was louder than the sound he required the town to give up, and the irony would have amused him if he liked feeling anything. He had not liked the way the boy had tapped. He had not liked the way his own hand had written the words Don\u2019t make noise with the care of a child copying from a chalkboard; that had been a mistake to do it himself and not make the machine carry the message. He had not liked that a rope had burned a wrist and would show. He had not liked that Claire had stepped on his cord because that was a housewife\u2019s trick and he did not want to be vulnerable to the habits of kitchens. He had not liked that the corner had refused to be a door. He said to his own chest, tomorrow, and the chest did not promise the way a mouth might, it beat, it insisted, it kept the time of his making.\n\nHe had known hunger as a boy that had nothing to do with food and everything to do with the noise adults made at each other. He had learned to sleep under a table with a hand over his own ear as if he could press the world out of his head. He had found in the photographs that there is a way to excise only the part of the face that betrays the rest. He had told himself he was an artist of reduction. He had told himself art was not cruel because art is beautiful and, like most men who tell themselves neat lies often enough, he had found ways to keep evidence away from that sentence. He did not sleep and the arrhythmic crickets in the weeds beyond the tin wall made him ache because they had charmed the night into believing they had a right to it. He would fix that. He had a line to finish. He had found the top lip on a map without letting the map know he was reading it.\n\nKline put a pin into the paper with a force that made him wish he didn\u2019t care about maps. The circle had its mouth; the line was a mouth; what needed closing was obvious now in a way nothing had been yesterday. There was the overpass near the service road that had been poured with a pride that didn\u2019t match its budget and always sounded tired. There was the water tower\u2019s ladder where no one had fixed the missing rung because everybody had memorized it. There was, most obvious and therefore least likely, the courthouse steps where speeches go to be empty and high school seniors go to find echoes they can pretend are agreement. He didn\u2019t think it would be any of those because he had learned that the man loved edges that were also private. He looked at the skating rink again on his paper and at the warehouse with the tin letters and at the rivoli and at the threshold of the gym and then he put his finger on a place he had not loved as a boy, where the drainage culvert goes under the road at King Road and opens its iron mouth into the ditch. It was private and public; it was mouth and edge; it was a sentence and a correction. He told two cars to go there and a man with an orange vest to stand on the bank and pretend to be city and a woman who could run faster than men thought to be in the shade. He did not tell Claire because he could not ask her again, not tonight, and because he knew without knowing that she would be where edges met whether he asked or not.\n\nClaire wrote until the lamp made a halo on her desk that did not belong to any saint. She made sentences and broke them on purpose and then made them again. She wrote, clap wrong, and she wrote, call him by the name he was given in the kitchen of a rented house, and she wrote, teach your mouth to be a door with a lock you own. She thought about the boy\u2019s key tapping and wrote, tap even if you do not know the code, and then crossed it out because she did not want to issue commandments and because every commandment invites a man to police it. She wrote instead, be heard crooked. She wrote, if the shape is a mouth you must refuse to be its lips. The printer made its domestic noise and she loved it like a clock in a house where someone old is sleeping.\n\nThe morning slipped over the town with a look of mischief as if to say you thought you knew afternoon? Watch this. Someone rang the church bell at ten not on the hour but because he wanted to, because he kept the key and there was nothing in the by-laws to stop him. A woman set a metronome on her porch rail and wound it and then knocked it off with the back of her finger so it swung like it was being teased. The teenagers met behind the bowling alley and tuned the wrong way and one of them remembered an uncle\u2019s CB radio and wired it to a car battery and discovered by accident that if he set it on a metal trash can, the can talked back. These were stupid things and holy ones. The town smelled like late peaches and oil.\n\nAt the culvert, the city man In the orange vest kept up a cheerful lie with his clipboard as if he counted everything and could therefore control anything. The woman in the shade twisted the strap of her sandals around her fingers and practiced not humming. The deputies in the cars pretended to be bored in the way men pretend to be brave. It was the kind of place you could close your eyes and still see because it had been in more small boy adventures than any state test could measure. The water came out and made a sound that the man at Harv\u2019s shop would call white and the rest of them would call day. A crawfish had built the kind of cathedral that only crawfish build and had decorated it with what it had.\n\nHe came because of course he did. He came because even men who think they choose their own places live in towns that have been choosing for them since they could walk. He came in the long step of someone who has learned how to use his length to look like he is in a hurry when he is not. He came with a new thing on his shoulder, a bag that had once been a mailbag with leather softened by hands, the kind of thing that makes a person look like a story as soon as they put it on. He set the bag down in the mouth of the culvert and the culvert accepted it like a communion and the air changed the way it does when rain goes from idea to rule. He had a hand on the strap when the woman stepped out of shade and said his name because saying nothing would have been a betrayal of her own throat. \u201cAlessandro,\u201d she said, and it made the culvert drop a note and pick up a new one.\n\nHe did not turn toward her. He turned toward the orange vest because the vest was a color that had been making demands his entire life and because he had never liked colors that did not occur in nature. He lifted the bag again and then he did a thing that no one expected and which, if it had been written down in a police report, would have looked like a lie. He took from his pocket the cardboard circle on a stick he had left on Claire\u2019s porch and held it up to the mouth of the culvert and framed it. He framed the mouth within the mouth and smiled, and it was a terrifyingly ordinary smile, the kind a man gives when he has remembered a joke he never got and feels proud for pretending. He set the bag down like a gift. The woman stepped backward because instinct is older than training and because the water had told her, in its way, to get taller ground. The deputies moved forward with their hands like waiters carrying trays of certainty.\n\nThe sound that bag made when it woke was a different animal. It did not push the air so much as attract the least part of it and stitch it to its neighbor and then their neighbor until the room around the culvert learned a hum that felt like being pulled through a sieve. The culvert amplified it and turned it into a suggestion that knees could make agreements with chairs. The woman grabbed the edge of the fence and let the chain bite her skin into diamonds and it kept her where she meant to stay and not where the sound would have preferred her to be. The city man made a face like he tasted cinnamon where he had expected salt. The water tried to add its own voice and discovered it had been written out of the measure and added itself anyway. It is difficult to mic a creek; he had not planned for that and for one moment he loved creek for the wrong reason.\n\nClaire did not run again. She walked fast and felt her breath as a unit that needed to be carried precious and upright and not spilled. She came to the culvert corner and did not see him first, she saw the bag in the mouth and knew it had an appetite. She went not for the bag but for the signs that said, in their old paint, City Property, because sometimes you have to interrupt a sentence before it becomes law. She swung the sign on its single good bolt and it squealed into a sound the bag could not predict because rust is an improviser. The deputies put their hands flat on the hood of their car and made a drum. The orange vest clapped the way children clap when they have been asked to show a stranger their talents and their talents are still their own. It looked silly. Someone in a house above the bank turned on a vacuum cleaner because that is what she had, and the sound bent the trees on a frequency that made the bag hiccup.\n\nAl had come for the last line and he was getting a chorus he did not want. He did the thing that he had done at the gym and which had failed there and which he believed would not fail here because men with plans always think a new room will love them. He lifted the camera. He lifted it because when he had nothing his hands could make sense of, he could always make a square. He framed Claire because that was the square he hated and wanted. He clicked and the square woke and the chemistry began to guess at what it would be and she lifted her kazoo and blew one long wrong note into the mouth of the culvert and made one child on a school bus a mile away look up because he could feel that someone was letting the air be wrong on purpose. The picture came out and he shook it not because it needed it but because men shake things when they are impatient and like to see liquid learn. He looked at it because he could not help it; he had taught himself to love the reveal more than the result. It showed a mouth; it showed a mouth; it showed something that might have been hers if she had been someone else. He had not caught her. He had caught an idea badly made, and it made him frown like a man who has stepped on a nail he meant to save for later.\n\nKline had been coming up from the under of the culvert with a pace like a man who had learned to be sure on wet concrete and at the moment the man\u2019s attention went to the square he put his hand on the bag and slid it backward the way you pull a cake from an oven prematurely and it collapsed in on the sound with such a small meekness that he wanted, briefly, to spare it. The bag whined and then lied about not knowing how to whine. The culvert was itself again and the water rushed, embarrassed by the interruption but unpunished. The city man with the vest did the brave stupid thing and kicked the bag into the shallow and watched the river make a joke of electricity and hoped for the best. It sparked like a small Fourth of July being ashamed of itself. The woman in sandals laughed and hated that she laughed and laughed anyway because her body had kept the receipt for delight and presented it at the wrong counter.\n\nAl looked at Kline then with attention and it was like being stared at by a building. There was no malice in it, only the weight of his disappointment resting on the nearest table. He put the camera back into its pillowcase because he had learned that some acts are cheapened by the air. He stepped back and it should have been a mistake because there were men who would step forward if given that permission, but that was not what this town did with permission anymore. He turned not to the road this time, not to the ditches he loved, but to the cut through the trees where deer made their own law, and he moved through it without bending a branch because courtesy was something he knew when it had leaves on.\n\nThere were a dozen reports that night of a man that tall walking that slow along the edges of other people\u2019s yards, and most of them were wrong and a few were true and all of them were proof that a town, once taught to see, will see even when it does not want to. Leah\u2019s phone lit again and she did not answer and she sat with it in her lap and said a student\u2019s name out loud and the phone went quiet and she had not known it would. Harv picked a sliver of solder out of his thumb and put it on his desk as if it might grow into a flower and closed his eyes and thought of his wife\u2019s mouth not as a picture but as the first place their older son had smiled. Kline took his map down and put it back up and put it down again because he could not bear to see the shape of the line and could not bear not to. He put a tack in the culvert and the tack pressed through paper into cork with a sound that the town would have recognized now if it had been standing exactly where he was, which it was, in a way.\n\nClaire went home by the long way because the air had gotten into her hair in a way that made going home too quickly feel like a lie. She passed the alley with the graffiti and someone had added beneath it in smaller hand: AND WE ARE THE HUSH WE PICK, and she wanted to argue with the unknown hand and wanted also to hold it. Her porch had a letter on it and it was not a letter because it had no envelope and it was not a postcard because it held no picture; it was a square like the ones on his line but it was blank and she hated that and loved it because blank is a better threat than a promise sometimes. On the back, in the neat boyish hand that did not marry the body she knew from the ditch, were four words: TOMORROW WE WILL FINISH. The we was still there and still wrong and still seductive because we is how songs begin. She brought the square inside and put it on the floor under the table where the legs had a nick in one and her mother had kept a book under it to cancel the wobble. She did not put a book under it now. She let the table wobble. She let it.\n\nMorning came with a headache and a blessing. The boy from the fence woke up in a hospital room that had been painted the impossible blue of a particular hour in a particular Mississippi spring and asked without words with his mouth for his mother and she was there and he was given a cup with a lid he did not need and an ice chip and a permission slip to be loud later. The paper ran a headline that said LIGHT STAYS ON and no one liked it and everyone kept it. The men who fix things rolled up their sleeves with a little extra civility because someone had asked them, not ordered them, to take care. The school band announced a concert at noon in the square with the caveat that people would be asked to clap like they did not know what clapping was, and parents bought earplugs and did not tell their children it was in case, they said it was for the fun of the thing.\n\nKline met Claire on the courthouse steps because some habits make sense even when they are bad, and because you can see farther and less from up there than anywhere else. He had a paper in his pocket like a teenager. He had written the names of the places he thought were left that would satisfy a man who needed to complete a shape and could not stand to be told no by corners. He handed it to her and she folded it without looking and put it in her jacket like a person who understands spells and hates them. Neither of them brought up the we in the note because words have spines and you can feel them in your throat if you say them and neither of them had time for that kind of bones.\n\n\u201cDo you think he sleeps,\u201d Kline said finally, not because it mattered and because it mattered more than it should.\n\n\u201cNot in a way that helps him,\u201d she said. \u201cNot in the way that makes a man remember he belongs to a body.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not afraid enough,\u201d he said, and there was admiration in it and a complaint and a hand he offered without offering.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid like a drawer that\u2019s stuck,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid in a way that stays useful when I need plates.\u201d\n\nHe laughed and then stopped and then laughed again because he loved being made to say stupid things that were true. \u201cYou coming to the square at noon,\u201d he said, aiming to sound casual and landing where he always did when he asked her to do a thing she shouldn\u2019t have to do: earnest and a little ashamed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather be where a map thinks it ends,\u201d she said, and they both looked at the culvert in their heads and the water tower and the skate rink and the bit of road that had never decided whether it was a street, a lane, or a place.\n\nHe gave her the look he gave people who chose to do the thing he was going to have to ask them to do anyway. \u201cDon\u2019t be brave,\u201d he said, and it landed on the step between them with a sound like a coin and like a seed.\n\nShe went anyway. She walked to the road that was not a street or a place and stood in a noon that had found a cloud and was pleased with itself for it. There were few people there, which is a different kind of courage than a square full of band. The train was an hour off and she had never been so aware of timetables that were made by men. She held the blank square he had left her and bent it once and unbent it so it would remember being changed. She thought about the first sentence she wrote after the gym and about the cruelty of fresh pages and about mercy with teeth. She thought about his grandmother or the woman who had pinned his life to a line and how he had learned to love clean things and how that love had ruined him.\n\nHe came like weather that has checked the clock. He came without a machine because he was confident that humans are machines too and he could press them. He held the camera like a dovecote and it was foolish how elegant it made him look. He stopped in the middle of the lane and the lane did not mind it, lanes are worse than roads that way. He set his eyes on her mouth and she felt it the way a woman feels the sun on the back of her neck in a dress that cost more than her paycheck really allowed. She tasted plastic because her teeth reminded her of the kazoo and she had not brought it because she didn\u2019t think jokes would help. She had brought the one thing that would make his hand tremble. She had brought his name.\n\n\u201cAlessandro,\u201d she said, and for the first time he winced and didn\u2019t hide it. He lifted the camera and she lifted the square he had brought her as if she were in on his trick and put it between her mouth and his lens and framed herself and he hated it more than he had hated anything because he had not given the permission for that framing and because she had made him a we with a cardboard circle and he was a man who had sworn that word off.\n\nThe shutter clicked and the picture came out and the emulsion began to be itself. He did not look. He saw himself, in his head, in a room with clothespins and he hated that he could hear wind through the slats. He saw his father\u2019s hand putting nails in a jar and calling it sorting and he despised the jar for its accuracy. He lowered the camera and he might have said a word then. He might have said no. He might have said mine. He might have said please. He closed his mouth around all of those words like a man closing his hand around a bee, and whether he meant to save it or kill it was not clear even to him.\n\nA patrol car turned at the far end of the lane too sharp and too soon and the driver cursed himself for stopping a poem with an engine. The horn he laid on was the wrong sound at the right moment and it tore the day in half and someone on a porch who had thought to be useless and had not been took a lid off a pot and dropped it on concrete and it skittered in a language the bag in the culvert would have hated. The picture in his hand revealed itself with a small shiver, and he looked because you look\u2014and what stared back was not a mouth. It was the cardboard ring with her fingers in focus on both sides, the cut edge of her defiance, the thing he had meant to make a tool turned into a mirror. He had caught his own shape on the inner edges where the circle framed him wrong. Behind the ring, blurred but deliberate, her mouth was open, not pretty, not clean, speaking, a mid-sound that could not be read as yes or no. He had collected the un-collectable, and the rage that rose was old and unoriginal and he despised that about it most.\n\nHe took a step that took too long and that was enough. Kline\u2019s hand found the part of his arm you can hold a man by without breaking him, and that was all it took to make the camera tilt and the square drop, and the wind, which had been sleepy, woke and took the picture a foot. Claire stepped on it not because she wanted to own it but because some things must be stopped before they join and become story. He wrenched and Kline let go because letting go sometimes keeps a man in a room better than grip does, and the next moment was no one\u2019s and everyone\u2019s, and if you asked ten people later what they had seen you would get ten true things.\n\nHe did not run and he did not stay and he did something between, a shuffling grace that got him out of the middle and to an edge, and the edge made a choice for him because he had taught edges to make choices. He vanished into the narrow green where the ditch makes a lie of asphalt. Kline did not chase because he had learned something about himself that morning, and it was that he loved his life and the count of it more than he loved arrests you boast about in bars. He would get him. He believed this with the kind of faith he wished he had for other things.\n\nClaire stood with her shoe on a picture of herself, a self-outside-of-self, and looked down at the circle, at the cut dull gray of cardboard, at her own fingers blurred, at the idea of a mouth that had been trying not to become an idea. She lifted her foot and took the square with two fingers the way you take a spider you would rather not kill. She slipped it into her pocket with the paper where she had written WE ARE THE NOISE WE KEEP in her own hand. She felt ridiculous and alive the way you do when you have been lucky and have not yet paid for it. She walked back toward the square because the band would be starting and because she wanted to hear the wrong clapping echo off the courthouse and make the history inside it roll over and cough.\n\nThey had put folding chairs out as if the town would be polite and then abandoned them as if the town remembered itself. Leah stood on a milk crate and pointed at nothing and made meaning anyway. The trumpet player who ran the tire shop blew a note that had swallowed three others on the way in and arrived fat and satisfied. Children clapped and threw away the count like a bad toy and found that their hands could make and unmake a room. Kline stood at the back with the faces he loved and the faces he had made and the faces he did not know yet, and he let them wash him in ugly, beautiful, useful noise until his eyes stung and his law loosened and tightened at once.\n\nIn the shed that smelled like sugar and trouble, a string of Polaroids stirred because air moves more in rooms that have been argued with. One clothespin, old wood with a spring that had seen better, gave up. A picture fell and landed at an angle and leaned against the leg of the table where he had placed the welders and the cutters. It was a mouth, it was three mouths, it was an error he had kept because even neatness allows for trophies of failure sometimes. It looked, in the slant, like a canyon. He was not there to see it because he was at the edge of a different room deciding how much longer he could be a man who labeled his own boxes, and somewhere in him the word we rose again, stubborn and reasonable, and he hated it and knew he would use it when he meant I, and the thought made him strong and it made him tired and the town, which had learned its shape and would go on learning, made its noise and kept it.",

The square wore last night\u2019s laughter like a shawl. Grocery carts rang against one another as if to demonstrate the difference between an accident and a rhythm. Down King Road, a woman hung damp sheets with clothespins that had belonged to her grandmother, and each pin clicked with a tiny, private vote for ordinary. The town had the look of a place that had been frightened into remembering that it liked to be alive.\n\nClaire woke with the ghost of a headache and the stub of an argument at the back of her tongue. The blank square from his note lay on her kitchen table where she had left it, and the corner she had bent and unbent held its crease like a healed bone. Her house had new sounds now\u2014bells she had hung on the inside of the front door that knocked together when the AC kicked on, a child\u2019s wind-up music box a neighbor had left with a note that said for luck, the anxious thrum of a fish tank someone had abandoned at the curb that she had taken in and filled with water even though there were no fish. She had made her house rude on purpose. When she stepped into the hall, her heel caught the edge of a wooden spoon she had dropped there the night before, a booby trap that was also an invitation, and the clatter made her laugh in a way closest to a cough.\n\nShe put on coffee and left it to burn while she wrote down a thought she did not trust herself to hold in her head during the half-minute it would take to pour. The dip in the lip, she wrote, and underlined it. The lipstick in the church photograph had marked the bow of the upper lip\u2014the little ravine some mouths have between nose and Cupid\u2019s mouth\u2014that had been his drawn line. His map, she saw now as if someone had traced it with grease pencil, had included that dip. You finish a mouth with a cleft. You give it definition. You make it a mouth in more than outline. The water tower had a vertical line painted down its fat belly where the city had been measuring rust the year she graduated from high school and had never painted over. The catwalk halfway up made the thin line cross the round and make a feature on a face. If you were a man who made your map out of an anatomy you hated and needed, that was where you would go to be finished.\n\nShe called Kline to tell him a thing he had already circled in his head and he did not sound annoyed to hear his own thought back at him. He sounded relieved that thoughts could be communal without making him smaller. \u201cWe already put eyes there,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they can\u2019t live there. They\u2019ll scare him wrong or they\u2019ll make it into a scene and he wants a scene. I sent a boy to sit on the hill like he\u2019s sketching and I sent Mrs. Landrum to walk her dog and I asked the mayor to develop a desire to count rivets, but that\u2019s cover and no net. He\u2019ll come in weather. He likes the air to do the heavy part. We got a storm late afternoon if the forecast isn\u2019t bragging. You know how thunder lets gentlemen do things they don\u2019t want witnesses for.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll use it,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019ll make it part of the sentence he\u2019s writing. He\u2019ll borrow the bass and give it the verb. You need to make the sky stutter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t own a sky,\u201d he said, rueful the way men get when they admit the limits of their badge.\n\n\u201cYou know people with sheet metal,\u201d she said. \u201cAsk the shop to lay out boards and hammers and tell folks to make their own thunder wrong. Ask the church to ring the bell on the up-beat and then forget the beat. Tell the band kids to bring pots. If he uses the sky, you make it answer itself in a way that messes with his grammar.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou terrifying me with how pretty that sounds,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I hear the part I need.\u201d\n\nAfter he hung up, she stood at the window and watched the neighbor\u2019s pecan tree drop last year\u2019s bad shells in a steady confession. The sky had the tight, oily look of a day that will get violent at dusk and forgive itself by dawn. She called Leah without planning to and got her on the first ring. Leah was in the gym with a handful of teachers and a custodian who had never in his life been paid enough to love the sound of a floor polisher. \u201cWe\u2019re teaching clapping like we had to teach it to foreign exchange students once,\u201d Leah said with odd cheer. \u201cWe\u2019re inventing mistakes and awarding prizes. I have never felt more useful and more foolish and I\u2019ve been a teacher in a state with a legislature.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter school, go home,\u201d Claire said, hating herself for the boss in her voice and needing it. \u201cGo home and make noise in your kitchen. If a friend comes by, let them. That thing he brings\u2014if he brings it here\u2014will like the neat of this room too much. Make it messy before he gets the chance. Teach it what a home does when it has to be a weather vane.\u201d\n\nLeah laughed, then swallowed the laugh in that involuntary way of late fear, and then released it again because the room needed it. \u201cMy father would say you\u2019re a woman with a broom telling a storm where to move,\u201d she said. \u201cMy father would be right and I love him more for it most days.\u201d\n\nThe boy from the fence asked to see Claire and she walked to the hospital with the printout of the words she had made that people had taped to windows and church doors as if paper could keep out a doctrine. He was sitting up in bed with a plastic bracelet on his wrist that made him look like someone\u2019s experiment and he had a drawing pad. He had drawn the giant wrong in a way that made it better than right. He had drawn him as a shadow with holes where eyes should be and one of the holes had a moth in it. He showed her the picture and the picture made something behind her sternum go soft and old.\n\n\u201cYou counted wrong,\u201d she said, and he looked alarmed until she smiled. \u201cYou counted wrong in the way that saves a person,\u201d she added. \u201cKeep doing that.\u201d\n\nHe bit his lower lip the way children do when they want to memorize their own faces. \u201cHe moved quiet,\u201d he said. \u201cHe looked like when the moon goes behind a cloud and then decides not to. I wanted to say his name. I couldn\u2019t think of a name for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cNames are earned,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe him one.\u201d\n\nHarv called mid-morning with his mouth full of the language of bolts. \u201cHe pulled these cones from a particular kind of sound bar,\u201d he said. \u201cNot the cheap ones. The ones with red cloth on the ends that folks buy because they like to pretend their winter is theater. There\u2019s only one place around here that still sells them because everybody else went for the Bluetooth candy. That outfit off the bypass that makes you sign for everything like a mortgage. The manager there is a man who keeps a list of who owes him. He will remember a man like a lightning rod. He will remember the way his elbows moved. He will remember whether he paid cash careful or cash sloppy.\u201d\n\nKline sent a deputy in his Sunday shirt to be nice about it and the manager remembered better than nice. He remembered a man with hands like a stovetop choosing the box with no barcode on it like some men choose seats on a bus. He remembered the way the man stood on the square of mat near the cash register and made the chime not ring, a trick that should not be possible. He remembered a name not because the man had said it but because he had said what he wasn\u2019t. \u201cNot Alan,\u201d he had said, when the manager asked if he wanted a warranty. \u201cNot that.\u201d He had smiled the way a man smiles when someone calls him handsome on the street. \u201cAl,\u201d he had allowed. \u201cJust Al.\u201d The manager gave the deputy the footage from the camera over the counter and apologized for the picture quality as if shame could make pixels grow teeth.\n\nThe state boys arrived in a car that looked like a bar of soap sharpened at the ends. They shook hands the way men who know their hands will be held in lieu of thanks shake hands. They used words like tactical and psychological operations and one of them had a degree in a thing he had never properly been allowed to love. He walked the shed and breathed the air and surprised Claire by being mournful about the Polaroids. \u201cThere\u2019s a tenderness in this cruelty,\u201d he said, more to the air than to her. \u201cThat makes it worse, or better,\u201d he added, and then took himself out of the room so he would not say something else foolish and true.\n\nBy noon, the sun had decided to preen. Heat hammered the sidewalks. The square filled with the band kids and the worst rhythm section in the county. A man from the city rolled a fifty-gallon drum to the courthouse steps and a boy with a stick made it talk and then sing and then complain. Claire stood in the back with her paper folded to a talisman and watched people she loved elect to be unlovely for an hour. It was marvelous. It was terrible. It was effective. It got under the skin of the day and made it itch.\n\nClouds muscular as men rose in the southwest. Kline pointed at the water tower with his chin in that way his father\u2019s generation had turned into art. \u201cWe do not go up,\u201d he said to the pair of deputies who were younger than his daughter would have been if his life had gone another way. \u201cNot in daylight. Not when we can see our own hands. If I can see you, he can see you. He\u2019s got the patience to wait until light lies. We can put a man at the base who looks like nobody. We can put a car a block out that looks like a car belonging to a man who doesn\u2019t like to go home for supper on time. That\u2019s what we can do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do we do with the wind,\u201d one of the deputies said, and because it was a joke, they all laughed as if they had told it.\n\nThey did what they could with wind. They asked a roofing company to lean sheets of tin against sawhorses with cinderblocks under the open ends so they would speak in a small voice when the storm slouched through. They asked a man who liked to rebuild mufflers to pretend for an hour that he didn\u2019t. They asked the woman with the church key to ring wrong. They asked the train dispatcher if the next engineer could hold the horn longer than company likes and he said he could not say he said yes and Kline said he would not say thank you, then they looked at each other in relief and guilt the way men do who are making exceptions together.\n\nClaire went home and put on her mother\u2019s shoes, which were ugly and solid and meant for standing a long time in a kitchen and she loved them for being honest about their purposes. She filled a canvas bag with things she would have mocked last year\u2014a pot lid, a rolled-up stretch of chain, a bundle of old keys on a ring the size of a palm, a child\u2019s tambourine with three of its jingles missing. She added a coil of clothesline and a handful of clothespins out of habit and superstition. She put the blank square in the inside pocket of her jacket with the corner filed toward her like a tooth and tried to decide if she was being brave or if she was building furniture out of fear and calling it useful. She compromised and called it a bench. Benches do not win wars, but they let people sit and decide to keep going.\n\nAt three, the first lick of thunder laid its tongue along the far hills. The air went greener than a living thing should be. The town found places it remembered hiding as children and then didn\u2019t go to them. That was the point. They stood on porches and left doors open and put radios on stations nobody liked and turned them up. They banged hammer handles on the undersides of tables. They loved their errors in public. Down by the tower, Mrs. Landrum let her dog pee on the same post three times in three directions and told it it was a genius and the dog believed her and wagged its tail faster than the day required.\n\nHe came when the third thunder spoke, because the third is the telling one, and because he believed in sequences more than he believed in God. He brought a canvas bag he had found in a pawnshop with a faded name stenciled on it that he had half scraped free; it had belonged to a man who\u2019d traveled for a little team that wanted to be a big team and the ghost of that ambition pleased him. Inside the bag were a ring of speakers nipple-small and rude, an array the size of a clock that had no time, a coil of wire that he had lifted from behind a print shop\u2019s broken plotter. He carried a length of EMT conduit cut with a dull blade to wedge the bag where he would need it and he carried a short-handled hammer because hammers have souls and pronounce themselves in ways other tools do not. He had a roll of tape that had been applied to other things before and took it personally, and a camera because he was himself and would always be until something interrupted him.\n\nThe tower was a town in miniature. It had habits and rules and a ladder everyone knew to be missing a rung and solved with a step wider than comfort. He moved like he had measured it in childhood and someone from a second-floor window said later that he made the ladder look like a cane for a man too proud to limp. He made no noise his own bag didn\u2019t generate. Rain began like static and then like accusation. He climbed into it because rain quiets footfalls and also because his skin had never made peace with water and he liked to punish it as if it had disobeyed him by being what everything else was made of. He got to the catwalk and let his weight teach it his name.\n\nOn the ground, a deputy with a baseball cap pulled low looked up and kept looking up until it hurt. He spoke into his shoulder and the shoulder told the next shoulder and pretty soon shoulders all over the county knew the man had gone up and what town do you know that is good at leaving it alone when a man goes up. Kline came at a trot that would cost him at eleven, running like a man who had learned to run toward because running away had always made him easy to hate. He did not look for Claire because he knew if he did he would find her and he could not afford to have two problems in the same air.\n\nClaire was already there because if she could smell rain, she could smell the place where a story decided to finish itself. She came in her mother\u2019s shoes and set her canvas bag down at the foot of the ladder like an apology and then collected it because she did not need apologies today. She wrapped the chain around her forearm and stood where the metal leg of the tower met concrete, an edge that was an edge, and she put her mouth to it and spoke his name in the way you have to speak if you want your sound to ask the thing you touch to carry it farther than you could on your own. The leg took her voice and played with it like a tuning fork testing a tabletop. The rain heard her say Alessandro and turned it into static, and up on the catwalk the man stopped without making an admission of having been stopped.\n\nHe set the bag where the catwalk curves and the line would intersect the round if you were the kind of person who drew lines on photographs with pencils. He wedged it with the conduit and taped it with the tenderness he saved for objects and never for bodies. The array had a mouth, and he set that mouth toward the town he planned to make his instrument. He flicked the switch with his nail as if nails were made for electricity and not for turnings of earth. The sound it made was not sound. It was suggestion. It was the way a room suggests people should sit, the way a church suggests hands should fold, the way a courthouse step suggests speeches are not acts but obligations, the way a father\u2019s belt suggests certain jokes are not jokes anymore. It ran along the ribs of the tower and into the ground and under the courthouse and along the clay lip of the creek and into bright kitchens and dull rooms and out through the open window at Harv\u2019s shop and made the string on the clothespins tremble like new foals.\n\nThe bells in the church couldn\u2019t find which way to fall and then did fall in a pattern you could only call a tantrum, and it was magnificent. The roofing tin rattled and warred with itself, not becoming music, refusing. The band kids beat trash cans and the trash cans remembered their first assignments in the world and did it badly on purpose. The train on the far side of town held its note too long with a willful pride no machine ought to own and then chopped it like a cheap saw and no one in the cab smiled, though later they would, alone, in their kitchen chairs. The tower stiffened like a thing affronted by insult. The array pushed and the town pushed back. It was not a draw because draw is a neutral word and nothing about this was neutral. It was a fight where neither party could touch the other\u2019s skin and made do with the things that had.\n\nHe lifted the camera not because he needed it but because he had taught every other part of himself to be disciplined and the camera was the one part he allowed to be disobedient. He pointed it at the town in general because this was not about face anymore and then he brought it back down toward specificity because he had seen, below, the one mouth that would not be fixed to his frame. Claire had stepped out from the leg and into the open and her face was the kind of brave that has a tremble under it that makes it generous instead of crazy. He wanted to take that tremble from her. He wanted to own the before and the after. He wanted to prove that if you capture the mouth, the rest of the body will remember its place.\n\nHe knew her voice would rise through the tower before he heard it in his ear, and he turned to meet it as a man turns to meet a lover who is leaving. She did not say his name this time. She said we and she said it as if it belonged to her as much as it had ever belonged to anyone. \u201cWe are the noise we keep,\u201d she said, into the rust and the rain and the metal with its own memory. \u201cWe are the hinge. We are the ugly note. We are the clapping wrong at the end of what was supposed to be your song. We are the pothole nobody filled and the metronome pushed off a porch and the dinner party where the story is told too soon and makes the room believe it is a room without a guest,\u201d she said, and he despised her because she made a sentence and then made it more than a sentence, she made it into a wall.\n\nKline started up the ladder because sometimes it is a policeman\u2019s job to be exactly where he ought not to be. He found the missing rung by history and not by eyes and made the wider step that would cost him in a knee later and didn\u2019t care. Rain lifted the smell of the tower\u2019s old paint into his nose and made him young again and more tired than he had been at nineteen. He went slow because the tower did not belong to him and because the man above him had patience and men with patience can turn speed into a liability.\n\nLeah had brought her class to her living room because the school had been released early and because parents had looked at her in the parking lot with the same naked question: what now. They clapped wrong at the television when the weather man pointed at the county and said words that had been emptied by use and filled by need. They clapped wrong at the cat and the cat tolerated it with the resignation of saints. They clapped wrong at the phone when it buzzed and ignored it when it would not stop, and then Leah picked it up and said, \u201cWe,\u201d and the line went dead as if a wire somewhere had been cut by a thought.\n\nHe adjusted the angle of the array on the catwalk because a man who has found his enemy will always blame angle for why the enemy still breathes. He did not look down. He did not look up. He looked at the part of the town that resisted him and hated it and loved it in the way a man hates and loves the brother he cannot stop measuring himself against. He told himself that what he was doing would be remembered as a kind of art with a mean mouth because art with a mean mouth is the only kind the world respects without permission. The tower treated his sound like a rumor and passed it on badly, and every time it did he ratcheted the bag a fraction, the delicate, obsessive adjustments of a man who has never had a hobby that didn\u2019t draw blood.\n\nClaire looped the chain through the ladders\u2019 lowest rung and made it kiss the metal leg in a way that would produce a small stubborn disharmonic every time the wind decided to speak. It was petty and it was effective. She tied the clothesline to the chain and made a web that would carry her insult higher, patient as laundry. She tapped the pot lid with the back of a spoon the way she had once demanded a dinner she did not want in order to make her mother laugh, and the tower learned to hate tin where before it had been indifferent. She did every wrong thing she could as beautifully as she could manage and then uglier, because ugly is stronger if you treat it right.\n\nThe rain came harder. It made the catwalk into a proof, a thing that says this is true of all catwalks, and the man took careful steps in his soaked boots because he was not a fool; he was only foolish in his devotion to an idea that made other people\u2019s lungs his business. Kline reached the curve and saw the bag and felt the way his heart tried to match its pulse to the hum it was making and refused. He went to his knees because he was tired of ruining pants being the difference between a man living and a man not, and he put his hand on the wet tape because touching is a friend of victory in a way distance never will be. He did not yet pull because men who pull without knowing what is on the other end sometimes destroy a thing they can\u2019t make again. He spoke to the bag as if it had registers that needed polite greeting. \u201cYou had a day,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are done now.\u201d\n\nAl turned and saw him and the look they exchanged was one of those long arguments men have at stoplights with their chins. There was no bravado left in either of them, just work and a little disgust at the way their bodies had made them into the men they were. He lifted the camera because muscle memory is faster than hate and quicker than law. He aimed not at Claire and not at Kline but at the ladder itself, and he clicked, and the square came out and he held it between finger and thumb and the rain doilied its surface in wavering white. He watched as if the face of an answer might lift up out of the milk and tell him who he was and what he should do next and it did not, it showed him the rungs of a ladder and the shape a man\u2019s spaces between will make if you draw them.\n\nLightning hit a mile away and the thunder made the city shiver and the array tried to take the thunder into its mouth and failed because thunder is a god with its own doctrine. The bag hummed and said, in its way, I have done my part. Kline made his choice and tore with his hands and with his heart and the tape gave like a conception and the bag shifted and the conduit bit the catwalk rail and prayed to stay and then did not and slid and struck his shin and made him say a word you only say to a man you love or a machine that has almost taken your hand. The bag swung and hit the angle iron and bounced and then was less sure of its position in this world and then it fell and the sound it made on the way down was one long embarrassed vowels you could have translated if you had been inclined to be generous.\n\nIt hit the ground and died like a toy beyond repair. The tower shuddered in relief the way a body does eventually when you stop pressing a bruise. The air remembered it could be air again and not instruction, and it stood up straighter and then it slumped because storms take their tithe. The rain exaggerated and then gave back the exaggeration with interest. One of the band kids, miles away, felt suddenly better and did not know why and put it down to finishing a scale without missing the note he always missed.\n\nAl stared at the space where his bag had been like a man looking at the plot of ground where he had planned to build a thing that would impress himself. He did not roar. He did not even close his fist. He recalculated with a speed that should have impressed anyone paying attention. He stepped toward Kline in a way that was neither threatening nor friendly but looked like the footnote to those words and Kline met him with the open hand that said later, I had no choice but that lie is always available. They balanced on a catwalk that had opinions about weight and the rain wrote a long sentence on their shoulders the way rain will when it has been asked to be theater and has agreed reluctantly.\n\nClaire stood below in her ugly shoes and had the thought you have to inventory before you can hate it properly: if he falls he will crush me and he will break me and if he does the town will remember me kindly and that is not how I want to be remembered. She stepped out of the way of that thought and put her body under a different idea. She stepped toward the ladder as if encouraging it to be the center of all things and she spoke, not to the men, but to the metal. She said, \u201cHold,\u201d and the tower, which did not care about English or the way it makes promises, did anyway.\n\nHe lifted the camera again not to shoot but because he did not know what else to do with that hand. He had spent years making it a friend and now the friend could not help him. He looked down at the square in his other palm and the rain had obliterated its argument. It was a blank with a memory of having once considered an image. It looked like a thought that had been interrupted in the doorway and had been too shy to come in. He held it like a dead moth.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to finish,\u201d Claire shouted up, and it was not a trick sentence. It was a mercy she wasn\u2019t sure she had a right to offer. \u201cYou can leave the lip open. You can refuse the circle. You can let us be ugly and you can say you had enough of clean. You can be the man who stops a sentence because he has remembered that the period is not a mercy if what it ends is still breathing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to be my we,\u201d he said, and his voice came down the tower as a flattened thing, but she understood it anyway and flinched as a person does when a word hits a bruise from a previous word. He took a step back on the catwalk because he wanted to see her face and he wanted to make sure his foot knew the pattern of the metal for next time and he wanted to be a person making choices and not a person being taught and that was when the ladder shook in a way that belonged to old hardware and not to men.\n\nKline reached without thinking and had a hand on the man\u2019s sleeve and the geometry of it was bad. Weight shifted toward a number no one had planned on. The catwalk wanted to let go of something and couldn\u2019t decide whether it would be its bolt or his wrist or the rain that made it sick. They hung like a question mark carved out of meat and intention. Claire felt their gravity reach through her shoes and into the ground and she wanted to scream but screaming is a frequency easy to count and she had taught her mouth to hate being counted in this last week and so she laughed, ugly and unmusical and wrong, a scrape you would not record and play for friends later, and the sound was so poor the tower did not know where to put it and chose to put it down. The catwalk remembered that it was metal and therefore obedient under certain circumstances and one of those circumstances had arrived and passed. It held.\n\nThey stood, the three of them, separated by ladder and rain, bound by the physics of a town that had decided to be alive. None of it was beautiful and all of it was true. He looked down at his hand, the one Kline had had to touch in order to keep him on the right side of the vocabulary of death, and he did not pull away. He did not reach back. He held still in the way that says I will make a choice later when you are not watching and let us both pretend. Kline, who had been a man long enough to understand the value of pretending, did not force the moment to declare itself. He took his hand back and let it hang by his side and the feeling in it was a throb he would not admit to anyone.\n\nThe rain thinned like a promise. The clouds ran out of speeches. The tower smelled like something you would keep in a garage and apologize to. He lifted the camera to his face at last and then did a radical thing for him: he lowered it without taking a picture. He slid it into the pillowcase and tied the knot with a tenderness that implied marriage and death. He walked the catwalk to the ladder without haste and when his boot hit the rung that wasn\u2019t there he made the wide step like a man born in this town and then he made the rest of the descent a sentence with commas, steady and annoying. He stepped onto the ground and the ground accepted him because ground does not have a politics beyond gravity.\n\nPeople had come without organizing themselves and they left without applauding. Mrs. Landrum\u2019s dog had decided to be brave and had peed on Kline\u2019s tire in an act of solidarity that the dog could not explain and none of them wanted to interrogate. A boy on a bike had watched from the next street and would tell the story later in a way that made him the hinge and nobody would begrudge him that because being a hinge is a kind of work. Leah walked up with a child on each hand and a third clinging to her sleeve and she nodded at Claire in a way that said she was paying with interest on a debt that was good to owe.\n\nHe did not run and he did not submit. He walked into a ditch like a man who believes ditches were made by men exactly like him and therefore are owed to him. He moved along the edges the way he always had. The town did not follow him because it had learned that following is a music and he loves music too much. They watched him lessen and they did not make a plan because they were plan-tired, all of them. Kline let him go because sometimes what you let do not tells everyone else it can be done and this was not that day. He did something instead that felt exactly like his father unlocking the hardware store in the morning and flipping the sign and sweeping the front walk\u2014the ritual that says we exist again after a night. He turned to Claire and said, \u201cWe put a man at the shed,\u201d and she nodded, \u201cand a woman,\u201d she added, and he pretended he had said that part first.\n\nEvening came with a sweetness that felt undeserved and they took it because taking good things without argument is the reward for the rare correct day. Harv nailed a piece of tin to the back of his studio door with a single nail at the top so that it would sigh when someone entered. The doughnut shop ran out of coffee and refused to brew more because the owner had learned that scarcity makes a room quiet and he was opposed to it. The old man with the harmonica took it out on his porch and played nothing in particular and people walking by felt their bodies make adjustments they would not name.\n\nIn the shed, which had been visited by men with gloves and a woman with a camera who made photographs that did not stay in their squares but roamed, the line of Polaroids shivered on its string and then held still, as if to acknowledge that there are rooms where likeness has to wait for meaning. One clothespin sprang and did not break and a photograph slid an inch and settled. It was the one of the church lipstick, the crooked red, the human effort visible where it usually attempts to hide. Claire stood in the doorway with the state man and with Kline and with Leah, who had come because she had supervised enough art projects to have earned the right to stand in rooms where images get made. They looked at the mouths and did not say the word mouth. They listened to the rain finish making its point on the tin roof. They began, without telling each other, to think about the day after this one, and the day after that, and they did not yet call it hope because hope is a clean word and the day was not clean. They called it clear, and that was a word the town had always been able to love.\n\nHe slept and did not. He lay on his cot and listened to the insects call to one another in a language he did not make and could not control, and it made him incandescent with a grief he would never permit himself to name. He dreamed that he had closed the circle and the town had obeyed and he had walked through it like a preacher through a murmur and then something had happened to the quiet, it had failed to be his friend, it had become merely an absence and not an instrument, and he had woken with the word unfinished in his mouth and the taste of tin in his teeth. He swore to the ceiling the way a man swears at a horse that spooks at a shadow he cannot see, and the ceiling had learned to ignore him.\n\nMorning took up its chores. The sky did not apologize. Children ate cereal with small percussions in bowls. The train made its promises to the crossings and kept them. The water tower, clean and factual, held its body.\n\nAnd in the alley where the town\u2019s new words had appeared on brick, another hand had added a line, thinner than the rest and careful in a way that made you want to scold it and hug it both. WE ARE THE NOISE WE KEEP, it said, and beneath, AND THE QUIET WE CHOOSE, and under that, smaller still, NOT THE QUIET WE ARE MADE. People passing nodded as if the brick had spoken a greeting and they were too well mannered to leave it unanswered. A woman stopped and ran her finger over the chalked letters and found, to her surprise, that they did not come off on her skin. The rain had set them. The town had decided to keep this one. It would not be wiped away with the week.\n\nKline brought to Claire a sandwich he had not made and did not claim had been made for her. He set it on her porch and sat and admitted by the position of his hands that he had used them today for things that did not require force and had been grateful. They did not talk about plans because plans had been their diet and they wanted fruit. They spoke of Leah\u2019s student who had demanded to be allowed to write a report on the physics of wrong clapping, of the boy from the fence who had asked if he could keep the rope that had burned him because he did not want it to burn anybody else and then had accepted a compromise and kept a length of clothesline instead, of Harv\u2019s wife who had told Harv to stop granting evil so much craft and to come to bed.\n\n\u201cHe isn\u2019t finished,\u201d Kline said finally, not to bring the air down so much as to keep it from getting above itself.\n\n\u201cHe thinks finishing is owning,\u201d Claire said. \u201cHe thinks the circle is a deed. But there are mouths that never close. There are mouths you can\u2019t finish. There are stories that refuse to end even when the last sentence looks like a period. He hasn\u2019t met those yet and I don\u2019t know if we are the people to introduce him or if he will find them anyway.\u201d\n\nKline stretched his legs and his old knee spoke in a language he would be fluent in soon whether he liked it or not. \u201cWe got time,\u201d he said, and the word we did not feel like theft when he said it. It felt like a hand on a porch rail and a dog asleep in the daytime and a woman stringing clothespins on a line. It felt like a sound that did not need to apologize for itself or explain how it learned to be ugly.\n\nHe stood and picked up the paper from her porch and put it under the leg of her table out of habit because that is what you do when you see a wobble and you can fix it without a committee. The table steadied as if to say, this is all the engineering I require. He tipped his hat which he did not wear except when the world asked him to act the part of the man his daddy had taught him to admire. He said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be stupid again tomorrow if we have to,\u201d and she said, \u201cI\u2019m counting on it,\u201d and they left the porch having believed each other.\n\nAt the edge of town, where the ditch elected to be a creek again and the trees made a vote for shade, a man taller than sense paused to look at water that would never be his. He put his hand out and felt the air on his palm the way boys hold their hand to a wind out a car window and teach themselves what a wing is. He said a word that might have been we and might have been no and then he left the word behind on the lip of the bank like a coin balanced on the edge of flipping, and the creek, tactful and ruthless, took it and turned it over twice and did not report the answer. The day had work left. The noise was in the keeping. The quiet would be chosen or it would not. The town continued. The map wrinkled. The circle waited, open like a surprise that might be mercy and might be simply unclosed.",
