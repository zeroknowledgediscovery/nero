     "novel_text": "The day the duck wandered into the workshop on M-15 in Mussafah, there was already a heat haze over the asphalt that made the buildings seem to tremble. Nour had been under the chassis of a Nissan Patrol with the ratcheting wrench clacking in a rhythm she could keep with her breath. Oil had soaked through the knees of her overalls, the stripes of grime on her wrists matching the blackened crescents under her nails. Somewhere outside, someone was playing a pop song too loud from an open pickup, the bass thudding like a nearby generator. The air smelled of rubber and the sweetness of leaked coolant, and the voices of men rose and fell around her, bantering, arguing, speculating about a weekend barbecue on the beach.\n\n\u201cNour,\u201d called Bassam from the office door, \u201cyou see this? Your cousin brought lunch.\u201d\n\nHe meant the delivery guy who always stood just outside the threshold to keep from tracking sand over the painted floor, the one who liked to tell everyone he was related to them. She slid out from beneath the car on her creeper, wiped her forehead with the back of her hand, and squinted into the brightness. When she sat up, the shadow moved. It wasn't the shadow that startled her\u2014not really. It was the shape within the shadow, tottering, the sound of webbed feet on concrete, the quizzical tilt of a head.\n\nThe duck had a patchwork of white and mottled brown on its back, and a beak that looked rubbery, almost playful. It waddled straight through the gap in the partially open roll-up door like a shopper who had taken a wrong turn in a mall, sniffing the air with what might have been suspicion. It was absurd in the middle of tool chests and compressors, as out of place as a violin at a drag race.\n\n\u201cI told you people to keep the doors closed,\u201d scolded Arif, the owner, but he was grinning. \u201cHe thinks we\u2019re a lake.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a she,\u201d said Bassam authoritatively. \u201cYou can tell by the\u2014by the\u2026 um.\u201d\n\nThe duck came closer, peering at a coil of hose, nibbling at nothing. Nour knew ducks\u2014the way a child knows them, by the way they looked in picture books and at the park near the Corniche. They were part of the peaceful vocabulary of water and grass. But here it seemed wrong, their presence borrowed from a green place and set into metal. Something in her stiffened.\n\n\u201cShoo,\u201d said Arif, flapping his hands. The duck stopped, blinked, and then as if horrified by Arif\u2019s flapping, begin to flap in turn. Its wings beat the air. In an instant there was a blur of feathers, a machine of them, and a shrieking sound that surprised everyone. The first wing beat knocked a plastic tray off a workbench; sockets rattled and scattered, rolling like coins. The wind of it hit Nour in the face and she jerked back, banged her head against the undercarriage of the Patrol, cursed, and saw feathers snowing in the air beneath the harsh fluorescent lights.\n\n\u201cClose the door!\u201d someone yelled.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t close the door,\u201d someone else said, \u201cwhat if it gets stuck inside?\u201d\n\nThe duck wheeled, and in its panic it did what panicked creatures do: it became bigger than itself. It filled the room. Nour scrambled backward on the concrete, the heel of her boot catching on the creeper, her hip slipping, the wrench clanging away. A wing beat near her ear, close enough that the vanes brushed her cheek, soft and crisp at once. The smell\u2014she\u2019d never noticed that smell\u2014wet straw and something sharp. She threw her arms up to protect her face. A ridiculous thought cut through everything: it could peck out my eye. It could peck at the soft part just below the eye where there is no bone. And for a spun-out second the world did tilting in a way she didn\u2019t recognize, the sound of the wingbeats becoming a ceiling fan turned to maximum in a room without windows, the light too bright, the floor not level.\n\nThen Bassam got the door open all the way and the duck flung itself toward the glare, out and away with a final commentary of quacks that sounded like laughter. The air settled. Feathers drifted down, soft as receipts. Tools were gathered. Someone made a joke about roast duck this evening; someone else joked about omens. Nour sat on the concrete with her knees up and her hands over her ears, breathing. She pried her hands away with care as though they were stuck with glue. When she stood, the blood rushed out of her head and then back in with a wave that made her sway. Her cheek felt warm where the feather had brushed it. It could have been the heat.\n\nArif handed her a bottle of water without looking at her too closely. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d she said, and was annoyed at the thinness of her voice. \u201cJust surprised me, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nBassam peered at her face. \u201cYou\u2019re a little pale.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always pale,\u201d she said, which wasn\u2019t true. She had her mother\u2019s brown, and the sun laid another layer of it on top. She took a long drink and then went back under the car because she did not want to have a conversation. The ratchet clicked: that was what she trusted, simple mechanics, the way torque delivered its argument through your forearm. The duck was a glitch in the system, the same way an alarm that goes off for no reason in the middle of the night is a glitch. You fix the glitch and you don\u2019t make it a story.\n\nExcept it became a story.\n\nWhen Nour went home that night to the apartment in Al Nahyan where the elevator always stopped one floor too high, her mother was on the phone to an aunt, the TV was on low to a Turkish drama, and the smell of cardamom drifted from the kitchen where rice was cooling. Nour kicked off her boots at the door and tried to make her entrance the way she always did, with normal weight, not collapsing.\n\n\u201cAlhamdulillah,\u201d her mother said, planting a kiss on her temple. \u201cHow was your day? Your hair smells like the workshop.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had a visitor,\u201d said Nour, and she should have stopped there but she was tired and just the tiniest bit amused at how ridiculous the truth was. \u201cA duck.\u201d\n\nHer mother\u2019s eyebrows went up as if someone had pulled them on strings. \u201cFrom where?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mangroves, probably. Or someone\u2019s farm. It came right in.\u201d Which was much safer than saying: It came for me.\n\nHer mother laughed; the aunt\u2019s voice on speakerphone wanted to know what this duck looked like; her mother held the phone to Nour\u2019s ear and demanded that she tell the story again but funnier. Nour studied the kitchen tile, the little chips in it that had been there since they moved in. She made her voice light. She said, \u201cIt was big and stupid and Arif was afraid to touch it,\u201d and listened to the aunt\u2019s shrieking laughter and thought, good, this is a story, we have placed it in the category of stories, we will not carry it into sleep.\n\nBut sleep is a place that doesn\u2019t always care for categories. When she closed her eyes, she saw wings and could not tell if they were bird wings or the tilting blades of ceiling fans. She woke at two in the morning with the sound of quacking so present that she walked to the kitchen to look out of the window to the concrete below, as if the duck had followed her home up seven flights. There was nothing there but a boy on a bicycle cutting a shadow across the streetlights. She went back to bed embarrassed by her own ribs heaving.\n\nThe next week, Nour found that she walked faster along the Corniche when her friends invited her to meet them after work. She did not look at the water where it peeled itself like silk and lay down again across the sand. She didn\u2019t want to see anything gliding. When a child fed a pale slice of bread to a gaggle of ducks in the park and the little animals surged forward with their pretty greed, she crossed the street, and told herself, Why not, why not, it\u2019s hot, I\u2019ll get a drink. She stood in line and ordered lemonade and forgot to add sugar and drank it anyway.\n\nAt work, the story traveled. It was Bassam who told Tariq from the shop two doors down, and Tariq told his cousin who worked at the tire place across the road, and by the end of the day, the security guard at the gate said, \u201cSister Nour, you should be careful\u2014if a duck bites you, you will quack forever.\u201d He was so pleased with himself he clapped his hands together. She smiled, because he was kind and she was, most of the time, kind, too.\n\nA week later, a contractor who brought in an engine with a bad head gasket looked Nour up and down with the expression of someone testing the weight of a new tool in his hand. \u201cYou are the duck girl?\u201d he asked. He was not unkind. He was just amused by a detail he\u2019d been given in a world of rusty details. She wanted to give him something sharper back, but she said, \u201cNo, I am the mechanic,\u201d and he shrugged and didn\u2019t say it again. The work is the work, she reminded herself. She loved the work. She loved the way a problem had layers, the way you could listen to an engine and be a doctor listening to a heart. She loved the click and the press, the way bolts sat in the mind like beads on a string.\n\nIf fear were an animal that left footprints, Nour would have followed it to its hiding place and coaxed it out. But fear leaves prints in the mind and spends the day licking them away. She hadn\u2019t been afraid of birds before that, not specifically. She had always laughed at her cousin Huda, who screamed at the sight of moths like they were ghosts. But now she felt\u2014ridiculous\u2014like there might be a duck in the office bathroom. The thought came to her at work in the middle of the morning, as she hung a pneumatic impact wrench back onto its hook. It was so embarrassing she flushed alone, told no one. On her day off she took a taxi to Eastern Mangroves and decided that she would walk, that she would look at the birds there and be fine; she would stand on the boardwalk and be the calmest person in Abu Dhabi. She walked for ten minutes and turned around, a cartoon of a person walking toward a thing and then away. A duck had looked at her. That's all that happened. It saw her and it knew she was a new thing too.\n\nNot everyone was generous.\n\n\u201cGrown woman,\u201d sniffed Arif one afternoon when the story came back again, long after the feathers had been swept. He was not mean. He was a practical man with practical eyes. \u201cAll kinds of people have jobs they can\u2019t do; one time a crane operator came to me with a headache so bad he cried. This is just a duck.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrother,\u201d said Bassam, who was younger and loved to philosophize because he had not yet found the weight of his own failures, \u201cyou are too serious. One day a duck will return as your teacher.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I will offer it a coffee,\u201d said Arif, and looked at Nour, not unkind. \u201cYou are okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m finishing the Saab this afternoon,\u201d said Nour, because she hated the way the question felt in her chest. The Saab had an electrical ghost, a drain on the battery somewhere nobody could find, and her hands were the hands for this job: careful, patient, not wanting to smash anything with a hammer.\n\nShe had another life too, in the evenings, the one her family celebrated while they disapproved of it: night classes at the university, the campus where palm trees lined wide promenades and students sat on fat beanbags and argued about nothing with the fervor of philosophers. Nour had started taking classes years ago because she was curious in a direction that felt like falling. Machines led to physics; physics led to space; space led to something that tasted like a poem. Her mother told her, \u201cMaktoub, whatever is written for you will come,\u201d and then also, \u201cYou should get married by thirty,\u201d and then also, \u201cOh, my heart is proud,\u201d and all of these were true at once.\n\nThe tutor she loved the most did not love her back, not in that way. He was not even a he. She was a woman with hair like a sheet of straight iron, glasses she took on and off with an intentionality that made her seem like she was cutting cloth. Her name was Soraya Haddad. She had an undercurrent of Damascus in her emphatic syllables, and her laugh was a tick of sudden silver. She taught a course with a name that was a mouthful\u2014Applied Fabrication for Aerospace Prototypes\u2014which in practice meant that they built small things that wanted to fly and measured why they didn\u2019t. Nour was good at it. She knew how to build and she knew how to ask the kind of questions that made Soraya\u2019s glasses flash.\n\nThe evening after the duck incident, Nour arrived at class with a bruise on her temple from the Patrol and an apology ready for nothing in particular. Soraya looked up from the lab table where she was arranging hardware. \u201cYou look like you fought the underside of a car and the car won,\u201d she said cheerfully.\n\n\u201cIt was a draw,\u201d Nour said. She took her seat and let the classroom wrap itself around her with its familiar rattles and lights and stale air conditioning. On the whiteboard, Soraya had drawn a cylinder and an arrow and the words thrust and mass flow rate.\n\nSoraya tapped the diagram. \u201cWe spend a lot of time pretending rockets are magic. Call them what you like\u2014vehicles, ships, arrows\u2014but in the end they are machines obeying equations. They don\u2019t get to choose, and neither do we, mostly. But there is play.\u201d She grinned. \u201cTonight I\u2019m going to show you something a little stupid and a little glorious. Don\u2019t tell the dean.\u201d\n\nFrom her bag she produced a small thing the size of her forearm, smooth and white like something that had tried to be a fish and failed. It had fins like a dart. It looked like a toy if a toy had been asked to sit up straight and be serious. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do a static fire,\u201d she said. \u201cJust for a few seconds.\u201d\n\nThe room vibrated with that thrill that goes through people who have decided to believe in something. Nour felt other parts of herself settle. She forgot the duck as if it were a scene in a play she left at intermission. She asked, \u201cWhere?\u201d and Soraya wrinkled her nose.\n\n\u201cOut beyond the bypass. There\u2019s a place a friend uses for testing. Late. We won\u2019t tell anyone. Bring a fire extinguisher and your sense of joy.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot safe,\u201d someone muttered.\n\n\u201cSafety is a word that keeps our mothers sleeping,\u201d Soraya said. \u201cWe will bring a big extinguisher.\u201d\n\nAfter class, Nour stayed. She always did. She couldn\u2019t keep herself away from the feeling of being alone with a teacher, like being alone with a language. Scattered across the table were fins cut from aluminum, tube sections, wires, a laptop with numbers that meant something like spells. Soraya moved around the table, efficient. \u201cHow was your day?\u201d she asked, as if they were already friends.\n\n\u201cA bird came into the workshop,\u201d Nour said without meaning to. \u201cA duck.\u201d\n\nSoraya paused, turned, and blinked. For a moment she tried to put that picture into her real. Then she laughed softly. \u201cIt\u2019s too hot. Even the birds want air conditioning.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt panicked.\u201d Nour heard her own voice go thin and felt the warmth of embarrassment. \u201cI panicked.\u201d\n\nSoraya\u2019s laugh faded. Her face made a careful shape. \u201cSometimes panic finds you. If you make it a home, it will move in.\u201d\n\nNour nodded, because this seemed like wisdom, even as she wanted to roll her eyes at the structure of sentences that sounded like they belonged in a book. She wanted to say: No, I am not a person who collects panics. She looked at the parts on the table and thought: Make this, and the other thing will go away. She said, \u201cYou\u2019re building a rocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are building a rocket,\u201d Soraya said, and Nour felt the clean weight of the pronoun settle in her body. A line that tied the afternoon to the evening.\n\nThe first time she had ever held a piece of a rocket, she had been a girl with a dusty braid and greased palms, standing outside a warehouse where a man in a pale shirt had told her that space belonged to those with perfect math, and she had laughed in his face because she did not yet know that people were serious when they lied to you like that. She had liked the ring of the aluminum under her knuckles. She liked this ring too, now: the metal cool and pretending it would always be this cool. She liked that Soraya said \u201cwe.\u201d\n\nThey drove out past midnight, a convoy of two cars, and the city slid behind them like a curtain being pulled closed. The roads glittered with the currency of sodium lights. Nour sat in the passenger seat of Soraya\u2019s car with a fire extinguisher between her knees and a bag of bolts at her feet. Her phone showed messages from family going to bed and friends going out and a group chat sending fifty pictures of the same cat. She muted everything. Soraya hummed under her breath as if she were coaxing the road to be shorter.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Soraya said suddenly, like a confession, \u201cI wanted to be a dancer when I was little. An impossible thing. Or a baker.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wanted to be many things,\u201d said Nour. \u201cThat\u2019s heavy.\u201d\n\nSoraya smirked. \u201cI became an engineer by mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou love your mistake,\u201d Nour said without thinking.\n\nSoraya glanced at her swiftly, then returned her eyes to the road. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d\n\nOn the outskirts they turned onto a road that wasn\u2019t sure if it wanted to be asphalt or sand. Timbers lay scattered among scrub. In the distance, a cluster of industrial buildings squatted like patient animals. Soraya pulled into a gravel lot where someone had plunked down a rusting shipping container and a makeshift test stand built out of steel that had already learned to bake. A man with a baseball cap and a camel\u2019s patience lifted a hand in greeting. \u201cThis is Habib,\u201d Soraya said. \u201cHe is good. He is also very strict.\u201d\n\nHabib handed them a pair of ear protection muffs like a father handing children their shoes. He said little. He showed them the braces of the test stand, the mounts where the small engine would sit. He had a face lined the way dunes are lined. The stars above them felt close enough for instruments.\n\nNour helped. She lifted the small motor into place as if it were a holy thing. She tightened bolts, checked washers, clipped a safety line she would have written a love letter to if anyone were reading. Soraya\u2019s hair had escaped its clip and caught the moon. They moved like they had moved a hundred times, which they had not, but the body can pretend it remembers what it wants.\n\n\u201cReady,\u201d said Habib. \u201cWe\u2019re only going to light it for two seconds.\u201d He counted them as if they were coins.\n\nAt the ignition, the world preheated. The little engine answered and for a heartbeat Nour understood why people give up everything to make big engines answer. The sound cracked the night and the smell of burned propellant crawled into her lungs and got comfortable. It was small, ridiculous, and there was nowhere in the world she wanted to be more than there. She was laughing by the time it shut down, the kind of laugh that swallows itself. Soraya grabbed her shoulders and shook her and the three of them\u2014Habib too\u2014grinned like idiots.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Nour asked after the silence returned. \u201cWhy does this feel like washing your face in cold water when you didn\u2019t know you were tired?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause in this moment everything does what it is supposed to do,\u201d Soraya said, and then snorted at her own pretension. \u201cBecause we\u2019re boring and love obeyed equations.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you forgot the duck,\u201d said Nour, and then pressed a hand to her mouth like she\u2019d spoken a secret. Soraya looked at her with bright interest, the way you look at a specimen under a microscope and like it.\n\nThe fear slept for a night after that. Nour woke with a small bruise of joy under her sternum and a whisper in her pocket that said we we we. But fear is a careful animal, good at building nests in the part of the mind that collects receipts. It waits where it knows you will find it.\n\nA week later, a client asked her to come out to a private villa on Yas because his boat lift wasn't working, and when something breaks near water, people call the mechanic who thinks like an engine. Nour arrived at dusk, the air a humid fist. The villa faced a channel where water slid past quietly, and on the little terrace someone had set up sun chairs no one had ever used. The boat lift was broken by a simple thing: a control box with a corrosion problem and a wire that had given up. She could fix it with patience and the right tools. She had both.\n\nAs she knelt by the control box, a sound came from the water. The quiet quack of a duck like a polite throat clearing. She froze. It was nothing. It was behind her. She tried not to turn because not turning would make it less real, but then she had to turn because she is a person who looks at problems. There were three of them drifting near the lift, their backs glossy in the last light. They regarded her as if she belonged.\n\nIt is a ridiculous thing to feel trapped on a dock with water on three sides and a closed gate on the fourth. The laugh caught in her throat like a pill. She kept working because the worst thing in the world would be to explain to the client that she had to leave because of birds. Her hands found the wire again as if the wire had newly formed. The ducks came closer because that is what ducks do; they are curious about the interesting serious organism that moves like food. One of them gave a little huff-sound, not quite a quack, like someone clearing their nose. Nour\u2019s heart beat a drum pattern that made no sense. She tasted metal. She felt her hands become something not hers. They were not unreliable\u2014they were absurdly reliable\u2014fast and small and good, and yet everything in the middle of her chest tried to climb out.\n\nThe client came out, a man who apologized for his life just by standing. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s, uh, the birds,\u201d he said, half laughing and half apologizing for laughing. \u201cThey\u2019re a little\u2014my kids feed them. Are you okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Nour said, and it sounded like a different woman had borrowed her mouth. She finished the job. The boat lift whined then didn\u2019t, then moved like it remembered how. The client was grateful. On the way back to her car, her knees shook as if she had run. When she got inside, she put her forehead on the steering wheel and did not cry because crying would leave lubrication tracks she didn\u2019t want to polish.\n\nThis is how stories harden. Someone says a thing. Someone repeats it. Then a colleague uses the story as shorthand for complicated things and the shorthand becomes the thing you are.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t send Nour to Yas,\u201d Bassam said to Arif one morning without malice, only practicality. \u201cThey have birds.\u201d\n\n\u201cSend her to our clients who like rockets,\u201d said Arif, which was the kind of joke that ate its own tail because there were no such clients. Nour took the ribbing until it irritated her skin. She wished it rolled off. It didn\u2019t. It stayed. She went home tired and watched videos of mechanical watch movements to calm down, the tiny tilting of polished gears like an orderly little city.\n\nThat\u2019s when she started looking at the flyer near the elevator that she had ignored for months. The flyer\u2019s soft colors were so out of place in their building where everything was beige and functional: blue wave shapes, a pair of hands drawn in outline above a torso. Reiki sessions, the flyer said, with a phone number and a name: Mina.\n\nNour had always minded the distance between the leaf and the poem about the leaf. She had not been the kind to submit to the invisible. She loved acuity. She loved wrenches. And yet. The fear had chosen something ridiculous and made it a law. Maybe she could answer it with something ridiculous too. She put her thumb on the phone number and then took it off and then put it back again. She did not call. Not yet. She took the flyer down and folded it and put it in her pocket like contraband.\n\nAt class that night, Soraya talked about burn rates and wall thickness. She drew numbers with the chalk that slid too quickly, her fingers ending up white. \u201cWe can try to be clever,\u201d she said, \u201cand sometimes we should be clever. But there is an amount of aluminum per second that must turn into hot gas. You cannot argue with that.\u201d\n\nAfter class, Nour stayed. Soraya was packing her things and humming something that might have been Fairuz but could also have been a football chant. \u201cWe\u2019re sending the test article to Al Khatm soon,\u201d she said. \u201cBigger burn. Will you come? I need your hands. Habib is going to bring his friend who is even stricter than he is. I\u2019m afraid of his eyebrows.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come,\u201d said Nour. The words came out like a promise she would keep even if the sky let go of her. She wanted to be caught up in something larger than fear. She wanted her hands to find a place where they were not merely instruments but critical.\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d Soraya snapped her bag closed. \u201cDo you ever write your name on the inside of your skull? To remind yourself where you are.\u201d\n\nNour laughed. \u201cYou say the strangest sentences.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet your face tells me you know. Nour,\u201d she said, letting her name be the light in its meaning, \u201cI am asking you something not as your tutor, okay? As a person. Is something wrong?\u201d\n\nNour opened her mouth to say no. She grew up in a family where no was the default to all prying. But Soraya\u2019s eyebrows\u2014the very ones she claimed to fear in others\u2014were attentive in a way that made no jokes. Nour released a breath she hadn\u2019t known she\u2019d been editing. \u201cI\u2019m having a stupid fear. It keeps\u2026 showing up like commercials. Ducks,\u201d she said, hating the way the word sounded like it had been made in a toy factory. \u201cIt\u2019s new. It makes me feel like I have a loose screw in my brain.\u201d\n\nSoraya considered. \u201cMaybe a screw. Maybe not. You know, in space, we ask: what are the worst-case scenarios? And then we tell ourselves we will survive them. This is not space. This is the Corniche, okay. But the question is the same. What is the worst? You see a duck. You freeze. You leave. Your friends will laugh at you. They will laugh until something else comes to make them forget they laughed. All the same: the body is not convinced by arguments. The body wants another body to teach it peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean,\u201d Nour asked, cautious.\n\n\u201cIt means anything from breathing exercises to someone putting a hand over your heart and saying, \u2018Okay, shukran, calm.\u2019 I have a friend who believes in shaking. She shakes like a dog after a bath and then wants to eat ice cream. It works for her.\u201d\n\n\u201cI found a flyer,\u201d Nour admitted as if she were giving Soraya a small badly folded map. \u201cReiki. Energy healing. My aunt will laugh until she is a skeleton.\u201d\n\nSoraya\u2019s mouth curved. \u201cAunts. I love them. Call if you want. Don\u2019t call if you don\u2019t want. But if someone offers you kindness and a room with a chair and time to be quiet, take it, and someone else can be skeptical on your behalf.\u201d\n\nNour put the flyer on the table between them. Blue wave shapes. Her own name felt heavy and useful in her chest. She knocked her knuckles against the tabletop, the old mechanic\u2019s way of blessing a thing.\n\nThere were fewer quiet rooms in the days that followed than she had imagined. Fear, once given a name, often takes it as permission to forward its CV to other departments. Nour declined a job because it was next to a fountain in a mall. She didn\u2019t say why. She took a job in the heat that nobody else wanted. She came home with burns on her fingers from a radiator cap that bit her and she held her hands under the kitchen tap and thought of how fast water cooled metal and then of other kinds of heat that didn\u2019t obey the same rules. She went with her mother to a distant cousin\u2019s engagement party and performed joy with sincerity. She watched Soraya make a joke with her eyes during class when a boy asked a question with his whole chest and the wrong equation. She stood with Habib in a patch of dirt and counted down to another little roar that made her bones clink in place.\n\nOnce, in between, she called the number on the flyer. A voice answered, slightly breathless as if it had been running. \u201cThis is Mina,\u201d the voice said. \u201cYou are looking for what?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Nour said and sat down where she was in the stairwell so her legs would not give up. \u201cI have a stupid fear. I have a normal life and a stupid fear and I want to turn it off or make it small.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can come,\u201d Mina said. \u201cYou can tell me about the fear and also we can close our mouths and let it be. We will not make it larger by measuring it too many times. Are you free Saturday?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d said Nour, surprising herself. She gave the time a shape. She repeated it in her head like a part number.\n\nOn Friday, after prayer, her mother said, \u201cYour aunt called me. She said she saw you near the university at midnight.\u201d\n\nNour picked up a date from the plate and rolled it in her fingers, sticky as a new truth. \u201cI help my teacher. We are making a\u2014small rocket.\u201d Calling it small made it easier to put into the kitchen.\n\nHer mother gave the date a skeptical look as if it were an accomplice. \u201cYour teacher must be very interesting.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is. She is also bossy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd does this rocket take you away from this planet where you still have to get married? Does it carry your chores into the sky like a balloon?\u201d\n\nNour placed the date in her mouth so she would not say what her first sentence wanted to be. She chewed. She smiled. \u201cMaybe if it is big enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou dream like your father,\u201d her mother said. It was not a compliment and it was not not a compliment. \u201cThere is a mechanic who came to look at the washing machine. He had a nice face. He could not fix the washing machine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen he doesn\u2019t have a nice face,\u201d Nour said. Her mother pretended not to smile. They have this dance. They will dance it until someone changes the music.\n\nOn Saturday, Nour went to a small studio above a shop that sold candles that smelled like forest and sea and sometimes laundry. The studio was white and had a shelf of potted plants that were all the same fake green. There was a chair and a table and a tiny fountain in a corner that made a sound like someone was sighing in a happy way. Mina was a woman with a profile that could have been cut out of paper. She took Nour\u2019s hand the way you might pick a fruit you didn\u2019t want to bruise. \u201cYou can tell me or not tell me,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes telling is a way of not feeling.\u201d\n\nNour shrugged with one shoulder. \u201cDucks,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are everywhere.\u201d\n\nMina\u2019s smile was small and not performing. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will not argue with the ducks. Will you lie down?\u201d\n\nNour lay down on a table that smelled like eucalyptus and laundry. Mina put her hands over Nour\u2019s eyes without touching them and then over her chest and then over her knees. It felt like being measured by temperature instead of by numbers. It felt like the part of praying that is not words. Minutes passed slowly, oddly. Nour found herself laughing, not out loud. She saw the duck in the workshop as if it were printed on slow paper. She saw the way her hands were good and the way they had not abandoned her. She thought of Soraya lifting an engine with her eyes. She thought of Habib\u2019s hands, a quiet clock of a man, and how he had said nothing and said everything. She thought of aluminum. She thought of the sound of water in the little fountain and did not think: river. She did not think: quack.\n\nWhen it was over, Mina said, \u201cIt is not magic. It is breathing where you never breathed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like tools,\u201d Nour said. She felt foolish and cleaned. \u201cWill you be offended if I say I want to like this too but I am still a ridiculous woman who will go back to her bolts.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo back,\u201d said Mina. \u201c Bring your bolts. Maybe the hands can speak to each other.\u201d\n\nNour handed over money that felt like buying medicine. She walked down the stairs and out into the evening where the light was polishing the edges of buildings and the traffic stalled like a lazy animal. She sat in her car and did not put her forehead on the steering wheel. She looked at her hands on her thighs. She texted Soraya: Friday Al Khatm still happening? Habib\u2019s scary friend coming?\n\nSoraya responded with a rocket emoji and then an eyebrow.\n\nOn Thursday night, in the workshop, Bassam asked, as if he had to ask, \u201cSo. How are you and the ducks,\u201d and the way he said it, singing, made the word into something else, a container for a different song.\n\n\u201cBusy,\u201d Nour said, dry. \u201cWe have a new group chat.\u201d\n\nHe laughed, and in his laughter even the story had a different shape, something you could hang a coat on instead of a chain. Arif came out rubbing his hands like a man about to sell something and said, \u201cWe have a job next week for a boat engine at the marina. Not Yas. The small one. If you want it.\u201d\n\nShe waited for her body to revolt, to throw tractors in the road of her brain. It didn\u2019t. It hesitated like a car at a roundabout and then entered. \u201cI do.\u201d\n\nArif nodded as if this were not interesting. Maybe it wasn\u2019t. Maybe it was ordinary to everybody except the person who had to do the deciding.\n\nThat night, Nour packed the fire extinguisher into the trunk of her car as if it were a person she liked doing a dangerous job. She put a box of tools next to it, ritualizing, the way someone might set a glass of water on a bedside table not because they are thirsty but because they might be thirsty. She thought of the rocket in pieces finding itself, and of her hands being asked to sign their names on it. She thought of the ducks as a wind that had blown into her house and out again, although the door was still open and could open again.\n\nAlong the Corniche, the wind picked up. You could not see it, only the way it toyed with the fringe of a woman\u2019s shawl and the fronds of a palm. In the water, something like a fish but not a fish turned and left a gentle signature. Nour stood in the scrambling air between machines and animals and people and other words we have for ourselves. A prayer floated over the city in the last light like the idea of order. The workshop lights were hot. The city held its breath for the night to blow through it.\n\nThere would be a rocket. There would be the old men and the young men and the women who looked like them and nothing like them. There would be jokes. There would be heat. There would be something that smelled like burned sugar. There would be a duck one day and also a day with no ducks. There would be a time when she asked a stranger to trust the way her hands settled a bolt into the mouth of an impossible thing. And the story that had hardened\u2014duck girl\u2014would soften and drip and run, and under it another story would be found because there always is, because we are always not only one thing, because on a day when it is too hot for birds and engines, the wind coming off the Gulf will still insist on telling you it has news.3\n\nThe morning the shamal started, Abu Dhabi woke gritty. Dust had crawled under window frames and turned coffee tables into small deserts. Cars queued at gas stations wearing a thin suede of sand, and everyone\u2019s voice on the phone sounded as if it had been rolled in cloth. Nour wiped the sill in the kitchen with the edge of her palm and then wiped her palm on her jeans, which made both worse. Her mother clucked at the wind with the authority of a woman who had outstared weather her whole life, and shoved a glass of laban into Nour\u2019s hand as if hydration could be armor. A pan of onions hissed; the TV murmured the news in that barely rising tone it used when telling you the city was inconvenienced, not endangered. When the open balcony door banged once and then again, her mother banged back as if to say, we invented this ritual.\n\n\u201cAl Khatm?\u201d her mother asked, wrinkling her nose like someone tasting milk that had leaned toward sour. \u201cNow? In a wind like this?\u201d\n\nNour tied her hair with a band she kept on her wrist and felt the elastic snap the tender skin there, a sharp reminder that she was present. \u201cWe\u2019ll see when we get there,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it\u2019s too bad we won\u2019t light it. The man with the eyebrows will say no.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay God bless the eyebrows,\u201d her mother said dryly, and reached up to straighten the collar of Nour\u2019s shirt because straightening was love. \u201cCome back when your bones are all still inside and send me a message every hour like a teenager. Take dates. Habibi, your face gets thin when you are with your rockets.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy face is a rocket,\u201d Nour said, and kissed her mother\u2019s cheek. The kiss was a punctuation mark they both knew how to give their sentences. She picked up the backpack with tools and the extinguisher handle cut into her fingers in the familiar way that was better than prayer beads. She would worry about the marina job later. She said it to herself like a promise she didn\u2019t fully believe, which made it stronger.\n\nOut on the street, the shamal pushed at her like an old aunt insisting she take a second serving. Sand hissed along the asphalt and made the world into a photographic negative, all bleached edges and soft outlines. The city wore different cheekbones in this light. She drove slowly, past the mosque where the dates on the trees hung heavy and powdered with dust, past boys on bicycles with scarves wrapped bandit-style over their mouths, past a cat shaped like a small god slinking beneath a car. At a red light, she watched wind spoon grit against a concrete wall and thought of Habib, his patience sand-shaped. She thought of Soraya\u2019s text at dawn\u2014still on, bring masks\u2014and the way her own heart had tightened between excitement and the sigh of relief that would come if the wind cancelled their intentions. It is a strange thing when both outcomes feel like gifts.\n\nSoraya\u2019s car was a gray smudge in the parking lot behind the lab, the grayness more flattering than it ever was. She was loading the small composite body onto foam blocks in the trunk, her movements compact, her hair pulled into a knot that had decided to be messy and elegant at the same time. She looked up with squinty eyes and a grin that had to fight the wind. \u201cWe\u2019re going to arrive with twenty percent sand added to our mass fraction,\u201d she yelled over the shush. \u201cHabib said it\u2019s better in the interior. The city makes wind meaner.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you need help?\u201d Nour asked, though she was already there with her hands under the rocket\u2019s weight. They fitted together around the thing as if it were a child they were separate parents to. Soraya\u2019s knuckles knocked against hers and they both flinched as if burned, then pretended they hadn\u2019t, because pretending is one of the tools people use when they give each other space.\n\nThey drove like people who have decided to go somewhere even if the road doesn\u2019t want them. The highway out of the city lay like a ribbon that had been left out in a sandstorm overnight, smooth and scuffed. The city\u2019s edges fell away; warehouses became low groves of ghaf; beyond that, the desert opened like a book that had been thumbed until the spine cracked. The wind wrote wavy light over the dunes and erased it at the same time. In Soraya\u2019s car, the air conditioner fought a noble losing battle and songs played low enough to be background texture. When trucks passed them, they shed their own weather like tall ships.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Soraya said after a long silence that held its own companionship, \u201cmy mother used to put wet towels over the windows when I was little. In Damascus, in the summer, when the dust from the construction sites would drift like a complaint. She would make the house a cave. My sister and I would build rockets out of toilet paper rolls and tape and throw them from the balcony to the courtyard and our neighbor would shout up at us like an Egyptian soap opera uncle. He had a parrot who knew three swear words.\u201d\n\nNour smiled, the smile a little sideways because images of birds still walked through her mind like they owned it and here was a parrot, invited calmly into speech. \u201cDid your rockets land anywhere good?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were loyal to gravity,\u201d Soraya said. \u201cThey landed on the laundry lines. Once they landed on a plate of sliced watermelon and my mother said, okay, that\u2019s enough, you\u2019ve touched the sacred.\u201d The smile tilted away, and for a breath she looked forward with eyes that were not a teacher\u2019s eyes and not a friend\u2019s, just eyes watching a road in a country they had chosen. \u201cI want to make one that lands where I ask it to,\u201d she added in a tone that was both practical and the hunger you hear in someone telling the truth.\n\n\u201cThen you will,\u201d Nour said, because in her world promises were how machines learned to behave. She turned the words in her mouth like a bolt to make sure they fit.\n\nAl Khatm was less wind and more heat. The dunes gathered in loose courtyards and cupped the air in warmer palms; the noise of the shamal weakened as if the desert were a grandmother who had set a finger gently on its lips. A small cluster of vehicles hunkered around a shipping container and the test stand, and Habib stood in the raw shade talking with a man whose eyebrows offered a thesis in severity. He saw them and lifted his hand; the other man turned and lifted his eyebrows like a gate.\n\n\u201cThis is Farid,\u201d Soraya said, with the faint teasing of someone who knew what jokes they could make and which would cause explosions. \u201cHe keeps us honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI keep your insurance company happy,\u201d Farid corrected, and his voice was not unkind. It had the flat patience of someone who had told hundreds of people to slow down with dignity. \u201cGoggles, masks, protocol. Wind is lower. We proceed at discretion. We cut if it misbehaves.\u201d\n\nNour liked him immediately and disliked him too, the way you might like and dislike a torque wrench that had been calibrated too perfectly. He had a clipboard, and on it, a list where each line was a small law. He shook Nour\u2019s hand in a way that tested his hypothesis about her grip and nodded afterward as if she had confirmed it. \u201cYou\u2019re Nour,\u201d he said, and his eyebrows relaxed half a degree. \u201cHabib says you check three times and then you check again because checking is a religion. We need that religion in the desert.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need ear protection,\u201d Habib added, with his small smile like a shadow. \u201cAnd water. I left it in the shade.\u201d\n\nSoraya unloaded with the economy of someone whose hands remembered the sequence. Nour felt the familiar calm begin to pile its neat bricks inside her chest. The rocket section they had built sat in the cradle on the stand like an obedient creature, nose sunned, fins quiet. Cables coiled in loops that would satisfy a monk. The camera on its tripod peered like an old aunt trying to hear. The sky bleached and then blued, and the wind whispered secrets none of them spoke. Nour worked through the list: bolts seated, clamps torqued, lines connected, igniter continuity confirmed. Her fingers did their little checks like prayer, counting touches instead of beads. She called each item out for Habib and Habib answered in his murmuring tessellations. Soraya hovered at the laptop making jokes that were guise and code.\n\n\u201cTelemetry,\u201d Farid said, pointing at the screen with one long finger like a sentence. \u201cCall out before you light. Mask up. You will only run for three seconds. Three seconds is an eternity if you are wrong.\u201d\n\nNour put on the ear muffs and her world muffled into a polite, cottony thing. She pulled the mask up and the smell of her own breath, warm and faintly sweet from dates, enclosed her. Her heart found its rabbit rhythm and then slowed because her hands told it to. She liked the language of rockets because it was just another dialect of the language of cars. Both wanted to go somewhere. Both needed to be convinced they weren\u2019t being asked to die. She stepped back to the line and glanced at Soraya, who was looking at her, not at the numbers, her eyes bright under the brim of a cap she had stolen from Habib. For a second, Nour let herself receive that look as a blessing.\n\n\u201cRange,\u201d Farid called, eyebrows in their quiescent sternness. \u201cRange is clear. Last call.\u201d\n\n\u201cClear,\u201d said Habib.\n\n\u201cClear,\u201d said Soraya. \u201cLighting on my mark.\u201d\n\nThey counted together and the counting became something that belonged to them all. On two, the wind shifted and the smell of hot sand came like a hand held over the mouth of a stove. On three, the engine woke and a small pillar of insistence lifted dust and light. The sound went through Nour and rearranged the furniture. The camera blinked. The stand did its job with the smugness of something doing exactly what it was designed to do. In the small cracking roar, there was a line thrown out to every machine she had ever touched, and she wanted to cheer but remembered she liked to be quiet when joy was happening so she could watch it better.\n\n\u201cCut,\u201d Soraya called, and cut it, and the air snapped back like elastic. Silence carried the tiny hiss that came after, cooling metal making minute decisions. Farid lowered his eyebrows, which was his version of a grin. Habib nodded like a man at a well saying, yes, yes, the water is sweet today.\n\n\u201cAgain,\u201d Soraya said, looking to Farid and then to Habib and finally to Nour as if asking the three corners that kept her stupid glory standing. \u201cData looks good. Pressure within range. We can do another. We will be greedy and then we will go home.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will be careful,\u201d Farid said. \u201cGreedy later. You have a leak in an attitude line,\u201d he added after a blink, pointing to the screen, and his voice did not change and neither did his eyebrows. \u201cPressure decay too rapid for this temperature.\u201d\n\nIt was not a leak. It was a hairline crack in the fitting, the kind that a person with sorcerer eyes might catch or a person who had been taught by bolts. Nour saw it because her hunger for such errors had been trained like a falcon. The fitting sat in shadow, and when she touched it, it shivered under her finger like something that wanted to confess. She pointed; Habib angled the light; Soraya made a sound that was half curse, half praise for the world being the way it reveals itself. Farid\u2019s eyebrows did that small movement again. He said nothing about their greed, because now it looked like caution dressed as greed.\n\n\u201cWe switch it,\u201d Habib said. \u201cYou brought the spares.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always bring the spares,\u201d Nour said, and hearing herself say it steadied her as if she had set down a plate that had started to tilt. She walked to the car and the wind hit her, and the dunes performed their ancient dance and a bird lifted from behind the shipping container where it had been sheltering, startled into air by her presence. It was not a duck. It was a dove the color of old letters, its small head committed to a line through the gusts. Still, her chest made its mountain and its valley. She paused and felt her hands open and close around the spare fitting and thought, breathe where you never breathed. In the shadow stretched by the container there was no fountain, only her shadow moving with her. She returned and the work swallowed her.\n\nSwapping the fitting was a lesson in humility and in ratios. Metal wants not to be torn. Threads want to be reintroduced with courtesy. In the corner of Nour\u2019s mind where Mina had put a soft chair, a woman sat and watched and did not comment. In the corner where Soraya stored phrases that were dangerously close to poems, a sentence scratched its back on her ribs and settled down. Farid hovered without hovering. Habib gave her the wrench when she needed it without a word because work can be a prayer said by two.\n\nThey lit again and the engine made a small column of joy that widened at the top like breath. The roar crawled into bones and put its feet up. Farid actually smiled, which looked like a different man borrowing his face. Soraya whooped and then covered her mouth because she preferred to be inappropriate with intention. Nour let herself grin as openly as a child in the moment when a kite stops trying to escape and learns the game. She looked up at the sky and the sky was not impressed or unimpressed; it had its errands. She was not asking it for anything in that second; she was simply here with heat and noise and the facts.\n\nWhen the heat settled and the smell drifted, they sat in the strip of shade with their bottles of water and their long exhale. Habib munched on something that looked like sunflower seeds and distributed them like a sultan in a modest fairytale. Farid took a picture of the stand and then looked embarrassed at himself and put his phone away. Soraya stretched her legs and made an exclamation of delight that was purely about the joy of being unfolded. A fly tried to establish a friendship with Nour\u2019s ankle and she flicked it away with a minimal foot gesture that contained a small theater of disgust.\n\n\u201cTell me something boring about yourself,\u201d Soraya said suddenly, pushing her sunglasses up into her hair and squinting with interest. \u201cNot the thing about the ducks. I know the ducks. Something really boring, like a professional boring.\u201d\n\n\u201cI watch videos of watch escapements when I can\u2019t sleep,\u201d Nour said, and it felt like opening a drawer to show someone the exact shirt you fold the same way every time. \u201cThe little clicks and forks. It makes my brain smooth. You?\u201d\n\n\u201cI bake bread on Sundays and then forget to eat it until Wednesday,\u201d Soraya said, and her mouth tilted with an embarrassed pride. \u201cIt goes stale with patience. Then I make crumbs. The crumbs become cutlets. The cutlets become friends with a salad I never remember to buy. My life is an ecosystem of intent and improvisation.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike rockets,\u201d Farid inserted, surprising them all with the ease of his line, and Habib laughed softly and nodded as if approving a small improvement in the shape of the world.\n\nThe drive back felt shorter because they carried the weight of a small success like a piece of paper with a grade on it you want to show someone. The wind had tired. The city rose up ahead, scabbed with construction and shining in places as if it had put lotion on. Soraya tapped the steering wheel with her thumbs in a rhythm Nour recognized from her own feet when she walked a hallway and there was music only she could hear. They spoke about the data and they spoke about Mina and neither of them said the word that tugged at their sentences because it did not belong in the car, not that afternoon, not with dust in their noses and the engine running the way an engine runs when it is not choosing to break.\n\nAt home, her mother held up the dish cloth, her eyebrows the older cousins of Farid\u2019s. \u201cYou are still in one piece,\u201d she noted. \u201cGod is generous with fools.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were very clever fools,\u201d Nour said, and smiled when her mother swatted the air near her to claim a victory for parental warnings. She took a shower and watched the day\u2019s grit go down the drain and felt odd affection for the line of clean skin appearing under her fingers like truth revealed.\n\nIn the morning, the marina air was a different kind of breath. It had the sweetness of rot that all water keeps as a souvenir and the upnote of gasoline that always made Nour think of ferry rides in Ajman when she was a child and someone had sneaked them to feed chips to gulls. The light off the fiberglass of boats made a festivity of glare, the palms along the walk wore their combed look, and somewhere a speaker was playing a ballad that wanted to be louder. She parked, smiled at the attendant who had learned all the mechanics\u2019 names and called them \u201cboss,\u201d and shouldered her toolbox with a shrug that rearranged muscles in a way that told them work was what it was.\n\nThe engine belonged to a man who loved his weekends the way some men love their god. He had the fitted polo and the fitted belly; he had the sunglasses that said he was always judging the sea and always finding it adequately blue. He showed her the boat with the flourish of a host leading someone to a guest room and did not make a joke about ducks, and for that he earned an extra ounce of her compassion. The engine itself was not complicated. It was a stubborn thing, salt-bitten, with an impeller that had chewed its last and a thermostat housing that needed a new gasket because water and heat had eloped and left mess. She set to work with the memory of yesterday\u2019s heat still somewhere in her bones, a pleasant residue that made her quick and deliberate.\n\nOn the water, ducks were minds with paddles. They loafed and then translated themselves. There were two near the breakwater and three by a boat where a little boy in a striped shirt held out bits of bread like offerings to shrugging gods. Nour inhaled and her body made the old preparation to flee its own shape, and then she exhaled and felt the part of her that was Mina\u2019s client sit down again and place its hands on its knees. She looked at the ducks as if they were equations with known solutions, not the kind that became proofs you could fall into. She identified them: one glossy-headed, two the mottled brown of practical dresses. She did not look at their eyes. She looked at the bolts.\n\nHalfway through, the boy wandered closer because machines are magnets for certain children. He was careful not to step on ropes, which told her his father had taught him something, and he crouched near where Nour\u2019s tools lay and watched with the serious face of a person learning a secret. The ducks followed his path as if attached by string.\n\n\u201cMy baba says engines are like camels,\u201d he announced, not looking at her, looking at the place her hands entered the world and changed it. \u201cYou have to ask them please.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour baba is correct,\u201d Nour said, and didn\u2019t turn because turning would make the ducks into something with edges. \u201cIf you don\u2019t ask nicely, they spit.\u201d\n\nThe boy snorted. He held up his handful of bread and squinted. \u201cDo you like ducks?\u201d\n\nNour set the housing down, wiped her gloves on a rag, and considered the strip of water catching light like broken glass. She did not want to lie to a child, even a little. \u201cI like the way their feathers look like something a painter made. I don\u2019t like when they forget that I am not bread.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should tell them,\u201d he said with the confidence of seven. \u201cMy mother tells me and I remember.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe you can tell them for me,\u201d she said, and that felt like the kind of asking for help she was learning how not to be ashamed of. \u201cTell them this woman is a mechanic. Tell them her fingers are not bread.\u201d\n\nHe marched to the edge of the dock and, with the authority of someone who has never doubted that animals listen, addressed the ducks. He used a voice with the cadence of his father\u2019s prayer and his teacher\u2019s reprimands and his cartoons\u2019 commands. The ducks backed away a little, confused by the sudden thunder. He returned, pleased, and examined her ratchet as if it were a pet. \u201cWhat does this do,\u201d he asked, and she showed him, and for a while the world contained only the click of gears and the way tiny complicated things turn when you ask them to.\n\nWhen the engine finally coughed and decided to live, the man in the sunglasses made the little boyish sound all men make when a machine agrees to belong to them. He tipped Nour extravagantly and then tried to tip her again when she refused the extravagance with polite gratitude. On the walk back to the parking lot, a duck crossed her path with the deliberation of a person who knows the rules of the street. Nour stopped, and the duck stopped, and they regarded one another like distant cousins at a wedding. She felt the old ridiculous trembling begin, and she felt the newer thing rise to meet it, the one that was a part held for her by other hands. It was not courtly peace and it was not war. It was an armistice signed in pencil.\n\nAt the workshop that afternoon, the air had decided to be thick rather than hot, the way a stew is thick rather than watery. Bassam had a headache and wore it like a hat. Arif argued with a supplier on the phone and hung up with a resigned flourish, the kind of flourish that says real victory is a myth. A man brought in a Land Cruiser that complained loudly and would not explain why. Nour\u2019s mother sent her a link to a photo of a cat with eyebrows. Soraya sent an image from the data run circled in red\u2014the kind of circle that says look, look, we did math and it listened. Mina texted her a single blue wave and Nour answered with a single wrench and then shook her head at herself before she liked that she had done it.\n\nIn the evening, the elevator surprised them by stopping at the correct floor and Nour\u2019s mother exclaimed as if the building had stamped her paper after making her wait in line for hours. There was fish for dinner, baked with lemons that had grown in someone else\u2019s yard. The news on TV was a parade of ministers visiting places and men in suits saying sentences that sounded as if they had been ironed. A neighbor knocked to ask for sugar and stayed to discuss the sudden rise in the price of the better kind of rice. After dishes, her mother said, in a tone that wanted to be casual and could not quite manage it, \u201cThere is a nice man, the cousin of the woman from our building whose daughter got into engineering. He is an engineer too. Electrical. He did a training in Germany. He visits his mother every Friday. We are invited tomorrow for tea. It is only tea. You can say no.\u201d\n\nNour carved a line in the condensation of her glass with her fingernail and watched the water reunite with itself. Somewhere inside her the duck tilted its head. Somewhere inside her the rocket counted down. \u201cTea is tea,\u201d she said, and smiled politely at the air. \u201cWe will go and obey the tea.\u201d\n\nHer mother nodded, both relieved and immediately pensive about her outfit. They sat together on the small balcony that looked over other small balconies and listened to the city unlace its day. A tangle of boys shouted about a goal in the dusty lot where they had painted a penalty line in their minds. The mosque sent its evening call out like a hand searching for a familiar shoulder. A woman watered a plant that had decided to live after dying three times. The wind had laid down, tired. In that peace, Nour thought about what she had chosen: to drag the ridiculous fear into rooms with rockets and men with eyebrows and little boys with striped shirts and a woman who placed her hands above her ribs and told her nothing and everything. She thought about being someone\u2019s wife, about the slimness of her knowledge of it, about the way work made a shape around her that she fit into and the way love might be a city she did not yet have the maps for.\n\nWhen she slept, she dreamed she was lying under the belly of the sky as if it were a car, the stars arranged like bolts at regular intervals, their heads shining. She reached up with her spanner and found each one and pressed, and in the quiet there was a flapping, but it was only her own breath moving through her, a kind of wing she had been carrying since she was born. In the dream, Soraya counted softly, and Habib said nothing, and Farid\u2019s eyebrows knit and unknit like an old woman\u2019s hands and Mina\u2019s palms hovered an inch above the dream of her heart, warming it without touching.\n\nThe next day the nice engineer with the Germany certificate had soft hands and a laugh that did not know it was trying to impress people. He asked her what she did and she said the words she always said and watched the small alarm cross his face and leave, like a bird realizing it had flown into the wrong room. He talked about voltage; he talked about trains. He did not ask about ducks. He did not make her feel like the wrong bolt for a thread. Her mother watched from the kitchen like a director who wanted a particular scene and was trying not to interfere with the actors. Nour drank tea, she offered dates, she made the correct jokes at the correct times, and she felt like she had cleaned out a drawer and stacked its contents in tidy rows even if she did not know yet where the drawer would go.\n\nAfter they left, after her aunt called to perform the autopsy of the tea with an enthusiasm unmatched by any doctor, after the dishes had been put away and the night done its slow tide thing, Nour sat at the small table with the form for a certification course open on her laptop. It would give her an extra stamp on her competence. It would cost money she could find. It would happen on Tuesday evenings when Soraya\u2019s class did not. She filled in her name with a small anxious pleasure, like aligning a bearing to a shaft and feeling it slide with that perfect, almost obscene smoothness. She sent the application into the night and leaned back and closed her eyes.\n\nA wingbeat sounded outside the window, and her body startled before her mind. She stood and opened the curtain with her fingers in that careful way she had learned from both rockets and reiki, mindful of not ripping the world. On the railing was no duck and no dove. There was a bulbul, stuttering its delicate call, head cocked, tail flicking like punctuation. It stared at its own reflection in the glass and decided to be brave. Nour watched it, and the watching did not carve her, and when it flew away, its absence was not a hole but a reminder that air knows how to hold what passes through it.\n\nLater, when she texted Soraya about the certification, the answer came swift. Proud of you, the message said, and then, as if the truth had slipped out and decided to stay, I like how your hands think. She stared at the words until their shape became just pixels and then back into words again. She wrote, We are going to need a better fitting for the oxidizer line, and she wrote, The ducks have a spokesperson now who is seven and very bossy, and she wrote, I will bring bread on Sunday if you make it and forget to eat it. She did not send all of these. She sent the first one, and then a minute later, the second, and left the third to sit in her drafts like a spare part she would keep in the box for now.\n\nAt dawn, the city polished its sky with pink and somebody\u2019s radio played a song about return. Nour woke before the alarm with a sentence in her chest that felt like a tool she hadn\u2019t used yet and would need. She did not know what job it would fit. She only knew it had weight and balance and that when she reached for it, it would be there. Outside, a boy on a bicycle cut a shadow across the streetlights going off in sequence, and the day rolled its shoulders as if about to lift something heavy and precious, knowing it could.By the time the certification class began to feel like a room she had always been entering, Nour had learned where the cold settled in the building and where the tea man left the paper cups when he was in a forgiving mood. The classroom was different from the lab with Soraya and different again from the workshop; it wore seriousness like a badge, posters laminated and slightly peeling at the corners instructing proper safety protocols with images of generic men in goggles. Most of the people were men who wore their competence on their shoulders and checked their phones under the table as if their thumbs were permitted to attend two classes at once. The instructor was a woman with hair that had given up being dyed and was magnificent in its decision, a braid thick as rope that she looped around itself like a knot in a dock line. Her name was Laila and she had worked in places Nour imagined in black and white: oil fields that smelled like banknotes, hangars where the roofs hummed with heat. She spoke without asking to be allowed, and when she said the word torque it seemed to land on the table with a satisfying weight.\n\n\u201cYour hands will save your life if your brain is lazy,\u201d she told them in a voice that was amused and grim at once. \u201cYour brain will save your job if your hands want to show off. It is a marriage. Let them counsel each other.\u201d She walked through the room and corrected a grip here, a posture there, and when she stopped by Nour, she nodded at the way Nour held the micrometer. \u201cWho taught you that,\u201d Laila asked softly, and when Nour said, \u201cBolts,\u201d Laila grinned and moved on. In the break, a young man with a shaved head asked Nour if she was the one from the workshop on M-15 that everyone said could \u201chear\u201d a battery drain. She shrugged like a person making nothing out of a small miracle and did not give him the story he wanted. Later, Laila pulled her aside with the ease of someone sliding a screwdriver under a lid. \u201cThe men will think you are a new tool,\u201d she said without pity, only accuracy. \u201cLet them. Tools are useful. Be a useful tool until you are a machine they depend on and cannot name.\u201d\n\nThe workshop felt heavier that week, not with heat\u2014though heat was always a cousin in the room\u2014but with work that wanted to be done and was not interested in narratives. A fleet order had come in from a construction company with half its pickups vibrating wrong and the other half complaining in languages Bassam could not translate. Arif stood in the office doorway and rubbed the back of his neck with the hand he used for numbers, the gesture of a man who would not lie down even when tired. In the rafters, something soft and insistent had made a home; they could hear the low coo and the flutter like folded paper trying to become kite again. \u201cPigeon,\u201d Bassam pronounced, peering upward with the confidence of a naturalist of roofs. \u201cShe thinks this is a tree.\u201d\n\nArif made a noise that was not quite a sigh and not quite a laugh. \u201cWe will charge rent.\u201d He sent the smallest of the apprentices up the ladder with a broom and a box like a man offering a boy a birthday party, and the boy grinned and scrambled, but then hesitated as the pigeon flapped and he wobbled and the ladder rocked and everyone got a little older in an instant.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Nour said, already moving without remembering she had made a decision. The ladder had its own language, the squeak and the slide, and the rafters smelled like dust and the sugar of old heat. The pigeon watched her with that bead eye that felt like the world looking in on itself and made a small sound that wasn\u2019t a quack and wasn\u2019t anything dangerous, just a reminder that small hearts hit their walls very quickly. Nour breathed in the way Mina had told her\u2014under the ribs and then wider than the ribs\u2014and made her body a slow animal. \u201cOkay,\u201d she murmured, as if she were an aunt and the pigeon a toddler messing with the remote. \u201cWe are both intruders, yes? No one will peck anyone\u2019s eyes.\u201d She slid the box close, used the broom to suggest directions with politeness, and in the end lifted the small messy nest with the gentleness of someone carrying a plate of fragile sweets across a crowded room. On the ground, Arif had a plastic crate, and they moved the whole situation to a ledge outside where the pigeon blinked at the sun and reorganized her outrage. Bassam clapped and declared her Queen of Birds for a day, and Nour let him and didn\u2019t mind because her hands had done something they hadn\u2019t done before without shaking, and that was the crown she wanted.\n\nSoraya stole an hour between her work and their class to send Nour a picture of bread that looked like it had fallen asleep on the counter while pretending it was a moon. \u201cI remembered to eat two slices,\u201d she typed, and added three knife emojis in a row as if punctuation could cut the loaf. In class, they fussed over a guidance board that refused to be polite to the environment it had been introduced to, and Soraya swore under her breath in Arabic and French and then apologized to the board as if the components had ears. \u201cWe have two weeks,\u201d she said, tapping the spreadsheet with the offended love you give to a toddler who will not get in the car. \u201cTwo weeks before the people in Al Ain who can give us money and dignity want a demonstration. Not a flight. A tethered tantrum that looks like grace. Habib says yes if the eyebrows say yes.\u201d\n\nFarid\u2019s eyebrows were more persuasive in text than in person; he sent a list that read like a short story about catastrophe and how to avoid becoming its main character. Nour printed it out and taped it to the lab wall and to the inside of her own skull, where she already kept lists: bolts and gaskets and birthdays and the time she should leave if she wanted to arrive without greed. She and Soraya stayed an hour too long that night, soldering in a world that had shrunk to points of light and the occasional squeak of chair legs on linoleum. When they finally turned off the room, it felt like closing the eyes of a sleeping thing.\n\nMina\u2019s studio had learned her shape now, which was not magic but was something; the second visit had fewer introductions, fewer jokes in her head about being an unreligious person in a soft church. Mina kept the fountain on low and the fan on a lower speed and asked fewer questions. \u201cI want you to tell me one thing you like about what happens in your body when you are afraid,\u201d she said, as if that were a normal sentence and the world not full of people who hated their fear entire.\n\nNour startled and then snorted, because the cheeky part of her liked being asked to praise an enemy. \u201cI like that I can feel every door out of a room,\u201d she said, and it was true; fear made architects of cowards. \u201cI like that it sharpens my sight even when I don\u2019t want it to.\u201d\n\nMina nodded as if Nour had offered a new spice to her kitchen. \u201cThen we will feed those parts first,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will not starve fear. We will ask it to sit in a different chair.\u201d\n\nThey did not go to the mangroves. They went only as far as the fountain in the mall with the fake rocks and the real children. Ducks did not go to malls to pretend to be rich; they had better taste. But there were videos of ducks on the phones of three people within five meters, and when a screen lit up in Nour\u2019s peripheral vision with the familiar bobbing foolishness and a caption that read \u201cthis guy is me,\u201d she felt the old flicker and the new practice and put her hand on her own thigh, pressure enough to remind the thigh it was attached to a person. Mina watched her without being an observer; it was a trick of hers. \u201cWhat do you smell,\u201d she asked, and Nour said, \u201cCinnamon, grease, perfume that doesn\u2019t know when to stop.\u201d \u201cWhat do you hear,\u201d Mina asked, and Nour said, \u201cThe fountain, a child complaining about onions, the clicking of a sandal that is about to break.\u201d \u201cWhat do you know,\u201d Mina asked finally, and Nour said, surprising herself with how easily it came, \u201cI know I am in a mall and it is absurd and I am a woman with bolts in her bag and this is not a river.\u201d When they left, the sunset over the highway had decided to perform for the city as if the highway deserved a show, and Mina put her hand briefly on Nour\u2019s shoulder, a soft, precise press, and said, \u201cYou will have to choose a ritual before you see a duck. Choose it now so your body doesn\u2019t make a bad one for you.\u201d\n\nThe tea with the nice engineer was almost good, which is worse in some ways than a disaster because it invites hope to sit down on the sofa and make plans. His name was Kareem and he had a smile that showed he had taught himself to use it kindly, and he asked her questions about her work that were not prying, and when her mother told a joke that made fun of herself, he laughed with her, not at her. He had opinions that were sturdy and not exhausting. He did not flinch when she said \u201cengine\u201d and \u201cgrease.\u201d He did not try to make himself taller by pressing his thumb on someone else\u2019s head. But when he mentioned, smoothly, as if he were placing a teaspoon on a saucer, that one day perhaps she would prefer something \u201ccleaner,\u201d an office with chairs that had opinions about your back and emails that multiplied like polite bacteria, the inside of her went cold the way steel does when you drench it too quickly. She nodded and listened to his story about Germany, about efficient trains and neat trash, and she smiled in the correct places, and her mother watched with the hopeful terror of mothers who would like their daughters to be both rocket and dock.\n\nAfter they left, her mother said nothing for a while and then said everything with her hands, rearranging the fruit in the bowl and turning the television to a cooking show as if recipes could be a conversation about marriage. \u201cHe was nice,\u201d Nour offered, because it was true and because the truth is sometimes a small coin you can hand to someone you love without opening the entire purse. \u201cHe didn\u2019t talk with his elbows.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is nice,\u201d her mother agreed, and then added, because she could not help herself, \u201cHe will want someone who is home on Friday afternoons to make the good rice.\u201d Nour did not say anything. She did not want to open a future on the table and cut it in half while her mother watched. She went to her room and stared at the form she had sent for the certification and felt the quiet hum of her own choosing and it steadied her in the way a good tool steadies a hand when the screw starts to strip.\n\nAt the lab, the tether looked like a leash on a creature that would pretend to hate leashes and secretly be grateful for them. They had bought braided straps rated for more force than this small body would ever think itself capable of, and Farid had checked their anchors and then checked the ground around the anchors as if he could check the desert itself for loyalty. Habib had brought a friend named Maryam who was not frightened by anything human beings made; she had been a firefighter and took the extinguisher from Nour\u2019s hands and showed her two new ways to hold it and three ways to think about its mouth. \u201cIt is a promise you can only keep once,\u201d Maryam said, patting the red cylinder with affection. \u201cMake it a good promise.\u201d When the first tethered burn rattled the strap and strained against its own boundary and then settled and let itself be joy inside limits, Soraya made a noise that was very nearly a sob and then turned it into a cough and then into a laugh, and Nour watched the numbers and the strap and the sand and felt something in her chest remembered from being a child on a swing, the precise moment the chain stopped feeling like gravity and started feeling like air.\n\nIn the second run, a dust devil came like the hand of an impatient god, a twisting column that wrote and erased its name across thirty meters of nothing. It passed behind the stand a heartbeat before the ignition, and Nour saw it in the corner of her eye and did not think so much as lean, the body a lever, two fingers on Soraya\u2019s wrist like a conductor stalling a symphony for a cough. \u201cWait,\u201d she said into the muffling of her muffs, her mouth dry, and Farid\u2019s eyebrows caught the movement on the edge of his own attention and he put his hand flat like a teacher suggesting stillness to a class that wanted to explode. The dust devil walked on, bored, spun out its skirts, and fell apart in dignified chunks. \u201cNow,\u201d Farid said, and nobody called her cautious in a way that meant coward later because everyone had seen the near and the far for what they were. Afterward, in the shade that was never enough shade, Habib handed Nour a piece of dried apricot and said, \u201cGood,\u201d and that was a sentence that could stretch across years and not break.\n\nArif watched her with a look that did not belong to any single emotion when she told him about Al Ain. A part of him admired a thing done well even if it did not bring him invoices paid, and a part of him remembered the boys he had hired who had turned themselves into songs and left and a part of him counted the hours she would not be there to coax bad alternators into being civilized. \u201cYou tell me the days,\u201d he said, as if she were asking him to carry a couch down three flights of stairs with her and he had already started walking. \u201cWe\u2019ll manage. Tell Bassam to stop volunteering your name to every boat with a bird in its background. I will strangle him if he jokes again when it is not funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes it is funny,\u201d she said, because she didn\u2019t want to be unfair to laughter, even when it had bitten her. He rolled his eyes with affection and pretended to refuse to agree.\n\nThe Thursday before Al Ain, Soraya showed up at the workshop door like a wrong part delivered to the right address. She took in the racks of oil and the men glancing at her as if a comet had streaked through their weather and lifted a hand as if to introduce herself to a church. \u201cI\u2019m stealing her,\u201d she told Arif, and Arif did the thing where he pretended he was being mugged and then handed over his wallet with flourish. She sat on an upturned crate while Nour finished with a stubborn belt, her legs long and crossed at the ankle, her face without its practiced lab authority. \u201cI am more afraid than I look,\u201d she admitted, and the admission did not make her smaller, it made her honest. \u201cWhen I was little, I used to hold my mother\u2019s hand crossing the street and I could feel her pulse and I thought it was the city\u2019s pulse and I felt safe because the city was alive. Today I put my hand on my own shoulder and tell it, yes, yes, we are alive and it is enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sound like Mina,\u201d Nour said without mocking, and Soraya laughed and threw her head back in a way that made Bassam drop a wrench because he forgot gravity required him to hold it.\n\nThat evening, when she stopped by Mina\u2019s because anxiety had pecked holes in her schedule and she needed a place to sit where no one asked for anything except air, Mina showed her a silly thing that worked. \u201cChoose a word not for meaning but for feel,\u201d she instructed, tapping her own bottom lip with a finger like a metronome. \u201cChoose a word your mouth likes to make, and put it in your mouth when fear tries to put its own.\u201d Nour tried on several and rejected them because they were too heavy or too clever or too stuck to other stories. She stopped on the word \u201csmooth,\u201d not because her life was smooth but because her tongue understood it and the teeth did not have to argue with it. She said it softly and it made her lips round and then relax, a small muscle apology to an entire system.\n\nThe demonstration at Al Ain was a small circus pretending to be a conference. There were tents and snacks and men with lanyards that made them straighten their backs as if the rectangles around their necks weighed five kilos each. There were women in abayas with shoes that could kill bugs. There were teenagers craning their whole bodies toward the glitter of any thing that sparked. There were men who took pictures of everything including their own feet. The tethered test bed was a modest square in a corner of the field that had been sectioned away from everything else with tape like a crime scene. Farid\u2019s eyebrows were tense with purpose; Habib had a clipboard because sometimes religion needed props; Maryam had a radio and a glare that made teenagers reconsider being entertaining in her vicinity. Soraya wore a cap and a grin that started in something like joy and ended in something like, if you don\u2019t behave I will make you behave.\n\nNour liked the ritual of it, the checking of cords and switches, the way numbers warmed up as if they were sleepy animals. She liked the way her name got called out for tasks that were now hers because they were her size. She liked the way a little girl in a yellow dress watched with her entire skeleton and tugged her father\u2019s sleeve and hissed, \u201cShe,\u201d to make sure he properly recorded the fact of a woman in the center of the tape. When they lit and the engine\u2019s roar diluted itself with the crowd\u2019s noise and the tether thrummed and the stand consented to stay intact and the announcer in a different tent tried to make a joke and failed, Nour stood inside her own hearing and listened. It was not the same as the desert. It was not family. But it was a cousin. It was proof. It was obeyed equations and it was the messy part of joy you cannot graph.\n\nAfter, when the official with a tie shook Soraya\u2019s hand too long and then shook Farid\u2019s briefly and then forgot to shake Nour\u2019s at all, Soraya reached back and took Nour\u2019s wrist and pulled it forward into the handshake like a magician correcting a card trick and made the official look her in the face. His eyes did the thing many men\u2019s eyes do when asked to reckon with the gap between where they thought the axis lay and where it actually does; then he smiled with his teeth and said blunted compliments with adjectives that rolled around as if they were the wrong size. Nour smiled back with her teeth because she had learned to do that and because his opinion was not a wrench she needed.\n\nThey drove back with the smell of dust and popcorn in their hair and ate bread with labneh in the parking lot like teenagers avoiding their own parents. Soraya said she wanted to take the tether off and Nour said she wanted to do it in the desert and Farid said he would rather write five more lists and Habib said quietly, which always carried more weight than shouting, \u201cWe will live longer if we pretend to be patient.\u201d Nour sat on the hood of her car and let the metal warm her through her jeans and thought of the marina, of the boy in the striped shirt who believed in her ministry to ducks and motors, of her mother\u2019s scanning of Kareem\u2019s answers for signs of a man who would take care of a woman who already took care of herself.\n\nOn the Sunday morning after Al Ain, she went to the Corniche on purpose. The sky pressed itself against the water as if trying to see its own pores. Men ran in circles to prove things to themselves and to convince their watches they were not liars. Women negotiated strollers and small negotiations with smaller people. She wore sunglasses and a cap and carried nothing in her hands, a decision that felt bare and right. She sat on a low wall and made her body a slow animal and watched the ducks watch the world. The ritual she had chosen\u2014thumb pressed into the meat of her palm, the silent word smooth moving through her mouth without leaving crumbs\u2014stayed with her like a friend you can take to a party because he will not make you babysit him. The ducks were ducking; one flicked water off its back with a satisfaction no human gets from any shower. One slept standing on a leg, a trick she envied. A child nearby dropped his ice cream, an honest tragedy. Nour felt the breath spike and settle, like a car that revs and remembers it is in a parking lot. She did not stand or leave. She let the fact of them be a piece of the day\u2019s furniture and she was a different piece and nothing about the room needed to be rearranged.\n\nWhen she went home, her mother caught her by the elbow and held her there as if she were checking the tightness of a bolt without tools. \u201cI did not marry off your sister before I was ready,\u201d she said, apropos of nothing and everything. \u201cI am not marrying you off to anyone. Do you hear me.\u201d Nour blinked, startled by the sudden rearranging of furniture in that room. Her mother put her hand on Nour\u2019s cheek as if it were an instrument she could calibrate. \u201cI want you to ask for what you want and be ready to give it up at the same time. This is how we do not break. I do not know how to teach you this and still sleep. So you will teach me. You will tell me when you cannot be in a kitchen on a Friday and I will save you food for Saturday and not make a face. You will bring me your rockets like dates in a box and I will take one and pretend I am not hungry for the whole thing.\u201d\n\nNour laughed then, the laugh that curls into itself, because this was love in her family: bargaining with tenderness, eyes that know but do not say they know. She hugged her mother and felt, for a moment, like a girl again with a skinned knee and an impossible math problem and a father who would kiss the top of her head and tell her a story about carburetors and marriages in the same breath. She had not thought of him in weeks in the way that felt like a sin and also like survival. The memory came with the smell of cigarettes and jasmine and a pair of hands that had built a bookshelf crooked and called it modern.\n\nThat night, a message arrived from Kareem, careful and polite. He asked if she wanted to see a documentary about trains on Thursday and then added, as if laying down a soft rug between them, that if she had rockets on Thursday, he would be glad to go another time. She typed three answers and deleted two and left the third, which was yes, and then the fourth, which was maybe, because she did not yet know if the desert would call her name that night. Her phone chimed again, Soraya asking if she could borrow a specific torque wrench because \u201cFarid does not trust the lab\u2019s and neither do I and Maryam will judge me if the bolt glances at me wrong,\u201d and she chimed back, yes, and then added, \u201cI sat with actual ducks. My word was smooth.\u201d\n\nSoraya replied with a duck emoji and then a sentence that did not pretend to be casual. \u201cI am glad you choose to stay,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn rooms. In yourself. In the work. It makes the work better.\u201d Nour put the phone down and lay on her bed and stared at the ceiling where the blades of the fan had learned to balance a slight wobble with the dignity of an elder. She thought about how much choosing there was in even a small day in a city that pretended to be a machine and was actually a collection of animals pretending not to be animals. She thought about the desert\u2019s patience and Al Ain\u2019s tape and her mother\u2019s bargains and Mina\u2019s words and Laila\u2019s hands and Habib\u2019s yes and Farid\u2019s lists and Soraya\u2019s mouth when she smiled like a woman who might one day look at a thing she made and be held by it instead of the other way round.\n\nIn the week that followed, life did the thing it does when you are looking in another direction: it added small emergencies like spices to a dish you were already trying to keep from boiling over. An old client arrived with a radiator that had decided to quit in the middle of the Abu Dhabi\u2013Dubai road and had to be coddled into remembering the concept of water. A delivery was late. A cousin sent a voice note crying because her boss had yelled at her in front of everyone and Nour sent back the only kind of voice note there is for that, which is one where you say words like \u201cyou are not a child\u201d and \u201cyour work is not your worth\u201d and also \u201cbring me his brake pads and I will make them squeal for a month.\u201d At night, she tuned the tiny escapements of watch videos and let their clicks be proof that order was not a superstition. In the morning, she bought extra bread and didn\u2019t tell Soraya she was going to forget to eat it, she simply left it wrapped on the lab table and drew a face on the paper bag with two dots and a line so it could pretend to be a person and keep Soraya company when she wasn\u2019t there.\n\nOn Thursday, she stood in the lab doorway with the torque wrench in her hand and a text from Kareem on her phone and the sound of the world negotiating with itself in the hallway and realized she could hold two things in a hand when she\u2019d been taught it was only a handle. She placed the wrench on the table and told Soraya to bring it back with her life intact. She told Kareem she would arrive to the film late and leave early. She told herself she would go to the Corniche on Friday after prayer and sit with the people who fed birds against the advice of signs and she would not feed them because the signs were right and she wanted to learn a different kind of mercy. She walked into her day with her hands ready, and inside her the word smooth warmed and cooled like breath.The week after Al Ain began with the kind of heat that seemed less like temperature and more like a decision. It sank early into the day and did not do the courtesy of lifting at sunset, as if the city had signed a contract with summer and was bound to honor it even when everyone whispered about breaking the terms. At the workshop, fans clicked and hummed without changing anything important. Bassam wore a damp towel under his cap and drank water like he\u2019d been paid to set an example. Arif stood at the parts counter and squinted at a spreadsheet as if it had personally offended him. The pigeons who had tried to lease the rafters held their meetings outside now and made loud opinions at intervals as if to say, this arrangement is substandard. Nour moved through the day with a slightly different weight in her arms, a residue of Al Ain\u2019s tether and the particular way it vibrated in her bones when joy was constrained and behaved. The certification sessions with Laila had knocked a burr off her mind; her grip had changed by a degree that meant faster work without hurrying. When Laila paused by her bench during a practice assessment and murmured, \u201cYou are not doing more, you are doing less cleanly,\u201d Nour felt the small click inside that meant a part had found its seat. She went home in the evenings and every so often touching the inside of her palm, that pressure point Mina had taught her, as if it were a tiny light switch she could flick without anyone seeing.\n\nThe rocket\u2019s next steps appeared on Soraya\u2019s whiteboard as if they had walked in on their own. They were numbers and arrows and a list that started tame and became ambitious halfway down, like someone writing a note to a friend and remembering midway the thing they wanted to ask for that felt impossible. They needed a better regulator for the oxidizer line and a set of quick-release clamps that had to be a certain grade because anything lower would become shrapnel at precisely the wrong moment. The clamps were not in the country and the regulator was, allegedly, inside a warehouse in Mussafah whose address had been recorded in a language that did not desire to be read. Soraya made phone calls and spoke in the voice she used for bureaucrats, which was friendly to your face and disassembling your arguments at the same time. Habib said he had a cousin who knew a man who could bend metal to order if you brought coffee that tasted like the old days. Farid, with his eyebrows like punctuation marks you only used when you were serious, sent them a PDF of alternatives that would not insult the laws of physics. In all of it, Nour found herself becoming the person you let hold a piece while you argued what the piece should be. She went with Habib to a shop tucked behind two others where an old man with hands that had been apprenticed to files before machines were trusted considered their sketch and said, \u201cThis wants to be steel, not aluminum. Aluminum gets dreamy in heat. Steel knows who it is.\u201d He said it without romance, like a man looking at an old friend who had become more himself with age. They watched him cut and polish, the motion slow enough that you could have taken a nap in it and woken to find a perfect circle of work done. Nour liked the smell of ground steel and the patience that lived in that room; it felt like entering a small mosque and being allowed to sit without knowing the words.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Soraya texted her as if admissible panic came with a specific ringtone. The message was a photograph of her own face in the reflective glass of a university office and the caption, \u201cI have to perform competence to a man who thinks rockets are an expensive way to tell men they matter.\u201d Nour put down the alternator she was pretending to be interested in and asked Arif without asking to leave for an hour. The admin building had its own microclimate of air-conditioning and ambition. Upstairs, a dean with neat hair smiled like a tourist who had been promised a rare animal and was now being shown a cat. He liked the optics of innovation, he said; he liked the word pipeline; he liked beginnings he could stand near during photo sessions. Soraya stood very straight and did not flinch when he suggested they invite a sponsor who wanted to put their name on something vertical. \u201cWe need the regulator and the quick-release clamps, and we need them to be the right ones,\u201d she said, and Nour loved her a little for refusing to translate their needs into entertainment. \u201cIf we decorate failure with logos, we will still be failures and more people will be watching.\u201d The dean\u2019s smile held, but his eyes moved to the window where a palm was having its fronds combed by the wind. Nour did not speak. She set the regulator drawing on the table as if it were a photo of the dean\u2019s grandchild and allowed the neatness of the lines to do a part of the persuading. It did, which was a small miracle. He sighed in the particular way of men who wanted to give in with dignity and said to send him the list again, this time with fewer adjectives. When they left, Soraya exhaled like a kettle taken off the stove and bumped her shoulder lightly against Nour\u2019s as if to thank her body for being in the room without performing.\n\nKareem was good at choosing things that promised clarity. The documentary about trains was crisp in its angles and narrated by a voice that sounded like an expensive lecture. They sat side by side in the dark and he made exactly two jokes under his breath, both quiet and both decent, and offered her the popcorn without comment when her fingers hesitated because she had washed them three times and still thought she could smell the faint iron of a wrench. He asked, afterward, if she ever wanted to design and not fix, and he did not say what many people thought, which was that fixing was smaller than designing, but the implication hung like a missing screw you didn\u2019t know where to put back. \u201cFixing is designing backwards,\u201d she said, and his smile was surprised and admiring. He did not argue with her about Fridays. He did not correct her mother on the name of a spice. He drove smoothly and did not perform bravery when a taxi drifted into their lane like a fish. She liked him, which made the no that lived somewhere relaxed inside her chest harder to negotiate with. When her phone bent the night open with Soraya\u2019s message asking if she had left the torque wrench at the lab, she excused herself with the truth and Kareem didn\u2019t do the petty flinch that had broken other men for her. \u201cBring it back with a story I understand,\u201d he said, and when he dropped her at the lab door he did not try to lean in through a moment like a man reaching for a bowl he had not been offered.\n\nMaryam insisted they do the extinguisher drill again even though Farid\u2019s eyebrows insisted they had done enough for a night. She set up a tray of sand and a controlled flame that made the kind of noise that made a room want to be taken seriously. \u201cHere,\u201d she showed Nour, \u201cdo not choke the fire from the top because that is what your fear wants you to do. Slide your breath over it. Persuade the base. Be a diplomat.\u201d Maryam handled danger with a familiarity that would have frightened Nour in any other person. In Maryam it was integrity. After the third run, when the flame died the way a stubborn person sometimes concedes without saying they were wrong, Farid put the pin back in the extinguisher and said, into the room, which was not his habit, \u201cI lost a friend because he salted confidence into a gap that needed humility. I am not eyebrows because I like to stop fun. I am eyebrows because I want to keep your names off a stone.\u201d The sentence changed something quiet in the space. Soraya drew a tick on her list and said nothing witty, which was the correct kind of honor.\n\nMina had the unnerving idea that perhaps they should go to the mangroves before Nour felt ready to decide she would never need to go to the mangroves again. She suggested dawn, because dawn is when the world has not yet built its objections for the day. They rented narrow kayaks that felt like polite pencils over water and pushed off in a corridor of green that did not care who they were. The air tasted like leaf and salt and the old damp secret of mud. Heron stood knee-deep in mirrors and looked like monks. Crabs flailed sideways, offended at this intrusion. The water ducks, the ones who wore their black-and-white with the smug tidiness of uniforms, moved away without hurry and turned their heads to be sure the story was interesting. Nour\u2019s heart did the courtesy of banging for a minute and then slowed because there was nowhere to run and because the word she had brought into her mouth had the texture her body wanted. Smooth, she told her tongue, smooth, as if she were filing an edge off a burr that wanted to catch and tear. Mina\u2019s paddle made small ripples and her breath made a quiet like a secret being kept for the correct reasons. They did not perform therapy. Nobody asked if Nour felt better yet. They drifted. At a bend, a flock of flamingos stood absurd and precise, their legs written in the wrong font, their beaks doing the ta-da motion that seems a joke until you think of mud and the labor that is sifting for food. Nour felt relief that they were not ducks and then irritation with herself for ranking birds by how much they frightened her. She breathed, and the breathing did not cure her. It met her where she was and walked a little way with her.\n\nThere are always the days when other people\u2019s urgencies stick to your clothes. Her mother\u2019s friend Fatima fainted at the women\u2019s center and Nour left in the middle of a torque lecture to drive her and her anxious niece to the clinic, where they sat on orange plastic chairs that had a texture like a lizard and waited while a nurse with eyes like a kind river organized the chaos into something that felt like mercy. Fatima came out with a prescription for the kind of rest women are not offered unless they faint in public, and while Nour scrabbled in her bag for the car keys, her mother, who had arrived with water and dates and the force of a small militia, waved her away and then, as if she had planned to say it at a table rather than under a fluorescent light, said, \u201cYour father would have made the ducks into a joke and then bitten his lip when you laughed and later he would have said to me in the kitchen, we must help her or we will regret the day we raised someone with eyes too open. He had fear. It wore other clothes. He didn\u2019t call it by its name so it sometimes pretended to be something else and he had to chase it around the apartment with a broom and then laugh because the neighbors were listening. I want you to call yours by its name and ask it to stay in one room.\u201d It was the closest she had ever come to telling Nour that the man she missed had been less tidy inside than his stories had led his daughters to believe. Nour touched the soft inside of her mother\u2019s forearm like a person who has been handed a plate full of history and does not want to drop it.\n\nThe first untethered test was put on the board not with a marker but with the carefulness of people who knew that lines could be erased by circumstances and not by will. It was three Thursdays out. It would be small, a hop like a promise rather than a journey, a hand on a ledge to remind the body that it can lift itself. The date clanged against the date her mother had for a cousin\u2019s dinner where Kareem\u2019s mother would attend and deploy the kind of politeness that made people lie about their preferences. Soraya said, \u201cWe should not do it if the wind has opinions,\u201d and Farid said, \u201cWe should not do it if the temperature rises like a man bragging,\u201d and Habib said nothing, which meant he was inventing all the ways it could go wrong and choosing which ones to prevent with his hands. Nour told her mother she couldn\u2019t come to the dinner and her mother, who had decided to be a better ally to her daughter than to other mothers\u2019 plans, made a show of reluctance and then sent a voice note to the cousin full of pious excuses. Kareem wrote, \u201cI will visit my grandparents instead and not offend your rocket,\u201d and sent a small train emoji as if to make sure humor stayed in the room. She wrote back, \u201cWe have a leash but it is hidden; we are pretending it is freedom,\u201d and then put the phone down because the combine harvester in her head that shredded other people\u2019s expectations could be very efficient when it got going.\n\nThey came to the desert again, smaller in number because for once Farid\u2019s eyebrows had scared away spectators who were not serious. The sky was a blank coin; it did not plan to show them anything, which was a mercy. The rocket stood in the stand like a child in a school uniform, tidy and hopeful and perhaps ready to cry. Nour moved through the checks with a slowness that felt like competence and not dread, because Mina had told her her body could not tell the difference if she performed ease long enough to forget acting. A bird trailed its shadow across the sand behind the stand during the first ignition cycle and her throat made a muscle that wanted to become her whole. She put a hand down flat on the console and felt the plastic\u2019s unromantic warmth and named the bird in her head something else, a flash, a moving piece of shade, a nothing that her muscles could arrange themselves around without preparing to die. \u201cHold,\u201d she said into the calm of everyone\u2019s expectation, and Maryam, who once had learned to admire people who hesitated for good reasons, nodded and adjusted the clock. The bird tilted away because birds obeyed a physics of their own and cared nothing for engineering. Farid gestured a small circle that meant, fine, we can have another breath, and Habib put his hand on the line that led to flame and said in a low tone, because you always asked A God before you asked your god, \u201cNow.\u201d It rose the way a breath rises before a word. It rose and it was small and it was nothing you would put on a poster, and still, in the way the sand moved and the strap did not move because there was no strap and the stand held and the numbers were within their lines, it was the kind of victory you had to be standing close to in order to see. Soraya shouted and then remembered not to and clapped her hands over her mouth and clapped anyway because why not. Farid did a thing with his eyebrows she would later call a dance if anyone asked.\n\nThey were still laughing like idiots when Nour\u2019s phone found service and drank all the messages it had missed. Her mother had sent a picture of a coffee tray and a thumbs-up. Kareem had sent a photograph of his grandmother\u2019s hands on a prayer bead and a sentence, \u201cI hope your fire behaved; mine did.\u201d Mina had sent nothing, which was also a message, a space left for Nour to fill with her own experience rather than narrate it on command. Habib handed out dates and said, now we will talk about the one degree it leaned and the half degree of thermal expansion we did not seduce into compliance. Soraya wanted to dance and Maryam wanted everyone to drink more water and Farid wanted the list to be updated before the high of success made everyone lie to themselves about what had gone wrong that had not gone wrong far enough to injure.\n\nOn the edge of that day and the next, the story at the workshop, the one that used to be \u201cduck girl,\u201d became subject to vandalism. Someone\u2014probably the delivery man from three doors down who thought his wit had been underappreciated by history\u2014stuck a sticky note on her box of sockets that read \u201cQuack Queen.\u201d Bassam saw it before she did and removed it with a violence that was almost affectionate, then threw the note under the workbench and crushed it with an unconvincing attempt to look casual. Arif appeared, took the long way around to the trash, and then stood in front of the men as if he were about to give a speech he had not written. \u201cHer name is Nour,\u201d he said to the room with the tone of a man who had decided to put his hand on a machine to see if it was dangerous and had found that it was less dangerous than letting it make noise. \u201cYou call her Nour or you say hey mechanic like you say hey to me and you put your little jokes where the sun can dry them out until they shrink.\u201d Someone muttered a complaint about how nobody could have fun anymore and Arif looked at him with a face that said fun had been repossessed pending payments. The room changed, a tiny click only people like Nour would hear. She felt the lack of a weight as much as she would have felt the weight itself.\n\nSoraya lived in an apartment that had a view of a piece of a park and a busy road and a sliver of the kind of sky that seemed like an architectural detail rather than atmosphere. She invited Nour over on a Sunday with the promise of fresh bread and coffee and a consultation about a diagram that had started to lose its shyness. Nour arrived with jam and a container of olives from a store where the olives liked to sit in fat, and stood in the doorway while Soraya apologized for the way her table was dedicated to indecisions about fins. The bread, glossy and brown like a pomegranate seed writ large, made the room smell like men in novels who come home to women in aprons except there was no man and no apron and the women did their own dishes. They ate with their fingers and wiped the plates with the bread in a way that would have made someone\u2019s aunt wince, and talked about Damascus with a tenderness that had little to do with geography and everything to do with a childhood full of ordinary violence and oranges. Soraya had a plant that didn\u2019t understand why it was alive and Nour had empathy. She watered it with the stinginess of someone who wants a relationship to mean something. The talk, without any announcement, drifted toward the place it sometimes tilted now, the ledge where it looked down into a pool that could be called love if you began to point at it too soon and could be called friendship if you wanted to keep your bones inside their famous boxes. Soraya laughed and touched Nour\u2019s wrist with exactly the amount of pressure you use when you want to confirm that a thing exists but would prefer not to risk cracking it, and Nour looked away at a fly on the window that seemed to be practicing a speech and said that Habib believed aluminum became dreamy when it was hot and she feared she became dreamy when she was not careful. Soraya put her chin in her hand and said, \u201cWe will use steel when we have to and forgive aluminum when we can,\u201d and there was a moment like the pause before a song decides to not play the note you expected.\n\nThe storm that week came with less theater than the shamal and did more quiet damage. It arrived with a dense ceiling that moved like a patient with a drip, and by noon the city had turned into a wet machine. The workshop roof decided it was decorative and allowed water where water was not invited. They moved boxes like people saving books in a house getting a new roof, grumbling and sliding tarps around like chess pieces. When the door stuck because the wood learned to swell, they propped it open because nobody wanted to be trapped in a room that smelled like oil and wet cardboard and humility. Late in the afternoon, in that tired hour when even jokes limp, something small and wet with a purpose waddled in under the propped door and gave the floor a look like a man making an appraisal of real estate. It was a duck, or a cousin of a duck, or the ghost of the first duck that had rearranged Nour\u2019s sense of what rooms were for. Bassam yelped in a way that he would deny later and Arif lifted his hands and then lowered them because he remembered the last time his flapping had taught the bird everything it needed to know about chaos. Nour was at the back, wiping a spill and wondering if the rag ever learned it was laboring under a metaphor, and she straightened and turned and caught it full in the body, that combination of panic and history and the muscle memory of an animal you had never held having already held you. Her vision did the brief ring-around of a tunnel and then loosened. She pressed her thumb into her palm, found the small bone Mina had showed her, and said nothing because speaking felt like declaring war or surrendering and neither was asked for. The duck advanced with the constitutional of a minister inspecting a new building. It peered under the Saab these days sleeping in one corner like a lazy prince. It did not fly, because it did not want to, because perhaps it knew something about rooms and ceilings that she herself had learned the hard way.\n\nBassam whispered, as if the duck were an examiner, \u201cShould we offer it coffee,\u201d and Arif whispered back, \u201cOffer it the door.\u201d Nour took one step to the side, not toward it and not away. In that space, which was narrow and held too many tools, she could sense each exit as if her fear had dropped coins in every slot. She did not look at the duck\u2019s eye because that was a needle into which her panic had threaded its loudest thread, but she did not look away in flinching either. She looked at the floor a foot ahead of its feet and let her breath arrange itself around the word. Smooth went through her like a small boat on water, not loud, not a question subject to debate. The duck reached the door\u2019s spill of light and paused as if to check its credentials. It turned its head, as if inconvenienced by the weather, and then it went out the way good stories leave, with a last small punctuation rather than a moral. The room did not erupt into applause because the room was not a movie. Bassam exhaled like a balloon losing a secret. Arif chuckled in the low register of men congratulating themselves on not having made things worse. Nour leaned her hip against the workbench and found that her knees were not jelly, exactly. They were made of a substance that does not belong in textbooks but that engineers would learn to name if they watched women in storms.\n\nLater, she told Mina and Mina did not call it a triumph. She called it a good visit. Later, she told Soraya and Soraya sent back a duck emoji and then the words, \u201cI will write your name on the inside of my skull tonight so I can remember how to be brave when a dean asks me to be charming.\u201d Later, she told her mother and her mother threw her hands in the air and thanked God as if God handled ducks personally, then pretended she had never doubted her daughter could walk through any room in any world and find the spoons in the right drawer.\n\nThe day they queued for a part at a warehouse in an industrial zone whose streets had discovered how to be both grid and maze, Nour stood behind a man whose shirt announced he fixed lifts for a living and in front of a teenager whose shirt announced a band he had never heard live. The air smelled like boxes and resignation. Soraya had gone to sign something in a glass office where the man wore a watch too large for his wrist and Farid had sent them both a checklist to fill out while they waited because he believed boredom was where risk bred. The teen behind her watched a video on his phone of a seaplane touching down and skimming a blue that wished it had been a lake in a place where summer came with a different curriculum. He glanced up at her and said, in the conversational tone of someone who thinks he has discovered a neutral topic, \u201cI\u2019m going to learn to fly,\u201d and she said, \u201cI\u2019m going to learn to land,\u201d and he laughed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s always the same thing,\u201d and she said, \u201cNo,\u201d and he said nothing else because he was a person who had just been told there were two kinds of same.\n\nBy the time the clamps arrived and the regulator had been coaxed into the shape opera would be proud of and the desert had made a habit of accepting their footprints, Nour had started to think of ducks as something she would one day have to explain to someone younger until they grew up and acquired their own ridiculous thing. Kareem sat with her on a bench after the train film and asked her if she might like to see a real train yard in Mina Zayed where rust rehearsed the end of steel and she said yes to the yard and no to the implication that she was ready to fit her hours into a container that had to be inventoried by someone else. He told her about a project that would send him to Sharjah for two months and she felt a small release like a knot loosening in a rope because distance is not always a threat; sometimes it is a place to think without being watched.\n\nOn an evening that did not think it was different from any other, Laila called and asked if she would come speak to a girl in her class who had decided that being the only woman in a room meant she had arrived at the wrong room. Nour went and found a girl who looked like every girl and like no girl she had ever met, a girl who was trying to make her hands listen to a torque wrench and make her ears ignore laughter from a cluster of young men who had not yet learned to train their joy into something useful. She told the girl what Laila had told her and what her mother would have told her and what Mina would whisper in a room with water and what Soraya said with her eyes when she watched a gauge steady, and when the girl laughed at exactly one joke in the right way and refused four others, when she placed the wrench on the bolt and felt a thing line up that had not lined up inside her before, Nour sat down on the stool and looked away because sometimes the dignity you can offer someone is pretending you\u2019ve seen this small miracle a thousand times and it still makes you happy but you won\u2019t make a song and dance because you know it will scare it off.\n\nThere was talk of flying to Liwa because the sand there was a different language and the sky was a bigger permission. Habib had cousins there too because men like Habib have cousins everywhere a tool is admired. Farid said if they went he would make a tent out of caution and make them sleep under it. Soraya wanted to fly at dawn because dawn had been kind to her once and you never forget who was kind to you when you were small. Nour wanted to be under a machine that obeyed her even if for a handful of seconds. It was the kind of plan that put a new layer on your days, a glaze that made everything reflect more light. In bed one night, before sleep, she thought of the moment the duck had crossed the workshop and been only a duck, and the way the rocket had risen and been only a machine, and the way a boy in a striped shirt had listened to a ratchet like it was a lullaby, and the way her mother had looked at her and said a thing no one had taught her to say because mothers sometimes have to invent sentences on the spot. She thought of all the hands, how they were a culture of their own, and how they trained the heart to be less dramatic.\n\nIn the morning, she received a message from a number she did not know with a photograph of a note pinned to the corkboard by the elevator that read in neat handwriting, \u201cIf your fear is called by a name, introduce it to your other names.\u201d There was no signature. She smiled at the corkboard like a conspirator and walked into the day with a sense that the city had decided to become a little bit of a village, and that somewhere in the rafters some small creature was making a nest that would not be evicted because it chose the right ledge and the right time.8\n\nThey left for Liwa at an hour that seemed to belong to other creatures. Abu Dhabi had not yet decided what face to put on; its glass towers held their reflections to their chests like secret photographs, and the arterial roads ran without pulse. Nour carried sleep like a heavy sweater over one arm and a box of clamps as if the clamps might learn to escape if she let them feel too free. Soraya\u2019s voice on the phone\u2014bring the spare igniters, I left them in the fridge next to the labneh, don\u2019t ask\u2014made her smile into the dark of the stairwell. Her mother had set dates and walnuts by the door with the obvious pretense that she had simply forgotten them there and not stayed up long past her own patience to see her daughter off. \u201cSend me one picture of sand and one of your eyebrows when you are not pretending not to be afraid,\u201d she had said in a whisper that pretended to be practical. Nour kissed the side of her face and promised what she could.\n\nBy the time they were on the highway that sloped out of the city like a stitched seam, the dawn had started lacing light between the low clouds. Trucks carried their mysteries into the interior. The radio played Qur\u2019an at a volume that made even the air-conditioner behave more respectfully. Soraya hummed under her breath between sips of coffee that had not cooled enough to be drinkable but had been declared drinkable by will. Habib was already ahead by an hour, his cousin having called to say the dunes had shifted the way lazy kings rearrange furniture. Farid sent a message that included wind speed, humidity, and a photograph of his shoes on the sand with a caption that read, \u201cStable enough to displease me less than usual.\u201d Maryam, in her way, sent no message, which was better than a promise because it indicated she had already counted the extinguishers and insulted the one whose gauge looked like it was lying.\n\nLiwa rolled up out of the dark like a beast humping its back. The dunes were not polite mounds; they were long, sinuous spines, their crests combed by a hand that wanted drama. The sand here was a different grammar. It slid and sang and made the wind a speechmaker. Habib waited with the kind of patience that can only be earned by saying no to something that wanted to be yes a thousand times. He stood by the Land Cruiser with a thermos and a smile that didn\u2019t move the corners of his mouth and said, \u201cThe ridge there will keep the morning steady until nine. After that, it will be like arguing with a teenager. Put your machines on this side so they do not think they are the ones who own the sky.\u201d\n\nThey built the day like a small temple. The stand, lower and braced wide because sand doesn\u2019t bargain with narrow bases, took its place facing a line where the ground leaned without committing to an angle. Farid measured things nobody else would have thought to measure; he tapped the guy lines with his boot and listened like a man reading a poem for tone. Soraya\u2019s hair, braided furiously, swung behind her like a punctuation mark you could use to end an argument. Nour laid out the clamps and bolts on a piece of tarp where the edges had been weighted with shoes and one stubborn rock. The power pack made its little industrial whine and for a moment it sounded like a mosquito deciding whether to insult them; then it settled into usefulness. The sun climbed as if it had been dared. Their shadows pulled themselves thin and lay down.\n\nNour\u2019s chest made its old preparations, but the rest of her had learned other habits. She pressed her thumb into the soft place in her palm when the wind made a sudden suggestion across her neck. She let the word smooth melt across her tongue without bothering her with meaning. She counted the exits even in a place with no walls to give exits their character. She made another inventory, the one she liked better: Habib\u2019s oversight, Soraya\u2019s eyes like flashlights, Farid\u2019s eyebrows like a fence you were glad was there, Maryam\u2019s extinguishers like small blunt promises. When Soraya leaned close to ask if the data cable sat properly and her breath warmed Nour\u2019s cheek through the morning chill, Nour\u2019s mind flickered to Kareem\u2019s message\u2014a picture of the Sharjah commuter line at dawn with only one passenger visible, a caption reading \u201cFor your train heart\u201d\u2014and back again without getting lost. It was like holding two tools and knowing which one to use without insulting the other.\n\n\u201cLast checks,\u201d Farid said, and even the wind quieted the way men quiet at the beginning of prayer. Habib ran a hand along the frame as if smoothing back hair from a child\u2019s forehead. Nour crouched to the regulator and felt the metal, warmer now, under her fingers with that intimate recognition mechanics carry like religion. The new quick-release clamps sat with a smug handsomeness that made her want to slap them and also kiss them. Soraya mounted the little payload, a packet that would betray altitude and attitude with precision and self-respect, and murmured something under her breath that sounded suspiciously like a negotiation with fate.\n\nThe first ignition was a breath. It lifted a hand\u2019s breadth, more a shrug than a jump, and settled obedient as if to say, I have seen the idea, I am willing to consider it. The sand puffed and fell. The second went higher, the lean corrected by a whisper of thrust vectoring that Soraya would credit to math and Nour would credit to kindness and Habib would credit to their grandmothers. They whooped weakly, cautious about waking any gods lazing under the dunes. On the third, the machine forgot itself for a second, as machines do. The nozzle coughed, a pop like arrogance becomes humility, and the body tilted in the wrong direction as if trying on a slant somebody else had recommended. Nour, who had been watching in two directions as always\u2014numbers and sand, Soraya\u2019s face and Habib\u2019s posture\u2014felt the wrongness before she could name it. She took a step without thinking and then took it back because moving toward was not the wisdom here. Maryam was already upright, extinguisher in her hands like an old friend being reintroduced at a party. Farid\u2019s eyebrows performed the equivalence of a shouted stop. Soraya\u2019s fingers went to the cut switch before Nour had completed the thought that they should. The engine shut down with the offended beep of a machine told it could not have the toy it wanted. They all breathed.\n\n\u201cHeat soak,\u201d Habib said after a quiet that would have embarrassed a showman. \u201cWe are greedy. We make it humble with time.\u201d He squinted at the fin that had caught a kiss from grit and tilted his head so the glare slid off his eyes. \u201cShe would have landed. She wanted to show off and then she remembered who was watching.\u201d\n\nIt was the kind of benign scare that strengthens bonds instead of loosening screws. They turned the stand into a lecture for themselves: this snugness here, that shameful almost-pulse there. Soraya scribbled a note on the back of her hand, then shook it, laughter bubbling up through the layers of adrenaline. \u201cFarid, your eyebrows nearly launched independently,\u201d she said, and he sniffed in a way that admitted how close a thing had been to the kind of moment he had given his life over to preventing. Nour flexed her fingers, surprised by the gentler tremor that traveled through her bones; it was not panic, it was aftershock, and she could forgive it. She looked at the sky, its bland generosity, at the dune with its long lip like a smirk, and thought of how often she had mistaken the universe\u2019s indifference for mercy and then, sometimes, it surprised her by being merciful anyway.\n\nThey ate the dates her mother had insisted look accidental on the counter. Sand stuck to the side of the thermos and made the coffee taste like someone\u2019s backyard in summer. Habib\u2019s cousin arrived for a visit and did the desert thing where you sit down and let your words fall out like seeds; he told a story about a camel that refused to cross a shadow, repeated with relish the phrase \u201cstupid champion,\u201d and in the middle of his second cup asked Soraya without malice if her father knew where she was. \u201cHe knows where he lost me,\u201d she said, and the cousin laughed with his head thrown back and clapped his hands as if she had done a magic trick.\n\nBy nine, the wind made itself into a person in the room who wouldn\u2019t wait their turn to speak. They packed, slower than they needed to because leaving any piece behind would be a curse nobody wanted to put their name on. The stand went into the back with the patient exhale of metal fitting around metal. Soraya wiped a smear of oil from Nour\u2019s cheek with her thumb and then seemed startled by her own interference, her hand hovering as if editing its gesture. Nour tilted her face into the pressure with a brief shamelessness and then reached for the tarp, which was less dangerous than what she wanted.\n\nDriving back, the radio decided to play songs that have learned to be better than they are because they remind you of a time you were okay. Soraya, who had been vibrating on a string of what-if since the cough, began to talk in little bursts about ignorance and luck and the plan to take everything apart that night. \u201cWe will soften our greed with math,\u201d she said, and looked at Nour when she wanted to borrow steadiness. Nour told her about Laila\u2019s sentence\u2014do less cleanly\u2014and watched the way that phrase tucked itself into Soraya\u2019s chest like a folded cloth. She texted her mother one picture of a dune and one of her own eyebrows angled deliberately into a pretend worry; her mother sent back a laugh broken into pieces by voice note and a photograph of a frying pan that might once have dreamed of flying too. Kareem\u2019s message chimed like a polite knock on a door\u2014my grandfather fell asleep on his prayer beads during duhr, the train yard smelled like bread\u2014 and she wrote back, preserving the thread but not knitting anything with it that would be hard to undo. The road unspooled into city, warehouse fronts blinking awake into their desultory industry.\n\nThe workshop had taken the storm personally and then forgiven it. The smell inside was that specific combination of hot rubber and damp cloth that made Nour think of childhood in the summer when her father kept the balcony door cracked during rain just to smell it, just to let the house remember the world was not always an apartment. Arif had lost a shelf to stubborn gravity and was performing a funeral that involved muttered curses and a broom. Bassam wore the expression of a man who had been made to move something heavy for someone who had called him brother. The pigeons had reconstituted themselves on the ledge, like a myth you cannot fix by throwing water at it. \u201cYou come back with all your parts,\u201d Arif observed, glancing at Nour\u2019s wrists as if he had learned to count her fingers by instinct. \u201cGod is generous when people are careful.\u201d He did not ask for stories because he would get them from her face and from Soraya\u2019s hands later when she arrived with a regulator to apply to his arguments about the price of valves.\n\nThey rolled into the routine so quickly it felt like a trick. A sedan with an electrical problem asked her to listen with the part of her that had been trained by ghosts. A man with a busted alternator wanted to tell her about his grandchild and she wanted to ask him what he thought of men who took pictures of ducks but she kept her questions to the sort that had solutions you could hold. The boy in the striped shirt from the marina came in with his father to pick up a part and stumped importantly around the shop with a piece of scrap pipe like a baton. He saluted her with it and she saluted back with her ratchet and his father put a hand over his mouth to hide a grin and failed. \u201cHe made a speech to the ducks last week,\u201d the man said, eyes shining with pride that had found a place to sit. \u201cThey listened badly but he believes himself and that is victory.\u201d\n\nIn the evening, she went with her mother to the cousin\u2019s dinner she had skipped last week for the desert, because life insisted on its balance sheet. The apartment smelled like cumin and talc and women\u2019s perfume that wanted to flirt with strangers. Kareem\u2019s mother had the face of someone who had survived several eras of decorum and had adjusted her grace accordingly; she pressed Nour\u2019s hand and asked about engines in a way that made the questions into offerings instead of tests. Kareem himself looked tired in a way that made his kindness even more visible, the way certain metals show their polish better in dim light. He stood with Nour by the window during a brief lull when a child had knocked over a glass and everyone had to become firefighters, and he told her a story about his grandmother teaching him to balance a tray of tea glasses on one hand, the patience required, the muscle in the forearm you never think about until it hurts. She wanted to tell him that holding a rocket engine with restraint was the same lesson at another volume, but she thought maybe he knew that already and that their analogies did not need to be identical to be a kind of intimacy. His hand brushed her knuckles when he took the emptied plate from her, a touch so practiced it could have been accidental, and she let it be accidental because sometimes that is kinder to everyone involved.\n\nAfter, on the drive home, her mother made small approving noises about how Kareem\u2019s mother folded her napkin, about the way Kareem did not ask if Nour intended to stop working when she married because he had learned not to mistake politeness for ambition. Nour made noises in reply that could be read as agreement and could be read as evasive; she did not want to pin the future to the upholstery of the car. \u201cI did not ask you to choose tonight,\u201d her mother said finally, which is what mothers say when their bones ache with the effort of not asking. \u201cI am trying not to ask you to choose any night. I am learning from your rockets about tethering. You see? I am modern.\u201d The laugh that followed caught on a stitch in her breath. Nour reached across and squeezed the bony place under her mother\u2019s elbow that had always been the secret lever making her soften, and her mother sniffed as if the city had put too much pepper in its dust and then changed the radio to a song about tea and lovers.\n\nThe week folded itself into days that pretended to be ordinary and were not. Soraya developed a way of looking at the whiteboard that meant nobody should interrupt her surrender to an idea unless the building was burning. Farid found a small conspiracy of risk in a bracket everyone had ignored and dismantled it with the satisfaction of a man who believes he can reduce the number of times the world surprises him badly. Maryam took Nour aside and taught her how to read the way a flame leans in a breeze indoors, because not all danger announces itself with noise. Laila stopped by the workshop unannounced and watched Nour for ten minutes the way a person watches a pot to catch it in the act of boiling, then nodded once and left a small package on the counter containing a pair of gloves with better tactility that felt like being handed a compliment wrapped in rubber. Mina sent a voice note that was only the sound of the sea near the corniche and it left Nour with the feeling of salt drying on skin and a whisper about how bodies keep score in their own sloppy ledgers.\n\nOn a Tuesday afternoon with heat that pushed at the windows and tried to be a personality trait, the call came that the university wanted to put them in the glossy magazine that alumni used to prove the money had not been wasted on future. Soraya groaned and then made her hair behave until it matched someone\u2019s notion of competence, which amused Nour so much she said a sentence she had not planned. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be beautiful for money,\u201d she said, and Soraya\u2019s mouth tilted into a smile that involved shame and agreement and something like warmth that had no business in a fluorescent hallway. They posed with their machines and tried to look as if they did not know where the camera was, and afterward Soraya stole Nour into a stairwell that had been painted five times and smelled like institutional lemon. \u201cIf this were a story someone made up,\u201d she said, propping her foot on a step and lacing and unlacing, \u201cwe would be halfway to a catastrophe that would teach us what we love. I would prefer to skip the catastrophe.\u201d Nour laughed and said she would too, and they stood there with that option on the landing between them like baggage neither wanted to claim.\n\nThat night, in a small reprieve between obligations heavy as engines, Nour went to the Corniche without needing to prove anything to herself. The water wore the light that came off the hotels like borrowed jewelry and the air had decided to be breathable. Ducks made their sketch of the day in the shallow ripples; their necks were lines the city could not draw with steel. A child ran by holding a plastic bag like a kite and his father pretended to chase him with a roar that turned halfway into laughter. Nour sat on a low wall and put her palms against the stone and thought about the absurd amount of work it takes to be a person who is not ruled by their fear and who is still allowed to often look silly. The ducks came close enough for her to pretend she wasn\u2019t looking at them, then turned away as if they had seen an invitation in the next reflection in the water. Her body made its reliable notes and then softened them. When her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number that turned out to be the girl from Laila\u2019s class\u2014\u201cI told a boy to move his shoulder and he moved it and the bolt listened to me and I laughed in my head until I cried\u201d\u2014Nour felt that light bruise of joy she had grown accustomed to carrying, the one that arrived whenever a machine obeyed and whenever somebody reached past the easy story someone else had written for them.\n\nThe week decided it had been generous enough and sent in a small incident as if to balance the ledger. A fleet driver, in a hurry to be somewhere his supervisor had described as urgent, backed too close to the open door of the workshop and kissed it with the bumper. The sound rang through the room with the clang of a bell someone had not meant to ring. Everyone made the faces of people who had anticipated an accident in their bones all morning. The door creaked like an old woman asked to dance and then settled at an angle that made Arif swear quietly because he didn\u2019t like when things fell away from square. They propped it with a jack and used new bolts and old tricks, and the driver apologized with the extravagance of a man who has just realized how far favors can be withdrawn. Nour worked alongside Arif in a silence that was not sullen and not quite peaceful, her hands the steady counsel of muscle memory. When they finished, Arif clapped her shoulder in a way that might later have grown a speech if he had been a different man. \u201cYou must go home and sleep tonight,\u201d he said instead, the kind of sentence that needs no flourish in a city that teaches you to hurry. \u201cYour brain will think you are a superhero. Let it become stupid. Then it will behave for me tomorrow.\u201d\n\nShe intended to obey. She intended to sleep like a person who had deserved it. Instead, at midnight, her phone lit with Farid\u2019s name and a message that used too many words for him to hide good news inside it. He had found a mistake in an assumption they had been treating like a rock, a tiny miscalculation in thermal expansion that would, if left untended, turn into a kind of betrayal during a hot noon test in a place like Liwa. He had rewritten the page with a pen that made his handwriting aggressive. \u201cI would like not to be the man who saved you by being a bore,\u201d he wrote with a care that made Nour\u2019s throat ache unexpectedly. \u201cI prefer to be boring and to keep your every finger attached.\u201d She wrote back something that teased his eyebrows into a smile in her head and promised a morning with calipers and a guilty fitting. Sleep came not as a gift but as a pause inserted by a body reaching its limit without her permission.\n\nIn the dream that carried her, she stood in the workshop with the ceiling fan turned off and the quiet so complete she could hear the heat radiate. The duck entered\u2014of course it did\u2014but it was wearing around its neck a small string of nuts like someone trying to carry their tools without hands. Soraya leaned in the doorway with her hands dirty the way Nour liked them best and said, \u201cWe have threaded the wrong fear,\u201d and Mina said from a stool she hadn\u2019t been sitting on when Nour walked in, \u201cWe can unthread it,\u201d and Arif argued with a poet about torque, and her father sat on the hood of a car he would never have been allowed to own, smoking a cigarette he would have promised he had quit, and said to her very plainly, \u201cAsk for the wrench you want,\u201d and in the dream Nour did, and when she woke the sentence sat on her tongue like a coin she could spend that very day.\n\nBy the time the sun climbed the face of Wednesday, she was at the lab with the fitting Farid distrusted and the gloves Laila had gifted and a loaf of bread from Soraya that turned out to be perfect in slices and terrible at restraint. Farid pointed to the numbers as if pointing to a pickpocket leaving the room. Habib held the part like a small animal and told it the story of its future. Maryam leaned over the printout and took a picture because sometimes you needed proof later that you had known the truth early. Soraya watched Nour\u2019s hands as if she\u2019d forgotten how hands make you brave, and Nour let herself be watched. They shaved a sliver from the assumption and filed another from pride. The part fit the way a sentence fits in a mouth when you have learned to say it without tripping. At noon, the call came from the glossy magazine asking for a quote and Soraya said, without irony and without explanation, \u201cWe work small because we want to be big later without dying,\u201d and Nour added, \u201cWe check until checking is part of our bone,\u201d and the young woman on the phone said, \u201cShould I really write the word bone,\u201d and then laughed because she was not ready to be in the room with that kind of real.\n\nLate afternoon, the sky bruised purple in a way Nour had always liked, and she found herself at the sink washing her hands slowly enough to admire, not for the first time, the way grease left reluctantly the way some fears do. Her phone beeped a new message from an old friend who had moved to Canada and had started posting pictures of trees that pretended to be authors. \u201cI miss the heat,\u201d the friend wrote, as if she were confessing something indecent. \u201cI miss the way the city makes you earn evening.\u201d Nour typed back a photograph of the workshop\u2019s door at an angle, the repaired seam visible like a scar and as honorable, and wrote, \u201cWe learn to love the thing after it breaks and then is mended correctly,\u201d and her friend sent three hearts and then a long story about how in their new city ducks were a menace and Nour laughed out loud, alone, in a room full of machines that hadn\u2019t laughed yet, and thought, look how far a story can walk and still return.\n\nWhen she closed up, after Arif had done his ritual of counting money and disappointment and after Bassam had put away the rag he always forgot until the last minute, Nour stepped into the hallway that led to the world and nearly tripped over a small cardboard box left beside the elevator. On top of it, a note in unfamiliar handwriting read, in careful Arabic that wore its practice proudly, \u201cFor the woman who is not bread.\u201d Inside were three small bags of duck feed with a drawing of a mallard looking judgmental and, underneath, a mechanic\u2019s glove in a size that was actually hers. She stood there with her mouth tipping toward a laugh and a softness that felt like someone pressing the heel of their hand briefly against the pulse in her throat. The security guard from the gate\u2014who had taught himself to joke with dignity and who had once warned her about quacking forever\u2014peeked around the corner like a child who hadn\u2019t decided whether to run away or be congratulated. \u201cMy wife said the joke was not nice,\u201d he blurted, the sentences tumbling as if they were in a race. \u201cShe saw me put that paper and she said, shame, you are a father, so I brought this. Maybe your ducks eat this and leave you alone. Maybe you will give the glove to someone who deserves it. I did not know your size but I remembered your hands.\u201d Nour put the box down carefully before she did something that would embarrass both of them, like cry or adopt him. \u201cShukran,\u201d she said, and the word had weight, and he bowed with the dignity that comes from being a man who has corrected himself in front of witnesses.\n\nUpstairs, her mother had left the balcony door open again and the lace curtain performed its old theater. The television had decided on a program where a man in a white coat yelled at a bowl of rice. On the table sat a fat aubergine that looked like it knew a secret. Her mother lifted it like a trophy and announced that tomorrow they would burn it directly on the gas the old way, not the fussy way, and Nour said in a voice heavier with contentment than she had expected, \u201cBurn it until it learns to be sweet,\u201d and her mother\u2019s eyebrows lifted in approval because she liked when her daughter found an analogy she could put in her pocket and take to a conversation with an aunt.\n\nThe night had scraped one star clean of haze when Soraya texted, an unguarded line that barely kept its lungs from the page. \u201cYou asked for the wrench you wanted,\u201d she wrote without preamble, as if she had been in the dream with the cigarette and the crook in the bookshelf. \u201cWhat did you get.\u201d Nour typed, then deleted, then typed again, learned from her engines that sometimes torque had to be gradual or you stripped the threads. \u201cA day,\u201d she sent finally. \u201cA day where I stand in a room that used to be a fight and I bend metal and make heat behave and someone brings me humor in a box and you steal me to stairwells to ask for miracles and I remember my father\u2019s voice without pretending it was always wise. I got that wrench.\u201d The dots pulsed\u2014Soraya, thinking how to answer without flinching\u2014and then the reply arrived, plain, as dry as the desert that had become generous to them, \u201cKeep it near.\u201dChapter 10\n\nMornings arrived with a new kind of softness after Liwa, as if the desert\u2019s long back had stretched something inside the city that no longer snapped back. Abu Dhabi still did its morning theatrics\u2014call to prayer stitched through the air like a silver thread, buses yawning awake, shop shutters rattling their bones\u2014but Nour felt a greasy hinge in herself had been oiled. At the workshop, the smell of last night\u2019s rain sat lightly on the threshold like a polite guest who would leave before lunch. Arif made a show of sweeping water toward a drain that had always been there and never worked, while Bassam held a hair dryer over a fuse box as if he were talking sense into a stubborn uncle. In the corner, the box the security guard had left with the duck feed and the glove had been repurposed to hold rags, and on the inside flap someone\u2014not Bassam, his handwriting was cockier\u2014had written, in careful block letters, her name. She didn\u2019t correct the reverence of it; names written on cardboard were as holy as names written anywhere else if they found the right eyes to impress.\n\nThe magazine piece crawled into the world with the morning like a shy animal and then pretended it had always belonged there. It showed Soraya and Nour at the edge of a stand in Al Khatm, the ribbon of cable dressed nice for the camera, Farid\u2019s eyebrows trimmed by the crop of a photo editor, Habib\u2019s hands stoically cut out of the frame as if hands made people nervous. The text wore its adjectives like guests at a wedding not sure where to stand, but the quotes sounded like them because they had refused to translate too much. Her mother read it three times and each time made a different face\u2014pride the first, suspicion the second, a third expression Nour had not seen before that was a little like grief and a little like admiration that had forgotten to perform. A cousin sent a voice note that consisted entirely of squeals and the line, \u201cYa Allah, you look like money,\u201d which was unintentionally the most practical compliment anyone had paid them. Kareem texted a picture of the page laid on a table beside one of his grandfather\u2019s teacups, the cup\u2019s rim crazed with delicate cracks like a map of a tiny country that had decided to be beautiful about its age, and added, \u201cI like your sentence about working small because you want to be big later without dying.\u201d She typed \u201ccopyright Farid\u2019s eyebrows\u201d and deleted it and sent instead a duck emoji and a wrench, not because it meant anything but because emojis sometimes understood better that meaning could be a long corridor and not a tight room.\n\nMoney called with its mouth half full. A logistics company wanted their logo near the stand and their name in a paragraph that would be read under air-conditioning by men who bought golf clubs they never used. A man in a suit the color of compromise came to the lab with a suggestion about how to make the rocket \u201cfriendlier for families,\u201d as if it were a dessert on a menu. Soraya smiled with both kindness and steel and asked him where he wanted to stand during a test and if he had a favorite distance from the spray of grit when combustion remembered who it was meant to be. He laughed thinly and said his niece liked pink, and Nour had to look away to prevent the look on her face from becoming a story someone else would tell as proof women were difficult. Farid sent a message that had only three words\u2014no brand near flame\u2014and a list of regulation clauses that could be waved like a small polite sword if needed. Habib weighed a quick-release clamp in his palm while the man talked and afterward said, in a voice so even it counted as respect, that sometimes the only friendship worth discussing was between metal and math.\n\nAt night, when Abu Dhabi did its glittering imitation of a lake, Nour walked to the corner grocery where the owner liked her because she bought things that made sense\u2014oil, bread, dates, two onions\u2014and did not ask him for absurd fruits that had traveled farther than some people. The owner asked about the rocket and she told him the rocket had opinions and was learning to keep them to itself for three seconds at a time. On the way back, a thin cat with a white mustache escorted her for twenty meters and then left with no farewell, which she respected. At home, her mother folded laundry with the air of a general arranging troops, the bedsheet snapping into a straight line with a little zero-g flourish. \u201cKareem\u2019s grandmother likes you,\u201d she offered as if she were handing over a small, well-balanced tool. \u201cShe said your hands are honest. She said you will not make her son into a liar.\u201d\n\nNour took the pillowcase and the compliment and put both away where they would not be misplaced. \u201cI like that his grandmother sleeps after lunch,\u201d she said, because that had impressed her\u2014an old woman who did not apologize for taking rest where the day thought it had rights over her. \u201cI like that she told him not to call her from the train because she can hear the motion and it makes her want to be inside it.\u201d Her mother nodded, approving of women who had the courage to deny love\u2019s interruptions. Then, as if she were changing the oil in a story, she drew a breath and delivered, with a deliberately offhand tone, the news that a neighbor\u2019s son was moving to Canada and had a position waiting for him as an engineer in a place where snow was a mood, not a novelty. The insertion was a test of the emergency system in Nour\u2019s chest; the alarms blinked and then went back to steady because she had nothing to declare at customs yet, nothing to declare to herself at least in front of her mother. \u201cCanada is a quilt,\u201d Nour said, watching her mother\u2019s face in the reflection of the window. \u201cPeople love quilts when they\u2019re under them and curse them when they try to fold them into an overhead compartment.\u201d\n\nThe university added another hoop to their small circus: a demonstration for a visiting committee who had money and wanted an attitude to match. Soraya wrote the date on the whiteboard as if she were writing down the name of a woman she would not love and would nonetheless be polite to. Farid circled it with a broken oval that looked like it might choose to release them at any moment. Maryam insisted on a drill that had them move through three failure modes in a row without losing their humor\u2014a kind of rehearsal for grief turning into jokes and back again. Habib found a man who used to deliver air conditioners in the back of pickup trucks and had figured out the right way to strap a thing so it did not develop ambitions while you drove; he showed them a knot that looked like nothing and then refused to come undone with the obstinacy of a good marriage. Nour took the knot into her body with that particular pleasure that only mechanics and grandmothers feel when they recognize an economy that can save a life without calling attention to itself.\n\nThere are weeks when a city only touches your shoulder as it passes, and there are weeks when it taps your forehead with fervor and insists you wake up into a different arrangement. Wednesday was a tapper. A man from the supplier in Mussafah called with the voice of someone who had misplaced his dignity under a pile of invoices and said, almost sheepishly, that the regulator that was like the others but not quite like the others\u2014the one Farid had wanted as a backup for a backup\u2014had been \u201cmiscounted into a truck\u201d and now sat on a shelf in a warehouse with a lock whose key had gone to Al Ain in a pocket with other keys. Soraya closed her eyes like a person hearing a joke that wasn\u2019t funny yet and then said they would drive, because there were days when you stepped into your own inconvenience and made it small by moving through it. Nour grabbed her bag with the wrench she loved and the bread she\u2019d stolen from Soraya that morning in case the world punished her for greedy sweets, and told Arif, who lifted two fingers in a blessing disguised as a insult and said if they brought back the wrong metal he would make them eat it.\n\nThe drive toward Al Ain at dusk peeled the day into long strips of color that clung to the road\u2019s edge. Trucks hunched in the slow lane like animals who knew better than to challenge a predator. Soraya drove with the patience of a person who had learned to carry two speeds in her skull: the one the car did and the one her blood preferred. They spoke of nothing for long stretches because silence sometimes did the kindness of believing you after you\u2019ve lied all day. Then, as if a switch had been hit by a toe under a table, Soraya asked in a voice that was trying to be casual and could not, \u201cDo you think my love of this is a good enough reason to build my life around it. Sometimes I am afraid that that is the poorest argument and the richest too.\u201d\n\nNour let the words rattle around her ribs, watched their shapes against her breath. \u201cI think love is a terrible reason until it is the only one that holds when every other reason leaves the room,\u201d she said, choosing them slowly because careless words in a moving car could do as much damage as careless hands. \u201cI think we pretend we want better reasons because wanting is dangerous in public. If you told the dean you wanted your name on a plaque he would respect you more than if you told him you want heat to do what you tell it to for three seconds without breaking your heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlaques are for men with shoes that sound expensive in hallways,\u201d Soraya said, a laugh tapping the underside of her annoyance. \u201cI want three seconds because three seconds is a container I can fill. I have always liked containers I can fill.\u201d She took a hand off the wheel and flexed it, a habit that meant anxiety had tried on her bones and found them too tight. \u201cAlso, sometimes I ask myself if I am a bad person for wanting you and the rocket and not knowing whether wanting them together means I am pretending the universe will treat me gently because I deserve it. The universe,\u201d she added, as if she were arguing with a matriarch, \u201cdoes not give a fig about deserving.\u201d\n\nThe honesty landed like a tool dropping exactly where it should without pinching a finger. Nour looked at the road and then at Soraya\u2019s cheekbone where the dusk made a quiet lake, and felt the whole embarrassment of being alive and wanting things that did not come on a parts list. She did not reach for Soraya\u2019s hand because the car was a small room and the world a complicated country, and also because wanting with care was a skill she was newly committed to practicing. \u201cI do not know who the good people are,\u201d she said, which was true in more categories than just love. \u201cI know who the people with better safety protocols are. I know that when I want you and the rocket in the same sentence, I become more careful with my bolts. Maybe that is all the morality we can afford just now.\u201d\n\nThey found the gate with the borrowed key by way of a night guard who had invented his own bureaucracy and a smell of cardboard altered by fear. The regulator sat on a shelf like a complicated fruit, quiet and almost apologetic. Soraya carried it to the car with two hands as if it were a child she had not told she was leaving with, and Nour opened the door for it like a grandmother who had decided to be ceremonial. On the way back, a camel drifted across the road with the dignity of a ship. Soraya braked as if they had rehearsed it, hands steady, words blasphemous and loving, and the camel looked at them with a straight-on disdain Nour wished she could cultivate and then moved on as if it had accepted their apology for existing.\n\nIn the lab the next day, the regulator nestled into its seat with an obedience that made everyone distrust it just enough. Farid hovered with a caliper and the look of a man who had already composed an apology he would not need to give. Maryam watched the door, because someone always has to watch the door when ten hands are near the hot thing. Habib told a story about the last time a man brought him a part with paperwork so long he had to read it while stirring his tea so it wouldn\u2019t get lonely. Soraya and Nour worked shoulder to shoulder without touching shoulders, a dance that was beginning to feel like its own language. When it was done, when the numbers on the laptop didn\u2019t make any emergency shapes and the smallest sound in the room came from the cheap clock on the wall which had always thought it was a metronome in an orchestra, Soraya said, \u201cMy mother wanted me to be a dentist because she thought mouths were more cooperative than machines,\u201d and Nour said, \u201cMouths lie more,\u201d and Habib said, \u201cMachines lie too, they just don\u2019t pretend it\u2019s a favor.\u201d\n\nFriday put its hands on the city\u2019s shoulders and shook it gently back into a sense of order. The demonstration for the committee took place under a tent that believed in its responsibility to boss the air, which it did not. Men with ties and women with clipboards arranged themselves along a rope line like pearls deciding where to sit. There were children in this crowd too, and Nour felt the tug in her ribs she had begun to accept would simply be part of her whenever a small person\u2019s small hands got near noise. Farid ran through his bored mantra with religious fervor. Maryam placed extinguishers like punctuation marks. Soraya checked and checked and then pretended she was the kind of person who did not check so she could stand up straight and talk like a person who knows joy but has chose to be professional. Nour went around behind the stand to the small corner where the thin cable displayed its modest loyalty, and in the shade there found the boy with the striped shirt from the marina, his hair combed into good behavior, his eyes already picking apart the day for secrets.\n\n\u201cMy father said we came to see your baby rocket,\u201d he informed her without preamble. \u201cHe said if it cries we have to clap.\u201d His father, behind him, wore an expression of a man trying to be casual about believing in strangers. Nour knelt because the corner smelled like sand and opportunity. \u201cIt will not cry,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it cries we are going to give it a nap.\u201d The boy considered this with seriousness and then took from his pocket a crumbly biscuit which he examined and put back without offering. He looked at the stand and then at her. \u201cAre you afraid,\u201d he asked, with the cruelty innocence has when it lands exactly on the right question.\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d she said, because you could not make adults honest if you wouldn\u2019t practice on children. \u201cBut I am also in love with our obeyed equations and the way my friends\u2019 eyebrows can keep us alive.\u201d He nodded, satisfied with the cadence even if the content slid past him, as children\u2019s acceptance often operates more on music than meaning. He pointed to a dove on the edge of the tent pole and advised it not to be stupid in a whisper he thought only the bird could hear, then squeezed his father\u2019s hand in a quality of gratitude that made Nour look away until she could come back to the day without wanting to cry.\n\nThe ignition was a lesson in how well a body can be two things at once. The engine asserted its flame, the stand held its role, the tether stayed put because it had been asked sincerely, and the small cylinder kissed the air with a motion that was neither panic nor laziness. It hovered, a little, the way a prayer does in the moment before it becomes air, and then it settled with a small grateful thump, like someone sitting back down after remembering something they had forgotten on the stove. The crowd made the noise crowds make when they have witnessed a miracle they can explain to themselves later as an inevitability. Soraya\u2019s face opened briefly to a kind of happiness Nour had not seen since the small times when you convince bread to have the exact texture you wanted. Farid exhaled drama he hadn\u2019t wanted to inhale. Habib said okay aloud to a god nobody in particular believed in but everyone liked to thank when nothing burned.\n\nAfter, the committee members asked questions that skimmed the surface of competence like stones behaving. One of them, round and nervous and with a smile he couldn\u2019t control, asked Nour about the part she liked least in a combustion cycle, and she answered in a way that made his relief patent; he had expected jargon and got a sentence he could repeat later with pride. Another asked Soraya why this, why now, why here, and Soraya\u2019s answer made the words small economy and big horizon sit next to each other without fighting. The boy in the striped shirt clapped anyway, late and alone, and Nour marched her hands to join him.\n\nWhen the tent folded, when the photographs were done and the flattery had been distributed in measured spoons, Nour went home and napped the way people in her family napped: with thirty minutes of sincerity. She woke to her mother\u2019s hand on her ankle, the soft squeeze intended to return her to a body before the brain took liberties. \u201cDinner,\u201d her mother announced, \u201cis a story about an aubergine that wanted to be smoke and then remembered it is also a fruit.\u201d They ate barefoot in the small living room where the rug resented the weather and pretended it was a different season. The TV narrated a match; the commentator sounded like a man who could guide a rocket through turbulence with sheer linguistic force. Midway through the meal, her mother glanced at her over the rim of a glass of water and said, without the preliminary negotiation she usually requires, \u201cYour father used to be afraid of balconies.\u201d\n\nThe sentence sounded like the first line of a book Nour would buy. She put the spoon down and waited because the story needed its legs to move by themselves. Her mother considered the window and the city\u2019s edge snipped out of it. \u201cHe was not afraid when anyone else was looking,\u201d she continued, picking aubergine skin from her teeth with a nail she had always meant to stop using for such work. \u201cHe would smoke like a movie star and make jokes about the men in the next building who could never find the right football channel. But when the house was quiet he closed the door because he had dreams where the balcony misbehaved. He never told anyone except me, and I only tell you because you tell me your ducks have learned to behave and I am proud of you and I am also not proud of myself for making jokes about you being afraid when perhaps you inherited something and made it into art.\u201d\n\nNour took that like a pill that was also a perfume. She wanted to close her eyes because the softness of her mother when she admitted failure was a rare metal. \u201cHis fear,\u201d she said, tasting it. \u201cHe wore it differently.\u201d Her mother nodded, agreeing with a sentence only mothers get to approve. \u201cHe wore it like a shirt under the shirt,\u201d she said. \u201cHe taught you to love bolts because bolts keep things attached to the world. He taught you to look at edges. He taught you\u2014maybe without wanting to\u2014to knock the doorframe before you go through it. I want you to keep the parts he meant to give you and forgive the ones he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Kareem sent a message that he was going to Sharjah for a month to make sure a team that did not trust him would learn to pretend to, and he asked whether she might come to see the yard before he left. She went, because the yard had rust and metal and stories that did not require formality. They walked between old engines like tourists in an ancient city. He told her the history of a coupling with the reverence of a man speaking about family, and she listened, not because she felt obligated to but because he had learned to render his expertise without making it a weapon. At the end of the walk, he stood near a derail and did a brave thing; he told her straight that he liked the way she sat inside her life and that he thought he had the hunger to sit with her there, but that he would not ask her to break any part to make room for him and he would not pretend to be unafraid of women who did not need saving. She liked him the way a well-made key likes an honest lock. She told him she didn\u2019t know\u2014about the part where love made a shape in her that would accommodate both rocket and Kareem, about the part where wanting Soraya didn\u2019t fit cleanly into any of her mother\u2019s categories or her own\u2014and he smiled and said the trains would be waiting, which was both a joke and a mercy.\n\nMina\u2019s studio smelled of orange peel and the kind of quiet that only exists in rooms where you recognize the furniture and the furniture recognizes you. Nour lay down and told the ceiling in a voice that tried to be bored that ducks had learned not to dim the room and that today the fear wore different clothes and maybe asked to be called by a more expensive name, like uncertainty or longing. Mina, who wore patience like a cardigan, moved her hands through the air with the seriousness some people reserve for bank transfers and said the thing that felt like a tool you could put into your pocket and take to a machine: \u201cYou can give two loves different chairs and teach them to nod politely when the other speaks.\u201d It wasn\u2019t an answer. Answers were for forms. It was a choreography and it would have to be enough.\n\nThe next time they went out to the desert, they brought fewer jokes and more water. Liwa had shifted again; dunes are worse than men for thinking they can decide what looks good without consulting anyone. Farid walked the line of the intended flight like a priest deciding where to put the sacrificial goat. Habib greeted his cousin with the complicated softness of Bedouin hospitality and the relief of a man who\u2019d been forgiven a debt he hadn\u2019t incurred. Soraya whistled tunelessly and then apologized to the wind for trying to conduct it. Nour had brought the glove from the box and fitted it like a new word. They did their checks and then did them again because the air was thick and people get sloppy when a place insists on showing off its beauty. The ignition lacked drama, which was in itself a kind of drama; the machine did as instructed, and the tetherless lift\u2014still small, still the length of a breath held and then let go\u2014didn\u2019t pretend to be more than a start. Nour felt the ache of that modesty in her bones. She wanted the big leap, the long sentence. She had learned to love commas.\n\nAfter, the men sat in the scrap of shade and admired the color of the sand as if it were a new suit on an old friend. Maryam lectured briefly on hydration and told a story about a man who had almost been saved by a bottle of water he had been too proud to accept, and everyone nodded because a little shame kept most people civilized. Farid announced, almost begrudgingly, that he was satisfied for now, which made Soraya lean over and draw eyebrows on the back of his hand with a pen. Habib\u2019s cousin yelled at a camel with the affection in his voice tight as a scarf. Nour tilted her head back and watched a bird make a line she could not calculate and felt, for a long moment that felt like a break in the day\u2019s spine, that she had arrived in a life that was listening. She let the feeling sit there without breathing on it too hard.\n\nIn the days that followed, the city resumed its argument with itself about being a machine or an animal. A new sign appeared by the Corniche with a picture of a duck inside a red circle and an explanation about disease and mess and municipal dignity, and Nour laughed once, softly, alone, and then took a picture and sent it to the boy\u2019s father with a note that read, \u201cWe will obey\u2014tell him to give his speeches to the wind.\u201d Laila made them disassemble a braking system twice because the first time they were smug and the second they were just right. Arif negotiated with a supplier who wanted to be paid in favors and was denied, with interest. Bassam got engaged and walked around the workshop like a man who had remembered where he\u2019d put his heart and was embarrassed by how dusty it had gotten. Her mother bought a dress and then decided not to wear it because the woman in the mirror looked like someone else whom she did not trust, and Nour told her she looked like a victory and did not lie.\n\nOne evening, when the heat did not want to unclench its grip, Nour opened the small metal box her father had once called his bank and found inside a receipt for a set of wrenches bought the week she was born, the ink bleached to polite gray. On the backside, in his chaotic handwriting that had convinced teachers to be kind, he had written the names of his daughters and the date he had learned how to quiet a radiator without replacing it. The combination of their two names and a trick felt like a poem he hadn\u2019t known he wrote. She took a photograph and sent it to her sister in Sharjah, who sent in return a picture of a sun hat and three children eating popsicles badly, and Nour filed the receipt back into the bank because she liked the idea of a past that sometimes earns interest too.\n\nWhen the next week\u2019s plan sprouted on the whiteboard, Soraya wrote \u201cliwa long\u201d and then erased \u201clong\u201d because she had learned that length is not a favor the world grants you because you have been good. She replaced it with \u201cclean,\u201d which Farid underlined without sarcasm. They would go earlier, they would bring a bigger tent, they would not invite the man with his niece who liked pink, they would feed themselves before they forgot and then tried to substitute sugar for a meal. Nour looked at the list and saw the shape of her days, the hard and soft, the way the city put its mouth to her ear and told her things she would not write down but would use. She sent a message to Kareem wishing him more trains than delays and he sent back a photograph of a nameplate on a carriage that read \u201cpatience,\u201d because someone in a paint shop had gotten a little poetic. She told Mina she had kept her fear in one room all week and Mina wrote, \u201cInvite it for tea sometimes or it will scratch the door,\u201d which felt rude and correct. She tucked her father\u2019s receipt into the pocket of her bag, a ritual that was less superstition than agreement with her own heart that sometimes paper could be a friend.\n\nOn the last night before they were to leave again for the dunes, after she had put the bread into a bag and checked the torque wrench twice and plugged in her phone as if she could charge the day ahead like a battery, Nour stood at the small balcony and watched a bulbul fixing its hair in the reflection of the glass. The city spread itself, glittering, and the wind skimmed a hand across the tops of the palms like a person walking down a hallway touching every door. Her mother came out with two cups of tea and a rumour about someone\u2019s cousin\u2019s daughter who had married a man in Al Ain who didn\u2019t deserve her and improved his life anyway. They drank quietly. Somewhere a boy dribbled a basketball badly and someone\u2019s laugh made a ladder up a stairwell. Nour thought of the first duck and the latest flame, of the boy\u2019s diplomacy on the dock and the security guard\u2019s crooked mea culpa, of Soraya\u2019s careful light and Farid\u2019s fussy love, of Habib\u2019s desert patience and Maryam\u2019s no-nonsense tenderness, of Laila\u2019s braid and Mina\u2019s fountain, of her mother\u2019s old battles and her father\u2019s secret balconies. She stood in the chain of all that and felt the weight of it, then the balance, and let the night close around her not as a corridor but as a courtyard where everyone knew which chair was theirs and could swap if someone came late and wanted to sit.",

                              "content": "The day the duck wandered into the workshop on M-15 in Mussafah, there was already a heat haze over the asphalt that made the buildings seem to tremble. Nour had been under the chassis of a Nissan Patrol with the ratcheting wrench clacking in a rhythm she could keep with her breath. Oil had soaked through the knees of her overalls, the stripes of grime on her wrists matching the blackened crescents under her nails. Somewhere outside, someone was playing a pop song too loud from an open pickup, the bass thudding like a nearby generator. The air smelled of rubber and the sweetness of leaked coolant, and the voices of men rose and fell around her, bantering, arguing, speculating about a weekend barbecue on the beach.\n\n\u201cNour,\u201d called Bassam from the office door, \u201cyou see this? Your cousin brought lunch.\u201d\n\nHe meant the delivery guy who always stood just outside the threshold to keep from tracking sand over the painted floor, the one who liked to tell everyone he was related to them. She slid out from beneath the car on her creeper, wiped her forehead with the back of her hand, and squinted into the brightness. When she sat up, the shadow moved. It wasn't the shadow that startled her\u2014not really. It was the shape within the shadow, tottering, the sound of webbed feet on concrete, the quizzical tilt of a head.\n\nThe duck had a patchwork of white and mottled brown on its back, and a beak that looked rubbery, almost playful. It waddled straight through the gap in the partially open roll-up door like a shopper who had taken a wrong turn in a mall, sniffing the air with what might have been suspicion. It was absurd in the middle of tool chests and compressors, as out of place as a violin at a drag race.\n\n\u201cI told you people to keep the doors closed,\u201d scolded Arif, the owner, but he was grinning. \u201cHe thinks we\u2019re a lake.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a she,\u201d said Bassam authoritatively. \u201cYou can tell by the\u2014by the\u2026 um.\u201d\n\nThe duck came closer, peering at a coil of hose, nibbling at nothing. Nour knew ducks\u2014the way a child knows them, by the way they looked in picture books and at the park near the Corniche. They were part of the peaceful vocabulary of water and grass. But here it seemed wrong, their presence borrowed from a green place and set into metal. Something in her stiffened.\n\n\u201cShoo,\u201d said Arif, flapping his hands. The duck stopped, blinked, and then as if horrified by Arif\u2019s flapping, begin to flap in turn. Its wings beat the air. In an instant there was a blur of feathers, a machine of them, and a shrieking sound that surprised everyone. The first wing beat knocked a plastic tray off a workbench; sockets rattled and scattered, rolling like coins. The wind of it hit Nour in the face and she jerked back, banged her head against the undercarriage of the Patrol, cursed, and saw feathers snowing in the air beneath the harsh fluorescent lights.\n\n\u201cClose the door!\u201d someone yelled.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t close the door,\u201d someone else said, \u201cwhat if it gets stuck inside?\u201d\n\nThe duck wheeled, and in its panic it did what panicked creatures do: it became bigger than itself. It filled the room. Nour scrambled backward on the concrete, the heel of her boot catching on the creeper, her hip slipping, the wrench clanging away. A wing beat near her ear, close enough that the vanes brushed her cheek, soft and crisp at once. The smell\u2014she\u2019d never noticed that smell\u2014wet straw and something sharp. She threw her arms up to protect her face. A ridiculous thought cut through everything: it could peck out my eye. It could peck at the soft part just below the eye where there is no bone. And for a spun-out second the world did tilting in a way she didn\u2019t recognize, the sound of the wingbeats becoming a ceiling fan turned to maximum in a room without windows, the light too bright, the floor not level.\n\nThen Bassam got the door open all the way and the duck flung itself toward the glare, out and away with a final commentary of quacks that sounded like laughter. The air settled. Feathers drifted down, soft as receipts. Tools were gathered. Someone made a joke about roast duck this evening; someone else joked about omens. Nour sat on the concrete with her knees up and her hands over her ears, breathing. She pried her hands away with care as though they were stuck with glue. When she stood, the blood rushed out of her head and then back in with a wave that made her sway. Her cheek felt warm where the feather had brushed it. It could have been the heat.\n\nArif handed her a bottle of water without looking at her too closely. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d she said, and was annoyed at the thinness of her voice. \u201cJust surprised me, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nBassam peered at her face. \u201cYou\u2019re a little pale.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always pale,\u201d she said, which wasn\u2019t true. She had her mother\u2019s brown, and the sun laid another layer of it on top. She took a long drink and then went back under the car because she did not want to have a conversation. The ratchet clicked: that was what she trusted, simple mechanics, the way torque delivered its argument through your forearm. The duck was a glitch in the system, the same way an alarm that goes off for no reason in the middle of the night is a glitch. You fix the glitch and you don\u2019t make it a story.\n\nExcept it became a story.\n\nWhen Nour went home that night to the apartment in Al Nahyan where the elevator always stopped one floor too high, her mother was on the phone to an aunt, the TV was on low to a Turkish drama, and the smell of cardamom drifted from the kitchen where rice was cooling. Nour kicked off her boots at the door and tried to make her entrance the way she always did, with normal weight, not collapsing.\n\n\u201cAlhamdulillah,\u201d her mother said, planting a kiss on her temple. \u201cHow was your day? Your hair smells like the workshop.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had a visitor,\u201d said Nour, and she should have stopped there but she was tired and just the tiniest bit amused at how ridiculous the truth was. \u201cA duck.\u201d\n\nHer mother\u2019s eyebrows went up as if someone had pulled them on strings. \u201cFrom where?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mangroves, probably. Or someone\u2019s farm. It came right in.\u201d Which was much safer than saying: It came for me.\n\nHer mother laughed; the aunt\u2019s voice on speakerphone wanted to know what this duck looked like; her mother held the phone to Nour\u2019s ear and demanded that she tell the story again but funnier. Nour studied the kitchen tile, the little chips in it that had been there since they moved in. She made her voice light. She said, \u201cIt was big and stupid and Arif was afraid to touch it,\u201d and listened to the aunt\u2019s shrieking laughter and thought, good, this is a story, we have placed it in the category of stories, we will not carry it into sleep.\n\nBut sleep is a place that doesn\u2019t always care for categories. When she closed her eyes, she saw wings and could not tell if they were bird wings or the tilting blades of ceiling fans. She woke at two in the morning with the sound of quacking so present that she walked to the kitchen to look out of the window to the concrete below, as if the duck had followed her home up seven flights. There was nothing there but a boy on a bicycle cutting a shadow across the streetlights. She went back to bed embarrassed by her own ribs heaving.\n\nThe next week, Nour found that she walked faster along the Corniche when her friends invited her to meet them after work. She did not look at the water where it peeled itself like silk and lay down again across the sand. She didn\u2019t want to see anything gliding. When a child fed a pale slice of bread to a gaggle of ducks in the park and the little animals surged forward with their pretty greed, she crossed the street, and told herself, Why not, why not, it\u2019s hot, I\u2019ll get a drink. She stood in line and ordered lemonade and forgot to add sugar and drank it anyway.\n\nAt work, the story traveled. It was Bassam who told Tariq from the shop two doors down, and Tariq told his cousin who worked at the tire place across the road, and by the end of the day, the security guard at the gate said, \u201cSister Nour, you should be careful\u2014if a duck bites you, you will quack forever.\u201d He was so pleased with himself he clapped his hands together. She smiled, because he was kind and she was, most of the time, kind, too.\n\nA week later, a contractor who brought in an engine with a bad head gasket looked Nour up and down with the expression of someone testing the weight of a new tool in his hand. \u201cYou are the duck girl?\u201d he asked. He was not unkind. He was just amused by a detail he\u2019d been given in a world of rusty details. She wanted to give him something sharper back, but she said, \u201cNo, I am the mechanic,\u201d and he shrugged and didn\u2019t say it again. The work is the work, she reminded herself. She loved the work. She loved the way a problem had layers, the way you could listen to an engine and be a doctor listening to a heart. She loved the click and the press, the way bolts sat in the mind like beads on a string.\n\nIf fear were an animal that left footprints, Nour would have followed it to its hiding place and coaxed it out. But fear leaves prints in the mind and spends the day licking them away. She hadn\u2019t been afraid of birds before that, not specifically. She had always laughed at her cousin Huda, who screamed at the sight of moths like they were ghosts. But now she felt\u2014ridiculous\u2014like there might be a duck in the office bathroom. The thought came to her at work in the middle of the morning, as she hung a pneumatic impact wrench back onto its hook. It was so embarrassing she flushed alone, told no one. On her day off she took a taxi to Eastern Mangroves and decided that she would walk, that she would look at the birds there and be fine; she would stand on the boardwalk and be the calmest person in Abu Dhabi. She walked for ten minutes and turned around, a cartoon of a person walking toward a thing and then away. A duck had looked at her. That's all that happened. It saw her and it knew she was a new thing too.\n\nNot everyone was generous.\n\n\u201cGrown woman,\u201d sniffed Arif one afternoon when the story came back again, long after the feathers had been swept. He was not mean. He was a practical man with practical eyes. \u201cAll kinds of people have jobs they can\u2019t do; one time a crane operator came to me with a headache so bad he cried. This is just a duck.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrother,\u201d said Bassam, who was younger and loved to philosophize because he had not yet found the weight of his own failures, \u201cyou are too serious. One day a duck will return as your teacher.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I will offer it a coffee,\u201d said Arif, and looked at Nour, not unkind. \u201cYou are okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m finishing the Saab this afternoon,\u201d said Nour, because she hated the way the question felt in her chest. The Saab had an electrical ghost, a drain on the battery somewhere nobody could find, and her hands were the hands for this job: careful, patient, not wanting to smash anything with a hammer.\n\nShe had another life too, in the evenings, the one her family celebrated while they disapproved of it: night classes at the university, the campus where palm trees lined wide promenades and students sat on fat beanbags and argued about nothing with the fervor of philosophers. Nour had started taking classes years ago because she was curious in a direction that felt like falling. Machines led to physics; physics led to space; space led to something that tasted like a poem. Her mother told her, \u201cMaktoub, whatever is written for you will come,\u201d and then also, \u201cYou should get married by thirty,\u201d and then also, \u201cOh, my heart is proud,\u201d and all of these were true at once.\n\nThe tutor she loved the most did not love her back, not in that way. He was not even a he. She was a woman with hair like a sheet of straight iron, glasses she took on and off with an intentionality that made her seem like she was cutting cloth. Her name was Soraya Haddad. She had an undercurrent of Damascus in her emphatic syllables, and her laugh was a tick of sudden silver. She taught a course with a name that was a mouthful\u2014Applied Fabrication for Aerospace Prototypes\u2014which in practice meant that they built small things that wanted to fly and measured why they didn\u2019t. Nour was good at it. She knew how to build and she knew how to ask the kind of questions that made Soraya\u2019s glasses flash.\n\nThe evening after the duck incident, Nour arrived at class with a bruise on her temple from the Patrol and an apology ready for nothing in particular. Soraya looked up from the lab table where she was arranging hardware. \u201cYou look like you fought the underside of a car and the car won,\u201d she said cheerfully.\n\n\u201cIt was a draw,\u201d Nour said. She took her seat and let the classroom wrap itself around her with its familiar rattles and lights and stale air conditioning. On the whiteboard, Soraya had drawn a cylinder and an arrow and the words thrust and mass flow rate.\n\nSoraya tapped the diagram. \u201cWe spend a lot of time pretending rockets are magic. Call them what you like\u2014vehicles, ships, arrows\u2014but in the end they are machines obeying equations. They don\u2019t get to choose, and neither do we, mostly. But there is play.\u201d She grinned. \u201cTonight I\u2019m going to show you something a little stupid and a little glorious. Don\u2019t tell the dean.\u201d\n\nFrom her bag she produced a small thing the size of her forearm, smooth and white like something that had tried to be a fish and failed. It had fins like a dart. It looked like a toy if a toy had been asked to sit up straight and be serious. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do a static fire,\u201d she said. \u201cJust for a few seconds.\u201d\n\nThe room vibrated with that thrill that goes through people who have decided to believe in something. Nour felt other parts of herself settle. She forgot the duck as if it were a scene in a play she left at intermission. She asked, \u201cWhere?\u201d and Soraya wrinkled her nose.\n\n\u201cOut beyond the bypass. There\u2019s a place a friend uses for testing. Late. We won\u2019t tell anyone. Bring a fire extinguisher and your sense of joy.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot safe,\u201d someone muttered.\n\n\u201cSafety is a word that keeps our mothers sleeping,\u201d Soraya said. \u201cWe will bring a big extinguisher.\u201d\n\nAfter class, Nour stayed. She always did. She couldn\u2019t keep herself away from the feeling of being alone with a teacher, like being alone with a language. Scattered across the table were fins cut from aluminum, tube sections, wires, a laptop with numbers that meant something like spells. Soraya moved around the table, efficient. \u201cHow was your day?\u201d she asked, as if they were already friends.\n\n\u201cA bird came into the workshop,\u201d Nour said without meaning to. \u201cA duck.\u201d\n\nSoraya paused, turned, and blinked. For a moment she tried to put that picture into her real. Then she laughed softly. \u201cIt\u2019s too hot. Even the birds want air conditioning.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt panicked.\u201d Nour heard her own voice go thin and felt the warmth of embarrassment. \u201cI panicked.\u201d\n\nSoraya\u2019s laugh faded. Her face made a careful shape. \u201cSometimes panic finds you. If you make it a home, it will move in.\u201d\n\nNour nodded, because this seemed like wisdom, even as she wanted to roll her eyes at the structure of sentences that sounded like they belonged in a book. She wanted to say: No, I am not a person who collects panics. She looked at the parts on the table and thought: Make this, and the other thing will go away. She said, \u201cYou\u2019re building a rocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are building a rocket,\u201d Soraya said, and Nour felt the clean weight of the pronoun settle in her body. A line that tied the afternoon to the evening.\n\nThe first time she had ever held a piece of a rocket, she had been a girl with a dusty braid and greased palms, standing outside a warehouse where a man in a pale shirt had told her that space belonged to those with perfect math, and she had laughed in his face because she did not yet know that people were serious when they lied to you like that. She had liked the ring of the aluminum under her knuckles. She liked this ring too, now: the metal cool and pretending it would always be this cool. She liked that Soraya said \u201cwe.\u201d\n\nThey drove out past midnight, a convoy of two cars, and the city slid behind them like a curtain being pulled closed. The roads glittered with the currency of sodium lights. Nour sat in the passenger seat of Soraya\u2019s car with a fire extinguisher between her knees and a bag of bolts at her feet. Her phone showed messages from family going to bed and friends going out and a group chat sending fifty pictures of the same cat. She muted everything. Soraya hummed under her breath as if she were coaxing the road to be shorter.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Soraya said suddenly, like a confession, \u201cI wanted to be a dancer when I was little. An impossible thing. Or a baker.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wanted to be many things,\u201d said Nour. \u201cThat\u2019s heavy.\u201d\n\nSoraya smirked. \u201cI became an engineer by mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou love your mistake,\u201d Nour said without thinking.\n\nSoraya glanced at her swiftly, then returned her eyes to the road. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d\n\nOn the outskirts they turned onto a road that wasn\u2019t sure if it wanted to be asphalt or sand. Timbers lay scattered among scrub. In the distance, a cluster of industrial buildings squatted like patient animals. Soraya pulled into a gravel lot where someone had plunked down a rusting shipping container and a makeshift test stand built out of steel that had already learned to bake. A man with a baseball cap and a camel\u2019s patience lifted a hand in greeting. \u201cThis is Habib,\u201d Soraya said. \u201cHe is good. He is also very strict.\u201d\n\nHabib handed them a pair of ear protection muffs like a father handing children their shoes. He said little. He showed them the braces of the test stand, the mounts where the small engine would sit. He had a face lined the way dunes are lined. The stars above them felt close enough for instruments.\n\nNour helped. She lifted the small motor into place as if it were a holy thing. She tightened bolts, checked washers, clipped a safety line she would have written a love letter to if anyone were reading. Soraya\u2019s hair had escaped its clip and caught the moon. They moved like they had moved a hundred times, which they had not, but the body can pretend it remembers what it wants.\n\n\u201cReady,\u201d said Habib. \u201cWe\u2019re only going to light it for two seconds.\u201d He counted them as if they were coins.\n\nAt the ignition, the world preheated. The little engine answered and for a heartbeat Nour understood why people give up everything to make big engines answer. The sound cracked the night and the smell of burned propellant crawled into her lungs and got comfortable. It was small, ridiculous, and there was nowhere in the world she wanted to be more than there. She was laughing by the time it shut down, the kind of laugh that swallows itself. Soraya grabbed her shoulders and shook her and the three of them\u2014Habib too\u2014grinned like idiots.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Nour asked after the silence returned. \u201cWhy does this feel like washing your face in cold water when you didn\u2019t know you were tired?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause in this moment everything does what it is supposed to do,\u201d Soraya said, and then snorted at her own pretension. \u201cBecause we\u2019re boring and love obeyed equations.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you forgot the duck,\u201d said Nour, and then pressed a hand to her mouth like she\u2019d spoken a secret. Soraya looked at her with bright interest, the way you look at a specimen under a microscope and like it.\n\nThe fear slept for a night after that. Nour woke with a small bruise of joy under her sternum and a whisper in her pocket that said we we we. But fear is a careful animal, good at building nests in the part of the mind that collects receipts. It waits where it knows you will find it.\n\nA week later, a client asked her to come out to a private villa on Yas because his boat lift wasn't working, and when something breaks near water, people call the mechanic who thinks like an engine. Nour arrived at dusk, the air a humid fist. The villa faced a channel where water slid past quietly, and on the little terrace someone had set up sun chairs no one had ever used. The boat lift was broken by a simple thing: a control box with a corrosion problem and a wire that had given up. She could fix it with patience and the right tools. She had both.\n\nAs she knelt by the control box, a sound came from the water. The quiet quack of a duck like a polite throat clearing. She froze. It was nothing. It was behind her. She tried not to turn because not turning would make it less real, but then she had to turn because she is a person who looks at problems. There were three of them drifting near the lift, their backs glossy in the last light. They regarded her as if she belonged.\n\nIt is a ridiculous thing to feel trapped on a dock with water on three sides and a closed gate on the fourth. The laugh caught in her throat like a pill. She kept working because the worst thing in the world would be to explain to the client that she had to leave because of birds. Her hands found the wire again as if the wire had newly formed. The ducks came closer because that is what ducks do; they are curious about the interesting serious organism that moves like food. One of them gave a little huff-sound, not quite a quack, like someone clearing their nose. Nour\u2019s heart beat a drum pattern that made no sense. She tasted metal. She felt her hands become something not hers. They were not unreliable\u2014they were absurdly reliable\u2014fast and small and good, and yet everything in the middle of her chest tried to climb out.\n\nThe client came out, a man who apologized for his life just by standing. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s, uh, the birds,\u201d he said, half laughing and half apologizing for laughing. \u201cThey\u2019re a little\u2014my kids feed them. Are you okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Nour said, and it sounded like a different woman had borrowed her mouth. She finished the job. The boat lift whined then didn\u2019t, then moved like it remembered how. The client was grateful. On the way back to her car, her knees shook as if she had run. When she got inside, she put her forehead on the steering wheel and did not cry because crying would leave lubrication tracks she didn\u2019t want to polish.\n\nThis is how stories harden. Someone says a thing. Someone repeats it. Then a colleague uses the story as shorthand for complicated things and the shorthand becomes the thing you are.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t send Nour to Yas,\u201d Bassam said to Arif one morning without malice, only practicality. \u201cThey have birds.\u201d\n\n\u201cSend her to our clients who like rockets,\u201d said Arif, which was the kind of joke that ate its own tail because there were no such clients. Nour took the ribbing until it irritated her skin. She wished it rolled off. It didn\u2019t. It stayed. She went home tired and watched videos of mechanical watch movements to calm down, the tiny tilting of polished gears like an orderly little city.\n\nThat\u2019s when she started looking at the flyer near the elevator that she had ignored for months. The flyer\u2019s soft colors were so out of place in their building where everything was beige and functional: blue wave shapes, a pair of hands drawn in outline above a torso. Reiki sessions, the flyer said, with a phone number and a name: Mina.\n\nNour had always minded the distance between the leaf and the poem about the leaf. She had not been the kind to submit to the invisible. She loved acuity. She loved wrenches. And yet. The fear had chosen something ridiculous and made it a law. Maybe she could answer it with something ridiculous too. She put her thumb on the phone number and then took it off and then put it back again. She did not call. Not yet. She took the flyer down and folded it and put it in her pocket like contraband.\n\nAt class that night, Soraya talked about burn rates and wall thickness. She drew numbers with the chalk that slid too quickly, her fingers ending up white. \u201cWe can try to be clever,\u201d she said, \u201cand sometimes we should be clever. But there is an amount of aluminum per second that must turn into hot gas. You cannot argue with that.\u201d\n\nAfter class, Nour stayed. Soraya was packing her things and humming something that might have been Fairuz but could also have been a football chant. \u201cWe\u2019re sending the test article to Al Khatm soon,\u201d she said. \u201cBigger burn. Will you come? I need your hands. Habib is going to bring his friend who is even stricter than he is. I\u2019m afraid of his eyebrows.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come,\u201d said Nour. The words came out like a promise she would keep even if the sky let go of her. She wanted to be caught up in something larger than fear. She wanted her hands to find a place where they were not merely instruments but critical.\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d Soraya snapped her bag closed. \u201cDo you ever write your name on the inside of your skull? To remind yourself where you are.\u201d\n\nNour laughed. \u201cYou say the strangest sentences.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet your face tells me you know. Nour,\u201d she said, letting her name be the light in its meaning, \u201cI am asking you something not as your tutor, okay? As a person. Is something wrong?\u201d\n\nNour opened her mouth to say no. She grew up in a family where no was the default to all prying. But Soraya\u2019s eyebrows\u2014the very ones she claimed to fear in others\u2014were attentive in a way that made no jokes. Nour released a breath she hadn\u2019t known she\u2019d been editing. \u201cI\u2019m having a stupid fear. It keeps\u2026 showing up like commercials. Ducks,\u201d she said, hating the way the word sounded like it had been made in a toy factory. \u201cIt\u2019s new. It makes me feel like I have a loose screw in my brain.\u201d\n\nSoraya considered. \u201cMaybe a screw. Maybe not. You know, in space, we ask: what are the worst-case scenarios? And then we tell ourselves we will survive them. This is not space. This is the Corniche, okay. But the question is the same. What is the worst? You see a duck. You freeze. You leave. Your friends will laugh at you. They will laugh until something else comes to make them forget they laughed. All the same: the body is not convinced by arguments. The body wants another body to teach it peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean,\u201d Nour asked, cautious.\n\n\u201cIt means anything from breathing exercises to someone putting a hand over your heart and saying, \u2018Okay, shukran, calm.\u2019 I have a friend who believes in shaking. She shakes like a dog after a bath and then wants to eat ice cream. It works for her.\u201d\n\n\u201cI found a flyer,\u201d Nour admitted as if she were giving Soraya a small badly folded map. \u201cReiki. Energy healing. My aunt will laugh until she is a skeleton.\u201d\n\nSoraya\u2019s mouth curved. \u201cAunts. I love them. Call if you want. Don\u2019t call if you don\u2019t want. But if someone offers you kindness and a room with a chair and time to be quiet, take it, and someone else can be skeptical on your behalf.\u201d\n\nNour put the flyer on the table between them. Blue wave shapes. Her own name felt heavy and useful in her chest. She knocked her knuckles against the tabletop, the old mechanic\u2019s way of blessing a thing.\n\nThere were fewer quiet rooms in the days that followed than she had imagined. Fear, once given a name, often takes it as permission to forward its CV to other departments. Nour declined a job because it was next to a fountain in a mall. She didn\u2019t say why. She took a job in the heat that nobody else wanted. She came home with burns on her fingers from a radiator cap that bit her and she held her hands under the kitchen tap and thought of how fast water cooled metal and then of other kinds of heat that didn\u2019t obey the same rules. She went with her mother to a distant cousin\u2019s engagement party and performed joy with sincerity. She watched Soraya make a joke with her eyes during class when a boy asked a question with his whole chest and the wrong equation. She stood with Habib in a patch of dirt and counted down to another little roar that made her bones clink in place.\n\nOnce, in between, she called the number on the flyer. A voice answered, slightly breathless as if it had been running. \u201cThis is Mina,\u201d the voice said. \u201cYou are looking for what?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Nour said and sat down where she was in the stairwell so her legs would not give up. \u201cI have a stupid fear. I have a normal life and a stupid fear and I want to turn it off or make it small.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can come,\u201d Mina said. \u201cYou can tell me about the fear and also we can close our mouths and let it be. We will not make it larger by measuring it too many times. Are you free Saturday?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d said Nour, surprising herself. She gave the time a shape. She repeated it in her head like a part number.\n\nOn Friday, after prayer, her mother said, \u201cYour aunt called me. She said she saw you near the university at midnight.\u201d\n\nNour picked up a date from the plate and rolled it in her fingers, sticky as a new truth. \u201cI help my teacher. We are making a\u2014small rocket.\u201d Calling it small made it easier to put into the kitchen.\n\nHer mother gave the date a skeptical look as if it were an accomplice. \u201cYour teacher must be very interesting.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is. She is also bossy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd does this rocket take you away from this planet where you still have to get married? Does it carry your chores into the sky like a balloon?\u201d\n\nNour placed the date in her mouth so she would not say what her first sentence wanted to be. She chewed. She smiled. \u201cMaybe if it is big enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou dream like your father,\u201d her mother said. It was not a compliment and it was not not a compliment. \u201cThere is a mechanic who came to look at the washing machine. He had a nice face. He could not fix the washing machine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen he doesn\u2019t have a nice face,\u201d Nour said. Her mother pretended not to smile. They have this dance. They will dance it until someone changes the music.\n\nOn Saturday, Nour went to a small studio above a shop that sold candles that smelled like forest and sea and sometimes laundry. The studio was white and had a shelf of potted plants that were all the same fake green. There was a chair and a table and a tiny fountain in a corner that made a sound like someone was sighing in a happy way. Mina was a woman with a profile that could have been cut out of paper. She took Nour\u2019s hand the way you might pick a fruit you didn\u2019t want to bruise. \u201cYou can tell me or not tell me,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes telling is a way of not feeling.\u201d\n\nNour shrugged with one shoulder. \u201cDucks,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are everywhere.\u201d\n\nMina\u2019s smile was small and not performing. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will not argue with the ducks. Will you lie down?\u201d\n\nNour lay down on a table that smelled like eucalyptus and laundry. Mina put her hands over Nour\u2019s eyes without touching them and then over her chest and then over her knees. It felt like being measured by temperature instead of by numbers. It felt like the part of praying that is not words. Minutes passed slowly, oddly. Nour found herself laughing, not out loud. She saw the duck in the workshop as if it were printed on slow paper. She saw the way her hands were good and the way they had not abandoned her. She thought of Soraya lifting an engine with her eyes. She thought of Habib\u2019s hands, a quiet clock of a man, and how he had said nothing and said everything. She thought of aluminum. She thought of the sound of water in the little fountain and did not think: river. She did not think: quack.\n\nWhen it was over, Mina said, \u201cIt is not magic. It is breathing where you never breathed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like tools,\u201d Nour said. She felt foolish and cleaned. \u201cWill you be offended if I say I want to like this too but I am still a ridiculous woman who will go back to her bolts.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo back,\u201d said Mina. \u201c Bring your bolts. Maybe the hands can speak to each other.\u201d\n\nNour handed over money that felt like buying medicine. She walked down the stairs and out into the evening where the light was polishing the edges of buildings and the traffic stalled like a lazy animal. She sat in her car and did not put her forehead on the steering wheel. She looked at her hands on her thighs. She texted Soraya: Friday Al Khatm still happening? Habib\u2019s scary friend coming?\n\nSoraya responded with a rocket emoji and then an eyebrow.\n\nOn Thursday night, in the workshop, Bassam asked, as if he had to ask, \u201cSo. How are you and the ducks,\u201d and the way he said it, singing, made the word into something else, a container for a different song.\n\n\u201cBusy,\u201d Nour said, dry. \u201cWe have a new group chat.\u201d\n\nHe laughed, and in his laughter even the story had a different shape, something you could hang a coat on instead of a chain. Arif came out rubbing his hands like a man about to sell something and said, \u201cWe have a job next week for a boat engine at the marina. Not Yas. The small one. If you want it.\u201d\n\nShe waited for her body to revolt, to throw tractors in the road of her brain. It didn\u2019t. It hesitated like a car at a roundabout and then entered. \u201cI do.\u201d\n\nArif nodded as if this were not interesting. Maybe it wasn\u2019t. Maybe it was ordinary to everybody except the person who had to do the deciding.\n\nThat night, Nour packed the fire extinguisher into the trunk of her car as if it were a person she liked doing a dangerous job. She put a box of tools next to it, ritualizing, the way someone might set a glass of water on a bedside table not because they are thirsty but because they might be thirsty. She thought of the rocket in pieces finding itself, and of her hands being asked to sign their names on it. She thought of the ducks as a wind that had blown into her house and out again, although the door was still open and could open again.\n\nAlong the Corniche, the wind picked up. You could not see it, only the way it toyed with the fringe of a woman\u2019s shawl and the fronds of a palm. In the water, something like a fish but not a fish turned and left a gentle signature. Nour stood in the scrambling air between machines and animals and people and other words we have for ourselves. A prayer floated over the city in the last light like the idea of order. The workshop lights were hot. The city held its breath for the night to blow through it.\n\nThere would be a rocket. There would be the old men and the young men and the women who looked like them and nothing like them. There would be jokes. There would be heat. There would be something that smelled like burned sugar. There would be a duck one day and also a day with no ducks. There would be a time when she asked a stranger to trust the way her hands settled a bolt into the mouth of an impossible thing. And the story that had hardened\u2014duck girl\u2014would soften and drip and run, and under it another story would be found because there always is, because we are always not only one thing, because on a day when it is too hot for birds and engines, the wind coming off the Gulf will still insist on telling you it has news.",

Cars queued at gas stations wearing a thin suede of sand, and everyone\u2019s voice on the phone sounded as if it had been rolled in cloth. Nour wiped the sill in the kitchen with the edge of her palm and then wiped her palm on her jeans, which made both worse. Her mother clucked at the wind with the authority of a woman who had outstared weather her whole life, and shoved a glass of laban into Nour\u2019s hand as if hydration could be armor. A pan of onions hissed; the TV murmured the news in that barely rising tone it used when telling you the city was inconvenienced, not endangered. When the open balcony door banged once and then again, her mother banged back as if to say, we invented this ritual.\n\n\u201cAl Khatm?\u201d her mother asked, wrinkling her nose like someone tasting milk that had leaned toward sour. \u201cNow? In a wind like this?\u201d\n\nNour tied her hair with a band she kept on her wrist and felt the elastic snap the tender skin there, a sharp reminder that she was present. \u201cWe\u2019ll see when we get there,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it\u2019s too bad we won\u2019t light it. The man with the eyebrows will say no.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay God bless the eyebrows,\u201d her mother said dryly, and reached up to straighten the collar of Nour\u2019s shirt because straightening was love. \u201cCome back when your bones are all still inside and send me a message every hour like a teenager. Take dates. Habibi, your face gets thin when you are with your rockets.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy face is a rocket,\u201d Nour said, and kissed her mother\u2019s cheek. The kiss was a punctuation mark they both knew how to give their sentences. She picked up the backpack with tools and the extinguisher handle cut into her fingers in the familiar way that was better than prayer beads. She would worry about the marina job later. She said it to herself like a promise she didn\u2019t fully believe, which made it stronger.\n\nOut on the street, the shamal pushed at her like an old aunt insisting she take a second serving. Sand hissed along the asphalt and made the world into a photographic negative, all bleached edges and soft outlines. The city wore different cheekbones in this light. She drove slowly, past the mosque where the dates on the trees hung heavy and powdered with dust, past boys on bicycles with scarves wrapped bandit-style over their mouths, past a cat shaped like a small god slinking beneath a car. At a red light, she watched wind spoon grit against a concrete wall and thought of Habib, his patience sand-shaped. She thought of Soraya\u2019s text at dawn\u2014still on, bring masks\u2014and the way her own heart had tightened between excitement and the sigh of relief that would come if the wind cancelled their intentions. It is a strange thing when both outcomes feel like gifts.\n\nSoraya\u2019s car was a gray smudge in the parking lot behind the lab, the grayness more flattering than it ever was. She was loading the small composite body onto foam blocks in the trunk, her movements compact, her hair pulled into a knot that had decided to be messy and elegant at the same time. She looked up with squinty eyes and a grin that had to fight the wind. \u201cWe\u2019re going to arrive with twenty percent sand added to our mass fraction,\u201d she yelled over the shush. \u201cHabib said it\u2019s better in the interior. The city makes wind meaner.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you need help?\u201d Nour asked, though she was already there with her hands under the rocket\u2019s weight. They fitted together around the thing as if it were a child they were separate parents to. Soraya\u2019s knuckles knocked against hers and they both flinched as if burned, then pretended they hadn\u2019t, because pretending is one of the tools people use when they give each other space.\n\nThey drove like people who have decided to go somewhere even if the road doesn\u2019t want them. The highway out of the city lay like a ribbon that had been left out in a sandstorm overnight, smooth and scuffed. The city\u2019s edges fell away; warehouses became low groves of ghaf; beyond that, the desert opened like a book that had been thumbed until the spine cracked. The wind wrote wavy light over the dunes and erased it at the same time. In Soraya\u2019s car, the air conditioner fought a noble losing battle and songs played low enough to be background texture. When trucks passed them, they shed their own weather like tall ships.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Soraya said after a long silence that held its own companionship, \u201cmy mother used to put wet towels over the windows when I was little. In Damascus, in the summer, when the dust from the construction sites would drift like a complaint. She would make the house a cave. My sister and I would build rockets out of toilet paper rolls and tape and throw them from the balcony to the courtyard and our neighbor would shout up at us like an Egyptian soap opera uncle. He had a parrot who knew three swear words.\u201d\n\nNour smiled, the smile a little sideways because images of birds still walked through her mind like they owned it and here was a parrot, invited calmly into speech. \u201cDid your rockets land anywhere good?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were loyal to gravity,\u201d Soraya said. \u201cThey landed on the laundry lines. Once they landed on a plate of sliced watermelon and my mother said, okay, that\u2019s enough, you\u2019ve touched the sacred.\u201d The smile tilted away, and for a breath she looked forward with eyes that were not a teacher\u2019s eyes and not a friend\u2019s, just eyes watching a road in a country they had chosen. \u201cI want to make one that lands where I ask it to,\u201d she added in a tone that was both practical and the hunger you hear in someone telling the truth.\n\n\u201cThen you will,\u201d Nour said, because in her world promises were how machines learned to behave. She turned the words in her mouth like a bolt to make sure they fit.\n\nAl Khatm was less wind and more heat. The dunes gathered in loose courtyards and cupped the air in warmer palms; the noise of the shamal weakened as if the desert were a grandmother who had set a finger gently on its lips. A small cluster of vehicles hunkered around a shipping container and the test stand, and Habib stood in the raw shade talking with a man whose eyebrows offered a thesis in severity. He saw them and lifted his hand; the other man turned and lifted his eyebrows like a gate.\n\n\u201cThis is Farid,\u201d Soraya said, with the faint teasing of someone who knew what jokes they could make and which would cause explosions. \u201cHe keeps us honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI keep your insurance company happy,\u201d Farid corrected, and his voice was not unkind. It had the flat patience of someone who had told hundreds of people to slow down with dignity. \u201cGoggles, masks, protocol. Wind is lower. We proceed at discretion. We cut if it misbehaves.\u201d\n\nNour liked him immediately and disliked him too, the way you might like and dislike a torque wrench that had been calibrated too perfectly. He had a clipboard, and on it, a list where each line was a small law. He shook Nour\u2019s hand in a way that tested his hypothesis about her grip and nodded afterward as if she had confirmed it. \u201cYou\u2019re Nour,\u201d he said, and his eyebrows relaxed half a degree. \u201cHabib says you check three times and then you check again because checking is a religion. We need that religion in the desert.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need ear protection,\u201d Habib added, with his small smile like a shadow. \u201cAnd water. I left it in the shade.\u201d\n\nSoraya unloaded with the economy of someone whose hands remembered the sequence. Nour felt the familiar calm begin to pile its neat bricks inside her chest. The rocket section they had built sat in the cradle on the stand like an obedient creature, nose sunned, fins quiet. Cables coiled in loops that would satisfy a monk. The camera on its tripod peered like an old aunt trying to hear. The sky bleached and then blued, and the wind whispered secrets none of them spoke. Nour worked through the list: bolts seated, clamps torqued, lines connected, igniter continuity confirmed. Her fingers did their little checks like prayer, counting touches instead of beads. She called each item out for Habib and Habib answered in his murmuring tessellations. Soraya hovered at the laptop making jokes that were guise and code.\n\n\u201cTelemetry,\u201d Farid said, pointing at the screen with one long finger like a sentence. \u201cCall out before you light. Mask up. You will only run for three seconds. Three seconds is an eternity if you are wrong.\u201d\n\nNour put on the ear muffs and her world muffled into a polite, cottony thing. She pulled the mask up and the smell of her own breath, warm and faintly sweet from dates, enclosed her. Her heart found its rabbit rhythm and then slowed because her hands told it to. She liked the language of rockets because it was just another dialect of the language of cars. Both wanted to go somewhere. Both needed to be convinced they weren\u2019t being asked to die. She stepped back to the line and glanced at Soraya, who was looking at her, not at the numbers, her eyes bright under the brim of a cap she had stolen from Habib. For a second, Nour let herself receive that look as a blessing.\n\n\u201cRange,\u201d Farid called, eyebrows in their quiescent sternness. \u201cRange is clear. Last call.\u201d\n\n\u201cClear,\u201d said Habib.\n\n\u201cClear,\u201d said Soraya. \u201cLighting on my mark.\u201d\n\nThey counted together and the counting became something that belonged to them all. On two, the wind shifted and the smell of hot sand came like a hand held over the mouth of a stove. On three, the engine woke and a small pillar of insistence lifted dust and light. The sound went through Nour and rearranged the furniture. The camera blinked. The stand did its job with the smugness of something doing exactly what it was designed to do. In the small cracking roar, there was a line thrown out to every machine she had ever touched, and she wanted to cheer but remembered she liked to be quiet when joy was happening so she could watch it better.\n\n\u201cCut,\u201d Soraya called, and cut it, and the air snapped back like elastic. Silence carried the tiny hiss that came after, cooling metal making minute decisions. Farid lowered his eyebrows, which was his version of a grin. Habib nodded like a man at a well saying, yes, yes, the water is sweet today.\n\n\u201cAgain,\u201d Soraya said, looking to Farid and then to Habib and finally to Nour as if asking the three corners that kept her stupid glory standing. \u201cData looks good. Pressure within range. We can do another. We will be greedy and then we will go home.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will be careful,\u201d Farid said. \u201cGreedy later. You have a leak in an attitude line,\u201d he added after a blink, pointing to the screen, and his voice did not change and neither did his eyebrows. \u201cPressure decay too rapid for this temperature.\u201d\n\nIt was not a leak. It was a hairline crack in the fitting, the kind that a person with sorcerer eyes might catch or a person who had been taught by bolts. Nour saw it because her hunger for such errors had been trained like a falcon. The fitting sat in shadow, and when she touched it, it shivered under her finger like something that wanted to confess. She pointed; Habib angled the light; Soraya made a sound that was half curse, half praise for the world being the way it reveals itself. Farid\u2019s eyebrows did that small movement again. He said nothing about their greed, because now it looked like caution dressed as greed.\n\n\u201cWe switch it,\u201d Habib said. \u201cYou brought the spares.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always bring the spares,\u201d Nour said, and hearing herself say it steadied her as if she had set down a plate that had started to tilt. She walked to the car and the wind hit her, and the dunes performed their ancient dance and a bird lifted from behind the shipping container where it had been sheltering, startled into air by her presence. It was not a duck. It was a dove the color of old letters, its small head committed to a line through the gusts. Still, her chest made its mountain and its valley. She paused and felt her hands open and close around the spare fitting and thought, breathe where you never breathed. In the shadow stretched by the container there was no fountain, only her shadow moving with her. She returned and the work swallowed her.\n\nSwapping the fitting was a lesson in humility and in ratios. Metal wants not to be torn. Threads want to be reintroduced with courtesy. In the corner of Nour\u2019s mind where Mina had put a soft chair, a woman sat and watched and did not comment. In the corner where Soraya stored phrases that were dangerously close to poems, a sentence scratched its back on her ribs and settled down. Farid hovered without hovering. Habib gave her the wrench when she needed it without a word because work can be a prayer said by two.\n\nThey lit again and the engine made a small column of joy that widened at the top like breath. The roar crawled into bones and put its feet up. Farid actually smiled, which looked like a different man borrowing his face. Soraya whooped and then covered her mouth because she preferred to be inappropriate with intention. Nour let herself grin as openly as a child in the moment when a kite stops trying to escape and learns the game. She looked up at the sky and the sky was not impressed or unimpressed; it had its errands. She was not asking it for anything in that second; she was simply here with heat and noise and the facts.\n\nWhen the heat settled and the smell drifted, they sat in the strip of shade with their bottles of water and their long exhale. Habib munched on something that looked like sunflower seeds and distributed them like a sultan in a modest fairytale. Farid took a picture of the stand and then looked embarrassed at himself and put his phone away. Soraya stretched her legs and made an exclamation of delight that was purely about the joy of being unfolded. A fly tried to establish a friendship with Nour\u2019s ankle and she flicked it away with a minimal foot gesture that contained a small theater of disgust.\n\n\u201cTell me something boring about yourself,\u201d Soraya said suddenly, pushing her sunglasses up into her hair and squinting with interest. \u201cNot the thing about the ducks. I know the ducks. Something really boring, like a professional boring.\u201d\n\n\u201cI watch videos of watch escapements when I can\u2019t sleep,\u201d Nour said, and it felt like opening a drawer to show someone the exact shirt you fold the same way every time. \u201cThe little clicks and forks. It makes my brain smooth. You?\u201d\n\n\u201cI bake bread on Sundays and then forget to eat it until Wednesday,\u201d Soraya said, and her mouth tilted with an embarrassed pride. \u201cIt goes stale with patience. Then I make crumbs. The crumbs become cutlets. The cutlets become friends with a salad I never remember to buy. My life is an ecosystem of intent and improvisation.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike rockets,\u201d Farid inserted, surprising them all with the ease of his line, and Habib laughed softly and nodded as if approving a small improvement in the shape of the world.\n\nThe drive back felt shorter because they carried the weight of a small success like a piece of paper with a grade on it you want to show someone. The wind had tired. The city rose up ahead, scabbed with construction and shining in places as if it had put lotion on. Soraya tapped the steering wheel with her thumbs in a rhythm Nour recognized from her own feet when she walked a hallway and there was music only she could hear. They spoke about the data and they spoke about Mina and neither of them said the word that tugged at their sentences because it did not belong in the car, not that afternoon, not with dust in their noses and the engine running the way an engine runs when it is not choosing to break.\n\nAt home, her mother held up the dish cloth, her eyebrows the older cousins of Farid\u2019s. \u201cYou are still in one piece,\u201d she noted. \u201cGod is generous with fools.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were very clever fools,\u201d Nour said, and smiled when her mother swatted the air near her to claim a victory for parental warnings. She took a shower and watched the day\u2019s grit go down the drain and felt odd affection for the line of clean skin appearing under her fingers like truth revealed.\n\nIn the morning, the marina air was a different kind of breath. It had the sweetness of rot that all water keeps as a souvenir and the upnote of gasoline that always made Nour think of ferry rides in Ajman when she was a child and someone had sneaked them to feed chips to gulls. The light off the fiberglass of boats made a festivity of glare, the palms along the walk wore their combed look, and somewhere a speaker was playing a ballad that wanted to be louder. She parked, smiled at the attendant who had learned all the mechanics\u2019 names and called them \u201cboss,\u201d and shouldered her toolbox with a shrug that rearranged muscles in a way that told them work was what it was.\n\nThe engine belonged to a man who loved his weekends the way some men love their god. He had the fitted polo and the fitted belly; he had the sunglasses that said he was always judging the sea and always finding it adequately blue. He showed her the boat with the flourish of a host leading someone to a guest room and did not make a joke about ducks, and for that he earned an extra ounce of her compassion. The engine itself was not complicated. It was a stubborn thing, salt-bitten, with an impeller that had chewed its last and a thermostat housing that needed a new gasket because water and heat had eloped and left mess. She set to work with the memory of yesterday\u2019s heat still somewhere in her bones, a pleasant residue that made her quick and deliberate.\n\nOn the water, ducks were minds with paddles. They loafed and then translated themselves. There were two near the breakwater and three by a boat where a little boy in a striped shirt held out bits of bread like offerings to shrugging gods. Nour inhaled and her body made the old preparation to flee its own shape, and then she exhaled and felt the part of her that was Mina\u2019s client sit down again and place its hands on its knees. She looked at the ducks as if they were equations with known solutions, not the kind that became proofs you could fall into. She identified them: one glossy-headed, two the mottled brown of practical dresses. She did not look at their eyes. She looked at the bolts.\n\nHalfway through, the boy wandered closer because machines are magnets for certain children. He was careful not to step on ropes, which told her his father had taught him something, and he crouched near where Nour\u2019s tools lay and watched with the serious face of a person learning a secret. The ducks followed his path as if attached by string.\n\n\u201cMy baba says engines are like camels,\u201d he announced, not looking at her, looking at the place her hands entered the world and changed it. \u201cYou have to ask them please.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour baba is correct,\u201d Nour said, and didn\u2019t turn because turning would make the ducks into something with edges. \u201cIf you don\u2019t ask nicely, they spit.\u201d\n\nThe boy snorted. He held up his handful of bread and squinted. \u201cDo you like ducks?\u201d\n\nNour set the housing down, wiped her gloves on a rag, and considered the strip of water catching light like broken glass. She did not want to lie to a child, even a little. \u201cI like the way their feathers look like something a painter made. I don\u2019t like when they forget that I am not bread.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should tell them,\u201d he said with the confidence of seven. \u201cMy mother tells me and I remember.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe you can tell them for me,\u201d she said, and that felt like the kind of asking for help she was learning how not to be ashamed of. \u201cTell them this woman is a mechanic. Tell them her fingers are not bread.\u201d\n\nHe marched to the edge of the dock and, with the authority of someone who has never doubted that animals listen, addressed the ducks. He used a voice with the cadence of his father\u2019s prayer and his teacher\u2019s reprimands and his cartoons\u2019 commands. The ducks backed away a little, confused by the sudden thunder. He returned, pleased, and examined her ratchet as if it were a pet. \u201cWhat does this do,\u201d he asked, and she showed him, and for a while the world contained only the click of gears and the way tiny complicated things turn when you ask them to.\n\nWhen the engine finally coughed and decided to live, the man in the sunglasses made the little boyish sound all men make when a machine agrees to belong to them. He tipped Nour extravagantly and then tried to tip her again when she refused the extravagance with polite gratitude. On the walk back to the parking lot, a duck crossed her path with the deliberation of a person who knows the rules of the street. Nour stopped, and the duck stopped, and they regarded one another like distant cousins at a wedding. She felt the old ridiculous trembling begin, and she felt the newer thing rise to meet it, the one that was a part held for her by other hands. It was not courtly peace and it was not war. It was an armistice signed in pencil.\n\nAt the workshop that afternoon, the air had decided to be thick rather than hot, the way a stew is thick rather than watery. Bassam had a headache and wore it like a hat. Arif argued with a supplier on the phone and hung up with a resigned flourish, the kind of flourish that says real victory is a myth. A man brought in a Land Cruiser that complained loudly and would not explain why. Nour\u2019s mother sent her a link to a photo of a cat with eyebrows. Soraya sent an image from the data run circled in red\u2014the kind of circle that says look, look, we did math and it listened. Mina texted her a single blue wave and Nour answered with a single wrench and then shook her head at herself before she liked that she had done it.\n\nIn the evening, the elevator surprised them by stopping at the correct floor and Nour\u2019s mother exclaimed as if the building had stamped her paper after making her wait in line for hours. There was fish for dinner, baked with lemons that had grown in someone else\u2019s yard. The news on TV was a parade of ministers visiting places and men in suits saying sentences that sounded as if they had been ironed. A neighbor knocked to ask for sugar and stayed to discuss the sudden rise in the price of the better kind of rice. After dishes, her mother said, in a tone that wanted to be casual and could not quite manage it, \u201cThere is a nice man, the cousin of the woman from our building whose daughter got into engineering. He is an engineer too. Electrical. He did a training in Germany. He visits his mother every Friday. We are invited tomorrow for tea. It is only tea. You can say no.\u201d\n\nNour carved a line in the condensation of her glass with her fingernail and watched the water reunite with itself. Somewhere inside her the duck tilted its head. Somewhere inside her the rocket counted down. \u201cTea is tea,\u201d she said, and smiled politely at the air. \u201cWe will go and obey the tea.\u201d\n\nHer mother nodded, both relieved and immediately pensive about her outfit. They sat together on the small balcony that looked over other small balconies and listened to the city unlace its day. A tangle of boys shouted about a goal in the dusty lot where they had painted a penalty line in their minds. The mosque sent its evening call out like a hand searching for a familiar shoulder. A woman watered a plant that had decided to live after dying three times. The wind had laid down, tired. In that peace, Nour thought about what she had chosen: to drag the ridiculous fear into rooms with rockets and men with eyebrows and little boys with striped shirts and a woman who placed her hands above her ribs and told her nothing and everything. She thought about being someone\u2019s wife, about the slimness of her knowledge of it, about the way work made a shape around her that she fit into and the way love might be a city she did not yet have the maps for.\n\nWhen she slept, she dreamed she was lying under the belly of the sky as if it were a car, the stars arranged like bolts at regular intervals, their heads shining. She reached up with her spanner and found each one and pressed, and in the quiet there was a flapping, but it was only her own breath moving through her, a kind of wing she had been carrying since she was born. In the dream, Soraya counted softly, and Habib said nothing, and Farid\u2019s eyebrows knit and unknit like an old woman\u2019s hands and Mina\u2019s palms hovered an inch above the dream of her heart, warming it without touching.\n\nThe next day the nice engineer with the Germany certificate had soft hands and a laugh that did not know it was trying to impress people. He asked her what she did and she said the words she always said and watched the small alarm cross his face and leave, like a bird realizing it had flown into the wrong room. He talked about voltage; he talked about trains. He did not ask about ducks. He did not make her feel like the wrong bolt for a thread. Her mother watched from the kitchen like a director who wanted a particular scene and was trying not to interfere with the actors. Nour drank tea, she offered dates, she made the correct jokes at the correct times, and she felt like she had cleaned out a drawer and stacked its contents in tidy rows even if she did not know yet where the drawer would go.\n\nAfter they left, after her aunt called to perform the autopsy of the tea with an enthusiasm unmatched by any doctor, after the dishes had been put away and the night done its slow tide thing, Nour sat at the small table with the form for a certification course open on her laptop. It would give her an extra stamp on her competence. It would cost money she could find. It would happen on Tuesday evenings when Soraya\u2019s class did not. She filled in her name with a small anxious pleasure, like aligning a bearing to a shaft and feeling it slide with that perfect, almost obscene smoothness. She sent the application into the night and leaned back and closed her eyes.\n\nA wingbeat sounded outside the window, and her body startled before her mind. She stood and opened the curtain with her fingers in that careful way she had learned from both rockets and reiki, mindful of not ripping the world. On the railing was no duck and no dove. There was a bulbul, stuttering its delicate call, head cocked, tail flicking like punctuation. It stared at its own reflection in the glass and decided to be brave. Nour watched it, and the watching did not carve her, and when it flew away, its absence was not a hole but a reminder that air knows how to hold what passes through it.\n\nLater, when she texted Soraya about the certification, the answer came swift. Proud of you, the message said, and then, as if the truth had slipped out and decided to stay, I like how your hands think. She stared at the words until their shape became just pixels and then back into words again. She wrote, We are going to need a better fitting for the oxidizer line, and she wrote, The ducks have a spokesperson now who is seven and very bossy, and she wrote, I will bring bread on Sunday if you make it and forget to eat it. She did not send all of these. She sent the first one, and then a minute later, the second, and left the third to sit in her drafts like a spare part she would keep in the box for now.\n\nAt dawn, the city polished its sky with pink and somebody\u2019s radio played a song about return. Nour woke before the alarm with a sentence in her chest that felt like a tool she hadn\u2019t used yet and would need. She did not know what job it would fit. She only knew it had weight and balance and that when she reached for it, it would be there. Outside, a boy on a bicycle cut a shadow across the streetlights going off in sequence, and the day rolled its shoulders as if about to lift something heavy and precious, knowing it could.",

                              "content": "By the time the certification class began to feel like a room she had always been entering, Nour had learned where the cold settled in the building and where the tea man left the paper cups when he was in a forgiving mood. The classroom was different from the lab with Soraya and different again from the workshop; it wore seriousness like a badge, posters laminated and slightly peeling at the corners instructing proper safety protocols with images of generic men in goggles. Most of the people were men who wore their competence on their shoulders and checked their phones under the table as if their thumbs were permitted to attend two classes at once. The instructor was a woman with hair that had given up being dyed and was magnificent in its decision, a braid thick as rope that she looped around itself like a knot in a dock line. Her name was Laila and she had worked in places Nour imagined in black and white: oil fields that smelled like banknotes, hangars where the roofs hummed with heat. She spoke without asking to be allowed, and when she said the word torque it seemed to land on the table with a satisfying weight.\n\n\u201cYour hands will save your life if your brain is lazy,\u201d she told them in a voice that was amused and grim at once. \u201cYour brain will save your job if your hands want to show off. It is a marriage. Let them counsel each other.\u201d She walked through the room and corrected a grip here, a posture there, and when she stopped by Nour, she nodded at the way Nour held the micrometer. \u201cWho taught you that,\u201d Laila asked softly, and when Nour said, \u201cBolts,\u201d Laila grinned and moved on. In the break, a young man with a shaved head asked Nour if she was the one from the workshop on M-15 that everyone said could \u201chear\u201d a battery drain. She shrugged like a person making nothing out of a small miracle and did not give him the story he wanted. Later, Laila pulled her aside with the ease of someone sliding a screwdriver under a lid. \u201cThe men will think you are a new tool,\u201d she said without pity, only accuracy. \u201cLet them. Tools are useful. Be a useful tool until you are a machine they depend on and cannot name.\u201d\n\nThe workshop felt heavier that week, not with heat\u2014though heat was always a cousin in the room\u2014but with work that wanted to be done and was not interested in narratives. A fleet order had come in from a construction company with half its pickups vibrating wrong and the other half complaining in languages Bassam could not translate. Arif stood in the office doorway and rubbed the back of his neck with the hand he used for numbers, the gesture of a man who would not lie down even when tired. In the rafters, something soft and insistent had made a home; they could hear the low coo and the flutter like folded paper trying to become kite again. \u201cPigeon,\u201d Bassam pronounced, peering upward with the confidence of a naturalist of roofs. \u201cShe thinks this is a tree.\u201d\n\nArif made a noise that was not quite a sigh and not quite a laugh. \u201cWe will charge rent.\u201d He sent the smallest of the apprentices up the ladder with a broom and a box like a man offering a boy a birthday party, and the boy grinned and scrambled, but then hesitated as the pigeon flapped and he wobbled and the ladder rocked and everyone got a little older in an instant.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Nour said, already moving without remembering she had made a decision. The ladder had its own language, the squeak and the slide, and the rafters smelled like dust and the sugar of old heat. The pigeon watched her with that bead eye that felt like the world looking in on itself and made a small sound that wasn\u2019t a quack and wasn\u2019t anything dangerous, just a reminder that small hearts hit their walls very quickly. Nour breathed in the way Mina had told her\u2014under the ribs and then wider than the ribs\u2014and made her body a slow animal. \u201cOkay,\u201d she murmured, as if she were an aunt and the pigeon a toddler messing with the remote. \u201cWe are both intruders, yes? No one will peck anyone\u2019s eyes.\u201d She slid the box close, used the broom to suggest directions with politeness, and in the end lifted the small messy nest with the gentleness of someone carrying a plate of fragile sweets across a crowded room. On the ground, Arif had a plastic crate, and they moved the whole situation to a ledge outside where the pigeon blinked at the sun and reorganized her outrage. Bassam clapped and declared her Queen of Birds for a day, and Nour let him and didn\u2019t mind because her hands had done something they hadn\u2019t done before without shaking, and that was the crown she wanted.\n\nSoraya stole an hour between her work and their class to send Nour a picture of bread that looked like it had fallen asleep on the counter while pretending it was a moon. \u201cI remembered to eat two slices,\u201d she typed, and added three knife emojis in a row as if punctuation could cut the loaf. In class, they fussed over a guidance board that refused to be polite to the environment it had been introduced to, and Soraya swore under her breath in Arabic and French and then apologized to the board as if the components had ears. \u201cWe have two weeks,\u201d she said, tapping the spreadsheet with the offended love you give to a toddler who will not get in the car. \u201cTwo weeks before the people in Al Ain who can give us money and dignity want a demonstration. Not a flight. A tethered tantrum that looks like grace. Habib says yes if the eyebrows say yes.\u201d\n\nFarid\u2019s eyebrows were more persuasive in text than in person; he sent a list that read like a short story about catastrophe and how to avoid becoming its main character. Nour printed it out and taped it to the lab wall and to the inside of her own skull, where she already kept lists: bolts and gaskets and birthdays and the time she should leave if she wanted to arrive without greed. She and Soraya stayed an hour too long that night, soldering in a world that had shrunk to points of light and the occasional squeak of chair legs on linoleum. When they finally turned off the room, it felt like closing the eyes of a sleeping thing.\n\nMina\u2019s studio had learned her shape now, which was not magic but was something; the second visit had fewer introductions, fewer jokes in her head about being an unreligious person in a soft church. Mina kept the fountain on low and the fan on a lower speed and asked fewer questions. \u201cI want you to tell me one thing you like about what happens in your body when you are afraid,\u201d she said, as if that were a normal sentence and the world not full of people who hated their fear entire.\n\nNour startled and then snorted, because the cheeky part of her liked being asked to praise an enemy. \u201cI like that I can feel every door out of a room,\u201d she said, and it was true; fear made architects of cowards. \u201cI like that it sharpens my sight even when I don\u2019t want it to.\u201d\n\nMina nodded as if Nour had offered a new spice to her kitchen. \u201cThen we will feed those parts first,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will not starve fear. We will ask it to sit in a different chair.\u201d\n\nThey did not go to the mangroves. They went only as far as the fountain in the mall with the fake rocks and the real children. Ducks did not go to malls to pretend to be rich; they had better taste. But there were videos of ducks on the phones of three people within five meters, and when a screen lit up in Nour\u2019s peripheral vision with the familiar bobbing foolishness and a caption that read \u201cthis guy is me,\u201d she felt the old flicker and the new practice and put her hand on her own thigh, pressure enough to remind the thigh it was attached to a person. Mina watched her without being an observer; it was a trick of hers. \u201cWhat do you smell,\u201d she asked, and Nour said, \u201cCinnamon, grease, perfume that doesn\u2019t know when to stop.\u201d \u201cWhat do you hear,\u201d Mina asked, and Nour said, \u201cThe fountain, a child complaining about onions, the clicking of a sandal that is about to break.\u201d \u201cWhat do you know,\u201d Mina asked finally, and Nour said, surprising herself with how easily it came, \u201cI know I am in a mall and it is absurd and I am a woman with bolts in her bag and this is not a river.\u201d When they left, the sunset over the highway had decided to perform for the city as if the highway deserved a show, and Mina put her hand briefly on Nour\u2019s shoulder, a soft, precise press, and said, \u201cYou will have to choose a ritual before you see a duck. Choose it now so your body doesn\u2019t make a bad one for you.\u201d\n\nThe tea with the nice engineer was almost good, which is worse in some ways than a disaster because it invites hope to sit down on the sofa and make plans. His name was Kareem and he had a smile that showed he had taught himself to use it kindly, and he asked her questions about her work that were not prying, and when her mother told a joke that made fun of herself, he laughed with her, not at her. He had opinions that were sturdy and not exhausting. He did not flinch when she said \u201cengine\u201d and \u201cgrease.\u201d He did not try to make himself taller by pressing his thumb on someone else\u2019s head. But when he mentioned, smoothly, as if he were placing a teaspoon on a saucer, that one day perhaps she would prefer something \u201ccleaner,\u201d an office with chairs that had opinions about your back and emails that multiplied like polite bacteria, the inside of her went cold the way steel does when you drench it too quickly. She nodded and listened to his story about Germany, about efficient trains and neat trash, and she smiled in the correct places, and her mother watched with the hopeful terror of mothers who would like their daughters to be both rocket and dock.\n\nAfter they left, her mother said nothing for a while and then said everything with her hands, rearranging the fruit in the bowl and turning the television to a cooking show as if recipes could be a conversation about marriage. \u201cHe was nice,\u201d Nour offered, because it was true and because the truth is sometimes a small coin you can hand to someone you love without opening the entire purse. \u201cHe didn\u2019t talk with his elbows.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is nice,\u201d her mother agreed, and then added, because she could not help herself, \u201cHe will want someone who is home on Friday afternoons to make the good rice.\u201d Nour did not say anything. She did not want to open a future on the table and cut it in half while her mother watched. She went to her room and stared at the form she had sent for the certification and felt the quiet hum of her own choosing and it steadied her in the way a good tool steadies a hand when the screw starts to strip.\n\nAt the lab, the tether looked like a leash on a creature that would pretend to hate leashes and secretly be grateful for them. They had bought braided straps rated for more force than this small body would ever think itself capable of, and Farid had checked their anchors and then checked the ground around the anchors as if he could check the desert itself for loyalty. Habib had brought a friend named Maryam who was not frightened by anything human beings made; she had been a firefighter and took the extinguisher from Nour\u2019s hands and showed her two new ways to hold it and three ways to think about its mouth. \u201cIt is a promise you can only keep once,\u201d Maryam said, patting the red cylinder with affection. \u201cMake it a good promise.\u201d When the first tethered burn rattled the strap and strained against its own boundary and then settled and let itself be joy inside limits, Soraya made a noise that was very nearly a sob and then turned it into a cough and then into a laugh, and Nour watched the numbers and the strap and the sand and felt something in her chest remembered from being a child on a swing, the precise moment the chain stopped feeling like gravity and started feeling like air.\n\nIn the second run, a dust devil came like the hand of an impatient god, a twisting column that wrote and erased its name across thirty meters of nothing. It passed behind the stand a heartbeat before the ignition, and Nour saw it in the corner of her eye and did not think so much as lean, the body a lever, two fingers on Soraya\u2019s wrist like a conductor stalling a symphony for a cough. \u201cWait,\u201d she said into the muffling of her muffs, her mouth dry, and Farid\u2019s eyebrows caught the movement on the edge of his own attention and he put his hand flat like a teacher suggesting stillness to a class that wanted to explode. The dust devil walked on, bored, spun out its skirts, and fell apart in dignified chunks. \u201cNow,\u201d Farid said, and nobody called her cautious in a way that meant coward later because everyone had seen the near and the far for what they were. Afterward, in the shade that was never enough shade, Habib handed Nour a piece of dried apricot and said, \u201cGood,\u201d and that was a sentence that could stretch across years and not break.\n\nArif watched her with a look that did not belong to any single emotion when she told him about Al Ain. A part of him admired a thing done well even if it did not bring him invoices paid, and a part of him remembered the boys he had hired who had turned themselves into songs and left and a part of him counted the hours she would not be there to coax bad alternators into being civilized. \u201cYou tell me the days,\u201d he said, as if she were asking him to carry a couch down three flights of stairs with her and he had already started walking. \u201cWe\u2019ll manage. Tell Bassam to stop volunteering your name to every boat with a bird in its background. I will strangle him if he jokes again when it is not funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes it is funny,\u201d she said, because she didn\u2019t want to be unfair to laughter, even when it had bitten her. He rolled his eyes with affection and pretended to refuse to agree.\n\nThe Thursday before Al Ain, Soraya showed up at the workshop door like a wrong part delivered to the right address. She took in the racks of oil and the men glancing at her as if a comet had streaked through their weather and lifted a hand as if to introduce herself to a church. \u201cI\u2019m stealing her,\u201d she told Arif, and Arif did the thing where he pretended he was being mugged and then handed over his wallet with flourish. She sat on an upturned crate while Nour finished with a stubborn belt, her legs long and crossed at the ankle, her face without its practiced lab authority. \u201cI am more afraid than I look,\u201d she admitted, and the admission did not make her smaller, it made her honest. \u201cWhen I was little, I used to hold my mother\u2019s hand crossing the street and I could feel her pulse and I thought it was the city\u2019s pulse and I felt safe because the city was alive. Today I put my hand on my own shoulder and tell it, yes, yes, we are alive and it is enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sound like Mina,\u201d Nour said without mocking, and Soraya laughed and threw her head back in a way that made Bassam drop a wrench because he forgot gravity required him to hold it.\n\nThat evening, when she stopped by Mina\u2019s because anxiety had pecked holes in her schedule and she needed a place to sit where no one asked for anything except air, Mina showed her a silly thing that worked. \u201cChoose a word not for meaning but for feel,\u201d she instructed, tapping her own bottom lip with a finger like a metronome. \u201cChoose a word your mouth likes to make, and put it in your mouth when fear tries to put its own.\u201d Nour tried on several and rejected them because they were too heavy or too clever or too stuck to other stories. She stopped on the word \u201csmooth,\u201d not because her life was smooth but because her tongue understood it and the teeth did not have to argue with it. She said it softly and it made her lips round and then relax, a small muscle apology to an entire system.\n\nThe demonstration at Al Ain was a small circus pretending to be a conference. There were tents and snacks and men with lanyards that made them straighten their backs as if the rectangles around their necks weighed five kilos each. There were women in abayas with shoes that could kill bugs. There were teenagers craning their whole bodies toward the glitter of any thing that sparked. There were men who took pictures of everything including their own feet. The tethered test bed was a modest square in a corner of the field that had been sectioned away from everything else with tape like a crime scene. Farid\u2019s eyebrows were tense with purpose; Habib had a clipboard because sometimes religion needed props; Maryam had a radio and a glare that made teenagers reconsider being entertaining in her vicinity. Soraya wore a cap and a grin that started in something like joy and ended in something like, if you don\u2019t behave I will make you behave.\n\nNour liked the ritual of it, the checking of cords and switches, the way numbers warmed up as if they were sleepy animals. She liked the way her name got called out for tasks that were now hers because they were her size. She liked the way a little girl in a yellow dress watched with her entire skeleton and tugged her father\u2019s sleeve and hissed, \u201cShe,\u201d to make sure he properly recorded the fact of a woman in the center of the tape. When they lit and the engine\u2019s roar diluted itself with the crowd\u2019s noise and the tether thrummed and the stand consented to stay intact and the announcer in a different tent tried to make a joke and failed, Nour stood inside her own hearing and listened. It was not the same as the desert. It was not family. But it was a cousin. It was proof. It was obeyed equations and it was the messy part of joy you cannot graph.\n\nAfter, when the official with a tie shook Soraya\u2019s hand too long and then shook Farid\u2019s briefly and then forgot to shake Nour\u2019s at all, Soraya reached back and took Nour\u2019s wrist and pulled it forward into the handshake like a magician correcting a card trick and made the official look her in the face. His eyes did the thing many men\u2019s eyes do when asked to reckon with the gap between where they thought the axis lay and where it actually does; then he smiled with his teeth and said blunted compliments with adjectives that rolled around as if they were the wrong size. Nour smiled back with her teeth because she had learned to do that and because his opinion was not a wrench she needed.\n\nThey drove back with the smell of dust and popcorn in their hair and ate bread with labneh in the parking lot like teenagers avoiding their own parents. Soraya said she wanted to take the tether off and Nour said she wanted to do it in the desert and Farid said he would rather write five more lists and Habib said quietly, which always carried more weight than shouting, \u201cWe will live longer if we pretend to be patient.\u201d Nour sat on the hood of her car and let the metal warm her through her jeans and thought of the marina, of the boy in the striped shirt who believed in her ministry to ducks and motors, of her mother\u2019s scanning of Kareem\u2019s answers for signs of a man who would take care of a woman who already took care of herself.\n\nOn the Sunday morning after Al Ain, she went to the Corniche on purpose. The sky pressed itself against the water as if trying to see its own pores. Men ran in circles to prove things to themselves and to convince their watches they were not liars. Women negotiated strollers and small negotiations with smaller people. She wore sunglasses and a cap and carried nothing in her hands, a decision that felt bare and right. She sat on a low wall and made her body a slow animal and watched the ducks watch the world. The ritual she had chosen\u2014thumb pressed into the meat of her palm, the silent word smooth moving through her mouth without leaving crumbs\u2014stayed with her like a friend you can take to a party because he will not make you babysit him. The ducks were ducking; one flicked water off its back with a satisfaction no human gets from any shower. One slept standing on a leg, a trick she envied. A child nearby dropped his ice cream, an honest tragedy. Nour felt the breath spike and settle, like a car that revs and remembers it is in a parking lot. She did not stand or leave. She let the fact of them be a piece of the day\u2019s furniture and she was a different piece and nothing about the room needed to be rearranged.\n\nWhen she went home, her mother caught her by the elbow and held her there as if she were checking the tightness of a bolt without tools. \u201cI did not marry off your sister before I was ready,\u201d she said, apropos of nothing and everything. \u201cI am not marrying you off to anyone. Do you hear me.\u201d Nour blinked, startled by the sudden rearranging of furniture in that room. Her mother put her hand on Nour\u2019s cheek as if it were an instrument she could calibrate. \u201cI want you to ask for what you want and be ready to give it up at the same time. This is how we do not break. I do not know how to teach you this and still sleep. So you will teach me. You will tell me when you cannot be in a kitchen on a Friday and I will save you food for Saturday and not make a face. You will bring me your rockets like dates in a box and I will take one and pretend I am not hungry for the whole thing.\u201d\n\nNour laughed then, the laugh that curls into itself, because this was love in her family: bargaining with tenderness, eyes that know but do not say they know. She hugged her mother and felt, for a moment, like a girl again with a skinned knee and an impossible math problem and a father who would kiss the top of her head and tell her a story about carburetors and marriages in the same breath. She had not thought of him in weeks in the way that felt like a sin and also like survival. The memory came with the smell of cigarettes and jasmine and a pair of hands that had built a bookshelf crooked and called it modern.\n\nThat night, a message arrived from Kareem, careful and polite. He asked if she wanted to see a documentary about trains on Thursday and then added, as if laying down a soft rug between them, that if she had rockets on Thursday, he would be glad to go another time. She typed three answers and deleted two and left the third, which was yes, and then the fourth, which was maybe, because she did not yet know if the desert would call her name that night. Her phone chimed again, Soraya asking if she could borrow a specific torque wrench because \u201cFarid does not trust the lab\u2019s and neither do I and Maryam will judge me if the bolt glances at me wrong,\u201d and she chimed back, yes, and then added, \u201cI sat with actual ducks. My word was smooth.\u201d\n\nSoraya replied with a duck emoji and then a sentence that did not pretend to be casual. \u201cI am glad you choose to stay,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn rooms. In yourself. In the work. It makes the work better.\u201d Nour put the phone down and lay on her bed and stared at the ceiling where the blades of the fan had learned to balance a slight wobble with the dignity of an elder. She thought about how much choosing there was in even a small day in a city that pretended to be a machine and was actually a collection of animals pretending not to be animals. She thought about the desert\u2019s patience and Al Ain\u2019s tape and her mother\u2019s bargains and Mina\u2019s words and Laila\u2019s hands and Habib\u2019s yes and Farid\u2019s lists and Soraya\u2019s mouth when she smiled like a woman who might one day look at a thing she made and be held by it instead of the other way round.\n\nIn the week that followed, life did the thing it does when you are looking in another direction: it added small emergencies like spices to a dish you were already trying to keep from boiling over. An old client arrived with a radiator that had decided to quit in the middle of the Abu Dhabi\u2013Dubai road and had to be coddled into remembering the concept of water. A delivery was late. A cousin sent a voice note crying because her boss had yelled at her in front of everyone and Nour sent back the only kind of voice note there is for that, which is one where you say words like \u201cyou are not a child\u201d and \u201cyour work is not your worth\u201d and also \u201cbring me his brake pads and I will make them squeal for a month.\u201d At night, she tuned the tiny escapements of watch videos and let their clicks be proof that order was not a superstition. In the morning, she bought extra bread and didn\u2019t tell Soraya she was going to forget to eat it, she simply left it wrapped on the lab table and drew a face on the paper bag with two dots and a line so it could pretend to be a person and keep Soraya company when she wasn\u2019t there.\n\nOn Thursday, she stood in the lab doorway with the torque wrench in her hand and a text from Kareem on her phone and the sound of the world negotiating with itself in the hallway and realized she could hold two things in a hand when she\u2019d been taught it was only a handle. She placed the wrench on the table and told Soraya to bring it back with her life intact. She told Kareem she would arrive to the film late and leave early. She told herself she would go to the Corniche on Friday after prayer and sit with the people who fed birds against the advice of signs and she would not feed them because the signs were right and she wanted to learn a different kind of mercy. She walked into her day with her hands ready, and inside her the word smooth warmed and cooled like breath.",

                              "content": "The week after Al Ain began with the kind of heat that seemed less like temperature and more like a decision. It sank early into the day and did not do the courtesy of lifting at sunset, as if the city had signed a contract with summer and was bound to honor it even when everyone whispered about breaking the terms. At the workshop, fans clicked and hummed without changing anything important. Bassam wore a damp towel under his cap and drank water like he\u2019d been paid to set an example. Arif stood at the parts counter and squinted at a spreadsheet as if it had personally offended him. The pigeons who had tried to lease the rafters held their meetings outside now and made loud opinions at intervals as if to say, this arrangement is substandard. Nour moved through the day with a slightly different weight in her arms, a residue of Al Ain\u2019s tether and the particular way it vibrated in her bones when joy was constrained and behaved. The certification sessions with Laila had knocked a burr off her mind; her grip had changed by a degree that meant faster work without hurrying. When Laila paused by her bench during a practice assessment and murmured, \u201cYou are not doing more, you are doing less cleanly,\u201d Nour felt the small click inside that meant a part had found its seat. She went home in the evenings and every so often touching the inside of her palm, that pressure point Mina had taught her, as if it were a tiny light switch she could flick without anyone seeing.\n\nThe rocket\u2019s next steps appeared on Soraya\u2019s whiteboard as if they had walked in on their own. They were numbers and arrows and a list that started tame and became ambitious halfway down, like someone writing a note to a friend and remembering midway the thing they wanted to ask for that felt impossible. They needed a better regulator for the oxidizer line and a set of quick-release clamps that had to be a certain grade because anything lower would become shrapnel at precisely the wrong moment. The clamps were not in the country and the regulator was, allegedly, inside a warehouse in Mussafah whose address had been recorded in a language that did not desire to be read. Soraya made phone calls and spoke in the voice she used for bureaucrats, which was friendly to your face and disassembling your arguments at the same time. Habib said he had a cousin who knew a man who could bend metal to order if you brought coffee that tasted like the old days. Farid, with his eyebrows like punctuation marks you only used when you were serious, sent them a PDF of alternatives that would not insult the laws of physics. In all of it, Nour found herself becoming the person you let hold a piece while you argued what the piece should be. She went with Habib to a shop tucked behind two others where an old man with hands that had been apprenticed to files before machines were trusted considered their sketch and said, \u201cThis wants to be steel, not aluminum. Aluminum gets dreamy in heat. Steel knows who it is.\u201d He said it without romance, like a man looking at an old friend who had become more himself with age. They watched him cut and polish, the motion slow enough that you could have taken a nap in it and woken to find a perfect circle of work done. Nour liked the smell of ground steel and the patience that lived in that room; it felt like entering a small mosque and being allowed to sit without knowing the words.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Soraya texted her as if admissible panic came with a specific ringtone. The message was a photograph of her own face in the reflective glass of a university office and the caption, \u201cI have to perform competence to a man who thinks rockets are an expensive way to tell men they matter.\u201d Nour put down the alternator she was pretending to be interested in and asked Arif without asking to leave for an hour. The admin building had its own microclimate of air-conditioning and ambition. Upstairs, a dean with neat hair smiled like a tourist who had been promised a rare animal and was now being shown a cat. He liked the optics of innovation, he said; he liked the word pipeline; he liked beginnings he could stand near during photo sessions. Soraya stood very straight and did not flinch when he suggested they invite a sponsor who wanted to put their name on something vertical. \u201cWe need the regulator and the quick-release clamps, and we need them to be the right ones,\u201d she said, and Nour loved her a little for refusing to translate their needs into entertainment. \u201cIf we decorate failure with logos, we will still be failures and more people will be watching.\u201d The dean\u2019s smile held, but his eyes moved to the window where a palm was having its fronds combed by the wind. Nour did not speak. She set the regulator drawing on the table as if it were a photo of the dean\u2019s grandchild and allowed the neatness of the lines to do a part of the persuading. It did, which was a small miracle. He sighed in the particular way of men who wanted to give in with dignity and said to send him the list again, this time with fewer adjectives. When they left, Soraya exhaled like a kettle taken off the stove and bumped her shoulder lightly against Nour\u2019s as if to thank her body for being in the room without performing.\n\nKareem was good at choosing things that promised clarity. The documentary about trains was crisp in its angles and narrated by a voice that sounded like an expensive lecture. They sat side by side in the dark and he made exactly two jokes under his breath, both quiet and both decent, and offered her the popcorn without comment when her fingers hesitated because she had washed them three times and still thought she could smell the faint iron of a wrench. He asked, afterward, if she ever wanted to design and not fix, and he did not say what many people thought, which was that fixing was smaller than designing, but the implication hung like a missing screw you didn\u2019t know where to put back. \u201cFixing is designing backwards,\u201d she said, and his smile was surprised and admiring. He did not argue with her about Fridays. He did not correct her mother on the name of a spice. He drove smoothly and did not perform bravery when a taxi drifted into their lane like a fish. She liked him, which made the no that lived somewhere relaxed inside her chest harder to negotiate with. When her phone bent the night open with Soraya\u2019s message asking if she had left the torque wrench at the lab, she excused herself with the truth and Kareem didn\u2019t do the petty flinch that had broken other men for her. \u201cBring it back with a story I understand,\u201d he said, and when he dropped her at the lab door he did not try to lean in through a moment like a man reaching for a bowl he had not been offered.\n\nMaryam insisted they do the extinguisher drill again even though Farid\u2019s eyebrows insisted they had done enough for a night. She set up a tray of sand and a controlled flame that made the kind of noise that made a room want to be taken seriously. \u201cHere,\u201d she showed Nour, \u201cdo not choke the fire from the top because that is what your fear wants you to do. Slide your breath over it. Persuade the base. Be a diplomat.\u201d Maryam handled danger with a familiarity that would have frightened Nour in any other person. In Maryam it was integrity. After the third run, when the flame died the way a stubborn person sometimes concedes without saying they were wrong, Farid put the pin back in the extinguisher and said, into the room, which was not his habit, \u201cI lost a friend because he salted confidence into a gap that needed humility. I am not eyebrows because I like to stop fun. I am eyebrows because I want to keep your names off a stone.\u201d The sentence changed something quiet in the space. Soraya drew a tick on her list and said nothing witty, which was the correct kind of honor.\n\nMina had the unnerving idea that perhaps they should go to the mangroves before Nour felt ready to decide she would never need to go to the mangroves again. She suggested dawn, because dawn is when the world has not yet built its objections for the day. They rented narrow kayaks that felt like polite pencils over water and pushed off in a corridor of green that did not care who they were. The air tasted like leaf and salt and the old damp secret of mud. Heron stood knee-deep in mirrors and looked like monks. Crabs flailed sideways, offended at this intrusion. The water ducks, the ones who wore their black-and-white with the smug tidiness of uniforms, moved away without hurry and turned their heads to be sure the story was interesting. Nour\u2019s heart did the courtesy of banging for a minute and then slowed because there was nowhere to run and because the word she had brought into her mouth had the texture her body wanted. Smooth, she told her tongue, smooth, as if she were filing an edge off a burr that wanted to catch and tear. Mina\u2019s paddle made small ripples and her breath made a quiet like a secret being kept for the correct reasons. They did not perform therapy. Nobody asked if Nour felt better yet. They drifted. At a bend, a flock of flamingos stood absurd and precise, their legs written in the wrong font, their beaks doing the ta-da motion that seems a joke until you think of mud and the labor that is sifting for food. Nour felt relief that they were not ducks and then irritation with herself for ranking birds by how much they frightened her. She breathed, and the breathing did not cure her. It met her where she was and walked a little way with her.\n\nThere are always the days when other people\u2019s urgencies stick to your clothes. Her mother\u2019s friend Fatima fainted at the women\u2019s center and Nour left in the middle of a torque lecture to drive her and her anxious niece to the clinic, where they sat on orange plastic chairs that had a texture like a lizard and waited while a nurse with eyes like a kind river organized the chaos into something that felt like mercy. Fatima came out with a prescription for the kind of rest women are not offered unless they faint in public, and while Nour scrabbled in her bag for the car keys, her mother, who had arrived with water and dates and the force of a small militia, waved her away and then, as if she had planned to say it at a table rather than under a fluorescent light, said, \u201cYour father would have made the ducks into a joke and then bitten his lip when you laughed and later he would have said to me in the kitchen, we must help her or we will regret the day we raised someone with eyes too open. He had fear. It wore other clothes. He didn\u2019t call it by its name so it sometimes pretended to be something else and he had to chase it around the apartment with a broom and then laugh because the neighbors were listening. I want you to call yours by its name and ask it to stay in one room.\u201d It was the closest she had ever come to telling Nour that the man she missed had been less tidy inside than his stories had led his daughters to believe. Nour touched the soft inside of her mother\u2019s forearm like a person who has been handed a plate full of history and does not want to drop it.\n\nThe first untethered test was put on the board not with a marker but with the carefulness of people who knew that lines could be erased by circumstances and not by will. It was three Thursdays out. It would be small, a hop like a promise rather than a journey, a hand on a ledge to remind the body that it can lift itself. The date clanged against the date her mother had for a cousin\u2019s dinner where Kareem\u2019s mother would attend and deploy the kind of politeness that made people lie about their preferences. Soraya said, \u201cWe should not do it if the wind has opinions,\u201d and Farid said, \u201cWe should not do it if the temperature rises like a man bragging,\u201d and Habib said nothing, which meant he was inventing all the ways it could go wrong and choosing which ones to prevent with his hands. Nour told her mother she couldn\u2019t come to the dinner and her mother, who had decided to be a better ally to her daughter than to other mothers\u2019 plans, made a show of reluctance and then sent a voice note to the cousin full of pious excuses. Kareem wrote, \u201cI will visit my grandparents instead and not offend your rocket,\u201d and sent a small train emoji as if to make sure humor stayed in the room. She wrote back, \u201cWe have a leash but it is hidden; we are pretending it is freedom,\u201d and then put the phone down because the combine harvester in her head that shredded other people\u2019s expectations could be very efficient when it got going.\n\nThey came to the desert again, smaller in number because for once Farid\u2019s eyebrows had scared away spectators who were not serious. The sky was a blank coin; it did not plan to show them anything, which was a mercy. The rocket stood in the stand like a child in a school uniform, tidy and hopeful and perhaps ready to cry. Nour moved through the checks with a slowness that felt like competence and not dread, because Mina had told her her body could not tell the difference if she performed ease long enough to forget acting. A bird trailed its shadow across the sand behind the stand during the first ignition cycle and her throat made a muscle that wanted to become her whole. She put a hand down flat on the console and felt the plastic\u2019s unromantic warmth and named the bird in her head something else, a flash, a moving piece of shade, a nothing that her muscles could arrange themselves around without preparing to die. \u201cHold,\u201d she said into the calm of everyone\u2019s expectation, and Maryam, who once had learned to admire people who hesitated for good reasons, nodded and adjusted the clock. The bird tilted away because birds obeyed a physics of their own and cared nothing for engineering. Farid gestured a small circle that meant, fine, we can have another breath, and Habib put his hand on the line that led to flame and said in a low tone, because you always asked A God before you asked your god, \u201cNow.\u201d It rose the way a breath rises before a word. It rose and it was small and it was nothing you would put on a poster, and still, in the way the sand moved and the strap did not move because there was no strap and the stand held and the numbers were within their lines, it was the kind of victory you had to be standing close to in order to see. Soraya shouted and then remembered not to and clapped her hands over her mouth and clapped anyway because why not. Farid did a thing with his eyebrows she would later call a dance if anyone asked.\n\nThey were still laughing like idiots when Nour\u2019s phone found service and drank all the messages it had missed. Her mother had sent a picture of a coffee tray and a thumbs-up. Kareem had sent a photograph of his grandmother\u2019s hands on a prayer bead and a sentence, \u201cI hope your fire behaved; mine did.\u201d Mina had sent nothing, which was also a message, a space left for Nour to fill with her own experience rather than narrate it on command. Habib handed out dates and said, now we will talk about the one degree it leaned and the half degree of thermal expansion we did not seduce into compliance. Soraya wanted to dance and Maryam wanted everyone to drink more water and Farid wanted the list to be updated before the high of success made everyone lie to themselves about what had gone wrong that had not gone wrong far enough to injure.\n\nOn the edge of that day and the next, the story at the workshop, the one that used to be \u201cduck girl,\u201d became subject to vandalism. Someone\u2014probably the delivery man from three doors down who thought his wit had been underappreciated by history\u2014stuck a sticky note on her box of sockets that read \u201cQuack Queen.\u201d Bassam saw it before she did and removed it with a violence that was almost affectionate, then threw the note under the workbench and crushed it with an unconvincing attempt to look casual. Arif appeared, took the long way around to the trash, and then stood in front of the men as if he were about to give a speech he had not written. \u201cHer name is Nour,\u201d he said to the room with the tone of a man who had decided to put his hand on a machine to see if it was dangerous and had found that it was less dangerous than letting it make noise. \u201cYou call her Nour or you say hey mechanic like you say hey to me and you put your little jokes where the sun can dry them out until they shrink.\u201d Someone muttered a complaint about how nobody could have fun anymore and Arif looked at him with a face that said fun had been repossessed pending payments. The room changed, a tiny click only people like Nour would hear. She felt the lack of a weight as much as she would have felt the weight itself.\n\nSoraya lived in an apartment that had a view of a piece of a park and a busy road and a sliver of the kind of sky that seemed like an architectural detail rather than atmosphere. She invited Nour over on a Sunday with the promise of fresh bread and coffee and a consultation about a diagram that had started to lose its shyness. Nour arrived with jam and a container of olives from a store where the olives liked to sit in fat, and stood in the doorway while Soraya apologized for the way her table was dedicated to indecisions about fins. The bread, glossy and brown like a pomegranate seed writ large, made the room smell like men in novels who come home to women in aprons except there was no man and no apron and the women did their own dishes. They ate with their fingers and wiped the plates with the bread in a way that would have made someone\u2019s aunt wince, and talked about Damascus with a tenderness that had little to do with geography and everything to do with a childhood full of ordinary violence and oranges. Soraya had a plant that didn\u2019t understand why it was alive and Nour had empathy. She watered it with the stinginess of someone who wants a relationship to mean something. The talk, without any announcement, drifted toward the place it sometimes tilted now, the ledge where it looked down into a pool that could be called love if you began to point at it too soon and could be called friendship if you wanted to keep your bones inside their famous boxes. Soraya laughed and touched Nour\u2019s wrist with exactly the amount of pressure you use when you want to confirm that a thing exists but would prefer not to risk cracking it, and Nour looked away at a fly on the window that seemed to be practicing a speech and said that Habib believed aluminum became dreamy when it was hot and she feared she became dreamy when she was not careful. Soraya put her chin in her hand and said, \u201cWe will use steel when we have to and forgive aluminum when we can,\u201d and there was a moment like the pause before a song decides to not play the note you expected.\n\nThe storm that week came with less theater than the shamal and did more quiet damage. It arrived with a dense ceiling that moved like a patient with a drip, and by noon the city had turned into a wet machine. The workshop roof decided it was decorative and allowed water where water was not invited. They moved boxes like people saving books in a house getting a new roof, grumbling and sliding tarps around like chess pieces. When the door stuck because the wood learned to swell, they propped it open because nobody wanted to be trapped in a room that smelled like oil and wet cardboard and humility. Late in the afternoon, in that tired hour when even jokes limp, something small and wet with a purpose waddled in under the propped door and gave the floor a look like a man making an appraisal of real estate. It was a duck, or a cousin of a duck, or the ghost of the first duck that had rearranged Nour\u2019s sense of what rooms were for. Bassam yelped in a way that he would deny later and Arif lifted his hands and then lowered them because he remembered the last time his flapping had taught the bird everything it needed to know about chaos. Nour was at the back, wiping a spill and wondering if the rag ever learned it was laboring under a metaphor, and she straightened and turned and caught it full in the body, that combination of panic and history and the muscle memory of an animal you had never held having already held you. Her vision did the brief ring-around of a tunnel and then loosened. She pressed her thumb into her palm, found the small bone Mina had showed her, and said nothing because speaking felt like declaring war or surrendering and neither was asked for. The duck advanced with the constitutional of a minister inspecting a new building. It peered under the Saab these days sleeping in one corner like a lazy prince. It did not fly, because it did not want to, because perhaps it knew something about rooms and ceilings that she herself had learned the hard way.\n\nBassam whispered, as if the duck were an examiner, \u201cShould we offer it coffee,\u201d and Arif whispered back, \u201cOffer it the door.\u201d Nour took one step to the side, not toward it and not away. In that space, which was narrow and held too many tools, she could sense each exit as if her fear had dropped coins in every slot. She did not look at the duck\u2019s eye because that was a needle into which her panic had threaded its loudest thread, but she did not look away in flinching either. She looked at the floor a foot ahead of its feet and let her breath arrange itself around the word. Smooth went through her like a small boat on water, not loud, not a question subject to debate. The duck reached the door\u2019s spill of light and paused as if to check its credentials. It turned its head, as if inconvenienced by the weather, and then it went out the way good stories leave, with a last small punctuation rather than a moral. The room did not erupt into applause because the room was not a movie. Bassam exhaled like a balloon losing a secret. Arif chuckled in the low register of men congratulating themselves on not having made things worse. Nour leaned her hip against the workbench and found that her knees were not jelly, exactly. They were made of a substance that does not belong in textbooks but that engineers would learn to name if they watched women in storms.\n\nLater, she told Mina and Mina did not call it a triumph. She called it a good visit. Later, she told Soraya and Soraya sent back a duck emoji and then the words, \u201cI will write your name on the inside of my skull tonight so I can remember how to be brave when a dean asks me to be charming.\u201d Later, she told her mother and her mother threw her hands in the air and thanked God as if God handled ducks personally, then pretended she had never doubted her daughter could walk through any room in any world and find the spoons in the right drawer.\n\nThe day they queued for a part at a warehouse in an industrial zone whose streets had discovered how to be both grid and maze, Nour stood behind a man whose shirt announced he fixed lifts for a living and in front of a teenager whose shirt announced a band he had never heard live. The air smelled like boxes and resignation. Soraya had gone to sign something in a glass office where the man wore a watch too large for his wrist and Farid had sent them both a checklist to fill out while they waited because he believed boredom was where risk bred. The teen behind her watched a video on his phone of a seaplane touching down and skimming a blue that wished it had been a lake in a place where summer came with a different curriculum. He glanced up at her and said, in the conversational tone of someone who thinks he has discovered a neutral topic, \u201cI\u2019m going to learn to fly,\u201d and she said, \u201cI\u2019m going to learn to land,\u201d and he laughed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s always the same thing,\u201d and she said, \u201cNo,\u201d and he said nothing else because he was a person who had just been told there were two kinds of same.\n\nBy the time the clamps arrived and the regulator had been coaxed into the shape opera would be proud of and the desert had made a habit of accepting their footprints, Nour had started to think of ducks as something she would one day have to explain to someone younger until they grew up and acquired their own ridiculous thing. Kareem sat with her on a bench after the train film and asked her if she might like to see a real train yard in Mina Zayed where rust rehearsed the end of steel and she said yes to the yard and no to the implication that she was ready to fit her hours into a container that had to be inventoried by someone else. He told her about a project that would send him to Sharjah for two months and she felt a small release like a knot loosening in a rope because distance is not always a threat; sometimes it is a place to think without being watched.\n\nOn an evening that did not think it was different from any other, Laila called and asked if she would come speak to a girl in her class who had decided that being the only woman in a room meant she had arrived at the wrong room. Nour went and found a girl who looked like every girl and like no girl she had ever met, a girl who was trying to make her hands listen to a torque wrench and make her ears ignore laughter from a cluster of young men who had not yet learned to train their joy into something useful. She told the girl what Laila had told her and what her mother would have told her and what Mina would whisper in a room with water and what Soraya said with her eyes when she watched a gauge steady, and when the girl laughed at exactly one joke in the right way and refused four others, when she placed the wrench on the bolt and felt a thing line up that had not lined up inside her before, Nour sat down on the stool and looked away because sometimes the dignity you can offer someone is pretending you\u2019ve seen this small miracle a thousand times and it still makes you happy but you won\u2019t make a song and dance because you know it will scare it off.\n\nThere was talk of flying to Liwa because the sand there was a different language and the sky was a bigger permission. Habib had cousins there too because men like Habib have cousins everywhere a tool is admired. Farid said if they went he would make a tent out of caution and make them sleep under it. Soraya wanted to fly at dawn because dawn had been kind to her once and you never forget who was kind to you when you were small. Nour wanted to be under a machine that obeyed her even if for a handful of seconds. It was the kind of plan that put a new layer on your days, a glaze that made everything reflect more light. In bed one night, before sleep, she thought of the moment the duck had crossed the workshop and been only a duck, and the way the rocket had risen and been only a machine, and the way a boy in a striped shirt had listened to a ratchet like it was a lullaby, and the way her mother had looked at her and said a thing no one had taught her to say because mothers sometimes have to invent sentences on the spot. She thought of all the hands, how they were a culture of their own, and how they trained the heart to be less dramatic.\n\nIn the morning, she received a message from a number she did not know with a photograph of a note pinned to the corkboard by the elevator that read in neat handwriting, \u201cIf your fear is called by a name, introduce it to your other names.\u201d There was no signature. She smiled at the corkboard like a conspirator and walked into the day with a sense that the city had decided to become a little bit of a village, and that somewhere in the rafters some small creature was making a nest that would not be evicted because it chose the right ledge and the right time.",

Abu Dhabi had not yet decided what face to put on; its glass towers held their reflections to their chests like secret photographs, and the arterial roads ran without pulse. Nour carried sleep like a heavy sweater over one arm and a box of clamps as if the clamps might learn to escape if she let them feel too free. Soraya\u2019s voice on the phone\u2014bring the spare igniters, I left them in the fridge next to the labneh, don\u2019t ask\u2014made her smile into the dark of the stairwell. Her mother had set dates and walnuts by the door with the obvious pretense that she had simply forgotten them there and not stayed up long past her own patience to see her daughter off. \u201cSend me one picture of sand and one of your eyebrows when you are not pretending not to be afraid,\u201d she had said in a whisper that pretended to be practical. Nour kissed the side of her face and promised what she could.\n\nBy the time they were on the highway that sloped out of the city like a stitched seam, the dawn had started lacing light between the low clouds. Trucks carried their mysteries into the interior. The radio played Qur\u2019an at a volume that made even the air-conditioner behave more respectfully. Soraya hummed under her breath between sips of coffee that had not cooled enough to be drinkable but had been declared drinkable by will. Habib was already ahead by an hour, his cousin having called to say the dunes had shifted the way lazy kings rearrange furniture. Farid sent a message that included wind speed, humidity, and a photograph of his shoes on the sand with a caption that read, \u201cStable enough to displease me less than usual.\u201d Maryam, in her way, sent no message, which was better than a promise because it indicated she had already counted the extinguishers and insulted the one whose gauge looked like it was lying.\n\nLiwa rolled up out of the dark like a beast humping its back. The dunes were not polite mounds; they were long, sinuous spines, their crests combed by a hand that wanted drama. The sand here was a different grammar. It slid and sang and made the wind a speechmaker. Habib waited with the kind of patience that can only be earned by saying no to something that wanted to be yes a thousand times. He stood by the Land Cruiser with a thermos and a smile that didn\u2019t move the corners of his mouth and said, \u201cThe ridge there will keep the morning steady until nine. After that, it will be like arguing with a teenager. Put your machines on this side so they do not think they are the ones who own the sky.\u201d\n\nThey built the day like a small temple. The stand, lower and braced wide because sand doesn\u2019t bargain with narrow bases, took its place facing a line where the ground leaned without committing to an angle. Farid measured things nobody else would have thought to measure; he tapped the guy lines with his boot and listened like a man reading a poem for tone. Soraya\u2019s hair, braided furiously, swung behind her like a punctuation mark you could use to end an argument. Nour laid out the clamps and bolts on a piece of tarp where the edges had been weighted with shoes and one stubborn rock. The power pack made its little industrial whine and for a moment it sounded like a mosquito deciding whether to insult them; then it settled into usefulness. The sun climbed as if it had been dared. Their shadows pulled themselves thin and lay down.\n\nNour\u2019s chest made its old preparations, but the rest of her had learned other habits. She pressed her thumb into the soft place in her palm when the wind made a sudden suggestion across her neck. She let the word smooth melt across her tongue without bothering her with meaning. She counted the exits even in a place with no walls to give exits their character. She made another inventory, the one she liked better: Habib\u2019s oversight, Soraya\u2019s eyes like flashlights, Farid\u2019s eyebrows like a fence you were glad was there, Maryam\u2019s extinguishers like small blunt promises. When Soraya leaned close to ask if the data cable sat properly and her breath warmed Nour\u2019s cheek through the morning chill, Nour\u2019s mind flickered to Kareem\u2019s message\u2014a picture of the Sharjah commuter line at dawn with only one passenger visible, a caption reading \u201cFor your train heart\u201d\u2014and back again without getting lost. It was like holding two tools and knowing which one to use without insulting the other.\n\n\u201cLast checks,\u201d Farid said, and even the wind quieted the way men quiet at the beginning of prayer. Habib ran a hand along the frame as if smoothing back hair from a child\u2019s forehead. Nour crouched to the regulator and felt the metal, warmer now, under her fingers with that intimate recognition mechanics carry like religion. The new quick-release clamps sat with a smug handsomeness that made her want to slap them and also kiss them. Soraya mounted the little payload, a packet that would betray altitude and attitude with precision and self-respect, and murmured something under her breath that sounded suspiciously like a negotiation with fate.\n\nThe first ignition was a breath. It lifted a hand\u2019s breadth, more a shrug than a jump, and settled obedient as if to say, I have seen the idea, I am willing to consider it. The sand puffed and fell. The second went higher, the lean corrected by a whisper of thrust vectoring that Soraya would credit to math and Nour would credit to kindness and Habib would credit to their grandmothers. They whooped weakly, cautious about waking any gods lazing under the dunes. On the third, the machine forgot itself for a second, as machines do. The nozzle coughed, a pop like arrogance becomes humility, and the body tilted in the wrong direction as if trying on a slant somebody else had recommended. Nour, who had been watching in two directions as always\u2014numbers and sand, Soraya\u2019s face and Habib\u2019s posture\u2014felt the wrongness before she could name it. She took a step without thinking and then took it back because moving toward was not the wisdom here. Maryam was already upright, extinguisher in her hands like an old friend being reintroduced at a party. Farid\u2019s eyebrows performed the equivalence of a shouted stop. Soraya\u2019s fingers went to the cut switch before Nour had completed the thought that they should. The engine shut down with the offended beep of a machine told it could not have the toy it wanted. They all breathed.\n\n\u201cHeat soak,\u201d Habib said after a quiet that would have embarrassed a showman. \u201cWe are greedy. We make it humble with time.\u201d He squinted at the fin that had caught a kiss from grit and tilted his head so the glare slid off his eyes. \u201cShe would have landed. She wanted to show off and then she remembered who was watching.\u201d\n\nIt was the kind of benign scare that strengthens bonds instead of loosening screws. They turned the stand into a lecture for themselves: this snugness here, that shameful almost-pulse there. Soraya scribbled a note on the back of her hand, then shook it, laughter bubbling up through the layers of adrenaline. \u201cFarid, your eyebrows nearly launched independently,\u201d she said, and he sniffed in a way that admitted how close a thing had been to the kind of moment he had given his life over to preventing. Nour flexed her fingers, surprised by the gentler tremor that traveled through her bones; it was not panic, it was aftershock, and she could forgive it. She looked at the sky, its bland generosity, at the dune with its long lip like a smirk, and thought of how often she had mistaken the universe\u2019s indifference for mercy and then, sometimes, it surprised her by being merciful anyway.\n\nThey ate the dates her mother had insisted look accidental on the counter. Sand stuck to the side of the thermos and made the coffee taste like someone\u2019s backyard in summer. Habib\u2019s cousin arrived for a visit and did the desert thing where you sit down and let your words fall out like seeds; he told a story about a camel that refused to cross a shadow, repeated with relish the phrase \u201cstupid champion,\u201d and in the middle of his second cup asked Soraya without malice if her father knew where she was. \u201cHe knows where he lost me,\u201d she said, and the cousin laughed with his head thrown back and clapped his hands as if she had done a magic trick.\n\nBy nine, the wind made itself into a person in the room who wouldn\u2019t wait their turn to speak. They packed, slower than they needed to because leaving any piece behind would be a curse nobody wanted to put their name on. The stand went into the back with the patient exhale of metal fitting around metal. Soraya wiped a smear of oil from Nour\u2019s cheek with her thumb and then seemed startled by her own interference, her hand hovering as if editing its gesture. Nour tilted her face into the pressure with a brief shamelessness and then reached for the tarp, which was less dangerous than what she wanted.\n\nDriving back, the radio decided to play songs that have learned to be better than they are because they remind you of a time you were okay. Soraya, who had been vibrating on a string of what-if since the cough, began to talk in little bursts about ignorance and luck and the plan to take everything apart that night. \u201cWe will soften our greed with math,\u201d she said, and looked at Nour when she wanted to borrow steadiness. Nour told her about Laila\u2019s sentence\u2014do less cleanly\u2014and watched the way that phrase tucked itself into Soraya\u2019s chest like a folded cloth. She texted her mother one picture of a dune and one of her own eyebrows angled deliberately into a pretend worry; her mother sent back a laugh broken into pieces by voice note and a photograph of a frying pan that might once have dreamed of flying too. Kareem\u2019s message chimed like a polite knock on a door\u2014my grandfather fell asleep on his prayer beads during duhr, the train yard smelled like bread\u2014 and she wrote back, preserving the thread but not knitting anything with it that would be hard to undo. The road unspooled into city, warehouse fronts blinking awake into their desultory industry.\n\nThe workshop had taken the storm personally and then forgiven it. The smell inside was that specific combination of hot rubber and damp cloth that made Nour think of childhood in the summer when her father kept the balcony door cracked during rain just to smell it, just to let the house remember the world was not always an apartment. Arif had lost a shelf to stubborn gravity and was performing a funeral that involved muttered curses and a broom. Bassam wore the expression of a man who had been made to move something heavy for someone who had called him brother. The pigeons had reconstituted themselves on the ledge, like a myth you cannot fix by throwing water at it. \u201cYou come back with all your parts,\u201d Arif observed, glancing at Nour\u2019s wrists as if he had learned to count her fingers by instinct. \u201cGod is generous when people are careful.\u201d He did not ask for stories because he would get them from her face and from Soraya\u2019s hands later when she arrived with a regulator to apply to his arguments about the price of valves.\n\nThey rolled into the routine so quickly it felt like a trick. A sedan with an electrical problem asked her to listen with the part of her that had been trained by ghosts. A man with a busted alternator wanted to tell her about his grandchild and she wanted to ask him what he thought of men who took pictures of ducks but she kept her questions to the sort that had solutions you could hold. The boy in the striped shirt from the marina came in with his father to pick up a part and stumped importantly around the shop with a piece of scrap pipe like a baton. He saluted her with it and she saluted back with her ratchet and his father put a hand over his mouth to hide a grin and failed. \u201cHe made a speech to the ducks last week,\u201d the man said, eyes shining with pride that had found a place to sit. \u201cThey listened badly but he believes himself and that is victory.\u201d\n\nIn the evening, she went with her mother to the cousin\u2019s dinner she had skipped last week for the desert, because life insisted on its balance sheet. The apartment smelled like cumin and talc and women\u2019s perfume that wanted to flirt with strangers. Kareem\u2019s mother had the face of someone who had survived several eras of decorum and had adjusted her grace accordingly; she pressed Nour\u2019s hand and asked about engines in a way that made the questions into offerings instead of tests. Kareem himself looked tired in a way that made his kindness even more visible, the way certain metals show their polish better in dim light. He stood with Nour by the window during a brief lull when a child had knocked over a glass and everyone had to become firefighters, and he told her a story about his grandmother teaching him to balance a tray of tea glasses on one hand, the patience required, the muscle in the forearm you never think about until it hurts. She wanted to tell him that holding a rocket engine with restraint was the same lesson at another volume, but she thought maybe he knew that already and that their analogies did not need to be identical to be a kind of intimacy. His hand brushed her knuckles when he took the emptied plate from her, a touch so practiced it could have been accidental, and she let it be accidental because sometimes that is kinder to everyone involved.\n\nAfter, on the drive home, her mother made small approving noises about how Kareem\u2019s mother folded her napkin, about the way Kareem did not ask if Nour intended to stop working when she married because he had learned not to mistake politeness for ambition. Nour made noises in reply that could be read as agreement and could be read as evasive; she did not want to pin the future to the upholstery of the car. \u201cI did not ask you to choose tonight,\u201d her mother said finally, which is what mothers say when their bones ache with the effort of not asking. \u201cI am trying not to ask you to choose any night. I am learning from your rockets about tethering. You see? I am modern.\u201d The laugh that followed caught on a stitch in her breath. Nour reached across and squeezed the bony place under her mother\u2019s elbow that had always been the secret lever making her soften, and her mother sniffed as if the city had put too much pepper in its dust and then changed the radio to a song about tea and lovers.\n\nThe week folded itself into days that pretended to be ordinary and were not. Soraya developed a way of looking at the whiteboard that meant nobody should interrupt her surrender to an idea unless the building was burning. Farid found a small conspiracy of risk in a bracket everyone had ignored and dismantled it with the satisfaction of a man who believes he can reduce the number of times the world surprises him badly. Maryam took Nour aside and taught her how to read the way a flame leans in a breeze indoors, because not all danger announces itself with noise. Laila stopped by the workshop unannounced and watched Nour for ten minutes the way a person watches a pot to catch it in the act of boiling, then nodded once and left a small package on the counter containing a pair of gloves with better tactility that felt like being handed a compliment wrapped in rubber. Mina sent a voice note that was only the sound of the sea near the corniche and it left Nour with the feeling of salt drying on skin and a whisper about how bodies keep score in their own sloppy ledgers.\n\nOn a Tuesday afternoon with heat that pushed at the windows and tried to be a personality trait, the call came that the university wanted to put them in the glossy magazine that alumni used to prove the money had not been wasted on future. Soraya groaned and then made her hair behave until it matched someone\u2019s notion of competence, which amused Nour so much she said a sentence she had not planned. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be beautiful for money,\u201d she said, and Soraya\u2019s mouth tilted into a smile that involved shame and agreement and something like warmth that had no business in a fluorescent hallway. They posed with their machines and tried to look as if they did not know where the camera was, and afterward Soraya stole Nour into a stairwell that had been painted five times and smelled like institutional lemon. \u201cIf this were a story someone made up,\u201d she said, propping her foot on a step and lacing and unlacing, \u201cwe would be halfway to a catastrophe that would teach us what we love. I would prefer to skip the catastrophe.\u201d Nour laughed and said she would too, and they stood there with that option on the landing between them like baggage neither wanted to claim.\n\nThat night, in a small reprieve between obligations heavy as engines, Nour went to the Corniche without needing to prove anything to herself. The water wore the light that came off the hotels like borrowed jewelry and the air had decided to be breathable. Ducks made their sketch of the day in the shallow ripples; their necks were lines the city could not draw with steel. A child ran by holding a plastic bag like a kite and his father pretended to chase him with a roar that turned halfway into laughter. Nour sat on a low wall and put her palms against the stone and thought about the absurd amount of work it takes to be a person who is not ruled by their fear and who is still allowed to often look silly. The ducks came close enough for her to pretend she wasn\u2019t looking at them, then turned away as if they had seen an invitation in the next reflection in the water. Her body made its reliable notes and then softened them. When her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number that turned out to be the girl from Laila\u2019s class\u2014\u201cI told a boy to move his shoulder and he moved it and the bolt listened to me and I laughed in my head until I cried\u201d\u2014Nour felt that light bruise of joy she had grown accustomed to carrying, the one that arrived whenever a machine obeyed and whenever somebody reached past the easy story someone else had written for them.\n\nThe week decided it had been generous enough and sent in a small incident as if to balance the ledger. A fleet driver, in a hurry to be somewhere his supervisor had described as urgent, backed too close to the open door of the workshop and kissed it with the bumper. The sound rang through the room with the clang of a bell someone had not meant to ring. Everyone made the faces of people who had anticipated an accident in their bones all morning. The door creaked like an old woman asked to dance and then settled at an angle that made Arif swear quietly because he didn\u2019t like when things fell away from square. They propped it with a jack and used new bolts and old tricks, and the driver apologized with the extravagance of a man who has just realized how far favors can be withdrawn. Nour worked alongside Arif in a silence that was not sullen and not quite peaceful, her hands the steady counsel of muscle memory. When they finished, Arif clapped her shoulder in a way that might later have grown a speech if he had been a different man. \u201cYou must go home and sleep tonight,\u201d he said instead, the kind of sentence that needs no flourish in a city that teaches you to hurry. \u201cYour brain will think you are a superhero. Let it become stupid. Then it will behave for me tomorrow.\u201d\n\nShe intended to obey. She intended to sleep like a person who had deserved it. Instead, at midnight, her phone lit with Farid\u2019s name and a message that used too many words for him to hide good news inside it. He had found a mistake in an assumption they had been treating like a rock, a tiny miscalculation in thermal expansion that would, if left untended, turn into a kind of betrayal during a hot noon test in a place like Liwa. He had rewritten the page with a pen that made his handwriting aggressive. \u201cI would like not to be the man who saved you by being a bore,\u201d he wrote with a care that made Nour\u2019s throat ache unexpectedly. \u201cI prefer to be boring and to keep your every finger attached.\u201d She wrote back something that teased his eyebrows into a smile in her head and promised a morning with calipers and a guilty fitting. Sleep came not as a gift but as a pause inserted by a body reaching its limit without her permission.\n\nIn the dream that carried her, she stood in the workshop with the ceiling fan turned off and the quiet so complete she could hear the heat radiate. The duck entered\u2014of course it did\u2014but it was wearing around its neck a small string of nuts like someone trying to carry their tools without hands. Soraya leaned in the doorway with her hands dirty the way Nour liked them best and said, \u201cWe have threaded the wrong fear,\u201d and Mina said from a stool she hadn\u2019t been sitting on when Nour walked in, \u201cWe can unthread it,\u201d and Arif argued with a poet about torque, and her father sat on the hood of a car he would never have been allowed to own, smoking a cigarette he would have promised he had quit, and said to her very plainly, \u201cAsk for the wrench you want,\u201d and in the dream Nour did, and when she woke the sentence sat on her tongue like a coin she could spend that very day.\n\nBy the time the sun climbed the face of Wednesday, she was at the lab with the fitting Farid distrusted and the gloves Laila had gifted and a loaf of bread from Soraya that turned out to be perfect in slices and terrible at restraint. Farid pointed to the numbers as if pointing to a pickpocket leaving the room. Habib held the part like a small animal and told it the story of its future. Maryam leaned over the printout and took a picture because sometimes you needed proof later that you had known the truth early. Soraya watched Nour\u2019s hands as if she\u2019d forgotten how hands make you brave, and Nour let herself be watched. They shaved a sliver from the assumption and filed another from pride. The part fit the way a sentence fits in a mouth when you have learned to say it without tripping. At noon, the call came from the glossy magazine asking for a quote and Soraya said, without irony and without explanation, \u201cWe work small because we want to be big later without dying,\u201d and Nour added, \u201cWe check until checking is part of our bone,\u201d and the young woman on the phone said, \u201cShould I really write the word bone,\u201d and then laughed because she was not ready to be in the room with that kind of real.\n\nLate afternoon, the sky bruised purple in a way Nour had always liked, and she found herself at the sink washing her hands slowly enough to admire, not for the first time, the way grease left reluctantly the way some fears do. Her phone beeped a new message from an old friend who had moved to Canada and had started posting pictures of trees that pretended to be authors. \u201cI miss the heat,\u201d the friend wrote, as if she were confessing something indecent. \u201cI miss the way the city makes you earn evening.\u201d Nour typed back a photograph of the workshop\u2019s door at an angle, the repaired seam visible like a scar and as honorable, and wrote, \u201cWe learn to love the thing after it breaks and then is mended correctly,\u201d and her friend sent three hearts and then a long story about how in their new city ducks were a menace and Nour laughed out loud, alone, in a room full of machines that hadn\u2019t laughed yet, and thought, look how far a story can walk and still return.\n\nWhen she closed up, after Arif had done his ritual of counting money and disappointment and after Bassam had put away the rag he always forgot until the last minute, Nour stepped into the hallway that led to the world and nearly tripped over a small cardboard box left beside the elevator. On top of it, a note in unfamiliar handwriting read, in careful Arabic that wore its practice proudly, \u201cFor the woman who is not bread.\u201d Inside were three small bags of duck feed with a drawing of a mallard looking judgmental and, underneath, a mechanic\u2019s glove in a size that was actually hers. She stood there with her mouth tipping toward a laugh and a softness that felt like someone pressing the heel of their hand briefly against the pulse in her throat. The security guard from the gate\u2014who had taught himself to joke with dignity and who had once warned her about quacking forever\u2014peeked around the corner like a child who hadn\u2019t decided whether to run away or be congratulated. \u201cMy wife said the joke was not nice,\u201d he blurted, the sentences tumbling as if they were in a race. \u201cShe saw me put that paper and she said, shame, you are a father, so I brought this. Maybe your ducks eat this and leave you alone. Maybe you will give the glove to someone who deserves it. I did not know your size but I remembered your hands.\u201d Nour put the box down carefully before she did something that would embarrass both of them, like cry or adopt him. \u201cShukran,\u201d she said, and the word had weight, and he bowed with the dignity that comes from being a man who has corrected himself in front of witnesses.\n\nUpstairs, her mother had left the balcony door open again and the lace curtain performed its old theater. The television had decided on a program where a man in a white coat yelled at a bowl of rice. On the table sat a fat aubergine that looked like it knew a secret. Her mother lifted it like a trophy and announced that tomorrow they would burn it directly on the gas the old way, not the fussy way, and Nour said in a voice heavier with contentment than she had expected, \u201cBurn it until it learns to be sweet,\u201d and her mother\u2019s eyebrows lifted in approval because she liked when her daughter found an analogy she could put in her pocket and take to a conversation with an aunt.\n\nThe night had scraped one star clean of haze when Soraya texted, an unguarded line that barely kept its lungs from the page. \u201cYou asked for the wrench you wanted,\u201d she wrote without preamble, as if she had been in the dream with the cigarette and the crook in the bookshelf. \u201cWhat did you get.\u201d Nour typed, then deleted, then typed again, learned from her engines that sometimes torque had to be gradual or you stripped the threads. \u201cA day,\u201d she sent finally. \u201cA day where I stand in a room that used to be a fight and I bend metal and make heat behave and someone brings me humor in a box and you steal me to stairwells to ask for miracles and I remember my father\u2019s voice without pretending it was always wise. I got that wrench.\u201d The dots pulsed\u2014Soraya, thinking how to answer without flinching\u2014and then the reply arrived, plain, as dry as the desert that had become generous to them, \u201cKeep it near.\u201d",

Abu Dhabi still did its morning theatrics\u2014call to prayer stitched through the air like a silver thread, buses yawning awake, shop shutters rattling their bones\u2014but Nour felt a greasy hinge in herself had been oiled. At the workshop, the smell of last night\u2019s rain sat lightly on the threshold like a polite guest who would leave before lunch. Arif made a show of sweeping water toward a drain that had always been there and never worked, while Bassam held a hair dryer over a fuse box as if he were talking sense into a stubborn uncle. In the corner, the box the security guard had left with the duck feed and the glove had been repurposed to hold rags, and on the inside flap someone\u2014not Bassam, his handwriting was cockier\u2014had written, in careful block letters, her name. She didn\u2019t correct the reverence of it; names written on cardboard were as holy as names written anywhere else if they found the right eyes to impress.\n\nThe magazine piece crawled into the world with the morning like a shy animal and then pretended it had always belonged there. It showed Soraya and Nour at the edge of a stand in Al Khatm, the ribbon of cable dressed nice for the camera, Farid\u2019s eyebrows trimmed by the crop of a photo editor, Habib\u2019s hands stoically cut out of the frame as if hands made people nervous. The text wore its adjectives like guests at a wedding not sure where to stand, but the quotes sounded like them because they had refused to translate too much. Her mother read it three times and each time made a different face\u2014pride the first, suspicion the second, a third expression Nour had not seen before that was a little like grief and a little like admiration that had forgotten to perform. A cousin sent a voice note that consisted entirely of squeals and the line, \u201cYa Allah, you look like money,\u201d which was unintentionally the most practical compliment anyone had paid them. Kareem texted a picture of the page laid on a table beside one of his grandfather\u2019s teacups, the cup\u2019s rim crazed with delicate cracks like a map of a tiny country that had decided to be beautiful about its age, and added, \u201cI like your sentence about working small because you want to be big later without dying.\u201d She typed \u201ccopyright Farid\u2019s eyebrows\u201d and deleted it and sent instead a duck emoji and a wrench, not because it meant anything but because emojis sometimes understood better that meaning could be a long corridor and not a tight room.\n\nMoney called with its mouth half full. A logistics company wanted their logo near the stand and their name in a paragraph that would be read under air-conditioning by men who bought golf clubs they never used. A man in a suit the color of compromise came to the lab with a suggestion about how to make the rocket \u201cfriendlier for families,\u201d as if it were a dessert on a menu. Soraya smiled with both kindness and steel and asked him where he wanted to stand during a test and if he had a favorite distance from the spray of grit when combustion remembered who it was meant to be. He laughed thinly and said his niece liked pink, and Nour had to look away to prevent the look on her face from becoming a story someone else would tell as proof women were difficult. Farid sent a message that had only three words\u2014no brand near flame\u2014and a list of regulation clauses that could be waved like a small polite sword if needed. Habib weighed a quick-release clamp in his palm while the man talked and afterward said, in a voice so even it counted as respect, that sometimes the only friendship worth discussing was between metal and math.\n\nAt night, when Abu Dhabi did its glittering imitation of a lake, Nour walked to the corner grocery where the owner liked her because she bought things that made sense\u2014oil, bread, dates, two onions\u2014and did not ask him for absurd fruits that had traveled farther than some people. The owner asked about the rocket and she told him the rocket had opinions and was learning to keep them to itself for three seconds at a time. On the way back, a thin cat with a white mustache escorted her for twenty meters and then left with no farewell, which she respected. At home, her mother folded laundry with the air of a general arranging troops, the bedsheet snapping into a straight line with a little zero-g flourish. \u201cKareem\u2019s grandmother likes you,\u201d she offered as if she were handing over a small, well-balanced tool. \u201cShe said your hands are honest. She said you will not make her son into a liar.\u201d\n\nNour took the pillowcase and the compliment and put both away where they would not be misplaced. \u201cI like that his grandmother sleeps after lunch,\u201d she said, because that had impressed her\u2014an old woman who did not apologize for taking rest where the day thought it had rights over her. \u201cI like that she told him not to call her from the train because she can hear the motion and it makes her want to be inside it.\u201d Her mother nodded, approving of women who had the courage to deny love\u2019s interruptions. Then, as if she were changing the oil in a story, she drew a breath and delivered, with a deliberately offhand tone, the news that a neighbor\u2019s son was moving to Canada and had a position waiting for him as an engineer in a place where snow was a mood, not a novelty. The insertion was a test of the emergency system in Nour\u2019s chest; the alarms blinked and then went back to steady because she had nothing to declare at customs yet, nothing to declare to herself at least in front of her mother. \u201cCanada is a quilt,\u201d Nour said, watching her mother\u2019s face in the reflection of the window. \u201cPeople love quilts when they\u2019re under them and curse them when they try to fold them into an overhead compartment.\u201d\n\nThe university added another hoop to their small circus: a demonstration for a visiting committee who had money and wanted an attitude to match. Soraya wrote the date on the whiteboard as if she were writing down the name of a woman she would not love and would nonetheless be polite to. Farid circled it with a broken oval that looked like it might choose to release them at any moment. Maryam insisted on a drill that had them move through three failure modes in a row without losing their humor\u2014a kind of rehearsal for grief turning into jokes and back again. Habib found a man who used to deliver air conditioners in the back of pickup trucks and had figured out the right way to strap a thing so it did not develop ambitions while you drove; he showed them a knot that looked like nothing and then refused to come undone with the obstinacy of a good marriage. Nour took the knot into her body with that particular pleasure that only mechanics and grandmothers feel when they recognize an economy that can save a life without calling attention to itself.\n\nThere are weeks when a city only touches your shoulder as it passes, and there are weeks when it taps your forehead with fervor and insists you wake up into a different arrangement. Wednesday was a tapper. A man from the supplier in Mussafah called with the voice of someone who had misplaced his dignity under a pile of invoices and said, almost sheepishly, that the regulator that was like the others but not quite like the others\u2014the one Farid had wanted as a backup for a backup\u2014had been \u201cmiscounted into a truck\u201d and now sat on a shelf in a warehouse with a lock whose key had gone to Al Ain in a pocket with other keys. Soraya closed her eyes like a person hearing a joke that wasn\u2019t funny yet and then said they would drive, because there were days when you stepped into your own inconvenience and made it small by moving through it. Nour grabbed her bag with the wrench she loved and the bread she\u2019d stolen from Soraya that morning in case the world punished her for greedy sweets, and told Arif, who lifted two fingers in a blessing disguised as a insult and said if they brought back the wrong metal he would make them eat it.\n\nThe drive toward Al Ain at dusk peeled the day into long strips of color that clung to the road\u2019s edge. Trucks hunched in the slow lane like animals who knew better than to challenge a predator. Soraya drove with the patience of a person who had learned to carry two speeds in her skull: the one the car did and the one her blood preferred. They spoke of nothing for long stretches because silence sometimes did the kindness of believing you after you\u2019ve lied all day. Then, as if a switch had been hit by a toe under a table, Soraya asked in a voice that was trying to be casual and could not, \u201cDo you think my love of this is a good enough reason to build my life around it. Sometimes I am afraid that that is the poorest argument and the richest too.\u201d\n\nNour let the words rattle around her ribs, watched their shapes against her breath. \u201cI think love is a terrible reason until it is the only one that holds when every other reason leaves the room,\u201d she said, choosing them slowly because careless words in a moving car could do as much damage as careless hands. \u201cI think we pretend we want better reasons because wanting is dangerous in public. If you told the dean you wanted your name on a plaque he would respect you more than if you told him you want heat to do what you tell it to for three seconds without breaking your heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlaques are for men with shoes that sound expensive in hallways,\u201d Soraya said, a laugh tapping the underside of her annoyance. \u201cI want three seconds because three seconds is a container I can fill. I have always liked containers I can fill.\u201d She took a hand off the wheel and flexed it, a habit that meant anxiety had tried on her bones and found them too tight. \u201cAlso, sometimes I ask myself if I am a bad person for wanting you and the rocket and not knowing whether wanting them together means I am pretending the universe will treat me gently because I deserve it. The universe,\u201d she added, as if she were arguing with a matriarch, \u201cdoes not give a fig about deserving.\u201d\n\nThe honesty landed like a tool dropping exactly where it should without pinching a finger. Nour looked at the road and then at Soraya\u2019s cheekbone where the dusk made a quiet lake, and felt the whole embarrassment of being alive and wanting things that did not come on a parts list. She did not reach for Soraya\u2019s hand because the car was a small room and the world a complicated country, and also because wanting with care was a skill she was newly committed to practicing. \u201cI do not know who the good people are,\u201d she said, which was true in more categories than just love. \u201cI know who the people with better safety protocols are. I know that when I want you and the rocket in the same sentence, I become more careful with my bolts. Maybe that is all the morality we can afford just now.\u201d\n\nThey found the gate with the borrowed key by way of a night guard who had invented his own bureaucracy and a smell of cardboard altered by fear. The regulator sat on a shelf like a complicated fruit, quiet and almost apologetic. Soraya carried it to the car with two hands as if it were a child she had not told she was leaving with, and Nour opened the door for it like a grandmother who had decided to be ceremonial. On the way back, a camel drifted across the road with the dignity of a ship. Soraya braked as if they had rehearsed it, hands steady, words blasphemous and loving, and the camel looked at them with a straight-on disdain Nour wished she could cultivate and then moved on as if it had accepted their apology for existing.\n\nIn the lab the next day, the regulator nestled into its seat with an obedience that made everyone distrust it just enough. Farid hovered with a caliper and the look of a man who had already composed an apology he would not need to give. Maryam watched the door, because someone always has to watch the door when ten hands are near the hot thing. Habib told a story about the last time a man brought him a part with paperwork so long he had to read it while stirring his tea so it wouldn\u2019t get lonely. Soraya and Nour worked shoulder to shoulder without touching shoulders, a dance that was beginning to feel like its own language. When it was done, when the numbers on the laptop didn\u2019t make any emergency shapes and the smallest sound in the room came from the cheap clock on the wall which had always thought it was a metronome in an orchestra, Soraya said, \u201cMy mother wanted me to be a dentist because she thought mouths were more cooperative than machines,\u201d and Nour said, \u201cMouths lie more,\u201d and Habib said, \u201cMachines lie too, they just don\u2019t pretend it\u2019s a favor.\u201d\n\nFriday put its hands on the city\u2019s shoulders and shook it gently back into a sense of order. The demonstration for the committee took place under a tent that believed in its responsibility to boss the air, which it did not. Men with ties and women with clipboards arranged themselves along a rope line like pearls deciding where to sit. There were children in this crowd too, and Nour felt the tug in her ribs she had begun to accept would simply be part of her whenever a small person\u2019s small hands got near noise. Farid ran through his bored mantra with religious fervor. Maryam placed extinguishers like punctuation marks. Soraya checked and checked and then pretended she was the kind of person who did not check so she could stand up straight and talk like a person who knows joy but has chose to be professional. Nour went around behind the stand to the small corner where the thin cable displayed its modest loyalty, and in the shade there found the boy with the striped shirt from the marina, his hair combed into good behavior, his eyes already picking apart the day for secrets.\n\n\u201cMy father said we came to see your baby rocket,\u201d he informed her without preamble. \u201cHe said if it cries we have to clap.\u201d His father, behind him, wore an expression of a man trying to be casual about believing in strangers. Nour knelt because the corner smelled like sand and opportunity. \u201cIt will not cry,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it cries we are going to give it a nap.\u201d The boy considered this with seriousness and then took from his pocket a crumbly biscuit which he examined and put back without offering. He looked at the stand and then at her. \u201cAre you afraid,\u201d he asked, with the cruelty innocence has when it lands exactly on the right question.\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d she said, because you could not make adults honest if you wouldn\u2019t practice on children. \u201cBut I am also in love with our obeyed equations and the way my friends\u2019 eyebrows can keep us alive.\u201d He nodded, satisfied with the cadence even if the content slid past him, as children\u2019s acceptance often operates more on music than meaning. He pointed to a dove on the edge of the tent pole and advised it not to be stupid in a whisper he thought only the bird could hear, then squeezed his father\u2019s hand in a quality of gratitude that made Nour look away until she could come back to the day without wanting to cry.\n\nThe ignition was a lesson in how well a body can be two things at once. The engine asserted its flame, the stand held its role, the tether stayed put because it had been asked sincerely, and the small cylinder kissed the air with a motion that was neither panic nor laziness. It hovered, a little, the way a prayer does in the moment before it becomes air, and then it settled with a small grateful thump, like someone sitting back down after remembering something they had forgotten on the stove. The crowd made the noise crowds make when they have witnessed a miracle they can explain to themselves later as an inevitability. Soraya\u2019s face opened briefly to a kind of happiness Nour had not seen since the small times when you convince bread to have the exact texture you wanted. Farid exhaled drama he hadn\u2019t wanted to inhale. Habib said okay aloud to a god nobody in particular believed in but everyone liked to thank when nothing burned.\n\nAfter, the committee members asked questions that skimmed the surface of competence like stones behaving. One of them, round and nervous and with a smile he couldn\u2019t control, asked Nour about the part she liked least in a combustion cycle, and she answered in a way that made his relief patent; he had expected jargon and got a sentence he could repeat later with pride. Another asked Soraya why this, why now, why here, and Soraya\u2019s answer made the words small economy and big horizon sit next to each other without fighting. The boy in the striped shirt clapped anyway, late and alone, and Nour marched her hands to join him.\n\nWhen the tent folded, when the photographs were done and the flattery had been distributed in measured spoons, Nour went home and napped the way people in her family napped: with thirty minutes of sincerity. She woke to her mother\u2019s hand on her ankle, the soft squeeze intended to return her to a body before the brain took liberties. \u201cDinner,\u201d her mother announced, \u201cis a story about an aubergine that wanted to be smoke and then remembered it is also a fruit.\u201d They ate barefoot in the small living room where the rug resented the weather and pretended it was a different season. The TV narrated a match; the commentator sounded like a man who could guide a rocket through turbulence with sheer linguistic force. Midway through the meal, her mother glanced at her over the rim of a glass of water and said, without the preliminary negotiation she usually requires, \u201cYour father used to be afraid of balconies.\u201d\n\nThe sentence sounded like the first line of a book Nour would buy. She put the spoon down and waited because the story needed its legs to move by themselves. Her mother considered the window and the city\u2019s edge snipped out of it. \u201cHe was not afraid when anyone else was looking,\u201d she continued, picking aubergine skin from her teeth with a nail she had always meant to stop using for such work. \u201cHe would smoke like a movie star and make jokes about the men in the next building who could never find the right football channel. But when the house was quiet he closed the door because he had dreams where the balcony misbehaved. He never told anyone except me, and I only tell you because you tell me your ducks have learned to behave and I am proud of you and I am also not proud of myself for making jokes about you being afraid when perhaps you inherited something and made it into art.\u201d\n\nNour took that like a pill that was also a perfume. She wanted to close her eyes because the softness of her mother when she admitted failure was a rare metal. \u201cHis fear,\u201d she said, tasting it. \u201cHe wore it differently.\u201d Her mother nodded, agreeing with a sentence only mothers get to approve. \u201cHe wore it like a shirt under the shirt,\u201d she said. \u201cHe taught you to love bolts because bolts keep things attached to the world. He taught you to look at edges. He taught you\u2014maybe without wanting to\u2014to knock the doorframe before you go through it. I want you to keep the parts he meant to give you and forgive the ones he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Kareem sent a message that he was going to Sharjah for a month to make sure a team that did not trust him would learn to pretend to, and he asked whether she might come to see the yard before he left. She went, because the yard had rust and metal and stories that did not require formality. They walked between old engines like tourists in an ancient city. He told her the history of a coupling with the reverence of a man speaking about family, and she listened, not because she felt obligated to but because he had learned to render his expertise without making it a weapon. At the end of the walk, he stood near a derail and did a brave thing; he told her straight that he liked the way she sat inside her life and that he thought he had the hunger to sit with her there, but that he would not ask her to break any part to make room for him and he would not pretend to be unafraid of women who did not need saving. She liked him the way a well-made key likes an honest lock. She told him she didn\u2019t know\u2014about the part where love made a shape in her that would accommodate both rocket and Kareem, about the part where wanting Soraya didn\u2019t fit cleanly into any of her mother\u2019s categories or her own\u2014and he smiled and said the trains would be waiting, which was both a joke and a mercy.\n\nMina\u2019s studio smelled of orange peel and the kind of quiet that only exists in rooms where you recognize the furniture and the furniture recognizes you. Nour lay down and told the ceiling in a voice that tried to be bored that ducks had learned not to dim the room and that today the fear wore different clothes and maybe asked to be called by a more expensive name, like uncertainty or longing. Mina, who wore patience like a cardigan, moved her hands through the air with the seriousness some people reserve for bank transfers and said the thing that felt like a tool you could put into your pocket and take to a machine: \u201cYou can give two loves different chairs and teach them to nod politely when the other speaks.\u201d It wasn\u2019t an answer. Answers were for forms. It was a choreography and it would have to be enough.\n\nThe next time they went out to the desert, they brought fewer jokes and more water. Liwa had shifted again; dunes are worse than men for thinking they can decide what looks good without consulting anyone. Farid walked the line of the intended flight like a priest deciding where to put the sacrificial goat. Habib greeted his cousin with the complicated softness of Bedouin hospitality and the relief of a man who\u2019d been forgiven a debt he hadn\u2019t incurred. Soraya whistled tunelessly and then apologized to the wind for trying to conduct it. Nour had brought the glove from the box and fitted it like a new word. They did their checks and then did them again because the air was thick and people get sloppy when a place insists on showing off its beauty. The ignition lacked drama, which was in itself a kind of drama; the machine did as instructed, and the tetherless lift\u2014still small, still the length of a breath held and then let go\u2014didn\u2019t pretend to be more than a start. Nour felt the ache of that modesty in her bones. She wanted the big leap, the long sentence. She had learned to love commas.\n\nAfter, the men sat in the scrap of shade and admired the color of the sand as if it were a new suit on an old friend. Maryam lectured briefly on hydration and told a story about a man who had almost been saved by a bottle of water he had been too proud to accept, and everyone nodded because a little shame kept most people civilized. Farid announced, almost begrudgingly, that he was satisfied for now, which made Soraya lean over and draw eyebrows on the back of his hand with a pen. Habib\u2019s cousin yelled at a camel with the affection in his voice tight as a scarf. Nour tilted her head back and watched a bird make a line she could not calculate and felt, for a long moment that felt like a break in the day\u2019s spine, that she had arrived in a life that was listening. She let the feeling sit there without breathing on it too hard.\n\nIn the days that followed, the city resumed its argument with itself about being a machine or an animal. A new sign appeared by the Corniche with a picture of a duck inside a red circle and an explanation about disease and mess and municipal dignity, and Nour laughed once, softly, alone, and then took a picture and sent it to the boy\u2019s father with a note that read, \u201cWe will obey\u2014tell him to give his speeches to the wind.\u201d Laila made them disassemble a braking system twice because the first time they were smug and the second they were just right. Arif negotiated with a supplier who wanted to be paid in favors and was denied, with interest. Bassam got engaged and walked around the workshop like a man who had remembered where he\u2019d put his heart and was embarrassed by how dusty it had gotten. Her mother bought a dress and then decided not to wear it because the woman in the mirror looked like someone else whom she did not trust, and Nour told her she looked like a victory and did not lie.\n\nOne evening, when the heat did not want to unclench its grip, Nour opened the small metal box her father had once called his bank and found inside a receipt for a set of wrenches bought the week she was born, the ink bleached to polite gray. On the backside, in his chaotic handwriting that had convinced teachers to be kind, he had written the names of his daughters and the date he had learned how to quiet a radiator without replacing it. The combination of their two names and a trick felt like a poem he hadn\u2019t known he wrote. She took a photograph and sent it to her sister in Sharjah, who sent in return a picture of a sun hat and three children eating popsicles badly, and Nour filed the receipt back into the bank because she liked the idea of a past that sometimes earns interest too.\n\nWhen the next week\u2019s plan sprouted on the whiteboard, Soraya wrote \u201cliwa long\u201d and then erased \u201clong\u201d because she had learned that length is not a favor the world grants you because you have been good. She replaced it with \u201cclean,\u201d which Farid underlined without sarcasm. They would go earlier, they would bring a bigger tent, they would not invite the man with his niece who liked pink, they would feed themselves before they forgot and then tried to substitute sugar for a meal. Nour looked at the list and saw the shape of her days, the hard and soft, the way the city put its mouth to her ear and told her things she would not write down but would use. She sent a message to Kareem wishing him more trains than delays and he sent back a photograph of a nameplate on a carriage that read \u201cpatience,\u201d because someone in a paint shop had gotten a little poetic. She told Mina she had kept her fear in one room all week and Mina wrote, \u201cInvite it for tea sometimes or it will scratch the door,\u201d which felt rude and correct. She tucked her father\u2019s receipt into the pocket of her bag, a ritual that was less superstition than agreement with her own heart that sometimes paper could be a friend.\n\nOn the last night before they were to leave again for the dunes, after she had put the bread into a bag and checked the torque wrench twice and plugged in her phone as if she could charge the day ahead like a battery, Nour stood at the small balcony and watched a bulbul fixing its hair in the reflection of the glass. The city spread itself, glittering, and the wind skimmed a hand across the tops of the palms like a person walking down a hallway touching every door. Her mother came out with two cups of tea and a rumour about someone\u2019s cousin\u2019s daughter who had married a man in Al Ain who didn\u2019t deserve her and improved his life anyway. They drank quietly. Somewhere a boy dribbled a basketball badly and someone\u2019s laugh made a ladder up a stairwell. Nour thought of the first duck and the latest flame, of the boy\u2019s diplomacy on the dock and the security guard\u2019s crooked mea culpa, of Soraya\u2019s careful light and Farid\u2019s fussy love, of Habib\u2019s desert patience and Maryam\u2019s no-nonsense tenderness, of Laila\u2019s braid and Mina\u2019s fountain, of her mother\u2019s old battles and her father\u2019s secret balconies. She stood in the chain of all that and felt the weight of it, then the balance, and let the night close around her not as a corridor but as a courtyard where everyone knew which chair was theirs and could swap if someone came late and wanted to sit.",
