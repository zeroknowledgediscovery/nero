There are ring roads in Basingstoke that never end. They peel around the town like loosened belts—one, two, three—bearing caravans and delivery lorries and the same bus that always smells faintly of oranges. In the wet, the white lines float on the shin of the tarmac and the cars hiss like snakes. In the wet, I would rather vanish.

I kept to the shopfronts that morning, dodging the gutters because the gutters gurgled. A loose downpour had come in off the chalk, and even the pigeons under the eaves looked like they were thinking it over. My name is Orrin Pell. I am a worlock, by blood and by the stubborn habit of staying alive. I am afraid of water.

The fear is not poetry. It has no shape but the shape of me at six years old, swallowing river, bemused by the cold, bewildered by how long a breath can seem if it is the last. It’s ridiculous and intractable. I can bind cinders into a bird and send it across half a town, I can fold a whisper into a pocket and trade it for a favor, and I cannot cross a footbridge without counting the boards and measuring the distance between my soles and the water and wishing the river would forget I exist.

There is the River Loddon, which loops like a quiet idea to the east. A scrap of canal, a garden fountain clogged by leaves in October. Rain. The worst of it is the rain, because it laughs at roofs and coats and drops inside your collar with a cold finger and touches your spine like an old friend.

Aunt Bet said, “You’ll be late for graves if you keep dancing along like that,” when I came in to her shop, wet to the edges but not at the middle. I have tricks for that. You make a little thread-thin wall around yourself and the rain splits, uncertain of your body. It’s not much, and it makes the air taste of iron filings, but it keeps the collarbone dry. Aunt Bet pulled a pin from her bun and set it in the jar labeled THISTLES, as if it were a thistle and not a pin.

“What graves?” I asked. I peeled my hood back but kept close to the door, where the draft knew me.

“The boy from Popley you promised to find, or have you forgotten?” She took a broom to a spill of dried herbs on the floor. The labels all had hand-written capitals that leaned to the left, like they were going somewhere without you. Eglantine, rue, skullcap, a whisper of deadly nightshade that we had no license to sell and also sold to no one with a beating heart.

“I didn’t promise, I was subtly coerced,” I said, because she had put her hand on my head and said, There, now you’re promising. I keep my promises like people keep dogs. A look says: you belong.

“His mother came twice,” Bet said. “She left biscuits and a photograph and a story about a gnome that walks the lines at night.”

“People will do that,” I muttered. I am not a finder of children. I am a mover of luck. When your shop goes cold, I can bring heat to it; when your name turns sour in mouths, I can sweeten it; when you cannot sleep, I can kill the dreams you do not want and leave the ones you do. There are others of us who search—sleek men with rods, women with clear eyes and dogs—but Aunt Bet had accepted the biscuits like contracts and set the picture by my seat.

The picture was a cropped bit of world in which a boy of nine wore a school jumper and a smile that wasn’t sure of itself. He stood on the edge of Bloswood Lane, it looked like, where the hedges punch up from the earth like fists in summer. On his left wrist, a plaited thread bracelet you could buy from a girl with a cardboard sign outside the Anvil. Leah makes them, the sign might have said. Or maybe Maya. I should have known.

“Where?” I was already looking for the map inside my head.

“Down by Mill Field. Near the river,” Bet said, and her eyes slid to my collar. They were cloudy in one corner where an old spell had taken root and then died. “Bring salt.”

“Salt for what?”

“For the water,” she said, like one says: Do not forget to bring your lungs.

— — —

There are fields on the east side of the town where the grass leans like it is under an old, slow wind that never quite arrives. We call them Mill Field though the mill’s long gone to photographs and tea towels. The path squelches in winter. In spring there are little flowers that pretend to be brave. A dog barks somewhere you can’t see it. There are always dogs. They know everything and will trade you all of it for a biscuit.

I brought salt; a bright paper packet from the shop and a little tin of rock-salt I use when I make circles I can stand inside and breathe better.

Near the bend where the willows start to throw their hair down over the water, the air was cold in that way that isn’t weather, that is departure. I crouched by the board that said NO SWIMMING A CHILD DROWNED HERE 1973 and traced the wood with a dry finger. I will not touch the water if I can help it. The river was running high and brown and I thought it looked like tea with too much milk, which is to say: like something gentle that will kill you if it likes.

“Leah?” I said, because names are the first line on the page and sometimes if you say them the rest of the story prints itself.

“Leah’s a girl’s name,” said a voice behind me. I started and the salt packet burst in my pocket. I left it there. It felt like carrying a tiny white sky.

The voice belonged to a man holding a cheap umbrella with a logo for a kitchen company. He wore a coat that had once belonged to someone with money. He had the look that persists in our town, the look of someone who knows the back path to the bypass. He did not show me his hands.

“That true?” I said. “Then tell me his name.”

He tilted the umbrella so a foot of rain poured off it and clapped onto the path, a roar I wanted to run from. “Daniel. Dan. He liked boats.”

I swallowed; it was reflexive, it was a swallow at the sound of a word tearing silk inside my head. “And who are you?”

“Somebody who doesn’t fancy you putting your nose where an older nose was put and bitten off,” he said, and smiled.

“Say it with your chest,” I suggested, though I kept my eyes at his feet, at the edge of the path, at the place where the mud turned slick and the earth shrugged like a shoulder. I am not a fighter in the way the movies want us to fight, which is to say: always and with knives. I am a worlock. A fist does not obey me. A shadow does. If you can name the wind in a room, you can turn it. If you can sketch the idea of a blade in the air, you can cut paper with it—but not skin, not unless you mean to bleed.

He bent and picked up a twig and snapped it with theatrical care. “Say it with your chest,” he echoed, and the twig made a sound like my name.

“I have work,” I said. “Move along.”

“What if I don’t?”

“Then you stand too long and you start to grow moss,” I said levelly, and he snorted and went, because he had been sent to delay, not to fight, and it is a particular man who throws himself into a river of words when he knows he cannot swim.

When he was gone, I took the tin of rock-salt out and poured a circle as if I were drawing a halo on the earth for myself. I set my feet inside it. My breath slowed. I counted in a language my grandmother taught me. I counted and with each number spread in my mouth like a leaf. I am a worlock with a fear, not a fear with a brain. Sometimes you say it. Sometimes it listens.

“Dan,” I said to the river, “this is Orrin Pell, I’m a worlock by trade. I am not here to take anything. I’m returning the right to be found.”

River water does not answer because it cannot be bothered. But the willows shook their arms a little and the reeds made a dry sound and a fish somewhere turned a thought over. That’s enough. I reached into my coat and drew out the boy’s picture and the plaited bracelet, soaked now, slate-dark. I held them in my palm. I would have given one finger to be wearing gloves but you don’t pass a thread while you’re gloved, it slips.

“Walk with me,” I said. “Walk with me and show me where you walked.”

The picture grew colder in my hand. The wet has a voice; you have to agree it’s a voice or you’ll miss the words. Shhh, shhh, it went, and there was a bit of laughter, just in the marrow. Something pulled. My right heel lifted and my blood became aware of gravity and the same old iron hook snagged the meat of my lungs as the river’s breath blew over the skin of my face.

I stepped back. The salt circle smudged and closed behind me like a curtain. You don’t know how close your body can come to leaving you until you are called by the thing that made you afraid. The tin slipped from my hand and went into the mud with a sound like a last word.

“Not today,” I said out loud. I had the taste of pennies in my mouth. “Not your way.”

Another voice said, “He can’t hear you from where he is, you know.” A woman’s voice, dry. She had stood behind the alder tree perhaps since dawn, very still, waiting. She does that kind of waiting, the kind that reads as patience and is actually economy. She wore a coat the color of rain and hair that moved only if she decided to breathe.

“People keep appearing,” I said. “It’s almost as if we are in a story set in a popular place.”

She smiled, very little. “Do you want help? It’s too much for you.”

I looked at her and saw the thing only we see; the twist at the edge of her left eye where a lesser binding had been tied for a long time and then scooped off by a rough hand. Worlock. Not mine. Not my family or the next of them. Not the sort who brings luck to a shop. The kind that reads in the raw. She had a glint in her thumb for slicing, for cutting what is tangled quickly.

“No,” I lied. “Thank you.”

“You’re the Pell boy,” she said, ignoring my lie.

“I’m the Pell man. It’s different and it isn’t.” I stooped and picked up my tin from the mud, knocked it against my boot, which was pretending to be leather.

“You should come away from there. He’s tied to something that breathes,” she said.

“Who is?” I said, though I knew who.

“Aurelian Crowl,” she said, and she watched my mouth when I said the name with her, as if timing our breath. “He’s got his clever hands on whatever Dan touched last. It widens his reach.”

The name went through me like a wick catching. I had heard it, in other mouths and other places; whispered and spat and written with biro in a bus shelter that had been scrubbed of every other ink. He belonged to stories that do not end well.

“You know Crowl?” I tried to make the word a pebble, something to spit out.

“I know the people who are standing in his shade,” she said. “My name is Elna. I think you should not go further into the mud. I think you’ll die trying, and I don’t have the energy to drag your body out and make the police like me about it.”

“I wasn’t going to,” I said and I was not sure until the breath after it whether I had been going to or not. “How did he take him?”

“A phone game, a test in maths, a poem in his ear that went on and on until he stepped into the long tide and didn’t find the cuff of his mother’s voice. They are all the same story. He is practicing on the small ones because the small ones answer quickest.” Elna’s eyes were flat like slate. “He has found a way to bind the wet.”

“Good for him,” I said, and heard the shake in my little words. “I’ll—”

“You’ll bring salt,” she said. “You’ll wrap the wet. You’ll tie it to the dry.” She glanced at the bracelet in my barred hand. “You’ll make it speak.”

“I hate it,” I said. It slipped out of my mouth with the easy gait of truth.

“I know,” she said. “Come away. Let me buy you a cup of coffee so you can feel better for five minutes and then worse for a day.”

We walked back along the path. On the bridge I counted: one, two, three, board, board, six. She did not ask why. She didn’t say my fear out loud the way some people do, as if naming the dog will stop it barking. In the distance the A33 carried its river of metal and smoke.

“Do you work for him?” I asked, as we reached the sign where someone had corrected a spelling mistake with permanent marker and then someone else had added an unnecessary apostrophe because such is civilization.

Elna laughed, and the laugh had glass in its edges. “No. He doesn’t hire people like me. He collects people like me if he wants, and otherwise he points and flames. You’ll hear him before you see him. If you see him he has chosen you.”

“I don’t plan to see him,” I said, but I saw him then as he has been drawn in our circles, by men who forget what restraint is once a quill touches skin: tall and unbent, with the look that comes from a thousand eyes on your back, with hair like the underside of a rooks’ wing and teeth that are not unusual, and a castle behind him of green and soot and glass. It is a castle that stands where castles do not stand: in a place that smells of loam and wet bread and the wind through apple trees. I saw his green. Not the green of growth, which is hungry and warm. The green of velvet that has not been sat on, the green of expensive books you cannot touch, the green of envy, an old coin.

“You’ve met him and you lived,” I said. It came out in wonder. I was a little ashamed of that.

Elna touched the alder trunk with a reluctant palm. “For a value of lived. For a value of met. He visits in drafts. He leans in from wherever he is and blows. Somewhere there are trees grown to his height, food that never degrades, a bed with sheets like the backs of swans. He collects life and stacks it so it looks like a mercy. Do you know what men like him hate? Hunger. Not their own. The idea of it. His castle is fed.”

“The lush,” I said, and thought of water sliding down the inside of a jug.

She looked at me once, sharply. “You are afraid of water.”

“Not afraid. I’m—” I stopped, because I will not sip from a lie long enough to forget the taste. “Yes,” I said. “Worse than afraid.”

“We have never bred for the right fears,” Elna said. “We think a worlock should be free of the things that bite the rest, but then we make ourselves into something else, and we fall in love with stupid risks, and the wrong fear is the one that keeps us from dying the clever way. Be grateful, Pell. It will keep you from the river a little while longer.”

We reached the cafe near the car park where the rain never ends because there is always someone coming out and shaking their coat. Inside smelled of burned milk and new bread. Elna ordered black and I ordered something that would pretend to warm me. We stood under the heater and the man behind the counter leaned on the till and asked, “Busy out?” in the tone people use when they suspect you of being the sort of busy they cannot hold in their hands.

“Frogs on the road,” Elna said, and the man nodded, satisfied.

“Why tell me?” I said, around the edge of my cup, to Elna. “Why warn me of someone I will avoid until the bones of me are gone?”

She stirred her coffee with the end of a packet of sugar and did not open it. “Because your aunt has traded favors with three different lines for you. Because you are what you are and you look like the sort of quiet someone like him sees as a challenge. Because I dreamed you on a yellow morning with a dog at your heel and a house burning behind you, and I’ve learned to respect the unkindness of certain dreams.” She said it like the weather; this is happening, whether you would prefer it or not.

“I don’t have a dog,” I said.

“You will,” she said, and touched her throat with two fingers, absent, thoughtful. “I have to go. I have—” She stopped and for the first time looked not like a controlled storm but like a person. She touched her pocket with a thumb. “He’s in there. Sometimes. He speaks through things. Today he found the boiler.”

“The boiler,” I repeated.

“At the place I’m staying,” she said. “It’s an old starved villa near the underpass with windows like blinking. He spoke through the boiler in the night; I woke up and the pipes were a throat. The radiator teeth chattered. His voice was so amused. He said, Hello, mouse. He said, Are you ready to come to the green?”

“Are you,” I asked, sick with the right sort of curiosity, “a mouse?”

“Not the way he means,” she said, and put her empty cup down. “Don’t go without calling me. You won’t, but I’m saying it so that later I can think I saved you the same way I’ve failed to save all the others.”

“Elna,” I said, “if there’s something that can be done—”

“There’s always something that can be done. That’s the trick. Choose wrong and it will look the same as choosing right for seven minutes, sometimes longer.” She brushed her hands and the coffee smell sighed up from her sleeves. “Watch your phone.”

I nodded. She left. The barista looked at me and I looked at the sleeve of my coat and noted a bedraggled feather stuck to the fabric. It moved when I breathed. I plucked it out and put it in my pocket. From outside, the rain finally changed its mind and became drizzle, which to Basingstoke is the same thing only with more local pride.

I would have gone home and wrapped myself in absolute silence if the screen of my phone had not turned a deliberate black and then a slow, unpleasant green, as if touched by algae. The word hello wrote itself across it in lower-case letters as if it were an intimate. It wasn’t, but it pretended. The font had that expensive, quiet look.

My throat obeyed the old hook again. I set my cup down carefully. The barista said, “New app?” and I said, “Yes.”

hello, wrote the phone, and then, o.

“O,” I said, before I could shut my mouth, and then, “Not today.”

o rr in, wrote the phone. i would like to borrow your mouth.

“You cannot,” I said, and then remembered the man behind the till and added, “I’m practicing for a play.” He said, “Good on you,” which was not a thing men like him usually said to men like me but it was the sort of day when everything pressed its face to the glass.

i am very good at this, wrote the phone.

“Go away,” I said. “Go and harvest frogs.” I have a bad habit of making jokes when something wants to eat me. It’s a talent and it’s going to get me into a coffin.

i could be, wrote the phone, a friend. i could be the man who keeps the rain from the throat of your mother when she forgets her umbrella. i could be the man who promises there will never be another little boy held under, mouth stuffed with brown, heart unhooked. i could be the man who takes you by the hand, o rr in, and says: here is the green. it does not bite. it does not drown. it drinks.

“Crowl,” I breathed, because nobody else would grade me for the error of saying the name.

a cilice is for the obedient, wrote the phone, prettily. i do not require obedience from men like you. i require only acknowledgment. i am near. i am nearer. you will come to me when you are ready because we are the same shape in the shadow. be grateful, boy. your life is about to be excellent.

The screen went still. The green faded back to black, then to my own face in the reflection, rulined by a frown like a bruise. The barista said, under his breath, “We don’t get much theatre in here, to be honest.”

I made a shape in the air with my fingers that tasted like tin. It is a small thing, this shape; one of the first we are taught. Keep a lock on your breath. It closed my lungs just enough to make me feel like I was holding myself from falling.

At the doorway, as I went out, Aunt Bet texted: come back. there’s a woman here with a boat ticket and a very bad idea.

I typed, not me not me not me. Then: on my way.

— — —

My flat exists above a charity shop that prioritizes bagged costume jewelry and lamps with histories. You climb two flights and find yourself in a room that seems to be nothing but watches. I have pulled a string across the ceiling and threaded it with onion skins to keep moths from the curtains; I live as if I did not live long enough to bother. But the loophole of comfort: the kettle, the chair. Of course there are books. We are not saints of the word; we are bugs who like to eat pages.

I was not home long enough to admire the damp creeping in the left-hand corner before the bell downstairs clanged. Aunt Bet does not use the bell if she can help it; she sends thought, she yells, she waggles a broom up the stairs. This clang was the insistent hand of someone who thinks time is a table they have set.

I went down and a woman stood on the shop’s brown carpet, shaking her umbrella into a bucket with the sort of vigor that would upset a smaller god. Her hair was cut blunt at her jaw and her mouth was a line she had nursed for years. She held out the ticket like a talisman.

“I need to cross,” she said.

“No boats here,” Aunt Bet said from behind the counter. “What you need is a–”

“Crossing,” the woman said, and the word sat in the room like a full stop. “I’ve heard you’re a crossroads place. I brought you payment.” She shook the ticket. It was from the ferry to the Isle of Wight, dated two days from now.

“We’re not a crossroads,” Bet said, “we are a haberdashery with dreams. Also mine. We sell dreams if they can be worn as a hat.”

“I need my son,” the woman said, and looked at me in a way that made me examine my hands. “You’re the finder.”

I glanced at Bet. “I am,” I said, which was a small theft from myself. “Tell me your son’s name.”

“Daniel,” she said. Her mouth loosened. And then, sheepish, “Dan.”

“Yes,” I said softly. “I was at the field this morning.”

“Then why isn’t he behind you?” she asked, and then put a hand over her mouth, with the slow horror of someone who has just slapped a stranger in a church. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’ve not slept. I would sell the bed he sleeps in, I would sell everything and anything. He liked boats. He did not like water. You know children. He would stand in the garden in the rain and he’d say, Mum, the sky’s spitting on me, and I’d laugh. Why did I laugh?”

“It’s a good line,” I said, and the anger she was carrying turned half a degree and did not point at me anymore.

“She says she’s going to the island,” Bet put in. “As if you and I can forbid it.”

“I have a room in Shanklin,” the woman said. “My sister keeps it for me. He’ll go to the beach, he’ll go where it is easy, he’ll walk along the cliffs on those silly little legs that go too fast and then he’ll be gone. Do you know what it is to see your own boy as a blur and not be able to call him back?”

“Every day,” I said. I am not a father. I remembered instead being a son, that blur of me that my mother chased with bread or scolding, and I felt suddenly cut open by how much she’d run.

“What’s your name?” Bet asked the woman.

“Kara,” she said. “With a K. My husband would be here but he is very busy pretending it’ll all be fine. He was always better at that bit.”

“We don’t deal in boats,” Bet said again as if the repetition would make the river recoil.

“You deal in other things,” Kara said. “You wear the word ‘worlock’ in your bones. You look at me and you see the lines that run from me to the boy to the thing that took him, and you think, If I tug it will drag me skin-first through a hedge. I cannot take your fear away from you. But you can take mine away in pieces. Fifty pounds per piece.”

She took an envelope from inside her coat. It was thick, not with money but with the sense of money: the smell of it, the memory of it in the paper. People rarely bring me cash in envelopes. They bring me jam sometimes. They bring me family recipes, a pair of earrings, photographs, words in bundles. I work for these. I am not poor the way I might be. I do not know what to do with an envelope fat with notes except take it and feel vulgar.

“We’ll do this,” I said, looking at the line Bet’s mouth had become. “Now. Not with boats. With rules.”

Kara pressed her hands together. “Tell me.”

“You don’t go to the island,” I said. “If he pulls you anywhere, you go the opposite way. If your phone goes green, you turn it off. If the boiler in your house starts talking, throw a sheet over it and go outside to laugh very loudly. You do not say his name. You do not give any water in your house the right to speak. You drink from a bottle.” I took a pen and wrote on the back of the ferry ticket. “You draw this on the inside of your front door with your left hand and you do it twice for luck. You put this salt in a bowl by the sink. You leave your shoes on the mat and you speak to them when you put them back on.”

“What do I say to my shoes?” Kara asked, with an exhaustion that made her voice velvet.

“Say, Thank you for bringing me home,” I said. “It matters.” I looked up, away from the comfort of instructions. “I will go back to the field. I will go at dusk. I will not let him be unloved there.”

Kara cried as if her face had been forced to learn the shape. She clutched the envelope as if it were a baby and then put it, blushing, on the counter and pushed it towards Bet with two fingers. “Fifty,” she said. “Per piece.”

“Three pieces,” Bet said briskly, because she has the heart of an anchor in a rag-and-bone ship. “We will not run you dry.”

Kara nodded and wiped her nose and the ticket with her thumb and said, “He loved trains. I am saying this so you know he will come home to us and then run away from home to be at the station. He would have done that anyway. If I can get him home I will let him do anything he wants.” She looked at me, ferocious. “I will chain him to the couch. Say it into your magic so it knows I meant it.”

“I’ll put it in,” I said, and scribbled on the back of the ticket again: let him run and let him be caught.

“Go,” Bet said to me, low. “Bring Elna if you can. She looked dangerous enough to be useful.”

“I’m not collecting knives,” I said. But my pocket buzzed and the message glowed from a number I had not given my hands permission to recognize: tonight.

It was signed: E.

— — —

At dusk, the willows were all arms and the river tried to look tired. I brought my circle and a jar with a paper label that said HONEY and held something else, a thick, clear, viscous thing that is made when you take the wet and tell it not to be wet. It’s a charlatan, a performance. It takes practice. The jar felt heavy and smug.

Elna came out of the shadow like she had been built there. “He’s excited,” she said, not greeting and who would need to? Her hair had been tied back with a red cord. It looked like a pulse.

“I brought rules,” I said. “For the mother. She is brave enough.”

“She is exactly brave enough,” Elna agreed. “The way soft animals are brave when the fox enters the field.”

“Tell me you brought something to chew on when we are scared,” I said. “I forgot.”

She handed me a packet of peanuts like a benediction. We stood and the path made its half-moon and the kingfishers refused to be seen. There are also deer in those fields sometimes and once, a year ago, a fox stood in the open and showed me his ribcage. He didn’t run. He didn’t need to.

“I’m going to put this near the bend,” I said, holding up the jar.

“Don’t slip,” she said.

“I have boots,” I said, which is a sentence that should be placed on my headstone if I ever have one: He had boots. “Talk to me.”

“About what?”

“Anything that requires me to be more interested in it than the river.”

She slid a look at me, and then said, “Do you know how my grandmother used to make cider? She would threaten the apples. She would stand under the tree and she would say, I will not eat you if you are sour. I will grind you and you will be sauce. And then she would whisper to them when they fell—not loud, mind, we are not savages—she would whisper, Thank you. The cider took the fear. It was never sour.”

“Your grandmother was a worlock,” I said, crouching and tilting the jar. The river made its sound in my teeth. I poured a line of clear onto the mud just shy of the water and then drew it across with a bone spoon. The stuff is sticky; it holds. The smell of it is like a thunderstorm trapped in a cupboard and told not to come out.

“My grandmother was an expert in making bargains with things that could not read. It is the same magic, done sideways,” Elna said. “She would have liked you if you had arrived with a pie. You did not.”

“I am trying to tell a river to keep its voice down,” I said, hearing the tremor again.

“I know,” she said, and very lightly put her hand to the back of my neck, firm and human. “You are embarrassing it with your jar, in case you were wondering.”

“I am content to do so,” I said. “I was told to humiliate the wet in front of its friends early in the term.”

The jar’s line grew under my fingers, made a quiet that the river could not swallow. For a moment the sound around us changed and the air was dry in a way that made my tongue curious. We had made a small room between the bank and the water where a boy might stand and a name might be said without being sucked from his mouth.

“Dan,” I said, and the name sat down. “Dan. We’re here in the name of the person you loved best and the person you loved second and all the people who gave you biscuits when you weren’t supposed to have them. We’re here to say: Come sideways, not through. Come to the edge of the word you went past. Come to this little dry. You are allowed to be found.”

The willows did a little gossip. The reeds did a little threat. The river made itself heavy, like a body in a bed that refuses to crack its spine and get up. The world scrolled. Something tugged again, hard, at my heel, and if not for Elna’s hand at my neck—ridiculous, how much a human hand weighs against a river—I might have stumbled.

“Show-off,” she murmured, and I didn’t know if she meant me or the Loddon.

There was a shape to my left where there had not been a shape. It stood in the little dry between the jar-line and the rushes. He was small because he was small. He had the bones of his face the way boys do just before they change into somebody else. He looked at my jar like he was going to poke a finger in it and then he looked at my face, briskly.

“Mum?” he said.

“Coming,” I said, and it was a relief that made all my old fears moor somewhere quiet for a second, a breath. “Do you fancy peanuts? It’s a very adult snack.”

“Yes,” the boy said gravely. “I do.”

Elna made a sound like a chord. “Tell him to stand,” she said. “Tell him to think about dryness.”

“Stand, Dan,” I said. “Think about the driest thing. Think about toast. Think about a towel in the sun. Think about the chalk in a classroom nobody goes to in August.”

He wrinkled his nose. “Boring.”

“Yes,” I said. “You love it.”

He looked at his feet, and then lifted his left foot, made a show of placing it down just inside the line, put all his weight there, took a breath, moved the other. He crossed, which is a trick that looks like walking but is a bargain with the earth.

When he was in the grass, Elna put the peanuts in his hand, which is how it should always be when you return a child: something sweet and salt and for now. I felt the river make a short, furious intake of breath and then I heard the voice of the man I had been asked to fear. He spoke from the reeds like a child who cannot bear to lose alone.

oh, he said. how charming.

I set my jaw. It clicked in a way the dentist would disapprove of. “Take your snack and run,” I said to Dan. “Run in exactly the direction you most want to go. Then turn left. Then stop.”

He nodded. He had a face that would be a heart-breaker if he was given the chance to live to heartbreaks. He ran. He ran as if a fox chased him and his feet knew the map and the grass liked him.

Elna held up her hand and the river stopped. It tried, at least, to climb her wrist. Her thumb and forefinger pressed as if on invisible skin. She isn’t stronger than he is; none of us are, I suspect. She is clever in the moment moments arrive. She uses the seconds like knives.

“Don’t,” she said, and the reeds obliged her by stiffening like offended men. We walked back along the path very fast and in no way like running, because we would not give the river the show. Behind us, the wet stepped forward and then back and then forward again. Aurelian Crowl laughed the way people laugh when you have, briefly, been amusing. He had found us and he let us go, because power arranges the luxury of savoring.

“He saw you,” Elna said, once the car park was in sight and the bins were sitting with their lids up like yawns. “He will not forget the way your voice sounds.”

“I do not like being hunted,” I said, because understatement is English and I can’t be bothered to be anything else.

“We hunt,” she said, reminding me, gently. “It’s what we are.”

“We hunt our own,” I said. “No. We hunt what our own hunts.”

“We can argue doctrine another day,” Elna said, with the air of someone who will tell me everything and nothing and can be won with a single right sentence. “I am going to sleep now, if he lets me.”

“You think he will,” I said.

“He’s busy,” she said, and tilted her head to the sky where a low, thick cloud had the shape of a dome, of a ceiling, of a hand. “He’s building something. He thinks he’s the only one who knows he’s building it, but at least three women in town have felt it in their old hips and three men have written it on the back of their betting slips and thrown them away. He is gathering his green.”

I thought of Kara and her envelope and the ticket with my little lines on it and the baby man who had already wanted to be older and faster and gone. I thought of Aunt Bet’s pin in the thistles jar. I thought of a castle that is not on any map, whose walls are fed by what it takes. In my little flat the onion skins would be restless. I would not sleep, but men like me lie in their beds and practice considering the shape of sleep until it deigns to come by and be seen at the door.

“Elna,” I said, and she paused. “Thank you.”

“You’ll have to pay me,” she said. “With something you don’t mind missing.”

I nodded, because I have something, everyone does, and because I have not yet decided what it is.

As I climbed my stairs, my phone hummed again. The screen lit not with words but with a little window on a world that had the feel of elsewhere. There were curtains in the frame, heavy and green, and the floor beyond them was layered in rugs, and the air had the stillness of places where men are served. A man passed in front of the lens—no, not a man, something shaped like one, wearing a robe that thought highly of itself. He paused and turned, just enough that I saw the line of his jaw and the pale of his eye. He lifted a hand and some invisible servant brought him a glass. He toasted me, this was for me, he toasted me from the place where he lives and we do not.

i will send for you, wrote Aurelian Crowl, across the picture, as if it were a shag carpet he could write in with his finger. not today. you were brave today. i would like that not to go to waste.

He let me watch him drink. He let me see him set the glass down on a table that had once been a tree that had once been a forest. Behind him, the window was not a window at all but a wall of leaves, lit softly from within, as if every leaf were a pocket holding a living light and he was stealing it, gently and forever. The rain had stopped. Down on the ring road the cars hissed with old water. I locked my door and leaned my head back against it like a man listening for the sea.

“There’s nowhere to ferry,” I said to the empty room. “Not really.”

The window on the phone went black. My reflection blinked back at me, a little wavery, like I was a man seen through water. I went to the kettle and boiled it, and when the steam rose, I stepped aside. I didn’t let it touch my face. I am not reckless. Not exactly. Not yet. I have boots. I have jars. I have a woman who will hand me peanuts and tell me the right lies. I have a boy who might be sleeping now with his shoes by the door.

Above the kettle an onion skin trembled. There are omens everywhere, if you like to be toyed with by your own eyes. I made the kind of tea that cannot hurt you and I drank it and it hurt, which is not the tea’s fault. Downstairs, the shop’s door bell chimed for no one. The salt I had spilled in my pocket left a pale, sea-crusted crescent on the wood desk by the window. I decided to leave it there. In the morning I would pretend to be a man with no yearning, who wanted only what was near. In the night, in Basingstoke, the wet didn’t sleep.

In the night, Aurelian Crowl lay on a bed so soft I could feel it in my spine through the glass of the phone I had turned face down under a book. There was a wind where he was because there is always a wind where things grow. It carried someone’s laughter. He smiled with half his mouth, like a man with a knife in it. He said, because he could, “Soon,” and somewhere, not far enough, three taps like a spoon on a saucer echoed from inside the pipes. I curled on my side and pulled the duvet up like a barricade and swallowed hard and thought of chalk. In my dream I walked on dry land. It mocked me. It moved. I ran. I ran and did not sink, not yet, and behind me a castle whose walls were leaves rose and rose and rose.Morning made a brittle sound in the pipes as if the building had been drinking in its sleep and now regretted it, and for a heartbeat I thought it was him, helloing through the copper. It wasn’t; it was the ordinary misery of an old flat that asks to be forgiven each time you ask it for hot water. I boiled the kettle anyway and watched the steam rope itself toward the ceiling where the onion skins trembled like a line of saints too thin to keep their haloes. Aunt Bet knocked with her knuckles in a rhythm that said I am trying not to worry; I let her in, and she took in the cup, the salt crescent on the desk, the phone facedown on a book about fungi I had meant to give back to the library a month ago, and she said, “Do you want toast?” which in our language meant, Tell me if the green got into your lungs, tell me if your hands are steady, tell me if you think you’re clever or lucky or already dead. I said, “Yes,” because we do not make speeches to the person who will give you bread and stand between you and a gust.

Kara texted me two words at almost the same time as Bet buttered, The first: here. The second: breathing. She did not add exclamation marks; she was a woman who kept punctuation for bills and notices. I didn’t breathe until the picture came through, a crooked image of a boy under a blanket on a couch I did not know, face turned toward a television that showed a cartoon fox caught in a perpetual stew of cats’ eyes and a saucepan. His feet were dirty in the way that says I have touched the real outside world and come back regardless. His wrist was bare; the plaited thread had come off in my pocket the night before and now sat on my desk like a small caught snake that had decided to be a bracelet. I sent a dot in reply because I do not say congratulations to a mother whose boy has come home wet and sharp with fear; I say, I have more work and it is already under the doors.

“We’ll take her money,” Bet said, mouth full, which means she was on my side and against me in the way only family can be. “But we will not spend it. We will put it in the jar labeled A RAIN FOR ANOTHER DAY and we will wait to know what it was for.” She spread marmalade like a glossy deceit and then stopped, looking at my face, entirely unmagical, entirely aunt. “He looked you through a window?”

“He toasted me,” I said, and made a sound like I was laughing because otherwise I might have spat. “With something pressed from a fruit he coerces. He wrote on the picture as if it were carpet. He told me I was brave.”

“Oh dear,” she said, quietly. “He would enjoy you. He would enjoy you the way a person enjoys a complicated board game on a Sunday, when there is nowhere else to be.” She reached out and pinched my sleeve and I didn’t flinch the way I sometimes do because I knew the pinching wasn’t a spell, it was an old habit from when I was fourteen and slipping like a cup from hands. “You don’t go alone to things which echo,” she added, as if she were telling me not to forget a scarf.

“I won’t,” I lied, and immediately hated the taste of it. “Elna will go in front. She likes the part of the dance where the floor is already moving. She told me he’s building. The old women feel it in their hips, the men on losing streaks write it on slips of paper and throw it away for the pigeons to read.”

“We will feel it when the jars won’t seal,” Bet said, eyes going to the shelf where THISTLES sat between COCKLE and SEAM. “We will know it when somebody we didn’t invite begins to hum in the refrigerator and the milk sours in hours. The last time I felt a big build I was in bed with your Uncle Dol, and the spring bed sang the middle part of a hymn for three nights. I thought it was romance. It was just a mill being raised without permission two towns over. We went and leaned pepper at it until it went quiet.”

I asked her to hand me the bracelet and the envelope Kara had pushed over the counter, and we settled the question of money the way you settle a cat, by making a place that looked like it wanted it and then not moving when it tried to leave. I wrote a receipt that said, For returning a boy to a mother, paid in fears. I have a file of such things, little lies with my signature that might be needed when my own fears grow teeth and come looking for transactions to nibble. At the bottom of the page I wrote a second line in a language that tastes like old coins and cloves, Elna’s payment clamoring behind my ears like a kettle: Orrin Pell owes. Owing is a string; sometimes it keeps you on the bank.

Kara insisted on me coming to hers to return the bracelet, which was not necessary, and completely necessary, and I went because it meant I would see whether the green had put its thumb on their taps. It was a terrace on the north side, a warren of halls that smelled of bleach and biscuits, a hallway where three coats hung like two living people and a coat shaped like the ghost of a larger you. Dan opened the door to me before Kara could, which is usually wrong, and he stood very straight because he saw me as a person who had returned him to himself and a person to be measured. “You came,” he said, and in that voice was a thing I recognized and wish I didn’t: a boy who has touched a wolf and now walks carefully around all dogs.

“I come when I can be useful,” I said, and he looked at me sideways, amused as only nine can be. The couch had been conquered by his blanket and the television’s fox had fled, a weatherman now describing rain as if it were an inheritance you didn’t know you had. I saw, in the corner by the skirting board, a words-worth of water gathering itself where the plaster had flaked, not quite a leak, more a suggestion. Crowl has a way of pointing at a corner of your life and saying, There, that texture, let us encourage it.

Kara made tea she did not drink. She put a bowl of cereal in front of Dan and he ignored it in favor of a packet of crisps and I did not tell her to say anything; when a body comes back from the water you give it salt like a map and sugar like forgiveness. “He says a man sang him to the river,” she said, matter-of-factly, because she had slept and crying had rearranged her into a person who could speak and listen simultaneously. “Not a song that rhymes. The kind of song that is a counting that never ends. He says it tasted like mint on the first bit and then like old pennies on the second and then like nothing at all. He says—” and here she faltered and put her palm flat on the counter like she was checking if it still existed, “he says when he closed his eyes he saw a room full of leaves and a man who was not in the room but everywhere else in the world.”

“I saw the room,” I said. I pushed the bracelet across the table. It had dried and taken on a brown-green. “He writes in leaves the way you and I write in ink. He builds his words like hedges in winter. Did Dan hear the name for him in the counting?”

Kara and Dan both shook their heads, the sort of choreography that happens when you live in the same house long enough to share a set of muscles. “He didn’t use his name,” Dan said around crisp, crumbs sticking to the corner of his mouth like confetti from a party he did not attend. “He called me little boatman and little mackerel and once he called me little frog and then he laughed about it.” He frowned at the bracelet and was very brave. “He said if I knew how much of me was water I wouldn’t pretend to be dry. He said everything gets thirsty in the end. He said—” Here his throat did a reluctant bounce, the sort boys don’t let you see, “he said I could go to the green and never be told to brush my teeth again.”

“Brushing your teeth is one of the few magics we allow to be boring,” I said, because there are times you say the least useful, truest thing and watch the body in front of you seize it like a branch. I did not say, We will teach you how to stand where the wet speaks without listening, because he was nine and his mother had a line through her chest, invisible and heavy. I asked to use the bathroom and Kara nodded like she was handing me a shovel for a grave; in houses like this the pipes are the spine and if you touch them wrong your hands come back with someone else’s fingerprints on them.

I tied the bracelet to the tap, thoughtfully, a joke the pipe did not appreciate. I spoke to the drains not as if they were persons but as if they were old horses in winter, and I poured a smear from my second jar, thinner than last night’s, along the inside lip of the sink where the wet licks. The smell rose up like a modest ghost and rested its hand on my shoulder like a relative. The mirror watched me do something I should not be able to do in property that has a mortgage and water rates. In the corner of the mirror my face was a man who would throw himself in front of a tap if it started coughing a name. I cut a hair-thin thread of green from the space just above the plughole, where it was clinging like a cobweb in a house that doesn’t admit to spiders. It came away slow and sly and stuck to the bone of my thumb like it had opinions; I burned it on the hot part of the kettle and it made a noise like air being slapped. The kettle did not know what it had done, which is true of many kettles and men faced with use.

I went back into the kitchen and told Dan to let me see his wrists. He held them out obediently, and because he is what he is and we are what we are, there was a rime of not-water on his left wrist, invisible if you didn’t pay for certain spectacles with a year of your luck. I blew on it and it ran away in the shape of a small, offended fish. “He left you a gate,” I said to the boy while Kara looked in alarm at nothing at all that she could see. “He will not be allowed to use it. I have put a stopper in the pipe. It won’t come out unless you pull on it from both sides. Don’t pull on it. If something in the house speaks and you think it is him, make an ugly face with your mouth and stick your tongue out and say, ‘My name is my mother’s name cut in half and stuck back together by a schoolboy with glue.’ Don’t worry if the grammar is wrong. The wet doesn’t mark papers.”

Dan practiced the face, which was miraculous in its unintended rudeness, and then practiced a second time, more miraculous. Kara put her hand to her mouth again and looked simultaneously appalled and very briefly saved; in some houses the first ugly face a child is taught is entirely practical. I left them with a packet of salt and a bad drawing of a window that isn’t a window, taped on the inside of their kitchen door. On the way out I touched the shoes on the mat and said, Thank you for bringing him home, and I felt old for the first time that day, old in the way of someone who has to tell doors to behave.

On the pavement the rain had dressed down to a sulk and the ring road down the hill made a noise like a man mumbling to himself with a sandwich in his mouth. I took a route that avoided seeing the lake and failed without meaning to; the town’s layout does that to you. Eastrop Park sits like a coin in a palm, the paths lifting toward it without asking anyone’s opinion. The lake has drawn its share of grief and geese, and in summer the family boats go out like little teeth. Today the boats were empty and moored, each hull collecting a thin layer of green. Somebody had given the swans bread shaped like hope and the swans were doing their outrageous best to be cruel about it. I stopped because the fountain in the middle, a sham pillar that coughs water out of its fake mouth, made a new sound. Before, it had only ever been a throat. Now it was practicing vowels.

A small boy with a red coat and a father in a bright jacket were making a ritual of chucking crusts and not looking at one another. The water around the fountain had an oil-slick sheen the color of expensive tea, and every now and then it flashed a sort of velvet at me, which I am fool enough to recognize. I leaned on the rail, ostensibly to look like a man who cannot resist damp masonry, and hummed under my breath an old pub song my grandmother used to hum when she poured vinegar on a burn, an ugly song about a girl who fell in love with a horse and lost a shoe, that to this day I cannot sing around decent people. The fountain faltered in its vowels and went back to coughing like before, as if embarrassed to have been heard, and a pigeon on the rail next to me laughed in the rusty way pigeons do when they approve of magic done by someone else.

The father glanced over his shoulder and said, “They’ll bite,” and I said, “They don’t have teeth,” and he said, “You haven’t met our one; he’s got a set he borrowed from a dentist.” We smiled at each other in the way two men who are responsible for very different things will smile at a common public space, and I moved on because I do not take boys in red coats from their fathers unless the river is already calling them by pet names.

Under the underpass the town keeps its second weather. It smells like coins and ghosts in trainers, and the walls bloom in winter with paint that says FURY and LUKE and sometimes a phone number for a woman named D who will change your life for twenty and a walk. It is beautiful in its cruelty, and it is the sort of place that makes men like Crowl lick a finger and hold it up and say, Here. Elna’s borrowed villa had the sort of name that a softened real estate agent would give: The Oaks, The Cedars, a hedge where all the trees have already gone to cupboards. It sat behind a grille like teeth, and the windows blinked in a tired way in the thin afternoon, and when I put my hand on the door it knew me as Not Him and opened with the slow humiliation of a lock that would much rather be paying attention to someone important.

“You’re late to my fear,” Elna called from the kitchen, and when I stepped into the narrow corridor I saw the walls were sweating. Not in a human way; in that way an atmosphere can decide it is bigger than a room. She stood at the sink with the cupboard doors open beneath it and the trap exposed and the pipes making a sound that you should only ever hear in a throat when it is making a plea. She had a loop of copper wire between her teeth. “If you’ve brought anything that pretends to be dry,” she added conversationally, “now would be a good time to give me it and go into the garden and look at somebody’s miraculous astroturf for five minutes.”

I went to the sink because there is a part of me that has been engineered to disobey instructions that are meant to save me, and I put my jar next to the soap. “He thinks this house is his mouth,” I said, which was accurate and not useful, and she hissed around the wire and spat it out into her hand like a coin. “No, he thinks my sleep is his mouth,” she said, and punched the wire through itself with her thumb as if making a tiny crown. “He dreamed me last night using the boiler as his ear because he doesn’t understand that a woman can sleep without offering him a story.”

There are women who I would not touch in the middle of a working, not with a hand, not with a thought. I touched Elna and the room steadied, not because my touch is worth more than hers but because sometimes a body next to your body returns you to what bodies can do. She was cold along the wrist; she did not notice I was holding her until a noise deep in the pipe dropped two octaves and tried to imitate a voice. Crowl has a voice you would laugh at over drinks at a wedding because it is a cliché of power, and I am frightened of it and will call it names anyway. He spoke a syllable like a ring dropped in water, and then he told Elna to hiss. She did not. She exhaled in a way I recognized, the exhale that says, I have waited tables and told men to look with their eyes and not their fingers, and nothing in me is going to squeeze for you.

“This will pinch,” she warned, and slid the copper crown around the pipe’s throat. When it pinched, the house shook, and if you have not been in a place that has shaken with a name rather than a motion, you have not been inside a body when it chooses not to die. She leaned her forehead against the cupboard door like a penitent for two breaths and then straightened. “I will have a cup of something heavy, please,” she said, “heavy with the smell of forever,” and I made tea the way I do when I know exactly how a person takes it and can pretend I do not care if I am wrong. We stood in the kitchen with the pipes and the cheap cupboards and the laminate pretending to be wood. The shape of the room altered. It became hospitable again by degrees, the way a dog will come and put its chin on your knee after it has made you believe it could bite your throat.

“I owe you,” I said, handing her the mug, and the debt sat in my red mouth and looked attractive. “You asked me for something I didn’t mind missing. I have something. Two somethings, if you will take the first and leave the second for when I have made you a meal that breaks your back with comfort.”

She took the tea and didn’t drink, just held it between her palms in that way of hers which says I am the sort of person who believes in reheating. “Say them both,” she said, and she was tired and the tired was the sort of tired I respect: not self-pity, but the sort that knows exactly where your body ends and is bored of being forced to go on anyway.

“The first is a rhyme for stepping over little waters,” I said. “It is not a powerful rhyme. It is not ancient. I made it when I was twelve and a teacher told me off for being late and I wanted to walk over the gutter that had been a river to me for stiff ten minutes. I say it in my head and my feet do not feel the pull. It goes like a counting trick and it ends on a word that is the name of a sandwich. If I give it to you, it will become yours. My mouth will not know the path of it anymore. My feet will have to find a new way or wait.”

“I will take that,” she said, and did not pretend not to be thrilled. “I will take it because it will help me cross the small. I am arrogant about the big things and they do not always punish me. The small ones hate my arrogance. Possibly because they are small.”

“The second is—” and here I looked at the ceiling because the words were not smooth, they were bricked, “a thing I say between the numbers, the bit of language my grandmother gave me on a bus when she was knitting and the bus went over a bridge she hadn’t prepared for. It binds the numbers together so that they can be eaten by the next number. I have said it since, and it keeps my lungs from inventing alarms. If I gave you that, I would become worse. I would give him a mapping of my breath in the minutes I am crossing a footbridge with teenagers laughing ahead of me and I am trying not to run. So you cannot have that. But I am telling you it exists, so that when I give you the first thing you will know you are not taking the only rope out of my hands.”

She drank half the cup in one swallow and set it down like an argument concluded. “Give me the sandwich rhyme,” she said, and I did, speaking it in my mouth like I was tasting a dumb sweet from a tuck shop the school never should have allowed to open. The words left me with that exact cheap sugar ache. My feet felt immediate, bare and ambitious, and I was mildly delighted to be annoyed by them. “Oh, that is ugly,” Elna said, pleased. “That is exactly ugly enough to be useful. It goes nowhere and takes you with. Thank you.” She picked up her mug again and did a little dance you would not have noticed if you weren’t watching the way I was; it was the dance of a person crossing the smallest stream and refusing to be seen doing it.

The dog came later, after she'd slept under the crown and woken with her hair in new arguments. I had gone outside to look at the square of grass that belonged to no one and everyone, the patch that the council had once given a name to, a name with Park in it, and then changed its mind. It had a bench that had been dedicated to a man named Ted who liked to sit at 3 p.m. and pretend to be unimpressed by schoolchildren. Under the bench there was a heap of old leaf matter and a mouth that breathed. When I sat down, the mouth shuffled and became a dog, medium in every way except eyes. His ears were not matched, and one of them looked like it had been the subject of a conversation with something that had teeth and too little to say. He considered me with the intensity of a person deciding whether to take a job that would require weekends.

“You’ll be mine later,” I told him, because Elna has her dreams and I have had my share of mornings that begin with a sentence arriving like a telegram. He put his chin on my boot and exhaled in a way that said, Yes, but you will be mine, which is the correct order of things for dogs and men who know their limits. I scratched the place behind his odd ear and he looked at me like I was a poor student learning a trick slowly and he would be paid regardless. “You have a name you won’t tell me,” I said, and he blinked, which means, yes, I have a name, but it is not the one the woman shouted from the back step. “You can tell me later,” I said. “You can tell me when the rain is behaving and the pipes are not full of men.”

At the end of the afternoon the town put on its orange coat and the ring road again became a belt being tightened; people wanted their dinners, they wanted their screens, they wanted to lie down without thinking of rivers. I went back to the shop to give Aunt Bet the receipt and to sit in the corner under the shelf that holds the old jam jars we don’t put anything in because they remember. She was making a list on a brown paper bag because she had given all the good paper to children who come in and ask for two pages because they are making a zine and what is a zine and will you be in it if we make you a character. “Pure caraway, another spool of black the weight of an apple, that man from the Fair Mile wants a bark as sour as his face, he can have hawthorn if he promises to keep his lungs in,” she muttered, and when she looked up her eyes did the old cloudy slide toward my collarbone. “He is busy,” she said unnecessarily, and I nodded and told her that the fountain had been making a mouth on top of a mouth and that I had insulted it in time.

“We’ll need to put something in the park,” she said, and she was already opening a drawer that has no label because it refuses them. “Something glass they will think is about art. Something that makes the water feel as if it’s already fulfilled. A promise it can sleep beside and forget to keep. I have a bottle that my grandmother saved a lightning in and never let out.”

“You told me that bottle broke when you were fourteen and dared it into the garden,” I said, because part of my job is to remind her when she is asking the dead to do living work.

She sniffed. “I said ‘a bottle,’ not that bottle,” she said, which is the sort of lie old women tell because they know better ways of telling the truth are bad for business. “Go to the train bridge,” she added, as if the thought had lain down flat and been stepped on by another thought and so become practical. “The boy told his mother about a gnome who walks the lines, and the gnome does, some nights, but tonight I think the gnome will have a friend. You will go and stand under the bridge with a pocket of salt and the name of the gnome in your mouth, and you will ask him if he has been offered a job in a place where the pay is green.”

“I don’t know the gnome’s name,” I said, and she smiled like a knife. “You do,” she said. “We all do. We call him by his job. Try that and see who looks down.”

The Fairfields bridge has a hum that isn’t just trains. All bridges do, but this one remembers being built by men who sang without wanting to sing, and their songs got in the concrete. The underside smells like cigarettes and once, before it was painted over, somebody had drawn a woman with a swan’s neck and a man’s teeth and written under it in marker, MY EX. When I stepped into the space the evening poured itself down my back; it was cold and it had that clean edge it gets in November when the leaves are indecisive and the hedges are honest. I put my hand on the central pillar because there are times when you touch the big thing that holds things up and wait for it to touch you back.

“Linesman,” I said, and my voice sounded like a threat and a plea and a tired joke, all correctly, because I am all three. “Track-walker. Checker. Man with a lamp. Man with a bag. Long-legged person of the half-warm night. Come and speak to a worse light.”

He was there before the last word had left my lips, because it isn’t that hard to fetch a man whose name is an occupation and whose occupation is to never be late. He looked like every storybook drawing of a gnome the town had ever produced, which is to say nothing at all like a gnome and exactly like an old man with a back that had been promised an apology and never collected it. He wore hi-vis and a cap that had once been a better cap and boots that were his children and his enemies. His hands remembered a spanner when they were empty. He did not glow until he needed to. He looked down because that is what men like him do. “If you’re after the boy,” he said without preface, “he is home eating crisps and annoying a cartoon.

“I had the honor,” I said, trying not to be polite to a creature that likes to be asked to help and dislikes being told it has already done so. “If you’ve come to warn me off, you should know I’m not paid by wage.”

He leaned his hip against a bit of bridge that had been smoothed by a thousand legs in a thousand afternoons. “He offered me a different lamp,” the linesman said. “He sent a draft to lie along the tracks and it smelled like apples that have never had a bruise. He sent a woman’s voice to say the kind of thing that makes men think they’re not stupid at all. He offered me a bed against a wall that is all leaves, where no woman would ever turn her back and pretend to sleep because she is not ready to forgive. He told me I would not have to walk alone, because the gnomes would keep time together.” He used the old word himself, with fond insult, because that is how we survive names meant to make us smaller. He pulled a can from his pocket, opened it without asking if I wanted one, and drank. “I told him I cannot walk on a floor that is a lie. He told me he had a real floor, a floor made of forest. I told him, You’ve never fallen on one the way I have if you think that’s soft.”

“He will ask again,” I said, thinking of green velvet and cups lifted toward my mouth. “He’ll ask you for a small thing you can afford to give, and you will give it because he will make it look decent to give it. The second time he will ask for something you cannot afford. You will be too polite to point out the change in price.”

The linesman nodded as if I had quoted a training manual he had written. “He already asked for my whistle,” he said. “He said I would not need it where we were going, because we would not use such ugly warnings, because nothing about the moving parts would be surprised.” He took his whistle from his pocket and put it in my hand. It was dented and a bit resentful. “Keep that for me tonight,” he said. “If you hear a train when the time is wrong, blow it, and I will turn around and come back for whoever’s got their foot stuck in a thought.” He looked me up and down with that cataloging glance old men reserve for young men they do not quite approve of but love anyway. “He will try you next,” he said simply. “You’ve got a head that wants to go under an idea and the legs to carry you up to it. Don’t let him tell you you’re joining a union when really he wants the badge on your coat.”

“I am already in a union,” I said, feeling the whistle against my palm like a keystone. “We are the small union that meets under beds and in back rooms and in the heart of people who haven’t been paid for three months and can still afford to share a sandwich. It is the union of poor planning and good luck. We bring thermoses. We clap when a person is brave even if they are stupid.”

A train went over then, all metal and scream, and we looked at our feet like men look at their own foolishness when it is very loud. When it had gone, the linesman struck a match for no reason and then shook it out. “There is a culvert at Black Dam,” he said, without prelude. “There is a mouth in it. He is going to open that mouth. Not all the way. He is not that greedy in public. Just enough to let a boy as high as my spanner walk into it without bending. He will open it at eleven because he respects the clock on the wall, even if he spares none of us elsewise. Put your jar there. Put your salt there. Put your body there if you have to. Make the mouth forget it is a mouth.” He tapped his cap brim in the sort of courtesy that survived three wars and three more endings, and then he was gone because someone up the line had sent him a word, and that word had the shape of a front door.

I took myself to Black Dam after dark with a dog who had decided he loved me enough to supervise but not enough to be seen sitting when I said sit. He trotted ahead of me like a man with a full bladder. The water there is tamed in the way municipal water is tamed, which is to say given clothes and expected to eat with a fork and knife. It lies flat so people can reflect themselves and feel wise. The culvert lives at the edge like the part of the tablecloth you use to wipe a stain pretending nobody will notice. It has a metal grille that has saved more lives than there are names to write down in registers, and it has graffiti that says JAMIE LOVES JAMIE and then a date. The wind off it was wrong; it had that smell of pears in winter, the smell nobody likes because it is too much like a promise.

Elna met me there with a coil of red cord in her pocket and her hair tucked up under a hat that had once been a laugh and was now dignity. “He will pretend to be the other side of polite tonight,” she said, making marks in the air with her hands as if she were knitting with the dark. “He will say we have mistaken him for a villain. He will say he saves. He will say he offers continuity. He will say he treats hunger like a sin, not a condition. We will not believe him because we have had to be hungry in ways he cannot smell.”

“Do we have time to be clever?” I asked, and she looked at my jar and then at the grille and then at the dog, who was sniffing the bollard as if it were in love with him. “We have time to be ugly,” she said. “Clever takes patience; ugly takes force. Put your line down. Make a scab.”

We made a scab. I poured and the clear lay along the lip of the culvert and the smell made the hairs on my wrist remember thunderstorms and cousins. There was a moment when the mouth forgot how to be a mouth and became, instead, a notion. You can walk past a notion. You can put up a sign that says nothing in this direction and people will have the decency to believe it if they are not ordered to do otherwise by something with a title. The dog leaned into my thigh so hard it would have been an insult if it wasn’t grace. We whispered names of boys into the cold while the jar set, and the wind did that thing wind does when it wants to be an ally and remembers it has never been invited to dinner. At ten-fifty-nine something put its tongue behind the grille and said, ah. We were ready enough.

He liked to make an entrance even when he had agreed to pretend he wasn’t there. The first hint was the light from the path lamps bowing toward the water the way men bow to other men when money has come up in conversation at a funeral. The second was the sound of Elna’s hat making a decision to stay on her head regardless. The third was the smell, the velvet again, the library where the books are bound in things that used to be alive and the seating is for men with papers. He did not come in person. He brought a corridor. It ran along the culvert and along the air and along the fence and along the line of my jaw. It was as wide as my fear and as thin as the coin you throw in a charity fountain to pretend you are kind. It had wallpaper you can drink, if your mouth is shrewd. He said my name again and made it sound like a pill.

“Not tonight,” I said, because we had done the work and all that mattered was not making it pretty. “Not through there. Not in your green long hall. Not in any hall at all.”

He was amused, and his amusement pressed into my chest in the place people call the heart because we have not found a better word yet. oh, he said, and the sound of the word made the grill lean forward. you brought glue. how sweet. there are adult ways to negotiate rivers, little man. there are handshakes. you have brought me a paperweight.

“I have brought you a law,” Elna said, and I have never loved a person more than I loved her then because she said it like she was asking a dog to sit and then praising it when it did. “I have brought you a boundary. I have brought you a child back from the shape of your mouth. You may sit and watch if you like. You may take notes. You may be bored. I will not be performing beyond my contract.”

He made a door in the corridor as if to prove a point to himself. We did not look at it. The dog did, and then he sneezed and put his head under my hand in a way that said, You can be loved even when you are trying to catch a fish. The water pulled, angry and childish. The scab held. A girl with a phone came along with a boy in a jacket and they saw nothing but two adults with a dog looking at a fence, which is one of the oldest and safest English pastimes. We nodded, because you always nod to the people who are doing their best not to fall in love with each other too hard at twenty-two, and when they had gone the wind changed its mind and the corridor thinned.

He does not like being told no in public. He is not used to being told no in rooms where he has kept everything damp. He went, and the sudden emptiness he left is a thing you cannot put in a sentence without embarrassing yourself. The air was colder in the way cold can be after a fever. The dog licked my hand and caught the taste of the jar and sneezed again and looked at me like he was going to report me to someone for mild cruelty. Elna laid the last of the cord and tied it off in a sailor’s knot that had refused to be named by sailors, and she said, “He will come to your house now. He will knock on nothing. He will wait until you brush your teeth and tell you that you don’t have to if you don’t want to. He will make being ten feel like it lasted too long, and being thirty like a coat you had to put on to go into the rain. He will flatter you with the thought that you can be powerful and unhurt. He will make you think you made a mistake not going to him when he asked.”

“He doesn’t know how many mistakes I’ve made already,” I said, and the dog leaned on me in agreement. “He thinks he is the first. He thinks he is the only one with a table and a chair. He thinks he eats alone. He thinks the green belongs to him because he can pronounce the word. He thinks he made luck. He thinks—” and here I faltered in the way a throat does when a promise arrives to be signed, “—he thinks he can make me spend a day without counting planks and then call it freedom.”

We stood until the eleven-fifteen had gone over and the sound had shaken every coin in my pocket into the same corner as if they had been gathered for counting. We stood until the jar had stopped being itself and become a part of the place that could be left, a friendly lie with a skin and a price. We stood because sometimes the only spell is to not go home yet. Only when the dog had yawned and sat down without me having to say anything too humiliating did we move. Elna put her hand on my shoulder and said, “We are required to eat something greasy and judgmental now,” and we went and found chips that had been waiting for a night exactly like this.

At my flat the door had been polite. The onion skins did not rattle and the kettle did not aspire. The phone slept under the book like a small beast in a winter den. When I lifted the book the screen did not go green. It stayed black and showed me a narrow, honest version of my face. I got as far as brushing my teeth and the dog lay in the doorway on the exact line where I trip on days I am too full of myself. He watched me with that old soul expression dogs pick up in houses where men have thought too hard and too wrong for too long. “I won’t go,” I told him, because sometimes you tell a creature with no stake in your nobility the part you can’t tell your own aunt, and he stretched and put his paw over his nose and huffed once as if to say, You’re a slow learner and I like that in men.

The pipes did their old, tired morning sound at midnight because houses do not respect musicals, and then the room changed pressure. It was subtle, the way the air changes when a person important to you has entered a bar and you cannot see them yet. I felt him, which is not an admission, it is a measurement. He did not speak. He is not a fool. He changed the temperature of the water in the cistern by three degrees and waited for me to go to the toilet so that my body would learn to find him pleasant in a place where it does not generally find anything. I held it like a saint and counted, and the dog snored like an honest man. I did not say the secret between the numbers because I had it and I was saving it. I said the sandwich rhyme and it did nothing because I was not crossing anything, and I grinned for the first time since the bridge because if I do not consider him funny for trying, then the part of me that still imagines a castle and a bed will win. Somewhere else in the building somebody showered, and their water hit their skin, and if he was going to seduce anyone that night it would be them, not me. If I am to be hunted—and dear, I am—I would like to pick the field.

Before I lay down I wrote a list because lists make the part of me that could otherwise drown look up and swallow. It said: find a better jar. Remember that gifs of cats are not a magic; do not expect them to be. Get the linesman’s whistle back to him before he invents a second and hates the sound of it. Tell Kara to put a bowl of water on the front step with a spoon beside it and a note that says Not for you. Ask Aunt Bet about the bottle that isn’t the bottle. Ask Elna if she has ever seen a man’s shadow leave him and walk into a different room. Buy dog biscuits and pretend you always had them in the house. Practice not touching the water when you want to. Practice touching the dry.

When I slept, I slept like a person with a dog within arm’s reach and a whistle near my head and a man in green telling me I would enjoy myself more if I gave him my mouth for a bit. I dreamed a pond with a bottom like a thumb. I dreamed a house made of leaves where every leaf held a little light the size of a coin and he had arranged them by denomination. I dreamed Aunt Bet sitting on the till with a pin in her mouth and saying, “Men like him forget about lint,” and laughing until the whole shop shook and the jars chimed like a morgue for bees. I dreamed Elna in a dress that was paper and scissors both and a boy named Dan running along a platform not because he was leaving but because the trains looked like they might appreciate the respect of somebody trying to be faster than them. In every dream I had my boots, and in one of them, finally, I took them off and my feet did not feel like betrayal. It didn’t last, but the body remembers these things. It will be useful, even if only for seven minutes, which is a lifetime if what you are currently doing is not drowning.
