They raised us quiet in a city that never was. My nurse would press fingers to her lips whenever the sirens passed our windows and whisper, listen, listen, count between the pulses. She said if you could predict the intervals, you could live under anything. I learned to count quickly.

Aurelia sang in neon and ordinance. The banners were all women’s names, woman’s faces: the Matrons with their gold-lit pupils and slow wave of gloved hands from behind black glass. Their algorithms made traffic gentle only for them. We learned how to step off sidewalks when the Mother-Patrol approached, to lower our eyes without lowering our minds. A light went red whenever one of us—boys, men—dwelt too long in a public square. Fear wasn’t new; it was woven in like fiber.

I became rich because I hated the city too cleanly. Indren Systems, a ladder built from lenses and loopholes. We made the μGlass for the Matrons’ surveillance towers and the ocular ribbons that let you read your own heartbeat in the morning tea. I designed recursion engines that found patterns inside weather and inside people. Money came like weather across a bay: inevitable if you recognized the leverage. Power followed at a distance, skeptical and perfumed.

I used it to build refuge. The Palisade hung over the east spill, a whole face of the cliff shot through with terraces and greenhouses. There was a chapel with no icons, a pool under black stone, and rooms that had doors only I knew. Money let me bring my sister home when the doctors took their clipped breath in the hospitals and said words like porencephaly that meant nothing and everything. Mara, small and soft-eyed, prone to laughing in the wrong place and at the wrong time. She used to sneak pastries into Council sessions and make the floor stewards swear. When she became more fragile, she took to sitting in the citrus house under the moons and naming her seedlings like saints.

“You don’t have to look like that,” she told me. I was never good at arranging my face. “I’ve had this brain since I was born. It’s a glamorous curse. The Council would like it. Very sorceress.”

“You’re not dying,” I said. It was a thing you say. “You’re not even fading.”

“I forget more when I get tired. I get tired more,” she said. “Remember when we were small and you would hide paper money in the mouths of our teddy bears so Mother would never take it? Same thing. Some parts of me keep my parts of me safe. But the parts get narrower.”

“Your metaphors never improved,” I said, and she threw a lemon at my head.

We could have been a little happy in our absurd exile if the city had left us, but it never does. A man was found in the Lustrum Quarter with his mouth wired shut and a line carved in his chest that read, in old block letters, PAST DUE. Then another, floating in the reservoir with mirror shards under his eyelids and a ribbon around his wrist that announced FAILURE TO ADJUST. None of that mattered until the third was a partner of mine, and the fourth was a man I had known in school, and the fifth was a father of two who delivered flowers to the Palisade. We called him the Breather then, because a whistling recorded in three of the scene log files matched, approximately, the tremulous undertone of certain damaged respirators. Yes, yes, people joked—too much cinema in the city, too much play-acting. Later, the rumors got a name involved. An ancient villain from the old reels, half-myth now, who breathed like a machine and breathed forever. Related to Darth Vadar, someone wrote in acid on a Council plinth. The Mother-Sweepers scrubbed it off. The rumor did not forget itself.

Crime, in the Matrons’ city, is a female science. The Writ of Pursuit can only be held by women; the Council coders made it so even the drones respond to an octave, a timbre. We sisters, we mothers, we guardians, the billboards said. We protect the delicate order with firm hands and a century of listening. The old laws were burned; the new laws sheafed. The men are safe if they are invisible. Not me. Not anymore. Each time the Breather made a mark, he left it somewhere near a thing I valued. Not because he hated me, perhaps, but because the territory that fed me was also his. Fear is a territory.

The night the message arrived, the Palisade hummed like an organ. The auricular pane at the far end of the piano room became a face; we don’t have curtains strong enough to stop Council summons. Archon-Mother Talitha Strune, the Prime Matron of the eastern quarter, found me with her smile on. You could pull that smile off with tongs and it would still keep its shape.

“You have enemies,” Talitha said. Her eyes flicked across my profile; the software trimmed me like a hedge. “You have cultivated more than enemies.”

“Good evening, Archon,” I said, with just the right tilt. “We are cultivating lemons here. Won’t you take one to signify our common sourness.”

Her smile got wider by a line. Behind her, I could see the red braid and flat stance of her shoulders, a fan of bodyguards like a school of fish. Talitha always moved like she was being watched from a thousand angles because she was. “You find humor in the context of death. How masculine.”

“Death is feminine in this city,” I said. “Or haven’t you read your own press releases.”

“Mr. Indren. Cassian,” she changed, voice easing. “We can protect you. But there is a condition. All my protections have prices. All your protections do.”

I glanced at Mara; she had come in quietly and was leaning on the piano. She looked at me and made a face. A peach pit of disquiet sat under my tongue. “Your condition.”

“You will donate your recursion array to the Council. You will stop asking me who funds the Mother-Patrol. You will stop sheltering Mus, the archivist, who has been under Council watch for three years. Don’t look surprised. We see your household even when we don’t see your household. In return we will take your concern and turn it into dust.”

“And the Breather?” I said, speaking the nickname first, before I forgot how to. “Do you have interest in stopping him?”

“Always,” she said. “But he is not a matter of lawlessness. He is a matter of story. And we write story.”

“You mean you license it.”

She inclined her head. “You have seven hours to tell me you agree to our terms.”

Seven hours. Seven bleats of a small, wounded trumpet. The auricular pane dimmed; my reflection returned like a predictable ghost. Mara walked over. “I didn’t like her hair today,” she said. “Is it wrong to find your enemy ridiculous.”

“If that were wrong you would be wrong all the time,” I said. “Mara, go to bed. I have to call Quine.”

“Threnody?” Her eyebrows went up. “That old hyena. Tell her I still want her sweater.”

“She doesn’t know she promised you a sweater,” I said.

“She did,” Mara said. “But she didn’t say it out loud. Which is the kind best promises.”

Threnody Quine was a gene chef who had retired from the Council’s kitchen after she refused to cut the tongues out of a nest of singers and replace them with docile implants. She was my friend because we were both good at looking at wicked suggestions and pretending they were recipes. Her voice on the line was dry. “You never call for lemon tarts,” she said without greeting. “So this is going to be grim.”

“I need a legend,” I said. A shadow of the moon swam over the citrus house; the long leaves trembled like glass. “The old city rituals. Something… there was a thing you told me once. A binding. You take someone into you and you become two.”

“Don’t say it like that,” she said. “It sounds like poor opera. You don’t believe in ancestor cults. What happened to you, Cassian Indren. Who scared you.”

“The law,” I said. “And a man who breathes like a theater villain. Or the people who want me to think he does.”

“Ah,” she said, the sound like a spoon touching china. “There will be copies. There will be fakes. But this will be real. Do you remember the Echophage.”

“The word was too pretty,” I said. “I remember asking if it tasted good.”

“It doesn’t taste of anything,” she said. “What you will taste, if you are unblessed, is yourself. But the Echophage is not a ritual. It is a structure. Old bio-witches used it to keep their daughters in line across generational atrocities, to put a woman inside a man’s head so he couldn’t do a thing without the woman’s commentary. It is less formal than an organ transplant and more formal than a kiss. You will need tissue. Closest relative is easiest. A sister is optimal, if you have one. But you do.”

“I won’t,” I began, and then I looked at Mara, who was watching the moon like it would tell her its age if she stared long enough.

“Of course you won’t,” Threnody said. “Everyone who comes to me says they will not. It would be monstrous. It would be unacceptable. And then they arrange a small table with two chairs and a bowl that was once used for soup.”

“She’s ill,” I said softly. “She is… She forgets. If I could keep her inside me—”

“You see,” Threnody said. “How cleanly you become selfless. The city will love this story if anyone ever lets it be told.”

“I need a woman to hold a Writ,” I said. “All the enforcers listen to high voices. The drones listen to high voices. I can’t go hunt without someone. There’s a thing with the registers. I thought—if she were in me—”

“She would be a ticket. She would be an instrument you play to unlock doors.”

“She would be my sister,” I said.

“You should ask her,” Threnody said. “Not because I believe in consent in any pure form. But because if you don’t ask her, she will answer louder in you later.”

I hung up and I went to her without rehearsing. She spooked easily if she saw me practicing. She looked so fragile that even the shadow of what I was going to say seemed like a bruise. She made it easier by speaking first.

“If you look at me like that again, I’ll grow a second head,” she said. “Out of spite.”

“We could use it,” I said. “For perspective.”

“Tell me,” she said, serious now. “Tell it all.”

I told her. Not the words Threnody used, but the shape. I told her of the Echophage. I told her of law and voices and doors. I told her about waking in the middle of the night with the unspent scream of the reservoir boy in my throat, about how sometimes I hear the whistling of that impossible respirator in the walls of our house. I told her that I had a plan that would get me killed and a plan that would get me emptied and a plan that would turn me into a thing with two minds. I told her she could become my mind and we could hunt.

Mara listened, head tipped like a bird. Then she laughed—the short, sharp laugh she had when she hit something true with a stick and it made a hollow sound. “Terrible,” she said. “I adore it.”

“You do not adore it,” I said, suddenly furious. “You adore me. Which is not the same thing as adoring the idea of eating your bones.”

We were quiet. The lemon trees went on making tiny noises, the damp microclimate trying its best to simulate a world without weather.

She reached for my hand. “You will make it gentle,” she said. “You always did. You never pulled my hair hard even when I screamed at you. You hid apples for me see looked like I had friends in the drawers. You made the air warm when it had no reason to be warm. I am telling you that I am tired. I am telling you that if I slide out like a lamp that goes out because someone forgot to oil it, I will die before I die and that is less good. I would like to be with you when you do the worst thing you have ever done and believe that we did it together.”

“It is the worst thing,” I said, because I had to say it, and because making it true in the air would let me cut off other truths later. “I wouldn’t do it if I had another road. You know that.”

“I do,” she said. “We were never given roads. We were given stairs, and told we were lucky to have them.”

We called Threnody. She came up to the Palisade with a canvas bag and the sweater Mara wanted. It was badly knit. It had holes in the wrong places, as if a small animal had been consulted about the position of shoulders. It made Mara gleeful. Threnody looked at me like a butcher who also rescues pigs; she smelled faintly of fennel and iron.

“I should warn you,” she said, spreading instruments on a stone table with the casual care of a priest of accidents, “this is not a sacrament. It does not cleanse anything. If your enemy kills you later, it will not be because you did this but it will not be not because you did this. Also, there will be no blood in the way you imagine. Blood is show. This is mostly computation and a little anger.”

We followed her to the lab room that never had a name because the names made the walls shrink. The Echophage rig looked like a cradle someone had hammered into the wrong shape. It looked like a mistake. Good things often do. It drank current from the Palisade’s back spine and hummed in a frequency that made my teeth want to tell deathbed secrets.

“Last chance to refuse,” Threnody said to Mara as if the refusal could be pulled out like a thorn between one breath and the next.

Mara leaned back in the support and put her hands over her face as if to pray and then to hide that she was praying. “Do you remember the book Mother took from me when I was twelve,” she said, not looking at me. “The one with the women who lived in a city of men and made them kneel.”

“She took a lot of books,” I said.

“She took that one,” Mara said. “She gave it back to me when I was nineteen and said I should read it so I could know what they would make of me. But I didn’t read it then. I would like to read everything you see from now on.”

“I will mix you into him,” Threnody said. “There are membranes you can pass through in the mind. There are chemicals that will keep the gates half-open so that you do not shut him up entirely and he does not shut you up entirely. But both of you must be willing to be rude. Speak when you are not asked. Push when you are not invited.”

“Is this like a marriage,” Mara asked, and when Threnody ignored the line she made a face as if it was not what she wanted to find the humor of.

We began. Beginning is such a wrong word for the moment you step into a river that is already moving at a speed you cannot conceive. Mara breathed; Threnody measured the breath and played it back as electricity. There were coils with tiny teeth that kissed the back of Mara’s neck and took samples from her spinal lake. There were swabs from her inner cheek and whisper-thin blades that lifted the salt of her skin from her collarbone. There was less taking than I had prepared for. Most of what we took was pattern. Most of what we needed to ingest was a captured song. I sat opposite her with my tongue held low and my eyes on her face. I swallowed the capsules Threnody gave me; they dissolved in me without taste and made my stomach forget its compass. I held Mara’s gaze like those were instructions. It felt like nothing for a series of long minutes and then like sitting down on a seat in a train that was not there. I fell through. I caught myself in another breath. I was not ready and I was completely ready.

This is where the story could become grotesque if I let it. That is not the story I am telling. There was body, yes, there were the motions of eating and swallowing and the small involuntary sounds the throat makes when it is asked to be a road. But in the actual, in the interior, it was like heat moving toward another heat and learning to negotiate skin. The Echophage takes some tissue because the body loves form, but it is more interested in the echo of the tissue than the tissue. We are not meat is a thing the polite say at dinners. It is a lie. We are meat and echo. Threnody made me a bridge like a mother making an obscene craft for the school fair. Mara chose to cross.

She closed her eyes. I watched her lashes tremble and I counted between the tremors because my nurse taught me to do that. Something in me lit. She, my sister, stepped into me without feet. When I say step, what I mean is: there was the rush of her laugh in my ears when she was four and I pulled the sheet over us like a tent. There was the smell of the lemon soap she used when she was fifteen and wanted to be gentle with her own wrists after the Council had bound them with learning cords. There was the weight of her shoulder when she fell asleep on my shoulder in a transport that was so cold our teeth clicked. There was the stupid sweater against my face when we were nineteen and I told her a secret I will never write here. There was the taste of her taste of the world, the apple peel and the copper of a penny she had put in her mouth on a dare and the bitter swallow of the medicine she hated and my old shirt she wanted because it smelled like me. There was too much. It was all light. It was all sound. It was all a scramble of arithmetic. Then there was less, then there was enough.

“I’m here,” she said, but she did not say it out loud.

“You don’t sound like you,” I said, and then I realized I didn’t know what I meant by that because she sounded like herself and like me and like our mother in the good hour of the afternoon when she loved us fully.

“I sound like we do when we are being dangerous,” she said, and laughed again. Threnody made a noise—like hearing the first word of a language you invented.

“You’ll need time to settle,” Threnody said aloud so the room would stay a room and not turn into a fable. “You will feel you are overlapping. You are. Don’t drive heavy machinery, Mr. Indren. Don’t make policy. Don’t make oaths. For now you can make soup.”

“I feel like running,” Mara said, inside, and the muscles in my calves tightened because of it. “I feel like singing. Did you know that you have a splinter on the inside of your left index finger.”

“No,” I said. “Do you?”

“I do now,” she said. A pause, then, softer. “I don’t feel dead.”

“You are not,” I said, and my chest contracted in a way that made me think of ships going under bridges. “I would never.”

“I know,” she said. “I was trying to say something else but the language is busy.”

The first hour was busy. We learned how to tell each other joking from warning. She learned how to twitch my fingers without scaring me into dropping a glass. I learned how to set aside space in my head for a whisper that would not be a whisper forever. We tested the Writ. Threnody, with her pretty instruments, held a borrowed micro-drone in the middle of the lab and asked it to listen. When I, alone, said halt, the drone spat static and kept its line. When I let Mara come to the front of my throat, when I allowed her to thread our voice, when I made a sound that was ours, the drone stopped with a jerk like a badly trained dog.

“You have precedence,” Threnody said. “You are carrying a woman’s resonance inside a man’s mouth. The algorithms are not moral. They are obedient.”

“You have done this before,” I said.

“Never with a pair like you,” she said, and there was pride in it like a blade.

The Palisade felt smaller. All sanctuaries grow tight when you are about to use them as a spring. The city outside had the smell it has before an electrical storm; even the glass looks like it is trying to sweat. Talitha’s seven hours soured into minutes. I went to stand on the terrace and watch the east spill fold itself into glitter. A heavy breath moved across my scalp; I almost tilted my head into it like a pet. A memory of the whistling crawled up from the back stairs of the world and put its headquarters up between my eyes. I could smell steel, and older things under the steel.

“Listening,” Mara said, immediate. She was already a detective. She had always been a detective; her curiosity only needed a mandate and a name.

“This is when I would have told you to go to bed,” I said.

“This is when I don’t have to,” she replied, and there was such joy sparkling off the syllables that I had to sit down.

I had, sometimes, thought that I was brave. Because the city had not broken me in the ordinary ways. Because I had money and a house built like a cliff and a laugh for the Archon-Mother. I had not been brave. I understood that sitting there. I had been sheltered by my wealth and my rudeness and by my sister’s refusal to mark me as fragile. Courage, when it came, tasted like a bowl of water you put by your own bed. Necessary, plain, easy to knock over if you flail.

“What will we do now,” I asked her, as if there had been no plan beyond the nightmare we just made good.

“We will eat,” she said, with wickedness. I had been worried she would take my guilt and wear it like one of Threnody’s sweaters. She would not. “Then we will call the archivist and the sardine. Then we will put on shoes and go where the loud breathing is.”

“You are impatient,” I said.

“I am alive,” she said. “It’s new for me.”

Threnody left with a nod and a warning not to do anything she would have done, which covered most of the ethical landscape. The house reconfigured around us; the switches learned her; the lifts offered her their lowest selves; a thousand silent machine minds ticked over to a slightly different set of host privileges and did not know they had knelt. In the undercity a rumor grew a finger and tapped on the back of someone’s skull: Indren has made himself a choir. The first piece of mail addressed to Ms. Indren arrived on our pane before dawn and I laughed until I coughed.

We ate soup like good children. We called Mus, my archivist who kept too many dangerous things in a little room under a safer name. He appeared on the pane like a raven under a length of silk. His hair was mad. He had painted his eyelids with something that made them look like they belonged to someone else.

“You look tired,” Mus said, which in his language meant you look the same as you always have. “What exquisite crime have you asked of me now.”

“The rumor of the Breather. Where does it start. Where does it go when it’s tired of wandering,” I said.

Mus performed a small, theatrical shudder that also helped his brain. “He is not a he, they say. He is a partnership. He is an old soldier from the Theatre War. He has a cousin in the electronics in the Council Hall. He is a heretic who believes men should be allowed to speak in the morning. He is a machine that wants to be a family. And,” Mus leans close then, “he is related to Darth Vadar.”

“Vadar,” Mara said, correcting the A softly in my mind as if that mattered here. “People always spelled it wrong when we were small.”

“You hear her,” Mus said, and then he blinked. “Gods, Cassian. You did it. You lunatic. You dinner plate.”

“Speak slowly,” I told him. “Speak as if we are old people leaning on a balcony.”

He licked his lower lip. “Vadar is the old fiction, yes? Your nurse told you too many stories from the wrong era. The breathing villain with the black mask. It is a costume. It is a god. It is a father you can use to frighten children into obedience. The rumor in the lower quarter says our Breather is kin to him. That he is a descendant of one of the men who built the original mask. Or that he is an heir to the myth itself. He has a right to the breath. He has a right to take our oxygen and make us pay tax on it.”

“Debt theme,” Mara said to me. “He writes PAST DUE. He collects air.”

“Why would this city let him do this,” I asked, for myself. “Why would the Matrons permit a story they should crush.”

“Because it is useful,” Mus said. “Because fear must be maintained as well as manufactured. Because so long as he kills the right people, the wrong people will call you for soup.”

“Do you know where we will be able to listen to him,” Mara asked through me. There was a difference in the question when she was at the bow of it. The difference was a lessening of apology.

Mus made a gentle finger-wave that meant maybe. “Come to the Stoa after the third hour. The old women sell radios there that pick up the columns under the city. I know a grandmother who owes me a lie.”

We shut the pane; the room held the ghost of Mus’s requirement for heavier air. I stood and the world slipped sideways a fraction, then righted, then clicked into place like a spine that wanted to be good.

“We should tell the Archon no,” Mara said. “We should not tell her anything until after we are done.”

“She will take what she wants anyway,” I said. “But yes. Let us do the unlawful lawful things first.”

I put on the coat that makes me look like a nice idea in a bad area and Mara coiled herself in my nerves and made me stand up a little more narrowly, like a woman may stand when she wants the street to treat her like a blade instead of an oven. The lifts felt like stairs because in the mind every descent is a negotiation. The Palisade slid us down to the level where the old stones show through. Threnody had told me not to drive and I drove anyway because somewhere, in some long-ago, I promised myself I would always break one rule when I was sober and trying. The car did not disagree with us. It loved us. The city, for a moment, did not.

The Stoa is a market that pretends it is ancient because it has columns. The columns are poured polymer made to look like worn stone. The women are real. Their eyes weigh you like you are fish they plan to smoke later. We stepped into their cool shade and let the crowd fold around our shoulders. We walked between stalls of wired-up junk and knitted flags and jars of snail sauces with labels written by hands that shook and did not apologize for shaking. We walked like two in one because that is what we were.

“There,” Mara said, bright, and turned my head to a stall draped in faded red. The grandmother behind it wore a scarf that had been blue in some century. She was the kind of grandmother who takes one look at you and names your crimes. She smiled a very small smile at me and at me. “You have brought your chorus,” she said. “It makes sense. You are untidy.”

“We’d like a radio,” I said. “One that listens low.”

“We all do,” she said, unoffended. She picked up a brown plastic box with a cracked face and whispered at it. The face uncracked. “This will hear the pipes under your house. It will hear the pipes under the river. It will hear the song of the mother machines if they are half asleep. You will think it is whispering to you. It will not be. It will be whispering to itself.”

“We want it to hear a man,” Mara said.

The grandmother leaned closer, pin and needle in her stare. “Ah,” she said. “The boy who pretends to be an inheritance. He is loud. But he does not speak in a place like this, so you are safe until you are not.”

“Do you know him,” I asked.

“I know his mother,” she said. “That is always the more important information. In a city like ours.”

We paid with coin because paper made these women melancholy and digital made them suspicious. She wrapped the radio in a towel that looked like it had once been used to swaddle someone who is now very famous. We carried it back to the car like a lunch.

“He is related to the mask,” Mara said to me, when the doors shut us into the low perfume of air-conditioning. “Or he wants us to think he is. The theme again. Men pretending at fathers. Women permitting it because it makes their theater better.”

“Are you certain you want to do this,” I asked, not because I had doubt but because doubt is a ritual you go through to starve regret.

“Yes,” she said simply. “Ask me again tomorrow in case our stories changed.”

We drove the long way home. The city was full of ambulances and bicycles and small girls with huge knives in their belts because this is how their mothers love them. We passed a mural that was painted over itself so many times it had become a palimpsest of queens and warnings. There was a section left of a phrase that read, in silver: breathe. No one can help but do it. I thought of the Breather, of the rumor that he was kin to a mask from a film that might not be remembered by anyone who mattered now. I felt Mara feel it too. It is a strange luxury to not be the only one feeling a thing.

At the Palisade, we set the radio under the table and fed it a line from the house. It made a noise like the evening. I tuned; Mara tuned me tuning; the bands rolled past like strips of slick cloth. When I hit the right seam, it was not a voice that came through but a lull. Then a sound like an animal remembering. Then the whistle we knew.

“You,” I said to the air, and at the same time Mara said, only in me, hello. The two made a chord. The radio hiccuped. The whistle answered. It was the old cinema sound, yes, the dramatized mechanical respiration. But under it there was something else. A rhythm from here, not from there. You cannot fake the pace of a city.

He spoke, not to us, not to anyone in particular, the way a man might read his notes aloud on a bus and think that makes him invisible. “Recurrence,” he murmured. “Payment. Honor. Patriarchy is a breath held in a box. Open the box, lose the breath. Keep the box closed, suffocate. These are your choices.”

“Poet,” Mara scoffed. “Exhale, show-off.”

I did not laugh. That is the thing: there is a kind of horror that you recognize as kindred if you have ever loved the sound of your own theories. I felt a shiver go through me; it was not hers and not entirely mine.

“We will find him,” Mara said, fierce. “We will stop him. We will give the Council nothing of ours but our contempt.”

“Then we’d better get comfortable with how low we have to go,” I murmured. The radio made a sound like a heart deciding.

Night came on like a glance under a door. Talitha called twice. I let the pane darken and the calls fall into the quiet drawer. The house watched us. The city set its jaws for another round of nonsense and law. We had done the worst thing and nothing had improved and the world had shifted its balance anyway.

“Sleep,” I told her, because the body always wants the old commands.

“We will be awake together,” she said, and for a while we were. We made plans with too much detail and then no detail at all. We argued about shoes. We practiced having her lift my left hand and point with my right. When I finally lowered my eyes and let their sand creep in, she hummed in my head the rhythm of the siren my nurse loved and I counted mostly wrong, mostly on purpose.
