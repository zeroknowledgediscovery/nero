     "novel_text": "They say the rain in Oviedo carries the taste of iron, and I believed it before I ever tasted it. The city breathes slowly, even when buses come in coughing clouds and taxi drivers curse at tourists idling by the cathedral. I have lived here all my life; I have learned to use its rhythms the way one learns to use a metronome, grudgingly, with an ear tuned to the slight shift of seconds. I walk past the old bookstore on Calle San Francisco, the one that leans into its own shadow like a conspirator, and I nod to the woman who feeds pigeons more dutifully than any priest feeds his congregation. I keep my umbrella folded, even when it drizzles, just to feel the fine spray on my face. Some people call that stubbornness. I call it calibration.\n\nMost mornings I take the long route to the university, because the short route passes my old school and I am easily ambushed by the ghosts of teachers with dry voices. I prefer the university\u2019s smell: damp stone, coffee burned at the edges, notebooks unfurling like white flags. I am twenty-one, supposedly proficient in noticing the right details and ignoring the ones that land like needles beneath the skin. Supposedly.\n\nWe live in a flat with a balcony that almost faces nothing: a sliver of street, a distant chimney, a bird that always looks like it has somewhere else to be. It became ours the way most things do\u2014someone else moved out of it, and we moved in. My father has a habit of arriving in rooms half a step before his shadow, and the night he came home with her, he stood in the doorway too long, as if he had miscounted his own footsteps.\n\n\u201cThis is my daughter,\u201d he said, turning to include me, though I had already been there, coiled like a spring on the sofa. \u201cAnd this is\u2014this is Alba.\u201d\n\nHe didn't say \u201cAlba is your\u2014\u201d because the word step-sister sat in his mouth like a coin he had forgotten how to spend. The legal papers had not yet been notarized, but the logic of the situation was simple. He married her mother, and two families became a single inventory. Chairs, plates, winter coats, griefs, habits. You think you can list them. You cannot.\n\nShe was taller than me by a head and a question mark. Her hair was black, not the soft brown of my father\u2019s beard or the lighter ash that my mother\u2019s photographs show me, and when she raised her eyes I felt something change in the room's size. You should know I am not easily impressed by eyes. But these eyes\u2014they were like two storms that had decided to become lakes. You could drink from them. You could drown, if that\u2019s what you wanted. I thought I knew what I wanted. Then I met her.\n\n\"Hi,\" she said, and her voice was warmer than the radiator in December. She wore a white shirt tucked into jeans and a wristwatch that ticked audibly. \"Your dad said you liked Thelonious Monk? My stepfather\u2014our stepfather, sorry\u2014he said that.\"\n\n\u201cHe did?\u201d I looked at my father, who looked at the floor. I had played one Monk record twice, three years ago, when I was trying to get through a breakup and a bottle. I failed at both. If you ask me to name a favorite musician, I say \u201cit changes\u201d in a voice that makes it sound like I am being generous.\n\n\"Yeah,\" she said. \"I brought some records. We can play them, if you want.\"\n\n\u201cWe don't have a record player,\u201d I said, and then felt stupid. But she smiled. \"We have one in the car,\" she said. \"I wasn\u2019t sure, so I brought it. I tend to bring my own weather.\"\n\nShe brought more than weather into our flat: she brought light into corners that had resigned themselves to darkness. She unpacked smooth plates and a cactus with bruised arms and a lemon-yellow kettle that whistled like a mile-long train, a kettle that would scald us into wakefulness every morning. She brought a poster of a city that wasn\u2019t Oviedo (Lisbon, yellow tram caught mid-sigh), a scarf with constellations printed across it, a jar of buttons. She brought her mother, who looked at my father with eyes full of forgiveness and math. Together we lined the shelves. Together we pressed ourselves into the smallness of a kitchen that was suddenly a stage where four people practiced the choreography of a new family.\n\nNight fell like a hand over the windows. We ate tortilla and smooth slices of tomato and something from a jar that Alba had made, peppers swimming in oil and garlic and vinegar. What is it called? Escabeche. I pulled a chair close to the table and listened to them talk about the easy details of merging: who takes out the trash which day, who buys the salt, who remembers to lock the balcony door, how eggs always go missing in families. From time to time I caught Alba\u2019s eye across the table, and her smile was small and true, like a ribbon tied where nobody else would see.\n\n\"And what do you study?\" she asked me, halfway through a second glass of wine.\n\n\"Linguistics,\" I said. \"Words about words.\"\n\n\"Ah! So you carry a mirror to the world, and there's a mirror inside, and another mirror inside that. Or I am mixing it up with barber shops.\"\n\n\"I can do barber shops, too,\" I said, and everyone laughed. And later, when the laughter had become the hum of dishes and the itch of sleep, I stood at the sink and Alba dried the plates, and we talked about the things that reveal nothing until you discover what they were hiding. We didn't talk about mothers or fathers or who had come from which direction, because those were obvious, or at least publicly obvious. We talked about the bus routes she had studied of her new city, the secret timetable of rain, the way the pigeons on the cathedral know the schedule of the human soul.\n\n\"What about you? What were you doing?\" I asked, making a shape with my palms in soapy water. \"Before here?\"\n\n\"I was in Le\u00f3n,\" she said. \"Studying architecture. But I needed a change of air. Nothing dramatic. I didn't have to be saved. I just wanted to look at new roofs.\"\n\nIt sounded almost like a joke. It was not. There are jokes that open the door to a secret, and there are sentences like this, which are keys.\n\nThat night I lay in my bed and listened to the new sounds of a house that had grown by one heart, then another. Alba's room was the one across the hall from mine, the one with the window that faced the sliver of street and the chimney; she had placed the cactus on the sill, as if she were warning pigeons that this was a thorned place. I heard her move around and then settle. I counted the beats between my pulse and hers, as if the walls had become a stethoscope. Past midnight, I got up to drink water. The low lamp in the living room cast a lemon half-glow over the record player she had set on the cabinet. Beside it, a paper bag. I pulled it open and saw a stack of records, different shades of cardboard and memory. Thelonious Monk really was there, \u201cSolo Monk,\u201d next to Nina Simone and a band I had never heard of, and something that had no label, just a hand-drawn crescent moon.\n\nI didn't play anything. I replaced the bag, went to bed, and slept five minutes at a time, like a cat waking on the hour to observe the world\u2019s ongoing disaster. Maybe this is this. Maybe this is one of those crossroads I have been told to avoid. Maybe it is one of those crossroads you step into and then become road yourself. I was not na\u00efve. I knew the words for almost everything. But names fail when the truth becomes a person in the next room, asleep.\n\nMy mother\u2019s picture on the dresser watched me with its old-gold sadness. She had left when I was eleven, for a city whose name my father still avoids. Not dead, but not here, which is its own kind of ghosting. When I met Alba, I thought, casually, you remember those faces you see once and then never again but they stay? That. That was my first thought. It was not good or bad. It was just the truth.\n\nThe city rose and sank. Alba learned to walk Oviedo the way a dancer learns to walk normal when she must. I learned the new weight of silence when her door was closed. We found rituals. We made breakfast together on Thursdays and argued over the crispness of bacon we could barely afford. We went shopping for things that seemed to multiply when you tried to count them\u2014sponges, carrots, pens\u2014and we carried them home in string bags that cut into our palms in a way that felt like proof. Proof of what? That we had hands, that they did more than satisfy our phones, that we could still build something more substantial than lists.\n\nMy best friend Mara from the university said, \"So, what's she like,\" in the half-mocking way only a best friend can manage. We were eating empanadas on the steps of a building that was pretending to be a castle. I gave her the surface answers: tall, funny, architecture, Le\u00f3n. I did not tell her the deeper fact: that when Alba stood in a doorway I wanted to catalogue the shadows she erased.\n\n\"You going to play her the Monk record?\" Mara asked.\n\n\"Already did,\" I lied. \"She was unimpressed.\"\n\nMara squinted at me. She has a face built for skepticism, a mouth that curves naturally into \"Really?\" \"Careful, T,\" she said. \"Families are like... you know when you fill a glass to the brim and it holds just slightly more water than it should, because of surface tension? And then you move it one millimeter and it spills. That.\"\n\n\"I'm not moving,\" I said. I was lying to her and to myself, in the same breath, the way bees talk to one another about flowers they haven't found yet.\n\nWe spent a Saturday afternoon at the Museum of Fine Arts because it was free and dry and large enough for people to disappear inside. Alba studied buildings in paintings the way a surgeon might look at a hand. She tilted her head as if dissections could be done at that angle. I drifted from room to room, reading placards and thinking about the paint that thickens and thins across a canvas, the way you can see time as a substance. When we met in front of a painting of a street in a rainstorm, she said, quietly, \"They always make the rain look clean. It isn't. It always has a little of the city in it.\"\n\n\"You're new here,\" I said. \"You can't be nostalgic yet.\"\n\n\"Maybe I am not nostalgic,\" she said. \"Maybe I am just precise.\"\n\nWe ate sandwiches in the courtyard. I don't remember what was in them. I remember the way her sleeve brushed my wrist and electricity traveled up my arm like a rumor that wouldn't die. I remember thinking: say nothing. That is the rule. Keep the words inside. They are yours. You don't have to donate them to the catastrophe fund.\n\nMy father stumbled into a happiness he wore like a jacket two sizes too big. He whistled in the mornings, a thing he had not done since I was small, and he looked at his phone at dinner the way teenagers do: not to escape but to take pictures of pasta, to show the world, \u201cLook, proof, evidence, an ordinary holiness.\u201d Alba\u2019s mother laughed when he sent them, teasing him, and he let her. You could see him learning to be seen, which is harder for men of his generation than anyone admits.\n\nOne night, after we had gone to the weekly jazz jam in a bar that pretended it was in New Orleans and still managed to be convincingly here, we walked home through the kind of drizzle Oviedo deploys when it wants to remind you that an umbrella is not a structure so much as a symbol. Alba tucked her hair behind her ears and looked up at a balcony where a cat sat like a judgment carved in stone.\n\n\"I've never liked cats,\" she said. \"They look at you like you're a plot twist they saw coming.\"\n\n\"I like that,\" I said. \"It means you can't surprise them, so if you manage to, wow.\"\n\n\"And you?\" she said. \"Do you like to be surprised?\"\n\n\"I like to be prepared for surprises,\" I said. We both laughed because it was such a Tallulah thing to say, and because it was impossible. A week later, she would be sick. A week later, I would learn exactly how little preparation is worth.\n\nBut this is not the story of a sickness, not exactly. Or, if it is, it is the story of a city that lowers its eyes when people cough in winter and of a hospital that hums regardless of who is watching.\n\nShe came out of the bathroom on a Tuesday morning looking pale but amused. \"The water is making a strange sound,\" she said.\n\n\"That's because the building is a decade older than God,\" I said, buttering toast with an aggression that was not about the toast. \"It needs to sigh before it functions.\"\n\n\"No, it's\u2014\" she started, and then she put a hand to her forehead. \"I think I'm\u2014\"\n\n\"Sit,\" I said, not knowing what else to do except wield the imperative. I pressed two fingers to her wrist as if I had become a nurse without training. The pulse was there, fast like a rabbit in a hedge. Her skin was hot.\n\n\"Maybe it's nothing,\" she said. \"Maybe I'm dramatic. You know I have that capacity.\"\n\n\"Me too,\" I said, but we did the sensible thing and took her temperature. The number blinked at us, then settled into a range that makes mothers worry even if they are two cities away. We made tea. We called the hotline the university sent around with flu season warnings. It was the season. The voice on the line was calm.\n\n\"Rest, fluids,\" the voice said. \"If she has other symptoms\u2014\"\n\n\"What other symptoms,\" I said, as if I could outrun them by listing them.\n\n\"Shortness of breath. Chest pain. Confusion.\"\n\n\"She already has confusion,\" I said, and Alba laughed, reflexively. The laughter ended in a cough that sounded like a nail in a board, sharp, bright, inevitable.\n\n\"Call us back if it gets worse,\" the voice said, and then we were alone with the tea and the pink tiles and the responsibility adults carry even when they pretend they do not. She carried herself to bed and I brought her water and the lemon-yellow kettle sang its long train song and the morning took on the hush of a church where somebody is praying too hard.\n\nHer mother called and called again. My father, at work, came home early and then left again because work has that way of believing in its own necessity. Alba slept. I sat by her and read from my linguistics textbook, words about words that did not make words behave. She woke and smiled and said, \"You're using your voice like a blanket,\" and I said, \"Go back to sleep.\" Outside, a siren went by that sounded like a child trying not to cry.\n\nWhen the fever climbed a second step we called a taxi. The driver had a face like a saint\u2019s statue left in the rain too long but his hands were steady. \"Hospitals,\" he said, in the tone people use when they mean, \"Another one.\" He made the city small, and the hospital grew large at the edge of it, white and humming, a ship in harbor. We went in with our paper masks and our quiet fear. They took her, they talked to her, they measured her, I waited. I was useless and entirely necessary in the way loved ones are: I answered the questions she couldn't be bothered to answer, I offered nothing useful but my presence. It is not nothing. Even when it feels like it is.\n\n\"There is a bed,\" the nurse said, with that shy triumph they wear when they can give you the one thing you want that they can actually give. \"It will be a day or two, maybe more. Fever. Hydration. You know.\"\n\n\"I know,\" I said, and I did and I did not. I wanted to argue with the air because it had failed to stay invisible in the right ways.\n\nThey moved her to a room in a wing with white corridors and blue signs that called themselves by numbers. 3C. Room 12. The walls were the wrong shade of forgiveness. The window faced a parking lot that believed in its own optimism because of one tree that had not yet given up its leaves. She was installed like a patient in a textbook illustration: bed, monitor, table with rolling wheels. The nurse stuck a name on the door like a badge on a uniform.\n\n\"I'll stay,\" I said, but there were rules, and they were rules because people are not good at not being near one another when one of them is burning. Visiting hours. Masking. Hand gel. Watch the trickle of numbers on the screen as if they were the score of a game you could influence by sheer attention. I did not like the rules. I obeyed them.\n\nShe settled under thin blankets and made a joke that made the nurse laugh and the nurse said, \"We like you. You're not the crying kind.\" I was the crying kind. I cried in the bathroom stall where the soap smelled like oranges. I cried in the cafeteria when they announced that the arroz a la cubana was finished. I called Mara and said nothing until she said, \"You sound like air in a bottle. Do you have what you need?\"\n\n\"She is okay,\" I said. \"They say she's okay. Fever. Rest. The usual.\"\n\n\"The usual is the most terrifying thing,\" Mara said. \"Do you need me to come?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, because it had to be no. Not for any noble reason. Because my panic had narrowed into a thin passage that would not allow other bodies.\n\nWhen I returned to the ward, she was asleep, and a young woman sat in the chair by her bed with a script balanced on her knees. Her hair was shaved on one side, dyed blue on the other, and her fingers shaped words in the air as if she were casting spells. She saw me and stood up quickly.\n\n\"I\u2019m sorry,\" she said. \"I didn't want to\u2014 I was waiting for the nurse. They said your\u2014your sister? She was dozing. I'm Carmen. They put me here yesterday. I talk. A lot.\"\n\n\"It's okay,\" I said, surprised by the sudden relief of another human who was not a nurse or a vending machine. \"I'm Tallulah.\"\n\n\"Beautiful name,\" she said, as if offering me back myself. \"I\u2014 I'm in theater. Well. I study theater. Sometimes I pretend hospital rooms are stages. It helps. With the fear.\"\n\n\"Does it?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes and no,\" she said. \"Everything helps. Nothing helps. Sorry. I say contradictory things when I haven't eaten. Do you want peanuts? I have fifteen packages.\"\n\nWe laughed softly the way people do in libraries and church. Alba shifted and opened her eyes. When she saw an extra person in the room, she smiled, a ghost of her usual brightness, but a brightness nonetheless.\n\n\"This is Carmen,\" I said. \"Our neighbor. Of geography, not life.\"\n\n\"Hi,\" Alba said, and Carmen\u2019s fingers shaped a hello in midair. Later I would learn she had a deaf brother and a habit of signing even when nobody else could understand. Later I would learn she had the kind of energy that makes hospitals less like ships and more like docks where you could lean and talk to someone about what the sea had taken. Later, too, I would learn to hate her with a ferocity reserved for saints. Not because she did anything wrong. Because she existed where I wanted to be the only one.\n\nYou see the fix, right? The equation that shows its teeth but not its solution?\n\nThe nurse came in and told me I had to leave, because the clock had rolled into a square called Visiting Ends. I wanted to argue with numbers. I did not. Alba squeezed my hand. Her fingers were warm, no longer too hot. \"Go,\" she said. \"Sleep. Bring me a list of streets that have trees. The city has many. I want to remember them from here.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I said. \"I'll bring you a list.\" She smiled like a lit match.\n\nOutside, night had become a glaze of rain over cars that could not be bothered to shine. I walked home with the lemon-yellow kettle singing in my head. The flat was more empty than it should have been, even with my father and Alba\u2019s mother making tea, their voices careful and bent. I told them what they wanted to hear: that she was better, that the nurse liked her, that the window had a view of a tree. They clung to those facts as if they were handholds on a cliff. Later, when their room was silent and the city yawned and rearranged itself, I wrote a list of tree streets. Calle del Rosal. Avenida de Galicia. The little square by the pastry shop where the plane trees pretend to be flocks of sheep. I fell asleep with the list under my hand.\n\nDays do what they do best: they pass. Alba slept; she woke; she made friends with a volunteer who played guitar on Tuesdays and a nurse with a tattoo of a key behind her ear and a boy with a broken arm who wanted to know every story an adult carries but never offers to boys in casts. She sent me messages that were sometimes misspelled and sometimes sublime.\n\nThey have a banana pudding machine here, she wrote. It is like a miracle glued to a plug.\n\nYou would like nurse Ana, she wrote. She says words like \"spectacular\" about small things, and then she does not retract.\n\nCarmen says hello. She brought me a play with a character who only speaks in questions. Do you imagine what that would be like? Are you exhausted yet, just thinking about it?\n\nI imagined it. I was exhausted. I was also incandescent with the kind of jealousy that has no place beside a blood pressure cuff. The hospital had become a city of its own, with its own weather and customs, and she had begun to live in it with a grace that made me proud and furious. What is the opposite of loneliness? It is not company. It is being needed. I was less needed. That is good, you will tell me. That is exactly the thing you want when someone you love is ill: you want the illness to release its teeth. I know. I know. But the human heart has a perverse engine. Ask anybody.\n\nI went to my classes. I turned in an essay that argued that the word \"stone\" has different weights depending on who carries it. It was not my best work. I talked to Mara in the cafeteria and she looked at my face the way doctors look at X-rays.\n\n\"You should say something,\" she said.\n\n\"Say what? 'Hi, I have fallen in love with my step-sister, and also she has the flu, which is a terrible plot for a student film.'\"\n\n\"Say that,\" she said. \"To me, for starters, you idiot.\"\n\nI looked at my hands. I had always liked my hands: competent, almost pretty, capable of balancing coffee mugs and sentences. They looked untrustworthy now, like tools left in the rain. \"It will pass,\" I said.\n\n\"Which part?\"\n\n\"The feeling. The flu. Both. Neither. Shut up.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" she said, and then she did me the kindness of changing the subject to a professor we both hated because he smiled when he said sadism-adjacent things. I loved her for that.\n\nIn the evening, I took Alba the list. She used her finger to trace the names as if feeling their bark through paper. Carmen sat on the windowsill in a position that would have broken an ordinary spine and read aloud from her play. The boy with the cast wandered in and listened and then wandered out when an orderly told him to. Nurse Ana leaned in, said \"Spectacular,\" and left. The room had become a crossroads where stories paused, exchanged glances, went on. I hovered like a lamp. I offered water. I touched Alba\u2019s forehead with the back of my hand and made a joke about my medical degree. She laughed and then coughed and then laughed again.\n\n\"You're getting better,\" I said, but I meant, You are moving away from me into a space I do not own.\n\n\"Am I?\" she said. \"I feel like a page in a book somebody else is writing. Oh\u2014Carmen, read the part where the question-woman asks the mirror if this is her face or just practice.\"\n\nCarmen read it with too much feeling and it was perfect.\n\nLater, I walked home alone again. It is a short walk, but there are nights when it expands like a lung. The rain that night was careful. It kept to its lanes. My father had left me a note in the kitchen\u2014Went to get soup. How is she?\u2014and then three question marks that tried to look like flowers. I made tea. I sat at the table with my linguistics book open and did not see any words at all. I thought of Alba's smile at Carmen's reading. I thought of Carmen's hands drawing words in the air. I thought about how the human heart is a badly designed room: no exits, too many doors.\n\nIt would be too simple to say: that was when I started to break. It is never just one moment. It is a sequence of almosts. The glass of water you almost dropped. The call you almost answered. The word you almost said. The night I did break, I woke before dawn to a dream of the balcony and the cactus unfolding small white flowers that smelled like milk. I went to the window and watched the street shine under the new day\u2019s first thin brush. The city was briefly innocent. I felt the thing in me that had been holding together, despite itself, begin to unknit. Not a dramatic rending. A careful undoing, the way my grandmother used to take out the stitches of a sweater that had gone wrong because nobody had wanted to admit it.\n\nThat morning the hospital put up a sign about visitor limits and flu season. It had always been there in spirit; now it was there in blue letters. \"We need to reduce contact.\" Carmen sent me a message: They\u2019re saying fewer visitors, shorter times. Don\u2019t hate me. I\u2019m already here because of the ward next door. I can peek. Guilt is my superpower.\n\nI stared at my phone. Then I turned it off. Then on again. I went at the appointed time and they were strict at the desk. The nurse with the key tattoo put her hand on my arm. \"We'll make sure she's okay,\" she said. \"You can call at night; I can hold up the phone. She likes your lists. Bring another list. Of sounds.\"\n\n\"Of sounds,\" I echoed, because I am a very obedient person when given the right kinds of impossible tasks.\n\nI sat with Alba and made a list of sounds while the minutes shrank into their own copies. The kettle. The bus braking on the hill. The pigeons pretending to be applause. The neighbor who sings as if he lives under the ocean, everything bubbled. She added her own: the hospital\u2019s bottle of gel clicking, the paper curtain moving as if it were breathing, Carmen\u2019s laughter. We made a list that took us to the end of visiting hours. When the nurse said time, I had nothing to argue with. Not numbers, not God. I kissed the crown of her head, quick, light, not the way I wanted. She closed her eyes in a way that was an answer without language. Then she turned her face towards the window, towards the tree that insisted on its own leaves.\n\nI walked out under the sign that reminded me to clean my hands. I walked down the corridor that smelled like weak coffee and perseverance. I walked into a city that had decided it was November even if the calendar had not fully agreed. I walked home to a flat that had too much air in it and closed the door too gently. I looked at the record player and the bag at its side and pulled out the unmarked record with the crescent moon and set it on the platter and lowered the needle, the soft drop, the quiet crackle. Music began. It sounded like a dawn that could be delayed with the right word, if only I knew it.\n\nI did not know it.\n\nIt was in that stretch of days, close enough to the beginning to still be considered an introduction, that the future grew a hinge. I did not notice it. Hinges are like that: visible, unremarked, the reason doors open and close. If you want to know when doors are significant, you look at the metal that moves them. You listen for the hinge. But I was listening to a record, and rain, and the kettle singing its train song. I was watching a cactus for flowers.\n\nIn the hospital, Alba learned the names of night nurses\u2014Luc\u00eda, Jos\u00e9, a man called Nano who hummed under his breath\u2014and Carmen started a game where she collected the small lies hospital signs tell, like \u201cha ocurrido\u201d instead of \u201cest\u00e1 ocurriendo\u201d and \u201csilencio\u201d that nobody obeyed. She made Alba laugh until she coughed and then brought her water and apologized and did it again. The boy with the cast drew a picture of a ship that was really a bed with wheels and gave it to Alba and she taped it to the wall with medical tape because she had decided to live there, for now, and a wall without children's art is a wall that thinks too well of itself.\n\nI tried to carry on. But the city had shifted, its iron taste stronger in the rain, its pigeons more like confessions with wings. On the fourth night, I woke to the sound of a siren that did not fade. I sat up and waited for it to halve, then quarter, then silence. It did not. In the morning, the hospital called and said nothing alarming, and I exhaled in outrage at my own body for having held breath for hours. We adapt; we shatter; we adapt. There is a sequence there, and we move through it like dancers who pretend they invented the steps.\n\nWhen Alba was finally feverless for a day and then two, the rules did not bend but they stopped pressing on my sternum. I could stay a fraction longer. I could bring in oranges and peel them for her at the little table and the room smelled like something living. I could watch her sleep without doing the unkind math of what I might lose. It deserves to be remembered: those days existed. The ones before I let the hinge become a crack become a way into a different story. The ones before I moved toward that door and opened it with my bare hands.Chapter 2 began on a morning that looked like a clean plate, and if you have ever cleaned a plate in a hurry you know it only pretends to be spotless; there is always a smudge if you tilt it the right way. The city had rinsed itself overnight and stood there dripping, proud of its drainage. Buses breathed like animals that had just discovered lungs. The woman with the pigeons was already in position, her scarf knotted as if it had opinions about knots. I left the flat with a bag of oranges and a book I had no intention of reading, and I told myself this was an errand, humility itself, not a decision that would rearrange the furniture in my head. I was practicing lying to myself in the minor key.\n\nAt the hospital the blue sign about visitor limits had acquired a new strip of tape that made it look medically important, and the woman at the desk wore an expression that said she was tired of being the favorite aunt of bad news. I was a little early and a little ridiculous with my oranges and my book and my certainty that rules belonged to other people. Nano was at the end of the corridor, a roll of tape looped on his wrist and a pen tucked behind his ear like a cigarette from a different decade. He hummed something that could have been a lullaby or a football chant if you sped it up. When he saw me, he leaned against the wall as if it were an old friend and considered me the way a locksmith considers a key that looks wrong and might still open the door.\n\n\"You are early,\" he said, and there was a smile tucked inside the remark like a folded ticket.\n\n\"Only by the clock,\" I said, because I have never been able to resist an opportunity to be annoying. I lifted the bag. \"I brought oranges. They are innocent. They improve rooms.\"\n\n\"They stain sheets,\" he said, which was both true and beside the point. He gestured at the door. \"Two minutes. If a dragon sticks its head out of the ceiling tiles, you didn\u2019t see me.\"\n\n\"Never,\" I said, and he let me pass, which felt like walking into a small conspiracy that smelled faintly of antiseptic and forgiveness.\n\nAlba was asleep, her mouth slightly open in a way she would have edited out of any photograph. She had that hospital pallor that looks like it was painted on to match the walls, but the heat had left her forehead and taken its bright hammer with it. The tree outside insisted on being the kind of green that ignores weather. I put the bag on the table and sat and watched her breathe, and I thought about how breathing is a thing you do wrong as soon as you notice you are doing it. The book stayed closed. I do not know if oranges can improve rooms, but their smell can make even caution blink.\n\n\"Hey,\" she said after a minute that was more like ten, because hospital minutes are long trains that stop at every station. Her voice was made of dust motes and relief. \"Are we breaking laws?\"\n\n\"Only petty ones,\" I said. \"No dragons have objected.\"\n\n\"Good,\" she said, and she closed her eyes again and then opened them like someone stepping back into a doorway to ask one more question. \"What did the city do?\"\n\n\"It practiced,\" I said. \"It stretched its rain like a cat. The pigeons were early. The buses remembered their lines. Your mother sent a message made entirely of hearts and one tomato.\"\n\n\"Of course she did,\" she said, and that made both of us laugh softly in a way that did not wake the machines. I peeled an orange, careful to keep the peel in one piece, because sometimes useless skills are proof that you have a right to exist. I offered her a segment and she took it as if accepting a treaty. We ate in silence. The nurse with the key tattoo came in and said good morning in a voice that could have been poured over pancakes, checked numbers, declared them satisfying, and left the smell of coffee behind her like an afterthought.\n\n\"Are we allowed to eat?\" I asked, when the nurse was gone, because I needed to be corrected by a rule to feel real.\n\n\"No,\" Alba said. \"But oranges don't count. They are spherical permissions.\"\n\n\"That is not how it works,\" I said, and she smiled at me the way people smile when they agree and will not admit it. She looked at the window, at the tree that had become our third guest, and then at the bag by my feet. \"What is the book?\"\n\n\"A grammar,\" I said. \"Spanish morphosyntax. The kind of thing that makes time slow enough to be measured with a protractor.\"\n\n\"Read me a sentence,\" she said, and I obeyed, because I am very obedient when obeying gives me an excuse to be near her. I read about clitics and the particle se and the way language makes choices you didn't vote for. She closed her eyes and listened to me ruin everything beautiful about language and we were both comforted,, which is one of the strangest tricks of love, when it goes right.\n\nCarmen appeared in the doorway with a coffee cup and a stack of paper that might have been a script or a petition to abolish hospitals. She wore a sweater with holes that were either fashionable or sincere; with Carmen you could rarely tell. She saw me and stopped and raised the coffee in a gesture that was both salute and apology.\n\n\"They let you in early,\" she said. \"You must have bribed someone with oranges.\"\n\n\"Nano is susceptible,\" I said. \"He senses citrus and loses his ethics.\"\n\n\"Good to know,\" she said, and she stepped in, and the room did change in size, even if I would deny it. She put her coffee on the windowsill and touched the tape on the boy-with-cast's ship picture as if to test whether it was still attached, which I resented for no reason that I could explain. \"How are we?\"\n\n\"We are practicing breathing,\" Alba said. \"Tallulah just taught me that oranges are spherical permissions.\"\n\n\"Of course they are,\" Carmen said, delighting in a world where nonsense could be elevated to doctrine. \"I brought\u2014aha\u2014\" She shuffled through her pages and frowned. \"Well. I brought a monologue in which the character tries to remember a city only by listening to it. Perfect for your list of sounds.\"\n\n\"Perfect,\" Alba said. \"Read it.\"\n\nI sat there like a chair that had decided to have opinions. Carmen read, and she is very good at reading; her voice knows where sentences want to be held and where they want to be dropped. I watched Alba's face relax into that place it goes when somebody else carries her for a minute, and I wanted to be gracious enough to be only relieved. I was not. Jealousy is a hungry animal with soft paws; it sits on your lap and purrs and then, when you reach to pet it, it reminds you what claws can do. I said something kind, because I am good at kindness when anyone is listening, and then I left because the minute had turned back into a clock and Nano's dragon had probably returned, impatient.\n\nThere is a way to walk angry in a hospital and not frighten anybody, and I learned it that morning. You keep your face polite and your anger in your elbows. You stand at the hand gel dispensers and practice washing your hands like a saint being painted. You let the smell of orange and alcohol compete in your nose. You go outside and the rain taps you on the forehead and suggests you get over yourself. I walked to the university with the bag now light with the absence of oranges and with my book feeling like ballast, and I told myself the sentence I had been avoiding: You are not the only person with a voice she likes. I tried it in different accents. It did not improve.\n\nMara was in the cafeteria, stabbing a croissant with a fork like a tiny gladiator. She watched me approach and did a theatrical squint that Carmen would have appreciated. \"How's the miracle ward?\" she said. \"How is our architecture saint?\"\n\n\"Feverless,\" I said. \"They might release her tomorrow. Or the next day. She laughs at Carmen's jokes until she coughs.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Mara said, and she did not smile, because she understands me to an uncomfortable precision. \"And you laugh at Carmen's jokes until you want to punch something.\"\n\n\"I am not violent,\" I said, and then, because she is my friend and she has earned certain words, I added, \"I dislike how good she is at being human near Alba.\"\n\n\"Mm,\" Mara said, doing something devastating with three letters. She tore the croissant in half and handed me the bigger piece with the solemnity of a communion. \"You're going to have to be brave in one of two directions.\"\n\n\"Define,\" I said, even though definitions are what I do for sport.\n\n\"Tell Alba something true,\" she said, \"or tell yourself something true and then live like it. You can't keep pretending you are furniture. You'll get dusted.\"\n\n\"She is my step-sister,\" I said, and the word did its old coin trick in my mouth, refusing to be spent.\n\n\"Not yet,\" she said, because she is cruel and accurate. \"And even if she is, the heart does not get a family tree. It gets a map with certain roads closed and then it goes off-road anyway, breaking its shocks.\"\n\n\"I hate your metaphors,\" I said, and she patted my hand in a way that made me forgive her immediately. We ate, and we spoke of a professor who does not believe in commas except when he uses too many, and I went to a class where I learned nothing except that every language has a way to apologize too much, and then I texted my father to tell him I would bring home bread.\n\nAt home the kettle drew its whistle as if it were trying to command a train to stop under our window. Alba's mother had left a bouquet of parsley on the counter like a joke about flowers. My father was in the living room, scrolling through pictures of soup bowls, because his phone had learned to interpret his love in bowls. He showed me one with chickpeas that looked like small planets. \"I think we should make this when they call,\" he said, and I nodded and cut slices of bread as if they were decisions I had simply to divide into equal parts.\n\nWhen a phone buzzes on a counter in a kitchen and your hands are full, you make a choice about whether to wipe them or answer anyway and grease the glass. My phone buzzed and I wiped my hands and picked it up, and there was a message from a number I had not saved because I believe in certain kinds of restraint. Tallulah, it said. How are you. It was a city\u2019s name followed by a question, and it came from somewhere I had decided to colonize as absence. My mother does not write well, which is to say she writes like someone who has learned all her words by memorizing labels. I stared at it the way a person stares at a mirror when the light goes wrong.\n\nI put the phone face down and did not tell my father, because I am the kind of daughter who likes to protect him from nothing. Then I picked it up again and wrote, Fine. Oviedo rains. The iron is still in it. She wrote back, I will visit. The words arranged themselves like furniture I had not ordered. I stood there with the bread knife in my hand and imagined the rooms shifting: a chair that had belonged to one life placed inside another, a kettle wanting to whistle loud enough to drown anything that might follow.\n\nYou should know that I did not answer, and that not answering is a kind of answer. I made chickpeas with my father and he took a picture of the pot and sent it to Alba\u2019s mother, who was still at work, and she responded with enthusiastic punctuation. We ate and washed up and he went to bed with the economy of motion of a man who has learned that if he stops too suddenly he will shatter, and I stood in the hallway between our rooms and Alba's and listened to a silence that had lost one heartbeat. Then I opened her door.\n\nI told myself that I wanted to open the window, that the air must be stale, that I would water the cactus if it looked thirsty, because I am very good at inventing good reasons to do things I have already decided to do for bad reasons. The room smelled like her shampoo and the paper covers of books and the ghost of hospital disinfectant she had brought home on her skin the last time she showered here. The cactus held its nerve and its thorns and seemed unsuitable for pigeons and saints. I went to the window and touched the glass and saw my face and the chimney that believes in itself. Then I turned and looked at the things that had been arranged as if the person who had arranged them had left for an intermission.\n\nHer desk had a stack of sketchbooks, and the top one lay open, as if to make the choice easier. There are violins and knives and other instruments designed for very specific motions; there are also hands, which can be used to bless or to steal. Mine did both that night. I held the breath inside my chest as if I could trade it later, and I put my fingers on the edge of the book and turned the page.\n\nThere were roofs, as promised: slates curved like shoulders under rain, a cathedral\u2019s spire not even pretending to be subtle, balconies like tongues, gutters like secrets. There were annotations, not in architecture's stiff letters but in a script that danced in its own shoes. \"This building wants to lean,\" she had written next to a sketch of a street whose name I knew by the way it tastes when you say it. \"The corner cannot decide whether to be generous.\" On another page she had drawn the lemon-yellow kettle and made it look like a locomotive, added tiny windows, given it passengers. Beneath it: \"We live inside our need to boil. Trains of tea. Warnings of steam.\"\n\nI told myself that I was allowed to see these things because they were beautiful and because beauty seeks eyes. Then I turned to another page and saw Carmen, tilted in a chair with one leg on the windowsill and the other challenging gravity to a duel, her shaved hair and blue hair both documented with a fondness I felt in my throat. Beneath it, a note: \"Carmen reads a room as if it were a play. I do not know if that is healing or manipulation. Perhaps both. She makes even hospital light feel like a choice.\" I put my hand on the paper and felt nothing but paper, but I had expected my skin to find heat. I turned another page and saw me.\n\nIt was not a likeness I would have recognized if my name had not been written in the corner, and even then I might have lied to myself. She had drawn me from the side, from the kitchen, pouring coffee with my elbow held out like a wing, and she had made my mouth softer than it is and my forehead more stubborn. The note beneath it said, \"T pours coffee as if she were offering it to a river. Her fingers are always on the verge of music. Count her mercies. Count her bluntness. Count her lists.\" I did not cry. I went to the window and opened it a fraction, which was what I had promised myself, and the city exhaled into the room as if glad to be let in.\n\nI closed the book because any more would have burned me. I sat on the bed with my hands palm-up as if waiting for coins. My bare hands had done it, and a door that should have stayed closed had become a path. You will tell me it is not as bad as blood or theft or betrayal, and you will be right and wrong. It was a small wrong, the kind you can carry in the pocket of a life until it wears a hole and drops through. I stood and straightened the pillowcases as if that were penance, and then I did the thing that would be less forgivable: I drew my name on the back page of the sketchbook, very small, very far down, a signature of a person who does not get to sign. I do not know what I was thinking. I think I was thinking, If it ever matters, she will see I was here. If it never matters, paper will keep its secrets.\n\nThe next day they called to say she could come home. We went in with coats and scarves and the lemons of the kettle in our eyes, and the nurse with the key tattoo pronounced us ready for the world. \"The world is less sterile,\" she said, grinning, \"but more interesting.\" Ana hugged Alba in the manner of someone who pretends not to be a hugger and then takes your air and your bones into her own momentarily. Nano wheeled the bed down the corridor for the theater of it and then stopped, and we put Alba's bag on her lap, and we rode the elevator where someone had scratched a heart into the metal and the cleaning crew could not erase it. Carmen appeared at the doors with a scarf around her neck that looked like a spilled galaxy and said, \"Be free, citizen,\" and bowed in a way that she can get away with. Alba put her hand on Carmen's hand in return, and my jealousy did its familiar, absurd motion in my chest, like a cat stretching.\n\nWhen we got home, the cactus looked surprised, and the kettle made its speech, and my father practiced being casual and failing. We made chickpeas and the soup of an ordinary day and Alba's mother arrived with bread that looked too handsome to eat and immediately tore it, which is what love does to handsome things. We ate and talked about nothing except what was everything\u2014sleep, appetite, the tree outside the hospital window that would now have to inspire someone else\u2014and after dinner my father put a record on because he is not a man to be obvious but he could not resist the possibility that music would make the world say yes. He chose the Thelonious Monk because he is that kind of romantic: he remembers one detail and repeats it until it is either embarrassing or tender. The needle fell, the crackle spoke like rain on paper, and the piano did what pianos do when they have forgiven the people in the room.\n\nWe did not dance. I have seen films and I know what should have happened, but we did not dance because the living room is small and because there were four of us and because joy is sometimes a thing you hold still to hear. Alba leaned back on the sofa with the blanket on her knees and closed her eyes the way you close your eyes when you are learning to trust your eyelids again. Alba's mother held my father's hand for a minute and then let go, and he smiled at something that did not require words. I sat on the floor and leaned my shoulder against the sofa, and Alba's hand slid from the blanket to my shoulder and rested there, warm, a weight that adjusted what gravity meant. She left it there through one song and then another, and I wrote five possible meanings for it in the air and chose none, because choice is a luxury that requires courage I did not have.\n\nLater, the parents went to bed in the embarrassed way of new lovers with children in the next rooms, and the flat shrank to a corridor and two doors and the soft machine of the refrigerator forgiving us our electricity. I stood on the balcony and watched the chimney do nothing with conviction. The street made its small promises to the cats. I heard Alba's door open and close and her feet on the tile, and then she was beside me, the blanket around her shoulders, her hair pulled into a sort of event.\n\n\"It smells like rust,\" she said, inhaling as if to prove the city's consistency.\n\n\"It prides itself on that,\" I said. \"Oviedo and its iron perfume.\"\n\n\"I missed our kettle,\" she said, because it is possible to miss objects the way you miss gestures. \"In the hospital, even the hot water tastes like waiting rooms.\"\n\n\"They should bottle that,\" I said. \"Eau de Patience.\"\n\n\"Smells like oranges and gel,\" she said, and then she laughed and coughed and laughed again. I put my hand out of the blanket's reach and caught the air like a clumsy net. \"Thank you,\" she said, and the words went to a place in me that has been waiting for them since I learned to hear.\n\n\"For what?\" I asked, and the question sat there pretending to be casual while it bought property in my heartbeat.\n\n\"For the lists,\" she said. \"For the way you read grammar as if it were poetry. For the oranges. For not letting me apologize for being afraid.\"\n\n\"You don't have to apologize,\" I said, and I meant it and it made nothing easier. She leaned her shoulder against mine and we stood like that, two pieces of scaffolding pretending to be a monument.\n\n\"Want to hear something ridiculous?\" she said, after a while, and ridiculous is a word that can hide pain's shadow when it wants to. \"In the hospital, I started designing a building with corridors like this, narrow enough that people cannot pass without touching on purpose. It's bad architecture. It's beautiful.\"\n\n\"It would get terrible reviews from the fire department,\" I said, and she smiled.\n\n\"My professor would send me back to basic drawing,\" she said. \"But I think buildings should force us to risk awkwardness if we want to get anywhere. Otherwise we avoid one another indefinitely and then die.\"\n\n\"We could call it the Department of Necessary Closeness,\" I said. \"Admission by list. Or oranges.\"\n\n\"Or both,\" she said, and she looked at me with those eyes like lakes that once were storms, and I felt the hinge of the future creak, loud enough to make even the pigeons startle. It is one thing to open a door and read someone's handwriting; it is another to find them opening the same door from the other side, not to catch you, but to join you in the threshold.\n\nWe did not kiss. I am sorry if you required that. It would be simpler if I had that to confess. We stood there on a balcony facing nearly nothing and invented a building that would punish our cowardice and reward our better qualities, and then she yawned and I told her to sleep and she made a face because she hates imperatives unless she issues them. She went to her room and I stood there until the kettle felt neglected and then I made myself tea and took it to bed and read three sentences of a book and understood none.\n\nIn the morning she slept late because her body was still the owner of itself in a way nobody negotiates with. I went to class and the professor attached himself to a speech about definite articles as if it were a life raft. Mara and I walked out into a drizzle that had chosen to be more felt than seen. \"You are lighter,\" she said, because she is rude and honest and because my face is a betrayal.\n\n\"She is home,\" I said. \"She touches my shoulder when Monk is playing. My mother texted me and I ignored her.\"\n\n\"So,\" Mara said, filing it in the part of her brain that shelves disasters and recipes. \"All your ships have arrived at once. Try not to let them collide.\"\n\n\"Do you want to meet Carmen?\" I asked, because I am a masochist in small, controlled ways.\n\n\"I think I already know Carmen,\" she said. \"We have a dozen of her at the theater. They eat light bulbs and then smile. But yes. Fine. Introduce me to the enemy.\"\n\n\"She is not the enemy,\" I said, automatic, reflexive, reflexively dishonest.\n\n\"Who is, then?\" she asked, and I almost said \"my mother\" and did not, because some words feel like intercoms: too loud, too public, even just between two people on the steps of a building that pretends to be a castle.\n\nThat afternoon we went to the old bookstore on Calle San Francisco because the rain decided to aim itself sideways and there are places in the city that understand how to be shelter without commentary. The bookstore still leaned into its own shadow, and the man behind the counter had the same face he has had since my childhood: a map of disapproval with a country of secret tenderness where nobody vacations. Alba moved through the aisles like a person testing a new pair of lungs; she touched spines as if to see whether each book had been taught to behave. I picked up a book of photographs of Lisbon, because she had brought the poster, and she laughed and said, \"No, not nostalgia. Research.\" We bought nothing because poverty loves us, but we held nearly everything and then put it back gently, as if we had borrowed an organ for a minute and had decided not to keep it.\n\nWhen we came out, the rain had changed its mind, because weather is allowed to do that. We walked toward the university, toward this version of ourselves that made sense in daylight, and we saw Carmen on the steps of the theater building, sitting with her legs folded up like a piece of furniture someone had assembled without instructions. She waved with two hands because that is who she is. \"Citizens!\" she called, because that is what she calls everyone when she wants to pretend we are in a play that has cast us badly. \"I was just thinking\u2014oh. Hi.\"\n\n\"This is Mara,\" I said, because I had decided to be brave in the direction of reality. \"She thinks you eat light bulbs.\"\n\n\"I do,\" Carmen said. \"They are crunchy and full of ideas. Nice to meet you, Tallulah's sensibly skeptical friend. Does she tell you everything? No, of course she doesn't. Nobody tells everything. That would be impolite in a narrative.\"\n\nMara raised an eyebrow that has frightened two men and a professor into reconsidering themselves. \"I prefer my narratives without narrators,\" she said, and Carmen clapped as if someone had performed acrobatics in a slow-motion movie. We stood there and performed kindness for one another and I tried to ignore how my skin had learned the topography of jealousy.\n\nWe walked home in a cluster that pretended to be casual and stopped to buy eggs that would go missing because eggs always go missing in families. In the flat, Alba went to her room to draw, Carmen sprawled on our sofa like a citizen of the Republic of Sprawl, Mara sat at the table and I made tea because I am always making tea when I am not breaking into rooms. Carmen quoted lines from the monologue about listening to cities and forgot where a period should go and did not care. Mara told a story about a boy who had finally learned to say his own name without apologizing for it. Alba came back with a page where she had drawn the three of us as buildings: Carmen with windows too big for any proper fa\u00e7ade, Mara with a door that looked deceptively plain and locks drawn in filigree, me with a staircase on the outside that invited people to climb and hid the fact that it did not go to the top.\n\n\"That's cruel,\" I said, but I was smiling, because I recognized the truth even when the ink tried to disguise it as art. We hung the page on the kitchen wall with a magnet shaped like a lemon and pretended it was a joke, and after Carmen went home and Mara performed a goodbye that included a double eye-roll and a secret smile for me alone, Alba and I sat in the clean quiet that follows people who leave and you still like.\n\n\"You went into my room,\" she said, and it would have been less terrifying if she had accused me of arson.\n\n\"I\u2014\" I began, because beginnings are harder than endings, and then I stopped pretending. \"Yes. I opened the window,\" I said, which was true and not sufficient, \"and I saw the kettle train.\" I could feel my pulse in my throat like a small angry bird. \"I read the line about my fingers. And Carmen.\"\n\nShe did not look angry. She looked like the tree outside the hospital window, uncomplicatedly itself under weather. She took a breath and let it out and did not use the breath to injure me. \"Okay,\" she said, and the word was a small bed I had not expected to be offered. \"You could have asked.\"\n\n\"I didn't know how,\" I said, my voice trying to be a person and nearly succeeding. \"I am not good at that door. I pretend to be. I open doors and then apologize to them.\"\n\n\"I noticed the signature,\" she said, and her mouth quirked like a page deciding whether to curl. \"Very clandestine. Very villain-in-training.\"\n\n\"I am sorry,\" I said. \"I am an idiot.\"\n\n\"You are,\" she agreed, which is one of the kindest things anybody can do. \"But you are not boring. And you opened the window. The cactus will write you a thank-you letter.\"\n\n\"Do you want me to not look again?\" I asked, which was me learning just now how to be a person who asks instead of takes.\n\n\"I want you to look when I invite you,\" she said. \"Which is now. Sit. I'll show you the bad building. You'll laugh. The stairs do nothing. Like hope. Like rules.\"\n\nWe sat on the floor with the sketchbook between us and our knees almost touching and drew lines on paper that tried to be straight and failed honestly, and I understood, for a moment, the architecture of restraint: you draw a room and then you draw a window that refuses to be door-shaped, and you admit that some openings are only for looking. We did that for an hour that lasted the right amount of time, and when the kettle whistled its train, we let it, and when the rain tapped, we let it, and when my phone buzzed with a number that would always be a city, I turned it face down again and told the part of me that is eleven years old and has excellent memory to wait a little longer.\n\nOn the weekend we took the list of tree streets and walked them like a pilgrimage for a childish religion, which is to say sincerely, with snacks. We named their leaves as if that could make them love us, and we paused under the plane trees in the square where the pigeons graduates go, and we watched a couple argue, first with hands and then with faces, and then with kisses issued like traffic fines. Alba tilted her head back and watched the canopy as if it were a ceiling fresco, and I watched her watching things I had seen too often to see again, and I thought, calmly and with no hope of remedy, that my map had changed and no amount of erasing would make the old roads reappear.\n\nThere were no dragons in the ceiling, though Nano would have obliged if asked. There were only days, doing their trick: passing and building, passing and building, uncertain which building they were making.Chapter 4 began like a rehearsal no one had agreed to attend, the kind where you show up in your normal clothes and someone presses a feathered hat into your hands and says, Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll know your lines when the lights go up. The city pretended at an early spring and failed charmingly; the air had the same iron shavings as always, but the light was a fraction wider, and the pigeons performed optimism with their chests out. In our flat the kettle staged its usual coup at eight, and the radio told us there would be traffic by the football stadium, and my father cleared his throat twice before he said, without looking at me, \u201cWe have the registry today. Twelve-thirty. You\u2019re coming?\u201d\n\nI said yes because what else does a person say when the state intends to stamp your family into a single object. On the balcony a shirt had been left overnight and collected the weather like gossip; I unpinned it and folded it and thought about paper that remembers where it has been creased. Alba came out of her room in a dress that could have been blue or black depending on the weather\u2019s opinion, and she put on shoes that made a sound like a polite argument on the tile. She was pale still, the hospital having taken a layer of bravado from her cheeks, but her eyes were the same, those careful lakes that pretend they have never flooded. She looked at me and tilted her head and said, \u201cWe should bring something. Lemons for luck?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have three,\u201d I said, opening the fruit bowl and counting the small planets of our domestic galaxy. \u201cThe registry will love that. They have a box for citrus, next to the box where they put your sighs.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d she said, and she slipped the lemons into her bag as if smuggling into a movie theater, which perhaps we were. Alba\u2019s mother came out in a scarf that asserted a position on green, and my father put on a jacket that used to belong to his hope. The four of us walked to the registry office because it is close enough to make walking feel like a moral position. The woman with the pigeons nodded at us as if we were a procession that had finally learned its steps. The buses coughed their white flags and moved on.\n\nThe registry office had decided to be cheerful by means of ferns that were barely alive and chairs that stacked into good intentions. The walls were the beige of paper you don\u2019t choose. There was a bouquet on the counter that had been given up by its first recipient and adopted by the State. The clerk had a face that made you want to remember your own name. \u201cNext,\u201d she said, as if this were a continuation and not a beginning, and my father produced documents that contained all his careful mistakes. He and Alba\u2019s mother signed with an ink that pretended to be permanent. The clerk stamped with the gravity of rain. When she pushed the paper back through the slot, something in the room exhaled.\n\n\u201cCongratulations,\u201d she said, without looking up, and there it was, the word that refuses to examine its own assumptions. We smiled and performed the ritual kissing of cheeks and avoided knocking over a fern. A little boy in a sweater shaped like a dinosaur roared so convincingly that the old man beside him smiled despite himself. Alba put one of the lemons on the windowsill and then, when the clerk frowned, removed it and put it back in her bag, whispering to it, \u201cSorry, bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nOn the street again, parcels of sunlight laid themselves on people\u2019s shoulders as if to mark them for delivery to a better place, and the cathedral pretended it had never been a hiding place for prayers that went unheard. My phone vibrated against my ribs like a trapped bee, and I let it because I am the kind of person who believes a beep can be negotiated with. Alba\u2019s mother broke away to call her sister, the one who collects recipes like trophies, and my father looked at the paper as if it might speak in my mother\u2019s voice and say anything that would make the past a different country. Alba and I walked half a step behind them, the lemons heavy with their unspent miracles, and she said, in the tone of someone remarking on architecture, \u201cSo. Steps. Stepping. Step.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t love the word,\u201d I said. \u201cIt makes it sound like we\u2019re always one off.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are,\u201d she said, and for a second neither of us pretended otherwise.\n\nWe celebrated the way poor saints do: with coffee and a pastry we cut into careful quarters at a caf\u00e9 that never changes the brand of sugar packets. My father took a photograph of our cups as if to post proof that warmth had happened. Alba\u2019s mother asked me if I would come to dinner at her sister\u2019s on Sunday and I said yes before my throat could stage a rebellion. The radio in the caf\u00e9 was playing a song that had been trapped in the walls since the nineties and had finally gnawed its way out. Alba leaned across the table and brushed a crumb off my sleeve and I thought about how small mercies are never small to bodies that need any.\n\nAfter coffee I walked her to the School of Architecture because she had a pin-up, a small critique for a small project with a professor who enjoys being the kind of kind that hurts a little. \u201cDon\u2019t stay,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll get bored, and then you\u2019ll write a paper in your head about how critique is just a dialect of cruelty, and then you\u2019ll be mad at yourself for being right.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a connoisseur of being right at the wrong time,\u201d I said, and stayed anyway, because sometimes boredom is a kind of worship. The studio was a white room that had given up on warmth and settled for the religion of light. Students pinned their pages to the cork wall with the solemnity of people who aren\u2019t sure whether they\u2019re offering their work up for sacrifice or marriage. Alba\u2019s page had the building we\u2019d half-joked into existence: the narrow corridors that refused to let strangers pass as strangers, the stairs that went elsewhere on purpose, the rooms that asked questions on their thresholds. She had drawn small people in pencil, and one of them looked suspiciously like me, hands held out as if to measure a doorway\u2019s intentions.\n\nThe professor, a woman with hair like a storm cloud that had earned its electricity, stood back and squinted at the plan. \u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible,\u201d she said, and my ribs prepared to defend someone who did not need me as a shield. \u201cAnd brave. It has the arrogance of youth and the humility of a person who actually looks at how people touch. Your corridors will terrify fire inspectors and make families confess things. I\u2019m not sure which scares me more. How would you ventilate the middle?\u201d\n\n\u201cSkylights,\u201d Alba said, not blinking. \u201cCourtyards that are excuses for trees. If you force nearness, you must remove heat.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d the professor said. \u201cAnd your stairs that go nowhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cPractice,\u201d Alba said. \u201cFor all the ways we go nowhere on purpose before we go somewhere we can bear. Let them exist. People will sit on them. They will talk to people they would have avoided.\u201d\n\nThe professor smiled the way clouds sometimes part just enough to prove the sun still knows the choreography. \u201cYou are intolerable,\u201d she said, and pinned a small yellow sticky note on the page that said, in a quick hand, Keep this wrongness. Use it well. The other students pretended not to be taking notes on courage. I stood in the back, learning nothing about syntax and everything about desire pretending to be theory, and when Alba\u2019s eyes found mine, I did not hide how proud I was in case I would need that visibility later as currency.\n\nOutside the studio, Alba let out a breath she had been saving since morning. \u201cI thought she would set it on fire,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cShe did,\u201d I said. \u201cNow it\u2019s yours and brighter.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome with me to the theater,\u201d she said, and the shift made sense in her mouth; she had moved from rooms where walls speak to rooms where voices pretend to be walls. \u201cCarmen has a rehearsal. They\u2019re using hospital curtains as a set. She wants to show me how not to be solemn about illness.\u201d\n\nWe went because afternoons are for infidelity to whatever you said you would do at noon. The theater building smelled like old wood and new sweat. Carmen met us in the lobby wearing a sweater the color of a bruise you can\u2019t explain easily, and she spun once in the middle of the floor because bodies like hers cannot stay still when they have been given an audience. \u201cCitizens,\u201d she said, and then, because she had noticed the paper under Alba\u2019s arm, \u201cAh, the House of Necessary Closeness. Bring it to my monologues. We will let the chairs be cruel, so the words can be kind.\u201d\n\nThey rehearsed on a stage framed by curtains that did look like the hospital\u2019s, pale green that believes it is calming and is often a lie. The director had the voice of a person who has misplaced sleep and refuses to file a missing persons report. Carmen read a scene where her character asks a nurse whether her heart is a prop or the real thing, and the nurse says, You are the only one who can tell by the way you fall, and it wasn\u2019t good theater yet, but it was honest rehearsal. Alba watched with her hand over her mouth, an instinct I recognized from the hospital when she had hidden laughter from a fever. I stood in the dark with my arms crossed like a parenthesis that did not know what it contained.\n\nOn the bus home my phone buzzed again with my mother\u2019s city pressed into the digits. This time she did not ask a question; she announced herself as if she were luggage: I have tickets. Friday. I will be in Oviedo at four. Please. I read it twice to make sure the word please belonged to her and not to my invention. I did not answer. I could feel the answer inside my mouth, a coin that had lost its country. When we climbed the stairs, the building\u2019s handrail cool and indifferent under my palm, I told my father because lying would have required a speech I had not rehearsed. He put his hand on the counter, flat, as if feeling for tremors, and said the words he uses when the freezer argues with him: \u201cOkay. We will deal with that when it arrives.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want me to tell her not to come?\u201d I asked, and hated how the word want made his face briefly blank, a screen waiting for the wrong film.\n\n\u201cI want you to be less alone,\u201d he said, softly, and I had to leave the room to stop him having to see my face turn into evidence.\n\nThe day of the arrival built itself like scaffolding that shrieks when you put too much weight on one side. I went to classes and learned how Spanish absorbs blame into passive constructions with a disingenuous shrug. Alba sent me a picture of a courtyard she had found behind a caf\u00e9, a rectangle of mild light with a potted orange tree pretending to be necessary, and I sent her back a picture of the staircase in the humanities building where someone had taped an apology to the wall for no obvious reason: Perdonen el polvo de las obras, a phrase that always makes me think of the dust we cannot see. At lunch, Mara tucked her legs under her on the bench and listened to me read my mother\u2019s message with the flat affect of a person tasting a medicine before deciding whether to take it.\n\n\u201cDo you have a plan?\u201d she asked, tearing her sandwich into democratic pieces.\n\n\u201cThe opposite,\u201d I said. \u201cI have impulses. Fleeing. Hiding. Standing in a doorway and drafting a treaty.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t get a treaty,\u201d Mara said, not unkindly. \u201cShe gets a map. With warning signs. You make them big and legible. You can draw, can\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can list,\u201d I said. \u201cMaps of lists. Lists that map. Items like landmarks: the bookstore that leaned when you left, the kettle that refused to stop, the fact of me being eleven and learning that absence can sit at a table and eat bread with you and not choke.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cTell her you\u2019ll meet her somewhere that is not your kitchen. Make the first conversation belong to the street. Keep it moving. Don\u2019t ask questions you\u2019re not ready to absorb.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsorb is a cruel verb,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cIt is also a function,\u201d she said, and kissed my forehead like an older sister I never had, which made me want to both cry and salt the earth of the cafeteria.\n\nI texted my mother an hour before the train would get in and told her to meet me by the statue of the man who pretends the city is his. I used words that weighed less than my heart wanted them to. The train arrived. The station breathed its tired metal breath. The plaza around the statue had decided to be a stage for umbrellas. I stood there and put my hands in my pockets and took them out and put them back in and thought about the difference between mercy and method. When she appeared, she was both the same and wrong. The haircut that had been her only indulgence had grown out; the coat that had signaled her belief in big cities had resigned itself to our smaller one; the face that used to move like weather had learned to hold a shape and keep it.\n\n\u201cT,\u201d she said, and I had prepared for the wrong voice. It was lower, or maybe my memory had been too high-pitched. She did not reach for me, and I was grateful. We stood in a greeting that could have been mistaken for waiting for the light to change. \u201cYou look like your father,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd like yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look like Madrid,\u201d I said, because insult and compliment have always flirted in our mouths. We began to walk because walking gives you the alibi of traffic. She told me about a temp job that expected her to be grateful for time; I told her about linguistics as if it were the study of excuses; she nodded as if I had offered her soup. We paused under the awning of a bar where chalk letters promised a calamari that would forgive your life; she smiled at the sign and said, \u201cAsturias,\u201d like a tourist who had had her throat cleared by nostalgia.\n\nWe did not mention leaving. We did not mention eleven. We did not mention the city she had avoided in her mouth. I told her about my father\u2019s registry office and she said, \u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d and I believed her a fraction. She asked after my work in the tone of someone asking the weather about its plans for Friday, and then, as we approached the cathedral, she said, \u201cCan I\u2014can I see where you live?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, not loudly, not cruelly. \u201cNot yet.\u201d It took both of us a second to reassemble our faces. She nodded. The square noticed the rain decide to fall like a sentence that had been held back too long. \u201cAnother time,\u201d she said. \u201cA coffee then? Inside? You look cold.\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t, but I wanted to be somewhere that had walls that did not know my father\u2019s name. We went into a caf\u00e9 that likes to be dim even at noon. The waitress had forearms that could carry three tables and the kind of joke that nurses tell at three a.m. We sat at a small table near the window and watched umbrellas fail at being boats. We had coffee. We spoke of how the trains lately had begun to act like moody relatives. She asked, too carefully, \u201cDo you need anything?\u201d and I almost laughed, because the list unfurled across my brain like a dropped ribbon that knows how to tie itself. I said no. She asked about music as if I still held onto the version of me that tried to learn Monk by osmosis; I said there was a record player now and resisted the urge to talk about crescents drawn on labels. She said, \u201cI can stay a few days,\u201d and I said, \u201cOkay,\u201d as if okay were a country with immigration control.\n\nWhen we parted, she touched my sleeve, not to hold me, but as if to check whether I was in focus. \u201cI\u2019ll text you,\u201d she said, and I did not tell her not to. I walked home with the city pretending to be a map and my legs pretending to be sure of the route. The flat was full of the smell of onions turning polite in oil. My father was chopping parsley with the concentration of a man who would do anything to replace one image in his mind with another. Alba\u2019s mother kissed my forehead and called me valiente like a word she would argue with if she had the time, and Alba turned from the stove with the wooden spoon like a wand and said, \u201cWell?\u201d with her eyebrows.\n\nI told the story without adjectives and they nodded in the way people do when they have agreed not to make new weather. After dinner, when the parents went to bed in their soft, embarrassed way, Alba and I sat at the kitchen table with the sketchbook between us like a treaty that made art of its clauses. She drew a corridor that got wider and then narrowed again, an apology and a dare. \u201cYour mother,\u201d she said, not a question.\n\n\u201cShe arrived,\u201d I said. \u201cShe knows how to wear the word please now. We weren\u2019t unkind. We weren\u2019t anything brave, either.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were a person,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s hard enough.\u201d She shaded a stair so it looked like the beginning of a secret. \u201cWill she come here?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cNot yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want her to?\u201d she asked, and I thought about the kettle, about my father\u2019s jacket, about the lemon magnet holding up the drawing of the three buildings we pretended to be. I thought about Carmen\u2019s stage and the hospital curtains and the boy\u2019s ship, and I said, \u201cI want a world where the answer to that is simple.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can build corridors that force kindness,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the doors still decide who they let in.\u201d She closed the sketchbook and put her palm on it as if stopping a small animal from running into traffic. \u201cLet\u2019s be stupid and go to that jam on Wednesday. You can pretend to love Monk again, and I will admit that I like him more than I thought.\u201d\n\nThe jam on Wednesday was like every jam on Wednesday except when it wasn\u2019t. The bar\u2019s wood had absorbed decades of spilled courage; the lampshades were still the color of nicotine and forgiveness. A trumpet player in a jacket that had seen too many winters found a note that made one of the bottles on the shelf hum in sympathy. Alba sipped her ginger ale like a counsel who didn\u2019t want to weaken her case. Carmen breezed in half an hour late with a scarf that had decided it was a comet, and she pulled a chair with the confidence of a person who can make furniture forgive her. \u201cI could have used your corridors today,\u201d she said to Alba. \u201cSomebody cried in the dressing room and then we all pretended not to notice for eight minutes and then we noticed for eight minutes too long.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow was the nurse line?\u201d I asked, because I had liked it at rehearsal against my will.\n\n\u201cI delivered it as if I believed in it and nobody laughed at the wrong place,\u201d she said. \u201cProgress. Mara is here.\u201d She waved at the door, where Mara stood with an expression that said, of course, there will be jazz now. They collided in hellos that managed to be sincere and slightly competitive, and I sat there and let the music arrange my breathing into new shapes.\n\nTo prove that I can surprise myself, I stood when the pianist looked around the room like a man in search of a dare, and I went to the small stage with the microphone that had never liked me. My hands were cold with the knowledge of where they have been and where they wanted to be, and my mouth wanted to bargain, but I said the poem I had not meant to say, the one about iron rain and bus brakes and pigeons that know the hours of the human soul, and it did not sound like Monk because I am not a piano, but it was honest in the way that leaves are honest when they fall. Alba\u2019s face did not move into that expression people wear when they are proud and want credit for it; she looked at me as if this had always been an option I had forgotten to exercise. Carmen put a hand to her heart in exaggerated gratitude. Mara raised her glass and did not make it a joke.\n\nWhen we got home, the stairwell smelled like somebody had cooked something with too much garlic and no apologies, which felt like a blessing. In the kitchen, the light over the stove flickered in the way that suggests it is practicing dying, and I stood on the counter to unscrew the bulb and because I wanted to prove my usefulness to gravity. \u201cDon\u2019t fall,\u201d Alba said, in the tone of a general who has learned to issue orders in the form of kindness. I didn\u2019t. We drank a tea too late for sleep and stood by the window and watched the night perform itself correctly. My phone vibrated again and I let it because my hands were busy with a mug and because I had promised myself not to be the person who always answers the person who always left.\n\nMy mother wrote, The city is beautiful at night. She wrote, I walked past your school. She wrote, I am sorry in the way that does not ask to be believed, only to be heard. I put the phone down and did not look at Alba, and she spared me by looking at the kettle as if it were a god we didn\u2019t believe in but sacrificed to anyway.\n\nThursday turned itself into a performance of being fine. I went to class and argued with a boy who said that words do not mean until someone wills them to; I told him that words carry past owners in their seams, and he said yes as if I had just announced that chairs remember thighs. Alba spent the morning in the studio building a model out of cardboard that complained; her hands came home with glue on them like small bandages. Carmen texted a picture of the hospital curtain under stage lights and it did look like it had something to confess. My father worked late because happiness makes him shy and work does not, and Alba\u2019s mother made soup that tasted like a decision.\n\nFriday arrived with the self-importance of a person who believes in calendars. My mother asked to meet again; I said okay because no one has ever died of okay, which is a lie, but one I told myself for sport. We walked by the river that pretends to be serious and isn\u2019t, and she told me about a friend who had become ill and recovered, and I told her about Alba\u2019s hospital and how the windows that face parking lots can still contain trees. She did not ask about Alba in the way that would have forced me to draw a map; she asked like a person who remembers that step-sister is a word you wear until it either fits or tears you. When we came to the bridge that thinks it is an eyebrow, she stopped and looked downstream and said, \u201cI should have stayed,\u201d and for a second I saw her at our kitchen table with the lemon magnet and the kettle pretending to be a locomotive, and I was angry because a sentence can be true and arrive too late to save anyone.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d I said, and the words were not a slap, but they knew where her face was. She nodded. We turned back toward the station because promises to ourselves are important even when they are about leaving. We said goodbye without arrangements; she touched the sleeve of my coat again and it did not feel like a claim. In the afternoon I put my head down on my desk and let the wood tell me its version of events. The cactus on the sill had produced a bud so small it could have been a trick of the light.\n\nThat night the power went out for the whole block with the drama of an opera that had been waiting for its cue. The refrigerator sighed and stopped pretending it was necessary; the record player went still; the kettle, bless it, kept its godhood because gas doesn\u2019t bow to electricity. We lit the candles that people who don\u2019t believe in romance keep for blackouts, and the flat rearranged itself into a ship with rooms that glowed like small ports. My father did that thing where men bang the fuse box with a friendly fist; Alba\u2019s mother distributed blankets like medals. Alba and I sat on the floor with the sketchbook open to a page where she had drawn stairs that admitted defeat gracefully. In the dark the pencil made a sound like a moth on a window.\n\n\u201cTell me something true you haven\u2019t said out loud,\u201d she said, and the request landed like a gentle trauma. The candlelight performed its cruelty on our faces, revealing softnesses we had been hoarding.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I know the difference between wanting to be held and wanting to be seen,\u201d I said, and the sentence surprised me by being already formed when it left my mouth. She nodded as if this had been on her list of things about me that felt inevitable. The kettle chose that moment to sing, and we laughed in self-defense at the ways that drama chooses its cues.\n\n\u201cYour turn,\u201d I said, because fairness is one of my least fraudulent virtues.\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d she said, and shifted her shoulder against the cabinet, \u201cthat I came here to build rooms and found myself trying to build a person I could be in them. Le\u00f3n was a place where I was good at stairs. Oviedo is a place where I am practicing doors.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd?\u201d I said, because the candle had decided to burn like a witness.\n\n\u201cAnd I want you,\u201d she said, with that terrible generosity of leaving you to decide what the sentence means, \u201cin my buildings. In the ones that force kindness. On the stairs that are for sitting. In the rooms that only have windows, so we are forced to look.\u201d\n\nI did not kiss her. The power had gone out, but not my good sense or my fear. I put my hand flat on the sketchbook and felt the paper thin my pulse out into the room, and I said, \u201cI am here,\u201d which is a sentence that can hold more than it appears to. She put her hand over mine for the length of a candle\u2019s wobble and then took it away, not because she wanted to, but because we both were still the kind of people who believed in being able to sleep.\n\nThe power came back with a shrug and the refrigerator rejoiced in its whirr and the record player blinked its small light and pretended it had never been dead. We put a record on and it crackled back to itself and Monk played something that made the room decide to exhale, and my father came into the kitchen to say that the block had cheered at the sound of the football game returning to its screen next door, and Alba\u2019s mother smiled into her soup like a person who has finally registered her own victory. Later, in bed, I allowed my body to be tired and not just dramatic, and I dreamt that the cactus burst into flowers and that the pigeons delivered invitations in their beaks to a building with no doors at all.\n\nOn Sunday I went to Alba\u2019s aunt\u2019s apartment where there were nineteen people in a space meant for ten and everyone had decided to shout love at one another in two dialects. They served fabada that stood up for itself in the bowl; they insisted I eat as if they had sponsored my mouth. Alba\u2019s mother told the story of the registry and made it funnier than it had been because she can make forms into jokes; my father laughed the way men laugh when they have been forgiven and don\u2019t trust it yet. Alba\u2019s cousins asked me whether linguistics can make a person stop lying and I said no, only better at it. We went home with containers full of soup like luggage for the week, and the lemon magnet held up a new drawing of a window that had decided it was a question.\n\nFor a few days, the city pretended it had been easy all along. Classes behaved like themselves, which is to say inconsistent. The hospital receded into a story we could tell people when they needed proof that we had done winter properly. Carmen had her opening night and we sat in the eighth row and watched her wrestle with sentences the way you wrestle with a wet sheet, and she won more often than she lost, and afterward in the bar she told us that acting is just the art of being a person when too many people are watching. Mara rolled her eyes and bought her a beer. My mother texted me a picture from the train window of a field that had decided to be blank, and said, I will write, and I believed that the way you believe a liar when you want the night off from caution.\n\nLate in the week, I went to the bookstore on Calle San Francisco alone because the rain had decided to be made of needles and I wanted a shadow to lean into. The man behind the counter looked up as if expecting me to carry a catastrophe and was mildly disappointed that I had only brought dampness. I wandered the aisles and let the books breathe on me. In the corner where poetry pretends to be patient, I found a slim volume about doors in old cities, their measurements and myths, the thresholds where brides tripped and wolves chose not to enter, and there was a chapter on hinges that made me feel like someone had been eavesdropping on my private metaphors. I did not buy it because money is a language I do not speak fluently this month; I stood and read instead until the man behind the counter coughed in a way that suggested I should practice leaving.\n\nWhen I came out, the woman with the pigeons had taken shelter under the awning and the pigeons milled like guilty confessions at a public hearing. She nodded at me and said, \u201cThey follow food and weather, like anyone,\u201d and I nodded back as if she had granted me a doctorate in practical philosophy. At home, Alba was on the floor with the model, convincing a small wall to behave with a strip of tape. She looked up and the look landed on me as if I had walked into a sentence that had been waiting for me to finish it.\n\n\u201cWe need more glue,\u201d she said, pragmatic as oxygen. \u201cAnd a better fire plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe always need a better fire plan,\u201d I said, and then I sat down cross-legged on the floor and took the tape when she offered it and held the tiny corridor while she pressed it into obedience. The kettle announced time and we let it. The records had started to warp at the edges because we are not careful enough with heat; the Monk still played perfectly, as if certain wrongnesses are built to endure. When the phone rang later, it was not my mother and not a hospital and not any of the disasters I rehearse. It was a number I did not know that turned out to be the program coordinator for a small reading at the university caf\u00e9, asking if I would come and read the iron rain poem because someone had told her I had a mouth that could make buses sound like whales. I said yes because sometimes you say yes to something that is not the thing you want most in order to remember how yes feels.\n\nAnd on Friday, because weeks do not run out of ways to invent themselves, we were on the balcony in a drizzle that was more opinion than weather, and Alba said, \u201cDo you ever feel like a hinge?\u201d and I said, \u201cYes,\u201d and she said, \u201cGood. Then it\u2019s not just me,\u201d and the two of us stood there and moved nothing and held everything together for another day.Chapter 6 began like a door that had been painted shut and was suddenly asked to remember its purpose. The city woke under a glaze that wasn\u2019t rain so much as breath returned to glass, and the chimneys stood like exclamation points nobody had earned. In our flat the kettle tried to startle the morning into good behavior and the record player sat with its lid up as if listening for instructions. My father hummed a tune from a decade that never quite belonged to him and put his jacket on the chair in case he decided to leave, which is how he prepares for any day that might ask him to be different. Alba was already at the table with a pencil behind her ear and the model of the Building of Necessary Closeness half-assembled, its cardboard corridors arguing softly with the tape. She had made a tiny sign for the stair to nowhere that said, in letters you could only read if you were already in love with the idea, practice.\n\nShe looked up when I came in with the sleep still folded into my eyes and said, \u201cHow do you feel about microphones?\u201d The pencil fell forward from her ear like a decision.\n\n\u201cLike I feel about umbrellas,\u201d I said, reaching for the kettle and finding it too hot to touch. \u201cUseful, deceitful. They fail exactly when the weather is most itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said, and her smile had that slant it has when she knows she\u2019s being kind to my panic by pretending to joke with it. \u201cThe caf\u00e9 has one that was found in a broom closet and rescued. Carmen says it works like a dog with an opinion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can project,\u201d I said, more bravely than I felt. \u201cThe problem is not air. The problem is the ownership of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou read like you pour coffee,\u201d she said, and she wasn\u2019t teasing. \u201cAs if the river had been waiting to be invited into a cup. I\u2019ll be there. You can glare at me if the words try to leave the stage without permission.\u201d\n\nI thought about the poem I\u2019d said I would read and the one that had been busy building itself behind it, using bits of my day like scaffolding. The iron of the rain had chosen me as a faithful correspondent; the pigeons had become a chorus with a sense of humor; the corridors wanted to be a metaphor and a floor plan simultaneously. I buttered bread with the care of a novice surgeon, because breakfast is sometimes just a rehearsal for public acts. Alba cut an orange into eight precise segments and declared them tickets, and we ate them as if there would be a door somewhere later that would require proof of our citrus.\n\nThe university caf\u00e9 had taped the poster with my name spelled correctly and the month mislabeled, as if someone had negotiated with time and lost the small print. The window chalk announced happy hour for a coffee that could not remember its own smile. Inside, the chairs were pretending to be attentive and the lampshades hung at a degree that made me feel like I was already on stage. Carmen arrived too early with a scarf that had decided to be a dare and said, \u201cYou will be fine, and if not, I will stage a diversion by climbing onto a table and reciting the safety instructions from an airplane,\u201d which, terrifyingly, she would. Mara came with a notebook and a pen and the calm of a person who has volunteered to be my witness whether I fall or fly. My father texted a picture of a teacup from his desk as if to bless the event long-distance, and Alba\u2019s mother promised soup later as if broth were a language we all shared no matter what else we couldn\u2019t say.\n\nAn hour before the reading my phone pulsed with a message that landed like a hand laid too gently on my shoulder. I\u2019ll come if I may, my mother wrote, and there was a mercy in the conditional that I could not afford to examine for too long. I typed back a single word that is both door and barrier\u2014okay\u2014and felt it lodge in the architecture of my throat. I did not tell my father because I am good at triage when it concerns information; I told Alba and she touched her eyebrow the way she does when she\u2019s measuring a wall and said, \u201cWe will sit where we can see you and the exit,\u201d and I almost laughed from the relief of someone who understands how to design for floods.\n\nThe program began with a boy who announced he was \u201cmore into prose poetry actually,\u201d which meant he read a paragraph about the sea and a cinnamon roll as if they had broken up with him over the phone. A woman with a voice like rain on tin took the microphone and made it behave, and the room turned the volume of its breathing down to polite. Then the coordinator said my name and my name, when said into a microphone, felt like a word being asked whether it enjoys its own weather. I stood and the chair gave up the idea of me with a squeak that sounded like a hinge. Alba\u2019s eyes were where I needed them: steady, just to the left of the mic, a small lake that had decided to reflect only the necessary light. Carmen folded herself into enthusiasm beside her; Mara uncapped her pen and looked at me the way you look at a person who is about to cross a narrow bridge with their eyes open.\n\nI read the poem about iron and rain and the way buses inhale before they exhale us back into our weather, and people did the thing I had secretly hoped for and had pretended not to hope for: they leaned. The caf\u00e9\u2019s clatter consented to a half-minute of silence exactly when I described the woman who feeds pigeons as if they were a committee, and someone in the back made a sound that might have been an agreement. The microphone hummed once like a reluctant appliance and then decided to be good. I let the next poem arrive with its own feet; it had the corridors of Alba\u2019s building in it and the injunction against passing without touch, and it had a stair that stopped to invite conversation, and it had a door that had been painted shut, asked to remember, reminded gently that remembering is sometimes just not resisting. I said the word please and let it belong to both me and the person who had texted it. I did not look at the back of the room until that word had done its work.\n\nMy mother had chosen a place by the window where the glass collected the outside in pieces and tried to assemble a coherent weather. She was smaller than she had been two years ago, or my memory had inflated her to the size of her leaving. She leaned forward the way people do in caf\u00e9s when they are trying to remember how to belong, and when she saw me see her she did not smile so much as let the possibility of smile hover in the vicinity of her mouth. I kept reading because stopping would have been a betrayal of the air the room had already exchanged with me. I made my voice do the thing Alba had accused it of: being a blanket, being a talking handrail, being the particular kindness of a bridge.\n\nThe microphone chose the last line to go on strike and I finished without it, finding out that my ribs can be a drum if I ask them nicely. The applause landed like rain on paper and did not tear it. People came to tell me what my words had reminded them of, which is the ritual we perform to let the poet believe in the usefulness of their particular noise. Alba didn\u2019t come forward right away; she held her position at the edge, as if guarding the door that leads from one version of me to the next. Carmen hugged me with the generosity of a person who considers accolade a communal resource. Mara said, \u201cYou did not disgrace any trains,\u201d which, coming from her, is thunderous praise.\n\nMy mother did not approach until the wave had receded and I had put the microphone back in its stand as if returning a loaned instrument. She stood beside a table with a bowl of lemons that had no right to be there in a caf\u00e9, just as we had brought them to the registry office as if to annotate bureaucracy. \u201cT,\u201d she said, quietly, and I wondered briefly whether she had practiced the letter aloud in the train window to see if it still fit her mouth.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d I said, and when I did not drown, I thought about how sometimes survival is simply a matter of where you put your feet. We walked to a corner that had room for two people to be awkward without causing a structural failure. She said the poems had made her want to phone a city and apologize to it, which is exactly the kind of thing she would say when she wanted me to know she had been listening even if she did not know what to do with the information.\n\n\u201cThank you for coming,\u201d I said, because I have learned to hand out polite phrases as if they were life vests. \u201cI\u2019m meeting my family for dinner. We can\u2014tomorrow\u2014coffee somewhere that isn\u2019t a kitchen.\u201d\n\nShe nodded and didn\u2019t do the thing she might have done, which is to ask to bend that rule. \u201cI\u2019m staying near the station,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a caf\u00e9 that pretends to be Paris. Eleven?\u201d\n\n\u201cEleven,\u201d I said, and her face moved into gratitude so quickly it startled me into forgiving the word for all its losses. She didn\u2019t touch my arm this time, which made it easier to keep all my bones where they belonged. When she left, she did it like a person leaving a church quietly, borrowing the silence that wasn\u2019t hers and promising to return it.\n\nAt dinner my father poured soup as if accuracy were a second language he had recently decided to master. Alba\u2019s mother over-salted and then added a peeled potato the way her own mother had taught her, remedying and remembering in the same motion. Alba sat opposite me and made a circle in her bowl with the back of her spoon as if beginning a sketch in broth. We talked about the reading using only nouns and the jokes that live near nouns; we did not say mother, which felt like both a mercy and a cowardice. After, my father washed each bowl as if returning it to a calmer version of itself and went to his room with the deliberate gait of a man who will wait by a phone until sleep kills the lights.\n\nAlba and I took our tea to the balcony because the air had chosen to be honest about its chill. Below us a cat claimed a stretch of curb with the right born of repetition, and above us the chimney measured time with the absence of smoke. \u201cYou did that,\u201d she said, and I pretended not to know whether she meant the reading or the act of surviving my mother\u2019s presence. \u201cYou put verbs on things that thought they were nouns, and they didn\u2019t even get offended.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was less afraid when the microphone died,\u201d I said. \u201cWhich seems like a metaphor with ambitions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe always liked candles in blackouts,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy should this be different? Also, you pronounced se with more tenderness than is strictly necessary. Your professor would be charmed into correcting you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait until he hears my ode to the passive,\u201d I said, and she laughed quietly, a sound that has learned the difference between making light and being it. We stood without speaking for a minute that widened like a door that had finally remembered its hinges. She reached up to tuck hair behind her ear and her knuckles brushed my sleeve, and it felt like a bird landing on a branch it has been pretending not to look at. We let the moment sit between us on our balcony that faced almost nothing and we refused to name it because our names had been doing heavy labor all week.\n\nThe next morning I went to meet my mother at the caf\u00e9 that pretended to be Paris. The tables were mean to elbows and the croissants were ambitious without being arrogant. She wore the same coat as Friday, which meant she had decided not to spend on appearances what she might need for absences. We spoke like people who know how to keep a conversation from turning into a trap. She told me about a book club that had saved her from an apartment that made silence loud; I told her about a list of streets with trees and how the hospital window had hosted a leaf that insisted on a season. When she asked if I was happy, I told her the truth\u2019s cousin: that I had become more precise about what happiness is not.\n\nShe asked, as if asking to borrow sugar, if she might see me again before she went back, and I said yes on the condition of public benches and caf\u00e9s and the city as witness. She accepted the terms and did not pretend they weren\u2019t terms, which made it possible for me to keep breathing on a weekday. We parted with a handshake that both of us permitted to be a little absurd. The woman with the pigeons nodded at me as if to say, yes, today is a day you stood in the weather and did not invent new weather to replace it.\n\nBack home, the cactus had finally decided to be dramatic according to its own schedule. A bud had opened into a tentative white that looked like a small confession, and it did it in daylight to surprise us. Alba crouched to look at it closely, her hair falling forward like a curtain someone had decided not to shut all the way. \u201cThey do this once and then never again or once a year and pretend it costs them nothing,\u201d she said, and she did not touch the flower, which made me love her with a ferocity I hid by rearranging lemons.\n\nWe took the model to the studio for a review and watched it survive the elevator like a brave patient. The professor with storm-cloud hair came by and flicked a stair with her finger to see if it would admit its uselessness. \u201cYou still want to force people to brush past each other,\u201d she said, \u201cin a culture that prefers to pretend the walls are benevolent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to design for what we fear,\u201d Alba said, and the professor smiled in that way that meant she had been waiting for that answer and would not punish its predictability. \u201cI added a courtyard for air. I will affix small trees that will fall off if the glue refuses to believe in me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake the trees convincing enough that the fire inspector breathes differently,\u201d the professor said, and pinned a note onto the board: Don\u2019t apologize to the walls. After the review, Alba and I walked to the theater because Carmen had asked for arms to carry a prop wardrobe that had started to think it was a character. We found her arguing lovingly with a bolt of fabric, her hair a half-blue weather report. \u201cYou were good,\u201d she said to me, without overture, which told me someone had been in that caf\u00e9 who later told someone who later told her. \u201cYou made the room a corridor, and people touched, even if only with their faces.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou steal metaphors for breakfast,\u201d Mara said, appearing with a cup that announced a loyalty to bitter coffee. \u201cAlso, your curtain needs washing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like a curtain that looks like it remembers the last body that passed it,\u201d Carmen said, and they resumed their rivalry for the sovereignty of sentences. I let their talk move over me like a stage light and helped carry the wardrobe that had decided it wanted to know what the sun is.\n\nThat evening, the university caf\u00e9 messaged to ask if I might read again next month, this time with a theme that pretended to be about cities but was actually about being honest when the world is listening and you\u2019d prefer it looked away. I said yes without asking permission of my fear and then told it anyway, and it sulked briefly and then agreed to play along if I promised to over-prepare. At home my father had bought a cheap hinge and oil because the balcony door had been complaining in a voice we had decided was charming until it wasn\u2019t. I watched him unscrew and adjust, and the way the door swung after\u2014smoothly, without announcement\u2014felt like both a loss and a mercy. \u201cSometimes we need the squeak,\u201d I said, and he nodded as if I had offered him a memory he could put in his jacket pocket.\n\nLate, in the hour where the refrigerator thinks it is the only machine awake, Alba knocked on my door, not a performative tapping but the precise rhythm of permission. She stood with the sketchbook in her hands like a petition and came in when I said yes as if we had been practicing this choreography for months. \u201cI want to rewrite the corridor,\u201d she said, sitting on the floor, her back against my bed. \u201cThe narrowness should be generous. That sounds impossible, but so does weather that tastes like iron, and here we are.\u201d\n\nWe drew options and rejected them and tried again, and I made a list in the margin for her of all the moments I had felt the city require nearness: the bus stop when the rain had insisted, the registry office with its ferns, the hospital elevator, the aisle between poetry and theory at the bookstore on Calle San Francisco. She added her own: the stage wings, the distance between kettle and cup, the space where my name had been signed in her book and the paper hadn\u2019t protested. We laughed at the way we were both showoffs when nobody was watching, and we sat long enough that the night turned over and presented its other cheek.\n\n\u201cI should tell you something,\u201d I said, because Mara\u2019s voice lived in my brain as a benevolent bossy ghost. \u201cIt is not information so much as an orientation. When I am near you, I become precise in a way that makes the rest of my life both easier and impossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said, without triumph and without sorrow, and a small piece of me unclenched, the way hands do when they realize they will not be asked to carry their own weight forever. \u201cI am drawing stairs for us that are mostly for sitting. We can forgive whatever we cannot climb yet.\u201d\n\nWe did not kiss, which is not a vow of purity so much as an agreement with time. We sat there with graphite on our fingers and tea we had forgotten to drink going cold, and at some point our shoulders leaned until they were a single line that would be hard to draw without a ruler. When she left, she placed the sketchbook by my lamp and said, \u201cI am putting this here not because I don\u2019t trust my room but because I like the idea of these drawings sleeping under your breathing.\u201d When she closed the door, it did it without a squeak and I wasn\u2019t sure if that was a triumph or a failure I would learn to forgive.\n\nThe week folded itself like a map that remembers all the places your fingers pressed down. My mother, obedient to the rules I had asked for, wrote a message with a picture of a caf\u00e9 spoon and a line about trains that apologized twice and meant it once. My father bought lemons as if the fruit could guarantee the right kind of tartness to our days. Alba\u2019s mother learned how to make a stew from her sister\u2019s recipes without calling her for help and celebrated by inviting us all to eat it as if victory were a spice. Carmen\u2019s show extended its run by three nights and she walked around the city like a person who has found a door that finally recognized her as its own and opened on the first knock. Mara took my poem and put it in her notebook as if storing a friend\u2019s spare key.\n\nOn Thursday, the hospital called, but it was Nurse Ana inviting us to a volunteer recital that Nano had conned the ward into hosting. \u201cSpectacular,\u201d she said, and you could hear the grin in the word. \u201cBring your lists. The boy with the former cast wants to see if you\u2019ve learned new vocabulary for mischief.\u201d We went because saying yes to that building now felt like a way of honoring its stubborn intention to be a place where ends and beginnings share a wall. The ward smelled as it always had: oranges, gel, the soft tyranny of clean. The guitar volunteer was there, and a woman who looked like she had answered phones for a decade and then given the job her heart. Carmen recited a monologue from the play that had discovered its legs, and she did the nurse line without irony, and the real nurse who had given the line to fiction stood with her hand over her mouth struggling not to ruin her mascara. The boy drew me as a bus with wings and told me that this was how he imagined being released into a city. Alba stuck the drawing to the wall with medical tape and wrote under it in small letters, permission.\n\nWe walked out into a dusk that pretended it had invented itself just for us and turned at the corner where the vending machine now gave bananas that tasted like birth. Alba reached for my hand without ceremony when a motorbike roared too close to the curb, and I took it the way you take a tool you have already learned the weight of. We did not make it into a declaration, and we did not pretend it was nothing. We carried it to the bus stop and released it there because nearness is sometimes a public utility and sometimes a private altar, and the city was listening.\n\nWhen the rain returned, it did so in a thin script across windows and cheeks. I read again at the caf\u00e9 with the microphone that had learned to trust me, and a woman asked afterward whether the pigeons in my poems were metaphors or if I meant actual birds. \u201cBoth,\u201d I said, unable not to be myself, and she looked relieved, as if permission to believe two things at once had been withheld from her until now. My mother texted a photograph of a train ticket\u2019s underside for no reason I could parse and wrote, \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a month,\u201d and I did not write back until the next day because politeness is a tool and sometimes a weapon, and I am learning when to put my hands down.\n\nThe cactus chose, on a Tuesday at two in the morning, to open every bloom it had. Alba knocked on my door a more urgent rhythm and said, \u201cNow,\u201d and we stood in our socks near the windowsill and watched the flowers declare their foolish and perfect purpose. They smelled like milk and a decision postponed and finally made. We breathed like careful thieves, stealing what we were being given and promising to return it unharmed. \u201cThey\u2019ll close by noon,\u201d Alba said, her voice quiet with awe and regret. \u201cIt\u2019s all at once, and then they pretend they never did it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll make a list,\u201d I said, because I am not original when faced with miracles. \u201cThis, and the hospital courtyard light at four, and the sound of buses when they don\u2019t see you, and the way a hinge feels just before the oil decides to forgive it, and your professor\u2019s smile when you told her you wanted to design for what we fear, and my father\u2019s hands when he\u2019s trying to turn a lemon into evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will make a building,\u201d she said, \u201cwith a room that insists on blooming at unreasonable hours.\u201d We stood there until the flowers finished their sentence. When we finally slept, it was with the certainty that morning would pretend nothing had happened and that we would be brave enough to contradict it, gently.\n\nIn the afternoon, we hung the boy\u2019s drawing of the winged bus on our kitchen wall, below the lemon magnet, where it could learn the geography of our domestic weather. Alba added, in graphite, a tiny hinge in the corner of the page, not to be cute, but as a reminder of the quiet miracle that allows doorways to be both threshold and place to lean. I oiled the balcony\u2019s new hinge once because I am greedy for smoothness and then regretted it and learned to listen harder for the soft announcement of approach. The kettle, indifferent to metaphor, announced only itself and demanded we come make tea. We did, and the record player obliged the day with an old crackle and a piano that knows how to make a room exhale, and our family was a choreography that had learned more steps than it intended and performed them without falling.\n\nIf you ask me when the part of the story you\u2019re waiting for arrives, I can only tell you that we were already in it, that arrivals are sometimes just the moment you realize you haven\u2019t been waiting at all, you\u2019ve been walking. The city, in its iron and lemon wisdom, gave us what it gives everyone: weather and stairs and the option to hold onto the railing. We took it. We looked out, and in, and then we made another list, and then we put the list in the drawer with the spoons, because we believed in needing it again.Chapter 8 began on a day that believed itself to be ordinary and betrayed that belief by putting a small flag of light on the kitchen table where no window could have reached. The kettle staged its coup as usual; the radio measured traffic with its dry wrist; my father buttered toast with the concentration of a man who wants to keep disaster from hearing him eat. Alba had fallen asleep at the table over the model and woke with a cardboard triangle stuck to her cheek like a temporary tattoo. She peeled it off with dignity and set it on the stair to nowhere labeled practice, as if the model had been waiting overnight for an emblem. I made a list under my breath of rooms that deserve names and never get them\u2014the space between kettle whistle and cup, the three steps between a hospital bed and the window, the balcony where pigeons rehearse judgment\u2014and Alba listened the way a person listens to a weather report for a city she has not visited yet. I could tell from the set of her mouth that her professor had assigned something that required cruelty to be useful; I could tell from the way she tucked hair behind her ear that she was secretly excited to invent a solution nobody had thought to forbid. Carmen had sent a message at dawn that said, The curtain finally confessed. It smells like apology and I forgive it. Mara had sent one that said, You owe me two coffees for surviving last night\u2019s prose-poem boy, and attached a photograph of a croissant with a bite taken out that looked eerily like Oviedo\u2019s skyline. The city, outside our windows, did its exercise: buses expanding their lungs, rain stretching in thin bands between buildings, the woman with the pigeons deploying slices of stale baguette like treaties.\n\nI went to a morning class where the professor discussed clitic doubling as if it were a cousin who had moved in without asking and everyone had decided it was fine, and I learned nothing that would help me in the corridor between my door and Alba\u2019s. On the way out, a flyer flapped against the bulletin board declaring a spring festival I had forgotten the city hosts every year, promising balloons that would look sad by afternoon and music that would not be embarrassed to be performed in daylight. I took one of the tear-off tabs because I am weak in the face of paper strips inviting me to be social, and I texted a picture to Alba with the caption Research into public corridors, and she sent back a pencil emoji and a lemon and a drawing of a staircase that looked like a party hat. My phone pulsed a text from my mother that I did not open for three minutes to see if my blood had learned patience; when I opened it, it said, I found a door in Madrid that reminded me of ours. It was painted shut. I had the urge to knock anyway. I stared at it until the letters looked like a language I had yet to study, then put the phone face down and told myself that images are not obligations. At home, the balcony hinge that my father had oiled moved like a dancer who had decided to be gracious, and for a moment I resented the absence of squeak because it meant I had lost another method for detecting approach.\n\nAlba had a site visit that afternoon to a half-abandoned factory on the edge of the city where rust and geometry had been negotiating for decades without a union. She asked if I wanted to come, not because she needed an extra set of eyes, but because she has learned that I relax in the presence of things that admit their age. The bus there breathed opinions out its windows and dropped us in a neighborhood that specialized in remembering better days without hating the present. The factory had the dignity of a horse that has decided not to run anymore but will still tolerate a hand on its neck. Alba led me through a hole in a fence made polite with a piece of wire so the cut wouldn\u2019t catch on coats; inside, the floor had gathered the dust of five kinds of work and decided not to distinguish. Light entered through broken panes as if embarrassed by the grandeur of its entrance, and weeds rehearsed their insistence in the cracks. Alba set her bag down on a concrete ledge as if claiming a desk and began to draw the negative space between columns. \u201cI love buildings that admit they have been used,\u201d she said, her pencil marking time. \u201cAnd I love the arrogance of a door that still believes it can open even when somebody painted it shut twenty years ago. It holds its hinge like a secret.\u201d I walked the perimeter counting windows that had lost a pane and kept their shape anyway and thought about how language announces itself even in silence: the way you feel the difference between empty and vacant, the way abandonment smells like a particular decade of floor cleaner. When I came back to her side, she had drawn a corridor that would run through the center of the factory like a spine, wide enough to let mothers with strollers and teenagers who needed to learn how to walk past one another without turning themselves to iron.\n\nWe took our research to the river because water is the bachelor apartment of our better ideas, and I sat on the low wall staring at the surface as if hoping for subtitles. Alba flipped the sketchbook closed after a minute, either to keep her lines from escaping or to spare them my weather. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of going to Le\u00f3n this weekend,\u201d she said, without a flourish, as if placing a mug on a table to test if the surface wobbled. \u201cThere\u2019s a library there with windows that remind you that glass is a form of patience, and my mother wants to return a casserole dish to an aunt who thinks food is a method of attack. Do you want to come and pretend to be objective about my old streets?\u201d The question put its hands in my pockets and waited for my coins. I wanted to say yes the way a person wants to sit on stairs that never end. I wanted to say no because going into her before felt like daring the present to identify itself. I said, \u201cIf the bus is cheap, and if Oviedo promises not to be jealous.\u201d She smiled that way she does when I build a cage for a bird and then leave the door open. \u201cIt will rain there too,\u201d she said. \u201cThe iron tastes different. You can take notes.\u201d We sat until the river decided to change season without telling anyone, and then we walked home through streets that had perfected the smell of damp cardboard and soup.\n\nAt the flat, a bouquet of parsley had once again pretended to be flowers on the counter, and my father left us a note propped against the kettle that said Dinner at seven and a half, please remind me to breathe and also to call the plumber about the sink that likes to be a lake. Alba\u2019s mother bustled in with a bag of oranges and a recipe she had written on the back of a bill because paper is democratic that way. The four of us performed the choreography that has become our religion: slicing, stirring, discussing the day as if it were a country we could hold between thumb and forefinger and examine for counterfeit. When we sat, my father said grace in the language of spoon placement and my name, and Alba\u2019s mother told us a story about her sister and a roast chicken that had nearly proposed marriage, and I watched Alba draw a door in her soup with her spoon and resist walking through. After, while the dishes considered their mortality in the sink, my phone hummed with my mother\u2019s persistence. This time the message was not a story but an explicit question: May I bring you something from Madrid that you cannot get there? Please say yes. I took the phone to the balcony and considered composing a list that would punish and forgive simultaneously\u2014things like patience, absence that doesn\u2019t announce itself, a night that ends when it should\u2014but lists are my tools, not my weapons, and I refused to blunt them against our old stone. I wrote back, Bring me a notebook with strong paper. And a pen that doesn\u2019t run. The ones that can take ink like a sky takes weather. She sent a heart that looked embarrassed to be so pink and wrote, I can do that.\n\nThe spring festival arrived like someone\u2019s cousin who always suggests karaoke and then sings better than anyone expected. The square bloomed with stalls selling objects that should not have been beautiful and were: woven baskets the color of rainwater, cheap bracelets that would make the wrists of teenagers into declarations, a knife sharpener who whistled like a kettle whenever he found the edge. The woman with the pigeons had retired to a bench and allowed children to take her place; they deployed bread with a strategy that made the birds reconsider their politics. Alba and I wandered, making an architectural survey of temporary structures, and I argued for the genius of a tent that had no right angle to its name. Carmen found us with a pretzel the size of her head and a grin the size of the day and declared, \u201cYou have not lived until you have seen a mayor dance to a brass band without shame,\u201d and dragged us toward the stage where the city fathers and mothers performed their particular version of belonging. Mara joined with a paper cone of chestnuts that burned our fingers in a way that felt like a moral. We watched a clown convince a group of solemn eight-year-olds that their seriousness was a party hat in disguise, and we listened to a soap seller pitch his lathers with the patter of a man versed in repentance, and we let the afternoon be as long as it wanted to be.\n\nIt was almost virtuous, the amount of normalcy we performed, until Alba\u2019s mother noticed a woman across the square whose coat I had come to know too well at a distance. My mother stood near the lemonade stall, considering a jar of something that had been called honey by a person willing to commit to that lie, and she did not see us because her eyes were busy auditioning sweetness. My father\u2019s back went straight, the way it does when he is about to get through something by pretending nobody is looking. Alba\u2019s mother squeezed his forearm once and then put her hand around her cup of coffee as if it had asked to be held through a storm. \u201cDo you want to leave?\u201d Alba asked, softly, offering me the corridor out, offering to become the door. I looked at my mother\u2019s profile which is a sketch my muscles know how to flinch at, and I felt the precise weight of the pen she had promised, and I said, \u201cNo. We can let the square be big. It is allowed to contain her and us without collapsing.\u201d We stood our ground without pretending to be rooted, and my mother eventually looked up, saw us, and did not approach, which felt like a discipline I had not credited her with. She lifted the jar at me as if to ask, Do you believe in honey in this weather, and I lifted my paper cone of chestnuts and shrugged, and the conversation ended there without anyone losing skin.\n\nWe went to Le\u00f3n on Saturday under a sky that could not be bothered to choose a mood. The bus climbed past hills that had decided green was not a color but a manifesto, and Alba pointed out the derelict silos with more affection than derelict structures are used to. Le\u00f3n tasted like an old coin put under the tongue, copper and promise, and the streets remembered her in the way that streets do when a body has worn them properly. She took my hand without speeches when a crowd pressed us and let it go when the plaza widened, and in that space between I discovered an entirely new way to measure distance. We went to the library she loves and sat under windows that made the sky into geometric proofs; the room was full of that particular hush in which people dare silence to tell on them. Alba opened a book of buildings and showed me a staircase someone had made to be climbed only by the patient or the obsessive, and I took out the notebook my mother had given me at the station that morning, black cover, paper that promised to accept mistakes gracefully, and I wrote three sentences about the shape of a pause.\n\nWe ate in a cafe with chairs that insulted knees by being too low, and Alba drew a plan on a napkin for a courtyard with weather admitted on a schedule, and I drew next to it a list of words that change shape under pressure\u2014yet, perhaps, still\u2014and between us we made a place where strangers would be forced to confess their smallness and walk away taller. In the afternoon we visited her aunt with the casserole dish; the aunt was a person for whom hospitality was a sport and she had been training since the nineties. She looked me up and down with the efficiency of a customs agent and decided I could pass; she crushed almonds into a paste and insisted I learn the correct wrist for stirring, which apparently I have. She asked questions that treated us as if we were an old couple who had mislaid our wedding rings during a flood; we answered politely and inaccurately. On the bus back, Alba fell asleep with her head against the window, and I watched her reflection superimpose on farms and gas stations and late trains, and I thought about how the word step had failed to contain us from the start and how verbs are better than nouns for the weather we were in.\n\nBack in Oviedo, the week tried to revert to its template and failed because the template had been redrawn. I read again at the caf\u00e9 with the microphone that now leaned toward me like a dog amenable to instruction. My mother came and sat in the back and did not wave, and afterward she put a pen in my hand that was the kind of blue that lends itself to letters you regret and said, \u201cPaper is the only thing that forgives me,\u201d and I did not confess that I have preferred walls. My father and Alba\u2019s mother came on Thursday, the night I read the poem with the stair that refuses to go anywhere without telling you why, and their applause together made a new sound, a kind of domestic weather being recorded for the first time. Carmen brought three actors who heckled me lovingly with fingers snapped in rhythm and then bought me a beer with money they would regret spending on me in two days. Mara rolled her eyes when a boy recited a poem in which he was a wolf and the city was a forest that did not understand him, and then she kissed my cheek and said, \u201cYou are managing not to drown in a cup. I am proud of you,\u201d which is the kind of sentence that lasts for weeks.\n\nThe hinge you are waiting for squeaked in private first. It was late; rain had convinced itself it was necessary; the kettle had all but lost its voice from overuse. Alba and I sat at the kitchen table after the parents had gone to bed, the sketchbook between us like a treaty that also functioned as a mirror. She had put the Building of Necessary Closeness aside for the evening and was drawing faces without permission from their owners: my father thinking about nothing out loud for once, Carmen rehearsing with a whistle in her teeth, Mara preparing to destroy a boy\u2019s argument at fifty paces. She drew me last, a mercy and a cruelty, and when she finished a line and turned the book so it faced me, I felt the small click in my chest like a lock receiving the proper key. She had drawn my mouth as if it was carrying a confession and my collarbone as if it remembered a hand. Beneath, in small tidy letters, she had written, \u201cT gathers light like a misplacing and then returns it exact.\u201d\n\nI looked up, prepared to make a joke about possession and optics, and found her already looking. I have learned the weight of many looks; this one was calm enough to convince a cat to admit guilt. It did not demand; it did not request; it acknowledged. \u201cI am tired,\u201d she said, and smiled the way you smile when tired is a pronoun. \u201cBut not of you.\u201d She reached across the table and put her fingers lightly on my wrist, an angle that gave her plausible deniability if a parent appeared and also made my pulse behave like a small ridiculous horse. We sat that way long enough for the kettle to complain and for the rain to forget why it was here. Then she stood, and so did I, and the distance between standing and not standing turned out to be exactly the length of a hinge.\n\nThere is a version of this moment that involves throwing propriety into the sink and explaining ourselves to the wall afterward. We did not take that version. We walked to the balcony in the placebo of a lull and paused under the lamp that makes our skin the color of old photographs. The street below performed its late shift without checking our calendars. Alba turned to me with the caution of a person approaching a dog she knows and loves but does not want to startle. \u201cIf we,\u201d she said, and then laughed once at the ridiculousness of beginning with if we when she could have picked any other words, \u201cif we call this a question, will it be easier to answer?\u201d The flower of the cactus across the way had finished its performance days ago and was now a closed fist; we both looked at it as if it might translate.\n\n\u201cI am more patient with questions than answers,\u201d I said, because accuracy is the only gift I trust myself to bring to any altar. I stepped closer by the width of a lemon peel. She stepped closer by the thickness of her pencil shavings collected in a jar. The first touch was not a declaration or a theft; it was an edit. I kissed the corner of her mouth, a place that is overlooked in bad films and beloved in good lives, and she did not startle or sigh or perform anything; she moved toward me the fraction necessary to make the geometry true. It was not a long kiss; it was not a brief kiss; it was exactly the length of a corridor designed by somebody who understands that passing is the same as arriving if you intend well enough. We stood with our foreheads touching afterward like two children who have learned that earthquakes cannot be prevented by posture and decide to try anyway. Then we went back to the table and drank tea that had cooled into a different bargain, and we drew, deliberately, two doors on the same page. On one we wrote later. On the other we wrote now. We agreed to open both, but not at once, because we are not in the business of setting our own house on fire and then praising ourselves for the warmth.\n\nOf course someone knocked, because the universe belongs to playwrights. It was the rhythm of error: three taps too quick, then a hesitation that sounded like the back of a hand wiping sweat from a forehead. Alba slid the sketchbook under a folded newspaper with the fluidity that suggests both guilt and rehearsal. I went to the door and listened the way you listen to pipes; outside, a woman cleared her throat. My mother had decided to test the rules at nine at night, which in my personal system counts as a war crime. \u201cT,\u201d she said, soft enough that a less treacherous door would not have heard. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. The hotel\u2014there was\u2014never mind. I shouldn\u2019t have come.\u201d Alba stood behind me in the kitchen doorway, body like a comma, indicating continuation. I could feel my father\u2019s door across the hall become aware of itself; I could picture his mouth shaping No before Yes and then deciding to say nothing.\n\nI opened the door because the hinge had been oiled and because my cowardice has always been polite. My mother stood there with her coat open and her scarf done up like a complicated apology, hair that had forgotten to care. She held no bags, which made her look less like a danger and more like a sentence that had removed its punctuation. \u201cI know,\u201d she said, preempting me like a person used to arguing against the weather. \u201cNo kitchens. I am a kitchen fire. I should leave.\u201d I stepped back enough that she would not be wet by our stairwell rain and not enough to invite her into our low lamp and our kettle\u2019s jurisdiction. Alba moved neither forward nor backward; she acknowledged my mother with a nod that said, I know you are a noun in our grammar and I will not decline you out loud.\n\n\u201cYou can stand there,\u201d I said, which sounds like cruelty and is perhaps the most precise kindness I had offered her. \u201cYou can tell me what is wrong and I will tell you if I can help without breaking anything we have spent a year repairing.\u201d She breathed, which sometimes counts as a yes. The problem was small and humiliating: her bank card had sulked; the hotel wanted collateral; the friend who would have given her a couch had turned out to be and not to be a friend. I could have summoned a lecture on planning and on weather forecasts; I did not. I handed her the money from the jar we keep for emergencies of a more domestic variety\u2014plumber, light bulbs, lemons\u2014and said, \u201cThis is not generosity. This is a system we are participating in. You will return it the way rain returns vapor to the air after having its fun.\u201d She did not cry, for which I would have loved her if loving her were a thing I felt I could do safely; she looked at Alba and said, \u201cThank you,\u201d without naming her relation, which made me love Alba on the spot with a kind of accuracy that bordered on violence.\n\nWhen my mother left, the stairwell ate the sound of her steps responsibly. I closed the door. I put my forehead against it like someone eavesdropping on wood. Alba did not come to touch me; she dried a cup that had not been washed yet and placed it in the cupboard without looking. \u201cYou did not break anything,\u201d she said into the small domestic noise of porcelain and shelf. \u201cIf anything, you repaired something, neatly.\u201d I turned and leaned on the door, too long for it to qualify as a joke. We did not celebrate ourselves. We washed the few dishes that had not asked to be washed and we went to our rooms and we leaned against our own doors for a minute because sometimes you need to share a wall with yourself.\n\nThe city delivered the next morning as if nothing had been asked of it in the night. The woman with the pigeons scolded a child for giving too much at once; the buses bargained with lights; the sky pretended to be kind until noon. I met my mother in a caf\u00e9 near the station with a chair that had an opinion about my spine, and she handed me an envelope with the money and a receipt from the hotel as if to prove she had not invented the emergency. We drank coffee that had survived a war in its machine, and she told me about her day as if it were a book someone else had left on a table. \u201cI am learning,\u201d she said, \u201cthat apology is a skill and not a mood.\u201d I told her about a pen that ran and paper that accepted it and a factory that wants to be a corridor, and we performed the theatrical politeness that keeps certain buildings standing.\n\nThe day ended with an event too small to dignify in some narratives and too significant to ignore here: the model of the Building of Necessary Closeness fell off the table. It was nobody\u2019s fault, which, like apology, is an art. One minute the model had been obeying gravity with grace; the next it committed to flight and failed. The narrow corridor split along the seam where we had forced it to be generous. The stair to nowhere detached and lay splayed like a sentence that had forgotten its verb. Alba sat on the floor next to the wreckage and did not touch it because she had learned in hospital rooms that you let broken things declare their injuries before you try to set them. I sat with her and waited for cardboard to admit what it was ready to do. My father crouched with his large careful hands and said, \u201cTape and time,\u201d as if ordering at a bar. Alba\u2019s mother fetched the good glue from the high shelf where the pharmacy lives and placed it in Alba\u2019s palm with a ceremony that made me feel the weight of small bottles.\n\nWe repaired it, which is poetry\u2019s ugly cousin, and we did it with a concentration that canceled the city\u2019s performance outside our windows. The corridor, rejoined, accepted its seam as part of its line; the stair, reaffixed, declared its uselessness with renewed pride. Alba looked at me with glue on her fingers like the evidence of a long letter, and I thought, not for the first time, that the days are not enemies when they hand you this much material. We placed the model back on the table as if returning a body to a bed after making it lighter with names, and the four of us stood around it with the solemnity reserved for the least dramatic sacraments. After, Alba and I took the lemon magnet and moved the boy\u2019s drawing of the bus with wings to make room for a note written in her precise hand: Repair is a form of design. We looked at it, and then we let the kettle boss us back into motion, and the record player consented to be asked and responded with a crackle that sounded like rain remembering how to speak.\n\nLater that night, when the flat had placed its sleeps in the correct rooms, I went to Alba\u2019s door and knocked that permission rhythm we have taught one another. She said, \u201cYes,\u201d and I entered, which is the most underrated achievement any person can hope for. The sketchbook lay open to the page with later and now; we had drawn the doors and not opened either. I took my pen, the blue my mother had given me as if to atone for every black she had used to write her leaving, and I wrote under later: patience is not postponement; under now I wrote: permission is not ruin. Alba read the annotations as if they were building codes; she looked up and smiled from the muscles in her cheeks all the way to the ones you can\u2019t see and said, \u201cWe can work with that.\u201d We turned off the light not because we are chaste or dramatic but because night deserved at least one unobserved generosity, and we sat in the almost-dark with the window letting in the iron of Oviedo and the soft announcements of buses doing their job, and we leaned shoulder to shoulder like a pair of hinges agreeing not to squeak, not tonight.Chapter 10 began like a door that didn\u2019t realize it had been left ajar and had the humility to swing itself back without making a speech. The morning put a small coin of sunlight on the floor by the window, a brightness that confused the cat on the balcony below into thinking it had been granted a promotion. The kettle tried to stage its usual coup and failed in a new way; the whistle rose and then flattened into an embarrassed wheeze, like a singer who has woken up in the wrong octave. My father thumped the counter with the heel of his hand as if reminding oak where it comes from would help metal remember its purpose; Alba tilted her head toward the sound, that surgeon\u2019s listening she has, and said, without drama, \u201cIt\u2019s the gasket.\u201d I do not know when I learned the word gasket; perhaps it entered the house through the same door as lemon peels and patience. I put my ear near the spout like a person trying to overhear a confession and heard not a failure but a tiredness. \u201cTape and time,\u201d my father said again, this time to an appliance, and I thought of the note on the model: Repair is a form of design. Outside, the city rubbed its iron into the day until we tasted it with our toast; the woman with the pigeons wagged a finger at a seagull that had wandered into the regime; the buses rehearsed their enunciation and almost got it right.\n\nThe university sent me an email with a subject line that inflated itself like a frog: Regional Literary Evening, Confirmed Speakers, Logistics. The body was more polite and less confident; a coordinator asked if I might read two poems and a prose piece because \u201cyour work seems to understand that nouns have hearts.\u201d I snorted into the cheap yogurt and then wrote back yes, because I am learning that saying yes out loud to the kinds of invitations I used to laminate in my head is a way to become a person other than my worst rehearsal. Alba\u2019s professor, not to be outdone by any frog, had posted the schedule for the end-of-term review and her name appeared in a column under the bold seriousness of External Jury, which meant real architects with opinions fashioned into sharp accessories would stand in front of her cardboard and graphite and tell her who she had been pretending to be. She read the schedule and set it down and slid her pencil under the spine of her sketchbook as if she were tucking a blade into a boot. \u201cGood,\u201d she said, and the word had so much architecture in it that the chairs straightened their backs.\n\nMy mother sent the notebook she\u2019d promised, and I hated it a little for being beautiful. It arrived in an envelope that had survived the mail as if the mail had been generous, which is not its reputation. The cover was black and honest; the paper inside had that slight resilience under your finger that says, I will forgive at least two drafts, maybe three. Tucked into the first page was a letter written with the ink that had always been her weakness, a blue that made my mouth think of winter beads on wire when I was small and she used to fix necklaces at the kitchen table as if mending could be a living. I did not read it at the table; I put it under the lemon magnet as if giving it the same jurisdiction as recipes and a child\u2019s drawing of a bus with wings would prove that it could not carry fire. I read it later on the balcony with my shoulder pressed against the cold railing like a person asking a train to please arrive. She wrote sentences like dressing rooms: some mirrors, some hooks to hang anger on, some light that was too forgiving and then suddenly mean. She wrote that apology is a room she keeps sweeping and never finds the corners of; she wrote about Madrid\u2019s doors in summer, how they swell and stick and have to be persuaded without humiliation; she wrote she\u2019d stood outside a painted-shut door with her hand raised and had not knocked for the first time in her life, a personal applause she didn\u2019t trust; she wrote that she had been wrong about the shape of hunger and perhaps about the shape of love. She did not ask me anything, which is a trick I recognized from both good letters and superior manipulation; she happened near me on paper and waited to see if I would follow. I folded the pages back into the notebook and carried it to my desk and set it next to Alba\u2019s sketchbook and the nearness of the two felt like a joke I did not know how to tell.\n\nCarmen dragged us to a post-rehearsal after-something on a Tuesday in a bar two streets from the theater, a place where the lamps pretend to be old and the bottles have learned to present their labels as if they were diplomas. She wore a sweater with a rip at the hem that had transformed into identity, and she had a new way of saying citizen that included the bartender, which is a coup most actors don\u2019t manage. Mara sat with her feet tucked on her chair as if chairs were suggestions and not rules, and they bickered in a way that promised either violence or a collaboration; I am a romantic when it comes to the idea of people who spar with verbs and come away with fewer wounds than better jokes. The power didn\u2019t go out and there were no dragons in the ceiling, so we were forced to admit we like ordinary nights when nobody performs calamity. Alba watched Carmen explain how a line that had refused to be said for a week finally lay down and let itself be rehearsed, and she smiled with her mouth and her fingers, both, because good sentences and good stairs give her the same satisfaction: they bear weight without asking to be admired every second. I sat there trying to remember what it is I know how to do other than hold the ends of someone else\u2019s courage while they tie a knot.\n\nThe kettle took its grievance to a higher register the next morning. The gasket, which had been a theory, announced itself as a fact; steam insisted on unprofessional exits. My father took the thing apart on our kitchen table with a concentration he reserves for the moons of Jupiter and receipts, and the kettle, stripped of its lemon anonymity, looked indecent, a naked metal body that had trusted us too much. \u201cWe\u2019ll get a new one on Sunday at El Rastro,\u201d Alba\u2019s mother said, using \u201cwe\u201d like a truce flag. \u201cIf we find the right dent.\u201d Alba, stubborn in a way that sometimes makes me think of saints who refuse to give up roads they loved, said, \u201cWe can fix it,\u201d and went to find the brown paper tape and a piece of soft rubber she had kept from some other emergency. We sat as if at the surgery of a brass patient; she patched with that careful hand she uses when disappointment is watching. The whistle returned a portion of itself, just enough to be recognized, and we applauded the way you do when a child bows after a school recital and you are applauding not for music but for courage. \u201cRepair is a form of design,\u201d I said, pointing at the note we\u2019d taped by the model, and my father kissed the gasket with a ridiculous solemnity he would deny in court.\n\nSundays at the flea market are not Madrid\u2019s Rastro, but Oviedo\u2019s version has learned how to pretend. The stalls spread their pride down a side street that can carry the smell of frying oil and old jeans and optimism without flinching. We went as a unit because that is how we shop when we are pretending not to: Carmen joined as if she had always been invited and began trying on hats nobody asked her to pay for; Mara came because flea markets are where she practices saying no and yes in equal measure; my father held his hands behind his back as if to signal to the years that he would not touch them; Alba and I hunted kettles in the way you hunt deer in films, with coats and code. We found three that qualified for our interest: a blue that was too proud, a stainless one that looked like the future had failed to arrive, and a lemon-yellow twin to ours with a dent in exactly the wrong place, which is to say precisely where memory lives. The vendor, a man with a face built out of old tools and triumphs, saw the way Alba\u2019s eyes did not leave that dent and said, \u201cIt works, but you have to speak soft to it.\u201d Alba turned the kettle in her hands like a person evaluating a conch; she looked at me; I looked at my father; he looked at the sky, which had the decency to ignore him. We bought it not to replace but to understand. \u201cWe will cannibalize,\u201d Alba said on the walk home, and I loved her with my list-maker\u2019s heart for saying out loud the plan we were not yet ready to sentimentalize: the old giving its small good pieces to the old, so both can continue their impossible work.\n\nThe week advanced with the stubborn gait of a person recovering from a knee injury. I rehearsed aloud, sometimes to the lemon magnet, sometimes to the new-not-new kettle, and sometimes to the empty hallway where the sound of my own voice forces me to file my verbs without complaint. The Regional Literary Evening has the kind of name that makes a certain type of poetry curl into itself, but the people in it were the good kind: teachers with permanent markers on their fingers, students with patience in their shirts, an old woman with hair installed like royalty who would tell me afterward that my pigeons reminded her of mass. Alba printed pin-up boards and built a small backup model in case the jury decided to call her bluff on stairs that pretended to do nothing; she wore her pencil behind her ear as if she had been born with it camouflaged in hair. We took turns standing in the kitchen reading and pinning and not fainting. Carmen brought us energy in the form of stolen theater snacks that taste like cardboard and survival; Mara brought us doubt that she had sanded into support.\n\nMy mother wrote nothing for three days and then a message that didn\u2019t know whether it was an apology or a weather report. She said she had stood on a Madrid sidewalk and listened to a street musician insist that Thelonious Monk is a city and had resisted the urge to correct him. She said she had found an old photograph of me with my hair in a fight with itself and a lemon in each hand and had had the indecency to cry. She did not ask when she could come again. I replied with a sentence that had been trying to be born for a month: I need you to keep to the rules because I have used up my spare parts on other repairs. She sent back the word understood three times, as if she hoped repetition could be a hinge.\n\nThe evening of readings unfolded like a well-behaved train: it arrived, it made its stops, it apologized for delays it hadn\u2019t committed. The room had more people than chairs wanted to accommodate and some of them leaned against the walls in ways that would make a fire inspector sweat with joy. The organizers had hung prints of the city at dusk as if we needed proof of what we were doing; a table at the back held those small bottles of water that make adults feel like children playing conference. I read the bus poem because it now expects to be read when there are microphones and bread; I read the corridor piece because I wanted to say out loud that passing is a kind of architecture, not just courtesy; I read a new paragraph about repair and how tape is a confession and glue an oath. My father sat next to Alba\u2019s mother on the left side as if left side were a meaningful location; they held hands when they forgot to be cautious. Alba sat on the right next to Carmen and Mara and their combined attention behaved like a rope bridge: it swayed, but I trusted it. Halfway through the second piece I saw my mother at the very back, half in the hall, a student\u2019s chair holding her as if chairs should not have been expected to carry that much history. I did not change a word; I did not remove a metaphor I had written with her in mind; I did not add a line to make her life easier or my argument stronger. When it ended, the clapping was the good kind, the clapping that holds no pity in its palms. Alba came to me first, because she knows how to be both now and later; she put her hand briefly on my shoulder, a public gesture that means more to me than any private thunder; Carmen kissed the air near both my cheeks as if blessing me with theatrical unction; Mara squeezed my fingers until my nails were proof that I am alive. My mother approached not like a penitent or a thief but like a citizen of weather; she said \u201cthank you\u201d and nothing else, and I let that be our entire language for a day.\n\nThe review was two mornings later in a room that had been painted white so often it had begun to look like a palace that had read an article about restraint. The external jury entered with scarves and opinions; their shoes whispered they had been in buildings we could not afford to visit. Students pinned up their boards with hands that shook in languages I didn\u2019t know the names of; someone dropped a model and four men looked away in polite horror, which is the kindest thing grownups can do when a thing breaks in public. Alba took her place in front of the Building of Necessary Closeness and stood with the posture she keeps for storms: not aggressive, not retreating, simply present. She introduced the stair to nowhere as practice and the corridor as policy; she talked about fire with such respect that one of the men glanced involuntarily toward the exits. They asked her about heat and air and disability and a culture that can barely stand to brush a sleeve against a stranger; she answered in a way that made one of the women look down to cover her smile and then up again to perform rigor. I watched the professor with storm-cloud hair restrain herself from being proud; she succeeded only in the sense that lightning succeeds in being quiet. When Alba finished, there was a kind of silence that feels like a hand extended for a handshake, and then the woman with the serious shoes said, \u201cYour wrongness is useful,\u201d and pinned a note in yellow that read: Keep the nearness; design the mercy with more cruelty. Alba nodded and later, much later, when we were home and the kettle was finally willing to be itself again, she laughed about the paradox of being told to be more cruel in order to reach kindness.\n\nWe took the repaired model to an exhibition in a municipal hall that smelled like pension papers and ceremonies. On the walk there it rained sideways with the relish of a master remembering its trick; we wrapped the cardboard in a plastic sheet that had been a painter\u2019s drop cloth when my father tried to teach a wall to behave. At the hall, the corridor to the display room adapted itself into a test of vows: it narrowed twice, inconveniently, and the second time Mara laughed and said, \u201cYour building has manifested.\u201d We turned the model sideways and then diagonally and then stood still until a man with a dolly offered his vehicle like a knight in an elevator. We thanked him and practiced gratitude as a choreography while we cleared a corner of a table and wrestled our cardboard into the slice of space that had been allotted to us by a person who loves metrics. We hung the note Repair is a form of design at the top left, not as doctrine this time, but the way religious people hang a saint beloved for her stubbornness. In the little storeroom beside the hall, where a mop leaned like a person who had seen it all and chosen to remain civil, Alba put her forehead briefly against my shoulder and let out the breath I had heard her collect all morning. I did not take advantage of any of the versions of us that room might have allowed; I stood and leaned back just enough to make it clear I was not giving her to gravity. We listened to the life of the hall\u2014the coughs out front, the municipal clatter, the plastic tarp sighing itself into place\u2014and we laughed because exhibitions are just public storage with better lighting.\n\nThat night the rain remembered itself as theater and threw itself at our windows with the same ambition as an actor who has been given one line and decides it is monologue. The new gasket, the old kettle, the replacement kettle, the apartment\u2019s wires, the window\u2019s seal\u2014all held. The ceiling, however, decided to express an opinion above the narrow corridor between our rooms. It began as a single dark petal and then gathered a bouquet; the first drip was the size of a rude remark; the second established a rhythm. We set bowls down like applause. The sound\u2014the high plink of ceramic, the lower thud when the water forgot itself and overshot\u2014became a music that threatened to be a metaphor and therefore had to be interrupted occasionally by laughter. My father called the emergency number for men who believe in ladders and one arrived with the resigned cheer of people who have saved kitchens from worse. He poked the ceiling with the kind of authority that makes even plaster tell the truth; he declared it a roof line sulk; he promised nothing and brought a tarpaulin joy into our house. The hinge squeaked again when he left, and I kept the squeak like a whistle around my neck because not all smoothness is mercy; sometimes you want to be warned when a door decides to love you enough to open.\n\nWe decided to be brave in small, repeatable ways. We kissed again, in a kitchen after midnight where the bowls still gathered what the roof could not hold, and we did not leave evidence on the counter except two cups turned upside down to dry in the way my grandmother taught me. We told no one the thing we were telling ourselves, not yet; we agreed with a degree of cruelty that made mercy possible that we would not sacrifice our house to a meaning it could not withstand. We walked in the city not as a demonstration but as practice; our shoulders found a distance that is evident only to the bodies involved; occasionally our hands experimented with gravity and passed, briefly, in a space where passing is a kind of ownership. Carmen noticed once and did not write a play about it; Mara noticed twice and put the knowledge in the place she keeps for people who are not yet ready to congratulate themselves.\n\nLists returned because I am more myself with them than without. I made a list of things that belong to the wrong rooms: my mother\u2019s letter on the balcony, the lemon magnet in my father\u2019s pocket because he likes to worry it like a coin, the way Alba\u2019s model pieces appear on the bathroom sink like fish that jumped. I made a list of sounds for the hospital ward because Nurse Ana left a voice message that was just the word spectacular and I felt called to respond: the muffled applause of socks on linoleum, Nano\u2019s dragon-free hum near the tape, the guitar\u2019s careless mercy, the click of gel bottles, and the way someone says hello from behind a curtain because privacy has decided to be a joke for five minutes. I made a list of words we must not use yet: girlfriend, betrayal, forever, accident; and a corresponding list of words we could rehabilitate: practice, hinge, corridor, permission.\n\nMy mother asked for a time and I gave her one; we sat on a bench where the city lets teenagers try out boredom without lasting harm, and she asked about the reading not so she could say she was there but so she could say I was; she says my name now as if I had some claim to it she is willing to recognize. She did not ask about Alba; she asked about linguistics with that glass in her voice that used to be charm; I told her about the passive habitual and she laughed and said, \u201cFinally a mood I understand,\u201d and it is possible to love a joke without loving the person who made it. When we parted, she touched the notebook as if not sure whether to ask it for custody. I told her she could send sentences into it if they didn\u2019t ask to be answered; she sent three that night that were just descriptions of rain in Madrid and none of them used iron and I decided that was fair.\n\nThe city staged a minor riot of spring; the trees on Avenida de Galicia did that thing where they trick you into thinking leaves are a decision you can make every morning; the woman with the pigeons let a toddler hand her a piece of bread to distribute as if training him for a powerful office; the buses, benevolent and tired, carried us away from and toward all the places that make a week hold together. Alba\u2019s model stood at its municipal post as if it had always belonged there, and sometimes when we walked by she would straighten a corner like a mother smoothing a cowlick on a child, and I would pretend not to notice in case my noticing made her stop.\n\nOn a Thursday that had grown exhausted from being responsible, Carmen and Mara turned up at our door with a deck of cards and a bag of potatoes, because nothing says you are planning a harmless evening like starchy vegetables and chance. We cooked the potatoes into a thing that argued about the right word for itself and played a game where losing meant you had to confess a small truth that would not break the room. Carmen admitted she steals chalk from rehearsal rooms and feels no remorse because chalk needs more stage time; Mara said she pretends not to know the end of plays she has memorized so she can be newly angry at old men every week; my father said he thinks the lemon magnet is luck and kisses it when he believes we do not see; Alba said she designed the first sketch of the corridor because she wanted to make us all brush by the necessary and now she doesn\u2019t know how to stop. I said I have kept every list I wrote in the hospital in a folder with the spine broken and I open it when I need to remember that attention is political; no one asked me what I mean by political, for which I adored them all.\n\nWhen we went to bed, the night put one of those false lights on the kitchen table again, a coin we couldn\u2019t account for. The hinge announced, gently, every time someone moved through the hallway, back and forth, back and forth, practicing arrivals that refused to call themselves that. The kettle, repaired, elected to sing rather than wheeze, and there is a humility in fixed things that new things will always envy. I lay there and listened to the apartment\u2019s small congress, and I thought about the page in the sketchbook with the two doors labeled later and now and the annotations we had added and the ones we had yet to earn, and I thought about how to write into a life without setting it on fire first. The answer, when it came, was not complicated and not noble: we would go on, and that would be the bravest thing we could manage, until we could not, and then we would design the repair.",

                              "content": "They say the rain in Oviedo carries the taste of iron, and I believed it before I ever tasted it. The city breathes slowly, even when buses come in coughing clouds and taxi drivers curse at tourists idling by the cathedral. I have lived here all my life; I have learned to use its rhythms the way one learns to use a metronome, grudgingly, with an ear tuned to the slight shift of seconds. I walk past the old bookstore on Calle San Francisco, the one that leans into its own shadow like a conspirator, and I nod to the woman who feeds pigeons more dutifully than any priest feeds his congregation. I keep my umbrella folded, even when it drizzles, just to feel the fine spray on my face. Some people call that stubbornness. I call it calibration.\n\nMost mornings I take the long route to the university, because the short route passes my old school and I am easily ambushed by the ghosts of teachers with dry voices. I prefer the university\u2019s smell: damp stone, coffee burned at the edges, notebooks unfurling like white flags. I am twenty-one, supposedly proficient in noticing the right details and ignoring the ones that land like needles beneath the skin. Supposedly.\n\nWe live in a flat with a balcony that almost faces nothing: a sliver of street, a distant chimney, a bird that always looks like it has somewhere else to be. It became ours the way most things do\u2014someone else moved out of it, and we moved in. My father has a habit of arriving in rooms half a step before his shadow, and the night he came home with her, he stood in the doorway too long, as if he had miscounted his own footsteps.\n\n\u201cThis is my daughter,\u201d he said, turning to include me, though I had already been there, coiled like a spring on the sofa. \u201cAnd this is\u2014this is Alba.\u201d\n\nHe didn't say \u201cAlba is your\u2014\u201d because the word step-sister sat in his mouth like a coin he had forgotten how to spend. The legal papers had not yet been notarized, but the logic of the situation was simple. He married her mother, and two families became a single inventory. Chairs, plates, winter coats, griefs, habits. You think you can list them. You cannot.\n\nShe was taller than me by a head and a question mark. Her hair was black, not the soft brown of my father\u2019s beard or the lighter ash that my mother\u2019s photographs show me, and when she raised her eyes I felt something change in the room's size. You should know I am not easily impressed by eyes. But these eyes\u2014they were like two storms that had decided to become lakes. You could drink from them. You could drown, if that\u2019s what you wanted. I thought I knew what I wanted. Then I met her.\n\n\"Hi,\" she said, and her voice was warmer than the radiator in December. She wore a white shirt tucked into jeans and a wristwatch that ticked audibly. \"Your dad said you liked Thelonious Monk? My stepfather\u2014our stepfather, sorry\u2014he said that.\"\n\n\u201cHe did?\u201d I looked at my father, who looked at the floor. I had played one Monk record twice, three years ago, when I was trying to get through a breakup and a bottle. I failed at both. If you ask me to name a favorite musician, I say \u201cit changes\u201d in a voice that makes it sound like I am being generous.\n\n\"Yeah,\" she said. \"I brought some records. We can play them, if you want.\"\n\n\u201cWe don't have a record player,\u201d I said, and then felt stupid. But she smiled. \"We have one in the car,\" she said. \"I wasn\u2019t sure, so I brought it. I tend to bring my own weather.\"\n\nShe brought more than weather into our flat: she brought light into corners that had resigned themselves to darkness. She unpacked smooth plates and a cactus with bruised arms and a lemon-yellow kettle that whistled like a mile-long train, a kettle that would scald us into wakefulness every morning. She brought a poster of a city that wasn\u2019t Oviedo (Lisbon, yellow tram caught mid-sigh), a scarf with constellations printed across it, a jar of buttons. She brought her mother, who looked at my father with eyes full of forgiveness and math. Together we lined the shelves. Together we pressed ourselves into the smallness of a kitchen that was suddenly a stage where four people practiced the choreography of a new family.\n\nNight fell like a hand over the windows. We ate tortilla and smooth slices of tomato and something from a jar that Alba had made, peppers swimming in oil and garlic and vinegar. What is it called? Escabeche. I pulled a chair close to the table and listened to them talk about the easy details of merging: who takes out the trash which day, who buys the salt, who remembers to lock the balcony door, how eggs always go missing in families. From time to time I caught Alba\u2019s eye across the table, and her smile was small and true, like a ribbon tied where nobody else would see.\n\n\"And what do you study?\" she asked me, halfway through a second glass of wine.\n\n\"Linguistics,\" I said. \"Words about words.\"\n\n\"Ah! So you carry a mirror to the world, and there's a mirror inside, and another mirror inside that. Or I am mixing it up with barber shops.\"\n\n\"I can do barber shops, too,\" I said, and everyone laughed. And later, when the laughter had become the hum of dishes and the itch of sleep, I stood at the sink and Alba dried the plates, and we talked about the things that reveal nothing until you discover what they were hiding. We didn't talk about mothers or fathers or who had come from which direction, because those were obvious, or at least publicly obvious. We talked about the bus routes she had studied of her new city, the secret timetable of rain, the way the pigeons on the cathedral know the schedule of the human soul.\n\n\"What about you? What were you doing?\" I asked, making a shape with my palms in soapy water. \"Before here?\"\n\n\"I was in Le\u00f3n,\" she said. \"Studying architecture. But I needed a change of air. Nothing dramatic. I didn't have to be saved. I just wanted to look at new roofs.\"\n\nIt sounded almost like a joke. It was not. There are jokes that open the door to a secret, and there are sentences like this, which are keys.\n\nThat night I lay in my bed and listened to the new sounds of a house that had grown by one heart, then another. Alba's room was the one across the hall from mine, the one with the window that faced the sliver of street and the chimney; she had placed the cactus on the sill, as if she were warning pigeons that this was a thorned place. I heard her move around and then settle. I counted the beats between my pulse and hers, as if the walls had become a stethoscope. Past midnight, I got up to drink water. The low lamp in the living room cast a lemon half-glow over the record player she had set on the cabinet. Beside it, a paper bag. I pulled it open and saw a stack of records, different shades of cardboard and memory. Thelonious Monk really was there, \u201cSolo Monk,\u201d next to Nina Simone and a band I had never heard of, and something that had no label, just a hand-drawn crescent moon.\n\nI didn't play anything. I replaced the bag, went to bed, and slept five minutes at a time, like a cat waking on the hour to observe the world\u2019s ongoing disaster. Maybe this is this. Maybe this is one of those crossroads I have been told to avoid. Maybe it is one of those crossroads you step into and then become road yourself. I was not na\u00efve. I knew the words for almost everything. But names fail when the truth becomes a person in the next room, asleep.\n\nMy mother\u2019s picture on the dresser watched me with its old-gold sadness. She had left when I was eleven, for a city whose name my father still avoids. Not dead, but not here, which is its own kind of ghosting. When I met Alba, I thought, casually, you remember those faces you see once and then never again but they stay? That. That was my first thought. It was not good or bad. It was just the truth.\n\nThe city rose and sank. Alba learned to walk Oviedo the way a dancer learns to walk normal when she must. I learned the new weight of silence when her door was closed. We found rituals. We made breakfast together on Thursdays and argued over the crispness of bacon we could barely afford. We went shopping for things that seemed to multiply when you tried to count them\u2014sponges, carrots, pens\u2014and we carried them home in string bags that cut into our palms in a way that felt like proof. Proof of what? That we had hands, that they did more than satisfy our phones, that we could still build something more substantial than lists.\n\nMy best friend Mara from the university said, \"So, what's she like,\" in the half-mocking way only a best friend can manage. We were eating empanadas on the steps of a building that was pretending to be a castle. I gave her the surface answers: tall, funny, architecture, Le\u00f3n. I did not tell her the deeper fact: that when Alba stood in a doorway I wanted to catalogue the shadows she erased.\n\n\"You going to play her the Monk record?\" Mara asked.\n\n\"Already did,\" I lied. \"She was unimpressed.\"\n\nMara squinted at me. She has a face built for skepticism, a mouth that curves naturally into \"Really?\" \"Careful, T,\" she said. \"Families are like... you know when you fill a glass to the brim and it holds just slightly more water than it should, because of surface tension? And then you move it one millimeter and it spills. That.\"\n\n\"I'm not moving,\" I said. I was lying to her and to myself, in the same breath, the way bees talk to one another about flowers they haven't found yet.\n\nWe spent a Saturday afternoon at the Museum of Fine Arts because it was free and dry and large enough for people to disappear inside. Alba studied buildings in paintings the way a surgeon might look at a hand. She tilted her head as if dissections could be done at that angle. I drifted from room to room, reading placards and thinking about the paint that thickens and thins across a canvas, the way you can see time as a substance. When we met in front of a painting of a street in a rainstorm, she said, quietly, \"They always make the rain look clean. It isn't. It always has a little of the city in it.\"\n\n\"You're new here,\" I said. \"You can't be nostalgic yet.\"\n\n\"Maybe I am not nostalgic,\" she said. \"Maybe I am just precise.\"\n\nWe ate sandwiches in the courtyard. I don't remember what was in them. I remember the way her sleeve brushed my wrist and electricity traveled up my arm like a rumor that wouldn't die. I remember thinking: say nothing. That is the rule. Keep the words inside. They are yours. You don't have to donate them to the catastrophe fund.\n\nMy father stumbled into a happiness he wore like a jacket two sizes too big. He whistled in the mornings, a thing he had not done since I was small, and he looked at his phone at dinner the way teenagers do: not to escape but to take pictures of pasta, to show the world, \u201cLook, proof, evidence, an ordinary holiness.\u201d Alba\u2019s mother laughed when he sent them, teasing him, and he let her. You could see him learning to be seen, which is harder for men of his generation than anyone admits.\n\nOne night, after we had gone to the weekly jazz jam in a bar that pretended it was in New Orleans and still managed to be convincingly here, we walked home through the kind of drizzle Oviedo deploys when it wants to remind you that an umbrella is not a structure so much as a symbol. Alba tucked her hair behind her ears and looked up at a balcony where a cat sat like a judgment carved in stone.\n\n\"I've never liked cats,\" she said. \"They look at you like you're a plot twist they saw coming.\"\n\n\"I like that,\" I said. \"It means you can't surprise them, so if you manage to, wow.\"\n\n\"And you?\" she said. \"Do you like to be surprised?\"\n\n\"I like to be prepared for surprises,\" I said. We both laughed because it was such a Tallulah thing to say, and because it was impossible. A week later, she would be sick. A week later, I would learn exactly how little preparation is worth.\n\nBut this is not the story of a sickness, not exactly. Or, if it is, it is the story of a city that lowers its eyes when people cough in winter and of a hospital that hums regardless of who is watching.\n\nShe came out of the bathroom on a Tuesday morning looking pale but amused. \"The water is making a strange sound,\" she said.\n\n\"That's because the building is a decade older than God,\" I said, buttering toast with an aggression that was not about the toast. \"It needs to sigh before it functions.\"\n\n\"No, it's\u2014\" she started, and then she put a hand to her forehead. \"I think I'm\u2014\"\n\n\"Sit,\" I said, not knowing what else to do except wield the imperative. I pressed two fingers to her wrist as if I had become a nurse without training. The pulse was there, fast like a rabbit in a hedge. Her skin was hot.\n\n\"Maybe it's nothing,\" she said. \"Maybe I'm dramatic. You know I have that capacity.\"\n\n\"Me too,\" I said, but we did the sensible thing and took her temperature. The number blinked at us, then settled into a range that makes mothers worry even if they are two cities away. We made tea. We called the hotline the university sent around with flu season warnings. It was the season. The voice on the line was calm.\n\n\"Rest, fluids,\" the voice said. \"If she has other symptoms\u2014\"\n\n\"What other symptoms,\" I said, as if I could outrun them by listing them.\n\n\"Shortness of breath. Chest pain. Confusion.\"\n\n\"She already has confusion,\" I said, and Alba laughed, reflexively. The laughter ended in a cough that sounded like a nail in a board, sharp, bright, inevitable.\n\n\"Call us back if it gets worse,\" the voice said, and then we were alone with the tea and the pink tiles and the responsibility adults carry even when they pretend they do not. She carried herself to bed and I brought her water and the lemon-yellow kettle sang its long train song and the morning took on the hush of a church where somebody is praying too hard.\n\nHer mother called and called again. My father, at work, came home early and then left again because work has that way of believing in its own necessity. Alba slept. I sat by her and read from my linguistics textbook, words about words that did not make words behave. She woke and smiled and said, \"You're using your voice like a blanket,\" and I said, \"Go back to sleep.\" Outside, a siren went by that sounded like a child trying not to cry.\n\nWhen the fever climbed a second step we called a taxi. The driver had a face like a saint\u2019s statue left in the rain too long but his hands were steady. \"Hospitals,\" he said, in the tone people use when they mean, \"Another one.\" He made the city small, and the hospital grew large at the edge of it, white and humming, a ship in harbor. We went in with our paper masks and our quiet fear. They took her, they talked to her, they measured her, I waited. I was useless and entirely necessary in the way loved ones are: I answered the questions she couldn't be bothered to answer, I offered nothing useful but my presence. It is not nothing. Even when it feels like it is.\n\n\"There is a bed,\" the nurse said, with that shy triumph they wear when they can give you the one thing you want that they can actually give. \"It will be a day or two, maybe more. Fever. Hydration. You know.\"\n\n\"I know,\" I said, and I did and I did not. I wanted to argue with the air because it had failed to stay invisible in the right ways.\n\nThey moved her to a room in a wing with white corridors and blue signs that called themselves by numbers. 3C. Room 12. The walls were the wrong shade of forgiveness. The window faced a parking lot that believed in its own optimism because of one tree that had not yet given up its leaves. She was installed like a patient in a textbook illustration: bed, monitor, table with rolling wheels. The nurse stuck a name on the door like a badge on a uniform.\n\n\"I'll stay,\" I said, but there were rules, and they were rules because people are not good at not being near one another when one of them is burning. Visiting hours. Masking. Hand gel. Watch the trickle of numbers on the screen as if they were the score of a game you could influence by sheer attention. I did not like the rules. I obeyed them.\n\nShe settled under thin blankets and made a joke that made the nurse laugh and the nurse said, \"We like you. You're not the crying kind.\" I was the crying kind. I cried in the bathroom stall where the soap smelled like oranges. I cried in the cafeteria when they announced that the arroz a la cubana was finished. I called Mara and said nothing until she said, \"You sound like air in a bottle. Do you have what you need?\"\n\n\"She is okay,\" I said. \"They say she's okay. Fever. Rest. The usual.\"\n\n\"The usual is the most terrifying thing,\" Mara said. \"Do you need me to come?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, because it had to be no. Not for any noble reason. Because my panic had narrowed into a thin passage that would not allow other bodies.\n\nWhen I returned to the ward, she was asleep, and a young woman sat in the chair by her bed with a script balanced on her knees. Her hair was shaved on one side, dyed blue on the other, and her fingers shaped words in the air as if she were casting spells. She saw me and stood up quickly.\n\n\"I\u2019m sorry,\" she said. \"I didn't want to\u2014 I was waiting for the nurse. They said your\u2014your sister? She was dozing. I'm Carmen. They put me here yesterday. I talk. A lot.\"\n\n\"It's okay,\" I said, surprised by the sudden relief of another human who was not a nurse or a vending machine. \"I'm Tallulah.\"\n\n\"Beautiful name,\" she said, as if offering me back myself. \"I\u2014 I'm in theater. Well. I study theater. Sometimes I pretend hospital rooms are stages. It helps. With the fear.\"\n\n\"Does it?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes and no,\" she said. \"Everything helps. Nothing helps. Sorry. I say contradictory things when I haven't eaten. Do you want peanuts? I have fifteen packages.\"\n\nWe laughed softly the way people do in libraries and church. Alba shifted and opened her eyes. When she saw an extra person in the room, she smiled, a ghost of her usual brightness, but a brightness nonetheless.\n\n\"This is Carmen,\" I said. \"Our neighbor. Of geography, not life.\"\n\n\"Hi,\" Alba said, and Carmen\u2019s fingers shaped a hello in midair. Later I would learn she had a deaf brother and a habit of signing even when nobody else could understand. Later I would learn she had the kind of energy that makes hospitals less like ships and more like docks where you could lean and talk to someone about what the sea had taken. Later, too, I would learn to hate her with a ferocity reserved for saints. Not because she did anything wrong. Because she existed where I wanted to be the only one.\n\nYou see the fix, right? The equation that shows its teeth but not its solution?\n\nThe nurse came in and told me I had to leave, because the clock had rolled into a square called Visiting Ends. I wanted to argue with numbers. I did not. Alba squeezed my hand. Her fingers were warm, no longer too hot. \"Go,\" she said. \"Sleep. Bring me a list of streets that have trees. The city has many. I want to remember them from here.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I said. \"I'll bring you a list.\" She smiled like a lit match.\n\nOutside, night had become a glaze of rain over cars that could not be bothered to shine. I walked home with the lemon-yellow kettle singing in my head. The flat was more empty than it should have been, even with my father and Alba\u2019s mother making tea, their voices careful and bent. I told them what they wanted to hear: that she was better, that the nurse liked her, that the window had a view of a tree. They clung to those facts as if they were handholds on a cliff. Later, when their room was silent and the city yawned and rearranged itself, I wrote a list of tree streets. Calle del Rosal. Avenida de Galicia. The little square by the pastry shop where the plane trees pretend to be flocks of sheep. I fell asleep with the list under my hand.\n\nDays do what they do best: they pass. Alba slept; she woke; she made friends with a volunteer who played guitar on Tuesdays and a nurse with a tattoo of a key behind her ear and a boy with a broken arm who wanted to know every story an adult carries but never offers to boys in casts. She sent me messages that were sometimes misspelled and sometimes sublime.\n\nThey have a banana pudding machine here, she wrote. It is like a miracle glued to a plug.\n\nYou would like nurse Ana, she wrote. She says words like \"spectacular\" about small things, and then she does not retract.\n\nCarmen says hello. She brought me a play with a character who only speaks in questions. Do you imagine what that would be like? Are you exhausted yet, just thinking about it?\n\nI imagined it. I was exhausted. I was also incandescent with the kind of jealousy that has no place beside a blood pressure cuff. The hospital had become a city of its own, with its own weather and customs, and she had begun to live in it with a grace that made me proud and furious. What is the opposite of loneliness? It is not company. It is being needed. I was less needed. That is good, you will tell me. That is exactly the thing you want when someone you love is ill: you want the illness to release its teeth. I know. I know. But the human heart has a perverse engine. Ask anybody.\n\nI went to my classes. I turned in an essay that argued that the word \"stone\" has different weights depending on who carries it. It was not my best work. I talked to Mara in the cafeteria and she looked at my face the way doctors look at X-rays.\n\n\"You should say something,\" she said.\n\n\"Say what? 'Hi, I have fallen in love with my step-sister, and also she has the flu, which is a terrible plot for a student film.'\"\n\n\"Say that,\" she said. \"To me, for starters, you idiot.\"\n\nI looked at my hands. I had always liked my hands: competent, almost pretty, capable of balancing coffee mugs and sentences. They looked untrustworthy now, like tools left in the rain. \"It will pass,\" I said.\n\n\"Which part?\"\n\n\"The feeling. The flu. Both. Neither. Shut up.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" she said, and then she did me the kindness of changing the subject to a professor we both hated because he smiled when he said sadism-adjacent things. I loved her for that.\n\nIn the evening, I took Alba the list. She used her finger to trace the names as if feeling their bark through paper. Carmen sat on the windowsill in a position that would have broken an ordinary spine and read aloud from her play. The boy with the cast wandered in and listened and then wandered out when an orderly told him to. Nurse Ana leaned in, said \"Spectacular,\" and left. The room had become a crossroads where stories paused, exchanged glances, went on. I hovered like a lamp. I offered water. I touched Alba\u2019s forehead with the back of my hand and made a joke about my medical degree. She laughed and then coughed and then laughed again.\n\n\"You're getting better,\" I said, but I meant, You are moving away from me into a space I do not own.\n\n\"Am I?\" she said. \"I feel like a page in a book somebody else is writing. Oh\u2014Carmen, read the part where the question-woman asks the mirror if this is her face or just practice.\"\n\nCarmen read it with too much feeling and it was perfect.\n\nLater, I walked home alone again. It is a short walk, but there are nights when it expands like a lung. The rain that night was careful. It kept to its lanes. My father had left me a note in the kitchen\u2014Went to get soup. How is she?\u2014and then three question marks that tried to look like flowers. I made tea. I sat at the table with my linguistics book open and did not see any words at all. I thought of Alba's smile at Carmen's reading. I thought of Carmen's hands drawing words in the air. I thought about how the human heart is a badly designed room: no exits, too many doors.\n\nIt would be too simple to say: that was when I started to break. It is never just one moment. It is a sequence of almosts. The glass of water you almost dropped. The call you almost answered. The word you almost said. The night I did break, I woke before dawn to a dream of the balcony and the cactus unfolding small white flowers that smelled like milk. I went to the window and watched the street shine under the new day\u2019s first thin brush. The city was briefly innocent. I felt the thing in me that had been holding together, despite itself, begin to unknit. Not a dramatic rending. A careful undoing, the way my grandmother used to take out the stitches of a sweater that had gone wrong because nobody had wanted to admit it.\n\nThat morning the hospital put up a sign about visitor limits and flu season. It had always been there in spirit; now it was there in blue letters. \"We need to reduce contact.\" Carmen sent me a message: They\u2019re saying fewer visitors, shorter times. Don\u2019t hate me. I\u2019m already here because of the ward next door. I can peek. Guilt is my superpower.\n\nI stared at my phone. Then I turned it off. Then on again. I went at the appointed time and they were strict at the desk. The nurse with the key tattoo put her hand on my arm. \"We'll make sure she's okay,\" she said. \"You can call at night; I can hold up the phone. She likes your lists. Bring another list. Of sounds.\"\n\n\"Of sounds,\" I echoed, because I am a very obedient person when given the right kinds of impossible tasks.\n\nI sat with Alba and made a list of sounds while the minutes shrank into their own copies. The kettle. The bus braking on the hill. The pigeons pretending to be applause. The neighbor who sings as if he lives under the ocean, everything bubbled. She added her own: the hospital\u2019s bottle of gel clicking, the paper curtain moving as if it were breathing, Carmen\u2019s laughter. We made a list that took us to the end of visiting hours. When the nurse said time, I had nothing to argue with. Not numbers, not God. I kissed the crown of her head, quick, light, not the way I wanted. She closed her eyes in a way that was an answer without language. Then she turned her face towards the window, towards the tree that insisted on its own leaves.\n\nI walked out under the sign that reminded me to clean my hands. I walked down the corridor that smelled like weak coffee and perseverance. I walked into a city that had decided it was November even if the calendar had not fully agreed. I walked home to a flat that had too much air in it and closed the door too gently. I looked at the record player and the bag at its side and pulled out the unmarked record with the crescent moon and set it on the platter and lowered the needle, the soft drop, the quiet crackle. Music began. It sounded like a dawn that could be delayed with the right word, if only I knew it.\n\nI did not know it.\n\nIt was in that stretch of days, close enough to the beginning to still be considered an introduction, that the future grew a hinge. I did not notice it. Hinges are like that: visible, unremarked, the reason doors open and close. If you want to know when doors are significant, you look at the metal that moves them. You listen for the hinge. But I was listening to a record, and rain, and the kettle singing its train song. I was watching a cactus for flowers.\n\nIn the hospital, Alba learned the names of night nurses\u2014Luc\u00eda, Jos\u00e9, a man called Nano who hummed under his breath\u2014and Carmen started a game where she collected the small lies hospital signs tell, like \u201cha ocurrido\u201d instead of \u201cest\u00e1 ocurriendo\u201d and \u201csilencio\u201d that nobody obeyed. She made Alba laugh until she coughed and then brought her water and apologized and did it again. The boy with the cast drew a picture of a ship that was really a bed with wheels and gave it to Alba and she taped it to the wall with medical tape because she had decided to live there, for now, and a wall without children's art is a wall that thinks too well of itself.\n\nI tried to carry on. But the city had shifted, its iron taste stronger in the rain, its pigeons more like confessions with wings. On the fourth night, I woke to the sound of a siren that did not fade. I sat up and waited for it to halve, then quarter, then silence. It did not. In the morning, the hospital called and said nothing alarming, and I exhaled in outrage at my own body for having held breath for hours. We adapt; we shatter; we adapt. There is a sequence there, and we move through it like dancers who pretend they invented the steps.\n\nWhen Alba was finally feverless for a day and then two, the rules did not bend but they stopped pressing on my sternum. I could stay a fraction longer. I could bring in oranges and peel them for her at the little table and the room smelled like something living. I could watch her sleep without doing the unkind math of what I might lose. It deserves to be remembered: those days existed. The ones before I let the hinge become a crack become a way into a different story. The ones before I moved toward that door and opened it with my bare hands.",

The city had rinsed itself overnight and stood there dripping, proud of its drainage. Buses breathed like animals that had just discovered lungs. The woman with the pigeons was already in position, her scarf knotted as if it had opinions about knots. I left the flat with a bag of oranges and a book I had no intention of reading, and I told myself this was an errand, humility itself, not a decision that would rearrange the furniture in my head. I was practicing lying to myself in the minor key.\n\nAt the hospital the blue sign about visitor limits had acquired a new strip of tape that made it look medically important, and the woman at the desk wore an expression that said she was tired of being the favorite aunt of bad news. I was a little early and a little ridiculous with my oranges and my book and my certainty that rules belonged to other people. Nano was at the end of the corridor, a roll of tape looped on his wrist and a pen tucked behind his ear like a cigarette from a different decade. He hummed something that could have been a lullaby or a football chant if you sped it up. When he saw me, he leaned against the wall as if it were an old friend and considered me the way a locksmith considers a key that looks wrong and might still open the door.\n\n\"You are early,\" he said, and there was a smile tucked inside the remark like a folded ticket.\n\n\"Only by the clock,\" I said, because I have never been able to resist an opportunity to be annoying. I lifted the bag. \"I brought oranges. They are innocent. They improve rooms.\"\n\n\"They stain sheets,\" he said, which was both true and beside the point. He gestured at the door. \"Two minutes. If a dragon sticks its head out of the ceiling tiles, you didn\u2019t see me.\"\n\n\"Never,\" I said, and he let me pass, which felt like walking into a small conspiracy that smelled faintly of antiseptic and forgiveness.\n\nAlba was asleep, her mouth slightly open in a way she would have edited out of any photograph. She had that hospital pallor that looks like it was painted on to match the walls, but the heat had left her forehead and taken its bright hammer with it. The tree outside insisted on being the kind of green that ignores weather. I put the bag on the table and sat and watched her breathe, and I thought about how breathing is a thing you do wrong as soon as you notice you are doing it. The book stayed closed. I do not know if oranges can improve rooms, but their smell can make even caution blink.\n\n\"Hey,\" she said after a minute that was more like ten, because hospital minutes are long trains that stop at every station. Her voice was made of dust motes and relief. \"Are we breaking laws?\"\n\n\"Only petty ones,\" I said. \"No dragons have objected.\"\n\n\"Good,\" she said, and she closed her eyes again and then opened them like someone stepping back into a doorway to ask one more question. \"What did the city do?\"\n\n\"It practiced,\" I said. \"It stretched its rain like a cat. The pigeons were early. The buses remembered their lines. Your mother sent a message made entirely of hearts and one tomato.\"\n\n\"Of course she did,\" she said, and that made both of us laugh softly in a way that did not wake the machines. I peeled an orange, careful to keep the peel in one piece, because sometimes useless skills are proof that you have a right to exist. I offered her a segment and she took it as if accepting a treaty. We ate in silence. The nurse with the key tattoo came in and said good morning in a voice that could have been poured over pancakes, checked numbers, declared them satisfying, and left the smell of coffee behind her like an afterthought.\n\n\"Are we allowed to eat?\" I asked, when the nurse was gone, because I needed to be corrected by a rule to feel real.\n\n\"No,\" Alba said. \"But oranges don't count. They are spherical permissions.\"\n\n\"That is not how it works,\" I said, and she smiled at me the way people smile when they agree and will not admit it. She looked at the window, at the tree that had become our third guest, and then at the bag by my feet. \"What is the book?\"\n\n\"A grammar,\" I said. \"Spanish morphosyntax. The kind of thing that makes time slow enough to be measured with a protractor.\"\n\n\"Read me a sentence,\" she said, and I obeyed, because I am very obedient when obeying gives me an excuse to be near her. I read about clitics and the particle se and the way language makes choices you didn't vote for. She closed her eyes and listened to me ruin everything beautiful about language and we were both comforted,, which is one of the strangest tricks of love, when it goes right.\n\nCarmen appeared in the doorway with a coffee cup and a stack of paper that might have been a script or a petition to abolish hospitals. She wore a sweater with holes that were either fashionable or sincere; with Carmen you could rarely tell. She saw me and stopped and raised the coffee in a gesture that was both salute and apology.\n\n\"They let you in early,\" she said. \"You must have bribed someone with oranges.\"\n\n\"Nano is susceptible,\" I said. \"He senses citrus and loses his ethics.\"\n\n\"Good to know,\" she said, and she stepped in, and the room did change in size, even if I would deny it. She put her coffee on the windowsill and touched the tape on the boy-with-cast's ship picture as if to test whether it was still attached, which I resented for no reason that I could explain. \"How are we?\"\n\n\"We are practicing breathing,\" Alba said. \"Tallulah just taught me that oranges are spherical permissions.\"\n\n\"Of course they are,\" Carmen said, delighting in a world where nonsense could be elevated to doctrine. \"I brought\u2014aha\u2014\" She shuffled through her pages and frowned. \"Well. I brought a monologue in which the character tries to remember a city only by listening to it. Perfect for your list of sounds.\"\n\n\"Perfect,\" Alba said. \"Read it.\"\n\nI sat there like a chair that had decided to have opinions. Carmen read, and she is very good at reading; her voice knows where sentences want to be held and where they want to be dropped. I watched Alba's face relax into that place it goes when somebody else carries her for a minute, and I wanted to be gracious enough to be only relieved. I was not. Jealousy is a hungry animal with soft paws; it sits on your lap and purrs and then, when you reach to pet it, it reminds you what claws can do. I said something kind, because I am good at kindness when anyone is listening, and then I left because the minute had turned back into a clock and Nano's dragon had probably returned, impatient.\n\nThere is a way to walk angry in a hospital and not frighten anybody, and I learned it that morning. You keep your face polite and your anger in your elbows. You stand at the hand gel dispensers and practice washing your hands like a saint being painted. You let the smell of orange and alcohol compete in your nose. You go outside and the rain taps you on the forehead and suggests you get over yourself. I walked to the university with the bag now light with the absence of oranges and with my book feeling like ballast, and I told myself the sentence I had been avoiding: You are not the only person with a voice she likes. I tried it in different accents. It did not improve.\n\nMara was in the cafeteria, stabbing a croissant with a fork like a tiny gladiator. She watched me approach and did a theatrical squint that Carmen would have appreciated. \"How's the miracle ward?\" she said. \"How is our architecture saint?\"\n\n\"Feverless,\" I said. \"They might release her tomorrow. Or the next day. She laughs at Carmen's jokes until she coughs.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Mara said, and she did not smile, because she understands me to an uncomfortable precision. \"And you laugh at Carmen's jokes until you want to punch something.\"\n\n\"I am not violent,\" I said, and then, because she is my friend and she has earned certain words, I added, \"I dislike how good she is at being human near Alba.\"\n\n\"Mm,\" Mara said, doing something devastating with three letters. She tore the croissant in half and handed me the bigger piece with the solemnity of a communion. \"You're going to have to be brave in one of two directions.\"\n\n\"Define,\" I said, even though definitions are what I do for sport.\n\n\"Tell Alba something true,\" she said, \"or tell yourself something true and then live like it. You can't keep pretending you are furniture. You'll get dusted.\"\n\n\"She is my step-sister,\" I said, and the word did its old coin trick in my mouth, refusing to be spent.\n\n\"Not yet,\" she said, because she is cruel and accurate. \"And even if she is, the heart does not get a family tree. It gets a map with certain roads closed and then it goes off-road anyway, breaking its shocks.\"\n\n\"I hate your metaphors,\" I said, and she patted my hand in a way that made me forgive her immediately. We ate, and we spoke of a professor who does not believe in commas except when he uses too many, and I went to a class where I learned nothing except that every language has a way to apologize too much, and then I texted my father to tell him I would bring home bread.\n\nAt home the kettle drew its whistle as if it were trying to command a train to stop under our window. Alba's mother had left a bouquet of parsley on the counter like a joke about flowers. My father was in the living room, scrolling through pictures of soup bowls, because his phone had learned to interpret his love in bowls. He showed me one with chickpeas that looked like small planets. \"I think we should make this when they call,\" he said, and I nodded and cut slices of bread as if they were decisions I had simply to divide into equal parts.\n\nWhen a phone buzzes on a counter in a kitchen and your hands are full, you make a choice about whether to wipe them or answer anyway and grease the glass. My phone buzzed and I wiped my hands and picked it up, and there was a message from a number I had not saved because I believe in certain kinds of restraint. Tallulah, it said. How are you. It was a city\u2019s name followed by a question, and it came from somewhere I had decided to colonize as absence. My mother does not write well, which is to say she writes like someone who has learned all her words by memorizing labels. I stared at it the way a person stares at a mirror when the light goes wrong.\n\nI put the phone face down and did not tell my father, because I am the kind of daughter who likes to protect him from nothing. Then I picked it up again and wrote, Fine. Oviedo rains. The iron is still in it. She wrote back, I will visit. The words arranged themselves like furniture I had not ordered. I stood there with the bread knife in my hand and imagined the rooms shifting: a chair that had belonged to one life placed inside another, a kettle wanting to whistle loud enough to drown anything that might follow.\n\nYou should know that I did not answer, and that not answering is a kind of answer. I made chickpeas with my father and he took a picture of the pot and sent it to Alba\u2019s mother, who was still at work, and she responded with enthusiastic punctuation. We ate and washed up and he went to bed with the economy of motion of a man who has learned that if he stops too suddenly he will shatter, and I stood in the hallway between our rooms and Alba's and listened to a silence that had lost one heartbeat. Then I opened her door.\n\nI told myself that I wanted to open the window, that the air must be stale, that I would water the cactus if it looked thirsty, because I am very good at inventing good reasons to do things I have already decided to do for bad reasons. The room smelled like her shampoo and the paper covers of books and the ghost of hospital disinfectant she had brought home on her skin the last time she showered here. The cactus held its nerve and its thorns and seemed unsuitable for pigeons and saints. I went to the window and touched the glass and saw my face and the chimney that believes in itself. Then I turned and looked at the things that had been arranged as if the person who had arranged them had left for an intermission.\n\nHer desk had a stack of sketchbooks, and the top one lay open, as if to make the choice easier. There are violins and knives and other instruments designed for very specific motions; there are also hands, which can be used to bless or to steal. Mine did both that night. I held the breath inside my chest as if I could trade it later, and I put my fingers on the edge of the book and turned the page.\n\nThere were roofs, as promised: slates curved like shoulders under rain, a cathedral\u2019s spire not even pretending to be subtle, balconies like tongues, gutters like secrets. There were annotations, not in architecture's stiff letters but in a script that danced in its own shoes. \"This building wants to lean,\" she had written next to a sketch of a street whose name I knew by the way it tastes when you say it. \"The corner cannot decide whether to be generous.\" On another page she had drawn the lemon-yellow kettle and made it look like a locomotive, added tiny windows, given it passengers. Beneath it: \"We live inside our need to boil. Trains of tea. Warnings of steam.\"\n\nI told myself that I was allowed to see these things because they were beautiful and because beauty seeks eyes. Then I turned to another page and saw Carmen, tilted in a chair with one leg on the windowsill and the other challenging gravity to a duel, her shaved hair and blue hair both documented with a fondness I felt in my throat. Beneath it, a note: \"Carmen reads a room as if it were a play. I do not know if that is healing or manipulation. Perhaps both. She makes even hospital light feel like a choice.\" I put my hand on the paper and felt nothing but paper, but I had expected my skin to find heat. I turned another page and saw me.\n\nIt was not a likeness I would have recognized if my name had not been written in the corner, and even then I might have lied to myself. She had drawn me from the side, from the kitchen, pouring coffee with my elbow held out like a wing, and she had made my mouth softer than it is and my forehead more stubborn. The note beneath it said, \"T pours coffee as if she were offering it to a river. Her fingers are always on the verge of music. Count her mercies. Count her bluntness. Count her lists.\" I did not cry. I went to the window and opened it a fraction, which was what I had promised myself, and the city exhaled into the room as if glad to be let in.\n\nI closed the book because any more would have burned me. I sat on the bed with my hands palm-up as if waiting for coins. My bare hands had done it, and a door that should have stayed closed had become a path. You will tell me it is not as bad as blood or theft or betrayal, and you will be right and wrong. It was a small wrong, the kind you can carry in the pocket of a life until it wears a hole and drops through. I stood and straightened the pillowcases as if that were penance, and then I did the thing that would be less forgivable: I drew my name on the back page of the sketchbook, very small, very far down, a signature of a person who does not get to sign. I do not know what I was thinking. I think I was thinking, If it ever matters, she will see I was here. If it never matters, paper will keep its secrets.\n\nThe next day they called to say she could come home. We went in with coats and scarves and the lemons of the kettle in our eyes, and the nurse with the key tattoo pronounced us ready for the world. \"The world is less sterile,\" she said, grinning, \"but more interesting.\" Ana hugged Alba in the manner of someone who pretends not to be a hugger and then takes your air and your bones into her own momentarily. Nano wheeled the bed down the corridor for the theater of it and then stopped, and we put Alba's bag on her lap, and we rode the elevator where someone had scratched a heart into the metal and the cleaning crew could not erase it. Carmen appeared at the doors with a scarf around her neck that looked like a spilled galaxy and said, \"Be free, citizen,\" and bowed in a way that she can get away with. Alba put her hand on Carmen's hand in return, and my jealousy did its familiar, absurd motion in my chest, like a cat stretching.\n\nWhen we got home, the cactus looked surprised, and the kettle made its speech, and my father practiced being casual and failing. We made chickpeas and the soup of an ordinary day and Alba's mother arrived with bread that looked too handsome to eat and immediately tore it, which is what love does to handsome things. We ate and talked about nothing except what was everything\u2014sleep, appetite, the tree outside the hospital window that would now have to inspire someone else\u2014and after dinner my father put a record on because he is not a man to be obvious but he could not resist the possibility that music would make the world say yes. He chose the Thelonious Monk because he is that kind of romantic: he remembers one detail and repeats it until it is either embarrassing or tender. The needle fell, the crackle spoke like rain on paper, and the piano did what pianos do when they have forgiven the people in the room.\n\nWe did not dance. I have seen films and I know what should have happened, but we did not dance because the living room is small and because there were four of us and because joy is sometimes a thing you hold still to hear. Alba leaned back on the sofa with the blanket on her knees and closed her eyes the way you close your eyes when you are learning to trust your eyelids again. Alba's mother held my father's hand for a minute and then let go, and he smiled at something that did not require words. I sat on the floor and leaned my shoulder against the sofa, and Alba's hand slid from the blanket to my shoulder and rested there, warm, a weight that adjusted what gravity meant. She left it there through one song and then another, and I wrote five possible meanings for it in the air and chose none, because choice is a luxury that requires courage I did not have.\n\nLater, the parents went to bed in the embarrassed way of new lovers with children in the next rooms, and the flat shrank to a corridor and two doors and the soft machine of the refrigerator forgiving us our electricity. I stood on the balcony and watched the chimney do nothing with conviction. The street made its small promises to the cats. I heard Alba's door open and close and her feet on the tile, and then she was beside me, the blanket around her shoulders, her hair pulled into a sort of event.\n\n\"It smells like rust,\" she said, inhaling as if to prove the city's consistency.\n\n\"It prides itself on that,\" I said. \"Oviedo and its iron perfume.\"\n\n\"I missed our kettle,\" she said, because it is possible to miss objects the way you miss gestures. \"In the hospital, even the hot water tastes like waiting rooms.\"\n\n\"They should bottle that,\" I said. \"Eau de Patience.\"\n\n\"Smells like oranges and gel,\" she said, and then she laughed and coughed and laughed again. I put my hand out of the blanket's reach and caught the air like a clumsy net. \"Thank you,\" she said, and the words went to a place in me that has been waiting for them since I learned to hear.\n\n\"For what?\" I asked, and the question sat there pretending to be casual while it bought property in my heartbeat.\n\n\"For the lists,\" she said. \"For the way you read grammar as if it were poetry. For the oranges. For not letting me apologize for being afraid.\"\n\n\"You don't have to apologize,\" I said, and I meant it and it made nothing easier. She leaned her shoulder against mine and we stood like that, two pieces of scaffolding pretending to be a monument.\n\n\"Want to hear something ridiculous?\" she said, after a while, and ridiculous is a word that can hide pain's shadow when it wants to. \"In the hospital, I started designing a building with corridors like this, narrow enough that people cannot pass without touching on purpose. It's bad architecture. It's beautiful.\"\n\n\"It would get terrible reviews from the fire department,\" I said, and she smiled.\n\n\"My professor would send me back to basic drawing,\" she said. \"But I think buildings should force us to risk awkwardness if we want to get anywhere. Otherwise we avoid one another indefinitely and then die.\"\n\n\"We could call it the Department of Necessary Closeness,\" I said. \"Admission by list. Or oranges.\"\n\n\"Or both,\" she said, and she looked at me with those eyes like lakes that once were storms, and I felt the hinge of the future creak, loud enough to make even the pigeons startle. It is one thing to open a door and read someone's handwriting; it is another to find them opening the same door from the other side, not to catch you, but to join you in the threshold.\n\nWe did not kiss. I am sorry if you required that. It would be simpler if I had that to confess. We stood there on a balcony facing nearly nothing and invented a building that would punish our cowardice and reward our better qualities, and then she yawned and I told her to sleep and she made a face because she hates imperatives unless she issues them. She went to her room and I stood there until the kettle felt neglected and then I made myself tea and took it to bed and read three sentences of a book and understood none.\n\nIn the morning she slept late because her body was still the owner of itself in a way nobody negotiates with. I went to class and the professor attached himself to a speech about definite articles as if it were a life raft. Mara and I walked out into a drizzle that had chosen to be more felt than seen. \"You are lighter,\" she said, because she is rude and honest and because my face is a betrayal.\n\n\"She is home,\" I said. \"She touches my shoulder when Monk is playing. My mother texted me and I ignored her.\"\n\n\"So,\" Mara said, filing it in the part of her brain that shelves disasters and recipes. \"All your ships have arrived at once. Try not to let them collide.\"\n\n\"Do you want to meet Carmen?\" I asked, because I am a masochist in small, controlled ways.\n\n\"I think I already know Carmen,\" she said. \"We have a dozen of her at the theater. They eat light bulbs and then smile. But yes. Fine. Introduce me to the enemy.\"\n\n\"She is not the enemy,\" I said, automatic, reflexive, reflexively dishonest.\n\n\"Who is, then?\" she asked, and I almost said \"my mother\" and did not, because some words feel like intercoms: too loud, too public, even just between two people on the steps of a building that pretends to be a castle.\n\nThat afternoon we went to the old bookstore on Calle San Francisco because the rain decided to aim itself sideways and there are places in the city that understand how to be shelter without commentary. The bookstore still leaned into its own shadow, and the man behind the counter had the same face he has had since my childhood: a map of disapproval with a country of secret tenderness where nobody vacations. Alba moved through the aisles like a person testing a new pair of lungs; she touched spines as if to see whether each book had been taught to behave. I picked up a book of photographs of Lisbon, because she had brought the poster, and she laughed and said, \"No, not nostalgia. Research.\" We bought nothing because poverty loves us, but we held nearly everything and then put it back gently, as if we had borrowed an organ for a minute and had decided not to keep it.\n\nWhen we came out, the rain had changed its mind, because weather is allowed to do that. We walked toward the university, toward this version of ourselves that made sense in daylight, and we saw Carmen on the steps of the theater building, sitting with her legs folded up like a piece of furniture someone had assembled without instructions. She waved with two hands because that is who she is. \"Citizens!\" she called, because that is what she calls everyone when she wants to pretend we are in a play that has cast us badly. \"I was just thinking\u2014oh. Hi.\"\n\n\"This is Mara,\" I said, because I had decided to be brave in the direction of reality. \"She thinks you eat light bulbs.\"\n\n\"I do,\" Carmen said. \"They are crunchy and full of ideas. Nice to meet you, Tallulah's sensibly skeptical friend. Does she tell you everything? No, of course she doesn't. Nobody tells everything. That would be impolite in a narrative.\"\n\nMara raised an eyebrow that has frightened two men and a professor into reconsidering themselves. \"I prefer my narratives without narrators,\" she said, and Carmen clapped as if someone had performed acrobatics in a slow-motion movie. We stood there and performed kindness for one another and I tried to ignore how my skin had learned the topography of jealousy.\n\nWe walked home in a cluster that pretended to be casual and stopped to buy eggs that would go missing because eggs always go missing in families. In the flat, Alba went to her room to draw, Carmen sprawled on our sofa like a citizen of the Republic of Sprawl, Mara sat at the table and I made tea because I am always making tea when I am not breaking into rooms. Carmen quoted lines from the monologue about listening to cities and forgot where a period should go and did not care. Mara told a story about a boy who had finally learned to say his own name without apologizing for it. Alba came back with a page where she had drawn the three of us as buildings: Carmen with windows too big for any proper fa\u00e7ade, Mara with a door that looked deceptively plain and locks drawn in filigree, me with a staircase on the outside that invited people to climb and hid the fact that it did not go to the top.\n\n\"That's cruel,\" I said, but I was smiling, because I recognized the truth even when the ink tried to disguise it as art. We hung the page on the kitchen wall with a magnet shaped like a lemon and pretended it was a joke, and after Carmen went home and Mara performed a goodbye that included a double eye-roll and a secret smile for me alone, Alba and I sat in the clean quiet that follows people who leave and you still like.\n\n\"You went into my room,\" she said, and it would have been less terrifying if she had accused me of arson.\n\n\"I\u2014\" I began, because beginnings are harder than endings, and then I stopped pretending. \"Yes. I opened the window,\" I said, which was true and not sufficient, \"and I saw the kettle train.\" I could feel my pulse in my throat like a small angry bird. \"I read the line about my fingers. And Carmen.\"\n\nShe did not look angry. She looked like the tree outside the hospital window, uncomplicatedly itself under weather. She took a breath and let it out and did not use the breath to injure me. \"Okay,\" she said, and the word was a small bed I had not expected to be offered. \"You could have asked.\"\n\n\"I didn't know how,\" I said, my voice trying to be a person and nearly succeeding. \"I am not good at that door. I pretend to be. I open doors and then apologize to them.\"\n\n\"I noticed the signature,\" she said, and her mouth quirked like a page deciding whether to curl. \"Very clandestine. Very villain-in-training.\"\n\n\"I am sorry,\" I said. \"I am an idiot.\"\n\n\"You are,\" she agreed, which is one of the kindest things anybody can do. \"But you are not boring. And you opened the window. The cactus will write you a thank-you letter.\"\n\n\"Do you want me to not look again?\" I asked, which was me learning just now how to be a person who asks instead of takes.\n\n\"I want you to look when I invite you,\" she said. \"Which is now. Sit. I'll show you the bad building. You'll laugh. The stairs do nothing. Like hope. Like rules.\"\n\nWe sat on the floor with the sketchbook between us and our knees almost touching and drew lines on paper that tried to be straight and failed honestly, and I understood, for a moment, the architecture of restraint: you draw a room and then you draw a window that refuses to be door-shaped, and you admit that some openings are only for looking. We did that for an hour that lasted the right amount of time, and when the kettle whistled its train, we let it, and when the rain tapped, we let it, and when my phone buzzed with a number that would always be a city, I turned it face down again and told the part of me that is eleven years old and has excellent memory to wait a little longer.\n\nOn the weekend we took the list of tree streets and walked them like a pilgrimage for a childish religion, which is to say sincerely, with snacks. We named their leaves as if that could make them love us, and we paused under the plane trees in the square where the pigeons graduates go, and we watched a couple argue, first with hands and then with faces, and then with kisses issued like traffic fines. Alba tilted her head back and watched the canopy as if it were a ceiling fresco, and I watched her watching things I had seen too often to see again, and I thought, calmly and with no hope of remedy, that my map had changed and no amount of erasing would make the old roads reappear.\n\nThere were no dragons in the ceiling, though Nano would have obliged if asked. There were only days, doing their trick: passing and building, passing and building, uncertain which building they were making.",

                              "content": "Chapter 4 began like a rehearsal no one had agreed to attend, the kind where you show up in your normal clothes and someone presses a feathered hat into your hands and says, Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll know your lines when the lights go up. The city pretended at an early spring and failed charmingly; the air had the same iron shavings as always, but the light was a fraction wider, and the pigeons performed optimism with their chests out. In our flat the kettle staged its usual coup at eight, and the radio told us there would be traffic by the football stadium, and my father cleared his throat twice before he said, without looking at me, \u201cWe have the registry today. Twelve-thirty. You\u2019re coming?\u201d\n\nI said yes because what else does a person say when the state intends to stamp your family into a single object. On the balcony a shirt had been left overnight and collected the weather like gossip; I unpinned it and folded it and thought about paper that remembers where it has been creased. Alba came out of her room in a dress that could have been blue or black depending on the weather\u2019s opinion, and she put on shoes that made a sound like a polite argument on the tile. She was pale still, the hospital having taken a layer of bravado from her cheeks, but her eyes were the same, those careful lakes that pretend they have never flooded. She looked at me and tilted her head and said, \u201cWe should bring something. Lemons for luck?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have three,\u201d I said, opening the fruit bowl and counting the small planets of our domestic galaxy. \u201cThe registry will love that. They have a box for citrus, next to the box where they put your sighs.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d she said, and she slipped the lemons into her bag as if smuggling into a movie theater, which perhaps we were. Alba\u2019s mother came out in a scarf that asserted a position on green, and my father put on a jacket that used to belong to his hope. The four of us walked to the registry office because it is close enough to make walking feel like a moral position. The woman with the pigeons nodded at us as if we were a procession that had finally learned its steps. The buses coughed their white flags and moved on.\n\nThe registry office had decided to be cheerful by means of ferns that were barely alive and chairs that stacked into good intentions. The walls were the beige of paper you don\u2019t choose. There was a bouquet on the counter that had been given up by its first recipient and adopted by the State. The clerk had a face that made you want to remember your own name. \u201cNext,\u201d she said, as if this were a continuation and not a beginning, and my father produced documents that contained all his careful mistakes. He and Alba\u2019s mother signed with an ink that pretended to be permanent. The clerk stamped with the gravity of rain. When she pushed the paper back through the slot, something in the room exhaled.\n\n\u201cCongratulations,\u201d she said, without looking up, and there it was, the word that refuses to examine its own assumptions. We smiled and performed the ritual kissing of cheeks and avoided knocking over a fern. A little boy in a sweater shaped like a dinosaur roared so convincingly that the old man beside him smiled despite himself. Alba put one of the lemons on the windowsill and then, when the clerk frowned, removed it and put it back in her bag, whispering to it, \u201cSorry, bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nOn the street again, parcels of sunlight laid themselves on people\u2019s shoulders as if to mark them for delivery to a better place, and the cathedral pretended it had never been a hiding place for prayers that went unheard. My phone vibrated against my ribs like a trapped bee, and I let it because I am the kind of person who believes a beep can be negotiated with. Alba\u2019s mother broke away to call her sister, the one who collects recipes like trophies, and my father looked at the paper as if it might speak in my mother\u2019s voice and say anything that would make the past a different country. Alba and I walked half a step behind them, the lemons heavy with their unspent miracles, and she said, in the tone of someone remarking on architecture, \u201cSo. Steps. Stepping. Step.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t love the word,\u201d I said. \u201cIt makes it sound like we\u2019re always one off.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are,\u201d she said, and for a second neither of us pretended otherwise.\n\nWe celebrated the way poor saints do: with coffee and a pastry we cut into careful quarters at a caf\u00e9 that never changes the brand of sugar packets. My father took a photograph of our cups as if to post proof that warmth had happened. Alba\u2019s mother asked me if I would come to dinner at her sister\u2019s on Sunday and I said yes before my throat could stage a rebellion. The radio in the caf\u00e9 was playing a song that had been trapped in the walls since the nineties and had finally gnawed its way out. Alba leaned across the table and brushed a crumb off my sleeve and I thought about how small mercies are never small to bodies that need any.\n\nAfter coffee I walked her to the School of Architecture because she had a pin-up, a small critique for a small project with a professor who enjoys being the kind of kind that hurts a little. \u201cDon\u2019t stay,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll get bored, and then you\u2019ll write a paper in your head about how critique is just a dialect of cruelty, and then you\u2019ll be mad at yourself for being right.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a connoisseur of being right at the wrong time,\u201d I said, and stayed anyway, because sometimes boredom is a kind of worship. The studio was a white room that had given up on warmth and settled for the religion of light. Students pinned their pages to the cork wall with the solemnity of people who aren\u2019t sure whether they\u2019re offering their work up for sacrifice or marriage. Alba\u2019s page had the building we\u2019d half-joked into existence: the narrow corridors that refused to let strangers pass as strangers, the stairs that went elsewhere on purpose, the rooms that asked questions on their thresholds. She had drawn small people in pencil, and one of them looked suspiciously like me, hands held out as if to measure a doorway\u2019s intentions.\n\nThe professor, a woman with hair like a storm cloud that had earned its electricity, stood back and squinted at the plan. \u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible,\u201d she said, and my ribs prepared to defend someone who did not need me as a shield. \u201cAnd brave. It has the arrogance of youth and the humility of a person who actually looks at how people touch. Your corridors will terrify fire inspectors and make families confess things. I\u2019m not sure which scares me more. How would you ventilate the middle?\u201d\n\n\u201cSkylights,\u201d Alba said, not blinking. \u201cCourtyards that are excuses for trees. If you force nearness, you must remove heat.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d the professor said. \u201cAnd your stairs that go nowhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cPractice,\u201d Alba said. \u201cFor all the ways we go nowhere on purpose before we go somewhere we can bear. Let them exist. People will sit on them. They will talk to people they would have avoided.\u201d\n\nThe professor smiled the way clouds sometimes part just enough to prove the sun still knows the choreography. \u201cYou are intolerable,\u201d she said, and pinned a small yellow sticky note on the page that said, in a quick hand, Keep this wrongness. Use it well. The other students pretended not to be taking notes on courage. I stood in the back, learning nothing about syntax and everything about desire pretending to be theory, and when Alba\u2019s eyes found mine, I did not hide how proud I was in case I would need that visibility later as currency.\n\nOutside the studio, Alba let out a breath she had been saving since morning. \u201cI thought she would set it on fire,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cShe did,\u201d I said. \u201cNow it\u2019s yours and brighter.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome with me to the theater,\u201d she said, and the shift made sense in her mouth; she had moved from rooms where walls speak to rooms where voices pretend to be walls. \u201cCarmen has a rehearsal. They\u2019re using hospital curtains as a set. She wants to show me how not to be solemn about illness.\u201d\n\nWe went because afternoons are for infidelity to whatever you said you would do at noon. The theater building smelled like old wood and new sweat. Carmen met us in the lobby wearing a sweater the color of a bruise you can\u2019t explain easily, and she spun once in the middle of the floor because bodies like hers cannot stay still when they have been given an audience. \u201cCitizens,\u201d she said, and then, because she had noticed the paper under Alba\u2019s arm, \u201cAh, the House of Necessary Closeness. Bring it to my monologues. We will let the chairs be cruel, so the words can be kind.\u201d\n\nThey rehearsed on a stage framed by curtains that did look like the hospital\u2019s, pale green that believes it is calming and is often a lie. The director had the voice of a person who has misplaced sleep and refuses to file a missing persons report. Carmen read a scene where her character asks a nurse whether her heart is a prop or the real thing, and the nurse says, You are the only one who can tell by the way you fall, and it wasn\u2019t good theater yet, but it was honest rehearsal. Alba watched with her hand over her mouth, an instinct I recognized from the hospital when she had hidden laughter from a fever. I stood in the dark with my arms crossed like a parenthesis that did not know what it contained.\n\nOn the bus home my phone buzzed again with my mother\u2019s city pressed into the digits. This time she did not ask a question; she announced herself as if she were luggage: I have tickets. Friday. I will be in Oviedo at four. Please. I read it twice to make sure the word please belonged to her and not to my invention. I did not answer. I could feel the answer inside my mouth, a coin that had lost its country. When we climbed the stairs, the building\u2019s handrail cool and indifferent under my palm, I told my father because lying would have required a speech I had not rehearsed. He put his hand on the counter, flat, as if feeling for tremors, and said the words he uses when the freezer argues with him: \u201cOkay. We will deal with that when it arrives.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want me to tell her not to come?\u201d I asked, and hated how the word want made his face briefly blank, a screen waiting for the wrong film.\n\n\u201cI want you to be less alone,\u201d he said, softly, and I had to leave the room to stop him having to see my face turn into evidence.\n\nThe day of the arrival built itself like scaffolding that shrieks when you put too much weight on one side. I went to classes and learned how Spanish absorbs blame into passive constructions with a disingenuous shrug. Alba sent me a picture of a courtyard she had found behind a caf\u00e9, a rectangle of mild light with a potted orange tree pretending to be necessary, and I sent her back a picture of the staircase in the humanities building where someone had taped an apology to the wall for no obvious reason: Perdonen el polvo de las obras, a phrase that always makes me think of the dust we cannot see. At lunch, Mara tucked her legs under her on the bench and listened to me read my mother\u2019s message with the flat affect of a person tasting a medicine before deciding whether to take it.\n\n\u201cDo you have a plan?\u201d she asked, tearing her sandwich into democratic pieces.\n\n\u201cThe opposite,\u201d I said. \u201cI have impulses. Fleeing. Hiding. Standing in a doorway and drafting a treaty.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t get a treaty,\u201d Mara said, not unkindly. \u201cShe gets a map. With warning signs. You make them big and legible. You can draw, can\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can list,\u201d I said. \u201cMaps of lists. Lists that map. Items like landmarks: the bookstore that leaned when you left, the kettle that refused to stop, the fact of me being eleven and learning that absence can sit at a table and eat bread with you and not choke.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cTell her you\u2019ll meet her somewhere that is not your kitchen. Make the first conversation belong to the street. Keep it moving. Don\u2019t ask questions you\u2019re not ready to absorb.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsorb is a cruel verb,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cIt is also a function,\u201d she said, and kissed my forehead like an older sister I never had, which made me want to both cry and salt the earth of the cafeteria.\n\nI texted my mother an hour before the train would get in and told her to meet me by the statue of the man who pretends the city is his. I used words that weighed less than my heart wanted them to. The train arrived. The station breathed its tired metal breath. The plaza around the statue had decided to be a stage for umbrellas. I stood there and put my hands in my pockets and took them out and put them back in and thought about the difference between mercy and method. When she appeared, she was both the same and wrong. The haircut that had been her only indulgence had grown out; the coat that had signaled her belief in big cities had resigned itself to our smaller one; the face that used to move like weather had learned to hold a shape and keep it.\n\n\u201cT,\u201d she said, and I had prepared for the wrong voice. It was lower, or maybe my memory had been too high-pitched. She did not reach for me, and I was grateful. We stood in a greeting that could have been mistaken for waiting for the light to change. \u201cYou look like your father,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd like yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look like Madrid,\u201d I said, because insult and compliment have always flirted in our mouths. We began to walk because walking gives you the alibi of traffic. She told me about a temp job that expected her to be grateful for time; I told her about linguistics as if it were the study of excuses; she nodded as if I had offered her soup. We paused under the awning of a bar where chalk letters promised a calamari that would forgive your life; she smiled at the sign and said, \u201cAsturias,\u201d like a tourist who had had her throat cleared by nostalgia.\n\nWe did not mention leaving. We did not mention eleven. We did not mention the city she had avoided in her mouth. I told her about my father\u2019s registry office and she said, \u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d and I believed her a fraction. She asked after my work in the tone of someone asking the weather about its plans for Friday, and then, as we approached the cathedral, she said, \u201cCan I\u2014can I see where you live?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, not loudly, not cruelly. \u201cNot yet.\u201d It took both of us a second to reassemble our faces. She nodded. The square noticed the rain decide to fall like a sentence that had been held back too long. \u201cAnother time,\u201d she said. \u201cA coffee then? Inside? You look cold.\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t, but I wanted to be somewhere that had walls that did not know my father\u2019s name. We went into a caf\u00e9 that likes to be dim even at noon. The waitress had forearms that could carry three tables and the kind of joke that nurses tell at three a.m. We sat at a small table near the window and watched umbrellas fail at being boats. We had coffee. We spoke of how the trains lately had begun to act like moody relatives. She asked, too carefully, \u201cDo you need anything?\u201d and I almost laughed, because the list unfurled across my brain like a dropped ribbon that knows how to tie itself. I said no. She asked about music as if I still held onto the version of me that tried to learn Monk by osmosis; I said there was a record player now and resisted the urge to talk about crescents drawn on labels. She said, \u201cI can stay a few days,\u201d and I said, \u201cOkay,\u201d as if okay were a country with immigration control.\n\nWhen we parted, she touched my sleeve, not to hold me, but as if to check whether I was in focus. \u201cI\u2019ll text you,\u201d she said, and I did not tell her not to. I walked home with the city pretending to be a map and my legs pretending to be sure of the route. The flat was full of the smell of onions turning polite in oil. My father was chopping parsley with the concentration of a man who would do anything to replace one image in his mind with another. Alba\u2019s mother kissed my forehead and called me valiente like a word she would argue with if she had the time, and Alba turned from the stove with the wooden spoon like a wand and said, \u201cWell?\u201d with her eyebrows.\n\nI told the story without adjectives and they nodded in the way people do when they have agreed not to make new weather. After dinner, when the parents went to bed in their soft, embarrassed way, Alba and I sat at the kitchen table with the sketchbook between us like a treaty that made art of its clauses. She drew a corridor that got wider and then narrowed again, an apology and a dare. \u201cYour mother,\u201d she said, not a question.\n\n\u201cShe arrived,\u201d I said. \u201cShe knows how to wear the word please now. We weren\u2019t unkind. We weren\u2019t anything brave, either.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were a person,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s hard enough.\u201d She shaded a stair so it looked like the beginning of a secret. \u201cWill she come here?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cNot yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want her to?\u201d she asked, and I thought about the kettle, about my father\u2019s jacket, about the lemon magnet holding up the drawing of the three buildings we pretended to be. I thought about Carmen\u2019s stage and the hospital curtains and the boy\u2019s ship, and I said, \u201cI want a world where the answer to that is simple.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can build corridors that force kindness,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the doors still decide who they let in.\u201d She closed the sketchbook and put her palm on it as if stopping a small animal from running into traffic. \u201cLet\u2019s be stupid and go to that jam on Wednesday. You can pretend to love Monk again, and I will admit that I like him more than I thought.\u201d\n\nThe jam on Wednesday was like every jam on Wednesday except when it wasn\u2019t. The bar\u2019s wood had absorbed decades of spilled courage; the lampshades were still the color of nicotine and forgiveness. A trumpet player in a jacket that had seen too many winters found a note that made one of the bottles on the shelf hum in sympathy. Alba sipped her ginger ale like a counsel who didn\u2019t want to weaken her case. Carmen breezed in half an hour late with a scarf that had decided it was a comet, and she pulled a chair with the confidence of a person who can make furniture forgive her. \u201cI could have used your corridors today,\u201d she said to Alba. \u201cSomebody cried in the dressing room and then we all pretended not to notice for eight minutes and then we noticed for eight minutes too long.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow was the nurse line?\u201d I asked, because I had liked it at rehearsal against my will.\n\n\u201cI delivered it as if I believed in it and nobody laughed at the wrong place,\u201d she said. \u201cProgress. Mara is here.\u201d She waved at the door, where Mara stood with an expression that said, of course, there will be jazz now. They collided in hellos that managed to be sincere and slightly competitive, and I sat there and let the music arrange my breathing into new shapes.\n\nTo prove that I can surprise myself, I stood when the pianist looked around the room like a man in search of a dare, and I went to the small stage with the microphone that had never liked me. My hands were cold with the knowledge of where they have been and where they wanted to be, and my mouth wanted to bargain, but I said the poem I had not meant to say, the one about iron rain and bus brakes and pigeons that know the hours of the human soul, and it did not sound like Monk because I am not a piano, but it was honest in the way that leaves are honest when they fall. Alba\u2019s face did not move into that expression people wear when they are proud and want credit for it; she looked at me as if this had always been an option I had forgotten to exercise. Carmen put a hand to her heart in exaggerated gratitude. Mara raised her glass and did not make it a joke.\n\nWhen we got home, the stairwell smelled like somebody had cooked something with too much garlic and no apologies, which felt like a blessing. In the kitchen, the light over the stove flickered in the way that suggests it is practicing dying, and I stood on the counter to unscrew the bulb and because I wanted to prove my usefulness to gravity. \u201cDon\u2019t fall,\u201d Alba said, in the tone of a general who has learned to issue orders in the form of kindness. I didn\u2019t. We drank a tea too late for sleep and stood by the window and watched the night perform itself correctly. My phone vibrated again and I let it because my hands were busy with a mug and because I had promised myself not to be the person who always answers the person who always left.\n\nMy mother wrote, The city is beautiful at night. She wrote, I walked past your school. She wrote, I am sorry in the way that does not ask to be believed, only to be heard. I put the phone down and did not look at Alba, and she spared me by looking at the kettle as if it were a god we didn\u2019t believe in but sacrificed to anyway.\n\nThursday turned itself into a performance of being fine. I went to class and argued with a boy who said that words do not mean until someone wills them to; I told him that words carry past owners in their seams, and he said yes as if I had just announced that chairs remember thighs. Alba spent the morning in the studio building a model out of cardboard that complained; her hands came home with glue on them like small bandages. Carmen texted a picture of the hospital curtain under stage lights and it did look like it had something to confess. My father worked late because happiness makes him shy and work does not, and Alba\u2019s mother made soup that tasted like a decision.\n\nFriday arrived with the self-importance of a person who believes in calendars. My mother asked to meet again; I said okay because no one has ever died of okay, which is a lie, but one I told myself for sport. We walked by the river that pretends to be serious and isn\u2019t, and she told me about a friend who had become ill and recovered, and I told her about Alba\u2019s hospital and how the windows that face parking lots can still contain trees. She did not ask about Alba in the way that would have forced me to draw a map; she asked like a person who remembers that step-sister is a word you wear until it either fits or tears you. When we came to the bridge that thinks it is an eyebrow, she stopped and looked downstream and said, \u201cI should have stayed,\u201d and for a second I saw her at our kitchen table with the lemon magnet and the kettle pretending to be a locomotive, and I was angry because a sentence can be true and arrive too late to save anyone.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d I said, and the words were not a slap, but they knew where her face was. She nodded. We turned back toward the station because promises to ourselves are important even when they are about leaving. We said goodbye without arrangements; she touched the sleeve of my coat again and it did not feel like a claim. In the afternoon I put my head down on my desk and let the wood tell me its version of events. The cactus on the sill had produced a bud so small it could have been a trick of the light.\n\nThat night the power went out for the whole block with the drama of an opera that had been waiting for its cue. The refrigerator sighed and stopped pretending it was necessary; the record player went still; the kettle, bless it, kept its godhood because gas doesn\u2019t bow to electricity. We lit the candles that people who don\u2019t believe in romance keep for blackouts, and the flat rearranged itself into a ship with rooms that glowed like small ports. My father did that thing where men bang the fuse box with a friendly fist; Alba\u2019s mother distributed blankets like medals. Alba and I sat on the floor with the sketchbook open to a page where she had drawn stairs that admitted defeat gracefully. In the dark the pencil made a sound like a moth on a window.\n\n\u201cTell me something true you haven\u2019t said out loud,\u201d she said, and the request landed like a gentle trauma. The candlelight performed its cruelty on our faces, revealing softnesses we had been hoarding.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I know the difference between wanting to be held and wanting to be seen,\u201d I said, and the sentence surprised me by being already formed when it left my mouth. She nodded as if this had been on her list of things about me that felt inevitable. The kettle chose that moment to sing, and we laughed in self-defense at the ways that drama chooses its cues.\n\n\u201cYour turn,\u201d I said, because fairness is one of my least fraudulent virtues.\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d she said, and shifted her shoulder against the cabinet, \u201cthat I came here to build rooms and found myself trying to build a person I could be in them. Le\u00f3n was a place where I was good at stairs. Oviedo is a place where I am practicing doors.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd?\u201d I said, because the candle had decided to burn like a witness.\n\n\u201cAnd I want you,\u201d she said, with that terrible generosity of leaving you to decide what the sentence means, \u201cin my buildings. In the ones that force kindness. On the stairs that are for sitting. In the rooms that only have windows, so we are forced to look.\u201d\n\nI did not kiss her. The power had gone out, but not my good sense or my fear. I put my hand flat on the sketchbook and felt the paper thin my pulse out into the room, and I said, \u201cI am here,\u201d which is a sentence that can hold more than it appears to. She put her hand over mine for the length of a candle\u2019s wobble and then took it away, not because she wanted to, but because we both were still the kind of people who believed in being able to sleep.\n\nThe power came back with a shrug and the refrigerator rejoiced in its whirr and the record player blinked its small light and pretended it had never been dead. We put a record on and it crackled back to itself and Monk played something that made the room decide to exhale, and my father came into the kitchen to say that the block had cheered at the sound of the football game returning to its screen next door, and Alba\u2019s mother smiled into her soup like a person who has finally registered her own victory. Later, in bed, I allowed my body to be tired and not just dramatic, and I dreamt that the cactus burst into flowers and that the pigeons delivered invitations in their beaks to a building with no doors at all.\n\nOn Sunday I went to Alba\u2019s aunt\u2019s apartment where there were nineteen people in a space meant for ten and everyone had decided to shout love at one another in two dialects. They served fabada that stood up for itself in the bowl; they insisted I eat as if they had sponsored my mouth. Alba\u2019s mother told the story of the registry and made it funnier than it had been because she can make forms into jokes; my father laughed the way men laugh when they have been forgiven and don\u2019t trust it yet. Alba\u2019s cousins asked me whether linguistics can make a person stop lying and I said no, only better at it. We went home with containers full of soup like luggage for the week, and the lemon magnet held up a new drawing of a window that had decided it was a question.\n\nFor a few days, the city pretended it had been easy all along. Classes behaved like themselves, which is to say inconsistent. The hospital receded into a story we could tell people when they needed proof that we had done winter properly. Carmen had her opening night and we sat in the eighth row and watched her wrestle with sentences the way you wrestle with a wet sheet, and she won more often than she lost, and afterward in the bar she told us that acting is just the art of being a person when too many people are watching. Mara rolled her eyes and bought her a beer. My mother texted me a picture from the train window of a field that had decided to be blank, and said, I will write, and I believed that the way you believe a liar when you want the night off from caution.\n\nLate in the week, I went to the bookstore on Calle San Francisco alone because the rain had decided to be made of needles and I wanted a shadow to lean into. The man behind the counter looked up as if expecting me to carry a catastrophe and was mildly disappointed that I had only brought dampness. I wandered the aisles and let the books breathe on me. In the corner where poetry pretends to be patient, I found a slim volume about doors in old cities, their measurements and myths, the thresholds where brides tripped and wolves chose not to enter, and there was a chapter on hinges that made me feel like someone had been eavesdropping on my private metaphors. I did not buy it because money is a language I do not speak fluently this month; I stood and read instead until the man behind the counter coughed in a way that suggested I should practice leaving.\n\nWhen I came out, the woman with the pigeons had taken shelter under the awning and the pigeons milled like guilty confessions at a public hearing. She nodded at me and said, \u201cThey follow food and weather, like anyone,\u201d and I nodded back as if she had granted me a doctorate in practical philosophy. At home, Alba was on the floor with the model, convincing a small wall to behave with a strip of tape. She looked up and the look landed on me as if I had walked into a sentence that had been waiting for me to finish it.\n\n\u201cWe need more glue,\u201d she said, pragmatic as oxygen. \u201cAnd a better fire plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe always need a better fire plan,\u201d I said, and then I sat down cross-legged on the floor and took the tape when she offered it and held the tiny corridor while she pressed it into obedience. The kettle announced time and we let it. The records had started to warp at the edges because we are not careful enough with heat; the Monk still played perfectly, as if certain wrongnesses are built to endure. When the phone rang later, it was not my mother and not a hospital and not any of the disasters I rehearse. It was a number I did not know that turned out to be the program coordinator for a small reading at the university caf\u00e9, asking if I would come and read the iron rain poem because someone had told her I had a mouth that could make buses sound like whales. I said yes because sometimes you say yes to something that is not the thing you want most in order to remember how yes feels.\n\nAnd on Friday, because weeks do not run out of ways to invent themselves, we were on the balcony in a drizzle that was more opinion than weather, and Alba said, \u201cDo you ever feel like a hinge?\u201d and I said, \u201cYes,\u201d and she said, \u201cGood. Then it\u2019s not just me,\u201d and the two of us stood there and moved nothing and held everything together for another day.",

                              "content": "Chapter 6 began like a door that had been painted shut and was suddenly asked to remember its purpose. The city woke under a glaze that wasn\u2019t rain so much as breath returned to glass, and the chimneys stood like exclamation points nobody had earned. In our flat the kettle tried to startle the morning into good behavior and the record player sat with its lid up as if listening for instructions. My father hummed a tune from a decade that never quite belonged to him and put his jacket on the chair in case he decided to leave, which is how he prepares for any day that might ask him to be different. Alba was already at the table with a pencil behind her ear and the model of the Building of Necessary Closeness half-assembled, its cardboard corridors arguing softly with the tape. She had made a tiny sign for the stair to nowhere that said, in letters you could only read if you were already in love with the idea, practice.\n\nShe looked up when I came in with the sleep still folded into my eyes and said, \u201cHow do you feel about microphones?\u201d The pencil fell forward from her ear like a decision.\n\n\u201cLike I feel about umbrellas,\u201d I said, reaching for the kettle and finding it too hot to touch. \u201cUseful, deceitful. They fail exactly when the weather is most itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said, and her smile had that slant it has when she knows she\u2019s being kind to my panic by pretending to joke with it. \u201cThe caf\u00e9 has one that was found in a broom closet and rescued. Carmen says it works like a dog with an opinion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can project,\u201d I said, more bravely than I felt. \u201cThe problem is not air. The problem is the ownership of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou read like you pour coffee,\u201d she said, and she wasn\u2019t teasing. \u201cAs if the river had been waiting to be invited into a cup. I\u2019ll be there. You can glare at me if the words try to leave the stage without permission.\u201d\n\nI thought about the poem I\u2019d said I would read and the one that had been busy building itself behind it, using bits of my day like scaffolding. The iron of the rain had chosen me as a faithful correspondent; the pigeons had become a chorus with a sense of humor; the corridors wanted to be a metaphor and a floor plan simultaneously. I buttered bread with the care of a novice surgeon, because breakfast is sometimes just a rehearsal for public acts. Alba cut an orange into eight precise segments and declared them tickets, and we ate them as if there would be a door somewhere later that would require proof of our citrus.\n\nThe university caf\u00e9 had taped the poster with my name spelled correctly and the month mislabeled, as if someone had negotiated with time and lost the small print. The window chalk announced happy hour for a coffee that could not remember its own smile. Inside, the chairs were pretending to be attentive and the lampshades hung at a degree that made me feel like I was already on stage. Carmen arrived too early with a scarf that had decided to be a dare and said, \u201cYou will be fine, and if not, I will stage a diversion by climbing onto a table and reciting the safety instructions from an airplane,\u201d which, terrifyingly, she would. Mara came with a notebook and a pen and the calm of a person who has volunteered to be my witness whether I fall or fly. My father texted a picture of a teacup from his desk as if to bless the event long-distance, and Alba\u2019s mother promised soup later as if broth were a language we all shared no matter what else we couldn\u2019t say.\n\nAn hour before the reading my phone pulsed with a message that landed like a hand laid too gently on my shoulder. I\u2019ll come if I may, my mother wrote, and there was a mercy in the conditional that I could not afford to examine for too long. I typed back a single word that is both door and barrier\u2014okay\u2014and felt it lodge in the architecture of my throat. I did not tell my father because I am good at triage when it concerns information; I told Alba and she touched her eyebrow the way she does when she\u2019s measuring a wall and said, \u201cWe will sit where we can see you and the exit,\u201d and I almost laughed from the relief of someone who understands how to design for floods.\n\nThe program began with a boy who announced he was \u201cmore into prose poetry actually,\u201d which meant he read a paragraph about the sea and a cinnamon roll as if they had broken up with him over the phone. A woman with a voice like rain on tin took the microphone and made it behave, and the room turned the volume of its breathing down to polite. Then the coordinator said my name and my name, when said into a microphone, felt like a word being asked whether it enjoys its own weather. I stood and the chair gave up the idea of me with a squeak that sounded like a hinge. Alba\u2019s eyes were where I needed them: steady, just to the left of the mic, a small lake that had decided to reflect only the necessary light. Carmen folded herself into enthusiasm beside her; Mara uncapped her pen and looked at me the way you look at a person who is about to cross a narrow bridge with their eyes open.\n\nI read the poem about iron and rain and the way buses inhale before they exhale us back into our weather, and people did the thing I had secretly hoped for and had pretended not to hope for: they leaned. The caf\u00e9\u2019s clatter consented to a half-minute of silence exactly when I described the woman who feeds pigeons as if they were a committee, and someone in the back made a sound that might have been an agreement. The microphone hummed once like a reluctant appliance and then decided to be good. I let the next poem arrive with its own feet; it had the corridors of Alba\u2019s building in it and the injunction against passing without touch, and it had a stair that stopped to invite conversation, and it had a door that had been painted shut, asked to remember, reminded gently that remembering is sometimes just not resisting. I said the word please and let it belong to both me and the person who had texted it. I did not look at the back of the room until that word had done its work.\n\nMy mother had chosen a place by the window where the glass collected the outside in pieces and tried to assemble a coherent weather. She was smaller than she had been two years ago, or my memory had inflated her to the size of her leaving. She leaned forward the way people do in caf\u00e9s when they are trying to remember how to belong, and when she saw me see her she did not smile so much as let the possibility of smile hover in the vicinity of her mouth. I kept reading because stopping would have been a betrayal of the air the room had already exchanged with me. I made my voice do the thing Alba had accused it of: being a blanket, being a talking handrail, being the particular kindness of a bridge.\n\nThe microphone chose the last line to go on strike and I finished without it, finding out that my ribs can be a drum if I ask them nicely. The applause landed like rain on paper and did not tear it. People came to tell me what my words had reminded them of, which is the ritual we perform to let the poet believe in the usefulness of their particular noise. Alba didn\u2019t come forward right away; she held her position at the edge, as if guarding the door that leads from one version of me to the next. Carmen hugged me with the generosity of a person who considers accolade a communal resource. Mara said, \u201cYou did not disgrace any trains,\u201d which, coming from her, is thunderous praise.\n\nMy mother did not approach until the wave had receded and I had put the microphone back in its stand as if returning a loaned instrument. She stood beside a table with a bowl of lemons that had no right to be there in a caf\u00e9, just as we had brought them to the registry office as if to annotate bureaucracy. \u201cT,\u201d she said, quietly, and I wondered briefly whether she had practiced the letter aloud in the train window to see if it still fit her mouth.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d I said, and when I did not drown, I thought about how sometimes survival is simply a matter of where you put your feet. We walked to a corner that had room for two people to be awkward without causing a structural failure. She said the poems had made her want to phone a city and apologize to it, which is exactly the kind of thing she would say when she wanted me to know she had been listening even if she did not know what to do with the information.\n\n\u201cThank you for coming,\u201d I said, because I have learned to hand out polite phrases as if they were life vests. \u201cI\u2019m meeting my family for dinner. We can\u2014tomorrow\u2014coffee somewhere that isn\u2019t a kitchen.\u201d\n\nShe nodded and didn\u2019t do the thing she might have done, which is to ask to bend that rule. \u201cI\u2019m staying near the station,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a caf\u00e9 that pretends to be Paris. Eleven?\u201d\n\n\u201cEleven,\u201d I said, and her face moved into gratitude so quickly it startled me into forgiving the word for all its losses. She didn\u2019t touch my arm this time, which made it easier to keep all my bones where they belonged. When she left, she did it like a person leaving a church quietly, borrowing the silence that wasn\u2019t hers and promising to return it.\n\nAt dinner my father poured soup as if accuracy were a second language he had recently decided to master. Alba\u2019s mother over-salted and then added a peeled potato the way her own mother had taught her, remedying and remembering in the same motion. Alba sat opposite me and made a circle in her bowl with the back of her spoon as if beginning a sketch in broth. We talked about the reading using only nouns and the jokes that live near nouns; we did not say mother, which felt like both a mercy and a cowardice. After, my father washed each bowl as if returning it to a calmer version of itself and went to his room with the deliberate gait of a man who will wait by a phone until sleep kills the lights.\n\nAlba and I took our tea to the balcony because the air had chosen to be honest about its chill. Below us a cat claimed a stretch of curb with the right born of repetition, and above us the chimney measured time with the absence of smoke. \u201cYou did that,\u201d she said, and I pretended not to know whether she meant the reading or the act of surviving my mother\u2019s presence. \u201cYou put verbs on things that thought they were nouns, and they didn\u2019t even get offended.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was less afraid when the microphone died,\u201d I said. \u201cWhich seems like a metaphor with ambitions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe always liked candles in blackouts,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy should this be different? Also, you pronounced se with more tenderness than is strictly necessary. Your professor would be charmed into correcting you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait until he hears my ode to the passive,\u201d I said, and she laughed quietly, a sound that has learned the difference between making light and being it. We stood without speaking for a minute that widened like a door that had finally remembered its hinges. She reached up to tuck hair behind her ear and her knuckles brushed my sleeve, and it felt like a bird landing on a branch it has been pretending not to look at. We let the moment sit between us on our balcony that faced almost nothing and we refused to name it because our names had been doing heavy labor all week.\n\nThe next morning I went to meet my mother at the caf\u00e9 that pretended to be Paris. The tables were mean to elbows and the croissants were ambitious without being arrogant. She wore the same coat as Friday, which meant she had decided not to spend on appearances what she might need for absences. We spoke like people who know how to keep a conversation from turning into a trap. She told me about a book club that had saved her from an apartment that made silence loud; I told her about a list of streets with trees and how the hospital window had hosted a leaf that insisted on a season. When she asked if I was happy, I told her the truth\u2019s cousin: that I had become more precise about what happiness is not.\n\nShe asked, as if asking to borrow sugar, if she might see me again before she went back, and I said yes on the condition of public benches and caf\u00e9s and the city as witness. She accepted the terms and did not pretend they weren\u2019t terms, which made it possible for me to keep breathing on a weekday. We parted with a handshake that both of us permitted to be a little absurd. The woman with the pigeons nodded at me as if to say, yes, today is a day you stood in the weather and did not invent new weather to replace it.\n\nBack home, the cactus had finally decided to be dramatic according to its own schedule. A bud had opened into a tentative white that looked like a small confession, and it did it in daylight to surprise us. Alba crouched to look at it closely, her hair falling forward like a curtain someone had decided not to shut all the way. \u201cThey do this once and then never again or once a year and pretend it costs them nothing,\u201d she said, and she did not touch the flower, which made me love her with a ferocity I hid by rearranging lemons.\n\nWe took the model to the studio for a review and watched it survive the elevator like a brave patient. The professor with storm-cloud hair came by and flicked a stair with her finger to see if it would admit its uselessness. \u201cYou still want to force people to brush past each other,\u201d she said, \u201cin a culture that prefers to pretend the walls are benevolent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to design for what we fear,\u201d Alba said, and the professor smiled in that way that meant she had been waiting for that answer and would not punish its predictability. \u201cI added a courtyard for air. I will affix small trees that will fall off if the glue refuses to believe in me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake the trees convincing enough that the fire inspector breathes differently,\u201d the professor said, and pinned a note onto the board: Don\u2019t apologize to the walls. After the review, Alba and I walked to the theater because Carmen had asked for arms to carry a prop wardrobe that had started to think it was a character. We found her arguing lovingly with a bolt of fabric, her hair a half-blue weather report. \u201cYou were good,\u201d she said to me, without overture, which told me someone had been in that caf\u00e9 who later told someone who later told her. \u201cYou made the room a corridor, and people touched, even if only with their faces.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou steal metaphors for breakfast,\u201d Mara said, appearing with a cup that announced a loyalty to bitter coffee. \u201cAlso, your curtain needs washing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like a curtain that looks like it remembers the last body that passed it,\u201d Carmen said, and they resumed their rivalry for the sovereignty of sentences. I let their talk move over me like a stage light and helped carry the wardrobe that had decided it wanted to know what the sun is.\n\nThat evening, the university caf\u00e9 messaged to ask if I might read again next month, this time with a theme that pretended to be about cities but was actually about being honest when the world is listening and you\u2019d prefer it looked away. I said yes without asking permission of my fear and then told it anyway, and it sulked briefly and then agreed to play along if I promised to over-prepare. At home my father had bought a cheap hinge and oil because the balcony door had been complaining in a voice we had decided was charming until it wasn\u2019t. I watched him unscrew and adjust, and the way the door swung after\u2014smoothly, without announcement\u2014felt like both a loss and a mercy. \u201cSometimes we need the squeak,\u201d I said, and he nodded as if I had offered him a memory he could put in his jacket pocket.\n\nLate, in the hour where the refrigerator thinks it is the only machine awake, Alba knocked on my door, not a performative tapping but the precise rhythm of permission. She stood with the sketchbook in her hands like a petition and came in when I said yes as if we had been practicing this choreography for months. \u201cI want to rewrite the corridor,\u201d she said, sitting on the floor, her back against my bed. \u201cThe narrowness should be generous. That sounds impossible, but so does weather that tastes like iron, and here we are.\u201d\n\nWe drew options and rejected them and tried again, and I made a list in the margin for her of all the moments I had felt the city require nearness: the bus stop when the rain had insisted, the registry office with its ferns, the hospital elevator, the aisle between poetry and theory at the bookstore on Calle San Francisco. She added her own: the stage wings, the distance between kettle and cup, the space where my name had been signed in her book and the paper hadn\u2019t protested. We laughed at the way we were both showoffs when nobody was watching, and we sat long enough that the night turned over and presented its other cheek.\n\n\u201cI should tell you something,\u201d I said, because Mara\u2019s voice lived in my brain as a benevolent bossy ghost. \u201cIt is not information so much as an orientation. When I am near you, I become precise in a way that makes the rest of my life both easier and impossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said, without triumph and without sorrow, and a small piece of me unclenched, the way hands do when they realize they will not be asked to carry their own weight forever. \u201cI am drawing stairs for us that are mostly for sitting. We can forgive whatever we cannot climb yet.\u201d\n\nWe did not kiss, which is not a vow of purity so much as an agreement with time. We sat there with graphite on our fingers and tea we had forgotten to drink going cold, and at some point our shoulders leaned until they were a single line that would be hard to draw without a ruler. When she left, she placed the sketchbook by my lamp and said, \u201cI am putting this here not because I don\u2019t trust my room but because I like the idea of these drawings sleeping under your breathing.\u201d When she closed the door, it did it without a squeak and I wasn\u2019t sure if that was a triumph or a failure I would learn to forgive.\n\nThe week folded itself like a map that remembers all the places your fingers pressed down. My mother, obedient to the rules I had asked for, wrote a message with a picture of a caf\u00e9 spoon and a line about trains that apologized twice and meant it once. My father bought lemons as if the fruit could guarantee the right kind of tartness to our days. Alba\u2019s mother learned how to make a stew from her sister\u2019s recipes without calling her for help and celebrated by inviting us all to eat it as if victory were a spice. Carmen\u2019s show extended its run by three nights and she walked around the city like a person who has found a door that finally recognized her as its own and opened on the first knock. Mara took my poem and put it in her notebook as if storing a friend\u2019s spare key.\n\nOn Thursday, the hospital called, but it was Nurse Ana inviting us to a volunteer recital that Nano had conned the ward into hosting. \u201cSpectacular,\u201d she said, and you could hear the grin in the word. \u201cBring your lists. The boy with the former cast wants to see if you\u2019ve learned new vocabulary for mischief.\u201d We went because saying yes to that building now felt like a way of honoring its stubborn intention to be a place where ends and beginnings share a wall. The ward smelled as it always had: oranges, gel, the soft tyranny of clean. The guitar volunteer was there, and a woman who looked like she had answered phones for a decade and then given the job her heart. Carmen recited a monologue from the play that had discovered its legs, and she did the nurse line without irony, and the real nurse who had given the line to fiction stood with her hand over her mouth struggling not to ruin her mascara. The boy drew me as a bus with wings and told me that this was how he imagined being released into a city. Alba stuck the drawing to the wall with medical tape and wrote under it in small letters, permission.\n\nWe walked out into a dusk that pretended it had invented itself just for us and turned at the corner where the vending machine now gave bananas that tasted like birth. Alba reached for my hand without ceremony when a motorbike roared too close to the curb, and I took it the way you take a tool you have already learned the weight of. We did not make it into a declaration, and we did not pretend it was nothing. We carried it to the bus stop and released it there because nearness is sometimes a public utility and sometimes a private altar, and the city was listening.\n\nWhen the rain returned, it did so in a thin script across windows and cheeks. I read again at the caf\u00e9 with the microphone that had learned to trust me, and a woman asked afterward whether the pigeons in my poems were metaphors or if I meant actual birds. \u201cBoth,\u201d I said, unable not to be myself, and she looked relieved, as if permission to believe two things at once had been withheld from her until now. My mother texted a photograph of a train ticket\u2019s underside for no reason I could parse and wrote, \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a month,\u201d and I did not write back until the next day because politeness is a tool and sometimes a weapon, and I am learning when to put my hands down.\n\nThe cactus chose, on a Tuesday at two in the morning, to open every bloom it had. Alba knocked on my door a more urgent rhythm and said, \u201cNow,\u201d and we stood in our socks near the windowsill and watched the flowers declare their foolish and perfect purpose. They smelled like milk and a decision postponed and finally made. We breathed like careful thieves, stealing what we were being given and promising to return it unharmed. \u201cThey\u2019ll close by noon,\u201d Alba said, her voice quiet with awe and regret. \u201cIt\u2019s all at once, and then they pretend they never did it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll make a list,\u201d I said, because I am not original when faced with miracles. \u201cThis, and the hospital courtyard light at four, and the sound of buses when they don\u2019t see you, and the way a hinge feels just before the oil decides to forgive it, and your professor\u2019s smile when you told her you wanted to design for what we fear, and my father\u2019s hands when he\u2019s trying to turn a lemon into evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will make a building,\u201d she said, \u201cwith a room that insists on blooming at unreasonable hours.\u201d We stood there until the flowers finished their sentence. When we finally slept, it was with the certainty that morning would pretend nothing had happened and that we would be brave enough to contradict it, gently.\n\nIn the afternoon, we hung the boy\u2019s drawing of the winged bus on our kitchen wall, below the lemon magnet, where it could learn the geography of our domestic weather. Alba added, in graphite, a tiny hinge in the corner of the page, not to be cute, but as a reminder of the quiet miracle that allows doorways to be both threshold and place to lean. I oiled the balcony\u2019s new hinge once because I am greedy for smoothness and then regretted it and learned to listen harder for the soft announcement of approach. The kettle, indifferent to metaphor, announced only itself and demanded we come make tea. We did, and the record player obliged the day with an old crackle and a piano that knows how to make a room exhale, and our family was a choreography that had learned more steps than it intended and performed them without falling.\n\nIf you ask me when the part of the story you\u2019re waiting for arrives, I can only tell you that we were already in it, that arrivals are sometimes just the moment you realize you haven\u2019t been waiting at all, you\u2019ve been walking. The city, in its iron and lemon wisdom, gave us what it gives everyone: weather and stairs and the option to hold onto the railing. We took it. We looked out, and in, and then we made another list, and then we put the list in the drawer with the spoons, because we believed in needing it again.",

                              "content": "Chapter 8 began on a day that believed itself to be ordinary and betrayed that belief by putting a small flag of light on the kitchen table where no window could have reached. The kettle staged its coup as usual; the radio measured traffic with its dry wrist; my father buttered toast with the concentration of a man who wants to keep disaster from hearing him eat. Alba had fallen asleep at the table over the model and woke with a cardboard triangle stuck to her cheek like a temporary tattoo. She peeled it off with dignity and set it on the stair to nowhere labeled practice, as if the model had been waiting overnight for an emblem. I made a list under my breath of rooms that deserve names and never get them\u2014the space between kettle whistle and cup, the three steps between a hospital bed and the window, the balcony where pigeons rehearse judgment\u2014and Alba listened the way a person listens to a weather report for a city she has not visited yet. I could tell from the set of her mouth that her professor had assigned something that required cruelty to be useful; I could tell from the way she tucked hair behind her ear that she was secretly excited to invent a solution nobody had thought to forbid. Carmen had sent a message at dawn that said, The curtain finally confessed. It smells like apology and I forgive it. Mara had sent one that said, You owe me two coffees for surviving last night\u2019s prose-poem boy, and attached a photograph of a croissant with a bite taken out that looked eerily like Oviedo\u2019s skyline. The city, outside our windows, did its exercise: buses expanding their lungs, rain stretching in thin bands between buildings, the woman with the pigeons deploying slices of stale baguette like treaties.\n\nI went to a morning class where the professor discussed clitic doubling as if it were a cousin who had moved in without asking and everyone had decided it was fine, and I learned nothing that would help me in the corridor between my door and Alba\u2019s. On the way out, a flyer flapped against the bulletin board declaring a spring festival I had forgotten the city hosts every year, promising balloons that would look sad by afternoon and music that would not be embarrassed to be performed in daylight. I took one of the tear-off tabs because I am weak in the face of paper strips inviting me to be social, and I texted a picture to Alba with the caption Research into public corridors, and she sent back a pencil emoji and a lemon and a drawing of a staircase that looked like a party hat. My phone pulsed a text from my mother that I did not open for three minutes to see if my blood had learned patience; when I opened it, it said, I found a door in Madrid that reminded me of ours. It was painted shut. I had the urge to knock anyway. I stared at it until the letters looked like a language I had yet to study, then put the phone face down and told myself that images are not obligations. At home, the balcony hinge that my father had oiled moved like a dancer who had decided to be gracious, and for a moment I resented the absence of squeak because it meant I had lost another method for detecting approach.\n\nAlba had a site visit that afternoon to a half-abandoned factory on the edge of the city where rust and geometry had been negotiating for decades without a union. She asked if I wanted to come, not because she needed an extra set of eyes, but because she has learned that I relax in the presence of things that admit their age. The bus there breathed opinions out its windows and dropped us in a neighborhood that specialized in remembering better days without hating the present. The factory had the dignity of a horse that has decided not to run anymore but will still tolerate a hand on its neck. Alba led me through a hole in a fence made polite with a piece of wire so the cut wouldn\u2019t catch on coats; inside, the floor had gathered the dust of five kinds of work and decided not to distinguish. Light entered through broken panes as if embarrassed by the grandeur of its entrance, and weeds rehearsed their insistence in the cracks. Alba set her bag down on a concrete ledge as if claiming a desk and began to draw the negative space between columns. \u201cI love buildings that admit they have been used,\u201d she said, her pencil marking time. \u201cAnd I love the arrogance of a door that still believes it can open even when somebody painted it shut twenty years ago. It holds its hinge like a secret.\u201d I walked the perimeter counting windows that had lost a pane and kept their shape anyway and thought about how language announces itself even in silence: the way you feel the difference between empty and vacant, the way abandonment smells like a particular decade of floor cleaner. When I came back to her side, she had drawn a corridor that would run through the center of the factory like a spine, wide enough to let mothers with strollers and teenagers who needed to learn how to walk past one another without turning themselves to iron.\n\nWe took our research to the river because water is the bachelor apartment of our better ideas, and I sat on the low wall staring at the surface as if hoping for subtitles. Alba flipped the sketchbook closed after a minute, either to keep her lines from escaping or to spare them my weather. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of going to Le\u00f3n this weekend,\u201d she said, without a flourish, as if placing a mug on a table to test if the surface wobbled. \u201cThere\u2019s a library there with windows that remind you that glass is a form of patience, and my mother wants to return a casserole dish to an aunt who thinks food is a method of attack. Do you want to come and pretend to be objective about my old streets?\u201d The question put its hands in my pockets and waited for my coins. I wanted to say yes the way a person wants to sit on stairs that never end. I wanted to say no because going into her before felt like daring the present to identify itself. I said, \u201cIf the bus is cheap, and if Oviedo promises not to be jealous.\u201d She smiled that way she does when I build a cage for a bird and then leave the door open. \u201cIt will rain there too,\u201d she said. \u201cThe iron tastes different. You can take notes.\u201d We sat until the river decided to change season without telling anyone, and then we walked home through streets that had perfected the smell of damp cardboard and soup.\n\nAt the flat, a bouquet of parsley had once again pretended to be flowers on the counter, and my father left us a note propped against the kettle that said Dinner at seven and a half, please remind me to breathe and also to call the plumber about the sink that likes to be a lake. Alba\u2019s mother bustled in with a bag of oranges and a recipe she had written on the back of a bill because paper is democratic that way. The four of us performed the choreography that has become our religion: slicing, stirring, discussing the day as if it were a country we could hold between thumb and forefinger and examine for counterfeit. When we sat, my father said grace in the language of spoon placement and my name, and Alba\u2019s mother told us a story about her sister and a roast chicken that had nearly proposed marriage, and I watched Alba draw a door in her soup with her spoon and resist walking through. After, while the dishes considered their mortality in the sink, my phone hummed with my mother\u2019s persistence. This time the message was not a story but an explicit question: May I bring you something from Madrid that you cannot get there? Please say yes. I took the phone to the balcony and considered composing a list that would punish and forgive simultaneously\u2014things like patience, absence that doesn\u2019t announce itself, a night that ends when it should\u2014but lists are my tools, not my weapons, and I refused to blunt them against our old stone. I wrote back, Bring me a notebook with strong paper. And a pen that doesn\u2019t run. The ones that can take ink like a sky takes weather. She sent a heart that looked embarrassed to be so pink and wrote, I can do that.\n\nThe spring festival arrived like someone\u2019s cousin who always suggests karaoke and then sings better than anyone expected. The square bloomed with stalls selling objects that should not have been beautiful and were: woven baskets the color of rainwater, cheap bracelets that would make the wrists of teenagers into declarations, a knife sharpener who whistled like a kettle whenever he found the edge. The woman with the pigeons had retired to a bench and allowed children to take her place; they deployed bread with a strategy that made the birds reconsider their politics. Alba and I wandered, making an architectural survey of temporary structures, and I argued for the genius of a tent that had no right angle to its name. Carmen found us with a pretzel the size of her head and a grin the size of the day and declared, \u201cYou have not lived until you have seen a mayor dance to a brass band without shame,\u201d and dragged us toward the stage where the city fathers and mothers performed their particular version of belonging. Mara joined with a paper cone of chestnuts that burned our fingers in a way that felt like a moral. We watched a clown convince a group of solemn eight-year-olds that their seriousness was a party hat in disguise, and we listened to a soap seller pitch his lathers with the patter of a man versed in repentance, and we let the afternoon be as long as it wanted to be.\n\nIt was almost virtuous, the amount of normalcy we performed, until Alba\u2019s mother noticed a woman across the square whose coat I had come to know too well at a distance. My mother stood near the lemonade stall, considering a jar of something that had been called honey by a person willing to commit to that lie, and she did not see us because her eyes were busy auditioning sweetness. My father\u2019s back went straight, the way it does when he is about to get through something by pretending nobody is looking. Alba\u2019s mother squeezed his forearm once and then put her hand around her cup of coffee as if it had asked to be held through a storm. \u201cDo you want to leave?\u201d Alba asked, softly, offering me the corridor out, offering to become the door. I looked at my mother\u2019s profile which is a sketch my muscles know how to flinch at, and I felt the precise weight of the pen she had promised, and I said, \u201cNo. We can let the square be big. It is allowed to contain her and us without collapsing.\u201d We stood our ground without pretending to be rooted, and my mother eventually looked up, saw us, and did not approach, which felt like a discipline I had not credited her with. She lifted the jar at me as if to ask, Do you believe in honey in this weather, and I lifted my paper cone of chestnuts and shrugged, and the conversation ended there without anyone losing skin.\n\nWe went to Le\u00f3n on Saturday under a sky that could not be bothered to choose a mood. The bus climbed past hills that had decided green was not a color but a manifesto, and Alba pointed out the derelict silos with more affection than derelict structures are used to. Le\u00f3n tasted like an old coin put under the tongue, copper and promise, and the streets remembered her in the way that streets do when a body has worn them properly. She took my hand without speeches when a crowd pressed us and let it go when the plaza widened, and in that space between I discovered an entirely new way to measure distance. We went to the library she loves and sat under windows that made the sky into geometric proofs; the room was full of that particular hush in which people dare silence to tell on them. Alba opened a book of buildings and showed me a staircase someone had made to be climbed only by the patient or the obsessive, and I took out the notebook my mother had given me at the station that morning, black cover, paper that promised to accept mistakes gracefully, and I wrote three sentences about the shape of a pause.\n\nWe ate in a cafe with chairs that insulted knees by being too low, and Alba drew a plan on a napkin for a courtyard with weather admitted on a schedule, and I drew next to it a list of words that change shape under pressure\u2014yet, perhaps, still\u2014and between us we made a place where strangers would be forced to confess their smallness and walk away taller. In the afternoon we visited her aunt with the casserole dish; the aunt was a person for whom hospitality was a sport and she had been training since the nineties. She looked me up and down with the efficiency of a customs agent and decided I could pass; she crushed almonds into a paste and insisted I learn the correct wrist for stirring, which apparently I have. She asked questions that treated us as if we were an old couple who had mislaid our wedding rings during a flood; we answered politely and inaccurately. On the bus back, Alba fell asleep with her head against the window, and I watched her reflection superimpose on farms and gas stations and late trains, and I thought about how the word step had failed to contain us from the start and how verbs are better than nouns for the weather we were in.\n\nBack in Oviedo, the week tried to revert to its template and failed because the template had been redrawn. I read again at the caf\u00e9 with the microphone that now leaned toward me like a dog amenable to instruction. My mother came and sat in the back and did not wave, and afterward she put a pen in my hand that was the kind of blue that lends itself to letters you regret and said, \u201cPaper is the only thing that forgives me,\u201d and I did not confess that I have preferred walls. My father and Alba\u2019s mother came on Thursday, the night I read the poem with the stair that refuses to go anywhere without telling you why, and their applause together made a new sound, a kind of domestic weather being recorded for the first time. Carmen brought three actors who heckled me lovingly with fingers snapped in rhythm and then bought me a beer with money they would regret spending on me in two days. Mara rolled her eyes when a boy recited a poem in which he was a wolf and the city was a forest that did not understand him, and then she kissed my cheek and said, \u201cYou are managing not to drown in a cup. I am proud of you,\u201d which is the kind of sentence that lasts for weeks.\n\nThe hinge you are waiting for squeaked in private first. It was late; rain had convinced itself it was necessary; the kettle had all but lost its voice from overuse. Alba and I sat at the kitchen table after the parents had gone to bed, the sketchbook between us like a treaty that also functioned as a mirror. She had put the Building of Necessary Closeness aside for the evening and was drawing faces without permission from their owners: my father thinking about nothing out loud for once, Carmen rehearsing with a whistle in her teeth, Mara preparing to destroy a boy\u2019s argument at fifty paces. She drew me last, a mercy and a cruelty, and when she finished a line and turned the book so it faced me, I felt the small click in my chest like a lock receiving the proper key. She had drawn my mouth as if it was carrying a confession and my collarbone as if it remembered a hand. Beneath, in small tidy letters, she had written, \u201cT gathers light like a misplacing and then returns it exact.\u201d\n\nI looked up, prepared to make a joke about possession and optics, and found her already looking. I have learned the weight of many looks; this one was calm enough to convince a cat to admit guilt. It did not demand; it did not request; it acknowledged. \u201cI am tired,\u201d she said, and smiled the way you smile when tired is a pronoun. \u201cBut not of you.\u201d She reached across the table and put her fingers lightly on my wrist, an angle that gave her plausible deniability if a parent appeared and also made my pulse behave like a small ridiculous horse. We sat that way long enough for the kettle to complain and for the rain to forget why it was here. Then she stood, and so did I, and the distance between standing and not standing turned out to be exactly the length of a hinge.\n\nThere is a version of this moment that involves throwing propriety into the sink and explaining ourselves to the wall afterward. We did not take that version. We walked to the balcony in the placebo of a lull and paused under the lamp that makes our skin the color of old photographs. The street below performed its late shift without checking our calendars. Alba turned to me with the caution of a person approaching a dog she knows and loves but does not want to startle. \u201cIf we,\u201d she said, and then laughed once at the ridiculousness of beginning with if we when she could have picked any other words, \u201cif we call this a question, will it be easier to answer?\u201d The flower of the cactus across the way had finished its performance days ago and was now a closed fist; we both looked at it as if it might translate.\n\n\u201cI am more patient with questions than answers,\u201d I said, because accuracy is the only gift I trust myself to bring to any altar. I stepped closer by the width of a lemon peel. She stepped closer by the thickness of her pencil shavings collected in a jar. The first touch was not a declaration or a theft; it was an edit. I kissed the corner of her mouth, a place that is overlooked in bad films and beloved in good lives, and she did not startle or sigh or perform anything; she moved toward me the fraction necessary to make the geometry true. It was not a long kiss; it was not a brief kiss; it was exactly the length of a corridor designed by somebody who understands that passing is the same as arriving if you intend well enough. We stood with our foreheads touching afterward like two children who have learned that earthquakes cannot be prevented by posture and decide to try anyway. Then we went back to the table and drank tea that had cooled into a different bargain, and we drew, deliberately, two doors on the same page. On one we wrote later. On the other we wrote now. We agreed to open both, but not at once, because we are not in the business of setting our own house on fire and then praising ourselves for the warmth.\n\nOf course someone knocked, because the universe belongs to playwrights. It was the rhythm of error: three taps too quick, then a hesitation that sounded like the back of a hand wiping sweat from a forehead. Alba slid the sketchbook under a folded newspaper with the fluidity that suggests both guilt and rehearsal. I went to the door and listened the way you listen to pipes; outside, a woman cleared her throat. My mother had decided to test the rules at nine at night, which in my personal system counts as a war crime. \u201cT,\u201d she said, soft enough that a less treacherous door would not have heard. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. The hotel\u2014there was\u2014never mind. I shouldn\u2019t have come.\u201d Alba stood behind me in the kitchen doorway, body like a comma, indicating continuation. I could feel my father\u2019s door across the hall become aware of itself; I could picture his mouth shaping No before Yes and then deciding to say nothing.\n\nI opened the door because the hinge had been oiled and because my cowardice has always been polite. My mother stood there with her coat open and her scarf done up like a complicated apology, hair that had forgotten to care. She held no bags, which made her look less like a danger and more like a sentence that had removed its punctuation. \u201cI know,\u201d she said, preempting me like a person used to arguing against the weather. \u201cNo kitchens. I am a kitchen fire. I should leave.\u201d I stepped back enough that she would not be wet by our stairwell rain and not enough to invite her into our low lamp and our kettle\u2019s jurisdiction. Alba moved neither forward nor backward; she acknowledged my mother with a nod that said, I know you are a noun in our grammar and I will not decline you out loud.\n\n\u201cYou can stand there,\u201d I said, which sounds like cruelty and is perhaps the most precise kindness I had offered her. \u201cYou can tell me what is wrong and I will tell you if I can help without breaking anything we have spent a year repairing.\u201d She breathed, which sometimes counts as a yes. The problem was small and humiliating: her bank card had sulked; the hotel wanted collateral; the friend who would have given her a couch had turned out to be and not to be a friend. I could have summoned a lecture on planning and on weather forecasts; I did not. I handed her the money from the jar we keep for emergencies of a more domestic variety\u2014plumber, light bulbs, lemons\u2014and said, \u201cThis is not generosity. This is a system we are participating in. You will return it the way rain returns vapor to the air after having its fun.\u201d She did not cry, for which I would have loved her if loving her were a thing I felt I could do safely; she looked at Alba and said, \u201cThank you,\u201d without naming her relation, which made me love Alba on the spot with a kind of accuracy that bordered on violence.\n\nWhen my mother left, the stairwell ate the sound of her steps responsibly. I closed the door. I put my forehead against it like someone eavesdropping on wood. Alba did not come to touch me; she dried a cup that had not been washed yet and placed it in the cupboard without looking. \u201cYou did not break anything,\u201d she said into the small domestic noise of porcelain and shelf. \u201cIf anything, you repaired something, neatly.\u201d I turned and leaned on the door, too long for it to qualify as a joke. We did not celebrate ourselves. We washed the few dishes that had not asked to be washed and we went to our rooms and we leaned against our own doors for a minute because sometimes you need to share a wall with yourself.\n\nThe city delivered the next morning as if nothing had been asked of it in the night. The woman with the pigeons scolded a child for giving too much at once; the buses bargained with lights; the sky pretended to be kind until noon. I met my mother in a caf\u00e9 near the station with a chair that had an opinion about my spine, and she handed me an envelope with the money and a receipt from the hotel as if to prove she had not invented the emergency. We drank coffee that had survived a war in its machine, and she told me about her day as if it were a book someone else had left on a table. \u201cI am learning,\u201d she said, \u201cthat apology is a skill and not a mood.\u201d I told her about a pen that ran and paper that accepted it and a factory that wants to be a corridor, and we performed the theatrical politeness that keeps certain buildings standing.\n\nThe day ended with an event too small to dignify in some narratives and too significant to ignore here: the model of the Building of Necessary Closeness fell off the table. It was nobody\u2019s fault, which, like apology, is an art. One minute the model had been obeying gravity with grace; the next it committed to flight and failed. The narrow corridor split along the seam where we had forced it to be generous. The stair to nowhere detached and lay splayed like a sentence that had forgotten its verb. Alba sat on the floor next to the wreckage and did not touch it because she had learned in hospital rooms that you let broken things declare their injuries before you try to set them. I sat with her and waited for cardboard to admit what it was ready to do. My father crouched with his large careful hands and said, \u201cTape and time,\u201d as if ordering at a bar. Alba\u2019s mother fetched the good glue from the high shelf where the pharmacy lives and placed it in Alba\u2019s palm with a ceremony that made me feel the weight of small bottles.\n\nWe repaired it, which is poetry\u2019s ugly cousin, and we did it with a concentration that canceled the city\u2019s performance outside our windows. The corridor, rejoined, accepted its seam as part of its line; the stair, reaffixed, declared its uselessness with renewed pride. Alba looked at me with glue on her fingers like the evidence of a long letter, and I thought, not for the first time, that the days are not enemies when they hand you this much material. We placed the model back on the table as if returning a body to a bed after making it lighter with names, and the four of us stood around it with the solemnity reserved for the least dramatic sacraments. After, Alba and I took the lemon magnet and moved the boy\u2019s drawing of the bus with wings to make room for a note written in her precise hand: Repair is a form of design. We looked at it, and then we let the kettle boss us back into motion, and the record player consented to be asked and responded with a crackle that sounded like rain remembering how to speak.\n\nLater that night, when the flat had placed its sleeps in the correct rooms, I went to Alba\u2019s door and knocked that permission rhythm we have taught one another. She said, \u201cYes,\u201d and I entered, which is the most underrated achievement any person can hope for. The sketchbook lay open to the page with later and now; we had drawn the doors and not opened either. I took my pen, the blue my mother had given me as if to atone for every black she had used to write her leaving, and I wrote under later: patience is not postponement; under now I wrote: permission is not ruin. Alba read the annotations as if they were building codes; she looked up and smiled from the muscles in her cheeks all the way to the ones you can\u2019t see and said, \u201cWe can work with that.\u201d We turned off the light not because we are chaste or dramatic but because night deserved at least one unobserved generosity, and we sat in the almost-dark with the window letting in the iron of Oviedo and the soft announcements of buses doing their job, and we leaned shoulder to shoulder like a pair of hinges agreeing not to squeak, not tonight.",

The morning put a small coin of sunlight on the floor by the window, a brightness that confused the cat on the balcony below into thinking it had been granted a promotion. The kettle tried to stage its usual coup and failed in a new way; the whistle rose and then flattened into an embarrassed wheeze, like a singer who has woken up in the wrong octave. My father thumped the counter with the heel of his hand as if reminding oak where it comes from would help metal remember its purpose; Alba tilted her head toward the sound, that surgeon\u2019s listening she has, and said, without drama, \u201cIt\u2019s the gasket.\u201d I do not know when I learned the word gasket; perhaps it entered the house through the same door as lemon peels and patience. I put my ear near the spout like a person trying to overhear a confession and heard not a failure but a tiredness. \u201cTape and time,\u201d my father said again, this time to an appliance, and I thought of the note on the model: Repair is a form of design. Outside, the city rubbed its iron into the day until we tasted it with our toast; the woman with the pigeons wagged a finger at a seagull that had wandered into the regime; the buses rehearsed their enunciation and almost got it right.\n\nThe university sent me an email with a subject line that inflated itself like a frog: Regional Literary Evening, Confirmed Speakers, Logistics. The body was more polite and less confident; a coordinator asked if I might read two poems and a prose piece because \u201cyour work seems to understand that nouns have hearts.\u201d I snorted into the cheap yogurt and then wrote back yes, because I am learning that saying yes out loud to the kinds of invitations I used to laminate in my head is a way to become a person other than my worst rehearsal. Alba\u2019s professor, not to be outdone by any frog, had posted the schedule for the end-of-term review and her name appeared in a column under the bold seriousness of External Jury, which meant real architects with opinions fashioned into sharp accessories would stand in front of her cardboard and graphite and tell her who she had been pretending to be. She read the schedule and set it down and slid her pencil under the spine of her sketchbook as if she were tucking a blade into a boot. \u201cGood,\u201d she said, and the word had so much architecture in it that the chairs straightened their backs.\n\nMy mother sent the notebook she\u2019d promised, and I hated it a little for being beautiful. It arrived in an envelope that had survived the mail as if the mail had been generous, which is not its reputation. The cover was black and honest; the paper inside had that slight resilience under your finger that says, I will forgive at least two drafts, maybe three. Tucked into the first page was a letter written with the ink that had always been her weakness, a blue that made my mouth think of winter beads on wire when I was small and she used to fix necklaces at the kitchen table as if mending could be a living. I did not read it at the table; I put it under the lemon magnet as if giving it the same jurisdiction as recipes and a child\u2019s drawing of a bus with wings would prove that it could not carry fire. I read it later on the balcony with my shoulder pressed against the cold railing like a person asking a train to please arrive. She wrote sentences like dressing rooms: some mirrors, some hooks to hang anger on, some light that was too forgiving and then suddenly mean. She wrote that apology is a room she keeps sweeping and never finds the corners of; she wrote about Madrid\u2019s doors in summer, how they swell and stick and have to be persuaded without humiliation; she wrote she\u2019d stood outside a painted-shut door with her hand raised and had not knocked for the first time in her life, a personal applause she didn\u2019t trust; she wrote that she had been wrong about the shape of hunger and perhaps about the shape of love. She did not ask me anything, which is a trick I recognized from both good letters and superior manipulation; she happened near me on paper and waited to see if I would follow. I folded the pages back into the notebook and carried it to my desk and set it next to Alba\u2019s sketchbook and the nearness of the two felt like a joke I did not know how to tell.\n\nCarmen dragged us to a post-rehearsal after-something on a Tuesday in a bar two streets from the theater, a place where the lamps pretend to be old and the bottles have learned to present their labels as if they were diplomas. She wore a sweater with a rip at the hem that had transformed into identity, and she had a new way of saying citizen that included the bartender, which is a coup most actors don\u2019t manage. Mara sat with her feet tucked on her chair as if chairs were suggestions and not rules, and they bickered in a way that promised either violence or a collaboration; I am a romantic when it comes to the idea of people who spar with verbs and come away with fewer wounds than better jokes. The power didn\u2019t go out and there were no dragons in the ceiling, so we were forced to admit we like ordinary nights when nobody performs calamity. Alba watched Carmen explain how a line that had refused to be said for a week finally lay down and let itself be rehearsed, and she smiled with her mouth and her fingers, both, because good sentences and good stairs give her the same satisfaction: they bear weight without asking to be admired every second. I sat there trying to remember what it is I know how to do other than hold the ends of someone else\u2019s courage while they tie a knot.\n\nThe kettle took its grievance to a higher register the next morning. The gasket, which had been a theory, announced itself as a fact; steam insisted on unprofessional exits. My father took the thing apart on our kitchen table with a concentration he reserves for the moons of Jupiter and receipts, and the kettle, stripped of its lemon anonymity, looked indecent, a naked metal body that had trusted us too much. \u201cWe\u2019ll get a new one on Sunday at El Rastro,\u201d Alba\u2019s mother said, using \u201cwe\u201d like a truce flag. \u201cIf we find the right dent.\u201d Alba, stubborn in a way that sometimes makes me think of saints who refuse to give up roads they loved, said, \u201cWe can fix it,\u201d and went to find the brown paper tape and a piece of soft rubber she had kept from some other emergency. We sat as if at the surgery of a brass patient; she patched with that careful hand she uses when disappointment is watching. The whistle returned a portion of itself, just enough to be recognized, and we applauded the way you do when a child bows after a school recital and you are applauding not for music but for courage. \u201cRepair is a form of design,\u201d I said, pointing at the note we\u2019d taped by the model, and my father kissed the gasket with a ridiculous solemnity he would deny in court.\n\nSundays at the flea market are not Madrid\u2019s Rastro, but Oviedo\u2019s version has learned how to pretend. The stalls spread their pride down a side street that can carry the smell of frying oil and old jeans and optimism without flinching. We went as a unit because that is how we shop when we are pretending not to: Carmen joined as if she had always been invited and began trying on hats nobody asked her to pay for; Mara came because flea markets are where she practices saying no and yes in equal measure; my father held his hands behind his back as if to signal to the years that he would not touch them; Alba and I hunted kettles in the way you hunt deer in films, with coats and code. We found three that qualified for our interest: a blue that was too proud, a stainless one that looked like the future had failed to arrive, and a lemon-yellow twin to ours with a dent in exactly the wrong place, which is to say precisely where memory lives. The vendor, a man with a face built out of old tools and triumphs, saw the way Alba\u2019s eyes did not leave that dent and said, \u201cIt works, but you have to speak soft to it.\u201d Alba turned the kettle in her hands like a person evaluating a conch; she looked at me; I looked at my father; he looked at the sky, which had the decency to ignore him. We bought it not to replace but to understand. \u201cWe will cannibalize,\u201d Alba said on the walk home, and I loved her with my list-maker\u2019s heart for saying out loud the plan we were not yet ready to sentimentalize: the old giving its small good pieces to the old, so both can continue their impossible work.\n\nThe week advanced with the stubborn gait of a person recovering from a knee injury. I rehearsed aloud, sometimes to the lemon magnet, sometimes to the new-not-new kettle, and sometimes to the empty hallway where the sound of my own voice forces me to file my verbs without complaint. The Regional Literary Evening has the kind of name that makes a certain type of poetry curl into itself, but the people in it were the good kind: teachers with permanent markers on their fingers, students with patience in their shirts, an old woman with hair installed like royalty who would tell me afterward that my pigeons reminded her of mass. Alba printed pin-up boards and built a small backup model in case the jury decided to call her bluff on stairs that pretended to do nothing; she wore her pencil behind her ear as if she had been born with it camouflaged in hair. We took turns standing in the kitchen reading and pinning and not fainting. Carmen brought us energy in the form of stolen theater snacks that taste like cardboard and survival; Mara brought us doubt that she had sanded into support.\n\nMy mother wrote nothing for three days and then a message that didn\u2019t know whether it was an apology or a weather report. She said she had stood on a Madrid sidewalk and listened to a street musician insist that Thelonious Monk is a city and had resisted the urge to correct him. She said she had found an old photograph of me with my hair in a fight with itself and a lemon in each hand and had had the indecency to cry. She did not ask when she could come again. I replied with a sentence that had been trying to be born for a month: I need you to keep to the rules because I have used up my spare parts on other repairs. She sent back the word understood three times, as if she hoped repetition could be a hinge.\n\nThe evening of readings unfolded like a well-behaved train: it arrived, it made its stops, it apologized for delays it hadn\u2019t committed. The room had more people than chairs wanted to accommodate and some of them leaned against the walls in ways that would make a fire inspector sweat with joy. The organizers had hung prints of the city at dusk as if we needed proof of what we were doing; a table at the back held those small bottles of water that make adults feel like children playing conference. I read the bus poem because it now expects to be read when there are microphones and bread; I read the corridor piece because I wanted to say out loud that passing is a kind of architecture, not just courtesy; I read a new paragraph about repair and how tape is a confession and glue an oath. My father sat next to Alba\u2019s mother on the left side as if left side were a meaningful location; they held hands when they forgot to be cautious. Alba sat on the right next to Carmen and Mara and their combined attention behaved like a rope bridge: it swayed, but I trusted it. Halfway through the second piece I saw my mother at the very back, half in the hall, a student\u2019s chair holding her as if chairs should not have been expected to carry that much history. I did not change a word; I did not remove a metaphor I had written with her in mind; I did not add a line to make her life easier or my argument stronger. When it ended, the clapping was the good kind, the clapping that holds no pity in its palms. Alba came to me first, because she knows how to be both now and later; she put her hand briefly on my shoulder, a public gesture that means more to me than any private thunder; Carmen kissed the air near both my cheeks as if blessing me with theatrical unction; Mara squeezed my fingers until my nails were proof that I am alive. My mother approached not like a penitent or a thief but like a citizen of weather; she said \u201cthank you\u201d and nothing else, and I let that be our entire language for a day.\n\nThe review was two mornings later in a room that had been painted white so often it had begun to look like a palace that had read an article about restraint. The external jury entered with scarves and opinions; their shoes whispered they had been in buildings we could not afford to visit. Students pinned up their boards with hands that shook in languages I didn\u2019t know the names of; someone dropped a model and four men looked away in polite horror, which is the kindest thing grownups can do when a thing breaks in public. Alba took her place in front of the Building of Necessary Closeness and stood with the posture she keeps for storms: not aggressive, not retreating, simply present. She introduced the stair to nowhere as practice and the corridor as policy; she talked about fire with such respect that one of the men glanced involuntarily toward the exits. They asked her about heat and air and disability and a culture that can barely stand to brush a sleeve against a stranger; she answered in a way that made one of the women look down to cover her smile and then up again to perform rigor. I watched the professor with storm-cloud hair restrain herself from being proud; she succeeded only in the sense that lightning succeeds in being quiet. When Alba finished, there was a kind of silence that feels like a hand extended for a handshake, and then the woman with the serious shoes said, \u201cYour wrongness is useful,\u201d and pinned a note in yellow that read: Keep the nearness; design the mercy with more cruelty. Alba nodded and later, much later, when we were home and the kettle was finally willing to be itself again, she laughed about the paradox of being told to be more cruel in order to reach kindness.\n\nWe took the repaired model to an exhibition in a municipal hall that smelled like pension papers and ceremonies. On the walk there it rained sideways with the relish of a master remembering its trick; we wrapped the cardboard in a plastic sheet that had been a painter\u2019s drop cloth when my father tried to teach a wall to behave. At the hall, the corridor to the display room adapted itself into a test of vows: it narrowed twice, inconveniently, and the second time Mara laughed and said, \u201cYour building has manifested.\u201d We turned the model sideways and then diagonally and then stood still until a man with a dolly offered his vehicle like a knight in an elevator. We thanked him and practiced gratitude as a choreography while we cleared a corner of a table and wrestled our cardboard into the slice of space that had been allotted to us by a person who loves metrics. We hung the note Repair is a form of design at the top left, not as doctrine this time, but the way religious people hang a saint beloved for her stubbornness. In the little storeroom beside the hall, where a mop leaned like a person who had seen it all and chosen to remain civil, Alba put her forehead briefly against my shoulder and let out the breath I had heard her collect all morning. I did not take advantage of any of the versions of us that room might have allowed; I stood and leaned back just enough to make it clear I was not giving her to gravity. We listened to the life of the hall\u2014the coughs out front, the municipal clatter, the plastic tarp sighing itself into place\u2014and we laughed because exhibitions are just public storage with better lighting.\n\nThat night the rain remembered itself as theater and threw itself at our windows with the same ambition as an actor who has been given one line and decides it is monologue. The new gasket, the old kettle, the replacement kettle, the apartment\u2019s wires, the window\u2019s seal\u2014all held. The ceiling, however, decided to express an opinion above the narrow corridor between our rooms. It began as a single dark petal and then gathered a bouquet; the first drip was the size of a rude remark; the second established a rhythm. We set bowls down like applause. The sound\u2014the high plink of ceramic, the lower thud when the water forgot itself and overshot\u2014became a music that threatened to be a metaphor and therefore had to be interrupted occasionally by laughter. My father called the emergency number for men who believe in ladders and one arrived with the resigned cheer of people who have saved kitchens from worse. He poked the ceiling with the kind of authority that makes even plaster tell the truth; he declared it a roof line sulk; he promised nothing and brought a tarpaulin joy into our house. The hinge squeaked again when he left, and I kept the squeak like a whistle around my neck because not all smoothness is mercy; sometimes you want to be warned when a door decides to love you enough to open.\n\nWe decided to be brave in small, repeatable ways. We kissed again, in a kitchen after midnight where the bowls still gathered what the roof could not hold, and we did not leave evidence on the counter except two cups turned upside down to dry in the way my grandmother taught me. We told no one the thing we were telling ourselves, not yet; we agreed with a degree of cruelty that made mercy possible that we would not sacrifice our house to a meaning it could not withstand. We walked in the city not as a demonstration but as practice; our shoulders found a distance that is evident only to the bodies involved; occasionally our hands experimented with gravity and passed, briefly, in a space where passing is a kind of ownership. Carmen noticed once and did not write a play about it; Mara noticed twice and put the knowledge in the place she keeps for people who are not yet ready to congratulate themselves.\n\nLists returned because I am more myself with them than without. I made a list of things that belong to the wrong rooms: my mother\u2019s letter on the balcony, the lemon magnet in my father\u2019s pocket because he likes to worry it like a coin, the way Alba\u2019s model pieces appear on the bathroom sink like fish that jumped. I made a list of sounds for the hospital ward because Nurse Ana left a voice message that was just the word spectacular and I felt called to respond: the muffled applause of socks on linoleum, Nano\u2019s dragon-free hum near the tape, the guitar\u2019s careless mercy, the click of gel bottles, and the way someone says hello from behind a curtain because privacy has decided to be a joke for five minutes. I made a list of words we must not use yet: girlfriend, betrayal, forever, accident; and a corresponding list of words we could rehabilitate: practice, hinge, corridor, permission.\n\nMy mother asked for a time and I gave her one; we sat on a bench where the city lets teenagers try out boredom without lasting harm, and she asked about the reading not so she could say she was there but so she could say I was; she says my name now as if I had some claim to it she is willing to recognize. She did not ask about Alba; she asked about linguistics with that glass in her voice that used to be charm; I told her about the passive habitual and she laughed and said, \u201cFinally a mood I understand,\u201d and it is possible to love a joke without loving the person who made it. When we parted, she touched the notebook as if not sure whether to ask it for custody. I told her she could send sentences into it if they didn\u2019t ask to be answered; she sent three that night that were just descriptions of rain in Madrid and none of them used iron and I decided that was fair.\n\nThe city staged a minor riot of spring; the trees on Avenida de Galicia did that thing where they trick you into thinking leaves are a decision you can make every morning; the woman with the pigeons let a toddler hand her a piece of bread to distribute as if training him for a powerful office; the buses, benevolent and tired, carried us away from and toward all the places that make a week hold together. Alba\u2019s model stood at its municipal post as if it had always belonged there, and sometimes when we walked by she would straighten a corner like a mother smoothing a cowlick on a child, and I would pretend not to notice in case my noticing made her stop.\n\nOn a Thursday that had grown exhausted from being responsible, Carmen and Mara turned up at our door with a deck of cards and a bag of potatoes, because nothing says you are planning a harmless evening like starchy vegetables and chance. We cooked the potatoes into a thing that argued about the right word for itself and played a game where losing meant you had to confess a small truth that would not break the room. Carmen admitted she steals chalk from rehearsal rooms and feels no remorse because chalk needs more stage time; Mara said she pretends not to know the end of plays she has memorized so she can be newly angry at old men every week; my father said he thinks the lemon magnet is luck and kisses it when he believes we do not see; Alba said she designed the first sketch of the corridor because she wanted to make us all brush by the necessary and now she doesn\u2019t know how to stop. I said I have kept every list I wrote in the hospital in a folder with the spine broken and I open it when I need to remember that attention is political; no one asked me what I mean by political, for which I adored them all.\n\nWhen we went to bed, the night put one of those false lights on the kitchen table again, a coin we couldn\u2019t account for. The hinge announced, gently, every time someone moved through the hallway, back and forth, back and forth, practicing arrivals that refused to call themselves that. The kettle, repaired, elected to sing rather than wheeze, and there is a humility in fixed things that new things will always envy. I lay there and listened to the apartment\u2019s small congress, and I thought about the page in the sketchbook with the two doors labeled later and now and the annotations we had added and the ones we had yet to earn, and I thought about how to write into a life without setting it on fire first. The answer, when it came, was not complicated and not noble: we would go on, and that would be the bravest thing we could manage, until we could not, and then we would design the repair.",
