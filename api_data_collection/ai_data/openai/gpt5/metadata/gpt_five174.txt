The ants came up through the hairline in the tile grout one by one, as if the stone itself were hatching something with legs and an opinion. Josephine watched them in the late light, a slanted ribbon of sun cutting the kitchenette into two countries. In the bright one her hands were jade with dish soap, little moons of iridescence on the knuckles; in the dim one the ants marched, single-file into single-file until they were a double black thread that cinched her day together.

She set the splurge gun on the counter like a saxophone. That’s what she called it—splurge gun—an old pastry bag with a retooled nozzle, tubing, a pump, and a trigger harvested from a ruined Super Soaker. The reservoir was loaded with syrup cooked down to a consistency she had iterated toward until the first time she hit an ant and it flowered into foam like a mushroom erupting in a raindrop. Sugar and air and a hiss. The splurge would bloom, dry, and keep the shape of the last thing it embraced. They couldn’t run; their tiny feet were the last to disappear.

“Do you know what love is,” she said to them, and the fan above the stove hummed because it was old and had things to say. “It’s the thing you can’t be without, the air inside the air.”

She squeezed. The pump coughed once, then steadied. The nozzle drew a neat serpentine across a phalanx of ants and they seized, their legs decorated suddenly with pale sugar that hardened or pretended to, glistening like frost. Josephine let them freeze mid-step, took out her phone, knelt until her knee clicked, and found focus. A tighter frame, closer, closer, as close as the lens would go. The feet like dots with a secret; the disarticulate miracle of them. She shot three, turned the camera to square, shot four more. When she stood, her head brushed the cabinet door, and a tiny eddy of plaster dust drifted down like tired snow.

She posted to her album: Love is a Foot, vol. 273. It was private in name only. The privacy settings were permissive, and she had learned the algorithm’s small religions by accident. If she captioned with something that sounded like a grandmother thinking, the network would carry it further. So she wrote: Take care of the little feet that bring the bread home. Then a heart, then a sunflower, then two words that made her hands burn when she typed them: Ours forever.

The comments would come. Feet. Always with the feet. Are u ok? This is art. This is weird art. I love tiny things too. What do you feed them. What does it mean. What page is this. Are you mad. More. More more. She didn’t respond for a while because she had learned the pleasures of withholding. The point of the album was not to be caught but to be seen. She moved to the sink and ran water until it got cold, then hot, then made her laugh for no reason except that the ants were quiet and there was a small window downstairs like a mouth that would be open if she rushed.

Sergeant Ragan had learned not to rush. You could spend your whole life breaking your head on the doorframe if you rushed. The mop handle made a sound on the stone that could have been a flute if there were a river nearby. In the old bathhouse, morning mists still came through the ceiling where the poor patch job had made the damp prioritize certain beams. She touched them sometimes, as if checking a forehead for fever. There were names etched in the tile from 1937, 1951, 1969. Derry had a thousand dates and forty names that repeated like prayers.

Ragan swept a wrapper, a bottle cap, two miracles of lint. She was into the floor. She cared about floors. If you asked her politely why a former sergeant would take a job this small, she’d tell you about her mother, about the way you could do two things badly or one thing with grace, and then she would hand you a key with a smile that did not wait for permission to be true. The Council paid her. She locked the doors at ten because the artists would keep painting until their blood sugar ran out and the old bathhouse didn’t need more ghosts, not if she could help it.

She paused at the notice board and read a poster for the third time because it had a picture of the river. The Foyle looked like a piece of metal in winter; just now the sky outside rattled with gulls, and she felt them as the feather on the back of her neck. She checked her phone. Two new voicemails. One from her mother. One from a number she still had saved under a first name she hadn’t said out loud in eight months.

“Ragan, it’s Declan. You won’t pick up, I know, but I’m asking you to practice. Call me back. Something’s moving.”

She finished the corridor, the mop detail at the corners where dust nested like reluctant birds. She was deliberately slow, long strokes, and that was a prayer of her own. Outside, a bin lorry hammered by, and she checked the clock and decided not to call yet. She knew the tone in Declan’s voice: the hopeful fear that old soldiers carry for the battle they’ve sworn to leave.

When she did call him, the ring cut too quickly. “Sarge,” he said. The title fell out before he could catch it. “Hi. Sorry. Ragan.”

“Aye,” she said. The word made a small harbor. “What’s moving.”

“You see Facebook at all, these days?”

“Me?” She looked at the notice board as if it could answer for her. “You know me and now.”

“Right. No, but there’s—Ragan, there’s a page. Several. We’ve had three calls this morning. Well, two and one that felt like a call. Photographs. Legs. Feet. Like trophies, but not quite. And they’re tagged to a group that… it’s local. Started here. Someone’s got a hobby.”

“Murder as hobby or as art?”

“Art first. Then—I don’t know yet. We’ve one body down by the quay that looks like he fell or was pushed. Shoes missing. And he was tagged in a photo of feet, which, Christ, I hear myself. It sounds mad.”

“Whose page.”

There was a pause, wind noise in the speaker, a door closing. “Name’s different every day. Today it’s ‘Our Tiny Roads.’ Yesterday it was ‘Pilgrim Sole.’ Same album. Same hands. We got metadata from one of the photos the admin didn’t strip. It pings off a tower near the bathhouse.”

She looked up at the bay window that had been painted shut in 1982. If she pressed her fingernail near the latch, a thin skin of paint would come away like peeling sun. “You want me to do what, Declan.”

“Walk the neighborhood. Keep your eyes on the weird. Talk to your lads. People talk to you. They won’t talk to me in uniform. The other thing is, there’s a signature. Ants.”

“Ants,” she said, and the word did something in her mouth, like chewing anise you didn’t ask for. “What signature do ants have.”

“In the photographs,” he said. “There’s always ants. What do ants and feet have to do with love, you tell me. The comments are a storm. And—one more thing—the copycats. We got two from Nigeria and one from Ohio. Same night. Hashtag is ‘FootprintForever.’ The death count’s not a count, but it jumped. Someone’s playing the conductor.”

She took the phone away from her ear and looked at it like it had changed languages, then brought it back. “I’m not going back,” she said. “I’ll say that first. I’m not going back. But I’ll make a list.”

“For me,” he said, and it meant for the city. It meant for the mother who couldn’t sleep through thunder. “Keep safe.”

“I’m mopping,” she said. “I’m an utter terror with the mop.”

They both laughed, the kind of laugh that was a humble bridge you could walk over to be in the same country again. When she hung up, she went to the staff room, boiled the kettle, and searched the things he had said. Names, hashtags, the photos. She saw the album cover because it was deliberately close to wholesome: a baby foot on a doormat, a ballerina with her toes ruined into heroism, a man with bunions and a tattoo that said ELLIE on his big toe. Down scroll, scroll, the palette shifted like the sky does when a storm approaches. And then she saw them. Ants like commas around a heavy sentence. Sugar hardening where ankle would be if an ant were a person. And the caption, this one pinned: Love is the only good hunger.

She had the feeling she got sometimes when the key’s in the lock and you’re confident until the moment it snags. She felt the snag. She drank her tea with a mouthful of dread and, worse, recognition.

Josephine had a ritual that made sense to her even when it didn’t make sense to any other noun in the room. She left her flat at dawn and at dusk to walk the same three streets with the same three trees. The beech near the bus stop had an old nail in it where a poster once was, and she touched that nail when she passed. It was the way you check your person before you leave: keys, phone, wallet, nail. She carried the splurge gun broken down into pieces in a tote painted with a fox. Feeding tubes in the side pocket. She had little vials of sugar dust like talc that she could breathe into the air if the day demanded a coat of wonder. In her pocket where she kept the vials she also kept a photograph of a girl’s foot on a hospital sheet, the toes patient with polish.

At the park she sat on the steel bench that held the dawn like breath. Children came later; dogs came always. Ants found her because she never ate without sharing. She put a smear of jam on the brick by her foot and watched them gather, which is what watching is: to gather what gathers. When a man sat beside her with a dog that had a face like a coin, she retracted her knees, made room, smiled without teeth.

“Strange, isn’t it,” he said, nodding at the jam. “The wee soldiers.”

“They’re almost perfect,” she said. “Because they don’t believe they’re alone.”

“I suppose you do.”

“Most days,” she said. “And you.”

He glanced down at his ripped laces and smiled like someone who had been forgiven for a joke. “Only when I’m sleeping.”

She took a picture of the ant procession deliberately wide so the dog’s paws were in frame, the fur like the inside of a nut, toes like a good piano. She posted it with the caption: Work boots for small jobs. When the man glanced at her screen, she tilted it so he could see. “I take photos,” she said, and his eyes did the quick assessment of threat and then moved off.

“My brother’s a photographer,” he said. “He made money on weddings. Then he started doing the… fashion, you know. Feet are good. People like feet.”

“People like love,” she said.

“You say it as if they don’t.”

“As if they don’t know how to hold it,” she said. She didn’t tell him about the girl in the photograph, the one with the careful toes, the one who had stolen the letter L from Josephine’s name and wouldn’t give it back even after the bed was empty and the alarm clock no longer knew what to do with its hands. She didn’t say that love had no pockets. Instead she took out the nozzle of the splurge and let it clink against the bench because sound felt honest.

Somewhere far away and then nearer, someone laughed online and it sounded like a bucket dropped in a stairwell. Ragan spent her lunch break at the desk in the office with the nicked varnish and the chair from when the building had been a place you learned to swim. She started making a list. Weirder-than-weird things she’d noticed in the last days:

- Shoe prints with no feet. At the edge of the park near the bench with the blue slats, one set of prints that walked out and then back into its own path.

- A woman at the shop buying a dozen jars of jam and a child asking if ants could drown and the woman saying Please let them swim.

- A notice for a “footphotography challenge” printed on A4 and taped to the church door, then torn down before evening.

- A boy outside the pub with bare feet on the pavement in March, smiling like he had swallowed the sun; his friend filming his steps.

She wrote names beside the items where she knew names, then scratched them out. Names were a luxury behind glass. She looked at her phone again and decided to never again look, then looked. The American copycat had posted five minutes ago. It was a foot in a sink with a gold chain on the ankle, polished nails, a little smear of something like tomato sauce near the heel. The caption read: Kiss the ground that kisses you. The comments were a river and a fever at the same time. And the third photo in the set was not a foot. It was a hand with two fingers missing. She swore softly into the empty room and stood too fast so that the chair marked the floor with a sound like regret.

“Are you going to do something,” her mother asked when she brought the shopping up after her shift. Her mother’s flat smelled like boiled ham and lavender. It smelled like the bridge between the living and the gone. “You have that look,” her mother added, and reached without looking to straighten a frame on the wall. Her father in uniform looked both proud and undone.

“What look.”

“The look you had the day you threw your badge in the river.”

“I didn’t throw it,” Ragan said. “I gave it back.”

“If you had thrown it we’d have had to get you a new coat,” her mother said, with the exact gravity such a thing deserved. “Tell me or don’t tell me. I know both men.”

“Someone is doing art,” Ragan said. “And other someones are making it into a sport.”

“Feet?”

“Yes,” she said, and her mother laughed a small crisp laugh. “It’s not funny,” Ragan added, and her mother sighed a small crisp sigh.

“No, the world keeps telling me that. Every time I find it funny it’s something else. You can’t stop them all, Aileen. You can stop the one in front of you, maybe.”

“I know who she is,” Ragan said, and the statement surprised her by arriving without permission. But there it was, not quite a lie. She could feel the shape of the she without seeing her face; she could already see the hands. She had cleaned floors after those hands. She had walked after those cruelty-tender, precise, ridiculous hands.

“How do you know.”

“By how much,” she said. It didn’t make sense to her mother, but her mother nodded anyway. The old shorthand. “Will you be all right tonight.”

“I’ve been all right longer than you’ve been alive,” her mother said. “But yes, if you want it plain. Take the tin of biscuits. In your world people should love you more, not less, for the biscuits you carry.”

Down by the quay a boy filmed another boy pretending to slip. “Do it again,” he said. “Make it look more accidental.” The wind made them both cry, but neither was sad. When one of them finally did slip and hit his head he didn’t die, and that was not yet the day for the ambulance. The girl filming the girls across the river posted a picture of her friend’s heel with the caption: This is where every story starts. And somewhere else, a man named Yinka in Ibadan set a saucer of honey near his door and watched the ants assemble and then filmed his wife’s feet stepping over them. The comments section for all of them did the thing comments sections do when a game begins: deputized everyone, made the rules loud and wrong, struck the matches.

Josephine had a job she did from home for a company that would have another name next year. She made the mistake of liking the part of the job that was to watch and remove. She knew the community guidelines by heart the way a priest knows the rubrics. She knew that a foot could be porn or medicine. She knew the difference between a tribute and a presentment without looking it up. She was paid to make decisions that made people angry, and she found that anger vivid and unhelpful and sometimes holy.

In between the tickets she reviewed, she edited her own photographs with the care a watchmaker brings to a balance spring. She would brighten, feather, saturate, take it back, look at the noise and the grain, and see what she always saw: a person that was not strictly herself but that was also not nobody.

Her neighbor in the hall came home with a bag of oranges and a face like he’d slept in a different house. “I saw your pictures,” he said, and his voice had that interrogative curl people get when they want to be on your side but need you to permit it.

“Do you like them,” she asked, and in the time the question hung she thought about her name the way you think about a coin in your pocket: you don’t take it out every time, but you check it’s there.

“They’re—there’s a word I don’t have. Old women would say ‘queer’ like it means unusual. That word. And kind. There’s kindness in the way you look at things.”

“I know how to look,” she said. “It’s my one trick.”

“You see the ants.”

“I see the ants and the feet.”

He tilted his head. “Do you see the rest.”

“What rest.”

“The person. After the feet.”

She smiled. “Soon.”

Ragan was the rest and the after and she knew it without a speech. She went to the quay in the late afternoon when the tide had turned and the stones looked wet with new thought. Declan met her near the rail where someone had just scratched two letters into the paint. D and E. She didn’t point to them but she saw them. He had his hands in his pockets and the hood up though it wasn’t raining. “They’ve got us on a task force,” he said as they walked, which meant they had two detectives and an analyst who liked graphs.

“Do your graphs look like stairs,” she asked, and he laughed.

“They look like a triangle got angry,” he said. “And then they look like a meteor went backward into the sky. The numbers aren’t bodies, not yet, but they are incidents. Feet. Ants. Challenges. And this morning a message. You ready.”

“For a message,” she said. “I was born.”

He handed her his phone because no one likes to read a threat off their own. The message had been sent to the group using a name: The Woman with the Gate. There was a photograph attached of an iron gate painted white that Ragan recognized as the one in front of the bathhouse’s side entrance. The text read: Caretakers of the small are the only ones who can stop me. So catch me. Or don’t. I love either way.

There was also a poem that was not a poem, just a list of things:

- Sugar, light, patience.

- The nail in the tree.

- The part of a person furthest from the heart that still tells the truth.

“What does that even mean,” Declan said, which was generous, because of course he knew it meant feet. He stood there in his good shoes and his troubled hair. He was sixteen in her mind sometimes, and that was unfair, but it made her better at looking for him in a crowd.

“Where did the boy fall,” she asked.

Declan pointed. “There.” The spot had a ring of people around it earlier, he said, the curious and the homeless and the furious and the ones who were there because some days you are pulled to the place where a thing almost happened. The blood had been more than they wanted it to be and less than she remembered from years ago. It was a small dishonest mark near the gutters now, like a lost thought. “He says he slipped,” Declan said. “But his shoes were gone when the medics came, and his socks were in his pocket. We found the socks by the bench. He says he doesn’t know what happened to the shoes.”

“He’s lying,” she said. “But not about all of it.” She could feel the pattern straining behind the cloth. Someone had coached, someone had rewarded, someone had made a game and put the power in the part of the body that does the walking.

“Come to the station,” Declan said. “Just sit in on the feed. See the madness. Say a name if a name comes.”

“My mother—”

“She’ll shout at me later. She’ll bring scones.”

Ragan didn’t go. She spent the evening at the bathhouse with the lights off, sitting at the top of the stairs where the air was filtered through old brick, and listened. She had learned the building the way you learn a friend’s mood. The hum of the boiler, the clack of pipes from when the heat kicked into argument, the little mouse that had claimed the cupboard and stated its boundaries with a grin. She heard something different now. It was not a sound but a lack. The gate was shut and locked and the white paint looked like teeth. She saw, in the paint, an old handprint of someone who had touched before the dry, then walked away with her hand marked white and had put that hand on the hem of her coat and the hem had remembered.

She wrote a letter on a paper bag. It said:

Whoever you are, it isn’t me, but I could pretend. Meet me in the park at the fox bench. Midnight. Bring your sugar. Bring your gospel. I’ll bring the parts of me that clean things other people have broken.

Then she tore it up because you don’t invite a storm into your pocket, you just wear a good hat. She went home and sat with her mother through the nine o’clock show neither of them watched. At eleven she checked the doors three times. At midnight she put on her coat and her boots and told the floorboards to be kind.

Josephine’s ritual for midnight was practiced and productively rude. She had learned the times the police were less of a wind and more of a chair. She did not think of herself as bad. She thought: if love is energy and energy cannot be created or destroyed, then what am I doing except moving heat around. She had a number in her head that was not a number but a feeling: three. The number of times she had kissed the girl’s toes through the blanket because the permission had been given and the morphine had made all spell-casters equal. The number of days since she had last eaten on a plate. The number of words in the line she couldn’t stop hearing when she closed her eyes: I want more.

The park at midnight was the part of the body that falls asleep last. The path was awake. The grass had decided to dream of ice. An owl made the textbook call as if to reassure the textbook. The bench was empty when Ragan arrived because she had arrived first, because she had never been good at sleeping when the case was awake. She put her hand on the fox painted on the bench’s back and felt a roughness where a child had tried to chip it away and given up. She sat and kept her ears out like two hands cupped to the hill.

Josephine came from the church side because the trees on that side had better manners. She had an apple in her pocket she had meant to eat but had not, and it bumped her thigh with the mechanical regularity of regret. When she saw the woman on the bench, she stopped as if a hand had pressed down on her head from a great height. Then she went forward because that is what love asks.

“Do you like the fox,” she said. The unheard part: Do you like me.

“I like whoever painted it,” Ragan said. Her face in the low light looked younger because worry draws lines and darkness erases them. “Do you have a name tonight, then.”

“You tell me,” Josephine said. “You’re the kind that reads labels.”

“Tonight you’re Josephine,” Ragan said, casually, and the air moved, even the hedge took a breath. Josephine made no expression with her mouth but her shoulders became a fraction less armored.

“Whoever told you that,” Josephine said softly, “is a thief.”

“We taught each other theft,” Ragan said. “We’ll return things in turn. Sit.”

“Will you arrest me,” Josephine said, because games are chairs, and you have to see who gets which one.

“I’m not wearing a badge,” Ragan said. “And I don’t believe that prison is the thing you need. It might be the thing I need to throw at you, someday. I’m not there yet. I came because you’re accelerating and you know it.” She could hear Declan in the word accelerating, and she hoped he would pardon the theft.

Josephine sat, kept three inches between them like a sacrament. The splurge-nozzle lay on her lap like a dog she hadn’t named yet. “No one ever calls it what it is,” she said. “No one looks and says Love.” Her voice made the world around it careful. “They say obsession. They say fetish. They say sick. They don’t say the word that is the only good prayer I know.”

“You love…” Ragan said, and let the sentence hang its own laundry. She wanted to watch it struggle. “What, exactly.”

“The part of a person that goes forward first,” Josephine said. “The part that tells the ground who you are. The part that leaves a mark without asking permission. The part that is furthest from pretending.” She breathed in through her nose, a steady practiced thing. “Ants teach this. They walk and they tell the story to each other and they never argue about the truth.”

“You’re hurting people,” Ragan said, not loudly. “Even when you don’t touch them. You’re making them dance for the crowd. You’re waking the part of the world that thinks spectacle is sacrament. The death count is going up because that’s how numbers work when you feed them every hour. It’s on the graphs, for God’s sake. Tell me you know this.”

“It’s not a contest,” Josephine said. Then she smiled a small wrong smile. “Except it is. It’s always been. Who holds the gaze. Who holds the hand. Who holds the heart. Who holds the feet when they stop moving.”

“And who holds the door,” Ragan said. She was suddenly exhausted. “I have a mother and I clean the baths and I am trying to hold the door of a place where people come and shake the cold off and feel like the town loves them back. I can’t hold your door as well, if you make it a wind tunnel.”

“Do you think you can stop me,” Josephine asked, not with challenge but with the genuine curiosity of a scientist watching water boil for the first time.

“I don’t know,” Ragan said. “I know I have to try. This is me trying. Talk to me before someone gets dead because you’re trying to teach them how to step.”

“You can’t make a pattern without repetition,” Josephine said. “A copycat is a mirror that loves you back. I am tired of being the only one who remembers how to love the small.” She turned to look full at Ragan then. The gaze was steady and full of a mercy that felt like a trick. “You look like someone who cleans up after parades.”

“I am,” Ragan said. “And somebody’s going to die. Probably someone small. That’ll be on you even if you never touch them.”

“Probability is the coward’s way to the future,” Josephine said. “I want sharp. I want right now.” She touched the nozzle of the splurge gun with a finger as if checking the pulse of a bird. “I will leave a gift.”

“I don’t want a gift.”

“It’s not for you.” She stood then and the bench did that small metal sound that knows how to be alone. “Do not follow me. If you do, I’ll run. If I run, you’ll never catch the next me. And the next me is already awake, in a city you don’t own.” She stepped away, not fast. Ragan did not rise. She watched Josephine walk the path with an economy that felt practiced. The soles of Josephine’s shoes made a sound like the end of a record.

In the morning, under the beech with the nail in it, there was a pair of shoes, clean, laced with red ribbon, and beside them an envelope with a photograph that showed the beech’s nail, a smear of sugar, and a foot in a hospital bed with the caption: Love is sometimes a corridor with no doors, and sometimes one. The group online had a new post. It read: To all caretakers: come get me before number five.

Number five would be a child if they didn’t hurry. Numbers do that: they lean downhill toward the hardest thing to carry. In Ohio, the police had found a girl in a backyard with sugar on her ankles and her mother crying because the internet had told her to try a harmless challenge and she hadn’t heard the part of the instructions that sounded like a prayer said backward. In Lagos, Yinka had filmed his wife’s feet dancing in the kitchen to show the copycats what joy looked like, and the comments had tried to turn it into a rule. In Jaipur, someone had gotten it into their head to paint hundreds of little footprints on the pavement so the town woke to a festival they hadn’t asked for. The death count didn’t have a noun yet, but it did have a slope.

Ragan met Declan halfway across the Peace Bridge because you stop in the middle of the river when you have to say a thing you’d rather not carry onto land. He had new printouts, thick with the lives of people they would never meet. She had a small hard certainty under her ribs like a coin. “She’s not hiding,” Ragan said. “She’s inviting. She’s made a party and she’s the host. That means she believes there’s a time. It’s soon. And she’s going to make it look like a love letter.”

“Can we get ahead of it with warnings,” Declan said. He had to ask; the world made him. “Public statements.”

“Every statement is a shape that someone will sneer at while stepping into it,” Ragan said. “But yes. Tell them: Don’t take photos of feet for strangers. Don’t feed the ants with jam in a row. Lock your gates. Silence your alarms. Better yet, meet your neighbors with biscuits and ask how they’re doing. That’s the only thing that ever stopped anything in this city. The kettle. The knock.”

“You tell me not to say graph and then you say kettle,” he said, and smiled like a lost boy who’d found a map even if it was drawn wrong. “All right. Kettle. Knock.”

“And find me a list,” she said. “People who paint their benches. People who touch the old nails. People who know the phrase ‘splurge gun’ without blushing.”

“What is a splurge gun, actually,” he said, glancing at the paper like it might have a diagram.

Ragan looked at the river, which was silver today because it had failed to decide what else to be. “It’s what you call something when you’ve made it yourself and you love it too much to give it an ordinary name. Like a ship. Or a sin.” She flexed her fingers because they had gone cold.

Josephine was awake all night. She had thought the conversation on the bench would calm the thing in her, and it hadn’t. It had lit up the inside of her head like a city seen from a plane. All her intersections. All her exits. She rearranged the bottles of sugar and the vials of dust. She ironed a ribbon. She taped a photograph to the ceiling and lay on the floor beneath it. The foot there was the foot of the girl she had loved, and the polish had chipped like a map. She whispered the girl’s name and the room answered with the other name that had been taken away from hers and she didn’t cry because crying was a kind of void and she preferred the fullness of the heart-shape her thoughts were making.

At four in the morning she posted a poem that wasn’t a poem. People tagged their friends. The moderators in her company wrote emails about if feet counted as violence. She approved and removed and loved and detested herself in waves.

By ten, two universities had held panels about the ethics of viral grief. By noon, a teacher in a small school outside town took away phones for the day and wrote the word Care on the board in chalk so thick it squeaked. By evening, a box of biscuits arrived at Ragan’s door with a note from an old woman who wrote in tiny capitals: IF YOU’RE AFTER THE GIRL AT DUNFIELD COURT, SHE DOESN’T SMILE WHEN SHE SAYS HI. LOVE, MRS. FRAZER. PS: I MAY BE WRONG BUT I HAVEN’T BEEN AND I’D LIKE THAT TO CONTINUE.

Ragan took the biscuits to the station, and the analyst took one and wiped the crumbs on the paper where the triangle had gotten angrier, and they called Mrs. Frazer and took Mrs. Frazer soup and heard about the girl named J who liked to sit on the landing and hum to herself. They went to Dunfield Court and the landing hummed of its own accord.

“I’ll go,” Ragan said. “She knows my voice.”

“She doesn’t know mine,” Declan said. “She will someday.”

“You’re good,” Ragan said. “Don’t spend it on the door.”

She knocked. She waited. She listened. Josephine stood ten feet away on the other side of the door and put her fingertips to the wood and matched five slender answers to the knocks. Neither of them spoke for a full minute and perhaps the town grew a tiny bone with that minute and used it to hold itself upright for a while longer.

“Why are you like this,” Ragan said finally, but in a tone she had perfected for speaking to cats who lived in the rafters: all invitation, very little demand.

“Because I lost the L,” Josephine said. “And no one gave me another letter.”

“Let me in,” Ragan said.

“Not today,” said the voice through the wood. “Tomorrow. Come to the baths. Bring the ones who know about water. I’ll show you what the word exponential feels like when it lands in your hands.”

Ragan breathed. It felt like a walk ended too early, the thing with the air. She looked at Declan and shook her head because that was the shape of the day. They left the biscuits with Mrs. Frazer and the wind did the thing where it goes down one street and not the other. The group online counted down, ten, nine, eight, with the confidence of people who believe they are in control.

At midnight there were footprints painted on the bathhouse floor, tiny ones in sugar dust, a path that led from the front door to the old deep end and stopped at the line where the water had once begun. Ragan stood in the doorway with her hands open the way you do when you want to be seen not as someone who has come to take away but as someone who has come to carry. Josephine stood at the far side with the splurge gun in her hands and something like joy in her face and a school of ants discovering the ragged edge of a biscuit near her shoe.

“If we do this,” Ragan said into the blue echo of the old pool. “No one comes out a saint.”

“Saints are poor at love,” Josephine said, and lifted the gun, and the first copycat in Manila splash-posted a foot, and a boy in Derry decided not to jump just yet, and Mrs. Frazer put her hearing aid in and prayed in tiny proud letters that spelled the only word that was a plan and a plea at once: Stay.Chapter 3

The pool was a rectangle of blue memory, the kind that had outlived water and developed an echo of its own. Under the ironwork rafters that used to sweat in summer, sugar dust made a map—a child’s deceit of footsteps leading from the door to the painted number that marked the deep end, a trail so tender you wanted to whisper to it. Ants had already found the first drift and were playing whatever game ants play when they stumble into a religion. The tiles kept their old shine, inherited from other custodians who believed a floor is a promise, and Ragan stood just inside the door with her palms bare, as if she needed them to remember what they were for.

Josephine faced her from across the pool, where the starting blocks had been borrowed to line up three glass jars of syrup like saints in a niche. She had the splurge gun cradled in the elbow of her right arm, not pointing, but everything about it was a pointing. Tubing curled like veins. The trigger was the color of cherryade. She had wound a ribbon around the nozzle as if it were a throat that needed dignity. When she shifted, the metal rail by the ladder made an old church noise, one of the small ones you only hear when you’re the kind of person who listens for the end.

“You brought your mop,” Josephine said. Her voice behaved as though the room belonged to it first. “That’s fair. I brought my trumpet.”

“I keep it in the corner,” Ragan said, and nodded toward the alcove where the tools leaned in the posture of men at a bus stop. “Some lies I only tell my mother.”

“The exponential,” Josephine said, not as a correction but as a hymn title. She looked down to where she had dusted a spiral on the tiles, the smallest loop inside the bigger, again and again until the ant-tracks had turned it into galaxies. “You want to know what I mean. I’ll show you. It’s just doubling. It’s just breath on breath. I can make a bloom that makes another bloom, and every person with their hands on a phone will think they can be my gardener. You understand? It’s gentle until it isn’t. That’s how love works too.”

“I understand multiplication,” Ragan said. “We ran out of cups one Christmas and learned quick.” She kept her eyes on Josephine’s mouth because that was where the acceleration would show. “Your number five is in your throat. Spit it out or swallow it. Don’t make a child decide for you.”

“You keep saying child,” Josephine said, with the patience of someone teaching a stubborn letter how to sound. “I never said child. You put that in my mouth.”

“You left space for it,” Ragan said. “The story put it there when you made it a count. And now every idiot playing along is looking for smaller feet to make the picture sharper. You know this. You designed for it. You’ll say you didn’t, because you think you’re the only one religious enough to mean well.”

There were many ways this could have gone and in most of them the police tried to be loud. There were uniforms two streets away trying to be quiet instead, and Declan stood in the vestibule with his hood down, because someone had finally told him his ears made him look like a man who listened. He had told the constables to lock the back gate and then had relented and told them to go boil water because Ragan had said there would be time if there was tea. In the office, the analyst was sifting posts and timelines as if they were sand in which a ring had hidden itself. Half the town was awake online with the ugly gladness of watching something wrong that might for once be solvable.

“Do you want witnesses,” Ragan asked, because it seemed kind to ask even if the answer was already written in the sugar.

“I want a choir,” Josephine said. She lifted the splurge gun and squeezed the trigger halfway, enough that the pump discovered its throat and the syrup remembered that it could be air. The first spray drew a pale rope across the tiles. It hissed just a little, an intimacy. “We’re singing. They’ll harmonize. The kind ones will argue about how I’m sick. The sad ones will say it is art. The dangerous ones will make more.”

“And the wise ones,” Ragan said. She didn’t move her feet. “What do they do.”

“They wash,” Josephine said, and almost smiled. “They get down on the floor with rags they didn’t ask for and remove the outlines before they pass for borders.” She lifted the gun and painted a curve and then another, quicker this time. The foam grew out and up of itself, finding shape like fungus, like grief. It made a ring that begged to be stepped in and a second ring to ask politely for the other foot. The ants were delighted and lost in equal measure. “The exponential,” she whispered, more for herself. “Now watch.”

The phone she had strapped to the rail was already live. The red dot knew its duty and the comments were marching up the screen with the confidence of platitudes. Someone from Columbus wanted to be seen. Someone from the Philippines asked for a song and got a cascade of sharp-throated laughing. There were hearts because there are always hearts. There were the first warnings too, earnest and polite, because some people still think that telling the tide about the moon will remind it which way to go.

Ragan stepped forward onto the sugar’s smallest loop. The foam took her weight and then resented it, trying to lift and hold and stick, behaving like a child being asked to make a decision it didn’t want to make. It clung to the tread of her boot and made a sucking sound like a kiss overheard through a wall. She felt her mistake where her ankle met the old injury, a lightning quick that decided to be loyal. She could have gone down, and in the second where she would have fallen she thought of the boy at the quay and she thought of the one who would be number five in the heads of strangers and she made her weight into a prayer and stayed up.

“Don’t,” Josephine said, and it was not a command you would give an adversary. She came forward two steps as if towards a baby near a pond. “You’ll ruin it. You’ll hurt.” She did not say the word that had sat in the room all along like a friend with a bad cough. She did not say love.

“I was born to ruin it,” Ragan said. “Ask anyone who needed a door closed around here. Ask anyone who thought they could step forever.” She lifted her foot and it made a string of sugar from her heel to the floor that took a second to decide whether to stay with the room or the woman. It chose the woman. She bent and peeled it and set it down where there were fewer ants. “I’m going to get my bucket.”

“There’s no water,” Josephine said reflexively, and then heard herself and shut her eyes and laughed once, a breath out that was the opposite of a laugh. “All your water is a memory.”

“Tap in the staff room,” Ragan said, because this was not a class of riddles and she had gone to work in places where people needed plain answers. She kept her hands visible when she stepped out of the ring, and saw, with the corner of her eye that always kept a tally, how Josephine flinched less at movement than sound. She told Declan with her shoulders. He understood with his ribs.

She came back with a bucket and the mop and a handful of old towels. She moved with the care of someone dressing an infant and not a floor. The first wipe smeared the spiral as if turning it into a different creature. She felt the resistance. She watched the ants climbing onto a rolled edge of foam like refugees and something instinctive in her wanted to fling the towels into the bin and burn the building down rather than drown them. She looked up and met Josephine’s eyes and the look was a sentence with no punctuation.

“I have a biscuit in my pocket,” Ragan said. “You can tell me later that it’s the same as laying honey in a trap. For now, tell your lads which corner is not a death. I’ll make islands.”

Josephine knelt without looking at the camera. The phone that was watching the whole became less important than the hand that reached into the pocket and broke the biscuit into exact quarters. She laid them across a strip of foam so precise you would think she had a ruler under her thumb. She breathed on the sugar in a way that made it heat for a second and remembered, irrelevantly and completely, that once she had breathed on a sleeping foot in a bed and watched a person she loved return to their own body.

“Here,” she said, to the ants, as if they too belonged to a neighborhood. “Here, small hearts. Visit and go. No one’s catching you tonight.” She used the edge of the ribbon from the nozzle to coax a little bridge for them, a ribbon used as a lever because love is a repurposing. “If you’re going to mop,” she added without looking up, “go behind me. Don’t erase the parts I’ve promised.”

“You promised them the path,” Ragan said. “You promised them safe. I’m not erasing that.” She wiped a wider arc around the path, making it bigger where it had been too narrow for a line of ants to pass without elbowing, which was a ridiculous thought to have about ants. The foam liquified under the mop and then found the towel and tried to dry again, a stubbornness that made it human. “You promised the Internet something else,” she added. “What are you going to do about that promise.”

“Give them what they always get,” Josephine said. Her tone had changed in that way a cloud changes the temperature of a street. “Half of what they asked for and double of what they don’t deserve. I brought you here to be the one who knows how to make the second half smaller.”

Declan was a silhouette in the doorway. The word he did not say was “armed.” The word he did not need to say was “waiting.” He had a phone face-up in his palm with the quiet group thread open, the one with the three names and the one emoji nobody else used in messages that mattered. He typed the kettle is on and the analyst sent back an icon that looked like a staircase pretending to be a graph and Declan thought of Mrs. Frazer and her tin of biscuits and then of the time when he had been too quick in a different hallway and had stepped on a boy’s hand before he knew it was a hand.

“All right,” Josephine said suddenly, as if she’d heard his thought cross the room and needed to break it on her knee. “We’ll do it this way. I’ll show them blossoming and not bones. I’ll show them the part of the foot that is brave. You can hold the bucket up to the camera so they learn what rescue looks like. They will not like it. The dangerous ones will call us cowards. But the hungry ones might stay home for a night and put away their saucepans and their ropes.”

“You’re talking like an evangelist,” Ragan said. “You came to preach, not to marry.”

“What else is there,” Josephine said. She moved with a steadiness that made other people’s hands steady too, and the splurge gun sang its small motor song as she traced a figure around the deep end. It was wings now, impossible white wings built from foam and frill, hung with sugar threads that tugged on the air. “Once I learned to kneel beside a bed and call the terrible thing by a gentle name, there was no going back.”

“Say her name,” Ragan said, because the room had earned the weight of it.

“Elle,” Josephine said, and when she said it, her face did not break, and the room did, a little. “Eleanor if you were cross with her and her mother was in the next chair. Elle when it was just the night nurse and the twenty-minute window when the morphine was an art museum, and we looked and looked.” She dipped the nozzle and a new spray joined the wing, a short curve that made the whole look like a moth about to decide.

“You don’t have to make the world a museum,” Ragan said. “It’s a street. It has puddles. It has boys who pretend to fall and men who do. It has Mrs. Frazer who can’t hear you unless she puts her hearing in, God love her, and she still told me where to find you. If you freeze every step, we’ll all be statues. You won’t like feeding the pigeons.”

“You’re fond of pigeons,” Josephine said, in the private tone of a sister. “You’d have liked the girl I loved and she would have liked your mop.”

Something moved in the doorway behind Declan and stopped because Ragan had told Marie McCloskey, the youngest constable, that there were some doors you entered like a prayer. Marie held two mugs of tea with the fearlessness of someone who had burned her mouth enough times to consider heat a minor god. She put the mugs down near the rails and glared at the ants as if daring them to resettle. The live comments noticed the mugs and were confused for three seconds at the fact of cups inside a spectacle. It was the best three seconds of the night.

“Show me your exponential,” Ragan said. “Show me the moment where the number tips from two to four to eight to the part where we lose count. Show me how to stop it at seven.”

Josephine sighed and turned the gun toward the camera. Not directly at it, but near enough that the hiss was audible, the foam a thick comet in the top of the frame. She squeezed, pulse-pulse-pulse, each burst timed to the beat of someone counting off for a song. One, two, three, she thought, and on four it was not foam at all but light. She had blown sugar thin enough that when it dried it caught the overhead lamps and turned them into a veil. If you were watching online and you were alone, you gasped because the room had done a trick you thought only your heart could do. If you were in the room you saw the trick too, but you also saw Ragan step into the frame with the bucket, deliberate, practical, and you saw her tip the edge so a line of water kissed the tile and ran under the foam in a tide so low and careful it built rather than broke.

“Learn this instead,” Ragan said to a million crumbs of attention. She loomed not at all. She was the background and the bruise that would become a story later when someone asked, and she could make it funny. “Learn the weight of a full bucket and the time it takes to carry it. Learn the smallness of your own breath under a roof that remembers more breaths than yours. Learn to mop toward the nearest door.”

There were boos in the comments, and hisses typed by people who kept the heat off at night because they liked the discipline of shivering. There were hearts too, a surprising number that grew into a column of small red flowers because people have muscle memory for tenderness even when they are bored. Someone in a kitchen in Killybegs said aloud to no one, Be grand, and then laughed at their own stinginess. Someone in Ohio shut her laptop and went to sit on the floor in her hall and felt the interesting quiet of not being asked to do a thing.

Josephine lowered the gun and looked up into the stands where boys had dared each other to leap. For a second her face was wrong with wanting. It was so strong she could have raised the nozzle and made the room into a statue of the wanting, and there would have been a kind of peace in that, a false one, white and delicate and fatal to mice. Instead she did what she had promised in the petty vows she had kept with herself since the hospital: she turned the thing she had brought in on herself and let it make her smaller.

“Do you see,” she said, not only to the lens. “I can do it to me. I can carry the weight of my own dare.” She kneaded the trigger and drew a ring around her left ankle that flowered in time-lapse she could feel, a cuff, a chrysanthemum. She let it dry to the point of hunger and then she stepped, and it cracked in the way that is generous rather than breaking in the way that is final. The sound that made was the one she had been carrying: the sound a foot makes when it remembers it is allowed to leave and stay at once.

“Stop there,” Declan said because you have to say a thing like that when the luck is good. His hands had steadied on nothing and he hated himself for needing nothing. “All right. Enough. Enough for now.”

“We’re not finishing,” Josephine said, and put the gun down. She moved her fingers as if shaking water out. “I don’t finish because finishing is death. Don’t worry,” she added to Ragan, and her face learned again how to be kind without expectation. “I don’t want to be finished. I want to be—what’s your word.”

“Between,” Ragan said. “We like between on this side of the water. It’s where most of us live.” She stepped close enough to smell the sugar turned to glass. It smelled like a fair. It smelled like Sunday on a Tuesday. “There’s a door at the back. Leave by it without making me tell anyone the exit. There’s a woman who thinks she’s your neighbor who will know you’re gone and not tell. This is me saying stay away from number five because if it is a child I will hand you over to men who don’t know what a mop is for, and I won’t be the one to say sorrow for you later. This is me saying you’re good at a trick that needs a better job.”

“You want me to be on the payroll,” Josephine said, amused and aghast at once. The ring around her ankle glittered like something a foolish prince would ask for. “You want me to be the saint of floors.”

“I want you to teach people how to see the ground,” Ragan said. “And then sweep after you. There’s a wage for that. It’s not big. It’s what we have. It’s the thing that saved every wall from mildew. The world’s going to keep handing you podiums. Keep saying no. Come hold a bucket where it matters and stop pretending you’re the only one who knows what a small life is worth.”

Josephine bent and broke her own cuff with two firm fingers. It tore with a whisper that made everyone breathe at the same time without knowing they had been holding themselves. She glanced toward the phone and saw the count of eyes watching and smiled at them in a way that held a mirror up. “Log off,” she said, and the comments flooded her with eagerness to disobey. “Log off and touch the thing that tells you you’re alive. The kettle handle. The dog. The bannister your grandfather sanded. I’ll know. I always know.”

She moved toward the back gate and did not run. She put her hand on the white paint that remembered other hands and did not leave a mark because she knew where the dry ended. She looked once more at the moth of sugar over the deep end and then left it to commit itself to air. Declan stepped as if to follow and did not, because Ragan’s shoulder made a weather he preferred. The door shut with a sound like coincidence agreeing to meet you later.

After, there was the mess and the mercy. The towels went into the old washer in the basement that had a personal vendetta against buttons. The ants carried their news back to the places under the skirting where the building’s heart had been revised. The online feed closed with a staccato that moderators recognize as hope and panic at once. The analyst stared at his screen and watched a number become reluctant. He hit refresh three times and it refused to recover its arrogance. He sent the angry triangle to Declan with one of those faces that pretends it’s bored. Declan sent back the kettle and had to wipe his eyes in an irritated way that made him feel fifteen and ungrateful and alive.

In Ibadan, Yinka, who had not slept for thirty hours, set his phone on the shelf above the sink and filmed his wife washing her feet as if she were washing a stranger’s. He said nothing. He filmed the basin and the lemon he cut and the way the skin of a foot takes light when someone loves it with a cloth. He turned off the comments and turned on the captions and wrote: If you are cold, come here. If you are hot, come here. If you are angry, come here. The light in their kitchen said what the words did not. Ten people sent it to ten people and the slope thought about what it had been doing and put its hands in its pockets and kicked a stone and stopped for a drink.

In Ohio, a woman who had once taken a photo of her child’s heel and felt smart about it posted a longer thing that did not go viral because it had sentences and meals in it. She wrote about her grandmother’s basin and the way they used to call Sundays a day for hands. She used the word sorry without expecting applause. People she had not spoken to in three years left small notes that used her name. She slept and had the first dream in months that wasn’t a chase.

By morning the bathhouse smelled like heat trying to remember itself. Ragan had put every window that would open into the position most likely to permit intention. She left the moth up for a while, even after the ants lost interest and returned to their disciplined stupidities. She put a sign near the moth that used many capitals and two words that were a rule and a dare at once: DO NOT. She put a second sign under it that used none and read bring your kettle if you want to fight.

Mrs. Frazer had written to the station again, a note this time in the same brave widow’s hand. She suggested a list of shoes to be collected from the stairwells in her block where people kept them as safeguards against loneliness. She included the detail that the girl on her landing had been singing and had run out of tune on purpose at the end of each line. She enclosed three margarine tokens from 1979 as if they were currency anywhere still. Declan put the tokens in his pocket and could not have told you why he felt luckier.

There was no body that day. The word number sat in the corner of the kitchen and sulked. It was a respite, which is a lie you tell a clock, but they told it anyway. The news ran footage of the moth and tried to decide whether to choose threat or miracle as the lower-third text. A professor with a tie the color of tomatoes said it was a movement and did not look up from his notes to see the moth tilt and break like a joke. A woman with exquisite hair said the word empathy and did not say the word biscuits. A boy at the quay filmed nothing at all and told his friend that nothing would get him more views, and for once he was correct.

That evening, the bathhouse was a town hall for people who don’t like town halls. They came with thermoses. They came with their own mops. They came with their phones off and peered at the moth and stood at the edge of the old deep and whispered to each other the way you do in cathedrals because you want to leave space for every saint and every liar. Ragan thanked them without asking what side they were on because she had learned that sides are something you hold in your mouth when you don’t have bread.

Josephine left a gift on the beech with the nail, because she was the kind who finished a chord. It was not shoes this time. It was a thick square envelope pinned to the bark with a ribbon, and inside was a photograph of the moth that made the moth look older than it was, and underneath that a thin scrap of notebook paper with a single letter drawn on it so carefully the paper might have split. It was L in a script nobody teaches now, learned from a mother’s shopping list perhaps, or from a hospital wristband you look at too long. There was also a line, in a hand that was not steady and therefore true: bring this back to me when you know where to put it.

She did not go far. She went to the river and walked the path that had taught her not to run. She put her hands on the rail and counted to seven and then again. The phone was in her pocket and she did not take it out because she could feel a million hands behind the glass waiting to be fed and she wanted them to starve for a night. The ants along the wall near the stair to the car park had found a smear of ice cream someone had dropped and were arguing in the way that is not argument but a passing on of a hymn.

The world is clever and stupid in equal measure and it proved that by having a copycat in a city with heat different from this one misunderstand a metaphor at the speed of fiber. In Manila, a girl whose mother sold bread on a corner everybody knows set sugar on her sister’s ankles and took a photo because someone she liked had dared her to make sweetness into grout. Her father slapped the phone out of her hand and broke his own heart to be the one to teach a consequence. The girls cried until they washed each other’s feet and then they laughed so hard the neighbors made tea and came out to watch and laugh too. The slope was caught in a moment of its own hilarity. It tripped, as slopes do when someone has moved a stone, and it broke nothing on the way down.

Declan’s graph the next morning looked like a stair deciding to be a bench. He carried it into the bathhouse where the moth had begun to shiver itself into a series of delicate losses. He laid it on the table where swim lessons had once been tallied and said nothing because some numbers you only show to floors. Ragan held the letter L with two fingers like a thimble. She had a feeling behind her eyes like a Sunday. She pressed the L against her palm until the ink came off and made a ghost there, and when Mrs. Frazer came in with a plate of buns she put her hand on the old woman’s shoulder and felt how stout and dear a shoulder can be when it has seen a count or two and stopped one.

“What now,” Declan asked, because you practice asking that when you get out of training and discover that training didn’t.

“Now we go on the knock,” Ragan said. “We go to stairwells and tell them to bring shoes inside. We ask who needs a kettle. We tell them if they’re sad they can come watch a moth die tidy and then help us sweep, and if they’re angry they can carry water up and down the steps until they feel their breath in them. We make a list of people who say ‘splurge’ to see if they’re lonely or just fun with words. We watch the nail and see who touches it with what kind of love.”

“And her,” he said. “When she calls in the letter.”

“She won’t,” Ragan said, because hope is as handsy as fear. “She’ll make me chase the L for a while. That’s our bargain. In the meantime, she’ll make a smaller thing somewhere and call it larger in her own head. And if she brings number five to my door, I’ll take it and put it on a shelf and make her come inside to fetch it.”

She took up the mop because that was what she always did after a speech, small or grand. She dipped it in the bucket and wrung it with her new strength, the one you get when you’ve carried a foolish thing to a conclusion and put it down. The moth gave up its last small shimmer and fell into the pattern of the floor and the floor accepted it as if it had been waiting all winter to be fed. They worked. The day did what days do when you make them help.

Night was always a new animal. It came in and laid its head on the tiles and waited. The online thing, which was a beast without a shepherd, dozed in doorways and woke to howl at pigeons. Josephine sat in her flat with the lights off because sometimes love is dark and sometimes you make it so on purpose. She held her phone between her two hands like something that has to be warmed before it will speak. She typed a message to a group she considered hers and then erased it because she had learned something about words in a blue room. She typed to one person instead.

You can give me a job that is not a muzzle, she wrote to Ragan, and I’ll take it, but only if you don’t make me start tomorrow. I have to take the L out to the river first and hold it in the air and say a letter is just a letter and a girl is a cathedral you do not have the authority to consecrate. I will keep my hands out where you can see them. Use the word trust if you need to. I’ll use the word between.

Ragan’s reply took the time a kettle takes to complain and then settle. The answer was not an answer. It was a photograph of a mop leaning against a wall and a biscuit on the rail of a chair and the corner of a graph where the angry line had decided to be tired. It said, without saying, this is the work, and I’ll be here, and we’ll get sore shoulders and then we’ll sleep and then we’ll do it again. It said, in letters she did not type for fear of injuring the day, stay.

And because sometimes the world is briefly kind, the wind went down to the river and rearranged itself into a shape that felt like a name spoken correctly. The ants took their sermons back to the dark and were eaten by things that needed them. The bathhouse grew warmer by a degree because an old pipe decided it could forgive its own welding. A boy at the quay took off his shoes and put them on his friend’s silly head and laughed like a bell with no church to spoil it. The city held still, almost, a moment longer. Then the phone in a pocket somewhere woke up and asked to be fed again, and the day that knew better put out its hand and said wait.Chapter 5

The council room had been painted an optimistic cream sometime in the last decade, the color you choose when you intend to be reasonable for a long time, and it was too small for the number of chairs someone kept insisting were necessary. A banner from the arts fund hung crooked over a radiator that clicked like an elderly typewriter trying to spell the word money. Ragan sat with her hands flat on the table the way her mother had taught her for funerals and job interviews, and Josephine sat beside her with the splurge gun zipped into a canvas holdall that made it look like a flute someone had been too proud to hire a case for. Declan was across from them, tie slightly wrong on purpose because he had learned it made nervous people feel that he could be enlisted rather than feared. The analyst stood with his paper like a weather report and suggested, with the tense gladness of someone bringing clouds to farmers, that their triangle was lazier today and the slope had done that thing slopes do when you walk down them twice and decide to stretch instead.

“What are we actually asking for,” said a councillor with the voice of a kettle that refuses to whistle, which meant she was not wrong but wanted the answer to be shaped like a coin. “Because if it’s a line item I can fight the budget for it, and if it’s a mood I can write a speech. If it’s both, we’ll have to ask Mrs. Kelly to bake, and she does not share her kitchen on weekdays.”

“A bucket, ten mops, biscuits we pay for and not by passing hats, and a night when the bathhouse is open for what we’ll call a rehearsal,” Ragan said, and she kept her tone practical to keep the room from flying too high. “It will not be posted, and if the press arrives, we’ll give them tea and tell them to use their pencils for crosswords. It’s for people to see each other and practice saying no to the thing that lives in the blue light. We’ll call it Between Night, and everyone will think it’s silly until they go home and sleep for the first time since this started.”

“And a fee,” Josephine said, and the way she said the word made it clear she hated needing it and had sworn to require it anyway. “For the person who brings the buckets and the person who plays the trumpet.” She raised an eyebrow as if daring someone to make her name the instrument properly. “And for the old woman who will sit near the door and read the names of the ones who come, not to keep them to use later, but to say them aloud once so they feel the room like a hand.”

The councillors did that thing all committees do when confronted with a request that is both small and old. They looked at each other to see who would be the first to agree that this was the type of thing people do in towns when the national mood is a word you don’t want on your invitation. Declan slid the angry-soon-to-be-placid triangle onto the table between a man who wore his lapel pin as if it had been suntanned there and a woman who took minutes with the concentration of someone who knows how fights begin and how long they take to end. The minutes-taker nodded first because she had a grandson who had filmed a heel and had cried afterward in her kitchen as if the bread had failed him personally.

“Between Night,” she said, and smiled at the way the words sat together like a pair of shoes under a chair. “I’ll put down three pounds for biscuits, and if you laugh I’ll take them back.”

“Put me down for tea and the electric,” said the kettle-voiced councillor. “Mrs. Kelly can come on a Saturday if she wants to be rude about it, and I will carry the sugar myself. Sarge, if you want a sign, I know a man with vinyl who owes me for an election he won without deserving it.”

The sign went up above the bathhouse door two days later in letters blue enough to look like water if the light went your way. Between Night sat there with a date and a time and a note underneath in the oldest font the sign-maker had, one that pretended you had to squint to read it. No phones, no photographs, hands clean on entry and cleaner leaving. Ragan stood under it with Declan and watched people pass and pretend not to read it, the way you watch a menu outside a restaurant you’re not sure you can afford. Josephine came late and stood to the side of the step with her back to the bricks like someone preparing to be forgiven or arrested, and she held the holdall as if it contained both futures and she was too tired to decide.

The week between was not quiet because nothing in the town had learned silence in decades, but it did a passable impression of a lull. Yinka’s video of the lemon and the basin found its own tributary and went into houses that hadn’t intended to be kind that day, and nobody made a show of their relief. The girl in Ohio with the grandmother’s basin got a postcard from someone who had served her at the petrol station once, and it said only that the bread had been good that morning, and would she pass that along to her mother. The Manila father bought buns from his daughter’s friend’s mother and did not attempt to make a lesson of it because you do not need to instruct a bakery in how to be a saint.

Less public things went wrong as they always do when a city is reminded it has hands. Ragan’s mother misjudged a step in the dark and bruised her hip, which she announced like the weather and refused to charge to anyone’s account. The boiler in the bathhouse made a noise like a coin inside a throat, and Josephine crawled under the cabinets with a torch because she could stand small spaces if she chose them and could not if someone else did. Declan got two messages from names he had not saved that boiled down to the simple request that he try not to make a slogan out of grief, and he wrote them back at three in the morning with apologies large enough to look foolish but small enough to be true.

On Thursday, a copycat in Glasgow wrote the hashtag on the sidewalk with sugar that the first rain took without effort, which taught him something the teacher had not, and he carried a bucket for an hour on Friday to repay whoever had swept. On Saturday morning, the fox on the bench in the park lost a chip of paint near one eye, and Josephine stood in front of it with a small brush and fixed it as if she could correct a childhood that had refused to straighten its tie for photographs. She had the letter L in her pocket and took it out and drew it in the air and put it away again because she had not yet found the place where it would consent to live.

Between Night began with a line that did not feel like a line because no one in it wanted to win. They came in pairs and threes and as individuals granted the night for their own good by mothers with the calm meanness of long love. They stood under the sign and put their phones in a basket without sighing as if they had been waiting years for the thought that there is company where the pocket does not know your name. Mrs. Frazer sat on a folding chair with a clipboard and wrote the names as if copying a recipe she meant to memorize, and people spelled themselves carefully because they liked the attention. She did not say the words aloud because she did not need to discover who had never heard their own sounded in that room before; she merely made a small check and smiled at every second vowel like a blessing.

Inside, the moth had been mopped into memory and replaced with a line of chairs and a stack of towels that asked nothing political of anyone. There were buckets near the deep end and the old ladders wore ribbon because the room liked to be dressed for company. The air was a degree warmer than honest, and Ragan could see her father in a corner of her eye like a man who had come early to sit by the wall and judge how a crowd holds itself together. She had laid a rug near the door with a basin on it and a lemon she did not intend to cut unless someone asked. Declan carried the tea and spilled some deliberately into the saucer to prove he was mortal and could be forgiven.

“We’ll do no speeches,” Ragan said to the first cluster of hands, feet, and shoulders, and she didn’t regret the contradiction because she pronounced it like a promise. “We’ll do water and we’ll do rest and if you need to say something say it to a mop because it will keep the secret better than any of us. If you have questions about safety, ask the woman at the door because she’ll tell you the truth and not the policy version. If you’ve come to stare, stare at your own shoes until you remember who polished them last.”

It was ridiculous and exact and the only thing that could have worked in a city that has survived by making tea when it should have made arrests and making arrests when it should have made stew. People knelt and washed their own feet because they were not saints and did not trust a stranger with their skin, and when they were done they washed the person beside them in the kneeling way you do when you decide you have permission. They cried a little as people do when they are in public and determined to be dignified and failing in ways that make rooms warmer. They laughed because someone told a joke about toes that could have haunted them in another context and saved them here because the timing was good and the floor understood comedy.

Josephine avoided the first and second basins and then went to the third and sat like a student who has agreed to stop disrupting class. She took off her shoes and then her socks, which made her feet look more narrow than anyone would have guessed from the way she walked, and she put them in the water and closed her eyes in the way people of faith reserve for moments when the world and their god happen to agree. She had the splurge gun out of its case by then, not to use, but to let the room see what it looked like when art behaved and did not ask for casualties. Declan watched the nozzle like a man who has learned the difference between a trumpet and a horn because someone sang while he listened.

“Are you going to keep it,” Ragan murmured, kneeling beside her with a towel and a lemon because she liked holding both tools at once, one for the now and one for the next time the air disagreed with skin. “We could put it in the office with the rackets and the trophies. You’d hate that and I’d love it and that seems as fair as we are going to get.”

“I’ll keep it,” Josephine said, and she opened her eyes not to look at Ragan but to watch the ceiling where iron knew the shape of a century. “Or I’ll melt it down and make a ladle. The world thinks tools only become weapons, and I want to give it a different story so it doesn’t stay in the corner with its hackles up.”

Marie McCloskey arrived late with a set of bandages because she had gone to a call about a man sleeping under the bridge and ended up talking to him about soup for twenty minutes. She washed her hands, her face, and then her boots, which made three men near the stairs decide not to tease her because she had made a ritual out of her own work without asking any of them to acknowledge it. Mrs. Frazer came inside with her clipboard and sat while someone massaged lotion into her palms the way you do with children when they are too restless to sleep, and her hearing aid buzzed a little and she did not apologize for the insect in her ear.

At the doorway near the white-painted gate, a shadow hung in the corner and then committed to being a man, and Ragan’s shoulders found a posture she had not asked for since she had returned her badge. He was not the danger she had been rehearsing, but he was danger’s cousin, which is often trouble enough. He held his phone like a doctrine and had the expression of someone who thinks a secret is a hole you can sell tickets to. He stepped inside with his head high and then stopped because one of the old swimmers, a woman with a cap and a sense of who she had been at nineteen, put her hand on his sleeve and said his name as if she had taught him to pronounce it.

“You’ll take off your shoes,” she said, and it was not a request but it was kind. “Or you’ll go home and do it there where there’s no one to watch you,” she added, and tipped her chin toward the basket where the phones were sleeping. He made a noise like a sneeze that did not arrive, and then did a thing that saved his week. He took off his trainers and lined them up under the chair and sat down on the floor, which had once been water, and put his heels into the basin and did not look anyone in the eye for the length of a hymn. He stayed an hour and left with his laces tied differently because someone had shown him a trick and he had not known he needed one.

When the first Between Night ended, the room felt like a bed where fifty people had slept and no one had spoken for the first few minutes after waking. The towels were wet and earnest. The cups had lipstick on them because some people do not have the skill or desire to drink invisibly. The basins had lemon rinds floating like boats for a small cautionary tale. Ragan took down the sign that said DO NOT over the place where the moth had been and folded it and put it under her arm because she intended to tell it a better story than a command usually gets. Josephine put the splurge gun back into the holdall with the care you use when you put a child into a jacket that still smells like the last time you took them to the sea.

There was a girl at the end of the hall who had waited until everyone else had gone because she had a face that had learned the advantage of small crowds. She had a bag with her as if she had planned to run, and she held it with the tension of someone who had a plan and was asking to be talked out of it without having to surrender the pen that had written it. She had calluses on her heels and a new tattoo on an ankle that said not a word but a small, angry star. She asked if this was the place for the feet thing, and her mouth shaped the words with the care of someone handling glass.

“It is,” Josephine said, and that was important because if Ragan had said it it would have been a rule and if Declan had said it it would have been a test. “It is the place for the feet thing, and it’s also the place for tea. Do you require sugar,” she added, just to make her own face remind itself that the joke still worked on her tongue when she was careful not to harm with it.

The girl came in and sat on the rug and took off her boots and put her feet into the basin with the solemnity of someone putting a letter into a postbox that had known her grandmother’s handwriting. She looked at the lemon floating and reached out and pushed it around the circle with one finger like a game she’d invented at seven, and then she began to speak in the way people do when they have been arrested by silence and then pardoned by a room.

“My brother said if I filmed me doing the challenge he’d give me the money he owes me for the electric,” she said, and the two constables near the tea table found suddenly that the kettle would not settle unless they put their hands on it very carefully. “But I didn’t want to do it with my face. He said it didn’t need my face. And then I thought that’s how you get into trouble, isn’t it, when you think it’s not your face. And then I came here because Mrs. Frazer said sometimes people will tell you the truth if you let them have your feet for ten minutes.”

“Mrs. Frazer is not wrong,” Ragan said, and she didn’t smile because the distance between the girl’s face and tears was a street where you didn’t ride a bicycle. “We can give you ten minutes and then ten minutes more and then we can tell your brother that debts aren’t paid with panic. If he needs the electric on, he’ll talk to us about a kettle not a dare.”

They did not fix the girl’s life because they were not witches and even if they had been the kind of witches the town sometimes believed in, they would have respected free will and the time it takes to see oneself and the dull heroism of the next decision. They washed her feet and they sat her for a while with a biscuit and a map of bus routes to places she could go where people would write down her name and help her say it more often. Josephine felt the letter L in her pocket and thought of the girl’s ankle, and for the first time she considered that the letter might not be hers to return but this girl’s to borrow for a while until she found the word she wanted to spell.

They closed late. They always did because closing on time feels like missing a friend by three minutes on a platform. The last towel went onto the rack with a sound like gratitude, and the floor had that sweet damp smell that makes people who’ve had a good swim smile at their own coats. Declan took the bins out because he had forgotten to do it the night before and because he had said to himself that he would be the man who takes out bins when someone better than him needs to sit down, and Ragan let him because he needed the small glory. Josephine put her palm against the wall near the old depth markers and felt the ghosts of nineteen toes in a row, and she apologized to them for bringing cameras into their room even in her head.

At home later, in the small flat that had learned all her night noises and forgave them, she took out the letter and placed it on the table and wrote a different L next to it in pencil because she wanted to see if the paper would instruct her in scale. She wrote it once and again, small then elaborate, and it began to look less like a symbol that had held her hostage and more like a hinge a door could actually swing on. She put the old L into an envelope and wrote no address on it and put it into the drawer with the photograph of the hospital foot because she had made a bargain with her day that she would not take that picture out again this week. She slept with the window open to let the river teach her a lesson about the continuous.

The next morning, two things happened differently than they would have if no one had carried a bucket or a basin on Thursday night. A boy who had come to the quay to fall did not, because someone had left a sign there overnight that read in not very good paint This Is Not An Audience, and he stared at it until the word audience became absurd and small and could be put in a pocket and returned to later without harm. And the man with the doctrine phone woke with the urge to post and followed it into his kitchen, and then he looked down at his laces, which he had tied in the new way, and he put the phone down again and made eggs and thought about calling his mother, which is the river inside a city for some men and the only one that has not been culverted.

The slope softened. The triangle lay down like a dog at the foot of the table. The angry thread of comments in the place where Josephine had once been the host of a party grew moss and then daisies and then a small shrub that required attention no one on that thread was able to give, so it colored itself with birds and went out to a field that did not need a password. There were still clever cruelties in other corners, as there will be until someone reprograms the part of the brain that calls hunger entertainment, but the center loosened. The bathhouse became a place a few people wanted to stop by for a quiet that did not feel like abandonment, and Mrs. Frazer brought a jar of gooseberry jam because she wanted to watch ants consider the ethics of sour.

Trouble, which is unembarrassed by progress and considers itself immortal until proven otherwise, waited until the night the river swelled with a secret wind and then came into the city by the back door. It was not theatrical; it did not wear a mask. It chose the kind of apartment block that forgets to lock the downstairs door and that keeps two potted plants in the hall more as an apology than an aesthetic. It chose a stair where the shoes were outside because all the mothers had agreed that the smell would not come into their kitchens, and because superstition is often true about sharp things and is therefore indulged. It chose a pair of small trainers with light-up heels and a drawing on the side of a fox that had been colored in with biro. It took the shoes and left a note in crayon that said love is faster barefoot and signed it with a hashtag large enough to be a slap.

By morning, the stair was a courtroom. The mothers stood in their doors and held their dishcloths like flags. The children sat on the steps as if attending a school they would not be called upon in. The noise a room makes when it selects a suspect without evidence began to build, and it would have climbed to the floor above where the woman who never said hello lived if Mrs. Frazer had not been walking by with eggs and paused because the air changes temperature when a floor becomes a stage. She stood at the bottom of the stair and called for quiet and received it because her voice had been borrowed by Sunday mornings and therefore could cut bread without bruising it.

“Whoever wrote this is a fool,” she said, and she held up the note as if it were a scrap of recipe that she could decipher. “And whoever left their shoes in the hall will now bring them inside and put them under their beds and take the first step toward growing up. If this is a child’s trick, we will make a plan and if it is an adult’s, you will see me at my worst, which is not a sight anyone chooses twice.” She handed the note to a girl who had not cried yet and told her to put it in the bin with a flourish because ceremony is how you keep fear from thinking it’s the bride.

Ragan arrived with Declan and Marie and did not put on her old voice because it did not belong here. She spoke names and listened for the shape of one that did not fit, and it was the boy with the coin-dog who had once sat on a bench with Josephine, who looked too innocent and therefore caught himself with a blush. He had a sister whose shoes had been taken and a mother who had not learned how to be angry without adopting it as a habit, and he kept saying we were only looking and that phrase made him older by six weeks each time it left his mouth. They found the shoes in a bin in the lane behind the block, cradled as if they were sleeping, and the note under them replicated in a careful hand as if the first were a draft and this version the one intended to last.

A week earlier, this would have fed the slope, and there would have been a post and a flash of attention and then the particular ache of trying to decide whether it was wise to be disgusted publicly. Between Night gave them a different reflex. Marie took out the lemon and cut it in half and made the children hold it and describe the smell until their faces reminded their bodies that they had noses. Declan took the boy and asked him to help him tie a knot in some rope they kept for mending things and told him this was a better trick because you can rescue with it. Ragan sat with the mother and asked for a story that did not include the words should or if only, and she held the ugly thing still until it wanted to stop showing off.

Josephine came late as always and picked the biro fox out of the bin and put it in her pocket because she might paint a better version on a real object and leave it somewhere the child would find. She sat on the step where the shoes had been and watched the ants try the angle where the tile met the wooden skirting and fail three times and then make a bridge with their bodies. She felt the letter L heat against her thigh and, without making a ceremony of it, she stood and went down the street to the old outdoor shop where the owner never asked questions because his own past had too many, and she bought a strip of cheap brass letters with sticky backs meant for letterboxes in a street with better fences.

She went to the bathhouse and climbed the stairs to the gallery where the old painted sign had lost its O from LIFEGUARD in 1989 and had become a joke teenagers told each other when they thought they were original. She cleaned the space with a rag that had been her shirt once and took the L and pressed it where the O had been, not because she had forgiven the letter for going missing, but because she preferred a word that asked a person to stand up rather than the one that asked them to be rescued. It read LIFELGUARD now, which was wrong and perfect, and she laughed in the way a body does when a secret sits down beside it and offers it water.

That night, the rain came down with the intention of being a sermon, and the river made a noise at the bridge that suggested there would be no school for the fish tomorrow. The bathhouse took it, as it had taken worse, and it complained like an old king at the end of a dynasty but did not yield. Ragan put out buckets with the ease of someone who has spent a life balancing and Josephine made sugar into gasket for a moment or two where water wanted to try a new path and Declan stood in the vestibule and told three different men in three different voices that they could help by carrying and not by leading and all three of them liked him better for it. The moth had been folded into the floor now, and the floor used the memory of it to persuade the water to take a different shape than disaster.

The week did not end because weeks in that town had given up on endings in favor of pauses, but it paused in a place where the noise in the head of an average citizen was just below boiling. The online horde found a new trouble to dress in slogans for a day, and then another, and in the gap the bathhouse hosted a second Between Night that did not require a name because it had become the way Thursdays were. Ragan slept for six hours and woke because she had dreamed of her father buying mops and realized she had never seen him in that aisle in life and that the sorrow she felt was a clean kind and not the dirty kind that stains the day. Josephine sat at her table and wrote three sentences in a book that she would not have called a diary because that would have required an apology, and each sentence had two adjectives fewer than she would have used a month ago because the ground no longer needed the extra lace.

On a Sunday morning, the fox on the bench had a ribbon around its painted neck, and someone had put there a note in the script that mothers teach when they are not tired: this city loves your feet if you keep them. The ants understood none of it and all of it at once and went about their old business as if the world had been designed for them alone. They were not wrong, and that was not unkind.Chapter 6

The week woke with the ragged optimism of a shirt dried near a radiator, warm in spots and shy under the arms. The sign above the bathhouse door kept its blue and a few more fingerprints, the kind a town leaves when it claims something without voting on it. The fox on the bench had a ribbon that had been knotted properly and then ruined by a small hand so that it looked stern and delighted at once. On the pavements near the park, someone had chalked hearts, and someone else had tried to turn them into feet by adding toes, which made them look less like anything and more like the way love misremembers itself when told from a distance.

Ragan took her mother out to buy milk with the reverence of someone rehearsing for a larger care. The hip had bruised into a map that did not instruct, but her mother’s stride had re-found its old quarrel with the curb and seemed happy enough to lose with dignity. The grocer kept the door propped open because the weather had chosen to be moody rather than meaningful, and he had taped a notice to the glass that read KETTLES HALF PRICE IF YOU PROMISE to which he’d added in biro to CLEAN THEM. Her mother asked for stamps and a package of porridge with the persistence of someone who believes in the digestive system as a civic duty. She called Declan “that boy” and then corrected herself and called him “that detective” and then made a face at the ceiling that meant both.

“Are you watching the sign,” she asked, and Ragan had never considered that a sign could require guardianship, but of course it could. “It’s hung at the angle of a person who won’t compromise.”

“I’m watching it,” Ragan said. “And the world is watching us watch it.”

“If they see the angle, they’ll forgive the paint,” her mother said. “And if they don’t, they’ll write letters. I’ll answer.”

At the window of her own flat, Josephine watched light move across the nail in the beech the way you watch a scar stop shouting. She had propped the L against a glass on the table so she could see it from the kitchen, and she practiced a skill she had learned too late: leaving a thing in view and not touching it until she had something to say to it that wasn’t a threat. Her queue at work had not slowed; the world had not accepted the bath of lemons as a permanent fix for its itch. She clicked through a hundred and seven tickets, flagged three dozen, escalated nine with notes that were more precise than policy deserved. She attended a meeting where an earnest man with a grin like a drawer of spoons talked about community partnerships and she turned off her camera so she could press her hand to her sternum and ask the body to stay in the call.

“We’re seeing interesting offline practices,” the spoon-drawer said. “Organic dampening. It’s rare. We’d like a case study. We’re thinking ‘Between Nights: How Community Rituals Counteract Online Harm.’ We’ll need photos. We’ll need consent forms. We’ll need a hero. We’ll need a villain. We’ll need a graph that looks like a story.”

“You’ll need a mop,” Josephine said, because a private window encourages bravery. “You’ll need to not say case study. You’ll need to not ask me to narrate the grief out of it so your shareholders can sleep. It’s not content. It’s a room. We can’t put an embed in a room.”

“I’m on your side,” the man said, his smile faltering like cutlery realizing it had been set at the wrong place on the table. “We can resource—a donation—signal-boost—”

“If you want to boost something,” she said, and felt herself try to be kinder and succeed halfway. “Boost a kettle fund. Buy towels without your logo. Pay a woman with a clipboard and a hearing aid to sit by a door and write names. Don’t write about her. Don’t write about me either. Don’t speak in hero/villain. Speak in biscuit.”

When the call ended, a tiny message popped under the rest like a beetle with a coin on its back. It was from Mae, the only person at the company who spelled her name the way it was pronounced and who wrote as if email were a street. You’re red on three internal lists, it read, which means you’re good, and here’s the bad part: the page you used to run while you were asleep has been copied by a man who writes like he is afraid of women. They’re calling it AirInsideAir. It’s ugly. It’s stealing your sentence and it will make you feel like you lit a match and someone found a house. Also: I’m making a kettle fund. Tell me where to send.

Declan went to a school and stood in a room that had the smell of varnish and glue and a poster of a mountain with the word Perseverance under it, which had forgotten to put a hand on anyone’s shoulder in the last ten years. He had not brought a slideshow because children deserve better lies than adults. He told them about buckets and about the map a floor is. He told them that if someone asks you to film your feet it’s as intimate as being asked to film your face and that if they disagree they’re predators with better photography. He watched the boy near the radiator draw a letter when he thought no one was looking, an L with too much bar at the tail, and make it into a fox by accident. He wrote lifelguard on the board and then rubbed out the first l and left the remains to confuse the teacher after lunch and smiled because the room had laughed.

At the bathhouse, the old painted LIFEGUARD did its new wrong work proudly. Children came in after school and pointed up and invented reasons, because the city trains its young early to make systems out of mischief. A pair of girls decided it stood for Let In Friends, Everyone Guard Us And Remember Days, and Josephine, who was sweeping and trying to pretend the broom was superior to the mop only because they had different talents, nearly asked them to write it down to use as policy. A boy arrived carrying a life ring he claimed he’d rescued from a skip, and it was good enough that Ragan put it under the sign where the O had been and for a week the letters read LIFELGUARD but with an implied circle that made even the old swimmers stop and feel their hearts look for rhythm.

The new thing online was uglier precisely because it wanted to be smart. The page called itself AirInsideAir and wrote the phrase in a minuscule that made it coy. It used Josephine’s sentence without credit and posted photographs of feet that were wrong in some way you felt before you could describe: the light too exact, the ankle too lonely, the sugar too clean. The captions had the confidence of a man who looks in mirrors to check his soul and finds nothing alarming. They made puzzles that were really maps, trivia that were really countdowns. People tagged each other in the comments with the thirst of watchers. It had a local tilt. It knew where the bins were kept, where the gates were white, where the beech nail was.

The first place it wanted them to come was the roof of a car park where the wind had nothing to stop it but itself. The puzzle was generous: three lines about a river seen from above, a photo of a gull’s foot that was actually a hand with bandaids, a word ladder you could climb even if you had the wrong shoes. Declan brought the quiet ones. Marie made a face at the sky and wished for heavier wool. Ragan climbed the stairs with a steadiness that told each flight it would not be asked to confess. They reached the top and found a circle of sugar drawn with the boredom of someone who believes themselves to be interesting. In the center, a drone with ribbon on its legs sat like a small god waiting to be told to be awful.

“Jesus,” Marie said. “They brought a toy.”

“It’s always the toys,” Declan said, already kneeling to feel the batteries and the heat. “They can’t help themselves. You give them a prop and they’ll call it narrative.”

“Where’s the owner,” Ragan asked, and that question took the shape of a boy too old to call himself boy and too young to be forgiven quickly. He came around the corner of the stairwell holding a controller as if it were a rosary and the wind had the gall to hit his face with the honesty of a mother. He tried three expressions before his muscles learned that none would fit in this weather: defiance, charm, grievance. He ended on the expression he had the least practice with: waiting to be told what to do.

“You going to film me,” he asked, not with strength.

“You’re not that special,” Marie said, bracing the drone with a hand as if it might decide to fly anyway. “You’re the fourth in two days who thought the sky would love him better than the ground. We brought a bag for it.”

“It’s not against the law,” he tried, and then looked at Ragan as if she might be more lenient because her coat was older.

“It’s against the weather,” Ragan said. “And the weather has a better solicitor than you. Is this yours.”

“I’m doing a series,” he said. “A friend of mine told me to make an entrance. They said feet from above is fresh. They said if you do it big the algorithm—”

“You don’t own fresh,” Declan said, kind but efficient as he unplugged a thing and made another thing have no use. “You don’t own the algorithm. It owns you and it’s a poor landlord. Take the ribbon off your prop. Go home. Put your hands in dishwater and perform for plates. If you want punishment, stay.”

“I’ll get you a list of drone shops,” Marie added, as if this were an arrangement and not the salvation of a boy’s next hour. “We go on the knock with lists these days. If you’re going to play with clouds, at least tell us where you bought them.”

He deflated with the peculiar relief of the forgiven who have not yet accepted dignity. He handed over the controller, and his hands were the hands of someone who had once known string and then forgot it. He backed away with the precise speed of a fox deciding a garden is not worth the alarm. On a lower level of the car park, a woman with a bag of oranges glanced up and pretended not to have seen the rehearsal for his future.

That night, the bell in Ragan’s mother’s flat rang as if swung by a wind rather than a finger. When Ragan went she found her mother at the door with her coat buttoned in a sequence that would have confused a lighthouse. Her mother was holding her purse and her hearing aid buzzed with the determination of a bluebottle.

“I was going to Mass,” she said, and then blinked at the clock that lied politely about night. “Unless it’s morning. I hate that in a day, when it won’t say what it is.”

“It’s night,” Ragan said. “It’s the kind you think ship captains understand. Unless they don’t, and that’s why so many ships end up in the news.” She buttoned the coat in the proper order and found herself complaining to the coat about the fact of buttons on a woman who had grown tired of them. “Do you want air.”

“I want the river,” her mother said. “I want the bit of rail where I can see over and the light on the water makes me think of being less married to my own worry.”

“Do you want company,” Ragan asked, and her mother tilted her head in a way that said I want to want it.

“Take me halfway and then pretend you’re leaving me alone,” she said. “But don’t.”

They went together in a quiet that had the weight of years. The path had learned their steps and gave way in the old places and resisted in the new. Halfway to the rail they met Josephine because that is how a town is built: the person you are thinking of appears as if the thought had been a bell. Josephine had the L in her pocket and a weird loyalty to the way the cold burned the inside of her nose.

“You,” Ragan’s mother said, with the suspicion of a woman who has softened in the wrong places and has the sense to expect betrayal. “Are you the one with the sugar.”

“I’m the one with the mop today, Mrs. McGill,” Josephine said, using the name that made doors agree to open. “My sugar is on a diet. It’s learning to be useful. Are you wanting the rail.”

“I’m wanting the river,” her mother said. “You a good way to it.”

“I’ve learned the flat stones,” Josephine said, and offered her arm not as a daughter would but as a girl in a film about trains would. They went together like that for twenty steps, a small procession of women who had not yet decided whether to be the same species. At the rail, the water had the glow of a city that had not done its homework, and the wind kept its advice to itself. Ragan took a half-step back as she’d been asked and did not remove her hand from the old habit of catching.

“Will you be the one who fixes that sign,” Ragan’s mother asked Josephine, nodding toward no sign in particular because the city is covered in instructions and apologies and owns too few ladders.

“I fix what I break,” Josephine said. “I break what needs a hole to breathe. I’m fixing signs this week. I’ve bought letters from men who don’t ask questions.”

“And the letter you lost,” her mother said, the odd grace of the old to name what the young think they’re concealing. “You give it back or you keep it.”

“I’m lining it up,” Josephine said quietly. “I’m making sure the word I give it to will be grateful.” They stood together like that until an apprentice rain tried the air and gave up and settled for a mist. They turned back toward the stairs, and between one step and the next, the thought that numbers have when they knit themselves into trouble loosened another stitch. Not a miracle. Enough.

The bathhouse grew a shelf near the door because the town asked it to. It was a plain wooden thing with the old gloss of a shop in 1978 and a handmade sign above it that said in Mrs. Frazer’s careful capitals SHOES: TAKE A PAIR IF YOU NEED, LEAVE A PAIR IF YOU CAN. People did both, sometimes on the same day, because change is not a straight line and shame is a creature with no knees. The shelf became a place to stand and say hello when you would otherwise leave after washing, because leaving requires more bravery than anyone admits in the minutes after lemon.

Letters came. A folded note from Ohio that included a photograph of a basin at a parish hall and three sentences about an argument with a pastor who had wanted to make a program out of it and how they’d compromised on tea and a notice on the cork board that read BASINS AVAILABLE, BRING YOUR OWN TOWEL. A postcard from Manila with a drawing of two sisters’ hands and two pairs of ankles with no sugar. An envelope from Lagos with a train ticket none of them could use and a scribbled recipe for buns that required more patience than money and a phone number underlined twice in case someone wanted to talk to a lemon. Ragan put the letters in a plastic sleeve as if rain were a character with desires and would be part of the story.

The council discovered the room smelled good when you cut many lemons at once and loaned a councillor who made sandwiches and did not apologize for his butter. He made the mistake of putting the kettle on with no one waiting, and the kettle declared itself and had to be poured into cups and the room changed shape as rooms do when boiling water is given something to do besides comfort. A woman came in with a pram and a face that had been doing sums and sat on the rug and cried in a way that made everyone equally expert and useless. Josephine went to her with a towel and did not touch until asked, and when the hand came out of the blanket toward hers it had that limp weight infants have and women acquire when they have carried too much and Claire—because the woman said her name without being asked—offered up both her feet and the premise that had nearly made her do something she would regret for years. Under the towel, her heels were raw because she had walked the long way to avoid a man she was trying not to bruise with the truth.

“Between Night,” Claire said, testing it for a laugh. “Between what and what.”

“Between the thing you think you owe and the thing you know,” Josephine said. “Between your feet and the ground. Between the page and the river. Between your now and your next now. We could do this all day,” she added, because a joke is a second towel.

AirInsideAir wanted very much to be the villain and could not quite pull it off, which embarrassed it as villains are rarely prepared to be embarrassed. The account started a rumor about a number six that had no details and therefore was easy to believe in. It asked for shoes to be left in specific places and then moved the places because cruelty prefers to make you walk more than once. It told a boy in a bar that he could be famous if he asked a small person to help him with a trick, and it told a girl in a kitchen that she’d only know she was brave if she hurt herself a little and let the camera turn that hurt into a handshake. It mimicked slogans with the tidy slant of someone good at lines and bad at sentences. It was local, which made it arrogant.

Mae wrote to Josephine. The page admin is from here, she wrote. Here, here, not just the county. I can’t tell you more without risking your job and my mortgage, but I will tell you this: he stays up all night and naps at dawn. He is alone near the river. He once worked in a place where he was not listened to except when he was new. He uses a photo filter that takes the red out. He is spooked by old women because they look at him like verdicts and mean it with kindness. If you see him, do not cede him your nouns.

“If you’re going to do a raid,” Declan said to Ragan over a too-quiet sandwich, “don’t call it a raid. He’ll like being raided. He’ll make merch.”

“I’m going to go on the knock,” Ragan said. “I’m going to bring Mrs. Frazer and a bucket. He’ll not expect a bucket and he’ll not know what to do with a woman who calls him love while inventing a chore he can’t refuse.”

“You’re going to make him carry water,” Declan said, and it wasn’t approval or doubt. It was the small worship you give someone who has found a tool in the dust and made it useful.

They went near dawn because Mae had said dawn was when he slept, and men who use the river like punctuation often forget we read in different directions. The stair to the quay was silver with the kind of slime that makes you careful, and the bins were cleaner because someone had made a speech in the last month that had included the word municipal and had meant it. There was a light in a window that looked like it wanted to go out and a chair near it that had the posture of someone waiting to be sat in by a specific weight. On the rail, a ribbon hung, the cheap kind with wire inside that holds a curve without deserving it, and Ragan put her finger through it until the loop resisted because the body remembers things at the oddest times and lets you play with them until memory is ready to arrive.

They found him in a shack that had once sold crisps to people on walks and now sold nothing to nobody. He had pinned photographs to the wall that made the room look like an argument had been placed inside a map. He was young with the oldness of screens. He had three pairs of shoes lined on a shelf and not one of them knew the outside. He wore a hat in a room where hats were unnecessary and valuable only as metaphors. He looked at them with the bright assessment of a man who has rehearsed for questions and has a pocket full of answers that sound like confession and aren’t.

“Did you bring a warrant,” he asked.

“We brought a bucket,” Mrs. Frazer said, because she had insisted on coming and had worn her good cardigan with the buttons that looked like cough sweets. “You’ll help us carry because you’re the only one here under sixty and I am allowed to bully the young if I carry buns. Do I know you, son.”

“You know my face,” he said. “You’ve put tea into it three times in the last decade and called me an eejit kindly when I deserved worse. You all think you own the words. You think if you take them offline they’ll stop multiplying. You’re so proud of your floor. You hate the sky. You think air belongs in kettles, not inside air.”

“You’ve been plagiarizing,” Josephine said from the doorway because she had come too, not to be hero or bait, but because she had letters in her pocket and music in her hands she didn’t trust to play without supervision. “There are only so many ways to say the things that save people. You found one and you twisted it. Go do something else. Go bake. Go sweep. Go learn to answer the phone when a woman you don’t know calls you love. You’re not frightening. You’re boring. The thing you want to be is never that.”

His face flickered then, because no one had called him boring and made it true without cruelty. He reached for a phrase about free speech and then put it back because it came out of a stall and smelled like onions. He tried to be angry at Mrs. Frazer and saw her cardigan and remembered his mother’s hand trying to teach him coin sums. He saw Declan’s tie and recognized a negotiation happening in a corner he had not been invited to. He saw the bucket and it did something primitive to his shoulders. He sat down on the chair that had been waiting and covered his face because some mornings your body petitions for mercy and your mind cannot veto it.

They did not arrest him because they could not, yet, and because they were deciding as they stood what usefulness is. They took his hard drives and his hat because it had a pin on it he would miss and would go to touch in its absence and learn something embarrassing about himself. They took the ribbon and the three pairs of shoes and a mug with a slogan on it that had not been funny even when new. They made him carry the bucket to the bathhouse and back, twice, and then they made him sit and write letters to people he had told to go to the roof, telling them instead to go to bed and to stop borrowing their lives from strangers. Mrs. Frazer read the letters over his shoulder and corrected the spelling of apology and took a bite of his sandwich because theft sometimes teaches better than fines.

When he was gone, and there was a space in the room where a man’s vanity had been, Josephine stood under the LIFELGUARD sign and took out the letter. She had planned a ceremony and then had decided not to use it. She had rehearsed a speech and then had forgotten it at the landing because the neighbor’s door smelled like stew. She licked the back of the L because glue needs truth, and pressed it under the old word so that it read like a correction written by someone brave enough to be wrong in public. LIFELGUARD looked ridiculous and correct, an instruction and an admission of defeat in the same breath. Declan laughed in the way a man who has slept badly laughs when he recognizes a joke he might have told if he were a better person.

“At some point,” he said, “we are going to have to tell someone we’ve done a thing like this and they’re going to ask for a receipt.”

“We’ll give them Mrs. Kelly,” Ragan said. “We’ll send a tray of buns with only the end pieces and they’ll know we mean it. We’ll tell them the letter cost three quid and the biscuit for the old woman cost fifty pence and the kettle cost whatever a day costs when you don’t throw it away by pretending boiling water is a thesis.”

Josephine took a photograph not for the internet but for Ragan’s mother, because she had asked, and sometimes you do what an old woman asks and you are saved later by a joke you cannot yet see. She sent it with the message L put back, and the reply came with that crisp grace her mother-in-law part of the city had perfected. It said simply, Good girl, which made Josephine cry so absurdly and thoroughly she had to take her coat off.

The next Between Night had too many people again and turned no one away. A man came with his son and did not look at his son when he said the word sorry in a register that lives near the bottom of the voice and had to be fetched up with a rope. Yinka called on speaker and told them about a woman who had made a lemon business out of her sorrow and they all applauded without irony because enterprise should shake hands with grief when it can. The Ohio woman sent a photo of a basin on a picnic blanket in a field near a Burger King, and no one judged her for the soda cups because sanctity is not scales.

On the third Thursday, they added a table with a sign that said in gentle lettering CALLOUSED HANDS, which made five men laugh and sit. A teenager came in high as a promise and left sober with a bag of rolls he had been made to carry as if they were fragile. A councillor danced like a respectable person dreams of dancing for eight seconds and then pretended it had not happened. Marie told a story about a bus she had missed and made it into a parable and then apologized for parables and made the apology into a better one.

If trouble felt insulted by how ordinary it all was, it did not retaliate immediately. It sulked in a corner at the back door and kicked the skirting and thought about other towns with fewer mops. AirInsideAir grew tired when not fed. The slope lay on the floor and played with a thread and then forgot the thread and had a nap. The graphs were not angels but they were less cruel to the men who had to draw them. The river was a river, ordinary and murderous and sentimental and indifferent, and it let two men kiss under the bridge and kept their conversation to itself.

On a Tuesday, Josephine wrote to Ragan with both hands because circumstances had demanded emphasis. I’ll take the job, she wrote, and I’ll not pretend I’m not afraid you’ll make me polite. I’ll keep the gun in the cupboard and use it on mice if they try to become saints. I’ll bring the ribbon. I’ll start Thursday if you let me pretend it’s not work for three days. I have a letter to take to the water and a girl’s mother to phone and I have to apologize to my neighbor for not knowing his dog’s name. Also, I have to buy lemons, which I resented at first and now find dear. Tell me wages and I’ll lose the right to complain about the Council’s curtains.

Ragan replied with a salutation that did not use a name and therefore committed no theft. Wages attached, she wrote, and it was a number simple enough to be real and insulting in the way good work is always insulted by budgets. You’ll not be polite, she added, unless you remember to be to Mrs. Frazer. Bring the letter. Bring the ribbon. Bring the lemon receipts. Bring your long words only if you’re willing to mop after them. Bring your bad jokes. Bring yourself between.

That night, because the city has its own taste for timing, the river lifted its shoulders in the dark and, for a minute that was long and small, looked like a page with the words rubbed off. The ants were, for once, in bed. The fox on the bench was a fox and not a parable. A boy at the quay tried to be handsome and succeeded because, briefly, he did not know anyone was watching. Somewhere in the town, the man who had wanted to be a conductor held his hands as if they had been tied and discovered he could keep them that way for a while without breaking. In her kitchen, Ragan’s mother put the letter L on the table and used it to hold down a scrap where she was writing a list for tomorrow in a big hand that would not be bullied by ink. On the bathhouse wall, the wrong sign held, and a draught from a window left badly open made it hum. It sounded like a hymn if you tilted your head. It sounded like the air inside air.Chapter 8

Morning came on like a shy confession, slow across the glass and stubborn at the edges. The bathhouse smelled of lemon and damp iron, and the door clicked against its frame as if disagreeing in a familiar marriage. Josephine arrived early with the splurge gun tucked into the cupboard between the lost badminton rackets and a coil of hose that could never remember its own circular purpose. She touched the cupboard door the way you touch a sleeping child you love and have promised not to wake. She had a broom under one arm and a ledger under the other, and the ledger made her want to be honest. The page for wages was so modest it blushed even when no one was looking, and the page for towels had columns that made her feel useful in a way that had nothing to do with beauty.

Ragan gave her keys without ceremony because ceremony can make a person feel like a guest. “You’ll regret asking for the early slot,” she said, turning the sign from CLOSED to CLOSED for a second and then to OPEN because that’s how days decide. “The old swimmers will scold you for putting the chairs a fraction wrong and then bring you sandwiches wrapped in the kind of clingfilm that loves to keep secrets.”

“They can scold me,” Josephine said, and set the broom against the wall with the posture of a violin that expects to be played. “I need elders. I can’t keep pretending I invented floors.”

The old swimmers came in with the brisk affection of women who have buried husbands and learned to flirt with walls. They adjusted two chairs as predicted and hid three buns in the cupboard where the rackets were jealous. One of them, a woman whose cap had been blue so long it had forgotten white existed, tapped the LIFELGUARD sign with her forefinger and made a vowel sound that could have been disapproval or applause depending on the year. “You going to leave it wrong,” she asked, with the exact sneer that keeps towns honest.

“I am,” Josephine said. “Until the day I need it to be right, and then I’ll make a boy on a ladder prove he knows the meaning of his vowels.”

“They don’t teach vowels any more,” the swimmer said amiably. “They teach phones. Give me a bucket. I’ll show you the vowel for clean.”

By noon, the shelf by the door had gained three pairs of shoes in sizes that meant three different lives were decided about, at least for today. A man with paint on his hands left a pair that had held his arches for a decade and walked out barefoot with the bounce of someone daring his own knees to laugh. A girl traded her glitter trainers for practical boots and whispered to Ragan that she felt like a spy and then laughed into her own jumper because she had not meant to be so pleased. Between Night had put a new habit in the room, and daytime was learning it, the way a cat learns the shape a sunspot will take on the floor around four.

A parcel arrived from far away wrapped like a festival. The label said Ibadan and the return address was written in a careful hand that meant business, not romance. Inside were dried lemon peels wrapped in newspaper and two tins of something that smelled like summer learning to read. There was a note on top that said, in Yinka’s firm print, For when the river is loud and the grocer is dear. Slice thin, forgive thick. Tell the woman with the clipboard I’ve sent my respect, which is currency here. Ragan made a face like a woman being given cash for the first time after a long winter, and Mrs. Frazer put the tins on the mantle with an authority that said they were now a family portrait.

In the afternoon, the boy with the drone arrived with his cap pulled low and the precise shame of someone who has previewed the fine print of his own future. He had a coil of rope over one shoulder and he asked if he could show the younger ones how to make a bowline because he had been taught once and it felt like an inheritance he’d nearly squandered. Marie made space at the far end of the gallery where the light was good and the echo makes laughter choose a tone. Four children learned to make loops that would hold without choking, and each of them named the loop as if that would make it faithful. The boy’s hands stopped shaking about halfway through the lesson, and he tied one knot with his eyes closed because someone asked and then opened them grinning, surprised at his own fidelity.

AirInsideAir, which had sulked after being asked to carry water, stirred once in the midweek like a spoiled cat crossing a counter. The account posted a photograph of a circle of sugar on a footbridge in another town, a bridge that did not belong to rivers the way the Peace Bridge did, and it asked for a new kind of trouble. Barefoot walk, it wrote, as if the phrase were as harmless as laundry. It promised meaning to anyone who risked glass. The local version of this challenge would have been a blooded road and a roundup of indignation. Instead, the notice board outside the church grew a second page under the Sunday readings that read SOCKS NIGHT, THURSDAY, BRING A PAIR AND TAKE TWO. A councillor’s nephew set up a table by the bus stop with a basket full of thick socks and his granny’s knitting needles for a visual threat against blisters. The fox bench gathered a drift of cotton like snow, and the children took to chalking arrows with the words THIS WAY, SHOE in letters so fat they looked like they ate well.

Josephine had promised herself to the river before she promised the room her hours, and she kept it. She went down in the evening with the letter on her palm and the splurge gun in its bag because habit is a timid animal. She stood at the rail the city had polished with worry and looked where the water did its old imitations of silk. The L sat on her hand like a tame moth. She said the name that had turned her brain into a chapel and then a ruin and then a clinic, and she didn’t add the words I’m sorry because she had finally learned what an apology is for and what it is not. She held the letter out in the air and the air held it for a second and then gave it back, undecided.

“You can toss it,” said a voice, and the voice was Ragan’s but the permission was older. “Or you can nail it to a door nobody knocks on. Or you can hold it until someone tells you to let go. I don’t have a better wisdom than that. We can make a ritual if you like, but it will still be a choice buried in the glitter.”

“She had pretty feet,” Josephine said, and the confession was indecent and pure. “They were gentle feet. I loved them because they were a part of her that said go even when the rest of her had to say stay. I made the world watch feet, and I’m not sure I didn’t do a small sacrilege with a big camera.”

“You turned a sacrament into a habit we can correct,” Ragan said. “There are worse sins. There are duller virtues. If you want to drop the L, I’ll look away for a second.”

Josephine didn’t throw it. She didn’t have that kind of theater in her. She leaned out and slid the letter into the seam between two stones where the mortar had gone to ash, a little house for a vowel. She pressed it in with the side of her thumb until the brass looked like a part of the city’s mouth. “All right,” she said to the river because the river holds secrets without effort. “You mind that for a while. I’ll come back and ask you for it when I know the word.”

The sky licked the bridge in approval and the wind did that civil thing where it respects a small speech. They turned back to the steps and found Declan sitting on the bottom one with a cardboard cup of tea and an expression that had learned to be patient so often it had grown specific muscles. He didn’t say he’d followed them. He didn’t say he worried. He handed the tea up and said there’d been a phone call from a mother who had shut off the electric to keep her daughter from charging her phone at night and had found out there are candles and there is light and there’s a bad kind of both.

“Bring her Thursday,” Josephine said, because sometimes answers are only logistics. “Bring her Thursday and we’ll light the room with kettles.”

That week the bathhouse learned what it is to be a refuge when electricity gets moody. A wind from Donegal dragged a purse of weather over the roofs and emptied it extravagantly. The lights failed on a hundred small lives at once, and people came the old way, by feet, into the building that had inherited the job of being civic. The emergency lights pretended to be brave and then gave up, and candles were a cliché they were not allowed to indulge. They made heat of bodies and the hum of conversation. The LIFELGUARD sign hummed like a sleepy fridge because it was wired wrong in a way that kept it truthful.

Someone found the old paraffin heater and someone else the paraffin, and a third someone who had read the wrong manual tried to light it with a sigh until Mrs. Frazer swatted his hand gently and took the match. They put the heater on a tile and made a ring around it like a stern sentence. The ants found the warmth and came up in a small parade, sleepy and offended. Josephine guided them with a line of biscuit crumbs toward a gap in the skirting she had discovered with her ear, and the children watched as if seeing a fable composed for them personally. The splurge gun came out of its cupboard only to seal a weeping seam near the back window where the rain had decided it was a negotiator. Sugar made a temporary gasket, and later Josephine would mop it to water and apologize to the mice for confusing their maps.

In the half-light, stories grew exaggerated and then decorous, as they do when you cannot see each other’s eyes well enough to risk too much truth. Mrs. Frazer told about a night in 1974 when the lights had gone but the kettle had not and her husband had proposed a second time because he’d forgotten he already had with a fish knife in his hand and she’d said yes again to keep him from embarrassment and because a second yes never hurt anyone. Marie confessed that she’d learned to swim in a quarry because her father had lied about the depth and then taught her by accident, which made two old men both insulted and proud. Declan put his feet into a basin because he had nowhere else to put them and the room wanted to see what his ankles looked like, and he blushed in a way that convinced three teenagers he was not purely a uniform after all.

A reporter from a paper with a name that carried too many consonants came to watch and found himself carrying cups because he had arrived late and ignored a sign that said take a mop. He asked twice for a quote and got directions to the lemon slices. He wrote anyway in his notebook with a pen that had a miniature of his own brand on it, and his copy later was decent because he could not pretend he had not felt someone pass him a basin without asking his name.

Elle’s mother came, not because she had forgiven, and not because she had found a new grammar for her loss, but because she had run out of ways to refuse a kindness that did not look at her face and try to guess the future. She came with a coat too thin and a hair clip that had belonged to a nurse and the particular posture of a person who chooses a chair with her back to a wall. Josephine went toward her with a towel and then stopped six feet away and waited. The room, which had learned a new stealth, did not make a sound that drew attention toward the corner where two people were considering a fragile architecture.

“Don’t say her name if it hurts your teeth,” Elle’s mother said at last, and it was a generosity and a trap and a way to tell if the person before her was worth more time.

“It hurts,” Josephine said. “My mouth remembers it and then remembers why it stopped. I keep a vowel in a hole in a rock and I’m waiting for the day I can use it on a word that will take it.”

“She liked a river she had never seen,” the mother said. “She said the word Derry like she was naming a friend I had not met yet. I have been cross at this town for being in her mouth.” She sat heavily, which is the opposite of poise and better. “You made the world look at the part of her that went first. I hated you, and I put the kettle on, and I hated you softer, and I put the kettle on again, and I wrote my priest, and then I put the kettle on and forgot to drink.” She looked down at her own feet as if they had lied to her. “I want to be jealous of her toes, which is nonsensical and wicked.”

“Wicked and nonsensical are the only honest things I’ve said out loud in months,” Josephine said. “If you hate me tonight, I’ll take it. If you let me wash your feet, I’ll take that too. If you want to tell me lies about her so you can hear what it sounds like to say she never got sick, I’ll listen to fairy tales in the voice that suits you.”

The basin held both their hands at once for a second because one of them needed to catch the lemon and the other needed to know the water was warm. They found a small rhythm of washing that felt like praying and wasn’t. The room widened to accommodate the two of them and then politely forgot them. The ants took a different exit because their preacher had spoken.

On Friday, the council sent a woman with an enthusiasm that had not yet been broken by a budget. She sat on the sandboxed benches with a laptop balanced on knees that did not approve and tried to count faces and call it data. She asked if they could franchise Between Night, and Ragan made a sound that could have been a sneeze and could have been despair and then said they could mail lemons and instructions but people would still have to boil their own water. Josephine said she would happily write an instruction manual titled How Not To Make It Content and then accused herself of hypocrisy aloud before anyone else could and they all laughed because they had permitted themselves the joke.

A day came without drama because life respects a schedule when you’ve earned it, and the bathhouse leaned into its usefulness with the relief of an old frame given a new painting. The fox on the bench lost another freckle of paint and regained it within the hour because a child brought a brush from her mother’s bag with the confidence of the deputized. The drone boy, who had a name and was learning to use it in public, taught a grandmother to tie a loop and was taught to bake a bun that didn’t collapse, and they both pretended to have learned nothing because pride would have envied them too hard.

The ugly page tried once more. AirInsideAir sent an invitation to a thing it called a pilgrimage of arches, a walk in bare feet across a series of thresholds that ended at a door with a white gate that belonged to a bathhouse everyone knew. The post lingered for seven minutes with a small savage intensity and then vanished because Mae had taught two juniors to recognize poetry used as a weapon and they struck with the nicety of surgeons. The followers complained and then wrote to each other about soup. The admin of the ugly account wrote to Mae calling her a censor and she wrote back calling herself a janitor and added a proverb about mops he did not understand and then she clocked off and made her own lemon tea and found herself crying in a way she had not allowed since July.

The night of the lanterns was nobody’s idea until a child made it. He brought a jar with holes in the lid and a string and a light too small to be a candle, and he walked around the room until someone asked his name and he said One, which was not the truth but was a convenient poem for the evening. Ten jars became twenty because people like a count when nobody dies if it grows. They put paper around the jars with letters drawn on them in blunt marker, and when they lined them on the rail the word did not make itself until the last jar was placed and even then it was more suggestion than command. It read STAY, and it read STAY with an invitation rather than an order, and it is possible that the river, which is an old animal and does not cry, felt something like a hand on its bony head and chose to behave.

Josephine walked home that night with empty hands because she had left her tools in the cupboard like a person learning faith. The city had that post-storm glitter of pavements that have forgiven their own hardness. She found the neighbor in the hall with his coin-faced dog and said the dog’s name at last. It was Bingo, which made both of them look embarrassed and then relieved because you cannot pretend sophistication around a dog called Bingo. She told him she might be late with the rent if the wages arrived asleep and he said he had once worked for a council and he would boil a kettle and help her write a letter that read as if it were fed and clothed and therefore worth reading. They stood in the hall a minute longer than two people in an Irish hallway should and then they both remembered they were not in a film and went into their flats like decent cowards.

The ants returned to the skirting at dawn as if nothing had happened because that is how absolution appears: in repetition. The fox wore its ribbon as if it had married a secret. The L in the stone by the river kept its shine under the wet as if brass liked being baptized without a priest. The boy who had nearly made a show of a roof found himself telling a younger boy how to use a knot to anchor a tent and then caught himself and blushed and did not pretend he had meant to turn useful. Declan took his graph to the bin and then took it out again because graphs do not deserve despair or litter; he used the back for a shopping list and wrote lemons in large letters and bread in larger and added the word soap at the last because rooms that hold sorrow need to smell like work.

Somewhere in a place with snow not rain, a girl watched a video of a basin and made a paper boat and floated it across the kitchen sink to her mother, who pretended to be surprised. Somewhere the man who had tried to be conductor sat at a desk and did nothing for an hour because doing nothing is a practice you can improve at until it is almost art. Somewhere a councillor with butter on his cuff found that he had become a man who looked forward to Thursdays. Somewhere in the past, a woman pressed an L onto a wristband that would later make a city speak a language it didn’t know it owned.

And in the bathhouse, the sign hummed, and the letters didn’t rearrange themselves because people had hands to do that if they wanted, and they did not yet want. They kept the wrongness where it was because it held a comma the town needed. It was a pause between two good ideas. It was a place for breath within breath. It was a little door in the middle of a bigger one, marked with a letter that had been lost and then found, not in a rush of repentance, but in the slow certainty of work.Chapter 9

The inspector came smelling of photocopier toner and rain, with a fluorescent vest that suggested he had dressed for drama and would settle for form. He stood in the doorway of the bathhouse and consulted a checklist so long it looked like a story no one would choose to read, and he had the voice of a man who respects kettles but fears liability. Ragan walked him through the rooms with her shoulders open and her palms clean, pointing out the rails that were painted wrong on purpose and the towels hung like a procession. He paused under the LIFELGUARD sign and frowned as if letters could trip a person in court, and she told him the wrongness was a reminder to step carefully, which was both true and not useful to a man with a badge that said Safety in block capital letters. When he asked about candles, she pointed to a shelf of jars with lights inside too shy to be flames and said they didn’t trust ghosts with matches. He nodded once like a man offered tea would nod before declining and made a note about “alternative illumination” that looked like a compliment if you tilted your head. By the time he reached the cupboard where the splurge gun slept, he had softened into the version of himself that remembered playing badminton in a hall that also smelled of lemon, and he asked if the mop handles had been sanded to avoid splinters with the seriousness of a surgeon checking a suture. Ragan showed him a callus on her palm and he made a sound that might have been affection and might have been bureaucracy purring.

Josephine watched the exchange with the composure of a woman who had filed too many tickets and now preferred to fix what she could touch. She had the ledger open on the counter and the new page marked STAFF in a handwriting that wanted to be neat and had accepted it would never be small. When the inspector asked if they had a documented evacuation plan, she slid a sheet across the table that was both irreverent and impeccable, with arrows that knew the habits of panic and words that had been chosen to respect an old fear of crowds. He read it, flicked his eyes to the room, and then read it again, and his pen hesitated over the page as if surprised by the pleasure of approving something that felt like sense. He stamped a stamp on a form that stamped nothing in a mind and wrote “conditional” with a flourish that suggested he’d given something away and wanted to believe he could take it back, and when he left he put a hand on the doorframe the way men do when they want to feel they have contributed to a structure’s endurance.

By afternoon, the old swimmers had already made small changes no form could capture. They tied ribbons to the mop handles so you could find them in a hurry without making a noise like an alarm, and they added a second tea towel to the hook near the sink because one is never enough when grief is present and insists on drying its hands twice. The boy who used to fly a drone brought a box of plastic clips and attached them to the chair backs so the LED jars could hang at a height that made faces look like faces and not like stories waiting to happen. He had begun to answer to his name when people said it without the upward tilt of a question, and it gave him a new kind of shyness he treated with the seriousness of a man being taught to tie a tie by a neighbor.

Mae’s kettle fund arrived by quiet routes. She sent a message to Josephine that included only a receipt for twelve electric kettles bought from a shop whose owner kept his opinions about the internet in a drawer and a note that said the boxes would be marked “school supplies.” The delivery man looked relieved to be carrying boxes that claimed to be stationary when they were so clearly hope with plugs, and he stacked them by the office door while Declan filled in a form about donations in the hand he used for maps. No one made a speech when they were unboxed; they put two on and two to rest and kept the rest in the cupboard where the old rackets had stopped sulking because they had recognized a younger tool coming to take their place on the wall where useful things hang.

Grant people are different from inspectors and they announce their difference with scented paper and adjectives. A woman from the council’s arts fund whose hair argued against the weather brought a form that asked what outcomes they expected to deliver and whether those outcomes could be measured without harming the fragile private thing that made the nights work. The analyst, who had learned to make graphs look like furniture rather than ladders, sat with her at a table by the deep end and told stories that had numbers at their edges and breathing in their middle. He drew a rectangle that stood for a week and inside it he put squares for basins, circles for lemons, stars for buns, and a thick line where the angry slope had decided to become a bench and rest. She blinked twice in the way people do when their training sets collide with rooms that smell like rind, and she wrote on her clipboard the phrase “qualitative saturation” as if she meant to water it and come back later to see if it had sprouted chairs. Josephine, who was sweeping near enough to overhear, offered the phrase “bread per capita” and everyone laughed except the ants, who were busy finding the crack that kept their governance intact.

Work found another kind of trouble to dress itself in, the kind spelled with insurance and stamped with reminders. A letter arrived about public liability that carried the scent of men who had discovered risk by reading about it. The underwriter wanted to know if anyone had slipped on sugar in the last thirty days and whether the jars were flameproof and why there had been a child seen leaving with boots not their own in a photo someone had taken against the rules. Ragan wrote back in the tone she used when a priest was asking nosy questions and told the story of towels that had prevented a fall, jars that warmed without pretending to be fire, and a shelf that had given a girl a plan more valuable than any pair of shoes. She attached a photograph of the sign that read TAKE A PAIR IF YOU NEED, LEAVE A PAIR IF YOU CAN and dared the letter to be unmoved by capitals and commonsense in the same line. When no reply came for forty-eight hours, she went to the office, made tea, and took the reply from the printer tray herself after the clerk confessed he had stuck it under the blotter to stop it making him angry at his own job. The final line read continue with caution, which sounded like a household blessing, and they framed it and hung it in the office as if it had come from someone who loved them.

On a Wednesday, Ragan’s mother forgot the sequence of her cupboard and put the sugar in the fridge and the milk on the table and her mind began to make the sound a drawer makes when pushed too quickly against stops. Ragan brought her to the bathhouse in the afternoon with the intention of letting the sound soften in a place that did not require names, and the old swimmers arranged a chair for the woman as if they were positioning a queen whose crown was a hair clip. Josephine took a cloth to her hands with the gentleness she saved for things that might break and discovered a story about a lemon press from 1972 and a man who had insisted on pouring tea like a ceremony despite a war thinking it owned the room. The younger women watched the older women’s mouths and kept quiet because there are schools that exist without chalk.

The wrongness of the sign became a local idiom. Children said lifelguard when they meant someone had caught them in a small disaster they’d made for themselves and grown-ups used it as a verb for the act of standing in a doorway to keep weather from coming in while others looked for buckets. A bus driver came in on his break and asked if he could sit under the letters for a minute and listen to the hum because his day had been a collection of horns and a hum sometimes can unknit horn enough to make sleep happen later. A poet nobody recognized as such brought a notebook and wrote down every variation of the word between uttered by people who did not mean to be lyrical, and he left a copy on the shelf next to the shoes under a roll of tape as if it were a spare.

AirInsideAir flickered like a faulty bulb and then swung once more toward spectacle. It posted a schedule for something it called “arches of memory,” an attempt at pilgrimage that would have led a small crowd over thresholds they did not own toward the white gate that everyone now understood was a person pretending not to be tired. Mae saw it and sent a screenshot with a line of expletives that would have made her grandmother proud, and the juniors she’d trained put their small hands on big switches and took the post down as if removing an old splinter from a town’s palm. She wrote to Josephine that the account had resorted to sending direct messages that were both manipulative and shy, and that she was compiling a list of neighbors to warn without warning them into fear. Josephine wrote back that she could make a kettle whistle meaner than any DM and that if Mae ever wanted to sit in the bathhouse and not listen to the internet scold itself, they would find her a chair with a line of ants that always ends and a cup they keep only for women who save rooms.

Declan took a day to visit three men he called by their surnames when he needed them and by their nicknames when they were the ones who might carry water. He asked them to stand at the edges of Thursdays not to eject anyone but to catch the person who arrived with a knife and a feeling, and he bribed them with that particular police coffee that tastes like sorrow and cigarettes cured in a jar. On the way back he stopped at the beech and touched the nail as if he had been given the ritual by a mother rather than a job, and he found the ribbon Josephine had left faded to a color that felt like a secret you no longer had to keep. He posted nothing about it because not everything is a parable that needs witnesses.

The day of the storm came and brought with it a leak that tried to turn a corner of the gallery into a waterfall and found itself confused by sugar. Josephine climbed a ladder that had not been asked to be heroic in years and used the splurge gun like a stubborn needle, stitching up a seam in the roof with lines that hardened under her breath. Ragan stayed at the foot of the ladder with her hands on the rails and her eyes on Josephine’s feet, and the old swimmers formed a ring around them with towels as if catching were a discipline one had to see performed to believe in. When the leak turned into a weep, someone started clapping and was told off gently because indulgence is a gateway drug to complacency, and they put basins under what was left of the small ambition of rain. That night the paraffin heater hummed like a contented fridge and a child fell asleep on a bench with a towel for a pillow while her mother had a conversation with a woman she had met only at a bus stop five years earlier when both of them were wearing coats they no longer owned.

From Ohio came a longer letter than the ones before, written in ink that had had too much coffee. The writer confessed to having tried to organize a Between Night in the parish hall and having discovered that Americans put words on things too quickly when fear is near. She wrote that the sign-up sheet had frightened people more than the water had comforted and that the janitor had taught her more in one minute about making rooms safe than the priest had in an hour about grace. She wrote that they had compromised on no photographs and on the bishop bringing oranges without being asked to pray over them, and she enclosed a photograph of three basins on a basketball court that had taped lines like a map of arguments no longer relevant. Ragan read it aloud and then tore it in half and then taped it back together because that seemed like the right grammar for an apology accepted and a habit learned the hard way.

Yinka sent a voice message with the sound of the market under it and did not apologize for the noise because joy is always noisy, and he told the story of a woman who had made lemon peels into sweets and sold them next to a bucket with a sign that said in bold, wicked letters DO NOT TAKE WATER UNLESS YOU WILL USE IT. He laughed at his own accent in the English word unless and it made the room in Derry laugh too, because laughter is a river that sometimes leaps continents without needing a bridge. He asked after the fox, which had, thanks to a child with a steady hand, gained a second ribbon, and Josephine told him the fox was now a bureaucrat and a poet and wore its ribbon like a lanyard.

A letter arrived with an official crest from a department that always calls itself by its initials as if embarrassed by the words they stand for, and it announced that the bathhouse had been selected for a pilot program on community resilience. Ragan read it and felt her bones attempt to roll their eyes, and she took the letter to her mother, who put it under the table leg that wobbled slightly because it had done so since 1986. Josephine wrote to Mae to ask how to say no to a pilot without becoming a cautionary tale in a report, and Mae wrote back that sometimes the only way to refuse content is to do the work so publicly people lose interest in watching and to set the meetings for hours of the day the internet spends asleep. They agreed to send numbers but not narratives and to invoice for kettles rather than for miracles.

The night when Elle’s mother came for the second time, she asked for no basin and no lemon and chose instead a chair near the LIFELGUARD sign. She listened to the hum as if measuring whether it had kept its pitch, and she told Josephine the story of the day her daughter had learned left and right and had got them wrong for a year and a half and then not wrong ever again. Josephine said that she continually confused north with down and had decided to love the error instead of cure it, and they both looked at the floor and agreed it was where the truth lives whether you want it or not. They did not use the girl’s name because they were hunting a different animal tonight and it obliged them by not showing itself and they let themselves be grateful for the respite.

Outside, a man no one had remembered to suspect tried to lay sugar in a neat oval at the park bench where the fox presided and discovered that the city had learned to steal implements from any ritual that tried to hurt it. A child of eleven, deputized by boredom rather than law, walked over and asked him what he thought he was doing and then told him they didn’t do that anymore with the authority of a mayor. He looked at his hands and then at the oval that had failed to become significant and wiped it with his sleeve because there are worse shames than being told off by a small person dressed like Tuesday. He went home and packed a bag to go to his sister’s where she would put him on the sofa and feed him stew and let him be a man who had made a mistake in public and been rescued by a girl with ribbon in her hair.

There were still injuries because life continues to be life even when you add lemons. A boy sprained his ankle jumping a wall he had jumped a hundred times without incident and swore it was a curse until Mrs. Frazer told him it was his growth spurt and gave him a lecture about bones that had been refined over three sons and a nephew. A woman cut her finger on a jar because she had twisted the lid with grief in her wrist and Marie sat her on a chair with her hand in a bowl of cold water and told her about clumsy days as if confessing to a priest who had a mop. The paraffin heater finally died with a little smoke and a sound like it had had enough, and the room stood in its absence and felt gratitude for what had warmed them and irritation at having to go find another way.

The council, emboldened by the lack of catastrophe, suggested a public celebration of Between Night and proposed a daytime event with speeches and a ribbon cutting and perhaps a small plaque. Ragan said they could plant a tree instead because trees make their own speeches in years nobody attends, and the councillor with butter on his cuff said he had a cousin who could find them a sapling that had been neglected and would like to be taken seriously. The tree, when it arrived, looked like a stick with an ambition and the old swimmers stood around it and judged whether it would thrive, and one of them swore she could hear it rooting for the first time like a baby finding its breath. They planted it near the fox so it could learn what it means to be stared at and survive.

In the ledger, Josephine wrote in a new hand that looked like a woman forgiving herself for beauty, and the line read Wages paid, and under it she put her own name and the number, and then she wrote another line that was nothing to do with money and everything to do with account, and it read Elle’s mother sat, water unused, hum appreciated. She turned the page and made a list for Thursday that had two categories, Things We Can Plan and Things That Will Insist, and under the second she wrote weather, sorrow, and men who think lakes are caps you can wear, and then under the first she wrote tea, chairs, rope, lemons, mops, and names.

The river introduced fog for a morning and everyone forgave it because fog makes edges kind. The Peace Bridge went from being an instruction to a suggestion, and people walked across it slower, which made strangers look like acquaintances. The L in the stone took on a coat of moss so fine it looked like it had been given a shawl, and Josephine touched it gently and decided to let algae do its work because it is good sometimes to let letters grow older without moving them. The ants held a meeting near the skirting that looked like rehearsal and then changed their minds and went back to carrying sweetness like the innate liturgy it is, and a child watched them and reported to his father that ants do meetings wrong because they never have biscuits at the end.

At dusk, while the room did its evening breathing and the kettles made reassurance rhythmic, Ragan stood at the door and watched the corridor that leads from town to river and thought of all the corridors she had learned in buildings that smelled like sweat and courts and bread. She thought of her father and his coat and her own badge in a desk and of the letter her mother had used to prop a table and of how much administrative paper had been domesticated by women who needed an even table to butter bread on. Josephine came to stand beside her with a cloth over her shoulder like a waitress in a family that couldn’t afford to eat out, and they watched one more jar come in with a light inside it, and then another, until the rail looked like someone had placed a line of excuses for staying along it. Declan appeared in the reflection like a sentence that knows where to stop and said he had taken his angry triangle and drawn a circle over it, and the analyst had given it a name that made him want to retire his felt pens for a day. Ragan nodded without turning and said a circle is still a journey and Josephine said a circle is the best room when the floor keeps us honest, and they stayed a minute longer than necessary because sometimes staying is the only virtue anyone asks of you and sometimes it is the best you will do.

Later, when the jars were put to sleep and the towels sighed on their rails and the ledger lay closed with the satisfaction of a day tended, Josephine walked home by the long way, past the bench and the beech and the nail, past the shop with the doorbell that rang like a laugh, past the stair where the shoes had gone inside at last and made the hall smell like responsibility. She thought of beginning again being just another way to describe doing the next thing, and she thought of a sentence she might write down and then did not because not everything was safer as writing. At the landing, her neighbor’s door opened and Bingo’s coin face appeared and there is no metaphor that survives the soft weight of a dog leaning into your shin. She knelt and let her hands forget being useful and learn only touching, and in a room next to hers the L hummed in a stone by the river and approved without claiming authority.
