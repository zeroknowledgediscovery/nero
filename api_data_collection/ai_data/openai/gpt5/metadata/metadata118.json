     "novel_text": "The day the gulls lined the rail like judges, the sky over Elliott Bay hung low and textured, a ceiling of gray wool threaded with hints of blue. Seattle has moods. On that morning it was taking deep breaths and thinking of rain. Marin Gray watched the ferry lumber across the water, watched its white hull carve a wake that folded in on itself, watched her reflection stall in the glass of the market window then flicker back into a stranger\u2019s.\n\nHer father always said the city had a pulse you could find if you put your hand to the right pipe. In their old house\u2014before the house itself slipped into that other, adjacent country where the Tidelands begin\u2014Marin would lay her ear to the basement wall and listen to the faint thrum of water under concrete. She could still find it, the beat and counter-beat, when she stood at the edge of the pier and breathed with the sound. Did people notice, the little tilt of the tide when she whispered? Sometimes she thought the bay leaned closer to hear her.\n\nShe adjusted her scarf, a blue so deep it might have been dipped in twilight, and headed past the fishmongers. They were throwing salmon at each other simply because they could, performing for the visitors and for themselves. The air was sharp with iced fish, espresso, flowers two days into wilting. A tourist squealed when a fish turned midair like a silver switchblade. Marin smiled and let the sound pass through her, a tide itself.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late, princess,\u201d Ezra said when she reached the bookstore.\n\nHe always said princess in the way Seattle says things it half-believes: a joke with a long shadow. Ezra had hair that couldn\u2019t decide which direction to go and a chin a sculptor might have argued with. He tossed her the ring of keys. \u201cWe\u2019ve already had three requests for that out-of-print tide guide, can you imagine. People feel very spiritual about schedules.\u201d\n\n\u201cSchedules are their only religion,\u201d she said, and unlocked the door.\n\nThey worked in a room that smelled like paper and dust and the secondhand ink of other people's notes. The bookstore, which insisted on calling itself Perigee & Apogee as if the moon had cut a ribbon at its opening, creaked when anyone walked too assertively. Bookcases leaned. A cat named Sel fed herself on the fish smell drifting up the hill when demonstrations bored her.\n\nMarin loved it. Loved the way used books carried the warm, humid memory of someone else\u2019s summer. Loved the way Ezra could recite entire paragraphs from flawed memoirs with a straight face. Loved stepping outside to take the trash down on the slick boards behind the shop and feeling the water\u2019s nearness, like a cousin showing up uninvited.\n\n\u201cWant a coffee?\u201d Ezra asked midmorning, peering at her over a stack of travelogues. \u201cYou\u2019re doing that thing with your fingers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cCounting, like an itinerant mathematician. Coffee?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\n\nShe counted without meaning to when the barometer inside her shifted. One, two, three. A gull heart-beating. Four, five. The ferry docking. On six a vein of cold ran down the back of her neck and made her teeth ache. Rain was thinking about falling. She felt it the way a fisherman feels a bite before the line goes taut.\n\nEzra came back with the coffee he only pretended to mess up. He slid it over the counter with a flourish, then leaned in. \u201cSo. What\u2019s new in the palace?\u201d\n\nShe laughed. \u201cOh you know. From the porch of our two-bedroom palace with the rattling windows, I extend clemency to the pigeon that refuses to leave the fire escape and command it to poop only on the neighbor\u2019s side.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour rule is merciful and wise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about you? How\u2019s your campaign to not text your ex after midnight?\u201d\n\n\u201cViciously effective. I only thought about it. Twice.\u201d\n\nThey bantered. The hours leaned into one another. People came in to ask for old maps and novels about ageless things. Noon melted into afternoon. At some point a foghorn bellowed from the bay, low and insistently mournful. A tug\u2019s voice. A foghorn is a throat with steel in it but Marin had sometimes thought she could hear words if she stood at the right angle. She looked up. The windows trembled like water.\n\nThe bell over the door rang at two. It rang and then didn\u2019t, because someone had stepped inside without making it ring. That happens sometimes when wind sneaks in with a guest, but the air didn\u2019t move. Marin felt it, a notch of absence, the precise subtraction of sound and smell. Even Sel sat up as if something had rearranged the furniture inside the world.\n\nThe woman who stood by the travelogues had rain on her coat that didn\u2019t look like rain. Not Seattle rain, not the casual spatter of a shower that barely bothers your hair. This rain was thin and metallic, like a condensate scraped off an antique clock, silver on her sleeve and beaded on her hood. She took the hood down. Black hair, blunt. Skin the color of the underside of a cloud at dawn. Eyes that made the light hesitate.\n\nEzra opened his mouth to say hello. She lifted a hand and the hello fell out of him onto the floor and broke.\n\n\u201cMarin Gray,\u201d she said, and there was an accent in the way she slipped around the syllables. Old. Slightly salt. \u201cYour Highness.\u201d\n\nEzra\u2019s eyes went from Marin to the woman and back again, a cat\u2019s eyes following the idea of a laser pointer.\n\n\u201cNot here,\u201d Marin said. Her voice came out softer than she intended.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the woman said. \u201cHere. Because here is where you insist on living. You were told to keep moving and yet. You planted your feet in a city built on water and pretend you can\u2019t be found when anyone with a map and a nose could trace your steps. The coffee, the bay, the bridges. All your favorite things smell like you.\u201d\n\nSel hissed at her and then pretended she had not.\n\nMarin did not look at Ezra. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cCourier.\u201d The woman fished in the inside pocket of her coat and brought out an envelope that was not an envelope until she set it on the counter. On the way down it was a smear of light, then a folded thing that might have been paper once and was now paper again. A seal held it closed, stamped with a spiral coil that made Marin\u2019s stomach twist. \u201cFrom the Concord.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m busy,\u201d Marin said without moving her hands from the counter. \u201cWe\u2019re reorganizing the geography section, as you can see.\u201d\n\nEzra found his voice. \u201cMarin, do you\u2014should I give you two some privacy? Or should I\u2014what is this? Who\u2014are you dangerous?\u201d He said the last word like it might be a flavor.\n\nThe courier took in the shop, the leaning bookcase with its listing titles, the stacks of magazines about boats that wanted to be boats more than read about them. \u201cTell your friend to take his break.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take my break,\u201d Ezra said automatically, and he was gone through the curtain into the little kitchen where Sel never went because the linoleum unnerved her. Silence in the front of the shop like a pressure change ahead of a storm.\n\nMarin looked at the envelope. It smelled faintly of rosemary and wet iron. And something else. Something like the place where a stream runs under a slaughterhouse. She swallowed.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have found me,\u201d she said, and it sounded petulant, which she hated. \u201cI wasn\u2019t\u2014do they send couriers now? What happens to messengers who step onto this side with seals in their pockets?\u201d\n\nThe courier smiled without showing teeth. \u201cThey go home if they go quickly. They stay if they dawdle. I do not dawdle.\u201d\n\nMarin wiped her hands on her jeans. Her fingers were colder than the counter. \u201cWho sent it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Concord.\u201d The woman tipped her chin at the seal. \u201cOpen it. It\u2019s for you. It asked to be warmed by your hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know how it works.\u201d Marin picked it up. It made a sound like a sigh and something else; like the rustle of cedar boughs in a dream you wouldn\u2019t admit to having. She ran a thumb along the seal, which parted. Inside: thick paper that held the memory of the tree it had been. Ink that had dried in stages, as if the message had been written by several hands all at once.\n\nLittle places you can\u2019t avoid. She had missed them and not missed them at all.\n\nHighness, the first line said, and then her name spelled as it is not ever spelled on driver\u2019s licenses or prescriptions. What came after was like stepping on a stone you believed steady and finding it turn under your foot. The letter mentioned the Confluence in autumn and the words \u201cnecessary\u201d and \u201conly.\u201d It mentioned an event of a nature both predictable and entirely new. It mentioned thresholds, coupons of luck unused and now expired, tides that had reversed their instructions. It mentioned the smell.\n\nYou will have noticed the smell, it said, almost sympathetic.\n\nShe had. Over the last month the city had acquired a second scent at dawn. It was not the warm, sour dough of bread or the freeway\u2019s hot breath or the early morning romance of jet fuel. It was not the sharp green of the market stalls or the sweet rot that rose from the compost bins when someone forgot the lid. This new smell slid in under all of that and laced it together with a stitch you couldn\u2019t quite see.\n\nThe smell of something left in the sun too long and then taken inside and pretended normal. The smell of damp carpet in a house that has been shut up for years. Or of seaweed dragged too far upshore and left to curl. It made waiters frown and wave their hands under their noses and ask strangers if they could smell gas. It made Marin wake up at three a.m. with the taste of metal coins in her mouth.\n\nThe letter did not write the name the smell belonged to, but it didn\u2019t have to. Marin had been a girl in halls that hummed when you said that name. Old books had been wrapped in waxed cloth so that the mere mention of it would not be soaked up by their spines and carried forward to frighten another reader. Don\u2019t say it, her father said. Don\u2019t write it, your ink will turn back and spit the word in your face.\n\nThe courier watched her read to the end. Marin kept her face still. She folded the letter. It unfolded itself. She folded it again harder. It sighed and lay down like a cat who has decided not to get up after all.\n\n\u201cWhat do they want.\u201d Not even a question. An accusation.\n\n\u201cYou.\u201d The courier\u2019s smile went away. \u201cThere is a matter with the Concord that concerns the better part of four realms. The one you claim and the one that shares its shoreline with this city, the one under that, and the one that touches all the above through mirrors and windows. There will be a meeting. You\u2019ll receive instructions. And then you will do as you are asked because you were named and the naming was witnessed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pretend,\u201d the courier said, and for a moment the word lost its modern coat. It was the older pretend: to make-present, to bring into the room. \u201cDo not pretend you do not know what your father was. Do not pretend you didn\u2019t swear by the shell and the salt. Do not pretend this city isn\u2019t your bolt-hole and your refuge and your leash. The Concord does not ask lightly. We have other options when we wish to be rude.\u201d\n\nMarin felt small and old. She felt like someone else\u2019s daughter. The shop around them creaked, heat rising in the pipes. The ferry let out another low call that sent the hair on her arms up. Was the water closer now than the street said it should be? She could never tell.\n\n\u201cWhat if I refuse?\u201d\n\nThe courier\u2019s eyebrows made the smallest movement. \u201cWhy ask questions you have already answered.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet you have.\u201d\n\nEzra appeared at the curtain, hand frozen in the act of pushing it aside. He looked at the courier and then at Marin and then at the letter that had once been not-paper and would be not-paper again if it went where it wanted. \u201cHey. So. Are we okay? Is this about taxes?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about tides,\u201d Marin said without looking at him. \u201cIt\u2019s about invitations I didn\u2019t ask for.\u201d\n\nThe courier had already turned toward the door. She didn\u2019t touch it. The door opened, obedient. She paused with her hand on the air, like someone might pause on a bannister.\n\n\u201cYou will feel the instructions as much as receive them,\u201d she said, not quite to Marin, not quite to the threshold. \u201cYou will understand them not long after you stop wishing you didn\u2019t. Prepare your friend to be left.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not leaving,\u201d Marin said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll leave,\u201d the woman said.\n\n\u201cAnd you? Do you leave?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways. Before it starts to smell.\u201d\n\nThe door closed. The bell rang, belated. The air added itself back to the room in increments, like someone reopening a fist. Ezra took a breath so sharp Sel glanced up and glared at him for disturbing her nap.\n\n\u201cYou. Are. The. Actual. Princess.\u201d Ezra said it slowly, as if he\u2019d decided to become the punctuation he needed. \u201cYou are the princess of\u2014of\u2014what? The Seattle Aquarium?\u201d\n\nMarin closed her eyes. When she opened them the letter still lay on the counter, impossible not to see. She reached out and slid it back into the envelope that went heavier in her hand the way a stone does when it decides it\u2019s tired of being thrown. The wax seal had remade itself. It made a soft chuff when she ran her thumb across it, like a seal. She almost laughed at that and then did not.\n\n\u201cOf a place that touches this place,\u201d she said. \u201cOf the water that holds this city like a hand around a bowl. It\u2019s complicated and also not. And you promised once never to ask me to explain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that promise was about this.\u201d Ezra came around the counter the way you approach a cat on the sidewalk: not too fast. \u201cWho was she? The woman. Don\u2019t say courier, that\u2019s not a name.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople like that don\u2019t give names. It tangles them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said people. Is she\u2014like you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWorse,\u201d Marin said, which wasn\u2019t an answer.\n\nThey closed the shop early because Ezra refused not to stand with her even if he did not know where she needed standing. They walked down to the edge of the pier and leaned against the metal railing that had been painted and repainted so many times it had its own topography. The water was a pane of sleeping stone. A squirrel said something profane to a child. A man in a high-vis jacket checked the bolts on something with the reverence of a priest.\n\nMarin didn\u2019t open the envelope because she knew what it would do. She cupped her coffee in both hands and watched the white ferry pass and the black gulls turn into commas against the sky and then back into birds.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you because it sounds like lying,\u201d she said eventually. \u201cSaying \u2018I\u2019m a princess\u2019 here is like saying you\u2019re a wizard or a tax break. Ridiculous by default. And it doesn\u2019t help. It doesn\u2019t give you health insurance. It doesn\u2019t make landlords nicer.\u201d\n\nEzra\u2019s voice was careful. \u201cSo you are one. For real real.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor real real.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you left. Or you were\u2014what? Exiled? Do we say exiled? That sounds very cloak-and-dagger.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of that. Just. I didn\u2019t like the way the rooms made my lungs feel. I didn\u2019t like the way people said my name like it was something you could take a bite out of. I wanted to hear traffic. I wanted to be anonymous and watch the clouds throw themselves at the city and dissolve.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they let you go.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t prisoners.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why does it feel like she came to arrest you?\u201d\n\nMarin didn\u2019t have a neat answer and so did not try to make one. She reached up and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and the wind put it back in her face. The air across the bay shifted. You could taste the change on your tongue if you had that kind of mouth. She did. It tasted like\u2014she frowned. Like something trying very hard to masquerade as something else. Like\u2014no. It was not. It couldn\u2019t be here, not already, not\u2014\n\n\u201cDo you smell that?\u201d she asked.\n\nEzra sniffed. \u201cSea. Diesel. Pretzels. Me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, the other.\u201d\n\nHe breathed in again, exaggerated. His expression went from puzzled to amused to something Marin had never seen on him before. A little twist at the corner of his mouth that was not humor. \u201cOh,\u201d he said. \u201cGod. What is that. That\u2019s\u2014did a museum spill?\u201d\n\nIt was coming up from the south, that smell. The water seemed to carry it delicate at first, then like a dare. It coiled through the pylons and under the boards and made the seals in the harbor turn their whiskers toward it and then away. Marin\u2019s stomach did the thing stomachs do when you\u2019re about to be ill and also the thing they do on a rollercoaster. Two different instructions at once.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she lied. The letter in her pocket warmed like a coin in a palm that wants to spend it.\n\n\u201cYou told a lie you don\u2019t practice enough for,\u201d Ezra said.\n\nThe wind shifted again and it was gone or it was everywhere. Someone behind them sneezed and cursed.\n\n\u201cCome with me,\u201d Marin said, surprising both of them. \u201cThere\u2019s a place.\u201d\n\n\u201cA palace? A dungeon? A trapdoor?\u201d\n\n\u201cA plant shop in Pioneer Square. The owner owes me a favor.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously,\u201d Ezra said. \u201cThe princess of the water below the coffee capital goes to collect a favor in a plant shop. This is either a fable or an indie film.\u201d\n\nThey went up the hill and through an alley that nobody old enough to be wise walked down alone, and into the green-tinted sanctuary where the air was humid and busy with the respiration of leaves. Plants stood in clusters like gossiping girls; a fern arched over a shelf and tickled the ceramic mug below it as if it wanted to drink what the humans drink. The owner was there, covered in dirt in the way that is essentially a uniform, and raised an eyebrow when she saw Marin with an extra person in tow.\n\n\u201cPrincess,\u201d she said. Not teasing. Not bowing. Simply naming. \u201cYour timing is either awful or perfect. Did you bring me cuttings\u2014no, you brought a man. That\u2019s more work.\u201d\n\n\u201cLyra,\u201d Marin said, relieved. \u201cI need a door. Not all the way open. Just\u2014just a crack, to hear through.\u201d\n\nLyra\u2019s hands, wiped on her apron, were the kind of hands that knew when a pot was going to crack just by looking at the weather. She looked at Ezra like someone assessing a tool and then at Marin and then at the perspiring leaves that wanted everything to have a little more water, a little less. She nodded once and pushed a flat of succulents aside with a toe. Below the table, moss had been coaxed to carpet the concrete so thoroughly that it looked like green felt. Lyra knelt and knocked on a spot that to anyone else would have been an ordinary spot. To Marin it was an old friend\u2019s shoulder.\n\nThe knock was three beats in a rhythm that the city echoes if you stand under the Aurora Bridge at midnight and listen to tires on metal. The moss darkened. Then it parted.\n\nEzra made a noise he had always imagined he would never make. He reached out like a child on so many first days of school. Marin touched his wrist and he pulled his hand back quickly.\n\n\u201cStep here,\u201d Lyra said. \u201cWithout thinking about it too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhenever someone tells me not to think about something, I think about it intensely,\u201d Ezra said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can fix it now or later,\u201d Lyra said and looked at Marin. \u201cQuick.\u201d\n\nThey went down not so much into a place as along it, like sliding between threads. Marin felt the sudden change in light, the small pinch in her ears the way cabins do when you drive through mountain passes. She felt the brush of old things that have decided to keep their names. The air slid into her mouth sweet and cold and then almost sickening. Not because of what the place was, but because of what had reached it. The smell. It was here, too, diluted like poison in a lake but no less itself. A warning. A boast.\n\nOn the other side the corridor widened into a room that wasn\u2019t a room unless you liked your rooms nebulous and lit by the memory of weather. The walls suggested stone. The ceiling suggested a sky that somebody had been very careful to make just enough like a sky that no one would panic. There were chairs of the sort you sit in only if you remember to do it the old-fashioned way, with your back not in revolt. A table.\n\nMarin heard them before she saw them: a murmur like fish remembering to speak and then deciding it would be rude. Then faces. People she had seen her whole childhood until she left because to stay was to let everyone else\u2019s opinion of her calcify like a barnacle on a hull.\n\n\u201cHighness,\u201d said a man whose beard was a separate animal. \u201cYou came. How obliging.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeif,\u201d she said, and he flinched as if she had not the right to call him by his name. Perhaps she did not.\n\n\u201cAnd with a companion who reeks of coffee. The mortal.\u201d\n\n\u201cEzra,\u201d he said stiffly. \u201cOf Capitol Hill.\u201d\n\nA woman across the table smiled the way a knife smiles when it has just been sharpened. \u201cYou bring a boy into the Confluence. How droll. Do you intend to bring a whole band later?\u201d\n\n\u201cI intend to hear what you wanted,\u201d Marin said.\n\nThey told her what she had already read in the letter and more besides. They told her of reports from far harbors and near drains. Fish caught with lesions who smelled of compost. A bridge that sweated in the night with a slick that had no obvious source and offended a thousand noses when morning broke. Three seals found on a beach in a configuration that meant nothing to biologists and too much to anyone with a touch of old story in their blood. The smell turning up where it chose, regardless of wind.\n\n\u201cIt is deliberate,\u201d said Leif, tapping the table as if he could persuade it to agree. \u201cNot accident. Not decay as policy. The Rot is organizing itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call it that,\u201d someone at the back snarled. \u201cIt likes when you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does it like,\u201d Ezra said softly. \u201cDoes it like lamp shades?\u201d He hadn\u2019t meant to speak, Marin could hear that. She could also hear the trembling behind the humor, as if he had set a platespun on a rod and stood back.\n\nA girl on the left, sandy-haired and young enough to still show you what she thought before she could manage to hide it, leaned forward. \u201cIt is said\u2014if you will all stop chewing the old words for a moment\u2014it is said that a princess of Mire has returned. That she refuses to cover her impossible stench. That her odor is her weapon and her banner and the way she puts a foot in every house.\u201d\n\nMire. Marin tasted the syllable the old way and it tasted like turning over a rock and finding a thousand legs. It tasted like childhood dare games at edges where edges shouldn\u2019t be.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d said the knife-smile woman, and for a moment Marin wondered if the comment was to the girl\u2019s impertinence or to the saying of the place before there was permission to say it.\n\nThe room argued like a family around a holiday table. Deliberately forgetting to be decorous so that someone would remember on everyone\u2019s behalf and then be blamed for caring. There were proposals worth scraps of attention and proposals that sounded like someone had eaten a map and misread the legend. They all looked to Marin eventually, not young or old in that moment but simply necessary.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want me to do.\u201d She said it evenly and none of them could quite hide their relief at how she took the question as if it had been hers to begin with.\n\n\u201cThere will be a Summit,\u201d Leif said. \u201cCalled by us, but hosted where the four meet with minimal quarrel.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the Halfhouse,\u201d Lyra said. Marin hadn\u2019t seen her come through. Lyra stood near the door with soil on her knuckles, looks like the residue of any work a person could do that is not talk.\n\n\u201cYes. In the Halfhouse.\u201d Leif\u2019s beard flickered the way anything with hair says I disapprove. \u201cWe will speak with those who can speak for the other side. We will propose. We will barter. We will threaten to hold our breath and see who turns blue first. And you, Princess, will go\u2026forth.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo where.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere she is.\u201d\n\nShe. Pronouns older than swords, older than the first music. The room didn\u2019t breathe for a heartbeat. Ezra\u2019s hand found her elbow. She didn\u2019t know who he thought he could steady. Maybe himself.\n\n\u201cSend someone else,\u201d Marin said, and her voice landed with the dull surprise of something thrown in the wrong season. \u201cSend any of you. Send all of you. Send anyone who stayed to practice instead of leaving to lose the thread.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were named,\u201d the knife-smile woman said. \u201cThat is an answer. Why do you ask for another.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I am tired of being asked to be a machine,\u201d Marin said. It came out hard, harder than she meant. \u201cBecause this city fits me the way being a cog never did. Because I have a job that pays me in cash and in jokes and in the small good feeling of putting the right book in a stranger\u2019s hands. Because\u2014because.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all have small good feelings,\u201d Leif said, and he said it the way a man says it when he doesn\u2019t know this is a confession.\n\nLyra bent to examine a flaw in the table and said to the wood, which is to say to the room, which is to say to Marin: \u201cShe has to decide whether she\u2019ll answer. Don\u2019t make the decision into a trick. It will resist that and then you\u2019ll think magic failed you.\u201d\n\nMarin closed her eyes and saw nothing helpful. She saw the ferry. She saw Ezra\u2019s chipped mug in the sink because he insists it\u2019s his. She saw the gulls lined like punctuation on the rail. She saw her father\u2019s hands and the way they moved when he spoke of water as if it were a guest who could leave if it felt misunderstood.\n\nShe opened her eyes. The smell had crept under the door while they argued and was arranging itself in the corner like a guest who refuses to take off a wet coat. That was answer enough. She did not have to like it.\n\n\u201cWhen.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt dusk tomorrow, the summons will come proper,\u201d Leif said. \u201cYou will prepare and then you will go. I will give you maps.\u201d\n\n\u201cI bring my maps,\u201d Marin said.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d He couldn\u2019t help smiling at that. \u201cOf course you do.\u201d\n\nThe letter in her pocket whispered at her the way a bone on a string hitting a doorframe will whisper if the house wants you to hear it. She stood up. Ezra stood when she did because some habits stand on their own. Lyra put her hand, dirty, warm, on Marin\u2019s shoulder and squeezed once.\n\n\u201cTake a sprig,\u201d Lyra said, as if sending someone on a trip. \u201cOf something alive that remembers what sun tastes like.\u201d\n\nMarin reached blindly and her fingers found rosemary. She stripped a small strip and tucked it into the cuff of her sleeve so that its green spoke a private language against her skin.\n\nEzra touched the rosemary as if checking if it was real. He didn\u2019t ask if he could still come with her wherever with her meant. He didn\u2019t look at Leif when Leif frowned at him for breathing. He looked at Marin\u2019s face and in it he found the road they\u2019d take first: up through the shop and back down to the pier and then the night between now and dusk.\n\nOn the way out, one of the older women\u2014she wore her hair pinned in a way Marin remembered from a portrait in a corridor\u2014said softly, like a curse that is also a blessing: \u201cBeware her perfume.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou call it perfume now?\u201d Ezra said before he could stop himself.\n\nThe older woman\u2019s smile was not a smile. \u201cNames change as often as coats. Don\u2019t be fooled.\u201d\n\nMarin wanted to laugh and could not. They stepped back into Lyra\u2019s shop and Lyra said a thing under her breath and the moss rolled itself back down like a reluctant tongue. The humidity of the plants made the air honest again. Clocks outside were insisting it was later than anyone inside wanted it to be.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll walk you back,\u201d Lyra said. \u201cIf she\u2019s come this far, she\u2019s sniffing at your door. You\u2019ll want to wash your windows with vinegar and pinch salt into the tracks.\u201d\n\n\u201cSalt is expensive,\u201d Ezra said.\n\n\u201cSo is breathing,\u201d Lyra said.\n\nThey did as she suggested. They lugged a bag of rock salt up the stairs of Marin\u2019s building in Belltown while the landlord shouted pleasantries to someone on the phone and the elevator pretended it did not exist. Marin\u2019s apartment was two rooms and a view of the water if you stood on the bathtub and leaned out the window. It smelled like her and like notebooks and like toasted bread because she was unafraid to toast bread at all hours.\n\nEzra went at the window tracks with the seriousness he applied to everything that made him anxious. Lyra dotted the corners with something that smoked and then didn\u2019t. Marin put her coat on a chair and then took it off because the envelope was inside it and she wanted it closer and further away. She set it on the table. It pulsed. Ezra looked at it like it might sprout legs.\n\n\u201cTonight you sleep,\u201d Lyra said. \u201cOr you try. Tomorrow you go where you must.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know her?\u201d Ezra asked, surprising himself again.\n\nLyra considered. \u201cI know the way she smells. I know that she was always told to cover it. With spices and oils and flowers until the very air went blind. She hated that. You would, too. And now she wears it like a sash.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe princess of the place under the place,\u201d Ezra said. \u201cDoes she have any other descriptors besides what she smells like? That feels\u2014mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is mean,\u201d Lyra said. \u201cAnd it is convenient, and it is all some people ever learned to say about her. They made a scent into a story and the story into a destiny. People do that.\u201d\n\nMarin remembered, uninvited, the way the old stories described the princess of Mire: how her presence made milk turn and children cry and metal soot. How her hair tangled anything it entered like blackberry cane, how she spoke with a voice that left molasses on people\u2019s eardrums. How she cried once and her tears smelled so strong the dogs hid under the porch for a week. How she was told to bathe and bathe and bathe and never quite came clean because the word meant something else to her and they didn\u2019t say that word to her correctly. How when she laughed, which was rare, you could smell sweetness so intense it turned sugar to smoke. Marin couldn\u2019t remember any story with that laugh part in it. Did she invent it. Could she.\n\n\u201cShe will be worse alone,\u201d Lyra said, as if answering Marin\u2019s private weather. \u201cAnyone is.\u201d\n\nAfter Lyra left, Marin and Ezra ate soup that came from an orange carton because the soup they made themselves would have tasted like the fork in the road. They said nothing predictive and everything inane. They watched a dumb show and then the news and then turned the news off when it showed, meaning to be helpful, a map of smells reported in the last day.\n\nWhen Ezra left\u2014it was late and he had a cat of his own who would judge him for sleeping elsewhere\u2014Marin stood at the window and watched the blue neon down the block flicker in a nervous rhythm. She had an invitation on her table and rosemary in her sleeve and the city insisting, in gentle, annoying ways, that she belonged to it as much as she belonged to any realm.\n\nThe instructions came just before dawn when the rain finally decided to fall. It arrived as an ache in her left ankle where she had once scarred herself on a barnacle, as a word on the letter that hadn\u2019t been on the letter before and now was and had always been. It arrived in the way the kettle took longer to boil as if time considered itself savory, not sweet.\n\nMarin sat up in bed and said aloud to no one: \u201cAll right.\u201d The sound didn\u2019t fill the room. It didn\u2019t need to. It sat in the corner like a small animal that knows it\u2019s been named. She made coffee and held the mug with both hands because there are mornings when you need to hold a thing that hot to believe it is real.\n\nThe ferry in the bay blew its horn and the city looked at the sky like a lover who has already forgiven you one thousand times and will again make room. Marin smiled, crooked, and started to pack. She put maps in a bag; turned back and put more maps, then less. She put a sweater and a knife and a piece of chalk. She put a photograph of her father she almost never took out of the drawer, a man with a face that lit when water was mentioned. She put the rosemary in her hair and it made her look like she had not slept and also like she had a plan.\n\nShe almost forgot the letter. It hissed when she touched it, offended. She slid it into the inside pocket of her coat. It whispered to whatever lined the pocket, then went quiet the way dogs go quiet before they break their rope.\n\nOn her way out she pinned a note to the shop door with blue tape. Open late, it said. Maybe very late. Sorry\u2014princess stuff. Ezra would see it. He would save the joke and use it later because that is what you do with the things that keep you from breaking in half.\n\nThe bay was all metal and no light. The gulls lined the rail again, watching. Marin touched the iron, the cold, the paint in layers. She put her palm flat against it and felt the water\u2019s beat. It said different. It said beware. It said go now.\n\nShe went, moving as quickly as you can without running toward a meeting you cannot avoid. In her chest a small strong drumbeat kept time with the ferry across the water, with the city\u2019s heart, with something older and more complicated that had named her before she knew what names were. The smell threaded through the rain and into her lungs, not yet unbearable and yet not less itself. She breathed it and did not gag.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Marin said to the air, to whoever listened when you didn\u2019t know who did. \u201cYou invited me. I\u2019m coming.\u201d\n\nBehind her, in the bookstore, Sel stretched like an animal that knows when rain is about to slow. In another room under the city a table cleared its throat. Very far away and also close enough to touch if she only decided to extend her hand, someone laughed, a low roll like thunder in the barrel of a drum. It almost smelled sweet. It almost made your eyes water. It had been covering itself all these years and now had decided not to, and the choice was its own weapon.\n\nThe rain fell. The city let it, lovingly. The world shifted so slightly that most of the people in it would call it nothing at all. Marin, who knew better, kept walking.By noon the rain had taught itself a rhythm and decided to practice on every awning in Belltown. Marin walked under it with her collar turned up and her mouth tasting of coffee and rosemary because she had tucked the sprig behind her ear until the oils stained her fingers. Ezra met her halfway up the block, his scarf trailing like a streamer in a parade that no one had advertised, and he tried to say nothing in the way a person tries not to sing to a song already inside his throat. \u201cYou left a note,\u201d he said, and he held up the strip of blue tape he had peeled from the shop door as if it were evidence in a case about to turn on a technicality. \u201cPrincess stuff. You wrote princess stuff like it\u2019s laundry day.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is laundry day,\u201d she said, and she took the tape from him and set it on the lip of the trash can with the deliberation of someone making small bargains with the universe. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to think I\u2019d been abducted again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been abducted even once,\u201d he said, and he looked at her face to confirm this and then looked away because it made him feel the soft, unfunny part of fear that he preferred to dress in sarcasm. \u201cNot that I know of.\u201d\n\nInside the shop Sel was nowhere obvious and the heat had developed that kinetic personality old heating systems do when they believe they\u2019re part of the staff. The bell on the door clicked and then clicked again as if an invisible hand had taught it a joke and was repeating the punchline to steady itself. Marin hung her coat on the back of the counter and the letter inside it murmured against the wood in a language without vowels, and Ezra pretended not to hear because he had decided to be the kind of friend who does not require new rules every hour. \u201cWe could close early,\u201d he said while he arranged the geography shelf to show the spine of a book that had never sold but kept trying. \u201cOr we could close now. Or we could burn the store down and claim the insurance and use the money to flee to a landlocked state where the worst thing that happens is someone mispronounces rye.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not burning the store down,\u201d she said, and she smiled at him with half of a mouth because the other half had important business with the rest of the day. \u201cBesides, I like the way the floor complains. It will miss us if we\u2019re away.\u201d\n\nThey tried to let the hours behave. People drifted in with damp hair and opinions about the right size of a guidebook, and Marin wrapped packages in brown paper with twine and Ezra made change with coins that had been too recently in other pockets. The smell came and went like an argument in another apartment that you only hear when the walls have not had enough to eat, and when Marin looked at the window glass she saw not her face but a memory of glass less clear than this glass should be. \u201cIt\u2019s not just me,\u201d Ezra said when a woman at the counter flared her nostrils and frowned at the rafters because that felt safer than frowning at strangers. \u201cIt really is worse. It\u2019s like the city left something out of the fridge, and now it\u2019s daring us to taste it anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t taste anything,\u201d Marin said, and she wiped a square of the counter that didn\u2019t need wiping because it made her hands feel part of something she could still control. \u201cIf it offers a free sample, say no. If it offers a coupon, also say no. If it offers to fix your knee and your childhood, set it on fire and run.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose last two are difficult to do in tandem,\u201d he said, and when he laughed it was smaller than his usual laugh but it did the job he needed it to do. \u201cShould I chop onions so if I cry you can pretend it\u2019s the onions.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t own a pan,\u201d she said, and they both felt better for the scrap of normal given a place at the table.\n\nDusk in Seattle arrives like a polite relative with a suitcase, and that evening it shouldered the door open with a look that said I\u2019m only here until Sunday and then stayed anyway. The instructions, when they came, were not instructions until you noticed how they shaped the room around your noticing. The letter in her coat pocket swelled and shrank as if it were remembering how to be a lung; the bell over the door chimed a six-beat phrase that mapped onto nothing in the world of retail but exactly onto the way the ferry horns had conversed at sunrise; the neon sign across the street dropped a single blink and then held a steady light so calm Marin thought for a second she might weep. \u201cThat\u2019s very pretty,\u201d Ezra said, and his voice had found that place between wonder and dread that a person can live in only for a limited time.\n\n\u201cIt wants us to come,\u201d Marin said, and she took her coat and slid into it and felt the letter\u2019s chill like the back of a spoon against a wrist. \u201cWe should lock up.\u201d\n\n\u201cSel,\u201d Ezra said, because he had decided practical questions were a rope he could carry. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave Sel with the smell and the rain and the inventory.\u201d\n\nA gray tail materialized from under the travel books and Sel herself followed, stretching to the length of a moral dilemma and then blinking at them with a look she had borrowed from an ancestor who had once tolerated priests. Marin stooped and tapped Sel\u2019s forehead with two fingers and the cat turned her head to press against the hand because the contract between species had not yet fully dissolved. \u201cShe\u2019s hired the night watch,\u201d Marin said, and she set down a saucer with water that wasn\u2019t just water because a bit of rosemary had fallen into it and a few grains of salt had refused to be pinched into the window tracks and had tumbled instead into the dish. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine. She\u2019s the only thing that would survive if the entire city were shaved and put underwater.\u201d\n\n\u201cComforting,\u201d Ezra said, and he checked the back door twice, then once more for the superstition of it, and they stood in the doorway with the unfriendly dusk smelling their pockets to make sure they had brought change for its meters.\n\nThe city had made them a path that would not be a path to anyone else. Traffic lights luxuriated on green long enough to allow them to cross without breaking stride, and the street musicians measured their tempos so that the gaps between songs lined up as if a conductor had lifted a hand somewhere offshore. Down by the old ferry terminal a security chain lay puddled beside a gate without ever remembering it had once been the shape of a chain, and a gull with a missing foot watched them go with the satisfaction of a person who knows he will still be here after everyone has made their mistakes. \u201cI didn\u2019t know this door existed,\u201d Ezra said as Marin led him to an alcove where a vending machine sold nothing, and where the wall had the texture of a sentence scratched out and rewritten with more caution.\n\n\u201cIt only exists when the tide and the city have agreed over breakfast,\u201d she said, and she touched the metal panel that looked like it had always been a panel and felt it push back against her palm with the tenderness of something that hasn\u2019t been touched correctly in years. \u201cAnd when the Halfhouse wants to eat.\u201d\n\nIf anyone had been watching they would have seen two people stand too close to a vending machine and then vanish with the embarrassment of people who have realized they read the parking signs wrong. If anyone had been listening they would have heard the water shift its weight and then pretend it had always been comfortable. Ezra stepped through and found himself standing on a threshold that had been built out of accidents, and he took a breath so deep his chest admitted later it had been too ambitious. The air did not smell like nothing, because the Halfhouse would not submit to that lie; it smelled like plank, like warm plaster, like the rind of a fruit whose name no one had spoken aloud in three hundred years, and under it like the polite version of the Rot\u2019s perfume, the aftertaste of a word you have refused to pronounce.\n\nHe said \u201coh,\u201d but he did not say it as a single lost syllable. He said \u201coh\u201d and then he said, because his mouth was a creature that wanted to be helpful, \u201cthey never finished painting,\u201d and he meant the walls because the walls had coats of different colors that stopped mid-roller, and he meant the ceiling because the beams were half planed and half left to remind themselves of trees, and he meant the stairs because each step was a sample of a different carpenter\u2019s opinion of rise and run. \u201cIs it always like this,\u201d he asked, and he reached out for the banister and found that it became rope under his hand, then became something like iron, then became polished driftwood, as if it wanted to make sure no one felt excluded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never like anything,\u201d Marin said, and she took the stairs without looking like a person who trusts a thing that loves to change the subject. \u201cIt\u2019s like itself and then you are like yourself or you are not. That\u2019s the test.\u201d\n\nLyra waited in a doorway that was half open and half ajar, and she had abandoned her apron for a dress that looked like someone had woven dusk out of good intentions and then mended it at the shoulder with daylight. Her hands were clean, which made Marin like her and fear for her a little, and she raised her brows at Ezra in a way that said I see you decided to be brave on purpose. \u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d she said, and then she shook her head once because she knew that late and early braided themselves around summonses and that human clocks were ornaments the Halfhouse tolerated with amusement. \u201cNo, you\u2019re on time. Don\u2019t let Leif speak first.\u201d\n\nThe room beyond them had changed like a face learns to smile differently for a second photograph. The table was longer, and it had found a new compromise between water and wood and stone and glass, and Marin had the brief, horrible sensation that it had been eating while they were away. Delegates had arranged themselves the way people do when they are trying, failing, and trying again not to develop the grudges their grandparents cultivated with such care. Leif\u2019s beard had emancipated two additional curls, and the knife-smile woman wore a pin at her throat that made Ezra think of the sort of thorn that lives under a bridge and taxes the feet of the unwary. The girl with sandy hair waved at Marin with a quick, ingratiating tilt of the wrist, then withdrew her hand as if she had not meant to be friendly for that long.\n\n\u201cWe begin,\u201d Leif said, and he lifted a cup that contained a liquid that could have been tea or could have been the extracted patience of everyone present, and he drank the smallest possible sip and then set the cup down with the reverence of a man who believes he has done his part in a difficult ceremony. \u201cNews worsens. We have lost three drains on the southern run. They refuse to empty where they have emptied for a century and have opted instead to devote themselves to becoming gardens.\u201d\n\n\u201cGardens,\u201d the knife-smile woman said, and her mouth suggested that the word meant knives with flowers printed on their handles. \u201cHow charming, until the wrong things grow.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe wrong things always grow,\u201d said a man at the far end with shoulders like stacked crates. \u201cAsk a farmer. We are not farmers but we have eyes.\u201d\n\nA woman with a silver streak in her braid that had been applied by time but looked as if a design choice said, \u201cIn the mirrors at the art museum there were handprints at five this morning before the guards, and when they looked at the footage there was footage of handprints happening to the footage. We have drawn the curtains and we have told the docents to call it a commentary on labor.\u201d\n\nLyra did not sit. She stood with her hand on the back of a chair as if to anchor the chair in case anyone should become ambitious. \u201cThe roots under the transit tunnels had a dayling feast and then refused to sleep. They pulled three pilings because the pilings have been unfriendly for so long that friendship seemed like a prank. No one noticed because no one ever wishes to be told what holds them up until it fails, and then they wish it had announced its grievances like a person at a meeting.\u201d\n\nMarin listened with the steady blankness of someone who has decided not to cry because it would open a door she would not know how to close. Ezra listened and thought about buses and bridges and the trick in the neck he had when he had slept wrong, and he wondered what the city would sound like if the parts they never thought about decided to speak all at once. \u201cDo we know where she is,\u201d he asked, and he meant the princess with the perfume, and he felt a heat along his cheekbones that surprised him because he had not expected to be embarrassed by the question. \u201cYou talk about her as if\u2014look, I fold sweaters in retail when someone starts to shout because it gives their voice a hill to fall off. Would it help to\u2026insult her? Or praise her? Or send a casseroles?\u201d\n\n\u201cEzra,\u201d Marin said, and she touched his sleeve to place it in the category of human attempts that were bearable. \u201cWe do not casserole the other side.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know where she is because she wishes us to know where she is,\u201d the knife-smile woman said, and she had the peculiar light in her eyes of a person who enjoys no pleasures and so makes do with accuracy. \u201cShe has found a threshold that is willing to be disrespectful and she has knelt in it and taught it to be more so. She is in the Culvert of Eight Mouths, and if you think that sounds like a place we invented to frighten children you should imagine how it looks to a map.\u201d\n\nLeif slid a sheet toward Marin that was not a map until she put two fingers on it and told it that she knew where north lived, and then the lines grew stubborn and dark and arranged themselves into the southern belly of the city with its pipes and its seams. Ezra leaned in and felt the pull of a diagram that had not been meant for him but did not mind briefly letting him think otherwise, and he pointed with a finger he didn\u2019t realize he had put there. \u201cHere,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looks like\u2026a star that someone smudged.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a thing that opens several things at once,\u201d Lyra said, and she spoke so softly the table leaned in to collect the sound. \u201cYou can close it by teaching it to be ashamed of its options. You can also set it on fire. You could cover it with the kind of concrete only guilt knows how to pour. Or you could walk to it and ask it to choose you instead of her.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou make it sound like a lover,\u201d the sandy-haired girl said, and her expression implied she had heard about this but had not yet found a way to be enthusiastic.\n\n\u201cA threshold is a lover,\u201d Lyra said, and she didn\u2019t wait for anyone to flinch or snicker. \u201cWe think of doors as politenesses, but a threshold is a proposition. The city is full of them and you step over them all day thinking the contract is about shoes on and shoes off when the contract is about which version of you is allowed to pass.\u201d\n\nMarin set her hands on the map and felt the Culvert like a tooth you touch with your tongue because it has begun to ache and because you cannot leave it alone. The smell pressed in at the windows of the room and left its fingerprints on the glass, and someone in a corner near the suggestion of a hearth began to cough with the subdued determination of a person who refuses to make a scene but belongs to a body that disagrees. \u201cI go,\u201d Marin said, and she was grateful to herself for not making the sentence into a question. \u201cI go now, while it is dusk enough that the pipes will think I am not trying to be clever.\u201d\n\nLeif nodded because he had always liked her best when she sounded least like someone who wanted him to approve. The knife-smile woman relaxed by a degree measurable only by people whose job it was to know such things, and Lyra took a tin from her pocket and shook into her palm a line of dark seeds that smelled like a forest floor holding its breath at the edge of a burn. \u201cCrush them,\u201d Lyra said, and she poured the seeds into Marin\u2019s hand and then covered Marin\u2019s hand with her own as if they were bargaining over dice. \u201cSmear a little on your throat and on the inside of your wrists. It will not make you invisible. It will persuade some things that you have been seen already by someone worthy.\u201d\n\nEzra did not trust his voice and so he occupied his mouth with the act of finding the knife he knew was in Marin\u2019s bag and checking with his eyes and his fingers that it agreed to open and close when asked. He did not like knives unless they pretended to be butter spreaders, but he liked the idea of her carrying a dull blade less, and he liked the smell rising around the edges of the room least of all. \u201cI will walk you to the beginning,\u201d he said, and he was surprised by the fact that no one told him he could not. \u201cAfter that I will obey the part of me that isn\u2019t a teenager.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe beginning moves,\u201d the sandy-haired girl said, and then she looked down at her hands and was ashamed of the tone but not the words. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to keep up.\u201d\n\nThey took their time leaving because to leave a room like this badly is to insult it, and the Halfhouse exacts its rudeness tax in ways that are never financial. Marin folded the map into a shape someone had taught her when she was small and trying to turn everything into a ship, and Ezra collected his jangling thoughts and slipped them into his pockets like change that might be enough to pay for a late bus. Lyra walked with them to the gate that had not been a gate when they entered, and she stopped where the floor suggested tiles that suggested a kitchen where someone had once burned onions with the intention of making someone else forgive them. \u201cI will keep the rosemary alive,\u201d Lyra said, and she adjusted the sprig behind Marin\u2019s ear as if it were a misplaced comma. \u201cWhen you come back the city will not be the same. Try not to be offended on its behalf when it fails, for a while, to welcome your return properly.\u201d\n\nOutside, the night had congested itself into a shape the streetlights were going to need help to navigate. The ferry horns sounded like polite bulls in other fields, and beneath that Ezra could hear a low talk in the pipes that he would probably never be able to unhear now that he had heard it at all. Marin walked south not because south had ever agreed to be her friend but because enemies are predictable if you treat them correctly, and Ezra kept pace with his hands in his pockets so his fingers would not make promises without consulting him. Cars hissed; windows poured light and then reconsidered; a man on a bicycle applesauced his brakes at a corner and then grinned apologetically because the night had made him too fast and he felt bad about it. \u201cThere,\u201d Marin said when the street sloped and then lifted and then sloped again like breath, and she did not point because some places hold grudges against fingers.\n\nIt looked like a storm drain until you watched it and it became a mouth, and then it became eight mouths taking turns pretending to be one. The grate had been built in a decade that fancied itself practical, but vines had educated it in cursive, and a trickle had reconsidered trickling and swollen itself into a statement too dignified to splash. Ezra stood at its edge and felt the unpleasant pleasantness of being noticed by a thing that did not have eyes for him and had eyes enough regardless, and he swallowed and wished his saliva had more gallantry. \u201cThis is the part where I say don\u2019t,\u201d he said after he had assembled that sentence several times inside and found that each version left him feeling a different brand of cowardly. \u201cThis is also the part where I do not say it, because I have used that word too often on small things and it would be rude to waste it now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know the route for the first part,\u201d Marin said, and her left ankle ached the way an old bell aches on a quiet afternoon when there is no service and still a tolling chooses to ring inside its iron. \u201cAfter that the threshold will change its mind and we will change with it or we will be spat out and then I will have to come back and invent a story for Leif that he will not like and that will be fine. Hold this.\u201d\n\nShe handed him the envelope because even she had admitted that she did not need to carry all her names into every room, and he took it with the solemnity it demanded and resented that it demanded it and stroked the seal with his thumb because he had learned that touching things does not always make them worse. \u201cIf she is\u2026if she is like the stories, you shouldn\u2019t go alone,\u201d he said, and he hated the sound of his own caution because he wanted to be the kind of person who said run or the kind of person who said stop instead of the kind of person who said a sentence with two ifs. \u201cIf she laughs and it smells like sugar burning, if she cries and the dogs hide, if she tangles, if she brags.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is a person,\u201d Marin said, and she surprised herself with the anger in her voice because it had been living there quietly for years, and she had fed it crumbs because anger is easier to manage when it is hungry. \u201cShe is a person they made a scent out of because they did not want to use the word power. She can be cruel. She can be kind. She can be bored. She can be wrong. I am not afraid of her so much as I am afraid of everyone else\u2019s certainty about what she is.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he said, and he folded the envelope and put it under his arm like a newspaper and resolved to pretend it was a newspaper if anyone asked, and then prayed no one would because he had never learned card tricks and he did not now want to learn how to trick a city while standing on a curb. \u201cCome back,\u201d he said, and he liked that better than don\u2019t, and he liked that he could say it like a request and like a promise and like a cuss.\n\nShe stepped down to the lip of the culvert and felt the way the mouths nested, one inside another like bowls that have been used for mixing and for serving and for hiding money. The first breath was the worst; the first step was the worst; the second step was worse than she had expected because the smell pressed itself into her ears the way street noise does when you have fallen asleep and it has not. She laid her palm flat on the iron at the juncture where rust had won three times and been painted over four, and she whispered the compromise her father had taught her, the one that makes a pipe choose to loathe you quietly instead of loudly. The iron quit its version of sighing and the flow leaned to let her pass, and for a moment she was a girl at a door again and the door had decided, without flourish, that it would rather like her.\n\n\u201cKeep my seat,\u201d she said, and she did not add please because the city does not love that word in rooms like this, and Ezra nodded as if chairs had become creatures whose feelings had to be respected or they might one day decide not to hold anyone up. \u201cIf it rains harder, go back,\u201d she said, and she did not look behind her when she said it because she always hated being told to go home after she had set out, and she did not want to turn this into someone else\u2019s version of that.\n\nEzra did not answer because he had decided that his tongue would turn against him if he let it, and he watched her move down into the not-dark with a steadiness that looked like grace and felt like practice. The sound changed around her; the water learned her name and didn\u2019t know if it wanted to sing it or warn it, and the concrete changed the temperature of its attention as if to say I notice you and would prefer not to, and the smell tested the rosemary and decided it would not have her on those terms. She went anyway, and he watched until watching became seeing nothing, and then he listened until listening became a way of speaking without letting go of the envelope.\n\nThe culvert did not devour her; it accepted her with the affronted tolerance of a host who believes he has been surprised when in fact he has been warned. She moved past the place where snails hold small parliaments and through the place where a city engineer had once lost a glove and sworn into the acoustics until they bit him back, and the mouths opened and closed the way an animal will breathe more loudly when it wants you to think it is asleep. A slick grew and then dissipated under her boots when she refused to change her stride, and once she heard, ahead, the unmistakable sound of laughter pitched to carry only as far as it needed to carry. It smelled sweet and then not, like a jar of something thick left opened on a windowsill and then rescued by someone who hated to waste.\n\n\u201cPrincess,\u201d said a voice that would have been contralto if it had bothered with music, and the word did not curl with mockery so much as it sat up and watched what she would do. \u201cYou brought your wrist-salt and your green needles and your small knife. You brought your worries about your friend and your desire not to be a machine. You brought your stories about me in your mouth. How heavy are they.\u201d\n\nMarin did not stop, and she did not hasten because the culvert liked to make quickness into farce. \u201cNot as heavy as everyone else\u2019s stories,\u201d she said, and she chose her footing with the infuriating carefulness of someone who refuses to give a floor the satisfaction of a slip. \u201cI left those on a table where men could admire them and imagine they had made them themselves.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause, and in the pause the water found an old bottle and spun it so the bottle could remember being useful. \u201cGood,\u201d said the voice, and it came from ahead and behind and from inside the iron as if something had learned to speak through bolts. \u201cThen come measure me without them and I will measure you without yours. If you are lucky we will both be wrong.\u201d\n\nAt the curb above, Ezra sat down because standing had become an act of defiance and he was wearing the wrong shoes for that kind of rebellion. He rested his elbows on his knees and held the envelope as if it could catch the rain if the rain began again, and he hummed to himself not because he had a tune but because humming keeps the throat honest. Two gulls argued about nothing in particular, and then a third arrived and peered down as if to say he had always planned to witness something important this evening and would be disappointed if any of them backed out. The city leaned into its own sound and felt the shift of a person taking steps in a place where steps mean more than they ought, and it made the small, stubborn decision to keep its lights on a fraction longer than usual. It had been told too many times to leave the rooms dim for a mood it did not ask for.\n\nBelow, the mouths widened and narrowed, and Marin moved into the center where the echo behaved and where the smell was strongest. It was worse up close in the way a thing becomes more itself when it no longer has to pass through milk or morning, but underneath there was something else, something she could not have articulated to a room that thought it understood the words foul and pure. It smelled like loam not convinced it was rotten, like a pond deciding if it wanted to be barn or field, like a body no one had told the right story about. She wished, for a second, fiercely, unfairly, that her father were there with his lineman\u2019s hands and his jokes about pipes that needed flattery, and then she wished it less because wishing pulled you off your feet and she needed her feet to believe in her.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t cover it,\u201d she said into the half-dark, and her voice struck the water and made of it a dish, and she felt the way a listening happens in the moment before an animal decides if it must run. \u201cThey told you to love a perfume the way they love a lie. Don\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t put a flower on a wound and then force everyone to admire your bouquet.\u201d\n\nThe laugh did not come and she could not decide if that was victory. A shift did, though, a settlement as if something had crouched and then made itself taller so that it would not be accused of shrinking. \u201cYou talk like a city,\u201d said the voice, and it smiled, and she smelled sugar singe and then went past it into the flavor of green things steeped too long in hot water. \u201cYou use the time it takes for a light to change as a metaphor for patience. You confuse direction with mercy. Did you come to order me to stay small.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came to ask you to stop knocking on windows with your smell,\u201d she said, and if this was foolish then she would be foolish; if this was arrogance then she would accept it later when she was somewhere other than here. \u201cIf you want to build a road between our rooms, build it with stone. If you want us to meet in the Halfhouse, meet in the Halfhouse. If you want to make a city sneeze until it confesses what it never meant to hide, you will make of us only a chorus of non-words.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou care about their noses,\u201d the voice said, and it was curious not cruel. \u201cYou care about their little forks and their chalk. You care about their sleeping. Does your caring make you less mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes me more mine,\u201d Marin said, and she closed her eyes because the culvert had always tried to glamor people into looking where they ought not, and she had learned that sometimes you gain more by refusing the geography. \u201cAnd you are not my owner. We were not meant to be each other\u2019s cages.\u201d\n\nSomething touched her ankle lightly, and she did not kick not because she was brave but because she knew that anything she did not understand down here would take any suggestion and magnify it into law. A current swirled with intent and then smoothed itself respectful, and she smelled, suddenly, clean stone after rain, and realized she was being assessed with a nose other than her own. \u201cThey said you ran,\u201d said the voice, and this time there was laughter in it and none of it asked permission to be pretty. \u201cThey said you left the rooms meant for you because they were interrupted by your breathing. They said you were tired of being named and tired of the way your name brought you plates and then debt. They said you went to smell coffee instead and learn sarcasm. How is sarcasm. Does it hold when the bridge shakes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does if your friend is on the bridge,\u201d she said, and she opened her eyes and found herself at the place where the eight mouths met, and it did not look like a mouth at all but like a choice made eight times and regretted not once. \u201cIt holds if you also have a rope. It is not my rope. It is just something to put on the rope so your hands remember they are part of you.\u201d\n\nShe did not know what the rules were for meeting a princess who had been reduced to an odor by people who didn\u2019t want to say power, and whatever ceremony had been written she had not studied, and so she did the thing she always did when the script failed her. She put her palm flat against the iron that ran like a spine through the middle of the mouths, and she pressed until the chill of it crept up into the bone of her hand, and she said her name in the way no one puts on paper, and then she said, because it mattered and because it was the thing that they never refused to record, the name of the city that had claimed her first without talking it over. The water stood up for a heartbeat, and then it bowed, and then it remembered its contract and continued to pretend it did not care.\n\nAbove, Ezra counted sixty and then counted sixty more because numbers have always been a way to remain inside a moment once it tries to spill you. A man with a dog asked if he was okay, and Ezra said he was waiting for a friend, and the man nodded because that is a phrase that makes people generous, and then the dog sneezed, and Ezra felt awful for the small insult the air had delivered to its nose. The envelope pulsed once and then went still like a child falling asleep on a couch that will have to be converted into a bed, and he thought, briefly, about every job he had ever had that had asked him to be patient with a person pretending to be telling the truth, and he laughed because no one here would be impressed by how well he handled returns.\n\nBelow, the laughter returned where the iron met the notion of sky, and it came from someone this time and not just a place. The woman who stepped from the turn of the culvert did not glow, because only fools ask that of other people, but the space learned to see in the way a face learns to recognize a new lamp. She wore no crowns and the fish who had found their way into the culvert did not bow because fish know what they know and do not care for theater, but the air arranged its weight around her with a deference that made Marin\u2019s lungs pay attention. Her dress was the color of olive brine, and her hair had climbed itself into snarls as if it were determined to build refuge without assistance, and her eyes were the color of a bruise that has chosen the day it will stop being one. The smell moved with her the way heat does when a door opens in winter, and it made a case for itself that did not entirely repulse.\n\n\u201cYou brought rosemary,\u201d the princess of Mire said, and she smiled in a way that made you think of gratitude and then of knives used to butter bread. \u201cThat is either polite or passive-aggressive. I have always respected both.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt reminds my fingers what green feels like,\u201d Marin said, and the truth made the conversation sit more calmly than a lie would have. \u201cI thought you\u2019d prefer that to incense.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate incense,\u201d the other woman said, and she lifted her hands, then let them fall, and every rivulet in the place rethought its commitment to its present direction. \u201cThey used to smudge me until I wept. The men with the long sleeves and the women with the clean skirts. They tried to smoke me out of myself and then they told me I was ungrateful for the effort. What a normal thing to do to a girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cNormal,\u201d Marin said, and between them a small fish tried to leap and then changed its mind because you were supposed to save your energy for when the right mouth opened. \u201cStupid. It does not matter which word we choose because all of our words are rotten if they refuse to admit what they have done.\u201d\n\nThe princess tilted her head as if listening to something arriving from far away, and for an instant Marin smelled sugar so powerfully that she tasted a childhood dessert she had adored and then resented because it had been offered as a consolation when she had wanted justice. \u201cYou did not come to scold me,\u201d the other woman said, and there was wonder in it and Marin did not know whether to be happy or sad that wonder could live in that voice. \u201cThey rattled their letters and their seals and their tin cups and begged me to be ashamed. You came with no bells. Why.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I am so tired,\u201d Marin said, and she laughed, and the culvert held its sound against its ribs like an animal considering whether to keep a stray. \u201cBecause I do not have the breath to pretend you cannot smell like what you smell like. Because I want the city to be able to eat breakfast without thinking it has sat down to dine in a cellar. Because I think you are lonely and I think that makes you loud.\u201d\n\nThe princess of Mire did not lower her eyes and she did not flare her nostrils either, and she looked past Marin at the eight mouths agreeing, for once, to be a single throat. \u201cIf I quiet,\u201d she said, and she said quiet like a verb that had been punished early and often, \u201cwill they open something for me. If I quiet, will they allow me into rooms where they keep the keys. If I quiet, will they stop inventing stories that make children spit when they hear my name.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Marin said, and because she could feel how that landed she kept speaking so the refusal would not have to sit in the room alone. \u201cNo, they won\u2019t do any of that until they think it was their idea, and maybe not even then. But if you quiet it will be because you decided to and not because they made you. And if you decide to be loud it will be because you are singing and not because you are banging on our windows until our crockery shakes.\u201d\n\nThere was a long minute during which the culvert asked for everyone\u2019s attention and received it, and the smell shifted through pastures it had not met recently and forgot, briefly, to be a weapon. The princess lifted a hand to her own throat and rubbed the place a perfume bottle would have claimed if she had tolerated bottles, and she wiped the oil across her fingers and then into the water as if to baptize a thing that does not require baptism. \u201cYou are a person,\u201d she said at last, and she made person sound like a promotion. \u201cYou talk like a pipe and like a girl and like a city with its hair down. If I say I will come to the Halfhouse and sit in a chair that is made of materials I do not love, will you keep the knives from my back with your mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d Marin said, and she meant with words and with the tone a person uses before a storm, and she meant with lies that were not lies so much as shapes of truth people could be made to accept. \u201cI will tell them a better story. I will tell them that no one likes to be smoked. I will tell them that we are tired of smelling each other\u2019s fear.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d the other woman said, and the sugar went out of the air as if she had drawn it back into herself not like a trick but like breathing. \u201cGood. I will come. I will come tomorrow with my shoes on and my hair as it is and my wrists unpunished. I will come and I will let them look and then I will tell them where I have been.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring no incense,\u201d Marin said, and she almost smiled because the words felt like a protection even if they would be ignored.\n\n\u201cI will bring a jar of something to sweeten their tea and they will not know whether to drink it,\u201d the princess said, and she stepped back so that the water could forget she had been in its middle. \u201cTell your bearded man to sit on his beard. Tell the one with the pin to take it from her throat and put it on her shoe. Tell the girl with the hair that she should come closer and not speak unless she intends to say she was wrong. Tell the plant woman to water the rosemary until it shouts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d Marin said, and she drew breath for the first time in minutes without noticing because it had been so long since her lungs had been allowed to do it without interference. \u201cAnd you\u2014don\u2019t knock at dawn.\u201d\n\nThe princess laughed, and it broke and reassembled and came back with a sound that might have been kindness. \u201cI have never once knocked,\u201d she said, and she turned, and as she vanished into the right-hand throat she left behind a filament of scent that did not smell like rot at all but like the first time you crush a leaf and finally understand what someone meant when they named the plant. \u201cI have pushed. You are the first to push back with the right degree of shoulder.\u201d\n\nWhen Marin climbed back toward the street her knees discovered how many decades they believed themselves to have endured, and a drop of something found its way inside her collar and down her spine, and she did not shiver because cold has always liked to be rewarded. Ezra stood at the curb with his jaw set and the envelope under his arm and the look of a man who has chosen not to interrupt the conversation he wasn\u2019t invited to, and when he saw her he released his jaw and put, without flourish, the letter back into her hand. \u201cHow was the museum,\u201d he asked in a voice that wanted to betray him and did not quite succeed.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s coming to the Halfhouse,\u201d Marin said, and she felt the truth of it seat itself across from her and open its napkin and pick up its knife with the good manners of a person raised to pretend. \u201cTomorrow. We have to tell them before they decide they know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should bring\u2026cookies,\u201d he said, and he was only half kidding, and his mouth did a thing that meant he was trying to balance the weight of what he had not been allowed to see with the weight of what he now had to hold. \u201cSomething for the table. Something to make everyone remember their better selves.\u201d\n\n\u201cLyra will glare at me if I arrive with sugar,\u201d Marin said, and she looped her arm through his because anchors carry the responsibility of being lines as well as weights. \u201cShe will glare at me and then she will eat them when no one is looking. We\u2019ll stop at the bakery with the bad coffee and the good butter.\u201d\n\nThey walked up from the mouths the way you walk up from any place that has asked you to remember and then remember differently, and the night watched them with interest because nights, too, get bored with repetition. In a window, a woman watered a plant and then apologized to it for forgetting; at a corner, a young man practiced a speech that would go badly and then go well when he changed one sentence; from the bay, the ferry signaled a thing that meant the deckhands had found something in a coil of rope and were undecided whether to keep it. The smell loosened its hold and retreated to the edges where it planned, and Marin breathed until her lungs understood again which job belonged to them and which to the part of her that wanted to be a machine because machines don\u2019t get asked to cry.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll hate it,\u201d Ezra said, and he didn\u2019t mean her, and he didn\u2019t mean the other woman, and he didn\u2019t mean anything except the sound a room makes when it realizes it was not the first to receive news. \u201cThey\u2019ll hate that you went and made a promise before they could steam the table.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll pretend to,\u201d Marin said, and she thought of Leif and his cup and the knife at the woman\u2019s throat that would be on her shoe, and she thought of the sandy-haired girl and the way she would look at the visitor as if she had never seen a person with a problem and then realize that was what they all were. \u201cBut they wanted this. They always do. They never want to ask for it because then they would have to thank whoever brings it, and gratitude is the heaviest glass.\u201d\n\nAt the top of the hill he stopped and she stopped because a moment had requested to be noticed, and he reached with his free hand and wiped with his thumb the smear of oil Lyra had told her to put on her throat. He held his thumb up and smelled it and made a face without theatrics, and then he smiled because it was an honest face and he trusted those more when the city had decided to use perfume as punctuation. \u201cYou smell like standing in a garden after it rains,\u201d he said, and he let his hand drop because his thumb had done its work. \u201cAnd also like the back room of a bar that refused to allow cigarettes and so still smells faintly of cherries. I can work with that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all any of us are doing,\u201d she said, and they walked into the part of night where the lights knew their jobs and the windows performed the trick of letting people watch without being watched, and somewhere the Halfhouse shifted its weight to make room for new chairs. The ferry called again and the gulls answered badly and no one minded because the language they shared didn\u2019t care for pitch so much as endurance, and Marin felt in her ankle and in the letter and in the rosemary the small, insistent tug of tomorrow assembling itself.By morning the rain had lost interest in scolding and settled into the more companionable work of filling grooves, and the city wore its wet like a knit cap. Marin woke to the hollow applause of tires on the soaked street and lay for a breath listening for the ache at her ankle that told her a summons had not been rescinded. It pulsed once in the place where a barnacle had bitten her years ago and said the smallest version of yes. The letter on the table had turned itself slightly, as if it had been looking out the window while she slept. It smelled faintly like what iron remembers when you rub it with a lemon. She made coffee with the vengeance of a person who has decided to trust the simplest machines, then held her mug over the sink so her hands could believe steam was not just a myth this city told itself in winter.\n\nEzra arrived with a white box tied in red striped string because theater matters to pastry, and when he opened it the small, proud faces of cookies looked up like townspeople gathered to vote. His scarf was a catastrophe and his hair was on the civic council of static and he spoke in a tone pitched deliberately light so it would not crack under a weight it had not been trained to carry. \u201cThey were out of the plain ones,\u201d he said, and he held the box as if it were a controversial document. \u201cThese have sugary grief sprinkled on top. The clerk swore it was sea salt, but I\u2019ve been lied to by bakers before and survived, though not unchanged.\u201d\n\n\u201cLyra will forgive the sugar if the butter is honest,\u201d Marin said, and she reached into the box and rearranged the cookies so that the ones with the most enthusiastic crystals were tucked under the modest ones. \u201cWe\u2019re not bribing anyone. We\u2019re lubricating the mood, which is different if you grew up in a house where adjectives had moral hierarchies.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou grew up in a house with nouns that glowed under certain lights,\u201d he said, and he eased himself onto a chair and put his chin on his fist and considered her with the seriousness he saved for strangers in expensive boots. \u201cYou slept. Or you pretended at a professional level.\u201d\n\n\u201cI slept the way the pipes do when a ferry cuts its engine at the slip. They remember to be quiet and then they gossip about the quiet.\u201d She tucked rosemary into the collar of her coat so that when she moved it touched her throat like a small hand with good intentions. \u201cShe\u2019ll come. She said so. Sometimes that\u2019s a spell.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd sometimes it\u2019s an RSVP left on read,\u201d he said, and when he smiled it was the smile of a person trying to find the nerve to believe in the better outcome without appearing naive. \u201cLeif will enjoy being told what to do. Please let me watch that happen. Please bottle it. Please line the shelves with it between the rare atlases so that on slow afternoons we can take it down and pour a shot.\u201d\n\nShe buttoned her coat and the letter snicked against the buttons like a fishbone stubborn in a soup. The smell outside had retreated overnight to the seams of things and kept its counsel there. Marin could feel it in the elevator\u2019s cables and in the chalk line where the curb had been mended last spring by a crew that listened to baseball on a radio slightly older than the foreman. \u201cYou keep the box,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll carry the map that isn\u2019t looking like a map yet and the letter that wishes it could be a knife.\u201d\n\nThey walked the four blocks between her door and the vending machine that wasn\u2019t, and in that distance they saw six umbrellas betray the wrists that held them, one dog choose dignity over a puddle and then reconsider, a woman in a puffer jacket weep without theatrics at a bus stop as if grief was a scheduled service she couldn\u2019t afford to miss, and a child in boots so red they altered the weather around them by stubborn will alone. Marin found it comforting the way rain flattens everyone\u2019s hair to a common denominator; she liked a city that didn\u2019t make fusses to pretend it wasn\u2019t feeling anything, and this morning Seattle wore its feeling on every awning.\n\nThe Halfhouse tolerated them early the way a good hostess tolerates guests who don\u2019t know when the table expects them. Inside, the air carried the breath of bread and tile and fresh-cut boards, and Lyra was waiting in a room that had decided today it preferred to resemble a parlor freshly invaded by carpenters. She had damp soil on her forearms in green-grey smears and had gathered her hair into a braid that had its own opinions about straight lines. On a trestle beside her a rosemary in a clay pot had been watered until its upright stems looked faintly arrogant. \u201cI woke it,\u201d she said when Marin looked at the plant as if it had spoken. \u201cYou asked me to make it shout. It has opinions about the acoustics in here. I told it the Halfhouse refuses condescension and the rosemary agreed to behave.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I put my pin on my shoe now,\u201d said the knife-smile woman without looking up from where she was instructing someone with a ledger to draw a line in ink that should look like a suggestion, not a rule. She wore no pin today at her throat and there was a glint of metal at her instep that looked like a small, embarrassed star. Leif, who had either slept in his beard or arranged it in his sleep for maximum commentary, sat with his hands on his knees to keep himself from drum-tapping the table into an admission of something undignified.\n\n\u201cYou put it there if you intend to keep your word,\u201d Marin said to the woman and to the room and to the idea that ceremonials crumble without the participation of the people who despise them. \u201cLeif, sit on your beard and not your opinions. You can keep your opinions on your lap if they behave. The girl with the sandy hair\u2014come closer. Don\u2019t speak until you mean to apologize. The apology may be for yourself and not for us. That counts.\u201d\n\nThe girl\u2019s mouth pulled into a line that might become soft if you fed it enough humility, and she moved to the edge of the table as if the wood would bite if she rushed it. Across from them the older woman with the portrait hair had secured a handful of dried bay leaves to the back of her shoe with thread that had belonged to her grandmother. She did not appear to expect anyone to notice and would be offended if they did, so Ezra pretended to become fascinated by the grain of the table and the way it refused to run entirely straight like wood under the influence of a conversation.\n\n\u201cWe have not lit incense,\u201d Leif said, and there was injury in it, which in him looked like a humorless man startled by his own failure to be obeyed by himself. \u201cI told them no. They love to light things and crowd the air. I told them to hold their hands in their sleeves and think their thoughts by themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Marin said, and she set the pastry box down near the end where the chairs were polite enough to hold the weight of human generosity without creaking. \u201cWe brought cookies. They are salty whether or not the baker intends them to be. This is not a bribe; it is a suggestion. Take the suggestion in your mouths before you take it into your agendas.\u201d\n\nEzra watched a dozen glances ricochet off the box with the wariness of clergy considering a gift from laypeople, and he had to look at the ceiling to keep from laughing when Leif\u2019s hand moved toward the lid and then stopped and then moved again as if participating in a dance he had not been told was choreographed. The knife-smile woman took a cookie, examined the salt crystal as if she could interrogate it into peril, then ate it and closed her eyes for a moment like a person who has been holding her breath for a week without noticing. Her shoe pin winked in what could be construed as gratitude.\n\nThe room arranged itself for being told news, and Marin told it. She said the princess of Mire had agreed to come to the Halfhouse without ceremony and without being smoked and without wearing other people\u2019s apologies. She said she had asked for no titles and no throne and only a chair that would hold her and a room that did not insist on pretending that air had never met her body. She said she had asked them to stop knocking with smell at dawn and would come as soon as the pipes agreed to walk her without devouring her cuffs. This reporting should have been uneventful, but news is a live thing, and it set the table to humming and the walls to paying attention.\n\n\u201cThey will say we brought a storm into a stable,\u201d Leif said, and he ate another cookie defensively, like someone chewing a doctrine. \u201cThey will say we were lax and then say we were tyrants in the same breath. They will say the word rot and they will say the word perfume and they will mean neither. If we let her in, we allow the city to believe it is normal to invite the under into rooms with windows. If we bar the door we lose the right to call ourselves a Concord.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop thinking of doors as moral instruments,\u201d Lyra said, and she set a small bowl of damp earth near the head of the table where light fell grudgingly. \u201cThis is not a parable unless you force it to be. This is a meeting. Let it be one. We can choose courtesy without agreeing to become rugs.\u201d\n\nThe mirror delegates arrived like a rumor into which a person had put effort. They came through the paneling by moving the light rather than wood, and each of them wore expressions that were difficult to read because they were busy translating their faces from a dialect glass prefers. The one in front had hair the color of clean blades and held a hand mirror with the solemnity of a toddler carrying a sibling down a staircase. She bowed as if teaching gravity etiquette. \u201cWe have covered the museum glass,\u201d she said in a voice that did not echo, which was in itself a courtesy. \u201cIt sulked and then agreed. We have asked the fountains to say nothing unnecessary. We have brought a room that can hold what will be said if it turns out to be heavier than the chairs.\u201d\n\nMarin looked at them with the old affection she had for things that are both honest and not to be trusted, and she felt the way the Halfhouse approved their entrance, which was a relief because the Halfhouse\u2019s disapproval has been known to make people sprain their ankles in rooms that do not own stairs. \u201cYou\u2019ve been reflecting what doesn\u2019t belong to you,\u201d she said, and she didn\u2019t mean it as an accusation so much as a diagnosis. \u201cYou know it. The smell is multiplied by glass. Ask it not to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe asked,\u201d said the second mirror-woman, whose cheekbones had taken a shine to being mistaken for knives. \u201cIt said there was nothing of it that didn\u2019t belong to us already. It said breath has been using us since breath learned to make windows fog. It said no. We have been feeling bruised and have decided to stop inventing metaphors about it.\u201d\n\nThe ferry horn in the bay sounded, and the mirrors turned their heads a fraction, which is their way of admitting they are charmed by something. Ezra, who had been trying to figure out if the delegates in reflective clothes dimmed when the sky did, let his eyes catch the wave of attention moving through the room as if a wind that had never been outside had dared to come in. The Halfhouse likes to announce arrivals to itself before anyone knocks, and in the marrow of the floor he felt the small lurch that meant it was time to practice their surprise.\n\nShe came without flourish and with all the flourish a body brings by being wholly its own weather. The smell preceded her but it did not punch. It arrived like a heavy fabric lifted and then set down with care, and underneath was a line of sweetness that did not intend to beguile so much as it insisted on being named correctly. The princess of Mire stepped between two chairs and stood with her feet apart in the posture of people who have had to learn how to take their own height seriously, and she looked around the room with a gaze that did not flit, that did not judge, that did not forgive. She did not wear shoes as contrition; she wore shoes because the day was cold and she did not intend to arrive as naked metaphor.\n\nLeif\u2019s beard tried to leap up to remind him it had things to say; he kept it seated. The knife-smile woman lifted her chin and displayed her throat as bare as it had probably been in decades, and then she looked down at her shoe and was faintly pleased to see the pin there doing its tiny, punishing work. The sandy-haired girl stepped forward without being prompted and did not speak. Ezra watched the mirror delegates not flinch, which means they flinched nobly, and Lyra looked at the floor to give the floor a chance not to betray its habit of curling its edges toward things it loves.\n\n\u201cThank you for not burning anything that smells like a priest,\u201d said the princess, and her voice felt in the room the way iron feels in the mouth when the blood has surprised you. \u201cThank you for eating butter with your anger. Thank you for moving your knives off your throats. Thank you for allowing a person to be a person and not an epithet wearing a dress.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a bowl of dirt on the table,\u201d the older woman with the portrait hair said courteously, as if reporting the weather. \u201cWe brought it to help the room remember to breathe. You may laugh at us. We cannot stop you.\u201d\n\nThe princess lowered her face to the bowl and inhaled like a woman who has not been allowed to inhale without apology, and her expression softened into something that made the smell around her change its mind about being a weapon. \u201cYou put soil on a table,\u201d she said, and she looked at Lyra as if she had just been introduced to someone who might understand her jokes. \u201cYou are asking a room to understand bodies. Good. You are already better than the last set of chairs that asked me into them.\u201d\n\nMarin didn\u2019t wait for Leif to take the podium of his own throat. She spoke before the room could turn its attention into a cudgel. \u201cWe have what we always have,\u201d she said, and she put her hands on the table so the table would know whose voice to weight. \u201cWe have a city. We have a shoreline that thinks it can be a straight line and then learns it is a curve. We have other rooms under this one and under those and a room that insists on being on the other side of every glass anyone ever had the nerve to polish. We have people who understand that smell is a language well before it is a weapon, and we have people who pretend to be allergic to what they don\u2019t want to name. We have a princess who has been refused a pronoun that does not reduce her to what she does to milk. We have a Council that would prefer to be a chorus and has learned that sometimes it must be a throat. We have biscuits.\u201d\n\nLaughter around a table at a moment like that is less humor and more oxygen, and the room breathed. Leif unclenched enough to remember that he had older impulses than instructing chairs. The mirror women tilted their hand-lamps ever so slightly until the light in the room was flattering without lying. Ezra could see the corners again; his head stopped rehearsing catastrophes and started to file away the small, bright fact that people can be better than their training when biscuits are present.\n\nThey got down to the old business that was new because someone had named it: the smell had been showing up where it wished, and the water had been carrying it where it had never had the intention to go, and the glass had been reflecting it with a vanity it thought of as helplessness, and the below-rooms had been flattered by the attention and then sickened by it in a sequence anyone who has ever been complimented recognizes. Leif produced a sheaf of reports bound with a string he had been saving for a celebration that kept not arriving, and the sandy-haired girl added notations about drains that choked, and Lyra arranged the bowl of dirt closer to the edge of the table so that people who could not bring themselves to breathe could look down and be instructed by the sight of something reasonable.\n\n\u201cIt is not only her,\u201d Marin said when the murmurs began to do that thing murmurs do when they have convinced themselves they have labored into a conclusion. \u201cDo not point with your noses and call it proof. It\u2019s bigger than a person. The Culvert knocked because she taught it a new rhythm, yes, and then it knocked on its own because thresholds love attention like anyone. But this\u2014what we are smelling at odd hours in rooms that have no business being damp\u2014this has another hand on it.\u201d\n\nThe princess stood still as a doorway. The smell around her did not flinch at being accused of ubiquity. \u201cThere is a refinery on the far side of a mirror,\u201d she said in a tone that made Ezra think of train tracks and the certainty with which they proceed. \u201cIt used to bottle sweetness. It bottled it so diligently it forgot to ask where the sweetness came from. Now it does not bottle anything. It was closed by men who insisted it was a profit that had ended. It was not closed properly. The glass remembers, and the pipes remember, and every door that has been allowed to stick instead of oiled remembers. When I moved, the remembering lifted with me because it enjoys a parade.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe art museum,\u201d said the mirror woman with the blade hair, and she tilted her glass so that Marin could see herself turned into an intention. \u201cOur footage did not show the handprints being made in the way you would like evidence to show you its work. Our footage learned a new job. It is possible this refinery has learned how to use polish against us. It is possible the smell has become a mirror that does not need us anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sugar,\u201d Ezra said, and he startled himself by speaking because the room had been allowing him the courtesy of invisibility. \u201cIt\u2019s not metaphorical in the way you mean. It smells like sugar at the edges when it is being proud of itself. It smells like sugar when it\u2019s normal to be proud. And then it smells like a lie. I\u2019ve worked in a caf\u00e9 you would disapprove of because the owner calls coffee \u2018beans\u2019 in a tone that contains a secret handshake, and I\u2019ve burned syrup and had to clean it out of a pitcher. This is like that, but with a family history.\u201d\n\nMarin wanted to kiss his forehead, which would have made four different people at the table cough for different reasons, and so she settled for saying, \u201cHe\u2019s not wrong,\u201d in the way one says about a useful tool one had not admitted to needing. \u201cThe refinery. The glass. The thresholds wanting to be lovers. We are telling one story in here, and the city is hearing eight. If we are not careful, the version the street repeats will be full of words none of us put in its mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you propose,\u201d the knife-smile woman asked, and she asked it like a person who has been betrayed by proposals wearing perfume. \u201cWe cannot right a factory with compliments. We cannot tell a smell to mind its manners and expect it to apologize on paper. We cannot enjoin a story to stop telling itself, not even when it is making a mess on our rugs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can bring you sweetness you cannot resist, if you desire to be instructed by your bodies,\u201d the princess said, and she reached into the pocket of her brine-colored dress and brought out a jar that had never belonged to any kitchen. It was not exactly glass; it had the look of something that had been a river once and had been persuaded to hold a specific shape for a while. The contents were not exactly syrup; they were what happens when a certain kind of attention is allowed to reduce. She set it on the table and the table tilted infinitesimally as if adjusting its own spine to accommodate a guest of honor. \u201cYou will not drink it,\u201d she added, and she smiled in a tired way. \u201cYou will put it in the corners and on the lips of mirrors and at the mouths of drains and on the backs of doors that have decided they will not shut on a Tuesday. It will call to itself, and when it arrives it will be tired and we can teach it to sleep.\u201d\n\nLyra bent to look as if she had been handed a seed the size of a fist and told it contained a grove. She did not reach for it because some jars are still part of their maker\u2019s skin. \u201cThis is sticky with a willingness I have missed,\u201d she said, and the rosemary on the trestle breathed hard enough that a small fog gathered around its needles. \u201cWe will need to teach everyone where to stand while you do this. We will need to tell the city to put its fingers in its pockets and not touch anything.\u201d\n\nLeif\u2019s mouth opened to ask the kind of question men with strings in their papers ask when they wish to avoid appearing to approve prematurely. He didn\u2019t get to ask it. The air near the mirror delegates whitened like breath on hard cold, and for one unpleasant beat the Halfhouse reminded them it had a sense of humor about panic. The mirror woman with the hand glass stiffened and made a small shape with her mouth that made the glass in her hand bow with relief. \u201cThere is a door,\u201d she said, and her even voice went uneven for the space of two syllables. \u201cThere is a door that has decided it should be a mouth. Someone is trying to come in without a knock.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou invited her,\u201d Leif said with satisfaction that should have embarrassed him. \u201cShe is here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not she,\u201d the mirror woman said, and she put her hand up into the air as if proffering it to a horse, and whatever had been thinking of using the air decided to apologize and did not, and then did again because apologies sometimes require practice. \u201cThis is a smell trying to find a face. We will not permit it. It is\u2014oh.\u201d\n\nThe oh contained the kind of awe you normally reserve for the moment a child you had not expected to be musical sits down at a piano and invents a chord that has always existed. The smell that rolled into the room was not the princess\u2019s. It was not courtesy. It was not refinery. It was the odor of sweetness forced and possibilities exhausted, and it tried to make itself comfortable by covering the bowl of dirt with its palm. Lyra said a word that would scorch wallpaper if your grandmother had ever let you say it in her house, and she slammed the dirt bowl closed with her hand as if smothering a small, daring fire.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s using the Halfhouse,\u201d Marin said, and she could feel in her ankle and in her jaw where the room had agreed to hold its ground and where it had been tempted to flirt with collapses. \u201cIt\u2019s using our generosity to pattern itself. It doesn\u2019t have a face; it wants to borrow ours.\u201d\n\nThe princess of Mire\u2019s smile went away like a candle someone hadn\u2019t remembered to be careful with. She stepped around the table as if stepping around a decision. She lifted the jar and unscrewed the lid with a growl of something that had nothing to do with threads and everything to do with having fingers. \u201cWe can stop being gentle,\u201d she said, and she tipped the jar and let a thread of what was not syrup and not light fall onto the edge of the table.\n\nThe Halfhouse uncharacteristically said thank you, which is to say the way the grain misbehaved settled into a better line for a fraction of a breath. The smell that had been playing at being a guest turned itself toward the sweetness as if it had been humming nonsense and suddenly recognized a tune. The thread spread and became a circle the size of a saucer and then a pond not larger than a dinner plate, and the air above it learned a lesson in gravity it had thought beneath it. The smell gathered itself with a kind of offended swiftness. This is the only way to catch a thing that thinks it is a cleverer version of your own mood; you give it what it cannot refuse and then you ask it to show its teeth.\n\nEzra did not breathe because he had learned to treat breath like currency and he liked to be paid for his efforts. He watched the shiny ring expand with the terrible eroticism of caramel hitting cold marble. The mirror women held their glass tilted at an angle that would insult sunlight but flatter any person whose skin refused to be called a surface. Leif\u2019s fingers dug into the underside of his chair because his hands had been idle for too long. The sandy-haired girl had tears on her cheeks that made rings like old pennies when they hit the wood and spread and went shy.\n\nFor one ridiculous moment Marin thought of advertisements, of pictures in old magazines where spills behaved like polite actors and messes limited themselves to photogenic ovals. Then the Halfhouse leaned, the jar in the princess\u2019s hand pulsed, and something at the edge of the sweetness snarled like oil taught to speak and failed to find its consonants. The jar hummed. The table attempted to lift the bowl of dirt with a corner and became embarrassed at the strain.\n\nThe courier from the bookstore stepped out of the wall where it had never been, and her coat hissed with droplets that did not belong to their weather. She did not look around as a person would who had been astonished; she fixed her eyes on the circle of sweetness and her nose wrinkled in a gesture that, on another face, might have been human affection for the antics of a child. \u201cYou started without me,\u201d she said, and her voice had lost nothing of its fencepost strength. \u201cIt would have been politer to wait and less intelligent. Good. Now you will want to stand back.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t knock,\u201d Leif said, because if he did not say something irritable at least once every three minutes of a crisis the beard might choose to emancipate itself on ethical grounds.\n\n\u201cI never knock,\u201d the courier said, and she raised one hand, and for the first time since she had walked into their lives at the travelogues Marin realized that the courier\u2019s hands had been unadorned. There were no rings. There were no scars that made a story you could read without asking. There were only knuckles that knew what wood sounds like when it is lying. \u201cThe refinery did not shut properly,\u201d the courier said without moving her mouth very much, because speech was a commodity in rooms like this and you didn\u2019t spend it on repetition. \u201cThe glass has been persuaded. The thresholds were flattered. You have built a trap with candy. Excellent. Now a suggestion. It will go for the sweet and call itself in, and when it does you must be slower than you want and faster than you fear.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow,\u201d the mirror woman asked, and she asked it with interest and not with fluster because she was tired of the taste of being blamed for the crimes of her kind.\n\n\u201cClose it with something dirty,\u201d the courier said, and she put her two fingers into the bowl Lyra had been protecting as if the dirt could become banished by noticing, and lifted them covered in a paste that smelled like the underside of a rock and the bottom of a pot left too long after beans. \u201cPut the earth on your lip and say no so the room hears it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to lick the table,\u201d Ezra began, and then Lyra had already done it without making it into a show, and her mouth left a dark smear on the bright wood and the room made a sound like a hand clapped over a child\u2019s mouth in a game that had forgotten, briefly, that games can grow teeth.\n\nThe sweetness inhaled as if it had encountered a dare, and the smell collapsed toward it in a spiral Ma rin\u2019s father would have called beautiful and refused to look at because it told him the story of a whirlpool and the end of boats. The jar in the princess\u2019s hand warmed until the air around it shivered. The dirt line tightened its throat. The mirror women tilted their faces like geese aligning for migration as if a wind that had never gone outdoors was moving through the room. Leif whispered something into his beard that sounded like the first half of an apology shaped as an instruction. Marin smelled the rosemary and the soil and the sweet and the old iron of her letter and felt all of them braid themselves into a rope that might hold if they held it correctly.\n\nIt went wrong in the direction that told them they might still deserve luck. The smell poured itself toward the ring as if it had been hoping for someone to command it, and then at the last possible breath it remembered itself and pushed. The jar bucked in the princess\u2019s hand as if offended to be outsmarted by its chosen prey. The floor under the table leaned two degrees toward forgiveness. The sweetness would have spilled if a room like this admitted spillage. Lyra put her palm flat on the smear of dirt and the smear reddened as if blood in another story had reached across to be useful in this one. The courier tasted the air as if it had been brewed and detected notes of coal and cathedral and factory whistle and fear. Marin said no in her mother\u2019s voice because her own voice felt too tired for the job and immediately wished she had not, and then recognized that wishing is a worse habit than lying.\n\nThe circle held. It quivered the way a road quivers in heat when the cars have gone and the street decides it owes no one its solidity. The smell gathered what there was of itself and leaped, the sweetness flared like a decision, and the dirt stole the leap and taught it how to be a wall instead of a window. The ring\u2019s surface went from shine to something that lived between shine and dull and then settled at a texture she would have called skin if she had been telling Ezra a fairy tale and had wanted him to sleep well. The jar calmed. The room took breath. For a moment everyone stood with their mouths slightly open as if they had all forgotten in the same instant they had been sharing air all their lives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in there,\u201d the sandy-haired girl whispered, and no one reproached her for speaking. \u201cIt\u2019s like a bee in a glass. It hates the sides.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pity it,\u201d the knife-smile woman said softly, even as her own mouth wanted to shape the word mercy because words have habits that do not always cooperate with your principles. \u201cIt will not pity you. It does not think the way you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know that,\u201d Marin said, and she did not know why she felt the ache behind her left eye that meant she was about to adopt an unpopular stance out of principle. \u201cWe know it is something that is tired of being unnamed and has discovered that rooms like this allow you to feel like an adult. That makes anyone cruel. Keep your hand on your shoe pin and your thoughts in your head and your sugar off your tongue. We will talk to it when it has learned how to hear.\u201d\n\nThe princess did not look away from the circle, which had begun to emit a smell not unlike a memory of a bonfire in wet weather. \u201cYou always make chairs talk so much,\u201d she said to no one and everyone. \u201cIt is astonishing you get anything done.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou came,\u201d Lyra said, and there was pride in it and not the kind that has to be admired to survive. \u201cThat counts as something.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does,\u201d the courier allowed, and for the first time since anyone had made the mistake of calling her a messenger she showed the habit of humor like a woman remembering she had once had a scarf she loved. \u201cHowever, you have made a jar work in a room that eats jars if they belong to the wrong stories. Now you will keep it from learning that trick. Someone must carry it where you want it to be while this house still thinks well of you.\u201d\n\nEzra\u2019s mouth, which had been determined not to volunteer anyone but himself for anything, beat him to speech. \u201cI can carry a jar,\u201d he said, and he said it the way he said I can close tonight when a friend threw in a text that contained both a request and four different types of exhaustion. \u201cIt is not heavier than a cat and it does not have claws.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has claws,\u201d the mirror woman said, but her smile reached her eyes for the first time. \u201cThey are made of expectation. Yours or its. Be careful which you trim.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will do,\u201d the princess said, and she looked at Marin and then at Ezra and then at the circle as if considering the new geometry. \u201cHe has the right kind of wrists. He has learned not to drop what he thinks he cannot afford to replace. He will smell like this for a month. It will make his ex text him at two in the morning. He will survive.\u201d\n\nMarin felt her ribs attempt to learn a new choreography and decided to let them. \u201cGive us six cloths,\u201d she said to no one in particular and the Halfhouse in general. \u201cNot cotton. Not linen. Something that remembers being a tree but has gotten over it. We will cradle the plate in the box that used to hold cookies. We will walk it where it needs to sit. We will do it before the city notices we have begun and decides to comment.\u201d\n\nLyra produced cloths out of a drawer the Halfhouse was proud of despite their strained relationship with drawers. The mirror women breathed on the glass until the room could see where air wanted to live. Leif took his hands off his knees and put them to work tying the string around the pastry box with the awkward concentration of a man teaching himself a new knot with too many eyes on him. The knife-smile woman took her pin from her shoe and pinned the corner of one cloth to the corner of another because sometimes making a tent for a thing teaches it what obedience feels like before you ask for bigger obedience. The sandy-haired girl said thank you to the jar, and the jar said nothing, and that felt like excellent manners.\n\nWhen the circle was transferred to the lined box and the lid lowered with the tenderness of a grave\u2019s first spade of clean earth, the room shook itself and remembered it had other business. Ezra took the box. He felt the weight with his forearms first and then with his fingers and then with his mind, the way anyone who has carried a sleeping child or a cake or a confession learns that there are different ways to fail to hold something. He breathed in through his nose and frowned, then smiled, because the smell on the box did not make him want to gag. It made him want to put the box down somewhere he trusted and then go stand outside in a patch of sun that might or might not exist. \u201cWhere,\u201d he asked, and he hoped to God someone would say a single street name with a single block and perhaps a landmark that likes cougars.\n\n\u201cThe refinery\u2019s shadow,\u201d the mirror woman with the blade hair said. \u201cThere is a place south where the glass remembers more than it ought. It will admit you if you arrive holding its cousin. It wants to be forgiven. It wants to be used again. It will ruin everyone if we grant it its wish. We must teach it to want something else.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe go now,\u201d Marin said, because the city and the jar and the smell had begun to develop the kind of interest in one another that leads to stubbornness. \u201cNow, before the ferry turns and the tide reminds us who we are.\u201d\n\n\u201cI come,\u201d the princess said, and the room tried to invent a rule that would forbid it and failed in a way that pleased it. \u201cI would like to meet my old enemy on a day when I am clean and wearing shoes. It will not believe itself.\u201d\n\nLeif began to suggest a guard, and the courier looked at him with the flat affection of a woman deciding not to educate a dog. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, and she made the word tender as if speaking to a flame that needed to be smaller. \u201cGuards make doorways bloom teeth. We will go with a boy and a jar and a princess and a woman who knows where to put dirt. It will not think it is a procession. If we carry flags we will be bitten.\u201d\n\nMarin looked at Ezra and he looked at the box and then at her, and in that quick loop of glances was the kind of promise you overhear by accident and pretend not to. He slid one hand under the box, then the other, then rose without bending at the waist because his teacher in the gym class he failed for attitude had been right about the way backs prefer to be treated. He would not be offended by whatever the city decided to call him today. He was a boy; he was a mortal; he was a friend. He was a person a jar could use to get somewhere it had decided it was owed.\n\nThey left by a hallway that had been a kitchen on Wednesday and was a hall of mirrors today, except none of the mirrors insisted on showing them their faces unless asked. The Halfhouse hummed over their shoulders a blessing so old it had forgotten the words and converted itself into rhythm. Lyra carried the bowl of dirt as if anyone watching would think it a centerpiece and not a weapon. The princess of Mire walked without looking to see if anyone followed, the way people do who have been abandoned often enough that they have decided not to look back until the leaving is done.\n\nOn the street the rain had cooled to a fine brush of paint across cheeks and knuckles. The city made them a single long green, and the gulls turned their eyes toward the box and then away, and a bus paused at a red that wasn\u2019t and waited with its heart idling to let them pass. Marin felt the letter in her coat heat and cool and heat again in a rhythm that didn\u2019t belong to this day, and she told it silently to be still, and in a miracle of diplomacy it obeyed. South grew up in front of them like a sentence that intends to be kind and only manages to be efficient. The air changed in ways only people looking for it notice. Ezra had decided to be one of those people for the rest of his life whether or not he survived pastry delivery under duress.\n\nWhen they reached the stretch of street where the glass held long, foolish recollections\u2014an old warehouse converted into offices for people who write instructions for machines that do not need them; the shell of a factory with windows pocked like a tired face; a chain-link fence that had taught itself to sing in wind\u2014they stopped because the stop came up out of the pavement and under their feet. The mirror women lifted their hands not to perform a ritual but the more dangerous act of acknowledging one in progress. The princess took the jar out again without unscrewing the lid and held it up like a lantern no one had been told to be afraid of. Lyra put her bowl of dirt on the hood of a car whose owner would find a ring later and decide it had been left by a meteor and forgive the weather for once.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d the courier said, and she did not point because pointing makes doors vain. \u201cIt is here, where the glass has been trying to pretend it is just windows and has been smuggling a throat into work. Set it at the seam. Not in the middle. Not where you think the story would put it. At the corner. Make it inconvenient. Make it human.\u201d\n\nMarin knelt despite the scream her jeans made for the laundromat. The smell under her hands rose to meet her and then paused out of courtesy, which told her more about the refinery than any invoice would. She touched the seam between brick and metal frame with two fingers that had convinced pipes to love her and felt a quiver like a shock that had been waiting since before she was born. Ezra lowered the box with a care that would have shamed a surgeon. The circle inside showed no desire to be dramatic. It lay there like a lake not yet discovered by people who insist on water skis.\n\n\u201cNow the part everyone hates,\u201d Lyra said cheerfully, and she dipped two fingers in her bowl. \u201cWe dirty it.\u201d\n\nShe smeared a crescent on the top edge of the box where the lid met the side, then another on the lower left corner, then pressed her thumb into the third smear as if to sign a document with an ancient pen. The mirror women held their breath because they liked the way the air felt when it had been used. The princess of Mire laughed once and did not apologize because her laugh was the sound of someone who remembered her jokes and had not been asked to explain them.\n\nThe smell lifted. It leaned. It wanted what was being offered because the sweetness offered something neither apology nor repentance can: employment. The glass in the factory face in front of them shivered. The air behind it gave up a draft as if someone had opened a door in a pantry. Marin put her hand on the edge of the box and whispered her father\u2019s compromise, the one that persuades a pipe to loathe you quietly, and then she said the city\u2019s name and then she said hers, not to introduce herself but to remind the day what name it had agreed to use when requesting her.\n\nSomething came forward that was not a woman and not a machine and not a story and not a city. It smelled like all of them and like the expectation of sugar when your tongue has been promised salt. The jar in the princess\u2019s hand hummed; the dirt in Lyra\u2019s bowl warmed and then cooled like a body thinking. The glass took a breath and decided not to break. Ezra felt his muscles do the thing they do when a train passes under your feet and you pretend you don\u2019t know why you are suddenly steadier. The mouth that was not a mouth touched the lid of the box with the idea of a tongue and then decided to go in.\n\nMarin did not move and did not blink until the hair on her arms requested permission. The circle pulsed and then went flat and then pulled like breath. The smell poured and then did not. The city let the ferry horn be quiet for a beat long enough to make the absence a sound. The refinery\u2019s shadow shrugged and lost an ounce of itself. The jar, for the first time, cooled in the princess\u2019s hand. Lyra wiped her thumb on her apron and discovered she had been weeping on one side of her face and not the other, and decided she would permit that asymmetry as a treat.\n\n\u201cThere,\u201d the courier said, and if she had been a person given to sighing she would have allowed herself one. \u201cYou have taken its vanity away and left it the job. Now you will tell it, over and over, that it is work. It will try to be glory. You will yawn at it until it is bored into usefulness.\u201d\n\nEzra wanted to say that he was very good at boredom and had never expected to weaponize it, but his mouth chose to remain part of his face and he accepted the compromise. Marin stood up and her knees made a bitter poem about their lives. The princess of Mire put the jar in her pocket and it knocked against a small flat stone that had probably been waiting there for a decade for a day like this. The mirror women allowed themselves to look briefly proud. Leif, who had followed at what he believed to be a stealthy distance and what was actually an act of leadership in the wild, stopped chewing on the inside of his cheek.\n\nIt was not the triumph one would hang a portrait for. It was not a victory a statue could bear without looking silly. It was a job done well enough in time and in rain and in the sight of a city that valued mundane miracles because anything less obvious embarrassed it. Marin looked at Ezra and he looked at her and then down at the box like a parent checking to see whether a child had finally fallen asleep, and she felt fatigue roll through her all the way to the ankles where thresholds like to write their notes.\n\n\u201cBack,\u201d she said, and the word in this context meant not only to the Halfhouse but to the living, to the business of bringing people paper in a bag and telling them you had been out of their favorite magazine for three weeks and you were sorry and you had ordered it special and this time it might come. \u201cWe go back. We bring it to a table that will not forget why we brought it there. We do not congratulate ourselves until something worse happens, and then we will regret not congratulating ourselves, which is a funny joke the city likes to tell.\u201d\n\nThey started walking, and the light did the city\u2019s old trick of changing in a way that made people believe the day had more hours than it ever does. The box was so much lighter in Ezra\u2019s hands he resented it for not respecting his effort, and then forgave it, which is to say he forgave himself for being the kind of man who wants objects to admire him. The princess of Mire\u2019s smell now had the decency to stick close to its source unless called, and the rosemary in Marin\u2019s collar had decided to turn from green to a dim, private silver that smelled like a good grudge more than a good plan. By the time they reached the vending machine that wasn\u2019t, the gulls had adjourned to find new arguments, and the only person watching them was a boy of seven who had been told not to lick the railings and had already licked them and was worried three different myths might be true. He sniffed, frowned, then smiled because the air smelled like something he could describe later when someone asked him what his city had smelled like, and he wanted to have an answer that made his mother say oh and nod.\n\n\u201cWe will have to invite the factory to apologize,\u201d the mirror woman said when they paused in the door to be greeted by a room that had learned the difference between respect and fear. \u201cIt will be awkward. It will want to send a letter through three hands and pretend it wrote no words in the margins. We will make it stand and use its own throat. You will all wish to burn something. Try not to choose me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one here is arson,\u201d Lyra said, and she set the bowl of dirt on the table where the jar had made the wood remember how to be good. \u201cBut some of us enjoy matches. We can take turns holding them without striking.\u201d\n\nThe princess of Mire put her hand on the table and left a clean, invisible print that the wood pretended not to feel. \u201cTomorrow again,\u201d she said, and there was no drama in it, which made it feel like prophecy. \u201cUntil the city learns what we smell like when we are all in the same room and not trying to impress each other\u2019s ghosts.\u201d\n\nMarin reached into her pocket and felt the letter obligingly not bristle at her touch. She thought of her father with his pipes and his pipe jokes, of the shop with its bell and its cat whose opinions would survive the apocalypse unfazed, of Ezra\u2019s scarf trying to be an ocean. She imagined the refinery with its throat clearing and its fear of becoming useful again after such a long rest. She imagined the jar on the Halfhouse table making a small, contented circle against which no one could reasonably rail, and she imagined, despite herself, an apology delivered properly, which is to say by someone who believes he has better things to do and does them anyway but first says he is sorry and means it.\n\nThey sat because you sit when the room allows it, and when Ezra opened the box enough to peek, the sweetness inside looked up and did not glare. It regarded them with the bland interest of a blessing that has not decided how it will be distributed. The smell hovering over it was not beautiful and did not want to be, and this felt like progress. The Halfhouse shifted a fraction to one side, and the ferry horn chose that moment to interrupt, and outside the rain held back as if it wished to hear what words chairs would require next.By afternoon the Halfhouse had decided to smell faintly of lemon rinds and wet bread, which is what happens when you clean tables with the same cloth you used to bless them. The jar had been seated in a corner near the suggestion of a window, a square that did not admit weather but remembered it perfectly, and the circle within went on breathing without breathing, an obedient pond refusing to show any faces. People passed it like you pass a stranger with a bandaged hand in a grocery store; you make yourself small and larger at once, you smile if you have the nerve, you do not pretend you have never hurt the same way.\n\nMarin felt the long tired of jobs that become rituals before anyone has drafted their liturgy. She stood with both palms on the back of a chair because this helped and refused to examine why. Ezra, whose arms had decided they were heroic now that the box weighed less, insisted on carrying it the last inch onto its shelf even when it no longer required his nerves. He had developed a way of walking around sweetness as if sweetness carried static in its skirts; he did not want to betray a tiny shock when he brushed against it, because pride that small can ruin a day\u2019s patience.\n\nLeif pretended not to hover. He pretended the way a tree pretends it doesn\u2019t miss the birds in winter. The knife-smile woman\u2014someone finally said her name with a glass-clink of regret, a name that wore syllables like jewelry, Vessa\u2014kept her pin on her shoe and her mouth in a neutral position like a veteran of older ceremonies. The mirror delegates arranged the light so thoroughly you could have taken a picture at any angle and not embarrassed daylight. Lyra watered the rosemary until the pot wept and then turned the plant away from the jar as if shielding a child from the sight of its first adult disappointment. The courier stood where the wall decided to be door-adjacent and practiced, with no vanity, the art of not taking up parts of rooms that did not belong to her.\n\nThey planned the apology with the fatalism of people who know exactness is not a guarantee. The refinery had to be made to speak; this was a consensus built as slowly as a bridge designed by committees. It could not apologize by proxy through the men with clipboards who walk abandoned sites and pronounce them condemned; it could not send a paper letter on letterhead that smelled of dust and lawyer; it could not hire a PR firm to teach its windows the tone of regret. The Halfhouse disliked being addressed by a draft.\n\n\u201cWhat does a factory use for a throat,\u201d Vessa asked, and her voice made room for foolish answers without inviting them to stay for dinner. \u201cIf we call the owner, we will get an apology constructed of money and fear of liability. If we call the last foreman, he will tell us about accidents and the boy who cut his hand on a belt. If we call the night watch, he will fall asleep and we will be accused of keeping men from their rest. We can invite the river and she will say we have never listened correctly to the sound metal makes when it is bored.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe conveyor belts,\u201d Lyra said, and she pressed her fingers together as if squeezing an idea to see if it would leak. \u201cThey were tongues. They told the sugar where to go, and they learned how to be cruel when nobody oiled them, and they were taught to carry and not to refuse. Put grease on the right one and it might remember speech.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrease is a language of its own,\u201d the mirror delegate with the blade hair said, and she turned her hand mirror to look at herself and then at the jar like a friend comparing two outfits. \u201cIf we grease a thing in this room, the room will kiss it and then demand vows. We need to be specific. We should not ask for confessions unless we are prepared to hold them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is another throat,\u201d the courier said, and the room turned because even her interruptions arrived like letters sent registered. \u201cThe boilers. Quiet now, but lonely, and loneliness is rhetoric. They are vessels used to being filled and emptied, and no one has spoken to them since the last foreman kissed one and told it to try not to explode that night. They will apologize, if properly cupped. They will be better at it than any man.\u201d\n\nLeif\u2019s beard looked ready to offer an oath about boilers and the dignity of metal; his hands compromised and arranged papers with the tenderness of a man who mistrusts his temper. Marin let the idea of the boiler settle into her chest and wait there, warm and a little too grand. She remembered, unhelpfully, being ten and pressing her cheek to the hot copper pipes in their house until her father cuffed her lightly and told her some loves can boil your face if you\u2019re not careful. She had liked that hurt for its commitment. She now suspected she had grown into the exact sort of person who cannot be trusted unsupervised around machinery and regret.\n\nThey would go back, then, not to pour the sweetness into a maw and walk away hoping the city would lose interest, but to sit the jar beside a boiler and teach it to be heard. They argued briefly over tools like you argue over names for a cat you have already learned to whistle for; the names slap at each other and the creature ignores them both. Ezra volunteered the wrench he kept under his sink for emergencies that turned out to be philosophical, not plumbing, and Vessa produced an oil can that must have belonged to a cousin in a story she never told. Lyra promised dirt again, because dirt is an argument closer to the ground, and the mirror women offered glass that could be persuaded to echo when echoed into.\n\n\u201cYou should bring something from here that can pass as theirs,\u201d the older woman with the portrait hair said, and she slid a folded cloth from a sleeve with the smooth competence of a magician telling you she was only interested in paying the bill. \u201cA rag. Nothing dramatic. It should smell like people. We are allergic to grandeur in this jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nEzra took the cloth and sniffed it because his body believed in technique before dignity. It smelled like lemon and a thousand fingers, like books carried and put down and carried again. He imagined the rag inside a factory that had taught its dust to stay where it was told and found that imagining less arrogant than he expected. If you bring a touch into a room that has raised itself without being taught, the room might change its mind about what company is.\n\nBefore they parted to gather what they needed, the princess of Mire drifted a step closer to the jar she had fed and frowned at it in a way that did not admit affection. Her dress had taken on a darker green as the day wore itself out; there are fabrics that are worse at lying than people are, and brine does not permit pretense. Her hair, untamed, had made elaborate arrangements around itself. For a breath she looked like someone who had never had to be ashamed to be recognized by her smell, and Marin felt a jag of longing for a reality that had been denied before either of them were named. The princess rested the backs of her fingers near the jar, not touching, and the sweetness inside tilted, one surface molecule at a time, to greet what it thought might be kin.\n\n\u201cYou will not behave,\u201d she murmured, and she was speaking to the circle and to the day and to herself and to every threshold in the room at once. \u201cGood. I have had my fill of well-behaved days.\u201d\n\nMarin slept twice that night, once on her couch and once in the kind of nap you can only have when you resent yourself for taking it. The rain auditioned against her windows and won the part. She dreamed of stairs that changed flavor under her feet, walnut and salt and flour and the lime you touch to a glass to make it more willing. She dreamed of her father leaning under a sink with the confidence of men who love correct wrenches; she dreamed he looked up at her and his face was Ezra\u2019s and then Leif\u2019s and then nobody\u2019s, which unnerved her until she found her own hands in the dream and they were steady. She woke with a sentence in her mouth like a coin: boilers are just hearts you can talk to without anyone accusing you of romance.\n\nThey met without ceremony under a sky so low it had opinions about umbrellas. The refinery sprawled like a lie told by a landscape that thought it could still get away with older fashions. Fences wore signs with warnings that had become performative: no trespass, keep out, private property, the words so polite they had started to beg. The mirror women walked as if they were not walking on anything but their own reflections, which is a neat trick but makes you miss potholes; Lyra watched their ankles and said a prayer to whoever manages the setbacks of the elegant. Vessa wore a coat with a collar high enough to annoy the wind, and she looked like she had ordered weather before and had it corrected. The courier put her hand flat to the fence for a moment to borrow its attention, then took it away again as if to prove she intended to return it.\n\nEzra carried the rag and the wrench and had convinced himself the box should remain behind in the Halfhouse because they had no business bringing dessert into a conversation about atonement. Marin carried the jar not because it was heavy but because it had the gravity of certain kinds of letters. The princess of Mire, shoes and all, walked to the gate, which had learned how to be locked in three languages and twelve padlocks, and set her palm on a square of metal like the way you comfort a dog that never learned to be touched in a way that didn\u2019t hurt. The lock did not melt because this wasn\u2019t that kind of story, and also because metal has its pride. It shivered, however, in a way that told the hinges this was not the day to be stubborn.\n\nInside smelled like men who swore for sport and then learned to swear because it helped the belts believe in their jobs. The sweetness was gone from the air; what remained was its architecture, molasses evacuated, the ghost of caramel, the brittle sugar dust that coats the fillings of teeth long after the pastry has been eaten. You could hear the birds that had braved the rafters and you could hear rain negotiating with broken panes, and underneath was the long, patient breath of machines that no longer have to be good. Marin liked it the way you like a room full of objects that would be grateful to you if you deigned to thank them for their service out loud.\n\nThey found the boiler without finding it. It made a shape in the dark that dark tries to avoid out of respect. It sat like a bishop in a game no one had asked it to join, too big for both the board and the rules, and it waited. When Marin stepped close, heat lived in it still the way warmth holds in a theater after the actors have left because the story has not finished using the room. She set the jar down gently as if seating a guest you were not sure would like your friends and put her hand to the old iron, and its skin leached a cold into her palm that had decided to be an opinion.\n\nLyra pushed up her sleeves and laid a thumbprint of dirt on the rusted flange where two pipes met, then another on the spot where someone once scratched his initials without admitting to himself he wanted to sign his life. Vessa tipped oil onto a hinge that had no hinge work left and watched the metal think about it. Ezra tucked the rag in a seam low on the facing and realized with a start he was tucking a child into a bed in his head, and then decided not to confess this because he could feel the boiler\u2019s dignity bridle at being made into a cradle. The mirror women angled their glass so that light pooled on the plate with the manufacturer\u2019s letters, a name no one had said aloud in this city in thirty years popping up like a fish for a fly.\n\nMarin leaned close enough she could feel her own breath return to her, warmed by iron that had opinions about other opinions. She did not ask the room for permission to start. She said the name of the factory\u2014not the proud one on the spiral-bound calendars of the 1970s, but the older, dirtier one that workers used to tell their wives where they would be late, the name with a swear nested in it like a baby bird in a wreath. She said her name; she said the city\u2019s. She said, with the extraordinary calm of someone willing to be ridiculous, \u201cWe are here for the apology, and we are not leaving until you show us where you keep your throat.\u201d\n\nThe boiler did nothing that would convince a camera. Cameras have always been so greedy for the wrong proofs. It waited. Then it decided to practice a new trick: it gave back the sound of rain, but only the syllables the factory had believed belonged to it. It breathed in the word steam without steam. It made a sound like the sleepy cough of a chain. It tried the pitch of a pipe notched by a wrench handle, and somewhere a pigeon on a beam looked up as if told the hour had changed. Vessa did not smile, and this was how Marin knew it mattered.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me beg,\u201d the princess of Mire said, and she stepped into a knowledge of space that the machine could recognize. \u201cWe have both been spoken over enough. The favor is for you as much as it is for the city. You will feel better when you have spoken. Do not expect them to forgive you immediately. Forgiveness makes chairs slouch. We are not opening a school; we are closing a book that was left face down.\u201d\n\nThe boiler accepted a compliment it had not realized contained a demand. It thought about the people who had touched it and given it fear and praise, which is to say people. It considered the first day it had been lit, fed coal by someone who sang badly because he was afraid of thinking, and the last day when a man with narrow shoulders said, fine then, and clanged a door shut he had never believed he would close. Then it did the strange thing asked of it and opened a way for a voice to come through a throat that did not exist.\n\nThe apology did not arrive with grammar. It arrived with heat and with the memory of a gasket, with a sigh that contained graphite, with a pop the room had always forgiven until it had decided not to. You could smell a line of sweetness pushed too far against a red wall. You could hear the scrape of a broom and then the broom being leaned against the wrong pillar. There was a song none of them knew and all of them recognized, the tune men hum when numbers climb to meet their palms. It was not language, and it was comprehension.\n\nEzra\u2019s eyes stung and he told his nose this was not the moment to call him sensitive. Lyra pressed her palm to the iron and pressed back hard, as if reminding the room that bodies are also thresholds that must be considered. Vessa whispered something under her breath that sounded like sorry and not like defeat; she had been the sort of girl who would not permit herself the unevenness of contrition, and you could hear the mature correction in the way she said it now. The mirror women did not catch the apology in their panes in the way you might have hoped; the apology refused to be framed and in that refusal was its veracity.\n\nMarin felt the moment the words had enough shape to be named. She did not translate. Translation is often the polite version of theft. She listened like the bay listens when foghorns talk to each other: with patience that is not infinite, with courtesy that is not naive. When the machine finally found its own small grammar and said enough-no-more-so-sorry in a sequence of sighs and clicks, Marin said yes in a tone that authorized closure without conferring absolution. This is the balance some jobs require, and no one tells you how to get the weight right until you get it wrong in public.\n\nThen the strangest thing happened, which is how she knew it would stick for at least a season. The sweetness lifted from the jar and leaned, not to be dramatic, not with hunger, but to spread itself thin as if to be used properly for the first time since the last jar had been licked clean at a picnic. It laid an edge of itself along the seam of the boiler door, and the metal did not flinch; you can teach iron to like butter if you do it slowly and stop pretending iron and butter cannot be friends. The smell tilted around them and ducked, embarrassed to be observed. The jar cooled the way a teacup cools when you stop asking it to be the center of a conversation.\n\n\u201cThat will do,\u201d the courier said, and this time she did sigh, not because anyone had earned her relief but because bodies insist on their own rules. \u201cNow you will keep it simple. That is your punishment and your prize. Do not turn this into a monument. Do not make speeches until speeches are needed. You will come back once a week with oil and rags and a pail with water that has met mint. You will press your hands to the iron and tell it, I remember. If you cannot do that, all this is a kindness wasted.\u201d\n\nThey did not put a ribbon on the boiler. They did not take a photograph. They stood in a circle stupid with thin triumph and sudden hunger, the kind you only feel after a day you did not know had been practicing to break you. Outside the rain lightened like a mood corrected by a snack. The refinery exhaled and the birds complimented it by not leaving. Through a broken window across the yard, a scrap of paper moved and settled, and if anyone had thought to read it, it would have been an inventory so old it had stopped believing in the things it listed.\n\nBack at the Halfhouse, the circle in the jar had become dull as dried marmalade; this is an insult only to people who confuse shine with purpose. Lyra set the bowl of dirt down and kissed her thumb as if finishing a devout chore. Vessa put her pin back on her throat because shoes are for travel and throats are for arguments, and she had decided to enjoy both in their turn. The mirror women declared, without moving their mouths very much, that the museum glass would be allowed to look at children again tomorrow if no more handprints appeared in footage that had not appointed itself author. Leif did not give a speech, which, for Leif, was a speech.\n\nThey ate the last of the cookies, which is to say Vessa ate one and did not bother to disguise the look of private satisfaction that hovered over her mouth after a salt crystal dissolved, and Ezra took the largest one because martyrdom is a silly habit he tried to keep from getting worse by rewarding it, and Lyra broke hers in half and tucked a piece into the pot of rosemary like a promise. Marin ticked salt into the window tracks in her head because she had not been home to do it and because the city respects plans you make aloud even if they are metaphors.\n\nThe princess of Mire rose when they rose and walked toward the door the Halfhouse had selected as an exit. She paused in the threshold like a woman remembering a name she had been told to stop using when she hit adolescence. She looked back at the jar and at the table and at Marin and then at Ezra and then at the courier and then at the cadres of people with opinions. She did not look at Leif, which was, in its way, a gift.\n\n\u201cThey will start telling a nicer story about me,\u201d she said, and the humor in her voice had a scar on it. \u201cThey will become sentimental, and sentiment is just cruelty with a ribbon. Do not let them. If you hear a child repeat a version of me that makes her the moral for the benefit of a sister, correct with a joke. If you hear a woman invoke me to excuse a damp carpet, correct with a recipe. If you smell me where you do not expect me, draw breath and then ask if you are near a machine that has been waiting to apologize.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will,\u201d Marin said, and she meant it; she felt in her teeth the decision to be irritating for the sake of preventing a lie from becoming comfortable. \u201cCome by the shop if someone throws you out of a meeting. We have chairs no one respects enough to be afraid of, and we have paperbacks we won\u2019t care if you fail to return.\u201d\n\nThe princess\u2019s smile was as private as a mirror turned face-down. \u201cI may,\u201d she said, and she owed no one a better promise than that. \u201cAnd when I do I will buy the book with the woman who eats flowers because no one told her she could eat meat.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe refunds nothing,\u201d Ezra said quickly, because reflex is sometimes love in a hurry. \u201cBut I will hide the good pens.\u201d\n\n\u201cHide nothing,\u201d the princess said, and without warning she leaned close enough that Marin could see the exact place a scratch had scarred her bottom lip when she was small and someone punished a laugh for being too loud. \u201cIf they find what you hide they will decide to be generous about something they should have been thoughtful about. Leave your pens where hands can reach. Teach them to ask.\u201d\n\nWhen she was gone the room became, for a breath, ordinary in the way an emptied church is ordinary: wood and air and the suggestion of knees. Marin felt an ache in the places of her body that thresholds prefer to mark, the ankle and the jaw and the soft under the ribs, and decided to treat herself the way she treats pipes; she would flatter her bones into cooperating. She gathered her bag and the map, which had softened because it liked being consulted, and the letter, which had decided to stop sulking and reclaim its habit of making itself heavier when ignored. Ezra took the empty pastry box and the rag and declared he would take the rag home and wash it and return it, a vow that made Vessa widen her eyes in theatrical awe at his bold commitment to domesticity.\n\nThe city, as a reward for the apology that had been made in a language it understood even if it would never call it that, let the clouds tear themselves into strips so that the sun could play at releasing scenes it had had in storage. On the walk back up the hill a man practiced saxophone in a doorway and his notes weren\u2019t sure whether they preferred the minor or the major, which is what a life is like when it has not yet been pinned down by rent. A woman hauled two grocery bags past them with arms that could have lifted the elevator in Marin\u2019s building if she had been asked to, and she nodded at them like people nod at a weather change they have chosen not to shout at. A bus knelt for a stranger and then broke up the kneel with an embarrassed cough. When they passed under the viaduct\u2019s absence the air moved with relief or ghost memory; it is impossible to tell the two apart unless you are a city and can afford to be wrong in public.\n\nSel was unimpressed by apologies and ritual and men with narrow shoulders pretending to be building managers at gates. She sniffed Marin\u2019s ankles and sneezed and then demanded a piece of the last cookie, and when Ezra tore her a sugared corner she accepted it with the hauteur of queens who have trained courtiers not to offer twice. The shop, in their absence, had rearranged no one, which is the best you can hope for when you stop minding something for an afternoon. The bell over the door made a series of questioning notes and then forgave them for not answering it with a poem.\n\n\u201cDo we put a sign in the window that says \u2018Apology Accepted,\u2019\u201d Ezra asked while he pried at the staples on a box so he could flatten it properly. \u201cOr do we call it \u2018Apology Noted\u2019 so we can reserve judgment when the factory tries to become a gentrified haunted house with a tasting room.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe put a sign that says \u2018Now Hiring: Honest Regret,\u2019\u201d Marin said, and she took down the sticky note on the register that said Must Remember to Call Trash Company and turned it over to write on it so it wouldn\u2019t feel it had failed. \u201cResponsibilities include: not pretending you are a hero when you are simply a machine. Benefits: fewer head colds.\u201d\n\nThey opened for an hour because it made them feel like they were not saving the world, which is a burden best refused unless you are a god with a sense of humor. An old man with an umbrella that smelled aggressively like a cupboard bought an almanac from 1998 because he wanted to remember the dates of rains that had not kept their promises since. A couple ordered the same book at the same time and then laughed and pretended they had not been surprised by the coincidence; Marin wrapped the books without commenting because some punches never land as sweetly if called. A girl with glitter nail polish bought a field guide to ferns and a romance with a woman on the cover who could have been her grandmother; she slid her last two crumpled dollars across the counter and said keep the change, which was five cents, and Ezra took the coins and said he would.\n\nIt was both a quiet night and not. South, near the old factory, windows made the sound windows make when they decide there\u2019s no point in rattling policy into patience anymore. West, over the bay, the ferry horns tried out new jokes on the fog and the fog refused politely and laughed later in private. Under the city, in the culvert, the mouths stayed extra awake and practiced saying the names of people as if they were allowed to love them without being punished. In the Halfhouse the jar slept like any animal that has been told it will be asked to be good tomorrow. Upstairs, in Marin\u2019s apartment, the rosemary kept its counsel and then offered it at midnight to a room that had not asked.\n\nShe did not expect to cry when she washed her face, and she did not. She did not expect to pray, and she did not. She stood at the window and watched the blue neon down the block blink with less neurosis and felt the way her chest made room for this ragged, small victory. She wrote three sentences on a postcard she would not send to anyone\u2014the addressee has a habit of abandoning his address\u2014and set it under the jar she used for pens so that it could teach the pens to be braver. She let the city put her to bed because sometimes she can admit without drama that the streets hold her better than a person might.\n\nThe instructions the letter gave in the morning were simple enough to irritate her. Hold the room. Open the door. Listen when the glass says it would like to be useful. Teach the children that guilt is not a spice you can stir into a cake to make it rise. Bring sugar only when you mean to remedy bitterness. Do not excuse incense. Use soap made of the kind of oil grandmothers love. When it began to list recipes she laughed aloud and the sound made her kettle believe it had been included in something important.\n\nAt the Halfhouse the council arrived with their chairs and their grudges weeping little salt droplets at the corners. Vessa had brought a ledger and a pencil and had tied her hair back with string the color of forgiveness in a picture book. The mirror women had polished nothing, which was how you knew they were determined. Lyra\u2019s apron had been mended in two new places and her hands refused to be anything but honest. Leif had come with a man whose face had never quite finished choosing whether to be handsome or kind; he wore a jacket that had used to belong to someone who spoke under the boilers when he thought the steam was listening. The courier had a smear of dirt on her cheekbone that made Ezra think of women who fall asleep in trains and fold their bodies around packages the way cats curl their tails.\n\n\u201cSomeone has been telling a new story in the market,\u201d Vessa said without preamble, and in her voice was the brittle good mood of a woman who would prefer not to know the answer to the question she is asking. \u201cIt is about a princess who smelled so bad she made all the boys cry, and the moral is that you have to wash until you are liked or the city will spit you out. I don\u2019t intend to arrest children for repeating it. I do intend to ask whose grandmother or uncle taught them, because that\u2019s where infections start.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s coming with the fish,\u201d Lyra said, and the disgust in her mouth was almost a compliment to the fishmongers\u2019 skill. \u201cTourists repeat what the men shout. Some of the men are old enough to know better. Some are young enough to think they invented bravado. I will bring them rosemary and speak as if I am a sailor in their language and see if they blush.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe glass has behaved all morning,\u201d said the mirror woman with blade hair, and her neutrality was almost a kindness to the room. \u201cWe have asked it to practice reflecting clouds and teenagers learning to regard their faces as arguments instead of insults. It excelled. One of our sisters refuses to take off her scarf because she believes the refinery wants her hair. We have given her cinnamon sticks for her pocket. It is possible the refinery wants everything. We are capable of the word no.\u201d\n\nLeif\u2019s guest cleared his throat like a bench deciding it can support one more person after all. He set his hand flat on the table and looked at no one in particular as he said, \u201cI was there the day they shut it. I took a oval tin of cough drops from a locker and never owned another piece of that place. I think about the time we pitched in to buy someone a cake when his child graduated because you\u2019re supposed to do that when families accomplish things as if they are not the field team of coincidence. I don\u2019t care about your jars or your ladies in the wall or the way the floor makes me feel like I\u2019m standing on a piano key, but I can help you keep the apology from getting cheap. Don\u2019t let them take pictures. Don\u2019t let them talk over the machines when the machines try to speak again. Don\u2019t let sugar become charity. I have a shirt that still smells like caramel after three decades. I\u2019ll bring it here so we can remind the room why it\u2019s learning to tolerate sweetness.\u201d\n\nMarin watched a faint light look for his shoulders to sit on. It found them. It looked no more dramatic than putting on a jacket and also changed the weather around his head by one degree. She wanted to thank him and did not because this would have made him a statue in a life that had not forgiven him for needing statues. She opened the map that was not yet pretending to be a map and smoothed its corners, and when her palm ran across the ink she felt the tug of five other rooms waiting their turn. The city had a list; the city always has a list; each item would become a story if they let it, and stories become jobs when people are tired.\n\nSomeone had to mention the market boys and the new version of the princess. Someone had to suggest a counter-story. Someone had to say, in a reasonable tone, that making a good story cheap is the way you win elections and lose your soul. The older woman with the portrait hair suggested fliers tucked into bouquets: recipes for cleaning perfumes out of curtains and the names of women who had lived their lives without granting anyone the rights to their smells. Lyra offered to barter fern starts for a promise not to chant rhymes about girls into the backs of tourists\u2019 heads. Ezra volunteered to fold pamphlets because his hands were built for making paper behave. Vessa said she would walk the market and glare at the loud and flirt with the loud if that would help, because some women do not believe in letting men decide what counts as a tool.\n\nThey were still arguing about whether children should be bribed with licorice or kindness when the Halfhouse did the thing it had not done in months: it rang. It rang like a bell that had been stolen from a church that never existed and then recovered with a dramatic note pinned to its clapper. The sound trembled wood and nerve; the floor leaned into the rhythm like a room remembering dance in a century that had outlawed it twice. The mirror women put their hands to their hair out of instinct. Leif froze and then arranged his face into leadership. The courier\u2019s mouth did not move, which is how Marin knew they were about to perform for an audience that had been in town a long time without being seen.\n\nThe door did not open because the Halfhouse would never be so obvious. The air in the middle of the room learned to pretend it was a threshold and then became one out of embarrassment. Through it walked one person everyone knew and one person no one did. The first was the mayor, which is to say a woman whose job was to convince a city it could be treated like a person for four-year intervals; she had rain on her collar and a smile that was tired and too bright but still hers. The second was small and old and wore an orange knit hat and a coat that had been one coat until time inserted another and they had learned to share a zipper. The old woman carried something wrapped in a towel, and when she set it on the table you could feel a room demean itself by leaning forward.\n\n\u201cThis belonged to my mother,\u201d the old woman said when no one had yet asked, because she was not interested in being made to answer questions in an order that suited the egos of committees. \u201cShe stole it from a shelf in the office when they were supposed to be afraid of the supervisor. He was a small man with clean hands. He would have married me if I had wanted that. I did not. I liked the way the kettle sounded without him. Inside is the name you wouldn\u2019t say. I brought it because the water in my building kept smelling like a sick pantry and nobody downstairs believes me when I call.\u201d\n\nShe unfolded the towel and lifted a ledger bound in cracked blue cloth. The room took a breath in the way it had been taught by people who think rooms cannot possibly mind manners. The book had an authority only objects earn when they have absorbed years of breath and ink and the hot breath of men who have bragged and the cool breath of women who have said their daughters\u2019 names over lists. Marin touched the cover and felt the pop of a dozen broken belts and a funeral that had been postponed twice and then cancelled because the man was not dead at all but living in a hotel in Tacoma with a woman who asked fewer questions. The ledger smelled like sugar if sugar had been read to sleep.\n\nThe mayor, to her credit, saw the jar and did not pretend she had arrived for any reason other than the smell and the letter on Marin\u2019s table in her office. She had the neat expression of a woman who denies herself fear for the good of the committee and then allows herself three seconds of panic in an elevator between floors. She nodded to the jar, to the rosemary, to Vessa\u2019s pin and Lyra\u2019s dirt, to the mirror women like a name-dropping friend confiding she\u2019d always loved glass in summer. Then her eyes found the princess of Mire, who had not stood when the bell rang, and the mayor\u2019s smile changed into something that was not for cameras.\n\n\u201cI used to be the girl who always smelled like pool water,\u201d she said, and you could hear Seattle in the pitch of her vowels, the way this city says sorry with sarcasm because apology is a coat it wears only to church. \u201cMy mother put lemon in my hair and the teacher moved my desk. I am extraordinarily grateful you came to a meeting I did not call.\u201d\n\nThe princess lifted her chin the way a person does who refuses to see flattery as anything but architecture. \u201cDon\u2019t do the thing,\u201d she said pleasantly, and the whole room felt the mercy of her tone. \u201cDon\u2019t connect your childhood to mine for free. You may connect it later, if you work. Now sit. Your knees sound like someone else\u2019s weather. You can add it to your next speech.\u201d\n\nThe mayor sat. The old woman opened the ledger and turned, with the slow correctness of a librarian who has coached her grief into the shape of tidiness, to a page where a sugar stain had curled the paper into a coastline. There, in black ink that had learned how to turn blue with time, was the name no one wanted said aloud. It looked harmless in cursive. It looked like any other noise we have taught to sit like a dog. Marin did not say it. The princess of Mire did not say it. The courier, of all people, said it under her breath with the poise of a person who uses proper nouns like hammers and not cups.\n\nThe Halfhouse did not flinch. Perhaps it did, and then made a decision to lie convincingly. The jar did not flare. The smell tried, faintly, to show off and then remembered that rooms like this burn show-offs for warmth and learned to be shy. The name stirred the ledger and the ledger stirred the room and the room moved a hair toward a kind of future that would make nothing of a spin and a belt and a woman carrying a towel.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d Vessa said, and her pencil hovered over backlash as if out of obedience to an old craft. \u201cNow that we have a proper noun and a bookribbon of regret on the map, we can do a thing that men will mistake for a party and then be alarmed by when it becomes a community. We will take apologies to the places that need them. We will stop asking the city to carry them home. We will teach the smell to stay in the jar unless it is invited to go to work. We will not purchase incense, and if anyone offers me a sachet I will put it under my heel.\u201d\n\nEzra passed the rag to the old woman because he had the sudden, ridiculous thought that she had been promised something soft by no one for a long time, and she took it like a woman who knows softness is often a code. Marin asked the ledger if it would like to come home with her and felt it consider the bookstore shelves the way a dog considers the lap of a person who never learned where the lap begins and ends. Lyra invited the mayor to touch the rosemary; the mayor did, and the plant softened because women who kiss their daughters on the head when they smell like chlorine are powerful. The mirror women tilted their own faces down to look like ordinary people for three lovely seconds.\n\nThey had, before the jar, before the refinery, before the culvert, agreed to the Summit because it had sounded like a word that might persuade bad people to dress well. After, they knew it would be a family argument with dirt and knives and cookies and the frightening possibility of new rules. Marin felt the letter in her pocket spin a syllable like a coin on a bar. She thought of the boys at the market and their rhymes. She thought of the boiler that had learned to be ashamed without being destroyed by it. She thought of the smell that had not obeyed and the sweetness that had nurtured itself into something useful. She wondered whether she would be the person to hold the room together or the one who had to leave halfway through to take a call from a drain that had decided to be a garden.\n\nOn the way out to find lunch that would not taste like work, Ezra pulled his scarf up against a wind that had decided to put on its spring personality early and said, as if remarking on peaches, \u201cThey will want to put the jar in a museum.\u201d\n\nMarin pictured a plinth and a plaque and a child who would learn to press his face too close to the glass to see if there was a reflection hidden in the sweetness. She pictured a docent explaining what rot is using a PowerPoint that had been designed by a bored man in a beige building. She pictured a teacher reminding students not to use their mouths unless calling on. She pictured the smell practicing tricks for twelve-year-olds and being rewarded with applause like a dog that would prefer to be a wolf.\n\n\u201cWe will not let them,\u201d she said, and she took his hand to stop the sentence from going any further out into the rain. \u201cIt\u2019s a jar. It\u2019s a job. We have had enough of altars to our own competence. If we must admire something, let it be a wrench.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet it be your ankles,\u201d he said without thinking, and then he flushed because sometimes he outwits his own mouth and loses graciously, and she laughed properly for the first time since the culvert, a tearless, bellied sound that made a woman across the street in a coat the color of ponds look up and grin for the whole city.\n\nThey walked into a day that had become the kind you do not need to please because it has decided to please you by accident. The two gulls who had been waiting at the rail the day this started were on duty again, their black eyes soft with the satisfaction of birds who enjoy a front-row seat at a human error. They shifted politely to make room for an old man in a cap that carried the name of a ship he had crewed in his sentiment. The ferry exhaled and held still. The pipes beneath their feet were not quiet and would not be, and no one in that room or any other would succeed in silencing them for long, and this, Marin thought, was the point and the prize and the best argument she had for complicating her life this way until someone told her to stop.",

                              "content": "The day the gulls lined the rail like judges, the sky over Elliott Bay hung low and textured, a ceiling of gray wool threaded with hints of blue. Seattle has moods. On that morning it was taking deep breaths and thinking of rain. Marin Gray watched the ferry lumber across the water, watched its white hull carve a wake that folded in on itself, watched her reflection stall in the glass of the market window then flicker back into a stranger\u2019s.\n\nHer father always said the city had a pulse you could find if you put your hand to the right pipe. In their old house\u2014before the house itself slipped into that other, adjacent country where the Tidelands begin\u2014Marin would lay her ear to the basement wall and listen to the faint thrum of water under concrete. She could still find it, the beat and counter-beat, when she stood at the edge of the pier and breathed with the sound. Did people notice, the little tilt of the tide when she whispered? Sometimes she thought the bay leaned closer to hear her.\n\nShe adjusted her scarf, a blue so deep it might have been dipped in twilight, and headed past the fishmongers. They were throwing salmon at each other simply because they could, performing for the visitors and for themselves. The air was sharp with iced fish, espresso, flowers two days into wilting. A tourist squealed when a fish turned midair like a silver switchblade. Marin smiled and let the sound pass through her, a tide itself.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late, princess,\u201d Ezra said when she reached the bookstore.\n\nHe always said princess in the way Seattle says things it half-believes: a joke with a long shadow. Ezra had hair that couldn\u2019t decide which direction to go and a chin a sculptor might have argued with. He tossed her the ring of keys. \u201cWe\u2019ve already had three requests for that out-of-print tide guide, can you imagine. People feel very spiritual about schedules.\u201d\n\n\u201cSchedules are their only religion,\u201d she said, and unlocked the door.\n\nThey worked in a room that smelled like paper and dust and the secondhand ink of other people's notes. The bookstore, which insisted on calling itself Perigee & Apogee as if the moon had cut a ribbon at its opening, creaked when anyone walked too assertively. Bookcases leaned. A cat named Sel fed herself on the fish smell drifting up the hill when demonstrations bored her.\n\nMarin loved it. Loved the way used books carried the warm, humid memory of someone else\u2019s summer. Loved the way Ezra could recite entire paragraphs from flawed memoirs with a straight face. Loved stepping outside to take the trash down on the slick boards behind the shop and feeling the water\u2019s nearness, like a cousin showing up uninvited.\n\n\u201cWant a coffee?\u201d Ezra asked midmorning, peering at her over a stack of travelogues. \u201cYou\u2019re doing that thing with your fingers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cCounting, like an itinerant mathematician. Coffee?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\n\nShe counted without meaning to when the barometer inside her shifted. One, two, three. A gull heart-beating. Four, five. The ferry docking. On six a vein of cold ran down the back of her neck and made her teeth ache. Rain was thinking about falling. She felt it the way a fisherman feels a bite before the line goes taut.\n\nEzra came back with the coffee he only pretended to mess up. He slid it over the counter with a flourish, then leaned in. \u201cSo. What\u2019s new in the palace?\u201d\n\nShe laughed. \u201cOh you know. From the porch of our two-bedroom palace with the rattling windows, I extend clemency to the pigeon that refuses to leave the fire escape and command it to poop only on the neighbor\u2019s side.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour rule is merciful and wise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about you? How\u2019s your campaign to not text your ex after midnight?\u201d\n\n\u201cViciously effective. I only thought about it. Twice.\u201d\n\nThey bantered. The hours leaned into one another. People came in to ask for old maps and novels about ageless things. Noon melted into afternoon. At some point a foghorn bellowed from the bay, low and insistently mournful. A tug\u2019s voice. A foghorn is a throat with steel in it but Marin had sometimes thought she could hear words if she stood at the right angle. She looked up. The windows trembled like water.\n\nThe bell over the door rang at two. It rang and then didn\u2019t, because someone had stepped inside without making it ring. That happens sometimes when wind sneaks in with a guest, but the air didn\u2019t move. Marin felt it, a notch of absence, the precise subtraction of sound and smell. Even Sel sat up as if something had rearranged the furniture inside the world.\n\nThe woman who stood by the travelogues had rain on her coat that didn\u2019t look like rain. Not Seattle rain, not the casual spatter of a shower that barely bothers your hair. This rain was thin and metallic, like a condensate scraped off an antique clock, silver on her sleeve and beaded on her hood. She took the hood down. Black hair, blunt. Skin the color of the underside of a cloud at dawn. Eyes that made the light hesitate.\n\nEzra opened his mouth to say hello. She lifted a hand and the hello fell out of him onto the floor and broke.\n\n\u201cMarin Gray,\u201d she said, and there was an accent in the way she slipped around the syllables. Old. Slightly salt. \u201cYour Highness.\u201d\n\nEzra\u2019s eyes went from Marin to the woman and back again, a cat\u2019s eyes following the idea of a laser pointer.\n\n\u201cNot here,\u201d Marin said. Her voice came out softer than she intended.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the woman said. \u201cHere. Because here is where you insist on living. You were told to keep moving and yet. You planted your feet in a city built on water and pretend you can\u2019t be found when anyone with a map and a nose could trace your steps. The coffee, the bay, the bridges. All your favorite things smell like you.\u201d\n\nSel hissed at her and then pretended she had not.\n\nMarin did not look at Ezra. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cCourier.\u201d The woman fished in the inside pocket of her coat and brought out an envelope that was not an envelope until she set it on the counter. On the way down it was a smear of light, then a folded thing that might have been paper once and was now paper again. A seal held it closed, stamped with a spiral coil that made Marin\u2019s stomach twist. \u201cFrom the Concord.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m busy,\u201d Marin said without moving her hands from the counter. \u201cWe\u2019re reorganizing the geography section, as you can see.\u201d\n\nEzra found his voice. \u201cMarin, do you\u2014should I give you two some privacy? Or should I\u2014what is this? Who\u2014are you dangerous?\u201d He said the last word like it might be a flavor.\n\nThe courier took in the shop, the leaning bookcase with its listing titles, the stacks of magazines about boats that wanted to be boats more than read about them. \u201cTell your friend to take his break.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take my break,\u201d Ezra said automatically, and he was gone through the curtain into the little kitchen where Sel never went because the linoleum unnerved her. Silence in the front of the shop like a pressure change ahead of a storm.\n\nMarin looked at the envelope. It smelled faintly of rosemary and wet iron. And something else. Something like the place where a stream runs under a slaughterhouse. She swallowed.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have found me,\u201d she said, and it sounded petulant, which she hated. \u201cI wasn\u2019t\u2014do they send couriers now? What happens to messengers who step onto this side with seals in their pockets?\u201d\n\nThe courier smiled without showing teeth. \u201cThey go home if they go quickly. They stay if they dawdle. I do not dawdle.\u201d\n\nMarin wiped her hands on her jeans. Her fingers were colder than the counter. \u201cWho sent it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Concord.\u201d The woman tipped her chin at the seal. \u201cOpen it. It\u2019s for you. It asked to be warmed by your hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know how it works.\u201d Marin picked it up. It made a sound like a sigh and something else; like the rustle of cedar boughs in a dream you wouldn\u2019t admit to having. She ran a thumb along the seal, which parted. Inside: thick paper that held the memory of the tree it had been. Ink that had dried in stages, as if the message had been written by several hands all at once.\n\nLittle places you can\u2019t avoid. She had missed them and not missed them at all.\n\nHighness, the first line said, and then her name spelled as it is not ever spelled on driver\u2019s licenses or prescriptions. What came after was like stepping on a stone you believed steady and finding it turn under your foot. The letter mentioned the Confluence in autumn and the words \u201cnecessary\u201d and \u201conly.\u201d It mentioned an event of a nature both predictable and entirely new. It mentioned thresholds, coupons of luck unused and now expired, tides that had reversed their instructions. It mentioned the smell.\n\nYou will have noticed the smell, it said, almost sympathetic.\n\nShe had. Over the last month the city had acquired a second scent at dawn. It was not the warm, sour dough of bread or the freeway\u2019s hot breath or the early morning romance of jet fuel. It was not the sharp green of the market stalls or the sweet rot that rose from the compost bins when someone forgot the lid. This new smell slid in under all of that and laced it together with a stitch you couldn\u2019t quite see.\n\nThe smell of something left in the sun too long and then taken inside and pretended normal. The smell of damp carpet in a house that has been shut up for years. Or of seaweed dragged too far upshore and left to curl. It made waiters frown and wave their hands under their noses and ask strangers if they could smell gas. It made Marin wake up at three a.m. with the taste of metal coins in her mouth.\n\nThe letter did not write the name the smell belonged to, but it didn\u2019t have to. Marin had been a girl in halls that hummed when you said that name. Old books had been wrapped in waxed cloth so that the mere mention of it would not be soaked up by their spines and carried forward to frighten another reader. Don\u2019t say it, her father said. Don\u2019t write it, your ink will turn back and spit the word in your face.\n\nThe courier watched her read to the end. Marin kept her face still. She folded the letter. It unfolded itself. She folded it again harder. It sighed and lay down like a cat who has decided not to get up after all.\n\n\u201cWhat do they want.\u201d Not even a question. An accusation.\n\n\u201cYou.\u201d The courier\u2019s smile went away. \u201cThere is a matter with the Concord that concerns the better part of four realms. The one you claim and the one that shares its shoreline with this city, the one under that, and the one that touches all the above through mirrors and windows. There will be a meeting. You\u2019ll receive instructions. And then you will do as you are asked because you were named and the naming was witnessed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pretend,\u201d the courier said, and for a moment the word lost its modern coat. It was the older pretend: to make-present, to bring into the room. \u201cDo not pretend you do not know what your father was. Do not pretend you didn\u2019t swear by the shell and the salt. Do not pretend this city isn\u2019t your bolt-hole and your refuge and your leash. The Concord does not ask lightly. We have other options when we wish to be rude.\u201d\n\nMarin felt small and old. She felt like someone else\u2019s daughter. The shop around them creaked, heat rising in the pipes. The ferry let out another low call that sent the hair on her arms up. Was the water closer now than the street said it should be? She could never tell.\n\n\u201cWhat if I refuse?\u201d\n\nThe courier\u2019s eyebrows made the smallest movement. \u201cWhy ask questions you have already answered.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet you have.\u201d\n\nEzra appeared at the curtain, hand frozen in the act of pushing it aside. He looked at the courier and then at Marin and then at the letter that had once been not-paper and would be not-paper again if it went where it wanted. \u201cHey. So. Are we okay? Is this about taxes?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about tides,\u201d Marin said without looking at him. \u201cIt\u2019s about invitations I didn\u2019t ask for.\u201d\n\nThe courier had already turned toward the door. She didn\u2019t touch it. The door opened, obedient. She paused with her hand on the air, like someone might pause on a bannister.\n\n\u201cYou will feel the instructions as much as receive them,\u201d she said, not quite to Marin, not quite to the threshold. \u201cYou will understand them not long after you stop wishing you didn\u2019t. Prepare your friend to be left.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not leaving,\u201d Marin said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll leave,\u201d the woman said.\n\n\u201cAnd you? Do you leave?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways. Before it starts to smell.\u201d\n\nThe door closed. The bell rang, belated. The air added itself back to the room in increments, like someone reopening a fist. Ezra took a breath so sharp Sel glanced up and glared at him for disturbing her nap.\n\n\u201cYou. Are. The. Actual. Princess.\u201d Ezra said it slowly, as if he\u2019d decided to become the punctuation he needed. \u201cYou are the princess of\u2014of\u2014what? The Seattle Aquarium?\u201d\n\nMarin closed her eyes. When she opened them the letter still lay on the counter, impossible not to see. She reached out and slid it back into the envelope that went heavier in her hand the way a stone does when it decides it\u2019s tired of being thrown. The wax seal had remade itself. It made a soft chuff when she ran her thumb across it, like a seal. She almost laughed at that and then did not.\n\n\u201cOf a place that touches this place,\u201d she said. \u201cOf the water that holds this city like a hand around a bowl. It\u2019s complicated and also not. And you promised once never to ask me to explain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that promise was about this.\u201d Ezra came around the counter the way you approach a cat on the sidewalk: not too fast. \u201cWho was she? The woman. Don\u2019t say courier, that\u2019s not a name.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople like that don\u2019t give names. It tangles them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said people. Is she\u2014like you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWorse,\u201d Marin said, which wasn\u2019t an answer.\n\nThey closed the shop early because Ezra refused not to stand with her even if he did not know where she needed standing. They walked down to the edge of the pier and leaned against the metal railing that had been painted and repainted so many times it had its own topography. The water was a pane of sleeping stone. A squirrel said something profane to a child. A man in a high-vis jacket checked the bolts on something with the reverence of a priest.\n\nMarin didn\u2019t open the envelope because she knew what it would do. She cupped her coffee in both hands and watched the white ferry pass and the black gulls turn into commas against the sky and then back into birds.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you because it sounds like lying,\u201d she said eventually. \u201cSaying \u2018I\u2019m a princess\u2019 here is like saying you\u2019re a wizard or a tax break. Ridiculous by default. And it doesn\u2019t help. It doesn\u2019t give you health insurance. It doesn\u2019t make landlords nicer.\u201d\n\nEzra\u2019s voice was careful. \u201cSo you are one. For real real.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor real real.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you left. Or you were\u2014what? Exiled? Do we say exiled? That sounds very cloak-and-dagger.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of that. Just. I didn\u2019t like the way the rooms made my lungs feel. I didn\u2019t like the way people said my name like it was something you could take a bite out of. I wanted to hear traffic. I wanted to be anonymous and watch the clouds throw themselves at the city and dissolve.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they let you go.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t prisoners.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why does it feel like she came to arrest you?\u201d\n\nMarin didn\u2019t have a neat answer and so did not try to make one. She reached up and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and the wind put it back in her face. The air across the bay shifted. You could taste the change on your tongue if you had that kind of mouth. She did. It tasted like\u2014she frowned. Like something trying very hard to masquerade as something else. Like\u2014no. It was not. It couldn\u2019t be here, not already, not\u2014\n\n\u201cDo you smell that?\u201d she asked.\n\nEzra sniffed. \u201cSea. Diesel. Pretzels. Me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, the other.\u201d\n\nHe breathed in again, exaggerated. His expression went from puzzled to amused to something Marin had never seen on him before. A little twist at the corner of his mouth that was not humor. \u201cOh,\u201d he said. \u201cGod. What is that. That\u2019s\u2014did a museum spill?\u201d\n\nIt was coming up from the south, that smell. The water seemed to carry it delicate at first, then like a dare. It coiled through the pylons and under the boards and made the seals in the harbor turn their whiskers toward it and then away. Marin\u2019s stomach did the thing stomachs do when you\u2019re about to be ill and also the thing they do on a rollercoaster. Two different instructions at once.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she lied. The letter in her pocket warmed like a coin in a palm that wants to spend it.\n\n\u201cYou told a lie you don\u2019t practice enough for,\u201d Ezra said.\n\nThe wind shifted again and it was gone or it was everywhere. Someone behind them sneezed and cursed.\n\n\u201cCome with me,\u201d Marin said, surprising both of them. \u201cThere\u2019s a place.\u201d\n\n\u201cA palace? A dungeon? A trapdoor?\u201d\n\n\u201cA plant shop in Pioneer Square. The owner owes me a favor.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously,\u201d Ezra said. \u201cThe princess of the water below the coffee capital goes to collect a favor in a plant shop. This is either a fable or an indie film.\u201d\n\nThey went up the hill and through an alley that nobody old enough to be wise walked down alone, and into the green-tinted sanctuary where the air was humid and busy with the respiration of leaves. Plants stood in clusters like gossiping girls; a fern arched over a shelf and tickled the ceramic mug below it as if it wanted to drink what the humans drink. The owner was there, covered in dirt in the way that is essentially a uniform, and raised an eyebrow when she saw Marin with an extra person in tow.\n\n\u201cPrincess,\u201d she said. Not teasing. Not bowing. Simply naming. \u201cYour timing is either awful or perfect. Did you bring me cuttings\u2014no, you brought a man. That\u2019s more work.\u201d\n\n\u201cLyra,\u201d Marin said, relieved. \u201cI need a door. Not all the way open. Just\u2014just a crack, to hear through.\u201d\n\nLyra\u2019s hands, wiped on her apron, were the kind of hands that knew when a pot was going to crack just by looking at the weather. She looked at Ezra like someone assessing a tool and then at Marin and then at the perspiring leaves that wanted everything to have a little more water, a little less. She nodded once and pushed a flat of succulents aside with a toe. Below the table, moss had been coaxed to carpet the concrete so thoroughly that it looked like green felt. Lyra knelt and knocked on a spot that to anyone else would have been an ordinary spot. To Marin it was an old friend\u2019s shoulder.\n\nThe knock was three beats in a rhythm that the city echoes if you stand under the Aurora Bridge at midnight and listen to tires on metal. The moss darkened. Then it parted.\n\nEzra made a noise he had always imagined he would never make. He reached out like a child on so many first days of school. Marin touched his wrist and he pulled his hand back quickly.\n\n\u201cStep here,\u201d Lyra said. \u201cWithout thinking about it too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhenever someone tells me not to think about something, I think about it intensely,\u201d Ezra said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can fix it now or later,\u201d Lyra said and looked at Marin. \u201cQuick.\u201d\n\nThey went down not so much into a place as along it, like sliding between threads. Marin felt the sudden change in light, the small pinch in her ears the way cabins do when you drive through mountain passes. She felt the brush of old things that have decided to keep their names. The air slid into her mouth sweet and cold and then almost sickening. Not because of what the place was, but because of what had reached it. The smell. It was here, too, diluted like poison in a lake but no less itself. A warning. A boast.\n\nOn the other side the corridor widened into a room that wasn\u2019t a room unless you liked your rooms nebulous and lit by the memory of weather. The walls suggested stone. The ceiling suggested a sky that somebody had been very careful to make just enough like a sky that no one would panic. There were chairs of the sort you sit in only if you remember to do it the old-fashioned way, with your back not in revolt. A table.\n\nMarin heard them before she saw them: a murmur like fish remembering to speak and then deciding it would be rude. Then faces. People she had seen her whole childhood until she left because to stay was to let everyone else\u2019s opinion of her calcify like a barnacle on a hull.\n\n\u201cHighness,\u201d said a man whose beard was a separate animal. \u201cYou came. How obliging.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeif,\u201d she said, and he flinched as if she had not the right to call him by his name. Perhaps she did not.\n\n\u201cAnd with a companion who reeks of coffee. The mortal.\u201d\n\n\u201cEzra,\u201d he said stiffly. \u201cOf Capitol Hill.\u201d\n\nA woman across the table smiled the way a knife smiles when it has just been sharpened. \u201cYou bring a boy into the Confluence. How droll. Do you intend to bring a whole band later?\u201d\n\n\u201cI intend to hear what you wanted,\u201d Marin said.\n\nThey told her what she had already read in the letter and more besides. They told her of reports from far harbors and near drains. Fish caught with lesions who smelled of compost. A bridge that sweated in the night with a slick that had no obvious source and offended a thousand noses when morning broke. Three seals found on a beach in a configuration that meant nothing to biologists and too much to anyone with a touch of old story in their blood. The smell turning up where it chose, regardless of wind.\n\n\u201cIt is deliberate,\u201d said Leif, tapping the table as if he could persuade it to agree. \u201cNot accident. Not decay as policy. The Rot is organizing itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call it that,\u201d someone at the back snarled. \u201cIt likes when you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does it like,\u201d Ezra said softly. \u201cDoes it like lamp shades?\u201d He hadn\u2019t meant to speak, Marin could hear that. She could also hear the trembling behind the humor, as if he had set a platespun on a rod and stood back.\n\nA girl on the left, sandy-haired and young enough to still show you what she thought before she could manage to hide it, leaned forward. \u201cIt is said\u2014if you will all stop chewing the old words for a moment\u2014it is said that a princess of Mire has returned. That she refuses to cover her impossible stench. That her odor is her weapon and her banner and the way she puts a foot in every house.\u201d\n\nMire. Marin tasted the syllable the old way and it tasted like turning over a rock and finding a thousand legs. It tasted like childhood dare games at edges where edges shouldn\u2019t be.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d said the knife-smile woman, and for a moment Marin wondered if the comment was to the girl\u2019s impertinence or to the saying of the place before there was permission to say it.\n\nThe room argued like a family around a holiday table. Deliberately forgetting to be decorous so that someone would remember on everyone\u2019s behalf and then be blamed for caring. There were proposals worth scraps of attention and proposals that sounded like someone had eaten a map and misread the legend. They all looked to Marin eventually, not young or old in that moment but simply necessary.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want me to do.\u201d She said it evenly and none of them could quite hide their relief at how she took the question as if it had been hers to begin with.\n\n\u201cThere will be a Summit,\u201d Leif said. \u201cCalled by us, but hosted where the four meet with minimal quarrel.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the Halfhouse,\u201d Lyra said. Marin hadn\u2019t seen her come through. Lyra stood near the door with soil on her knuckles, looks like the residue of any work a person could do that is not talk.\n\n\u201cYes. In the Halfhouse.\u201d Leif\u2019s beard flickered the way anything with hair says I disapprove. \u201cWe will speak with those who can speak for the other side. We will propose. We will barter. We will threaten to hold our breath and see who turns blue first. And you, Princess, will go\u2026forth.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo where.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere she is.\u201d\n\nShe. Pronouns older than swords, older than the first music. The room didn\u2019t breathe for a heartbeat. Ezra\u2019s hand found her elbow. She didn\u2019t know who he thought he could steady. Maybe himself.\n\n\u201cSend someone else,\u201d Marin said, and her voice landed with the dull surprise of something thrown in the wrong season. \u201cSend any of you. Send all of you. Send anyone who stayed to practice instead of leaving to lose the thread.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were named,\u201d the knife-smile woman said. \u201cThat is an answer. Why do you ask for another.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I am tired of being asked to be a machine,\u201d Marin said. It came out hard, harder than she meant. \u201cBecause this city fits me the way being a cog never did. Because I have a job that pays me in cash and in jokes and in the small good feeling of putting the right book in a stranger\u2019s hands. Because\u2014because.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all have small good feelings,\u201d Leif said, and he said it the way a man says it when he doesn\u2019t know this is a confession.\n\nLyra bent to examine a flaw in the table and said to the wood, which is to say to the room, which is to say to Marin: \u201cShe has to decide whether she\u2019ll answer. Don\u2019t make the decision into a trick. It will resist that and then you\u2019ll think magic failed you.\u201d\n\nMarin closed her eyes and saw nothing helpful. She saw the ferry. She saw Ezra\u2019s chipped mug in the sink because he insists it\u2019s his. She saw the gulls lined like punctuation on the rail. She saw her father\u2019s hands and the way they moved when he spoke of water as if it were a guest who could leave if it felt misunderstood.\n\nShe opened her eyes. The smell had crept under the door while they argued and was arranging itself in the corner like a guest who refuses to take off a wet coat. That was answer enough. She did not have to like it.\n\n\u201cWhen.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt dusk tomorrow, the summons will come proper,\u201d Leif said. \u201cYou will prepare and then you will go. I will give you maps.\u201d\n\n\u201cI bring my maps,\u201d Marin said.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d He couldn\u2019t help smiling at that. \u201cOf course you do.\u201d\n\nThe letter in her pocket whispered at her the way a bone on a string hitting a doorframe will whisper if the house wants you to hear it. She stood up. Ezra stood when she did because some habits stand on their own. Lyra put her hand, dirty, warm, on Marin\u2019s shoulder and squeezed once.\n\n\u201cTake a sprig,\u201d Lyra said, as if sending someone on a trip. \u201cOf something alive that remembers what sun tastes like.\u201d\n\nMarin reached blindly and her fingers found rosemary. She stripped a small strip and tucked it into the cuff of her sleeve so that its green spoke a private language against her skin.\n\nEzra touched the rosemary as if checking if it was real. He didn\u2019t ask if he could still come with her wherever with her meant. He didn\u2019t look at Leif when Leif frowned at him for breathing. He looked at Marin\u2019s face and in it he found the road they\u2019d take first: up through the shop and back down to the pier and then the night between now and dusk.\n\nOn the way out, one of the older women\u2014she wore her hair pinned in a way Marin remembered from a portrait in a corridor\u2014said softly, like a curse that is also a blessing: \u201cBeware her perfume.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou call it perfume now?\u201d Ezra said before he could stop himself.\n\nThe older woman\u2019s smile was not a smile. \u201cNames change as often as coats. Don\u2019t be fooled.\u201d\n\nMarin wanted to laugh and could not. They stepped back into Lyra\u2019s shop and Lyra said a thing under her breath and the moss rolled itself back down like a reluctant tongue. The humidity of the plants made the air honest again. Clocks outside were insisting it was later than anyone inside wanted it to be.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll walk you back,\u201d Lyra said. \u201cIf she\u2019s come this far, she\u2019s sniffing at your door. You\u2019ll want to wash your windows with vinegar and pinch salt into the tracks.\u201d\n\n\u201cSalt is expensive,\u201d Ezra said.\n\n\u201cSo is breathing,\u201d Lyra said.\n\nThey did as she suggested. They lugged a bag of rock salt up the stairs of Marin\u2019s building in Belltown while the landlord shouted pleasantries to someone on the phone and the elevator pretended it did not exist. Marin\u2019s apartment was two rooms and a view of the water if you stood on the bathtub and leaned out the window. It smelled like her and like notebooks and like toasted bread because she was unafraid to toast bread at all hours.\n\nEzra went at the window tracks with the seriousness he applied to everything that made him anxious. Lyra dotted the corners with something that smoked and then didn\u2019t. Marin put her coat on a chair and then took it off because the envelope was inside it and she wanted it closer and further away. She set it on the table. It pulsed. Ezra looked at it like it might sprout legs.\n\n\u201cTonight you sleep,\u201d Lyra said. \u201cOr you try. Tomorrow you go where you must.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know her?\u201d Ezra asked, surprising himself again.\n\nLyra considered. \u201cI know the way she smells. I know that she was always told to cover it. With spices and oils and flowers until the very air went blind. She hated that. You would, too. And now she wears it like a sash.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe princess of the place under the place,\u201d Ezra said. \u201cDoes she have any other descriptors besides what she smells like? That feels\u2014mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is mean,\u201d Lyra said. \u201cAnd it is convenient, and it is all some people ever learned to say about her. They made a scent into a story and the story into a destiny. People do that.\u201d\n\nMarin remembered, uninvited, the way the old stories described the princess of Mire: how her presence made milk turn and children cry and metal soot. How her hair tangled anything it entered like blackberry cane, how she spoke with a voice that left molasses on people\u2019s eardrums. How she cried once and her tears smelled so strong the dogs hid under the porch for a week. How she was told to bathe and bathe and bathe and never quite came clean because the word meant something else to her and they didn\u2019t say that word to her correctly. How when she laughed, which was rare, you could smell sweetness so intense it turned sugar to smoke. Marin couldn\u2019t remember any story with that laugh part in it. Did she invent it. Could she.\n\n\u201cShe will be worse alone,\u201d Lyra said, as if answering Marin\u2019s private weather. \u201cAnyone is.\u201d\n\nAfter Lyra left, Marin and Ezra ate soup that came from an orange carton because the soup they made themselves would have tasted like the fork in the road. They said nothing predictive and everything inane. They watched a dumb show and then the news and then turned the news off when it showed, meaning to be helpful, a map of smells reported in the last day.\n\nWhen Ezra left\u2014it was late and he had a cat of his own who would judge him for sleeping elsewhere\u2014Marin stood at the window and watched the blue neon down the block flicker in a nervous rhythm. She had an invitation on her table and rosemary in her sleeve and the city insisting, in gentle, annoying ways, that she belonged to it as much as she belonged to any realm.\n\nThe instructions came just before dawn when the rain finally decided to fall. It arrived as an ache in her left ankle where she had once scarred herself on a barnacle, as a word on the letter that hadn\u2019t been on the letter before and now was and had always been. It arrived in the way the kettle took longer to boil as if time considered itself savory, not sweet.\n\nMarin sat up in bed and said aloud to no one: \u201cAll right.\u201d The sound didn\u2019t fill the room. It didn\u2019t need to. It sat in the corner like a small animal that knows it\u2019s been named. She made coffee and held the mug with both hands because there are mornings when you need to hold a thing that hot to believe it is real.\n\nThe ferry in the bay blew its horn and the city looked at the sky like a lover who has already forgiven you one thousand times and will again make room. Marin smiled, crooked, and started to pack. She put maps in a bag; turned back and put more maps, then less. She put a sweater and a knife and a piece of chalk. She put a photograph of her father she almost never took out of the drawer, a man with a face that lit when water was mentioned. She put the rosemary in her hair and it made her look like she had not slept and also like she had a plan.\n\nShe almost forgot the letter. It hissed when she touched it, offended. She slid it into the inside pocket of her coat. It whispered to whatever lined the pocket, then went quiet the way dogs go quiet before they break their rope.\n\nOn her way out she pinned a note to the shop door with blue tape. Open late, it said. Maybe very late. Sorry\u2014princess stuff. Ezra would see it. He would save the joke and use it later because that is what you do with the things that keep you from breaking in half.\n\nThe bay was all metal and no light. The gulls lined the rail again, watching. Marin touched the iron, the cold, the paint in layers. She put her palm flat against it and felt the water\u2019s beat. It said different. It said beware. It said go now.\n\nShe went, moving as quickly as you can without running toward a meeting you cannot avoid. In her chest a small strong drumbeat kept time with the ferry across the water, with the city\u2019s heart, with something older and more complicated that had named her before she knew what names were. The smell threaded through the rain and into her lungs, not yet unbearable and yet not less itself. She breathed it and did not gag.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Marin said to the air, to whoever listened when you didn\u2019t know who did. \u201cYou invited me. I\u2019m coming.\u201d\n\nBehind her, in the bookstore, Sel stretched like an animal that knows when rain is about to slow. In another room under the city a table cleared its throat. Very far away and also close enough to touch if she only decided to extend her hand, someone laughed, a low roll like thunder in the barrel of a drum. It almost smelled sweet. It almost made your eyes water. It had been covering itself all these years and now had decided not to, and the choice was its own weapon.\n\nThe rain fell. The city let it, lovingly. The world shifted so slightly that most of the people in it would call it nothing at all. Marin, who knew better, kept walking.",

Marin walked under it with her collar turned up and her mouth tasting of coffee and rosemary because she had tucked the sprig behind her ear until the oils stained her fingers. Ezra met her halfway up the block, his scarf trailing like a streamer in a parade that no one had advertised, and he tried to say nothing in the way a person tries not to sing to a song already inside his throat. \u201cYou left a note,\u201d he said, and he held up the strip of blue tape he had peeled from the shop door as if it were evidence in a case about to turn on a technicality. \u201cPrincess stuff. You wrote princess stuff like it\u2019s laundry day.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is laundry day,\u201d she said, and she took the tape from him and set it on the lip of the trash can with the deliberation of someone making small bargains with the universe. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to think I\u2019d been abducted again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been abducted even once,\u201d he said, and he looked at her face to confirm this and then looked away because it made him feel the soft, unfunny part of fear that he preferred to dress in sarcasm. \u201cNot that I know of.\u201d\n\nInside the shop Sel was nowhere obvious and the heat had developed that kinetic personality old heating systems do when they believe they\u2019re part of the staff. The bell on the door clicked and then clicked again as if an invisible hand had taught it a joke and was repeating the punchline to steady itself. Marin hung her coat on the back of the counter and the letter inside it murmured against the wood in a language without vowels, and Ezra pretended not to hear because he had decided to be the kind of friend who does not require new rules every hour. \u201cWe could close early,\u201d he said while he arranged the geography shelf to show the spine of a book that had never sold but kept trying. \u201cOr we could close now. Or we could burn the store down and claim the insurance and use the money to flee to a landlocked state where the worst thing that happens is someone mispronounces rye.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not burning the store down,\u201d she said, and she smiled at him with half of a mouth because the other half had important business with the rest of the day. \u201cBesides, I like the way the floor complains. It will miss us if we\u2019re away.\u201d\n\nThey tried to let the hours behave. People drifted in with damp hair and opinions about the right size of a guidebook, and Marin wrapped packages in brown paper with twine and Ezra made change with coins that had been too recently in other pockets. The smell came and went like an argument in another apartment that you only hear when the walls have not had enough to eat, and when Marin looked at the window glass she saw not her face but a memory of glass less clear than this glass should be. \u201cIt\u2019s not just me,\u201d Ezra said when a woman at the counter flared her nostrils and frowned at the rafters because that felt safer than frowning at strangers. \u201cIt really is worse. It\u2019s like the city left something out of the fridge, and now it\u2019s daring us to taste it anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t taste anything,\u201d Marin said, and she wiped a square of the counter that didn\u2019t need wiping because it made her hands feel part of something she could still control. \u201cIf it offers a free sample, say no. If it offers a coupon, also say no. If it offers to fix your knee and your childhood, set it on fire and run.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose last two are difficult to do in tandem,\u201d he said, and when he laughed it was smaller than his usual laugh but it did the job he needed it to do. \u201cShould I chop onions so if I cry you can pretend it\u2019s the onions.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t own a pan,\u201d she said, and they both felt better for the scrap of normal given a place at the table.\n\nDusk in Seattle arrives like a polite relative with a suitcase, and that evening it shouldered the door open with a look that said I\u2019m only here until Sunday and then stayed anyway. The instructions, when they came, were not instructions until you noticed how they shaped the room around your noticing. The letter in her coat pocket swelled and shrank as if it were remembering how to be a lung; the bell over the door chimed a six-beat phrase that mapped onto nothing in the world of retail but exactly onto the way the ferry horns had conversed at sunrise; the neon sign across the street dropped a single blink and then held a steady light so calm Marin thought for a second she might weep. \u201cThat\u2019s very pretty,\u201d Ezra said, and his voice had found that place between wonder and dread that a person can live in only for a limited time.\n\n\u201cIt wants us to come,\u201d Marin said, and she took her coat and slid into it and felt the letter\u2019s chill like the back of a spoon against a wrist. \u201cWe should lock up.\u201d\n\n\u201cSel,\u201d Ezra said, because he had decided practical questions were a rope he could carry. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave Sel with the smell and the rain and the inventory.\u201d\n\nA gray tail materialized from under the travel books and Sel herself followed, stretching to the length of a moral dilemma and then blinking at them with a look she had borrowed from an ancestor who had once tolerated priests. Marin stooped and tapped Sel\u2019s forehead with two fingers and the cat turned her head to press against the hand because the contract between species had not yet fully dissolved. \u201cShe\u2019s hired the night watch,\u201d Marin said, and she set down a saucer with water that wasn\u2019t just water because a bit of rosemary had fallen into it and a few grains of salt had refused to be pinched into the window tracks and had tumbled instead into the dish. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine. She\u2019s the only thing that would survive if the entire city were shaved and put underwater.\u201d\n\n\u201cComforting,\u201d Ezra said, and he checked the back door twice, then once more for the superstition of it, and they stood in the doorway with the unfriendly dusk smelling their pockets to make sure they had brought change for its meters.\n\nThe city had made them a path that would not be a path to anyone else. Traffic lights luxuriated on green long enough to allow them to cross without breaking stride, and the street musicians measured their tempos so that the gaps between songs lined up as if a conductor had lifted a hand somewhere offshore. Down by the old ferry terminal a security chain lay puddled beside a gate without ever remembering it had once been the shape of a chain, and a gull with a missing foot watched them go with the satisfaction of a person who knows he will still be here after everyone has made their mistakes. \u201cI didn\u2019t know this door existed,\u201d Ezra said as Marin led him to an alcove where a vending machine sold nothing, and where the wall had the texture of a sentence scratched out and rewritten with more caution.\n\n\u201cIt only exists when the tide and the city have agreed over breakfast,\u201d she said, and she touched the metal panel that looked like it had always been a panel and felt it push back against her palm with the tenderness of something that hasn\u2019t been touched correctly in years. \u201cAnd when the Halfhouse wants to eat.\u201d\n\nIf anyone had been watching they would have seen two people stand too close to a vending machine and then vanish with the embarrassment of people who have realized they read the parking signs wrong. If anyone had been listening they would have heard the water shift its weight and then pretend it had always been comfortable. Ezra stepped through and found himself standing on a threshold that had been built out of accidents, and he took a breath so deep his chest admitted later it had been too ambitious. The air did not smell like nothing, because the Halfhouse would not submit to that lie; it smelled like plank, like warm plaster, like the rind of a fruit whose name no one had spoken aloud in three hundred years, and under it like the polite version of the Rot\u2019s perfume, the aftertaste of a word you have refused to pronounce.\n\nHe said \u201coh,\u201d but he did not say it as a single lost syllable. He said \u201coh\u201d and then he said, because his mouth was a creature that wanted to be helpful, \u201cthey never finished painting,\u201d and he meant the walls because the walls had coats of different colors that stopped mid-roller, and he meant the ceiling because the beams were half planed and half left to remind themselves of trees, and he meant the stairs because each step was a sample of a different carpenter\u2019s opinion of rise and run. \u201cIs it always like this,\u201d he asked, and he reached out for the banister and found that it became rope under his hand, then became something like iron, then became polished driftwood, as if it wanted to make sure no one felt excluded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never like anything,\u201d Marin said, and she took the stairs without looking like a person who trusts a thing that loves to change the subject. \u201cIt\u2019s like itself and then you are like yourself or you are not. That\u2019s the test.\u201d\n\nLyra waited in a doorway that was half open and half ajar, and she had abandoned her apron for a dress that looked like someone had woven dusk out of good intentions and then mended it at the shoulder with daylight. Her hands were clean, which made Marin like her and fear for her a little, and she raised her brows at Ezra in a way that said I see you decided to be brave on purpose. \u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d she said, and then she shook her head once because she knew that late and early braided themselves around summonses and that human clocks were ornaments the Halfhouse tolerated with amusement. \u201cNo, you\u2019re on time. Don\u2019t let Leif speak first.\u201d\n\nThe room beyond them had changed like a face learns to smile differently for a second photograph. The table was longer, and it had found a new compromise between water and wood and stone and glass, and Marin had the brief, horrible sensation that it had been eating while they were away. Delegates had arranged themselves the way people do when they are trying, failing, and trying again not to develop the grudges their grandparents cultivated with such care. Leif\u2019s beard had emancipated two additional curls, and the knife-smile woman wore a pin at her throat that made Ezra think of the sort of thorn that lives under a bridge and taxes the feet of the unwary. The girl with sandy hair waved at Marin with a quick, ingratiating tilt of the wrist, then withdrew her hand as if she had not meant to be friendly for that long.\n\n\u201cWe begin,\u201d Leif said, and he lifted a cup that contained a liquid that could have been tea or could have been the extracted patience of everyone present, and he drank the smallest possible sip and then set the cup down with the reverence of a man who believes he has done his part in a difficult ceremony. \u201cNews worsens. We have lost three drains on the southern run. They refuse to empty where they have emptied for a century and have opted instead to devote themselves to becoming gardens.\u201d\n\n\u201cGardens,\u201d the knife-smile woman said, and her mouth suggested that the word meant knives with flowers printed on their handles. \u201cHow charming, until the wrong things grow.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe wrong things always grow,\u201d said a man at the far end with shoulders like stacked crates. \u201cAsk a farmer. We are not farmers but we have eyes.\u201d\n\nA woman with a silver streak in her braid that had been applied by time but looked as if a design choice said, \u201cIn the mirrors at the art museum there were handprints at five this morning before the guards, and when they looked at the footage there was footage of handprints happening to the footage. We have drawn the curtains and we have told the docents to call it a commentary on labor.\u201d\n\nLyra did not sit. She stood with her hand on the back of a chair as if to anchor the chair in case anyone should become ambitious. \u201cThe roots under the transit tunnels had a dayling feast and then refused to sleep. They pulled three pilings because the pilings have been unfriendly for so long that friendship seemed like a prank. No one noticed because no one ever wishes to be told what holds them up until it fails, and then they wish it had announced its grievances like a person at a meeting.\u201d\n\nMarin listened with the steady blankness of someone who has decided not to cry because it would open a door she would not know how to close. Ezra listened and thought about buses and bridges and the trick in the neck he had when he had slept wrong, and he wondered what the city would sound like if the parts they never thought about decided to speak all at once. \u201cDo we know where she is,\u201d he asked, and he meant the princess with the perfume, and he felt a heat along his cheekbones that surprised him because he had not expected to be embarrassed by the question. \u201cYou talk about her as if\u2014look, I fold sweaters in retail when someone starts to shout because it gives their voice a hill to fall off. Would it help to\u2026insult her? Or praise her? Or send a casseroles?\u201d\n\n\u201cEzra,\u201d Marin said, and she touched his sleeve to place it in the category of human attempts that were bearable. \u201cWe do not casserole the other side.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know where she is because she wishes us to know where she is,\u201d the knife-smile woman said, and she had the peculiar light in her eyes of a person who enjoys no pleasures and so makes do with accuracy. \u201cShe has found a threshold that is willing to be disrespectful and she has knelt in it and taught it to be more so. She is in the Culvert of Eight Mouths, and if you think that sounds like a place we invented to frighten children you should imagine how it looks to a map.\u201d\n\nLeif slid a sheet toward Marin that was not a map until she put two fingers on it and told it that she knew where north lived, and then the lines grew stubborn and dark and arranged themselves into the southern belly of the city with its pipes and its seams. Ezra leaned in and felt the pull of a diagram that had not been meant for him but did not mind briefly letting him think otherwise, and he pointed with a finger he didn\u2019t realize he had put there. \u201cHere,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looks like\u2026a star that someone smudged.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a thing that opens several things at once,\u201d Lyra said, and she spoke so softly the table leaned in to collect the sound. \u201cYou can close it by teaching it to be ashamed of its options. You can also set it on fire. You could cover it with the kind of concrete only guilt knows how to pour. Or you could walk to it and ask it to choose you instead of her.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou make it sound like a lover,\u201d the sandy-haired girl said, and her expression implied she had heard about this but had not yet found a way to be enthusiastic.\n\n\u201cA threshold is a lover,\u201d Lyra said, and she didn\u2019t wait for anyone to flinch or snicker. \u201cWe think of doors as politenesses, but a threshold is a proposition. The city is full of them and you step over them all day thinking the contract is about shoes on and shoes off when the contract is about which version of you is allowed to pass.\u201d\n\nMarin set her hands on the map and felt the Culvert like a tooth you touch with your tongue because it has begun to ache and because you cannot leave it alone. The smell pressed in at the windows of the room and left its fingerprints on the glass, and someone in a corner near the suggestion of a hearth began to cough with the subdued determination of a person who refuses to make a scene but belongs to a body that disagrees. \u201cI go,\u201d Marin said, and she was grateful to herself for not making the sentence into a question. \u201cI go now, while it is dusk enough that the pipes will think I am not trying to be clever.\u201d\n\nLeif nodded because he had always liked her best when she sounded least like someone who wanted him to approve. The knife-smile woman relaxed by a degree measurable only by people whose job it was to know such things, and Lyra took a tin from her pocket and shook into her palm a line of dark seeds that smelled like a forest floor holding its breath at the edge of a burn. \u201cCrush them,\u201d Lyra said, and she poured the seeds into Marin\u2019s hand and then covered Marin\u2019s hand with her own as if they were bargaining over dice. \u201cSmear a little on your throat and on the inside of your wrists. It will not make you invisible. It will persuade some things that you have been seen already by someone worthy.\u201d\n\nEzra did not trust his voice and so he occupied his mouth with the act of finding the knife he knew was in Marin\u2019s bag and checking with his eyes and his fingers that it agreed to open and close when asked. He did not like knives unless they pretended to be butter spreaders, but he liked the idea of her carrying a dull blade less, and he liked the smell rising around the edges of the room least of all. \u201cI will walk you to the beginning,\u201d he said, and he was surprised by the fact that no one told him he could not. \u201cAfter that I will obey the part of me that isn\u2019t a teenager.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe beginning moves,\u201d the sandy-haired girl said, and then she looked down at her hands and was ashamed of the tone but not the words. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to keep up.\u201d\n\nThey took their time leaving because to leave a room like this badly is to insult it, and the Halfhouse exacts its rudeness tax in ways that are never financial. Marin folded the map into a shape someone had taught her when she was small and trying to turn everything into a ship, and Ezra collected his jangling thoughts and slipped them into his pockets like change that might be enough to pay for a late bus. Lyra walked with them to the gate that had not been a gate when they entered, and she stopped where the floor suggested tiles that suggested a kitchen where someone had once burned onions with the intention of making someone else forgive them. \u201cI will keep the rosemary alive,\u201d Lyra said, and she adjusted the sprig behind Marin\u2019s ear as if it were a misplaced comma. \u201cWhen you come back the city will not be the same. Try not to be offended on its behalf when it fails, for a while, to welcome your return properly.\u201d\n\nOutside, the night had congested itself into a shape the streetlights were going to need help to navigate. The ferry horns sounded like polite bulls in other fields, and beneath that Ezra could hear a low talk in the pipes that he would probably never be able to unhear now that he had heard it at all. Marin walked south not because south had ever agreed to be her friend but because enemies are predictable if you treat them correctly, and Ezra kept pace with his hands in his pockets so his fingers would not make promises without consulting him. Cars hissed; windows poured light and then reconsidered; a man on a bicycle applesauced his brakes at a corner and then grinned apologetically because the night had made him too fast and he felt bad about it. \u201cThere,\u201d Marin said when the street sloped and then lifted and then sloped again like breath, and she did not point because some places hold grudges against fingers.\n\nIt looked like a storm drain until you watched it and it became a mouth, and then it became eight mouths taking turns pretending to be one. The grate had been built in a decade that fancied itself practical, but vines had educated it in cursive, and a trickle had reconsidered trickling and swollen itself into a statement too dignified to splash. Ezra stood at its edge and felt the unpleasant pleasantness of being noticed by a thing that did not have eyes for him and had eyes enough regardless, and he swallowed and wished his saliva had more gallantry. \u201cThis is the part where I say don\u2019t,\u201d he said after he had assembled that sentence several times inside and found that each version left him feeling a different brand of cowardly. \u201cThis is also the part where I do not say it, because I have used that word too often on small things and it would be rude to waste it now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know the route for the first part,\u201d Marin said, and her left ankle ached the way an old bell aches on a quiet afternoon when there is no service and still a tolling chooses to ring inside its iron. \u201cAfter that the threshold will change its mind and we will change with it or we will be spat out and then I will have to come back and invent a story for Leif that he will not like and that will be fine. Hold this.\u201d\n\nShe handed him the envelope because even she had admitted that she did not need to carry all her names into every room, and he took it with the solemnity it demanded and resented that it demanded it and stroked the seal with his thumb because he had learned that touching things does not always make them worse. \u201cIf she is\u2026if she is like the stories, you shouldn\u2019t go alone,\u201d he said, and he hated the sound of his own caution because he wanted to be the kind of person who said run or the kind of person who said stop instead of the kind of person who said a sentence with two ifs. \u201cIf she laughs and it smells like sugar burning, if she cries and the dogs hide, if she tangles, if she brags.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is a person,\u201d Marin said, and she surprised herself with the anger in her voice because it had been living there quietly for years, and she had fed it crumbs because anger is easier to manage when it is hungry. \u201cShe is a person they made a scent out of because they did not want to use the word power. She can be cruel. She can be kind. She can be bored. She can be wrong. I am not afraid of her so much as I am afraid of everyone else\u2019s certainty about what she is.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he said, and he folded the envelope and put it under his arm like a newspaper and resolved to pretend it was a newspaper if anyone asked, and then prayed no one would because he had never learned card tricks and he did not now want to learn how to trick a city while standing on a curb. \u201cCome back,\u201d he said, and he liked that better than don\u2019t, and he liked that he could say it like a request and like a promise and like a cuss.\n\nShe stepped down to the lip of the culvert and felt the way the mouths nested, one inside another like bowls that have been used for mixing and for serving and for hiding money. The first breath was the worst; the first step was the worst; the second step was worse than she had expected because the smell pressed itself into her ears the way street noise does when you have fallen asleep and it has not. She laid her palm flat on the iron at the juncture where rust had won three times and been painted over four, and she whispered the compromise her father had taught her, the one that makes a pipe choose to loathe you quietly instead of loudly. The iron quit its version of sighing and the flow leaned to let her pass, and for a moment she was a girl at a door again and the door had decided, without flourish, that it would rather like her.\n\n\u201cKeep my seat,\u201d she said, and she did not add please because the city does not love that word in rooms like this, and Ezra nodded as if chairs had become creatures whose feelings had to be respected or they might one day decide not to hold anyone up. \u201cIf it rains harder, go back,\u201d she said, and she did not look behind her when she said it because she always hated being told to go home after she had set out, and she did not want to turn this into someone else\u2019s version of that.\n\nEzra did not answer because he had decided that his tongue would turn against him if he let it, and he watched her move down into the not-dark with a steadiness that looked like grace and felt like practice. The sound changed around her; the water learned her name and didn\u2019t know if it wanted to sing it or warn it, and the concrete changed the temperature of its attention as if to say I notice you and would prefer not to, and the smell tested the rosemary and decided it would not have her on those terms. She went anyway, and he watched until watching became seeing nothing, and then he listened until listening became a way of speaking without letting go of the envelope.\n\nThe culvert did not devour her; it accepted her with the affronted tolerance of a host who believes he has been surprised when in fact he has been warned. She moved past the place where snails hold small parliaments and through the place where a city engineer had once lost a glove and sworn into the acoustics until they bit him back, and the mouths opened and closed the way an animal will breathe more loudly when it wants you to think it is asleep. A slick grew and then dissipated under her boots when she refused to change her stride, and once she heard, ahead, the unmistakable sound of laughter pitched to carry only as far as it needed to carry. It smelled sweet and then not, like a jar of something thick left opened on a windowsill and then rescued by someone who hated to waste.\n\n\u201cPrincess,\u201d said a voice that would have been contralto if it had bothered with music, and the word did not curl with mockery so much as it sat up and watched what she would do. \u201cYou brought your wrist-salt and your green needles and your small knife. You brought your worries about your friend and your desire not to be a machine. You brought your stories about me in your mouth. How heavy are they.\u201d\n\nMarin did not stop, and she did not hasten because the culvert liked to make quickness into farce. \u201cNot as heavy as everyone else\u2019s stories,\u201d she said, and she chose her footing with the infuriating carefulness of someone who refuses to give a floor the satisfaction of a slip. \u201cI left those on a table where men could admire them and imagine they had made them themselves.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause, and in the pause the water found an old bottle and spun it so the bottle could remember being useful. \u201cGood,\u201d said the voice, and it came from ahead and behind and from inside the iron as if something had learned to speak through bolts. \u201cThen come measure me without them and I will measure you without yours. If you are lucky we will both be wrong.\u201d\n\nAt the curb above, Ezra sat down because standing had become an act of defiance and he was wearing the wrong shoes for that kind of rebellion. He rested his elbows on his knees and held the envelope as if it could catch the rain if the rain began again, and he hummed to himself not because he had a tune but because humming keeps the throat honest. Two gulls argued about nothing in particular, and then a third arrived and peered down as if to say he had always planned to witness something important this evening and would be disappointed if any of them backed out. The city leaned into its own sound and felt the shift of a person taking steps in a place where steps mean more than they ought, and it made the small, stubborn decision to keep its lights on a fraction longer than usual. It had been told too many times to leave the rooms dim for a mood it did not ask for.\n\nBelow, the mouths widened and narrowed, and Marin moved into the center where the echo behaved and where the smell was strongest. It was worse up close in the way a thing becomes more itself when it no longer has to pass through milk or morning, but underneath there was something else, something she could not have articulated to a room that thought it understood the words foul and pure. It smelled like loam not convinced it was rotten, like a pond deciding if it wanted to be barn or field, like a body no one had told the right story about. She wished, for a second, fiercely, unfairly, that her father were there with his lineman\u2019s hands and his jokes about pipes that needed flattery, and then she wished it less because wishing pulled you off your feet and she needed her feet to believe in her.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t cover it,\u201d she said into the half-dark, and her voice struck the water and made of it a dish, and she felt the way a listening happens in the moment before an animal decides if it must run. \u201cThey told you to love a perfume the way they love a lie. Don\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t put a flower on a wound and then force everyone to admire your bouquet.\u201d\n\nThe laugh did not come and she could not decide if that was victory. A shift did, though, a settlement as if something had crouched and then made itself taller so that it would not be accused of shrinking. \u201cYou talk like a city,\u201d said the voice, and it smiled, and she smelled sugar singe and then went past it into the flavor of green things steeped too long in hot water. \u201cYou use the time it takes for a light to change as a metaphor for patience. You confuse direction with mercy. Did you come to order me to stay small.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came to ask you to stop knocking on windows with your smell,\u201d she said, and if this was foolish then she would be foolish; if this was arrogance then she would accept it later when she was somewhere other than here. \u201cIf you want to build a road between our rooms, build it with stone. If you want us to meet in the Halfhouse, meet in the Halfhouse. If you want to make a city sneeze until it confesses what it never meant to hide, you will make of us only a chorus of non-words.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou care about their noses,\u201d the voice said, and it was curious not cruel. \u201cYou care about their little forks and their chalk. You care about their sleeping. Does your caring make you less mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes me more mine,\u201d Marin said, and she closed her eyes because the culvert had always tried to glamor people into looking where they ought not, and she had learned that sometimes you gain more by refusing the geography. \u201cAnd you are not my owner. We were not meant to be each other\u2019s cages.\u201d\n\nSomething touched her ankle lightly, and she did not kick not because she was brave but because she knew that anything she did not understand down here would take any suggestion and magnify it into law. A current swirled with intent and then smoothed itself respectful, and she smelled, suddenly, clean stone after rain, and realized she was being assessed with a nose other than her own. \u201cThey said you ran,\u201d said the voice, and this time there was laughter in it and none of it asked permission to be pretty. \u201cThey said you left the rooms meant for you because they were interrupted by your breathing. They said you were tired of being named and tired of the way your name brought you plates and then debt. They said you went to smell coffee instead and learn sarcasm. How is sarcasm. Does it hold when the bridge shakes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does if your friend is on the bridge,\u201d she said, and she opened her eyes and found herself at the place where the eight mouths met, and it did not look like a mouth at all but like a choice made eight times and regretted not once. \u201cIt holds if you also have a rope. It is not my rope. It is just something to put on the rope so your hands remember they are part of you.\u201d\n\nShe did not know what the rules were for meeting a princess who had been reduced to an odor by people who didn\u2019t want to say power, and whatever ceremony had been written she had not studied, and so she did the thing she always did when the script failed her. She put her palm flat against the iron that ran like a spine through the middle of the mouths, and she pressed until the chill of it crept up into the bone of her hand, and she said her name in the way no one puts on paper, and then she said, because it mattered and because it was the thing that they never refused to record, the name of the city that had claimed her first without talking it over. The water stood up for a heartbeat, and then it bowed, and then it remembered its contract and continued to pretend it did not care.\n\nAbove, Ezra counted sixty and then counted sixty more because numbers have always been a way to remain inside a moment once it tries to spill you. A man with a dog asked if he was okay, and Ezra said he was waiting for a friend, and the man nodded because that is a phrase that makes people generous, and then the dog sneezed, and Ezra felt awful for the small insult the air had delivered to its nose. The envelope pulsed once and then went still like a child falling asleep on a couch that will have to be converted into a bed, and he thought, briefly, about every job he had ever had that had asked him to be patient with a person pretending to be telling the truth, and he laughed because no one here would be impressed by how well he handled returns.\n\nBelow, the laughter returned where the iron met the notion of sky, and it came from someone this time and not just a place. The woman who stepped from the turn of the culvert did not glow, because only fools ask that of other people, but the space learned to see in the way a face learns to recognize a new lamp. She wore no crowns and the fish who had found their way into the culvert did not bow because fish know what they know and do not care for theater, but the air arranged its weight around her with a deference that made Marin\u2019s lungs pay attention. Her dress was the color of olive brine, and her hair had climbed itself into snarls as if it were determined to build refuge without assistance, and her eyes were the color of a bruise that has chosen the day it will stop being one. The smell moved with her the way heat does when a door opens in winter, and it made a case for itself that did not entirely repulse.\n\n\u201cYou brought rosemary,\u201d the princess of Mire said, and she smiled in a way that made you think of gratitude and then of knives used to butter bread. \u201cThat is either polite or passive-aggressive. I have always respected both.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt reminds my fingers what green feels like,\u201d Marin said, and the truth made the conversation sit more calmly than a lie would have. \u201cI thought you\u2019d prefer that to incense.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate incense,\u201d the other woman said, and she lifted her hands, then let them fall, and every rivulet in the place rethought its commitment to its present direction. \u201cThey used to smudge me until I wept. The men with the long sleeves and the women with the clean skirts. They tried to smoke me out of myself and then they told me I was ungrateful for the effort. What a normal thing to do to a girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cNormal,\u201d Marin said, and between them a small fish tried to leap and then changed its mind because you were supposed to save your energy for when the right mouth opened. \u201cStupid. It does not matter which word we choose because all of our words are rotten if they refuse to admit what they have done.\u201d\n\nThe princess tilted her head as if listening to something arriving from far away, and for an instant Marin smelled sugar so powerfully that she tasted a childhood dessert she had adored and then resented because it had been offered as a consolation when she had wanted justice. \u201cYou did not come to scold me,\u201d the other woman said, and there was wonder in it and Marin did not know whether to be happy or sad that wonder could live in that voice. \u201cThey rattled their letters and their seals and their tin cups and begged me to be ashamed. You came with no bells. Why.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I am so tired,\u201d Marin said, and she laughed, and the culvert held its sound against its ribs like an animal considering whether to keep a stray. \u201cBecause I do not have the breath to pretend you cannot smell like what you smell like. Because I want the city to be able to eat breakfast without thinking it has sat down to dine in a cellar. Because I think you are lonely and I think that makes you loud.\u201d\n\nThe princess of Mire did not lower her eyes and she did not flare her nostrils either, and she looked past Marin at the eight mouths agreeing, for once, to be a single throat. \u201cIf I quiet,\u201d she said, and she said quiet like a verb that had been punished early and often, \u201cwill they open something for me. If I quiet, will they allow me into rooms where they keep the keys. If I quiet, will they stop inventing stories that make children spit when they hear my name.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Marin said, and because she could feel how that landed she kept speaking so the refusal would not have to sit in the room alone. \u201cNo, they won\u2019t do any of that until they think it was their idea, and maybe not even then. But if you quiet it will be because you decided to and not because they made you. And if you decide to be loud it will be because you are singing and not because you are banging on our windows until our crockery shakes.\u201d\n\nThere was a long minute during which the culvert asked for everyone\u2019s attention and received it, and the smell shifted through pastures it had not met recently and forgot, briefly, to be a weapon. The princess lifted a hand to her own throat and rubbed the place a perfume bottle would have claimed if she had tolerated bottles, and she wiped the oil across her fingers and then into the water as if to baptize a thing that does not require baptism. \u201cYou are a person,\u201d she said at last, and she made person sound like a promotion. \u201cYou talk like a pipe and like a girl and like a city with its hair down. If I say I will come to the Halfhouse and sit in a chair that is made of materials I do not love, will you keep the knives from my back with your mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d Marin said, and she meant with words and with the tone a person uses before a storm, and she meant with lies that were not lies so much as shapes of truth people could be made to accept. \u201cI will tell them a better story. I will tell them that no one likes to be smoked. I will tell them that we are tired of smelling each other\u2019s fear.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d the other woman said, and the sugar went out of the air as if she had drawn it back into herself not like a trick but like breathing. \u201cGood. I will come. I will come tomorrow with my shoes on and my hair as it is and my wrists unpunished. I will come and I will let them look and then I will tell them where I have been.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring no incense,\u201d Marin said, and she almost smiled because the words felt like a protection even if they would be ignored.\n\n\u201cI will bring a jar of something to sweeten their tea and they will not know whether to drink it,\u201d the princess said, and she stepped back so that the water could forget she had been in its middle. \u201cTell your bearded man to sit on his beard. Tell the one with the pin to take it from her throat and put it on her shoe. Tell the girl with the hair that she should come closer and not speak unless she intends to say she was wrong. Tell the plant woman to water the rosemary until it shouts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d Marin said, and she drew breath for the first time in minutes without noticing because it had been so long since her lungs had been allowed to do it without interference. \u201cAnd you\u2014don\u2019t knock at dawn.\u201d\n\nThe princess laughed, and it broke and reassembled and came back with a sound that might have been kindness. \u201cI have never once knocked,\u201d she said, and she turned, and as she vanished into the right-hand throat she left behind a filament of scent that did not smell like rot at all but like the first time you crush a leaf and finally understand what someone meant when they named the plant. \u201cI have pushed. You are the first to push back with the right degree of shoulder.\u201d\n\nWhen Marin climbed back toward the street her knees discovered how many decades they believed themselves to have endured, and a drop of something found its way inside her collar and down her spine, and she did not shiver because cold has always liked to be rewarded. Ezra stood at the curb with his jaw set and the envelope under his arm and the look of a man who has chosen not to interrupt the conversation he wasn\u2019t invited to, and when he saw her he released his jaw and put, without flourish, the letter back into her hand. \u201cHow was the museum,\u201d he asked in a voice that wanted to betray him and did not quite succeed.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s coming to the Halfhouse,\u201d Marin said, and she felt the truth of it seat itself across from her and open its napkin and pick up its knife with the good manners of a person raised to pretend. \u201cTomorrow. We have to tell them before they decide they know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should bring\u2026cookies,\u201d he said, and he was only half kidding, and his mouth did a thing that meant he was trying to balance the weight of what he had not been allowed to see with the weight of what he now had to hold. \u201cSomething for the table. Something to make everyone remember their better selves.\u201d\n\n\u201cLyra will glare at me if I arrive with sugar,\u201d Marin said, and she looped her arm through his because anchors carry the responsibility of being lines as well as weights. \u201cShe will glare at me and then she will eat them when no one is looking. We\u2019ll stop at the bakery with the bad coffee and the good butter.\u201d\n\nThey walked up from the mouths the way you walk up from any place that has asked you to remember and then remember differently, and the night watched them with interest because nights, too, get bored with repetition. In a window, a woman watered a plant and then apologized to it for forgetting; at a corner, a young man practiced a speech that would go badly and then go well when he changed one sentence; from the bay, the ferry signaled a thing that meant the deckhands had found something in a coil of rope and were undecided whether to keep it. The smell loosened its hold and retreated to the edges where it planned, and Marin breathed until her lungs understood again which job belonged to them and which to the part of her that wanted to be a machine because machines don\u2019t get asked to cry.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll hate it,\u201d Ezra said, and he didn\u2019t mean her, and he didn\u2019t mean the other woman, and he didn\u2019t mean anything except the sound a room makes when it realizes it was not the first to receive news. \u201cThey\u2019ll hate that you went and made a promise before they could steam the table.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll pretend to,\u201d Marin said, and she thought of Leif and his cup and the knife at the woman\u2019s throat that would be on her shoe, and she thought of the sandy-haired girl and the way she would look at the visitor as if she had never seen a person with a problem and then realize that was what they all were. \u201cBut they wanted this. They always do. They never want to ask for it because then they would have to thank whoever brings it, and gratitude is the heaviest glass.\u201d\n\nAt the top of the hill he stopped and she stopped because a moment had requested to be noticed, and he reached with his free hand and wiped with his thumb the smear of oil Lyra had told her to put on her throat. He held his thumb up and smelled it and made a face without theatrics, and then he smiled because it was an honest face and he trusted those more when the city had decided to use perfume as punctuation. \u201cYou smell like standing in a garden after it rains,\u201d he said, and he let his hand drop because his thumb had done its work. \u201cAnd also like the back room of a bar that refused to allow cigarettes and so still smells faintly of cherries. I can work with that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all any of us are doing,\u201d she said, and they walked into the part of night where the lights knew their jobs and the windows performed the trick of letting people watch without being watched, and somewhere the Halfhouse shifted its weight to make room for new chairs. The ferry called again and the gulls answered badly and no one minded because the language they shared didn\u2019t care for pitch so much as endurance, and Marin felt in her ankle and in the letter and in the rosemary the small, insistent tug of tomorrow assembling itself.",

Marin woke to the hollow applause of tires on the soaked street and lay for a breath listening for the ache at her ankle that told her a summons had not been rescinded. It pulsed once in the place where a barnacle had bitten her years ago and said the smallest version of yes. The letter on the table had turned itself slightly, as if it had been looking out the window while she slept. It smelled faintly like what iron remembers when you rub it with a lemon. She made coffee with the vengeance of a person who has decided to trust the simplest machines, then held her mug over the sink so her hands could believe steam was not just a myth this city told itself in winter.\n\nEzra arrived with a white box tied in red striped string because theater matters to pastry, and when he opened it the small, proud faces of cookies looked up like townspeople gathered to vote. His scarf was a catastrophe and his hair was on the civic council of static and he spoke in a tone pitched deliberately light so it would not crack under a weight it had not been trained to carry. \u201cThey were out of the plain ones,\u201d he said, and he held the box as if it were a controversial document. \u201cThese have sugary grief sprinkled on top. The clerk swore it was sea salt, but I\u2019ve been lied to by bakers before and survived, though not unchanged.\u201d\n\n\u201cLyra will forgive the sugar if the butter is honest,\u201d Marin said, and she reached into the box and rearranged the cookies so that the ones with the most enthusiastic crystals were tucked under the modest ones. \u201cWe\u2019re not bribing anyone. We\u2019re lubricating the mood, which is different if you grew up in a house where adjectives had moral hierarchies.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou grew up in a house with nouns that glowed under certain lights,\u201d he said, and he eased himself onto a chair and put his chin on his fist and considered her with the seriousness he saved for strangers in expensive boots. \u201cYou slept. Or you pretended at a professional level.\u201d\n\n\u201cI slept the way the pipes do when a ferry cuts its engine at the slip. They remember to be quiet and then they gossip about the quiet.\u201d She tucked rosemary into the collar of her coat so that when she moved it touched her throat like a small hand with good intentions. \u201cShe\u2019ll come. She said so. Sometimes that\u2019s a spell.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd sometimes it\u2019s an RSVP left on read,\u201d he said, and when he smiled it was the smile of a person trying to find the nerve to believe in the better outcome without appearing naive. \u201cLeif will enjoy being told what to do. Please let me watch that happen. Please bottle it. Please line the shelves with it between the rare atlases so that on slow afternoons we can take it down and pour a shot.\u201d\n\nShe buttoned her coat and the letter snicked against the buttons like a fishbone stubborn in a soup. The smell outside had retreated overnight to the seams of things and kept its counsel there. Marin could feel it in the elevator\u2019s cables and in the chalk line where the curb had been mended last spring by a crew that listened to baseball on a radio slightly older than the foreman. \u201cYou keep the box,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll carry the map that isn\u2019t looking like a map yet and the letter that wishes it could be a knife.\u201d\n\nThey walked the four blocks between her door and the vending machine that wasn\u2019t, and in that distance they saw six umbrellas betray the wrists that held them, one dog choose dignity over a puddle and then reconsider, a woman in a puffer jacket weep without theatrics at a bus stop as if grief was a scheduled service she couldn\u2019t afford to miss, and a child in boots so red they altered the weather around them by stubborn will alone. Marin found it comforting the way rain flattens everyone\u2019s hair to a common denominator; she liked a city that didn\u2019t make fusses to pretend it wasn\u2019t feeling anything, and this morning Seattle wore its feeling on every awning.\n\nThe Halfhouse tolerated them early the way a good hostess tolerates guests who don\u2019t know when the table expects them. Inside, the air carried the breath of bread and tile and fresh-cut boards, and Lyra was waiting in a room that had decided today it preferred to resemble a parlor freshly invaded by carpenters. She had damp soil on her forearms in green-grey smears and had gathered her hair into a braid that had its own opinions about straight lines. On a trestle beside her a rosemary in a clay pot had been watered until its upright stems looked faintly arrogant. \u201cI woke it,\u201d she said when Marin looked at the plant as if it had spoken. \u201cYou asked me to make it shout. It has opinions about the acoustics in here. I told it the Halfhouse refuses condescension and the rosemary agreed to behave.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I put my pin on my shoe now,\u201d said the knife-smile woman without looking up from where she was instructing someone with a ledger to draw a line in ink that should look like a suggestion, not a rule. She wore no pin today at her throat and there was a glint of metal at her instep that looked like a small, embarrassed star. Leif, who had either slept in his beard or arranged it in his sleep for maximum commentary, sat with his hands on his knees to keep himself from drum-tapping the table into an admission of something undignified.\n\n\u201cYou put it there if you intend to keep your word,\u201d Marin said to the woman and to the room and to the idea that ceremonials crumble without the participation of the people who despise them. \u201cLeif, sit on your beard and not your opinions. You can keep your opinions on your lap if they behave. The girl with the sandy hair\u2014come closer. Don\u2019t speak until you mean to apologize. The apology may be for yourself and not for us. That counts.\u201d\n\nThe girl\u2019s mouth pulled into a line that might become soft if you fed it enough humility, and she moved to the edge of the table as if the wood would bite if she rushed it. Across from them the older woman with the portrait hair had secured a handful of dried bay leaves to the back of her shoe with thread that had belonged to her grandmother. She did not appear to expect anyone to notice and would be offended if they did, so Ezra pretended to become fascinated by the grain of the table and the way it refused to run entirely straight like wood under the influence of a conversation.\n\n\u201cWe have not lit incense,\u201d Leif said, and there was injury in it, which in him looked like a humorless man startled by his own failure to be obeyed by himself. \u201cI told them no. They love to light things and crowd the air. I told them to hold their hands in their sleeves and think their thoughts by themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Marin said, and she set the pastry box down near the end where the chairs were polite enough to hold the weight of human generosity without creaking. \u201cWe brought cookies. They are salty whether or not the baker intends them to be. This is not a bribe; it is a suggestion. Take the suggestion in your mouths before you take it into your agendas.\u201d\n\nEzra watched a dozen glances ricochet off the box with the wariness of clergy considering a gift from laypeople, and he had to look at the ceiling to keep from laughing when Leif\u2019s hand moved toward the lid and then stopped and then moved again as if participating in a dance he had not been told was choreographed. The knife-smile woman took a cookie, examined the salt crystal as if she could interrogate it into peril, then ate it and closed her eyes for a moment like a person who has been holding her breath for a week without noticing. Her shoe pin winked in what could be construed as gratitude.\n\nThe room arranged itself for being told news, and Marin told it. She said the princess of Mire had agreed to come to the Halfhouse without ceremony and without being smoked and without wearing other people\u2019s apologies. She said she had asked for no titles and no throne and only a chair that would hold her and a room that did not insist on pretending that air had never met her body. She said she had asked them to stop knocking with smell at dawn and would come as soon as the pipes agreed to walk her without devouring her cuffs. This reporting should have been uneventful, but news is a live thing, and it set the table to humming and the walls to paying attention.\n\n\u201cThey will say we brought a storm into a stable,\u201d Leif said, and he ate another cookie defensively, like someone chewing a doctrine. \u201cThey will say we were lax and then say we were tyrants in the same breath. They will say the word rot and they will say the word perfume and they will mean neither. If we let her in, we allow the city to believe it is normal to invite the under into rooms with windows. If we bar the door we lose the right to call ourselves a Concord.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop thinking of doors as moral instruments,\u201d Lyra said, and she set a small bowl of damp earth near the head of the table where light fell grudgingly. \u201cThis is not a parable unless you force it to be. This is a meeting. Let it be one. We can choose courtesy without agreeing to become rugs.\u201d\n\nThe mirror delegates arrived like a rumor into which a person had put effort. They came through the paneling by moving the light rather than wood, and each of them wore expressions that were difficult to read because they were busy translating their faces from a dialect glass prefers. The one in front had hair the color of clean blades and held a hand mirror with the solemnity of a toddler carrying a sibling down a staircase. She bowed as if teaching gravity etiquette. \u201cWe have covered the museum glass,\u201d she said in a voice that did not echo, which was in itself a courtesy. \u201cIt sulked and then agreed. We have asked the fountains to say nothing unnecessary. We have brought a room that can hold what will be said if it turns out to be heavier than the chairs.\u201d\n\nMarin looked at them with the old affection she had for things that are both honest and not to be trusted, and she felt the way the Halfhouse approved their entrance, which was a relief because the Halfhouse\u2019s disapproval has been known to make people sprain their ankles in rooms that do not own stairs. \u201cYou\u2019ve been reflecting what doesn\u2019t belong to you,\u201d she said, and she didn\u2019t mean it as an accusation so much as a diagnosis. \u201cYou know it. The smell is multiplied by glass. Ask it not to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe asked,\u201d said the second mirror-woman, whose cheekbones had taken a shine to being mistaken for knives. \u201cIt said there was nothing of it that didn\u2019t belong to us already. It said breath has been using us since breath learned to make windows fog. It said no. We have been feeling bruised and have decided to stop inventing metaphors about it.\u201d\n\nThe ferry horn in the bay sounded, and the mirrors turned their heads a fraction, which is their way of admitting they are charmed by something. Ezra, who had been trying to figure out if the delegates in reflective clothes dimmed when the sky did, let his eyes catch the wave of attention moving through the room as if a wind that had never been outside had dared to come in. The Halfhouse likes to announce arrivals to itself before anyone knocks, and in the marrow of the floor he felt the small lurch that meant it was time to practice their surprise.\n\nShe came without flourish and with all the flourish a body brings by being wholly its own weather. The smell preceded her but it did not punch. It arrived like a heavy fabric lifted and then set down with care, and underneath was a line of sweetness that did not intend to beguile so much as it insisted on being named correctly. The princess of Mire stepped between two chairs and stood with her feet apart in the posture of people who have had to learn how to take their own height seriously, and she looked around the room with a gaze that did not flit, that did not judge, that did not forgive. She did not wear shoes as contrition; she wore shoes because the day was cold and she did not intend to arrive as naked metaphor.\n\nLeif\u2019s beard tried to leap up to remind him it had things to say; he kept it seated. The knife-smile woman lifted her chin and displayed her throat as bare as it had probably been in decades, and then she looked down at her shoe and was faintly pleased to see the pin there doing its tiny, punishing work. The sandy-haired girl stepped forward without being prompted and did not speak. Ezra watched the mirror delegates not flinch, which means they flinched nobly, and Lyra looked at the floor to give the floor a chance not to betray its habit of curling its edges toward things it loves.\n\n\u201cThank you for not burning anything that smells like a priest,\u201d said the princess, and her voice felt in the room the way iron feels in the mouth when the blood has surprised you. \u201cThank you for eating butter with your anger. Thank you for moving your knives off your throats. Thank you for allowing a person to be a person and not an epithet wearing a dress.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a bowl of dirt on the table,\u201d the older woman with the portrait hair said courteously, as if reporting the weather. \u201cWe brought it to help the room remember to breathe. You may laugh at us. We cannot stop you.\u201d\n\nThe princess lowered her face to the bowl and inhaled like a woman who has not been allowed to inhale without apology, and her expression softened into something that made the smell around her change its mind about being a weapon. \u201cYou put soil on a table,\u201d she said, and she looked at Lyra as if she had just been introduced to someone who might understand her jokes. \u201cYou are asking a room to understand bodies. Good. You are already better than the last set of chairs that asked me into them.\u201d\n\nMarin didn\u2019t wait for Leif to take the podium of his own throat. She spoke before the room could turn its attention into a cudgel. \u201cWe have what we always have,\u201d she said, and she put her hands on the table so the table would know whose voice to weight. \u201cWe have a city. We have a shoreline that thinks it can be a straight line and then learns it is a curve. We have other rooms under this one and under those and a room that insists on being on the other side of every glass anyone ever had the nerve to polish. We have people who understand that smell is a language well before it is a weapon, and we have people who pretend to be allergic to what they don\u2019t want to name. We have a princess who has been refused a pronoun that does not reduce her to what she does to milk. We have a Council that would prefer to be a chorus and has learned that sometimes it must be a throat. We have biscuits.\u201d\n\nLaughter around a table at a moment like that is less humor and more oxygen, and the room breathed. Leif unclenched enough to remember that he had older impulses than instructing chairs. The mirror women tilted their hand-lamps ever so slightly until the light in the room was flattering without lying. Ezra could see the corners again; his head stopped rehearsing catastrophes and started to file away the small, bright fact that people can be better than their training when biscuits are present.\n\nThey got down to the old business that was new because someone had named it: the smell had been showing up where it wished, and the water had been carrying it where it had never had the intention to go, and the glass had been reflecting it with a vanity it thought of as helplessness, and the below-rooms had been flattered by the attention and then sickened by it in a sequence anyone who has ever been complimented recognizes. Leif produced a sheaf of reports bound with a string he had been saving for a celebration that kept not arriving, and the sandy-haired girl added notations about drains that choked, and Lyra arranged the bowl of dirt closer to the edge of the table so that people who could not bring themselves to breathe could look down and be instructed by the sight of something reasonable.\n\n\u201cIt is not only her,\u201d Marin said when the murmurs began to do that thing murmurs do when they have convinced themselves they have labored into a conclusion. \u201cDo not point with your noses and call it proof. It\u2019s bigger than a person. The Culvert knocked because she taught it a new rhythm, yes, and then it knocked on its own because thresholds love attention like anyone. But this\u2014what we are smelling at odd hours in rooms that have no business being damp\u2014this has another hand on it.\u201d\n\nThe princess stood still as a doorway. The smell around her did not flinch at being accused of ubiquity. \u201cThere is a refinery on the far side of a mirror,\u201d she said in a tone that made Ezra think of train tracks and the certainty with which they proceed. \u201cIt used to bottle sweetness. It bottled it so diligently it forgot to ask where the sweetness came from. Now it does not bottle anything. It was closed by men who insisted it was a profit that had ended. It was not closed properly. The glass remembers, and the pipes remember, and every door that has been allowed to stick instead of oiled remembers. When I moved, the remembering lifted with me because it enjoys a parade.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe art museum,\u201d said the mirror woman with the blade hair, and she tilted her glass so that Marin could see herself turned into an intention. \u201cOur footage did not show the handprints being made in the way you would like evidence to show you its work. Our footage learned a new job. It is possible this refinery has learned how to use polish against us. It is possible the smell has become a mirror that does not need us anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sugar,\u201d Ezra said, and he startled himself by speaking because the room had been allowing him the courtesy of invisibility. \u201cIt\u2019s not metaphorical in the way you mean. It smells like sugar at the edges when it is being proud of itself. It smells like sugar when it\u2019s normal to be proud. And then it smells like a lie. I\u2019ve worked in a caf\u00e9 you would disapprove of because the owner calls coffee \u2018beans\u2019 in a tone that contains a secret handshake, and I\u2019ve burned syrup and had to clean it out of a pitcher. This is like that, but with a family history.\u201d\n\nMarin wanted to kiss his forehead, which would have made four different people at the table cough for different reasons, and so she settled for saying, \u201cHe\u2019s not wrong,\u201d in the way one says about a useful tool one had not admitted to needing. \u201cThe refinery. The glass. The thresholds wanting to be lovers. We are telling one story in here, and the city is hearing eight. If we are not careful, the version the street repeats will be full of words none of us put in its mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you propose,\u201d the knife-smile woman asked, and she asked it like a person who has been betrayed by proposals wearing perfume. \u201cWe cannot right a factory with compliments. We cannot tell a smell to mind its manners and expect it to apologize on paper. We cannot enjoin a story to stop telling itself, not even when it is making a mess on our rugs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can bring you sweetness you cannot resist, if you desire to be instructed by your bodies,\u201d the princess said, and she reached into the pocket of her brine-colored dress and brought out a jar that had never belonged to any kitchen. It was not exactly glass; it had the look of something that had been a river once and had been persuaded to hold a specific shape for a while. The contents were not exactly syrup; they were what happens when a certain kind of attention is allowed to reduce. She set it on the table and the table tilted infinitesimally as if adjusting its own spine to accommodate a guest of honor. \u201cYou will not drink it,\u201d she added, and she smiled in a tired way. \u201cYou will put it in the corners and on the lips of mirrors and at the mouths of drains and on the backs of doors that have decided they will not shut on a Tuesday. It will call to itself, and when it arrives it will be tired and we can teach it to sleep.\u201d\n\nLyra bent to look as if she had been handed a seed the size of a fist and told it contained a grove. She did not reach for it because some jars are still part of their maker\u2019s skin. \u201cThis is sticky with a willingness I have missed,\u201d she said, and the rosemary on the trestle breathed hard enough that a small fog gathered around its needles. \u201cWe will need to teach everyone where to stand while you do this. We will need to tell the city to put its fingers in its pockets and not touch anything.\u201d\n\nLeif\u2019s mouth opened to ask the kind of question men with strings in their papers ask when they wish to avoid appearing to approve prematurely. He didn\u2019t get to ask it. The air near the mirror delegates whitened like breath on hard cold, and for one unpleasant beat the Halfhouse reminded them it had a sense of humor about panic. The mirror woman with the hand glass stiffened and made a small shape with her mouth that made the glass in her hand bow with relief. \u201cThere is a door,\u201d she said, and her even voice went uneven for the space of two syllables. \u201cThere is a door that has decided it should be a mouth. Someone is trying to come in without a knock.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou invited her,\u201d Leif said with satisfaction that should have embarrassed him. \u201cShe is here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not she,\u201d the mirror woman said, and she put her hand up into the air as if proffering it to a horse, and whatever had been thinking of using the air decided to apologize and did not, and then did again because apologies sometimes require practice. \u201cThis is a smell trying to find a face. We will not permit it. It is\u2014oh.\u201d\n\nThe oh contained the kind of awe you normally reserve for the moment a child you had not expected to be musical sits down at a piano and invents a chord that has always existed. The smell that rolled into the room was not the princess\u2019s. It was not courtesy. It was not refinery. It was the odor of sweetness forced and possibilities exhausted, and it tried to make itself comfortable by covering the bowl of dirt with its palm. Lyra said a word that would scorch wallpaper if your grandmother had ever let you say it in her house, and she slammed the dirt bowl closed with her hand as if smothering a small, daring fire.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s using the Halfhouse,\u201d Marin said, and she could feel in her ankle and in her jaw where the room had agreed to hold its ground and where it had been tempted to flirt with collapses. \u201cIt\u2019s using our generosity to pattern itself. It doesn\u2019t have a face; it wants to borrow ours.\u201d\n\nThe princess of Mire\u2019s smile went away like a candle someone hadn\u2019t remembered to be careful with. She stepped around the table as if stepping around a decision. She lifted the jar and unscrewed the lid with a growl of something that had nothing to do with threads and everything to do with having fingers. \u201cWe can stop being gentle,\u201d she said, and she tipped the jar and let a thread of what was not syrup and not light fall onto the edge of the table.\n\nThe Halfhouse uncharacteristically said thank you, which is to say the way the grain misbehaved settled into a better line for a fraction of a breath. The smell that had been playing at being a guest turned itself toward the sweetness as if it had been humming nonsense and suddenly recognized a tune. The thread spread and became a circle the size of a saucer and then a pond not larger than a dinner plate, and the air above it learned a lesson in gravity it had thought beneath it. The smell gathered itself with a kind of offended swiftness. This is the only way to catch a thing that thinks it is a cleverer version of your own mood; you give it what it cannot refuse and then you ask it to show its teeth.\n\nEzra did not breathe because he had learned to treat breath like currency and he liked to be paid for his efforts. He watched the shiny ring expand with the terrible eroticism of caramel hitting cold marble. The mirror women held their glass tilted at an angle that would insult sunlight but flatter any person whose skin refused to be called a surface. Leif\u2019s fingers dug into the underside of his chair because his hands had been idle for too long. The sandy-haired girl had tears on her cheeks that made rings like old pennies when they hit the wood and spread and went shy.\n\nFor one ridiculous moment Marin thought of advertisements, of pictures in old magazines where spills behaved like polite actors and messes limited themselves to photogenic ovals. Then the Halfhouse leaned, the jar in the princess\u2019s hand pulsed, and something at the edge of the sweetness snarled like oil taught to speak and failed to find its consonants. The jar hummed. The table attempted to lift the bowl of dirt with a corner and became embarrassed at the strain.\n\nThe courier from the bookstore stepped out of the wall where it had never been, and her coat hissed with droplets that did not belong to their weather. She did not look around as a person would who had been astonished; she fixed her eyes on the circle of sweetness and her nose wrinkled in a gesture that, on another face, might have been human affection for the antics of a child. \u201cYou started without me,\u201d she said, and her voice had lost nothing of its fencepost strength. \u201cIt would have been politer to wait and less intelligent. Good. Now you will want to stand back.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t knock,\u201d Leif said, because if he did not say something irritable at least once every three minutes of a crisis the beard might choose to emancipate itself on ethical grounds.\n\n\u201cI never knock,\u201d the courier said, and she raised one hand, and for the first time since she had walked into their lives at the travelogues Marin realized that the courier\u2019s hands had been unadorned. There were no rings. There were no scars that made a story you could read without asking. There were only knuckles that knew what wood sounds like when it is lying. \u201cThe refinery did not shut properly,\u201d the courier said without moving her mouth very much, because speech was a commodity in rooms like this and you didn\u2019t spend it on repetition. \u201cThe glass has been persuaded. The thresholds were flattered. You have built a trap with candy. Excellent. Now a suggestion. It will go for the sweet and call itself in, and when it does you must be slower than you want and faster than you fear.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow,\u201d the mirror woman asked, and she asked it with interest and not with fluster because she was tired of the taste of being blamed for the crimes of her kind.\n\n\u201cClose it with something dirty,\u201d the courier said, and she put her two fingers into the bowl Lyra had been protecting as if the dirt could become banished by noticing, and lifted them covered in a paste that smelled like the underside of a rock and the bottom of a pot left too long after beans. \u201cPut the earth on your lip and say no so the room hears it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to lick the table,\u201d Ezra began, and then Lyra had already done it without making it into a show, and her mouth left a dark smear on the bright wood and the room made a sound like a hand clapped over a child\u2019s mouth in a game that had forgotten, briefly, that games can grow teeth.\n\nThe sweetness inhaled as if it had encountered a dare, and the smell collapsed toward it in a spiral Ma rin\u2019s father would have called beautiful and refused to look at because it told him the story of a whirlpool and the end of boats. The jar in the princess\u2019s hand warmed until the air around it shivered. The dirt line tightened its throat. The mirror women tilted their faces like geese aligning for migration as if a wind that had never gone outdoors was moving through the room. Leif whispered something into his beard that sounded like the first half of an apology shaped as an instruction. Marin smelled the rosemary and the soil and the sweet and the old iron of her letter and felt all of them braid themselves into a rope that might hold if they held it correctly.\n\nIt went wrong in the direction that told them they might still deserve luck. The smell poured itself toward the ring as if it had been hoping for someone to command it, and then at the last possible breath it remembered itself and pushed. The jar bucked in the princess\u2019s hand as if offended to be outsmarted by its chosen prey. The floor under the table leaned two degrees toward forgiveness. The sweetness would have spilled if a room like this admitted spillage. Lyra put her palm flat on the smear of dirt and the smear reddened as if blood in another story had reached across to be useful in this one. The courier tasted the air as if it had been brewed and detected notes of coal and cathedral and factory whistle and fear. Marin said no in her mother\u2019s voice because her own voice felt too tired for the job and immediately wished she had not, and then recognized that wishing is a worse habit than lying.\n\nThe circle held. It quivered the way a road quivers in heat when the cars have gone and the street decides it owes no one its solidity. The smell gathered what there was of itself and leaped, the sweetness flared like a decision, and the dirt stole the leap and taught it how to be a wall instead of a window. The ring\u2019s surface went from shine to something that lived between shine and dull and then settled at a texture she would have called skin if she had been telling Ezra a fairy tale and had wanted him to sleep well. The jar calmed. The room took breath. For a moment everyone stood with their mouths slightly open as if they had all forgotten in the same instant they had been sharing air all their lives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in there,\u201d the sandy-haired girl whispered, and no one reproached her for speaking. \u201cIt\u2019s like a bee in a glass. It hates the sides.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pity it,\u201d the knife-smile woman said softly, even as her own mouth wanted to shape the word mercy because words have habits that do not always cooperate with your principles. \u201cIt will not pity you. It does not think the way you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know that,\u201d Marin said, and she did not know why she felt the ache behind her left eye that meant she was about to adopt an unpopular stance out of principle. \u201cWe know it is something that is tired of being unnamed and has discovered that rooms like this allow you to feel like an adult. That makes anyone cruel. Keep your hand on your shoe pin and your thoughts in your head and your sugar off your tongue. We will talk to it when it has learned how to hear.\u201d\n\nThe princess did not look away from the circle, which had begun to emit a smell not unlike a memory of a bonfire in wet weather. \u201cYou always make chairs talk so much,\u201d she said to no one and everyone. \u201cIt is astonishing you get anything done.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou came,\u201d Lyra said, and there was pride in it and not the kind that has to be admired to survive. \u201cThat counts as something.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does,\u201d the courier allowed, and for the first time since anyone had made the mistake of calling her a messenger she showed the habit of humor like a woman remembering she had once had a scarf she loved. \u201cHowever, you have made a jar work in a room that eats jars if they belong to the wrong stories. Now you will keep it from learning that trick. Someone must carry it where you want it to be while this house still thinks well of you.\u201d\n\nEzra\u2019s mouth, which had been determined not to volunteer anyone but himself for anything, beat him to speech. \u201cI can carry a jar,\u201d he said, and he said it the way he said I can close tonight when a friend threw in a text that contained both a request and four different types of exhaustion. \u201cIt is not heavier than a cat and it does not have claws.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has claws,\u201d the mirror woman said, but her smile reached her eyes for the first time. \u201cThey are made of expectation. Yours or its. Be careful which you trim.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will do,\u201d the princess said, and she looked at Marin and then at Ezra and then at the circle as if considering the new geometry. \u201cHe has the right kind of wrists. He has learned not to drop what he thinks he cannot afford to replace. He will smell like this for a month. It will make his ex text him at two in the morning. He will survive.\u201d\n\nMarin felt her ribs attempt to learn a new choreography and decided to let them. \u201cGive us six cloths,\u201d she said to no one in particular and the Halfhouse in general. \u201cNot cotton. Not linen. Something that remembers being a tree but has gotten over it. We will cradle the plate in the box that used to hold cookies. We will walk it where it needs to sit. We will do it before the city notices we have begun and decides to comment.\u201d\n\nLyra produced cloths out of a drawer the Halfhouse was proud of despite their strained relationship with drawers. The mirror women breathed on the glass until the room could see where air wanted to live. Leif took his hands off his knees and put them to work tying the string around the pastry box with the awkward concentration of a man teaching himself a new knot with too many eyes on him. The knife-smile woman took her pin from her shoe and pinned the corner of one cloth to the corner of another because sometimes making a tent for a thing teaches it what obedience feels like before you ask for bigger obedience. The sandy-haired girl said thank you to the jar, and the jar said nothing, and that felt like excellent manners.\n\nWhen the circle was transferred to the lined box and the lid lowered with the tenderness of a grave\u2019s first spade of clean earth, the room shook itself and remembered it had other business. Ezra took the box. He felt the weight with his forearms first and then with his fingers and then with his mind, the way anyone who has carried a sleeping child or a cake or a confession learns that there are different ways to fail to hold something. He breathed in through his nose and frowned, then smiled, because the smell on the box did not make him want to gag. It made him want to put the box down somewhere he trusted and then go stand outside in a patch of sun that might or might not exist. \u201cWhere,\u201d he asked, and he hoped to God someone would say a single street name with a single block and perhaps a landmark that likes cougars.\n\n\u201cThe refinery\u2019s shadow,\u201d the mirror woman with the blade hair said. \u201cThere is a place south where the glass remembers more than it ought. It will admit you if you arrive holding its cousin. It wants to be forgiven. It wants to be used again. It will ruin everyone if we grant it its wish. We must teach it to want something else.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe go now,\u201d Marin said, because the city and the jar and the smell had begun to develop the kind of interest in one another that leads to stubbornness. \u201cNow, before the ferry turns and the tide reminds us who we are.\u201d\n\n\u201cI come,\u201d the princess said, and the room tried to invent a rule that would forbid it and failed in a way that pleased it. \u201cI would like to meet my old enemy on a day when I am clean and wearing shoes. It will not believe itself.\u201d\n\nLeif began to suggest a guard, and the courier looked at him with the flat affection of a woman deciding not to educate a dog. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, and she made the word tender as if speaking to a flame that needed to be smaller. \u201cGuards make doorways bloom teeth. We will go with a boy and a jar and a princess and a woman who knows where to put dirt. It will not think it is a procession. If we carry flags we will be bitten.\u201d\n\nMarin looked at Ezra and he looked at the box and then at her, and in that quick loop of glances was the kind of promise you overhear by accident and pretend not to. He slid one hand under the box, then the other, then rose without bending at the waist because his teacher in the gym class he failed for attitude had been right about the way backs prefer to be treated. He would not be offended by whatever the city decided to call him today. He was a boy; he was a mortal; he was a friend. He was a person a jar could use to get somewhere it had decided it was owed.\n\nThey left by a hallway that had been a kitchen on Wednesday and was a hall of mirrors today, except none of the mirrors insisted on showing them their faces unless asked. The Halfhouse hummed over their shoulders a blessing so old it had forgotten the words and converted itself into rhythm. Lyra carried the bowl of dirt as if anyone watching would think it a centerpiece and not a weapon. The princess of Mire walked without looking to see if anyone followed, the way people do who have been abandoned often enough that they have decided not to look back until the leaving is done.\n\nOn the street the rain had cooled to a fine brush of paint across cheeks and knuckles. The city made them a single long green, and the gulls turned their eyes toward the box and then away, and a bus paused at a red that wasn\u2019t and waited with its heart idling to let them pass. Marin felt the letter in her coat heat and cool and heat again in a rhythm that didn\u2019t belong to this day, and she told it silently to be still, and in a miracle of diplomacy it obeyed. South grew up in front of them like a sentence that intends to be kind and only manages to be efficient. The air changed in ways only people looking for it notice. Ezra had decided to be one of those people for the rest of his life whether or not he survived pastry delivery under duress.\n\nWhen they reached the stretch of street where the glass held long, foolish recollections\u2014an old warehouse converted into offices for people who write instructions for machines that do not need them; the shell of a factory with windows pocked like a tired face; a chain-link fence that had taught itself to sing in wind\u2014they stopped because the stop came up out of the pavement and under their feet. The mirror women lifted their hands not to perform a ritual but the more dangerous act of acknowledging one in progress. The princess took the jar out again without unscrewing the lid and held it up like a lantern no one had been told to be afraid of. Lyra put her bowl of dirt on the hood of a car whose owner would find a ring later and decide it had been left by a meteor and forgive the weather for once.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d the courier said, and she did not point because pointing makes doors vain. \u201cIt is here, where the glass has been trying to pretend it is just windows and has been smuggling a throat into work. Set it at the seam. Not in the middle. Not where you think the story would put it. At the corner. Make it inconvenient. Make it human.\u201d\n\nMarin knelt despite the scream her jeans made for the laundromat. The smell under her hands rose to meet her and then paused out of courtesy, which told her more about the refinery than any invoice would. She touched the seam between brick and metal frame with two fingers that had convinced pipes to love her and felt a quiver like a shock that had been waiting since before she was born. Ezra lowered the box with a care that would have shamed a surgeon. The circle inside showed no desire to be dramatic. It lay there like a lake not yet discovered by people who insist on water skis.\n\n\u201cNow the part everyone hates,\u201d Lyra said cheerfully, and she dipped two fingers in her bowl. \u201cWe dirty it.\u201d\n\nShe smeared a crescent on the top edge of the box where the lid met the side, then another on the lower left corner, then pressed her thumb into the third smear as if to sign a document with an ancient pen. The mirror women held their breath because they liked the way the air felt when it had been used. The princess of Mire laughed once and did not apologize because her laugh was the sound of someone who remembered her jokes and had not been asked to explain them.\n\nThe smell lifted. It leaned. It wanted what was being offered because the sweetness offered something neither apology nor repentance can: employment. The glass in the factory face in front of them shivered. The air behind it gave up a draft as if someone had opened a door in a pantry. Marin put her hand on the edge of the box and whispered her father\u2019s compromise, the one that persuades a pipe to loathe you quietly, and then she said the city\u2019s name and then she said hers, not to introduce herself but to remind the day what name it had agreed to use when requesting her.\n\nSomething came forward that was not a woman and not a machine and not a story and not a city. It smelled like all of them and like the expectation of sugar when your tongue has been promised salt. The jar in the princess\u2019s hand hummed; the dirt in Lyra\u2019s bowl warmed and then cooled like a body thinking. The glass took a breath and decided not to break. Ezra felt his muscles do the thing they do when a train passes under your feet and you pretend you don\u2019t know why you are suddenly steadier. The mouth that was not a mouth touched the lid of the box with the idea of a tongue and then decided to go in.\n\nMarin did not move and did not blink until the hair on her arms requested permission. The circle pulsed and then went flat and then pulled like breath. The smell poured and then did not. The city let the ferry horn be quiet for a beat long enough to make the absence a sound. The refinery\u2019s shadow shrugged and lost an ounce of itself. The jar, for the first time, cooled in the princess\u2019s hand. Lyra wiped her thumb on her apron and discovered she had been weeping on one side of her face and not the other, and decided she would permit that asymmetry as a treat.\n\n\u201cThere,\u201d the courier said, and if she had been a person given to sighing she would have allowed herself one. \u201cYou have taken its vanity away and left it the job. Now you will tell it, over and over, that it is work. It will try to be glory. You will yawn at it until it is bored into usefulness.\u201d\n\nEzra wanted to say that he was very good at boredom and had never expected to weaponize it, but his mouth chose to remain part of his face and he accepted the compromise. Marin stood up and her knees made a bitter poem about their lives. The princess of Mire put the jar in her pocket and it knocked against a small flat stone that had probably been waiting there for a decade for a day like this. The mirror women allowed themselves to look briefly proud. Leif, who had followed at what he believed to be a stealthy distance and what was actually an act of leadership in the wild, stopped chewing on the inside of his cheek.\n\nIt was not the triumph one would hang a portrait for. It was not a victory a statue could bear without looking silly. It was a job done well enough in time and in rain and in the sight of a city that valued mundane miracles because anything less obvious embarrassed it. Marin looked at Ezra and he looked at her and then down at the box like a parent checking to see whether a child had finally fallen asleep, and she felt fatigue roll through her all the way to the ankles where thresholds like to write their notes.\n\n\u201cBack,\u201d she said, and the word in this context meant not only to the Halfhouse but to the living, to the business of bringing people paper in a bag and telling them you had been out of their favorite magazine for three weeks and you were sorry and you had ordered it special and this time it might come. \u201cWe go back. We bring it to a table that will not forget why we brought it there. We do not congratulate ourselves until something worse happens, and then we will regret not congratulating ourselves, which is a funny joke the city likes to tell.\u201d\n\nThey started walking, and the light did the city\u2019s old trick of changing in a way that made people believe the day had more hours than it ever does. The box was so much lighter in Ezra\u2019s hands he resented it for not respecting his effort, and then forgave it, which is to say he forgave himself for being the kind of man who wants objects to admire him. The princess of Mire\u2019s smell now had the decency to stick close to its source unless called, and the rosemary in Marin\u2019s collar had decided to turn from green to a dim, private silver that smelled like a good grudge more than a good plan. By the time they reached the vending machine that wasn\u2019t, the gulls had adjourned to find new arguments, and the only person watching them was a boy of seven who had been told not to lick the railings and had already licked them and was worried three different myths might be true. He sniffed, frowned, then smiled because the air smelled like something he could describe later when someone asked him what his city had smelled like, and he wanted to have an answer that made his mother say oh and nod.\n\n\u201cWe will have to invite the factory to apologize,\u201d the mirror woman said when they paused in the door to be greeted by a room that had learned the difference between respect and fear. \u201cIt will be awkward. It will want to send a letter through three hands and pretend it wrote no words in the margins. We will make it stand and use its own throat. You will all wish to burn something. Try not to choose me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one here is arson,\u201d Lyra said, and she set the bowl of dirt on the table where the jar had made the wood remember how to be good. \u201cBut some of us enjoy matches. We can take turns holding them without striking.\u201d\n\nThe princess of Mire put her hand on the table and left a clean, invisible print that the wood pretended not to feel. \u201cTomorrow again,\u201d she said, and there was no drama in it, which made it feel like prophecy. \u201cUntil the city learns what we smell like when we are all in the same room and not trying to impress each other\u2019s ghosts.\u201d\n\nMarin reached into her pocket and felt the letter obligingly not bristle at her touch. She thought of her father with his pipes and his pipe jokes, of the shop with its bell and its cat whose opinions would survive the apocalypse unfazed, of Ezra\u2019s scarf trying to be an ocean. She imagined the refinery with its throat clearing and its fear of becoming useful again after such a long rest. She imagined the jar on the Halfhouse table making a small, contented circle against which no one could reasonably rail, and she imagined, despite herself, an apology delivered properly, which is to say by someone who believes he has better things to do and does them anyway but first says he is sorry and means it.\n\nThey sat because you sit when the room allows it, and when Ezra opened the box enough to peek, the sweetness inside looked up and did not glare. It regarded them with the bland interest of a blessing that has not decided how it will be distributed. The smell hovering over it was not beautiful and did not want to be, and this felt like progress. The Halfhouse shifted a fraction to one side, and the ferry horn chose that moment to interrupt, and outside the rain held back as if it wished to hear what words chairs would require next.",

                              "content": "By afternoon the Halfhouse had decided to smell faintly of lemon rinds and wet bread, which is what happens when you clean tables with the same cloth you used to bless them. The jar had been seated in a corner near the suggestion of a window, a square that did not admit weather but remembered it perfectly, and the circle within went on breathing without breathing, an obedient pond refusing to show any faces. People passed it like you pass a stranger with a bandaged hand in a grocery store; you make yourself small and larger at once, you smile if you have the nerve, you do not pretend you have never hurt the same way.\n\nMarin felt the long tired of jobs that become rituals before anyone has drafted their liturgy. She stood with both palms on the back of a chair because this helped and refused to examine why. Ezra, whose arms had decided they were heroic now that the box weighed less, insisted on carrying it the last inch onto its shelf even when it no longer required his nerves. He had developed a way of walking around sweetness as if sweetness carried static in its skirts; he did not want to betray a tiny shock when he brushed against it, because pride that small can ruin a day\u2019s patience.\n\nLeif pretended not to hover. He pretended the way a tree pretends it doesn\u2019t miss the birds in winter. The knife-smile woman\u2014someone finally said her name with a glass-clink of regret, a name that wore syllables like jewelry, Vessa\u2014kept her pin on her shoe and her mouth in a neutral position like a veteran of older ceremonies. The mirror delegates arranged the light so thoroughly you could have taken a picture at any angle and not embarrassed daylight. Lyra watered the rosemary until the pot wept and then turned the plant away from the jar as if shielding a child from the sight of its first adult disappointment. The courier stood where the wall decided to be door-adjacent and practiced, with no vanity, the art of not taking up parts of rooms that did not belong to her.\n\nThey planned the apology with the fatalism of people who know exactness is not a guarantee. The refinery had to be made to speak; this was a consensus built as slowly as a bridge designed by committees. It could not apologize by proxy through the men with clipboards who walk abandoned sites and pronounce them condemned; it could not send a paper letter on letterhead that smelled of dust and lawyer; it could not hire a PR firm to teach its windows the tone of regret. The Halfhouse disliked being addressed by a draft.\n\n\u201cWhat does a factory use for a throat,\u201d Vessa asked, and her voice made room for foolish answers without inviting them to stay for dinner. \u201cIf we call the owner, we will get an apology constructed of money and fear of liability. If we call the last foreman, he will tell us about accidents and the boy who cut his hand on a belt. If we call the night watch, he will fall asleep and we will be accused of keeping men from their rest. We can invite the river and she will say we have never listened correctly to the sound metal makes when it is bored.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe conveyor belts,\u201d Lyra said, and she pressed her fingers together as if squeezing an idea to see if it would leak. \u201cThey were tongues. They told the sugar where to go, and they learned how to be cruel when nobody oiled them, and they were taught to carry and not to refuse. Put grease on the right one and it might remember speech.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrease is a language of its own,\u201d the mirror delegate with the blade hair said, and she turned her hand mirror to look at herself and then at the jar like a friend comparing two outfits. \u201cIf we grease a thing in this room, the room will kiss it and then demand vows. We need to be specific. We should not ask for confessions unless we are prepared to hold them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is another throat,\u201d the courier said, and the room turned because even her interruptions arrived like letters sent registered. \u201cThe boilers. Quiet now, but lonely, and loneliness is rhetoric. They are vessels used to being filled and emptied, and no one has spoken to them since the last foreman kissed one and told it to try not to explode that night. They will apologize, if properly cupped. They will be better at it than any man.\u201d\n\nLeif\u2019s beard looked ready to offer an oath about boilers and the dignity of metal; his hands compromised and arranged papers with the tenderness of a man who mistrusts his temper. Marin let the idea of the boiler settle into her chest and wait there, warm and a little too grand. She remembered, unhelpfully, being ten and pressing her cheek to the hot copper pipes in their house until her father cuffed her lightly and told her some loves can boil your face if you\u2019re not careful. She had liked that hurt for its commitment. She now suspected she had grown into the exact sort of person who cannot be trusted unsupervised around machinery and regret.\n\nThey would go back, then, not to pour the sweetness into a maw and walk away hoping the city would lose interest, but to sit the jar beside a boiler and teach it to be heard. They argued briefly over tools like you argue over names for a cat you have already learned to whistle for; the names slap at each other and the creature ignores them both. Ezra volunteered the wrench he kept under his sink for emergencies that turned out to be philosophical, not plumbing, and Vessa produced an oil can that must have belonged to a cousin in a story she never told. Lyra promised dirt again, because dirt is an argument closer to the ground, and the mirror women offered glass that could be persuaded to echo when echoed into.\n\n\u201cYou should bring something from here that can pass as theirs,\u201d the older woman with the portrait hair said, and she slid a folded cloth from a sleeve with the smooth competence of a magician telling you she was only interested in paying the bill. \u201cA rag. Nothing dramatic. It should smell like people. We are allergic to grandeur in this jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nEzra took the cloth and sniffed it because his body believed in technique before dignity. It smelled like lemon and a thousand fingers, like books carried and put down and carried again. He imagined the rag inside a factory that had taught its dust to stay where it was told and found that imagining less arrogant than he expected. If you bring a touch into a room that has raised itself without being taught, the room might change its mind about what company is.\n\nBefore they parted to gather what they needed, the princess of Mire drifted a step closer to the jar she had fed and frowned at it in a way that did not admit affection. Her dress had taken on a darker green as the day wore itself out; there are fabrics that are worse at lying than people are, and brine does not permit pretense. Her hair, untamed, had made elaborate arrangements around itself. For a breath she looked like someone who had never had to be ashamed to be recognized by her smell, and Marin felt a jag of longing for a reality that had been denied before either of them were named. The princess rested the backs of her fingers near the jar, not touching, and the sweetness inside tilted, one surface molecule at a time, to greet what it thought might be kin.\n\n\u201cYou will not behave,\u201d she murmured, and she was speaking to the circle and to the day and to herself and to every threshold in the room at once. \u201cGood. I have had my fill of well-behaved days.\u201d\n\nMarin slept twice that night, once on her couch and once in the kind of nap you can only have when you resent yourself for taking it. The rain auditioned against her windows and won the part. She dreamed of stairs that changed flavor under her feet, walnut and salt and flour and the lime you touch to a glass to make it more willing. She dreamed of her father leaning under a sink with the confidence of men who love correct wrenches; she dreamed he looked up at her and his face was Ezra\u2019s and then Leif\u2019s and then nobody\u2019s, which unnerved her until she found her own hands in the dream and they were steady. She woke with a sentence in her mouth like a coin: boilers are just hearts you can talk to without anyone accusing you of romance.\n\nThey met without ceremony under a sky so low it had opinions about umbrellas. The refinery sprawled like a lie told by a landscape that thought it could still get away with older fashions. Fences wore signs with warnings that had become performative: no trespass, keep out, private property, the words so polite they had started to beg. The mirror women walked as if they were not walking on anything but their own reflections, which is a neat trick but makes you miss potholes; Lyra watched their ankles and said a prayer to whoever manages the setbacks of the elegant. Vessa wore a coat with a collar high enough to annoy the wind, and she looked like she had ordered weather before and had it corrected. The courier put her hand flat to the fence for a moment to borrow its attention, then took it away again as if to prove she intended to return it.\n\nEzra carried the rag and the wrench and had convinced himself the box should remain behind in the Halfhouse because they had no business bringing dessert into a conversation about atonement. Marin carried the jar not because it was heavy but because it had the gravity of certain kinds of letters. The princess of Mire, shoes and all, walked to the gate, which had learned how to be locked in three languages and twelve padlocks, and set her palm on a square of metal like the way you comfort a dog that never learned to be touched in a way that didn\u2019t hurt. The lock did not melt because this wasn\u2019t that kind of story, and also because metal has its pride. It shivered, however, in a way that told the hinges this was not the day to be stubborn.\n\nInside smelled like men who swore for sport and then learned to swear because it helped the belts believe in their jobs. The sweetness was gone from the air; what remained was its architecture, molasses evacuated, the ghost of caramel, the brittle sugar dust that coats the fillings of teeth long after the pastry has been eaten. You could hear the birds that had braved the rafters and you could hear rain negotiating with broken panes, and underneath was the long, patient breath of machines that no longer have to be good. Marin liked it the way you like a room full of objects that would be grateful to you if you deigned to thank them for their service out loud.\n\nThey found the boiler without finding it. It made a shape in the dark that dark tries to avoid out of respect. It sat like a bishop in a game no one had asked it to join, too big for both the board and the rules, and it waited. When Marin stepped close, heat lived in it still the way warmth holds in a theater after the actors have left because the story has not finished using the room. She set the jar down gently as if seating a guest you were not sure would like your friends and put her hand to the old iron, and its skin leached a cold into her palm that had decided to be an opinion.\n\nLyra pushed up her sleeves and laid a thumbprint of dirt on the rusted flange where two pipes met, then another on the spot where someone once scratched his initials without admitting to himself he wanted to sign his life. Vessa tipped oil onto a hinge that had no hinge work left and watched the metal think about it. Ezra tucked the rag in a seam low on the facing and realized with a start he was tucking a child into a bed in his head, and then decided not to confess this because he could feel the boiler\u2019s dignity bridle at being made into a cradle. The mirror women angled their glass so that light pooled on the plate with the manufacturer\u2019s letters, a name no one had said aloud in this city in thirty years popping up like a fish for a fly.\n\nMarin leaned close enough she could feel her own breath return to her, warmed by iron that had opinions about other opinions. She did not ask the room for permission to start. She said the name of the factory\u2014not the proud one on the spiral-bound calendars of the 1970s, but the older, dirtier one that workers used to tell their wives where they would be late, the name with a swear nested in it like a baby bird in a wreath. She said her name; she said the city\u2019s. She said, with the extraordinary calm of someone willing to be ridiculous, \u201cWe are here for the apology, and we are not leaving until you show us where you keep your throat.\u201d\n\nThe boiler did nothing that would convince a camera. Cameras have always been so greedy for the wrong proofs. It waited. Then it decided to practice a new trick: it gave back the sound of rain, but only the syllables the factory had believed belonged to it. It breathed in the word steam without steam. It made a sound like the sleepy cough of a chain. It tried the pitch of a pipe notched by a wrench handle, and somewhere a pigeon on a beam looked up as if told the hour had changed. Vessa did not smile, and this was how Marin knew it mattered.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me beg,\u201d the princess of Mire said, and she stepped into a knowledge of space that the machine could recognize. \u201cWe have both been spoken over enough. The favor is for you as much as it is for the city. You will feel better when you have spoken. Do not expect them to forgive you immediately. Forgiveness makes chairs slouch. We are not opening a school; we are closing a book that was left face down.\u201d\n\nThe boiler accepted a compliment it had not realized contained a demand. It thought about the people who had touched it and given it fear and praise, which is to say people. It considered the first day it had been lit, fed coal by someone who sang badly because he was afraid of thinking, and the last day when a man with narrow shoulders said, fine then, and clanged a door shut he had never believed he would close. Then it did the strange thing asked of it and opened a way for a voice to come through a throat that did not exist.\n\nThe apology did not arrive with grammar. It arrived with heat and with the memory of a gasket, with a sigh that contained graphite, with a pop the room had always forgiven until it had decided not to. You could smell a line of sweetness pushed too far against a red wall. You could hear the scrape of a broom and then the broom being leaned against the wrong pillar. There was a song none of them knew and all of them recognized, the tune men hum when numbers climb to meet their palms. It was not language, and it was comprehension.\n\nEzra\u2019s eyes stung and he told his nose this was not the moment to call him sensitive. Lyra pressed her palm to the iron and pressed back hard, as if reminding the room that bodies are also thresholds that must be considered. Vessa whispered something under her breath that sounded like sorry and not like defeat; she had been the sort of girl who would not permit herself the unevenness of contrition, and you could hear the mature correction in the way she said it now. The mirror women did not catch the apology in their panes in the way you might have hoped; the apology refused to be framed and in that refusal was its veracity.\n\nMarin felt the moment the words had enough shape to be named. She did not translate. Translation is often the polite version of theft. She listened like the bay listens when foghorns talk to each other: with patience that is not infinite, with courtesy that is not naive. When the machine finally found its own small grammar and said enough-no-more-so-sorry in a sequence of sighs and clicks, Marin said yes in a tone that authorized closure without conferring absolution. This is the balance some jobs require, and no one tells you how to get the weight right until you get it wrong in public.\n\nThen the strangest thing happened, which is how she knew it would stick for at least a season. The sweetness lifted from the jar and leaned, not to be dramatic, not with hunger, but to spread itself thin as if to be used properly for the first time since the last jar had been licked clean at a picnic. It laid an edge of itself along the seam of the boiler door, and the metal did not flinch; you can teach iron to like butter if you do it slowly and stop pretending iron and butter cannot be friends. The smell tilted around them and ducked, embarrassed to be observed. The jar cooled the way a teacup cools when you stop asking it to be the center of a conversation.\n\n\u201cThat will do,\u201d the courier said, and this time she did sigh, not because anyone had earned her relief but because bodies insist on their own rules. \u201cNow you will keep it simple. That is your punishment and your prize. Do not turn this into a monument. Do not make speeches until speeches are needed. You will come back once a week with oil and rags and a pail with water that has met mint. You will press your hands to the iron and tell it, I remember. If you cannot do that, all this is a kindness wasted.\u201d\n\nThey did not put a ribbon on the boiler. They did not take a photograph. They stood in a circle stupid with thin triumph and sudden hunger, the kind you only feel after a day you did not know had been practicing to break you. Outside the rain lightened like a mood corrected by a snack. The refinery exhaled and the birds complimented it by not leaving. Through a broken window across the yard, a scrap of paper moved and settled, and if anyone had thought to read it, it would have been an inventory so old it had stopped believing in the things it listed.\n\nBack at the Halfhouse, the circle in the jar had become dull as dried marmalade; this is an insult only to people who confuse shine with purpose. Lyra set the bowl of dirt down and kissed her thumb as if finishing a devout chore. Vessa put her pin back on her throat because shoes are for travel and throats are for arguments, and she had decided to enjoy both in their turn. The mirror women declared, without moving their mouths very much, that the museum glass would be allowed to look at children again tomorrow if no more handprints appeared in footage that had not appointed itself author. Leif did not give a speech, which, for Leif, was a speech.\n\nThey ate the last of the cookies, which is to say Vessa ate one and did not bother to disguise the look of private satisfaction that hovered over her mouth after a salt crystal dissolved, and Ezra took the largest one because martyrdom is a silly habit he tried to keep from getting worse by rewarding it, and Lyra broke hers in half and tucked a piece into the pot of rosemary like a promise. Marin ticked salt into the window tracks in her head because she had not been home to do it and because the city respects plans you make aloud even if they are metaphors.\n\nThe princess of Mire rose when they rose and walked toward the door the Halfhouse had selected as an exit. She paused in the threshold like a woman remembering a name she had been told to stop using when she hit adolescence. She looked back at the jar and at the table and at Marin and then at Ezra and then at the courier and then at the cadres of people with opinions. She did not look at Leif, which was, in its way, a gift.\n\n\u201cThey will start telling a nicer story about me,\u201d she said, and the humor in her voice had a scar on it. \u201cThey will become sentimental, and sentiment is just cruelty with a ribbon. Do not let them. If you hear a child repeat a version of me that makes her the moral for the benefit of a sister, correct with a joke. If you hear a woman invoke me to excuse a damp carpet, correct with a recipe. If you smell me where you do not expect me, draw breath and then ask if you are near a machine that has been waiting to apologize.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will,\u201d Marin said, and she meant it; she felt in her teeth the decision to be irritating for the sake of preventing a lie from becoming comfortable. \u201cCome by the shop if someone throws you out of a meeting. We have chairs no one respects enough to be afraid of, and we have paperbacks we won\u2019t care if you fail to return.\u201d\n\nThe princess\u2019s smile was as private as a mirror turned face-down. \u201cI may,\u201d she said, and she owed no one a better promise than that. \u201cAnd when I do I will buy the book with the woman who eats flowers because no one told her she could eat meat.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe refunds nothing,\u201d Ezra said quickly, because reflex is sometimes love in a hurry. \u201cBut I will hide the good pens.\u201d\n\n\u201cHide nothing,\u201d the princess said, and without warning she leaned close enough that Marin could see the exact place a scratch had scarred her bottom lip when she was small and someone punished a laugh for being too loud. \u201cIf they find what you hide they will decide to be generous about something they should have been thoughtful about. Leave your pens where hands can reach. Teach them to ask.\u201d\n\nWhen she was gone the room became, for a breath, ordinary in the way an emptied church is ordinary: wood and air and the suggestion of knees. Marin felt an ache in the places of her body that thresholds prefer to mark, the ankle and the jaw and the soft under the ribs, and decided to treat herself the way she treats pipes; she would flatter her bones into cooperating. She gathered her bag and the map, which had softened because it liked being consulted, and the letter, which had decided to stop sulking and reclaim its habit of making itself heavier when ignored. Ezra took the empty pastry box and the rag and declared he would take the rag home and wash it and return it, a vow that made Vessa widen her eyes in theatrical awe at his bold commitment to domesticity.\n\nThe city, as a reward for the apology that had been made in a language it understood even if it would never call it that, let the clouds tear themselves into strips so that the sun could play at releasing scenes it had had in storage. On the walk back up the hill a man practiced saxophone in a doorway and his notes weren\u2019t sure whether they preferred the minor or the major, which is what a life is like when it has not yet been pinned down by rent. A woman hauled two grocery bags past them with arms that could have lifted the elevator in Marin\u2019s building if she had been asked to, and she nodded at them like people nod at a weather change they have chosen not to shout at. A bus knelt for a stranger and then broke up the kneel with an embarrassed cough. When they passed under the viaduct\u2019s absence the air moved with relief or ghost memory; it is impossible to tell the two apart unless you are a city and can afford to be wrong in public.\n\nSel was unimpressed by apologies and ritual and men with narrow shoulders pretending to be building managers at gates. She sniffed Marin\u2019s ankles and sneezed and then demanded a piece of the last cookie, and when Ezra tore her a sugared corner she accepted it with the hauteur of queens who have trained courtiers not to offer twice. The shop, in their absence, had rearranged no one, which is the best you can hope for when you stop minding something for an afternoon. The bell over the door made a series of questioning notes and then forgave them for not answering it with a poem.\n\n\u201cDo we put a sign in the window that says \u2018Apology Accepted,\u2019\u201d Ezra asked while he pried at the staples on a box so he could flatten it properly. \u201cOr do we call it \u2018Apology Noted\u2019 so we can reserve judgment when the factory tries to become a gentrified haunted house with a tasting room.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe put a sign that says \u2018Now Hiring: Honest Regret,\u2019\u201d Marin said, and she took down the sticky note on the register that said Must Remember to Call Trash Company and turned it over to write on it so it wouldn\u2019t feel it had failed. \u201cResponsibilities include: not pretending you are a hero when you are simply a machine. Benefits: fewer head colds.\u201d\n\nThey opened for an hour because it made them feel like they were not saving the world, which is a burden best refused unless you are a god with a sense of humor. An old man with an umbrella that smelled aggressively like a cupboard bought an almanac from 1998 because he wanted to remember the dates of rains that had not kept their promises since. A couple ordered the same book at the same time and then laughed and pretended they had not been surprised by the coincidence; Marin wrapped the books without commenting because some punches never land as sweetly if called. A girl with glitter nail polish bought a field guide to ferns and a romance with a woman on the cover who could have been her grandmother; she slid her last two crumpled dollars across the counter and said keep the change, which was five cents, and Ezra took the coins and said he would.\n\nIt was both a quiet night and not. South, near the old factory, windows made the sound windows make when they decide there\u2019s no point in rattling policy into patience anymore. West, over the bay, the ferry horns tried out new jokes on the fog and the fog refused politely and laughed later in private. Under the city, in the culvert, the mouths stayed extra awake and practiced saying the names of people as if they were allowed to love them without being punished. In the Halfhouse the jar slept like any animal that has been told it will be asked to be good tomorrow. Upstairs, in Marin\u2019s apartment, the rosemary kept its counsel and then offered it at midnight to a room that had not asked.\n\nShe did not expect to cry when she washed her face, and she did not. She did not expect to pray, and she did not. She stood at the window and watched the blue neon down the block blink with less neurosis and felt the way her chest made room for this ragged, small victory. She wrote three sentences on a postcard she would not send to anyone\u2014the addressee has a habit of abandoning his address\u2014and set it under the jar she used for pens so that it could teach the pens to be braver. She let the city put her to bed because sometimes she can admit without drama that the streets hold her better than a person might.\n\nThe instructions the letter gave in the morning were simple enough to irritate her. Hold the room. Open the door. Listen when the glass says it would like to be useful. Teach the children that guilt is not a spice you can stir into a cake to make it rise. Bring sugar only when you mean to remedy bitterness. Do not excuse incense. Use soap made of the kind of oil grandmothers love. When it began to list recipes she laughed aloud and the sound made her kettle believe it had been included in something important.\n\nAt the Halfhouse the council arrived with their chairs and their grudges weeping little salt droplets at the corners. Vessa had brought a ledger and a pencil and had tied her hair back with string the color of forgiveness in a picture book. The mirror women had polished nothing, which was how you knew they were determined. Lyra\u2019s apron had been mended in two new places and her hands refused to be anything but honest. Leif had come with a man whose face had never quite finished choosing whether to be handsome or kind; he wore a jacket that had used to belong to someone who spoke under the boilers when he thought the steam was listening. The courier had a smear of dirt on her cheekbone that made Ezra think of women who fall asleep in trains and fold their bodies around packages the way cats curl their tails.\n\n\u201cSomeone has been telling a new story in the market,\u201d Vessa said without preamble, and in her voice was the brittle good mood of a woman who would prefer not to know the answer to the question she is asking. \u201cIt is about a princess who smelled so bad she made all the boys cry, and the moral is that you have to wash until you are liked or the city will spit you out. I don\u2019t intend to arrest children for repeating it. I do intend to ask whose grandmother or uncle taught them, because that\u2019s where infections start.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s coming with the fish,\u201d Lyra said, and the disgust in her mouth was almost a compliment to the fishmongers\u2019 skill. \u201cTourists repeat what the men shout. Some of the men are old enough to know better. Some are young enough to think they invented bravado. I will bring them rosemary and speak as if I am a sailor in their language and see if they blush.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe glass has behaved all morning,\u201d said the mirror woman with blade hair, and her neutrality was almost a kindness to the room. \u201cWe have asked it to practice reflecting clouds and teenagers learning to regard their faces as arguments instead of insults. It excelled. One of our sisters refuses to take off her scarf because she believes the refinery wants her hair. We have given her cinnamon sticks for her pocket. It is possible the refinery wants everything. We are capable of the word no.\u201d\n\nLeif\u2019s guest cleared his throat like a bench deciding it can support one more person after all. He set his hand flat on the table and looked at no one in particular as he said, \u201cI was there the day they shut it. I took a oval tin of cough drops from a locker and never owned another piece of that place. I think about the time we pitched in to buy someone a cake when his child graduated because you\u2019re supposed to do that when families accomplish things as if they are not the field team of coincidence. I don\u2019t care about your jars or your ladies in the wall or the way the floor makes me feel like I\u2019m standing on a piano key, but I can help you keep the apology from getting cheap. Don\u2019t let them take pictures. Don\u2019t let them talk over the machines when the machines try to speak again. Don\u2019t let sugar become charity. I have a shirt that still smells like caramel after three decades. I\u2019ll bring it here so we can remind the room why it\u2019s learning to tolerate sweetness.\u201d\n\nMarin watched a faint light look for his shoulders to sit on. It found them. It looked no more dramatic than putting on a jacket and also changed the weather around his head by one degree. She wanted to thank him and did not because this would have made him a statue in a life that had not forgiven him for needing statues. She opened the map that was not yet pretending to be a map and smoothed its corners, and when her palm ran across the ink she felt the tug of five other rooms waiting their turn. The city had a list; the city always has a list; each item would become a story if they let it, and stories become jobs when people are tired.\n\nSomeone had to mention the market boys and the new version of the princess. Someone had to suggest a counter-story. Someone had to say, in a reasonable tone, that making a good story cheap is the way you win elections and lose your soul. The older woman with the portrait hair suggested fliers tucked into bouquets: recipes for cleaning perfumes out of curtains and the names of women who had lived their lives without granting anyone the rights to their smells. Lyra offered to barter fern starts for a promise not to chant rhymes about girls into the backs of tourists\u2019 heads. Ezra volunteered to fold pamphlets because his hands were built for making paper behave. Vessa said she would walk the market and glare at the loud and flirt with the loud if that would help, because some women do not believe in letting men decide what counts as a tool.\n\nThey were still arguing about whether children should be bribed with licorice or kindness when the Halfhouse did the thing it had not done in months: it rang. It rang like a bell that had been stolen from a church that never existed and then recovered with a dramatic note pinned to its clapper. The sound trembled wood and nerve; the floor leaned into the rhythm like a room remembering dance in a century that had outlawed it twice. The mirror women put their hands to their hair out of instinct. Leif froze and then arranged his face into leadership. The courier\u2019s mouth did not move, which is how Marin knew they were about to perform for an audience that had been in town a long time without being seen.\n\nThe door did not open because the Halfhouse would never be so obvious. The air in the middle of the room learned to pretend it was a threshold and then became one out of embarrassment. Through it walked one person everyone knew and one person no one did. The first was the mayor, which is to say a woman whose job was to convince a city it could be treated like a person for four-year intervals; she had rain on her collar and a smile that was tired and too bright but still hers. The second was small and old and wore an orange knit hat and a coat that had been one coat until time inserted another and they had learned to share a zipper. The old woman carried something wrapped in a towel, and when she set it on the table you could feel a room demean itself by leaning forward.\n\n\u201cThis belonged to my mother,\u201d the old woman said when no one had yet asked, because she was not interested in being made to answer questions in an order that suited the egos of committees. \u201cShe stole it from a shelf in the office when they were supposed to be afraid of the supervisor. He was a small man with clean hands. He would have married me if I had wanted that. I did not. I liked the way the kettle sounded without him. Inside is the name you wouldn\u2019t say. I brought it because the water in my building kept smelling like a sick pantry and nobody downstairs believes me when I call.\u201d\n\nShe unfolded the towel and lifted a ledger bound in cracked blue cloth. The room took a breath in the way it had been taught by people who think rooms cannot possibly mind manners. The book had an authority only objects earn when they have absorbed years of breath and ink and the hot breath of men who have bragged and the cool breath of women who have said their daughters\u2019 names over lists. Marin touched the cover and felt the pop of a dozen broken belts and a funeral that had been postponed twice and then cancelled because the man was not dead at all but living in a hotel in Tacoma with a woman who asked fewer questions. The ledger smelled like sugar if sugar had been read to sleep.\n\nThe mayor, to her credit, saw the jar and did not pretend she had arrived for any reason other than the smell and the letter on Marin\u2019s table in her office. She had the neat expression of a woman who denies herself fear for the good of the committee and then allows herself three seconds of panic in an elevator between floors. She nodded to the jar, to the rosemary, to Vessa\u2019s pin and Lyra\u2019s dirt, to the mirror women like a name-dropping friend confiding she\u2019d always loved glass in summer. Then her eyes found the princess of Mire, who had not stood when the bell rang, and the mayor\u2019s smile changed into something that was not for cameras.\n\n\u201cI used to be the girl who always smelled like pool water,\u201d she said, and you could hear Seattle in the pitch of her vowels, the way this city says sorry with sarcasm because apology is a coat it wears only to church. \u201cMy mother put lemon in my hair and the teacher moved my desk. I am extraordinarily grateful you came to a meeting I did not call.\u201d\n\nThe princess lifted her chin the way a person does who refuses to see flattery as anything but architecture. \u201cDon\u2019t do the thing,\u201d she said pleasantly, and the whole room felt the mercy of her tone. \u201cDon\u2019t connect your childhood to mine for free. You may connect it later, if you work. Now sit. Your knees sound like someone else\u2019s weather. You can add it to your next speech.\u201d\n\nThe mayor sat. The old woman opened the ledger and turned, with the slow correctness of a librarian who has coached her grief into the shape of tidiness, to a page where a sugar stain had curled the paper into a coastline. There, in black ink that had learned how to turn blue with time, was the name no one wanted said aloud. It looked harmless in cursive. It looked like any other noise we have taught to sit like a dog. Marin did not say it. The princess of Mire did not say it. The courier, of all people, said it under her breath with the poise of a person who uses proper nouns like hammers and not cups.\n\nThe Halfhouse did not flinch. Perhaps it did, and then made a decision to lie convincingly. The jar did not flare. The smell tried, faintly, to show off and then remembered that rooms like this burn show-offs for warmth and learned to be shy. The name stirred the ledger and the ledger stirred the room and the room moved a hair toward a kind of future that would make nothing of a spin and a belt and a woman carrying a towel.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d Vessa said, and her pencil hovered over backlash as if out of obedience to an old craft. \u201cNow that we have a proper noun and a bookribbon of regret on the map, we can do a thing that men will mistake for a party and then be alarmed by when it becomes a community. We will take apologies to the places that need them. We will stop asking the city to carry them home. We will teach the smell to stay in the jar unless it is invited to go to work. We will not purchase incense, and if anyone offers me a sachet I will put it under my heel.\u201d\n\nEzra passed the rag to the old woman because he had the sudden, ridiculous thought that she had been promised something soft by no one for a long time, and she took it like a woman who knows softness is often a code. Marin asked the ledger if it would like to come home with her and felt it consider the bookstore shelves the way a dog considers the lap of a person who never learned where the lap begins and ends. Lyra invited the mayor to touch the rosemary; the mayor did, and the plant softened because women who kiss their daughters on the head when they smell like chlorine are powerful. The mirror women tilted their own faces down to look like ordinary people for three lovely seconds.\n\nThey had, before the jar, before the refinery, before the culvert, agreed to the Summit because it had sounded like a word that might persuade bad people to dress well. After, they knew it would be a family argument with dirt and knives and cookies and the frightening possibility of new rules. Marin felt the letter in her pocket spin a syllable like a coin on a bar. She thought of the boys at the market and their rhymes. She thought of the boiler that had learned to be ashamed without being destroyed by it. She thought of the smell that had not obeyed and the sweetness that had nurtured itself into something useful. She wondered whether she would be the person to hold the room together or the one who had to leave halfway through to take a call from a drain that had decided to be a garden.\n\nOn the way out to find lunch that would not taste like work, Ezra pulled his scarf up against a wind that had decided to put on its spring personality early and said, as if remarking on peaches, \u201cThey will want to put the jar in a museum.\u201d\n\nMarin pictured a plinth and a plaque and a child who would learn to press his face too close to the glass to see if there was a reflection hidden in the sweetness. She pictured a docent explaining what rot is using a PowerPoint that had been designed by a bored man in a beige building. She pictured a teacher reminding students not to use their mouths unless calling on. She pictured the smell practicing tricks for twelve-year-olds and being rewarded with applause like a dog that would prefer to be a wolf.\n\n\u201cWe will not let them,\u201d she said, and she took his hand to stop the sentence from going any further out into the rain. \u201cIt\u2019s a jar. It\u2019s a job. We have had enough of altars to our own competence. If we must admire something, let it be a wrench.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet it be your ankles,\u201d he said without thinking, and then he flushed because sometimes he outwits his own mouth and loses graciously, and she laughed properly for the first time since the culvert, a tearless, bellied sound that made a woman across the street in a coat the color of ponds look up and grin for the whole city.\n\nThey walked into a day that had become the kind you do not need to please because it has decided to please you by accident. The two gulls who had been waiting at the rail the day this started were on duty again, their black eyes soft with the satisfaction of birds who enjoy a front-row seat at a human error. They shifted politely to make room for an old man in a cap that carried the name of a ship he had crewed in his sentiment. The ferry exhaled and held still. The pipes beneath their feet were not quiet and would not be, and no one in that room or any other would succeed in silencing them for long, and this, Marin thought, was the point and the prize and the best argument she had for complicating her life this way until someone told her to stop.",
