The first time Rill touched the can, the metal hummed. Not loudly, not the way a guitar string quivers against a stage light, but soft, deep down, as if the aluminum remembered being mountain and moonlight. The can said, in its way, take me back, and Rill did. Their fingers were quick, ink-splattered with sap and charcoal dust, nails dirty from old town brick and river rock. They worked without being seen—most sprite-work is like that, the invisible choreography that turns one city into another between blink and bus schedule.

At dawn in Fort Collins, the buildings yawned as if they had mouths and the cottonwoods were gossiping. The Poudre lay in its cold groove, whispering numbers Rill listened to when they needed to steady themselves: 31 degrees, 48 breaths, 9 canoes that summer had been, 13 years since a flood. They let the river count for them. They liked counting, they liked systems, they liked the way things clicked into place when you turned them in the right light.

They were not tall. Sprites rarely are. But they had a way of filling a sidewalk, a bike lane, the lip of a trash barrel, so that whatever you were carrying felt a little heavier, and then lighter, and then suddenly you were walking three blocks out of your way with your empty bottle to find a bin with a blue lid and an open heart. Rill’s work was not glamorous, which is to say, it was necessary. And it came with skills they didn't much advertise.

They could hear polymer chains, for one. Nylon sang like bees. PET murmured in a voice like a librarian with secrets. HDPE was a bassoon, mellow and forgetful. Rill could sniff out a recycling plant by the way the air tasted like penny and raincloud. They could make machines twitch—just a little—when machines were being stubborn. If a soda machine at CSU swallowed someone’s quarters and refused to give up the can, Rill could stand under the fluorescents, squint, and the thing would cough up not one but two, sometimes three, as if embarrassed. Their favorite trick was with the magpies. They ruled the magpies. The birds were the gossip wire of the city, black and white and curious, chattering like static. Rill fed them aluminum pull tabs like communion wafers, and in return the magpies brought them news: a bin behind a brewery overflowing with cans, a compost heap gone wrong behind a restaurant, a boy sitting alone on the edge of Horsetooth Reservoir with a bright red plastic pail hanging from his wrist. The magpies told Rill who needed looking after and which corner had turned sour.

That morning, their breath made little ghosts in the air. It was still early enough that the neon in Old Town was blinking like someone learning Morse code. Rill had a pack of strings and nets slung over their shoulder and a small knife with a handle made of oak. They had plans. They always did. A list tucked into their sleeve, written in an alphabet only sprites used—leaves and punctures, dots and short cuts that meant “vineyard,” “pizza place,” “nurse’s break room,” “the mouth of the creek where small hands throw big things.”

They were standing on Linden, outside the place with the brushed concrete and the copper letters that caught sun like a wink, when a human voice said, “I can see you.”

Rill froze. The wind picked up and put its mouth over theirs in case they needed telling to keep quiet. A bicycle rolled past, whirring, a dog sniffed the corner of the lamppost and sneezed. It took Rill a heartbeat, two, to realize the voice was not saying the forbidden thing—what are you?—but just listing a fact in the way children do when the sky is a fact and their shoelace is a fact and the existence of tiny people in the cracks between bricks is no more or less surprising than anything else.

The child stood with a backpack. He had dark hair that refused to commit to a part, a shirt with a planet on it, and eyes that made Rill think of toddy cats—not because of the shape but because of the alertness. He held out a hand. He didn't try to touch. He just showed Rill his palm like someone talking to a deer: an empty gesture that says I have nothing to hide.

“Do you.” Rill didn't move, but their voice had a smile that could be read if you knew how to read voice.

“The magpies told me to look,” the boy said, solemn. “They took one of my chips and then dropped it on my head, so I looked, and I saw you, last week, by the statue. You were moving those straws. My uncle says I shouldn’t run because my knee, but that is not about magpies, but it is important.”

“Everything is important if you put it in a pocket with the right stones,” Rill said. “What’s your name?”

“Mateo,” he said. “I will be eight in winter.” The precision was refreshing. Sprites like exactness and the play of it. Time, too.

“I am Rill,” Rill said, and waved the can as if it could wave back. “You can really see me?”

“I can see you because my abuela says if you stare at where the shadow is not, you can see things hiding in the edges of the air.” He shrugged. “And because I dropped my glasses and I’m still trying to pretend I don’t need them.”

Rill admired the audacity of that statement. The world is full of people pretending they don’t need the tools they need. “I’ve got work, Mateo.”

“I will not stop you,” he said, immediately stepping back. “I only want to know—are you the one who put the blue baskets at the game? My best friend put a hot dog in it by mistake and he cried because the sign said no food, only bottles.”

“I might have suggested baskets to the wind,” Rill said. It was their way. Whisper an idea to the desert of the mind. Sometimes the idea landed somewhere else and came back wearing a human’s voice.

“My mom said she likes your baskets,” Mateo said. “She says she likes your city more than the one by the highway.”

Rill glanced at the horizon where the highway ran like a silver scar. “Tell your mom she’s part of the reason it’s nice.”

“Okay.” Mateo hesitated. “Do you have... an enemy?”

The magpies laughed from a wire, sharp little needles of sound. Rill raised an eyebrow. “What kind of question is that for a person you only just met?”

“The kind you ask when you’re reading a book and you think if you turn the page the person will already be in trouble, and you didn’t ask before, and then you won’t know what to do.” Mateo shifted. “Abuela says all heroes have to have an enemy or else the story doesn’t move, and then we just sit at the table eating dry bread forever.”

Rill considered the boy carefully. The sun was climbing over the rooftops now; Old Town was putting on its smile, the one with coffee ingrained in it. “There’s someone who wants what I want,” Rill said slowly, “but in the opposite. There’s someone who takes what is whole and un-wholes it because it is easier. Because it is a shortcut. Because it makes them feel like the biggest window on the street.”

Mateo nodded. He was doing the thing children did: listening with their forehead. “Do they have a name?”

Rill did not say. Names have weight, and to drag them through someone else’s morning seemed rude. They had many names for their opposite in their own mouth, some of them rude, some of them poetic. On bad days they said Trash-king, and on the days when they remembered their manners they said, simply, Grack.

Grack had lived in the city longer than any of them. It was not that he didn’t recycle. Even that would have been less annoying than Grack’s particular brand of insistence. He believed in accumulation. He believed in the altar of not-caring. He liked to say that nature makes trash all the time. Leaves, dead wood, apple cores. He believed the difference between a leaf and a fast-food bag was only time, and time is a thing sprites understand too well to abuse. Grack could stop time, in a way, in a block. He could freeze a street corner under a tarp of neglect until weeks later someone said, “Has that always been like that?” and it had. He had a way of slipping into the cracks and making them bigger. Rill’s mouth tasted like burnt sugar when they thought of him. He wasn’t a villain the way villains are in the storybooks, with moustaches and cat laughter, but he had the exact same effect.

“Anyway,” Rill said, “I’ll be fine. You’re late.”

“For what?” Mateo asked.

“For whatever you pretend you’re not late for,” Rill said, and waved him off. He went, reluctantly, the way children leave the edge of magic because the tether is love and that’s the only tether worth being tugged by. The magpies watched him and then pecked a napkin into strips like a calendar.

Rill moved. They moved the way water does when it forgets to make noise. They checked bins. They made a tiny web between two bike racks to catch stray flyers and discard them gently. They whispered to a lopsided sandwich board and it straightened its shoulders. They knocked on the glass at the place with the succulents, and the woman watering the spiky plants sneezed and laughed on a phone call and said, “I’m allergic to my future.” Rill smiled. It was good to belong to a place that did not know it belonged to you.

The magpies brought a rumor late in the morning, over by the tracks. “Rill,” said a bird that had a feather out of place like a thought you cannot smooth. “There’s something wrong at the white building. The one with the metal mountain inside.”

“The MRF,” Rill said. Materials Recovery Facility. The pulse of the city, the place that took rubbish and decided if it wanted to be matter again, organized, purposeful. “Wrong how?”

“Your people are there,” the bird said. “Our people. And not-our people. The conveyor belts have hiccups. There are hands where hands should not be.”

Rill didn’t waste breath. They sprinted. Their feet barely touched the ground. They ducked through a chain-link fence like it was stitched for them, skittered behind dumpsters and pallets, and there it was: the large white building, the hum inside it like a hive too close to summer. Human trucks came and went, reversed with beep-beeps, their drivers sipping coffee, listening to news about drought, about elections, about a new restaurant opening on College with cocktails served in jam jars. The MRF had a smell that was part hot plastic, part paper pulp, part hope. Rill loved it. They slid inside through an obliging crack near the ground.

Sprites were there. Of course they were. There is sprite-work everywhere humans lay down systems. They were on catwalks like ghosts, leaning over the belts in their patched coats and their safety vests that glowed because they liked the color. There were old ones with faces like bark and young ones who had learned to run on rollers without falling. Rill spotted Granite—older than most, stalwart, a jaw like foothills.

“Your ears must be burning,” Granite said instead of hello. The conveyor belt rattled behind his voice, a river of things. He gestured with a thumb at a knot of sprites by the control panel. “We thought you’d sniff your way here.”

“What’s going on?” Rill asked, not wasting time on the affectionate swears that usually preface such a reunion.

Granite’s mouth thinned. “Someone’s been tagging bales with the wrong codes.”

“That happens,” Rill said. “New hires. Sleepy eyes. Plastic looks like plastic until it doesn’t.”

“Not like this,” Granite said. “This—look.”

He led Rill to the panel, where a laptop imported a blue cascade of numbers and RFI tags. If humans had looked they would have seen nothing but a worker glancing at a screen. If they had looked harder they might have seen a flicker of color that did not belong to any spectrum they knew. The sprites saw everything. The codes were wrong, wrong in a way that was deliberate. It was small—one letter inverted, a sequence offset by a single beat. But it meant bales of crisp clean aluminum were being mislabeled as contaminated. It meant the trucks were turning left instead of right at a decision tree. It meant the city would lose money, reputation, momentum. It meant the next time someone argued at a council meeting that the whole thing was a sham anyway, they would have examples. The kind of examples that stick.

Rill reached out and let their fingertips hover over the screen. The characters quivered at the suggestions of contact like minnows. They listened. Numbers have sounds. 3s are sturdy like stepstools. 5s are chatty and unreliable. The wrong codes had a hiss to them, a slither. The sound of someone going “pssst,” someone trying not to be caught.

“Who?” Rill asked, as if the letters would confess. As if a font had guilt.

Granite’s jaw flexed. “Him.”

Rill didn’t need the assent of pronouns. They felt the air like someone had untied it. Grack’s flavor was there: lazy and mean, an unhappiness he wore like perfume.

“How?” Rill asked. “He hates systems.”

“Which makes him very qualified to break this one,” Granite said. “And he’s been busy. See there?” He pointed down the line to where a bale’s straps had a band of something woven into them. It wasn’t string. It wasn’t ribbon. It was film plastic cut thin, then braided, stronger than it had any right to be. It anchored a corner of the bale like a story anchors the wrong moral.

Rill went down. They used the ladder like a suggestion. Hands above them clapped as if they were the kind of person who wants to be clapped for. They paused at the bale. The film plastic looked like an invitation. They didn’t touch it. “Don’t,” said a voice to their left, a whisper turned into a word. It was Tansy, small and quick, always a step away from humor. She had a smudge of ink under her eye and a tattoo of a leaf on her wrist.

“I wasn’t going to,” Rill said.

“You were,” Tansy said. “I know that look.” She tapped the braid with a metal pen. “He’s woven in something.”

“What kind of something?”

“You remember when he learned to steal smells? He’s doing that again—this time with heat.” Tansy leaned in, breathed. “If you cut that wrong, it’ll start a smolder. We’ll spend all afternoon putting it out, and by then someone will have photos and a cousin at the paper.”

“I hate him,” Rill said, and immediately compromised and said, “I hate his methods.”

That was safer. Hate of a person drags you into a river you forget how to climb out of.

“It gets worse,” Tansy said. She led Rill back up to the catwalk. “We’ve found his marks where they don’t belong. At the depot, at the fairground, behind the coffee cart on Laurel—he’s been seeding them the way dandelions seed. It looks like an accident, but it’s him.”

The problem with sprites is that they are very good at noticing and very bad at letting go. Rill took a breath. They used their particular skills and not the ones that made a mess. “We can untie the codes,” they said, one hand on the laptop again, not touching, touching only the air above it. “We can clean this. We can undo it. He must have left the back door open. He always does.”

Granite looked at them with pride that was tempered with something like worry. “Do your thing, little river.”

Which is how Rill stood with one foot on a grated stair and the other in the air, one shoulder pressed to a rail, eyes half closed, and began the quiet work of coaxing apart the strands of wrongness. If you’ve never seen a sprite do this, it looks like nothing. It looks like a pause. It looks like waiting for your toast. But inside the pause, doors open and close, passwords remember their original jokes, maps in code turn back and say, oh yes, the northern road is the right one after all. Rill coaxed. They shushed. They apologized to a letter and kissed a number back to its proper place. They had a gift; they had taught themselves most of their gift; they had polished it against the grit of a city that did not always want to shine.

And then, midway through the undoing, a thing rattled in the air that was not the conveyor belt. It had the sound of oil poured onto foil. The wrongness didn’t resist. It complied. Codes clicked neat. The laptop blinked. In the second after that blink, an alarm three rooms away went off. Human alarm. Not of sprites. It was the sound of a system the sprites liked being used against them. Rill lifted their head. Granite swore. Tansy was already moving.

“What is it?” Rill said, though part of them knew, and the knowing made their bones cold.

“Back door,” Granite said. “An actual one. Fire door. Jammed open. Someone called Fire. They’re coming. And do you know what they’ll find? Guess what’s been kindly labeled as contamination and stacked just so near the door where the sunlight makes everything more beautiful for pictures.”

Granite didn’t need to tell them. Rill could picture it: paper bales made to look like trouble, film plastic nestling like suspicious snakes, a line of aluminum winking like a villain in a cartoon. Something would be smoking just enough to look like mismanagement and not enough to be a real threat. The camera loves almost a disaster even more than a disaster. A disaster, you have to mourn. An almost, you can gossip.

“We need to move the bales,” Rill said.

“With what arms?” Tansy said. “Ours? Or the ones the humans will break by accident when they try to help and get scolded for the wrong kind of help? There’s not enough time.”

“The magpies,” Rill said. “We can—”

“You can’t ask a magpie to lift a city,” Granite snapped, not unkindly. “And we’ll look guiltier than we are if we’re caught with our hands on anything.”

Which is how it happens. The feeling of running with your shoelaces tied. The human trucks were already turning in with flashing lights, the tone of the day changing. Rill did what they could in thirty heartbeats. They slid down, slipped behind a bale, tugged a ribbon of the braided film in a way that would unravel the danger without calling attention to the hand that unraveled it, and then stepped back into shadow. They put their face in the shade. The shade put its hand over theirs, soft, like a parent.

“You have to go,” Granite said, appearing at their elbow. “He wants you seen.”

Rill shook their head. “This is my place. I will not be made to leave it.”

Granite’s eyes were a thing Rill had never learned to look away from. Old as riverbed, serious as a court. “You will not help by being here when someone needs to be the one who is not,” he said. “He’ll have set something with your name on it.”

It was ridiculous. First, because sprites don’t do names that way. Second, because Grack was small in his malice and went large only by multiplying smallness. And yet—Rill had learned to make room for ridiculousness. It often turned out to be true.

They couldn’t see Grack. But they could feel the grin somewhere, the certainty of him in the angles where the catwalk met the wall. A dirty trick—Rill had said he liked them. The simplest trick was to make a good person look like a bad one. The real trick is to make the good person try to fix it quickly, desperately, messily, and in so doing, leave fingerprints where there’d been none.

Rill backed up, swallowed fury, swallowed love of the place, swallowed their best instincts, and left the way they'd entered. The chain-link fence admitted them like a mouth that had found its manners. The magpies fell in around them like outriders, sleek bullets with wings. The truck lights splashed the building and made it look guilty.

“Don’t let him have the story,” Tansy shouted after them, high on the metal stairs. “If nothing else, don’t give him the ending he wants.”

Rill ran. And hated running. They ran until Old Town felt old again, until the air smelled like toasted bagels and bicycle chain, until they came up against the wall by the back of the bookstore where someone had lettered in chalk, We are all temporary, so be the good kind. They slammed their palm against the brick and thought, hard toward nothing. When you have a gift, sometimes the most powerful thing you can do is not use it. They let their skill quiet. They did not read any numbers. They did not fix any codes. They did not call any birds. They breathed.

It is, unfortunately, one of the easiest ways to be found.

“Little stream,” said a voice behind them, low, amused, false-mellow like a radio host who knows he’ll never be cut for commercial. “You run and the city runs with you.”

Rill turned. Grack leaned with his shoulder on the opposite wall, in shade, a dark knot in the bright day. He was not handsome, which does not matter, and he was not large, which also does not matter. He had a way of being the corner in any room, the part your eye slides away from. His hair looked like it had been cut by disdain. He was picking at his fingernails, as if they had once been precious and had disappointed him.

“You smell like pennies,” Rill said. They don’t like to give him compliments, even the insulting kind.

He smiled a little. His teeth were ordinary. “You smell like a rulebook left out in the rain.”

Rill didn’t flinch. “Your trick.”

“I didn’t do anything your machines wouldn’t have done,” he said. He had another trick. He could make truth look like a bruise on a lie. “Systems trip. I was there to notice.”

“And while you were noticing, you braided a trap,” Rill said. “You mislabeled. You staged a door for drama and called the press with a voice that did not sound like your own.”

He shrugged, delighted by the inventory. “The photojournalist is a friend,” he said lightly. “We share a taste for spectacle.”

“Why?” Rill asked, genuinely. “You like living here. You eat here. You sleep in the places I tend.”

He looked past Rill, at something only he could see, or something egotistical like his reflection in the glass of the window behind them. “You make order,” he said, as if it were something embarrassing. “You move things along. You move them out. You tidy. And then what? Everything ends up somewhere anyway. You know that better than anyone. You put the cans in a truck and the truck goes away and someone else makes a choice you do not see.”

“Better that than rot over,” Rill said. “Better that than letting everything be a mess because you are bored.”

Grack moved his shoulder away from the wall as if he were unplugging a cord. He stepped closer, and the air cooled a measure. “You think of yourself as necessary,” he said. “It’s adorable.”

“You are required to exist,” Rill said, because the world contains its opposites and this is how it goes. “Someone has to make trouble so the rest of us remember what the opposite looks like.”

Grack laughed. It was a good laugh, a wrong one. A laugh that made nearby windows want to tighten their frames. “I’m glad you think so,” he said. “It’s a service I provide. Today, for example, I provided a reminder that your precious facility is just as vulnerable as anything else. People will be angry. They will argue not about you and me but about themselves. That is the best kind of argument.”

“What do you want?” Rill said, because sometimes the answer to that question is a secret handed to you by accident.

But Grack was not careless. “Oh, little stream,” he said, “right now I want you to feel like your feet aren’t touching anything.”

He flicked his fingers, as if to brush off a crumb. The effect was out of proportion to the gesture. For a brief instant Rill felt the underpinning drop. The vibrations of the city—the ones that tell you where the trucks are, where the bikes are, how many breaths the morning has left—fell out from under their own cadence. The air tin-canned. It was like being turned around three times in a black tent and told to walk straight. Not pain. Not even fear. Disorientation as a tactic. The simplest dirty trick of all, if you can manage it.

Rill put a hand to the wall, blinked hard, and found the count again. The river helped. The river is a metronome if you love it. They steadied. They made their breath an anchor. In. Out. In again.

“You don’t play fair,” Rill said. “You’re proud of it.”

“Fair is a word people use when they want a prize for something they were already going to do,” Grack said. “Look up the pictures,” he added, and nodded in the direction of the MRF, as if Rill kept a screen in their pocket the way a human does. “You’ll find yourself tagged in the comments. The people who want to believe will believe. The people who don’t will have new reasons. I’m doing them a kindness. They love reasons.”

Rill’s mouth arranged itself around anger like you arrange yourself around a chair that is too small. “You set a trap and then you blame the person who didn’t spring it.”

“I set a trap,” he said amiably, “and you did exactly what you do, which is hover within the web of the trap and try to smile it apart. It’s adorable,” he said again. He was generous with that word when he wanted to belittle you.

A magpie dropped like a stone between them, then puffed itself up. “Your feet are crooked,” it told Grack, fiercely, which is the kind of insult birds practice. “Your gaze is a salt lick.”

Grack looked at the bird as though it were something he would step over if he were feeling lazy. “Pretty,” he said, and then, “Shoo.” The bird did not shoo. Birds that love Rill do not shoo on command. Instead it hopped toward him, the foolish courage of faith. Grack moved his hand again, that sleepy gesture, and a piece of plastic—a drinking straw blue as false sky—lifted from the gutter of its own accord. It spun, charmed, and then flicked. The straw tapped the magpie’s beak. The bird jerked back, in surprise more than harm, but it did not like being touched by something dead pretending to be playful. It made a horrible sound and left a feather behind.

It was small, the trick, but it cut Rill more than if he’d crushed a can with his bare hand. “Don’t,” Rill said. Their voice lost its clever. It was a plea, a single word that means more: do not make me your witness and then expect me to act as if I did not see.

Grack bowed. It was a small mockery of a bow, but he was already losing interest in the conversation. That was his other skill: impatience masquerading as control. He liked to think he was the one who ended things. “Run along,” he said. “Go tell your river that you are still clean. You won’t be for long.”

He left. The tone of the air did not change. It never does when Grack goes. He takes nothing with him. He leaves the mess and the laughter and the arithmetic of the cleanup. Rill picked up the feather. Their hands shook. The magpie didn’t mind. It came back, took the feather from their palm, smoothed its own wing with it, as if to stitch the wind back around itself.

“Are you okay?” Rill asked, feeling ridiculous, feeling exactly right.

“Of course,” said the magpie. “We are made of sky. What is a straw to us?”

“A promise broken,” Rill said, and surprised themselves.

They spent the rest of the morning running decoy. They sent a hummingbird with a leaf of truth in its beak to someone at the paper who would at least double check a byline before going to print. They walked the edges of coffee shops and restaurants where word was spreading: Did you hear? The facility is trouble. The city is a mess. The bins are a joke. The arguments went the way arguments go: strangers taking sides like teams when the teams are made up of cousins. Rill slipped into the movement of people and tugged gently on small tides, just enough to nudge a conversation into patience, to make someone say, “Wait, I heard something different,” to make someone else google anything at all instead of repeating a rumor because it felt morally satisfying.

At noon, under the flat triumphant light of Colorado midday, they met Granite and Tansy by the back of a brewery that made a beer named after an animal and served it in a glass that caught the light like it wanted to be washed. The humans were laughing in the way humans laugh when they are deciding to have a good day anyway. Rill sat with their back against a keg and watched a human father show a toddler how to stack a row of coasters as if it were a castle. There is more grace in a pub than you’d think if you watch only the glasses and not the hands.

“We contained the smoke,” Tansy said. “Humans are going to argue about it until they need to be mad about other things. The codes we unriddled before the trucks made bad lefts. We lost money. We gained a story. We’ll see which lasts longer.”

“You’re good at triage,” Rill said, and it was not quite a compliment.

Tansy pulled her leaf tattoo into the light with her thumb the way people cannot stop touching a mark when it matters. “Are you okay?” she asked.

“I’m furious,” Rill said. Then, to be precise, “I’m mortified. He wanted me to run, and I did. He wanted me to be a rumor, and I was almost one.”

Granite nodded as if anger were a tool you might sharpen and hang back up carefully. “We need to get ahead of it,” he said. “He’s going to try again, and next time it will not be a door. It will be something else we will not have time for.”

“I know his pattern,” Rill said. “He makes you spend effort so you are too tired to see the second thing. He makes a small loop and then a bigger loop and then he laughs when we are tangled in both.”

“Then untangle one and ignore the other,” Granite said.

“Which,” Rill said, “is the thing we are not built for.”

Granite smiled without mirth. “Learn it.”

Rill closed their eyes. Inside their eyelids, the city drew itself. It is a gift sprites develop if they live in one place long enough. Here the river. Here the rail. Here the street where they unspooled new bike paths like long sentences. Here the square with the holiday lights that pretended to be trees. The MRF was a white rectangle with a pulse, wounded but beating. Grack was a shadow that pretended it was a weather pattern. Rill traced paths with the tip of a finger on their knee. “He said the pictures are already up,” Rill said. “I should see what’s being said.”

“We can,” Tansy said, reaching into her bag for a cracked phone whose data plan was not miraculous. “We can find out the degree of the mess.”

“No,” Rill said, not because they were noble but because they were afraid. They did not want to read their name in a mouth that did not know what it was saying. “Later. Another hour of work first. To make something true. So whatever I read isn’t all there is.”

“You always did love homework,” Granite murmured, but there was nothing cruel in it.

They moved. They worked the parts of the city that do not need your name to know you. At the nursery by the tracks they put straight a sign that had been crooked for seven days and whose crookedness was turning into a habit. At the dog park they picked up the squeakers of dead toys and put them on a bench where a child would find them and see the world as magical salvage. They sorted a bin behind the stadium by scent alone, which looks theatrical and is a practical economy of motion. Rill’s particular set of skills was not glamour; it was specificity. It felt very good to use it.

In a quieter back alley, a human woman sat on a step with a rolled-up poster stuck to her cheek. Half asleep, she was smiling. The magpies said her name was Nora and that she sometimes put out a bowl of water for the feral cats. They also told Rill that she cried when she found straws in the creek, which made her boring in a way that delights sprites. Boring is caring when you do it every day.

Rill checked the angles. They had an idea. It popped like a bubble: a silly thought, a kettle of nonsense. But sometimes you need to set a little trap for your opposite, one that requires grace, not the optics he loves. Rill pulled the leaf of paper from inside their sleeve and wrote on it in sprite marks until the paper looked like a fallen piece of a tree, which is to say, like a letter from the ancient alphabet of this place. They folded it in on itself. They peered at their own handwriting like it might bite. Then they slid it under the keg.

“What is it?” Tansy asked.

“When someone thinks they’re the only one making the rules,” Rill said, “and then the rules are not there when they go to step down on them. That is the smallest justice.”

“That is fortune cookie talk,” Granite said, but he was smiling now. “Lure him, then.”

“He won’t come here for beer,” Tansy said.

“No,” Rill said. “He’ll come for applause. He’ll come for the place where the rumor gets told best.”

They did not have long to wait. The photos spread. It is a talent of bad news to grow legs. The false narrative grew vines. In one corner of the internet, a woman in a floral dress said something precise, hopeful, unsexy, fact-based about how bailers actually work. In another corner someone with a baseball cap and a loud voice shouted about waste and fraud and the end of civilized society one plastic spoon at a time. In yet another corner, Grack, by his own screen, loped through comment fields under different names and made small noises that sounded like agreement and were actually the kind of grin that does its best work unseen.

Rill waited for him in the place where he liked to hover—between the arguments. They made the air quiet around the keg. They set their palms flat to the concrete and felt the rumble of the city like a sympathetic drum. When he came, it was as if a temperature else snuck in on someone else’s shoes. You would not see him. You would see a ripple of birds. You would see a friend change the subject and not remember. You would see someone toss a can into a trash barrel because both openings were round and isn’t that enough.

“You made a mess,” Rill said, not looking up.

“I made a point,” he said. “Sometimes the same.”

“You want to watch it grow,” Rill said, and kept their eyes on their thumbs. “But you are not patient enough to let it flourish without your watering.”

He laughed. “Is that what this is? A parable? Did you get a flower crown in a festival I missed?”

“You missed a lot,” Rill said.

He stepped. Exactly where Rill had written their leaf of a trap. He stepped and expected the concrete to be where he’d left it. Rill’s particular set of skills did not include moving cement, but words change small things in small ways. His foot found a bubble of mischief. He slipped. Not much. Just a fraction of his own control torn. He stumbled. His palm slammed the keg. The keg gave a thunk like a gavel.

His eyes flashed. The least graceful thing about Grack is his anger when surprised. He hates not being the one to end things.

“You,” he said.

“Me,” Rill agreed.

He recovered quickly. He is not a fool. He smiled. “What now, little river? You make me fall and the city stops praying?”

“No,” Rill said softly. “I make you fall and remember that you fall. You are not air. You are not the judge. You are balance and imbalance as it suits you. But you, too, have a body.”

He hated the reminder. Bodies come with needs—water, sleep, a place to be unobserved. People with bodies cannot stay pure in their ideas. They must eat. This truth is the opposite of Grack’s favorite pose: the one where he perches outside of law. For a blink, Rill saw something of his old shape. Before he had learned to be an enemy; when he was only a draft of himself. He had had a laugh once that was not cruel. He nodded once toward Rill’s courage then, as if to acknowledge the thing that had been a long time ago in another version of the city.

“You can’t keep up,” he said, not unkindly. “I multiply.”

“So do we,” Rill said.

He looked at them as if measuring. At that moment Mateo came around the corner with a soda taller than his face and a straw like a tiny lance. He saw Rill. He saw Grack, which surprised Rill slightly. Perhaps the magpies had taught the boy to stare where the shadow was not. He stopped so suddenly the soda swayed.

“Oh,” he said. “Your enemy.”

Grack arched an eyebrow. “You have fans,” he told Rill. And then, to Mateo, in a voice bright with the false kindness that adults use when they want to see what a child will do: “What are you drinking, young person?”

“Root beer,” Mateo said. He lifted his chin. He was a brave kid in the way that counts: he knew what was his and what wasn’t.

“And what do you do with the cup when you’re done?” Grack asked, all tenderness, all trap, because he wanted to demonstrate that the child was part of the mess, to use him to puncture Rill’s faith.

Mateo considered his soda as if it had to answer for itself. “I will put the lid in the trash,” he said, slowly, “because it is... not paper, right? I will put the cup in the blue thing because it is paper. I will think about the straw.” He frowned. “I will ask my mom if she has a metal straw in her bag.”

Rill wanted to hug him and also to let him stand on his own two feet in his cleverness.

Grack smiled. “What if there is no blue thing?” he pressed.

Mateo did not look at Rill. He looked at his own shoes. “I will carry it until there is,” he said. “My abuela says the long way home is the one that counts if you are carrying someone else’s heart.”

Rill said, “You see?” They said it in a tone they reserved for miracles.

Grack made a face like the smell of disinfectant. He did not like where this was going. He did not like being fixed in the frame with a child and a small, true sentence. He preferred scale. He preferred the theater of failure. “Cute,” he said. “All right, then. We are back to adorable.”

He left. He did it the way he always did: with a small insult to the gravity of the scene. He plucked Mateo’s straw, not by force but by suggestion, flicked it in the air as a magician might coin a quarter, and then put it behind Mateo’s ear, like a pen. Mateo glared. “That was mine,” he said.

“Ownership,” Grack said, and vanished into a slant of shade.

Rill put a hand on the boy’s shoulder. “Are you okay?”

“I am not a prop,” Mateo said vehemently. It made Rill want to give him a ribbon for his words. He stood very tall. He looked at Rill as if he was deciding something. “I will tell my grandma you have an enemy. She will not be scared,” he said. “She has ways.”

Rill believed him. They watched him go, his head tipped just slightly to not spill the soda that had become suddenly too meaningful to trivially drink. The magpies shadowed him like the world’s least stealthy bodyguards.

“His strides are long,” Tansy murmured from nowhere, or from right beside them; sprites have a way of being both.

“He’ll grow into them,” Granite said. “We’ll grow into what we have to fight.”

Rill leaned back against the keg again. The metal thrummed under their shoulder like a calm heart. Their own heart, not calm. It was not the day they had planned. It was not the day Grack had planned either. That had to be enough for the first turn in this dance.

They went home that night to the place that is not a home in the human way. A bolthole, a space carved between the bricks under the eaves of a building no one looks at because it sells nothing anyone needs but postcards of things they already live among. Rill slid through the mouse-slit and set down their string bag. They took out from it the little knife with the oak handle, the scent cards they use to test plastics, an acorn, a receipt for a plant they had promised to water when the woman who loved it went to Denver for the day. They arranged their things the way some people set a table before they eat: the ritual not because anyone tells you to but because it makes your mouth ready for what it wants.

Then they picked up the phone Tansy had insisted they accept months ago, after three separate incidents where knowledge was the difference between catastrophe and inconvenience. The phone was older than the trees. It had been found in a thrift store, given to the sprites by a volunteer at a shelter who thought maybe it still had a map of a dog’s favorite walk on it. Rill turned it on. They touched the button like a match. The screen lit with the unkind kind of light that tells you you’re going to feed yourself things you don’t want to swallow.

They saw the pictures. The door propped. The woven ribbon. The smoke that was not a smoke. The comments. There were names Rill knew and names they did not. There was a video where a young man with a baseball hat and an opinion tried to make a joke about how the only thing being recycled was government rhetoric and his own breath and then he stumbled because you can’t hold that much scorn and breathe at the same time. There were corrections nested under the video like mice. There were deletions that made no sound—comments that began with the kernel of a fact and then stopped existing because someone decided they were not part of the story they were trying to tell.

Rill read until their eyes blurred the way water blurs when it is tired. Then they put the phone under the acorn, as if the acorn were a paperweight. It did nothing. Acorns can’t do everything.

They said out loud, to their empty bolthole, to the spider in the corner, to the shade that was watching them: “He has the upper hand.”

The spider shifted in its web, which is what spiders do when they are listening. The shade did not deny it. Sprites are not given to lying to themselves when the sun is down. It is a city, a system, a game. People will talk. People will be tired. People will want to be entertained. Grack is a master of the exact portion of chaos that looks like weather and not like deliberate choice. Rill would have to plan. They would have to do what they are good at: all the small work, and then one brave, foolish thing, and then another, and somewhere in the knitting together of those things, the dirty trick would not be the only thing people remembered.

Under their room, the city thrummed. The river did the song it does when the moon is not yet up. In the night, a train cut the air and thought of mountains. Rill fell asleep. Not peacefully. Not yet. But they fell, and the net caught them, made of magpie chatter and boy-wisdom and Granite’s rough hand on a railing and the smell of aluminum cans making their way home.

In dreams, the mislabelled bales rose and found their names again. In dreams, Grack slipped and slipped until all that kept him upright was the fact that there are corners even shadows cannot own. In dreams, someone dropped a handful of seeds into the space between two lungs the size of the city, and someone—maybe Rill, maybe all the someones who carry cups three blocks to find the right bin, who set out water for the cats, who put out their blue, their green, their stubborn gray—someone watered them and waited for the next day to see what came up.Chapter 3

In the morning, the city placed a warm palm over Rill’s eyes and told them to wake gently. The sun had not yet chosen a direction; it poured itself into alleys and onto stoops as if it were testing recipes. Heat would come later with its brass band, but for now breath came in sleeves, and the Poudre counted in quiet, steady clicks, running its thumb down the bead-string of dawn. Rill lay still in their borrowed alcove and watched dust in a slant of light practice being galaxies. They had not slept well, exactly, but the body does its stubborn work when you let it, and the part of Rill that was animal had catalogued the night’s dangers and put them, for the moment, on a high shelf. The part that was sprite had not stopped at all. It had traced loops in the air, rehearsed a hundred small remedies, argued with itself about strategy in a whisper that had kept the spider in the corner from falling asleep. The spider forgave them out of professional respect. Web work was web work, whether you did it with silk or lists.

When they slid down to the street, morning moved like a new bicycle: a little cautious, pleased with itself. A magpie lighted on the lip of a gutter and regarded Rill with a solemnity that would have looked ridiculous on any other creature. It had a ring in its beak, dull gold with a scratch where a life had snagged it once and stayed. Rill held out a hand. The bird dropped the ring and then, as if embarrassed to have brought something so obvious, hopped backward and found a more respectable distance.

“You’re starting a jewelry store?” Rill asked.

“We’re starting a cache,” the magpie said, offended and pragmatic all at once. “For later.”

“For when?”

“For when you make a hole in the dark,” the bird said. “We like to line holes in the dark with good things.”

Rill slipped the ring into the pocket behind their heart. The gesture had no magic in it except the kind that every pocket has when it holds something for someone else. The magpie preened as if to say that in a world where humans kept statistics about romance and trash collection, there was no reason birds could not indulge an equivalent ritual. On the telephone wires, the rest of the flock were already rehearsing for the day’s bulletins, a radio station of intelligent rumor.

They went to the river first. They always did before anything that would require them to argue with themselves. The Poudre was a schoolteacher of a small town in that hour, patient without condescension. Rill sat on a boulder that remembered glaciers and listened to the numbers it offered without drama. Flow rate. Temperature. The number of crawdads under the lip two stones to the left. The number of forgotten coins sunk near the old rope swing. Thirty-two. Forty-nine. Nine. Thirteen. The river had not changed its litany as a favor. It had never made a habit of deciding who deserved calm. If you wanted a metronome, you had to come to it without demanding that it become your song.

They took the breath the river taught them and put it into their feet. They walked Old Town’s bones and let the square know they were there. It knew. The bricks had Rill’s stride by now. There was chalk still on the pavement from last night’s children who had drawn monsters with impeccable manners. There was a woman with a broom who knew where Rill was without seeing, because certain presences leave a tasteful indentation on the morning, the way an extra chair left in a kitchen feels like an invitation even when no one mentions parties.

Rill meant to keep moving, to pull the thread of their plan through as many eyes as possible before it snagged, but the smell of cinnamon and cloves curled around their ear like a hook. Cafe de olla, said the hook. A hand unlatched a screen door. A voice said, “Ven, criatura.” The invitation was the polite kind that is actually an instruction.

Abuela Lety sat on a concrete step, her apron already forgiving the day in advance. She did not look like she would belong in a book about sprites if we are being lazy about tropes. She looked like herself: a woman who had kept plants alive in apartments with one window and carried recipes in her hands because not everyone gets to write things down. Her hair was the gray of doves and storms; her sandals had known three summers more than their stitching could explain. She poured Rill a chipped cup of the cinnamon coffee and did not ask if they wanted sugar, because she had a theory that sugar was not a topping but an angle.

“I was going to find you,” Rill said. They took the cup. The clay held the heat like a secret you tell only to make your throat smoother.

“I know,” Abuela Lety said. “But I am old and your legs are young, and the old should sit when they can so the young do not have to pretend they are not tired.”

“You can see me,” Rill said, unnecessary as an observation and necessary as a comfort.

“I can see the part of the air that moves even when the air is pretending to sit still,” she said. “My sister could, too, before she married a man who liked towels too much. Sit. Tell me your trouble.”

Rill sat. They did not mean to repeat the story as if saying it would make it less sticky, but they could not help it. Words are containers that sometimes leak. They told her about the codes and the braid and the door and the almost-smoke. They told her about the photographs and the comments and the boy who did not want to be a prop. They told her about the flick of plastic against a bird’s beak. Abuela Lety did not interrupt except when interruption was the only loving thing to do. When she put her hand out to touch Rill’s sleeve, it was like placing a weight on a paper so it would not be blown off the table by your own breath.

“The man who is not a man,” she said at the end, “he wants the part of you that is righteous to get tired and sit down in the wrong chair.”

“He calls things adorable,” Rill said, as if that were his worst sin.

“That is a word people use when something makes them feel small and they don’t want to look at why,” Abuela Lety said. “My mother used to say that the devil is lazy most of the time. It is only when the good are awake that he has to stretch.”

“I have to get ahead of his pattern,” Rill said. “He makes loops. He multiplies small harms until they look like weather. He wants me to fight every particular until I become the argument he is making.”

“You have to become the day instead,” she said. She reached behind her, into the dark square of the kitchen, and pulled out a braid of marigold stems and copper wire that had once been an extension cord. It had been made by hands that knew how to twist two kinds of usefulness into a third. The flowers had dried to a color that did not apologize. The wire had learned a softer language by being forced to listen. “Take,” she said. “Put where your work needs eyes.”

“What does it do?” Rill asked. They held it as if it might burn.

“It does not do anything,” Abuela Lety said. “It makes you remember to do. And sometimes the remembering is contagious. Also the color is good for scaring away foolishness. Not evil, you understand. Evil is big. This is for foolishness, which is bigger.”

Rill nodded. They liked her distinctions. They liked the way she did not present tools as charms and charms as tools and then scold you for not knowing which was which. “I also need a spectacle,” they said, unwilling and resigned. “He likes pictures. He will not be undone by facts alone. He expects me to try to out-argue him. I need to make something he can’t enter without showing his own shadow.”

“Ah,” she said, pleased as if a cake had risen. “So you will make a party.”

Rill grimaced. They were the exact opposite of party people while at the same time never missing a party if the purpose was noble. “A gathering,” they amended dryly, which only made her laugh.

“Call it what it is,” Abuela Lety said. “People are already having parties. You only have to move one by one their feet from the place where they are to the place where you need them. Make them carry something. The hands teach the mind and the tongue follows.”

“Carry what?”

“The long way home,” she said, and grinned at her own theft. “You bring me word,” she added, as if this were not a city dotted with phones, and Rill promised in the only way a sprite can promise: with a little bow that is also a binding.

They left her stoop with the marigold braid and the taste of cinnamon on their mouth. The braid buzzed under their sleeve like a beehive that had decided to be decorative for a day. Rill threaded it into the strap of their bag and let themselves be tugged in the direction it wanted. It wanted, as it turned out, to go toward the place where posters are born, where glue learns to be loyal, where the smell of ink is so confident it could walk into a room without introducing itself.

Nora looked up when Rill came in, the way a person looks when their name is said from behind them without sound. She had a cat magazine open on the counter but was not reading. Her hands were a printer’s hands, the fingernails a little ruined in the pleasing way that says ink has a habit of reminding you where it has been. “Hey, ghost,” she said cheerfully, which is how people who half-see keep themselves safe: by submitting their fear to humor before it grows teeth.

“Hey, maker,” Rill said. “Do you do rush jobs?”

“On Tuesdays I do,” she said. “On days that smell like police radios I definitely do. What do you need?”

“A map that is not a map,” Rill said. “A poster that is not a poster. Something that tells the truth very plainly without looking like it wants to tell the truth very plainly.”

Nora’s eyes crinkled. “You need a recipe card.”

“Yes,” Rill said, surprised into pleasure. “That.”

“Recipe for what?”

“For getting your hands back,” Rill said. “For walking the long way with your trash because you feel like the short way is a dare you don’t have to take. For showing up at a place because you were asked by a piece of paper that looked like a favor.”

Nora flipped through a drawer of blanks until she found a stack of card stock that had once been a calendar in another life. She laid out a grid that would look like cooking until it didn’t. She drew, with the quick strokes of a person who trusts her lines: Step one, put your lid in the trash because it is not paper, stop arguing on the internet and listen to the sound a can makes when it decides to be a bell. Step two, carry. Step three, show up at the square at dusk with something that can be made new and the story of where you found it. Step four, look at a machine the way it wants to be looked at: as a mirror you can fix.

“That’s a lot of words,” she said, even as she fit them into the recipe box like you fit cinnamon into a cookie until you taste it but do not see it. “People don’t read.”

“They read if it feels like they might get to be clever instead of corrected,” Rill said. “They read if the font looks like their grandmother. They read if there’s a drawing of a crow.”

“Magpie,” Nora corrected promptly, drawing a bird with the comic severity of a courtroom illustration. “You’ll have them carry to the MRF?”

“Not there. Yet,” Rill said. “The square first. The showing, later. I cannot keep people safe around belt lines and bailers with only hope. We need volunteers with shirts and clipboards who know which lever doesn’t stick. We need a human to stand on a pallet and admit her mistake from last year when she put her cast-iron pan in the blue bin because she was tired. We need a teenager who can talk about polymer chains without yawning.”

“I know a teenager,” Nora said. “He’s bored of everything except being right. This will be perfect.”

“Also,” Rill said, and let the marigold braid out of their sleeve to lie on the counter the way a warning lies down to make itself pettable, “I need your help keeping an eye on this.”

Nora did not ask what it was. She put her hand on it and nodded, as if she were a conductor being offered a tuning fork. “I’ll hang one in the window,” she said. “I’ll hang one behind the coffee shop that says it’s too busy to go outside. I’ll send a stack to Mrs. Valdez at the elementary. She’ll make her students feel like secret agents for sainthood.”

Rill took a stack, and a roll of tape that would obey their fingers the way tape sometimes does for the deserving, and left into the bright. The day had grown louder since the coffee. The sound of opinion was in the air the way pollen is, and just as itchy. At the corner of Laurel and College a man with a mustache was telling his friend that he had seen with his own eyes a raccoon dragging an entire recycling bin into a culvert. At the bench near the bus stop two teenagers were arguing softly about whether climate grief was a luxury, one careful not to use the word luxury aloud because it felt cruel when the other’s shoes were frayed. The soda machine at the student union hiccuped, and Rill touched its metal side as if to steady a drunk uncle. The machine burped up an extra can. They did not take it. They let it roll to someone who needed a small, undeserved joy.

They threaded the string of their plan through as many hands as they could without looking like a puppeteer who had gotten ideas above their station. Rill liked it best when ideas arrived home in a voice that did not resemble their own. By noon, there were recipe cards in backpacks and clipboards in text messages, squares of marigold color stuck to boards next to band posters and missing-cat notices. The magpies, delighted with their role as messengers, dropped pull tabs onto the cards like seals of approval. One bird had taken to wearing a paperclip as jewelry and was consequently insufferable.

Grack did not keep still for other people’s plans. He rarely does. He inserted himself into noon. Rill felt him before they saw him, the air around the intersection going slack for a half-breath, like someone loosening a belt under a table. The coffee cart on Laurel was busy; the woman making lattes could make a leaf in foam without looking because there are machines some humans are born to. Grack stood exactly where a shadow from an awning decided to be temporary and pretended to admire a poster for a band whose guitars had too many pedals. He did not look at Rill. He did not need to. The trickster’s favorite audience is the corner of your eye, the part of you that considers turning away to read anything with fewer consequences.

He had already done it, Rill realized, by the smell. The compost bin behind the cart—green lid, cheerful sticker, dent—was rehearsing a tragedy. Grack had seeded it with a dozen knives and forks made of plastic that had been taught to claim they were under a prophecy. Compostable, the packages had said in a font with leaves. In the wrong place, with the wrong time, with the wrong heat, they would be exactly what they looked like. The sticker on the lid would do the rhetorical work of pretending that this was fine, and then someone would come along with worry and a camera. It would take the right temperature and the right turnings and the right patience to make them disappear, patience not easily found in the alley behind people’s caffeine.

“New loop,” Rill said out loud for their own benefit.

“Old loop,” Grack said, reading their lips, pleased when he didn’t have to invent new lines. “People love a promise with a barcode. They love to believe that as long as something looks like a banana leaf it is absolved.”

“You like to make absolution rotten,” Rill said.

He accepted the compliment. He accepted every slight as if it were a coin he could spend twice. “You make your little party,” he said. “I brought forks.”

Rill did not bother to answer him. They opened their throat and tuned to the voices of polymers. The ones in the forks were already whining. Plausibility squealed. It was a sound like shoes on a gym floor when everyone is being careless because the bell has rung. Rill put their palms over the bin and made a small circle. They did not exorcize. They did not try to unmake what had been made. They introduced the forks to their consequences. They whispered the recipe for heat into the lid. They told the microbes a joke. They called a woman who had time and gloves and a perverse love of sorting. She arrived exactly as if she had been walking past, exactly as if she were going to do this anyway. She took a fork in each hand and held them up like a scale.

“Not today,” she said to the forks. “You are for industrial, you little liars. Go wait your turn.” She put them into a bag that had seen worse and had not become worse because of it. Rill loved her. Rill loved her because she had taken the performance out of a trap. She had made it boring again, and boredom is where stewardship goes to do its real lifting.

Grack’s mouth did not twitch, which was as close as he came to scowling. He turned the charm up, and the charm slid off Old Town’s shoulders like oil off a duck, because the day had been primed quietly with three hundred small agreements. That is the infuriating part for people who live for spectacle: the way a city can, if you tend it, raise antibodies you did not proselytize for.

By four o’clock, the recipe had become a rumor that had become a plan. Kids rode with crates on their handlebars. Office workers who had not been to the square since the summer they interned at the shoe store took a long way back from lunch with a paper bag of their own confessions. A brewer who had opinions about everything carried a garbage bag full of aluminum like Santa after a personal revelation. Now and then, a person would stand at a corner and look confused and smile as if someone were standing next to them explaining something without making them feel stupid. Rill had put sprite marks on the sidewalk where they could—an extra dot under an arrow, a leaf above an instruction—and the people who were not supposed to see them did not. The people who were trying saw enough to feel accompanied.

Tansy fell in with Rill at Mountain Avenue, her cheeks flushed with having run and argued simultaneously for three hours. She had a bandage on one knuckle and a grin that made the day feel like it had a spine again. “Emergency council meeting Wednesday,” she said, rolling her eyes. “There will be ties. Is it worse to watch a man who has never rinsed a yogurt container pretend to care about landfill methane or better?”

“Depends on whether he has a dog,” Rill said. “People who pick up after dogs are less likely to be performative about rinsing.”

Granite joined them at the square, heavy and steady as ever. He had grease on his sleeve and foil confetti in his hair that he had chosen not to notice. The square itself had put on its old face—the one with live music and kids trying to climb the stage and someone dancing even though technique had never been invited. A woman from the city stood near a microphone and visibly tried to decide if she should stand in front of people and say what she had to say or if she should find a person who liked microphones more. Rill felt tenderly toward her and decided not to nudge her one way or the other. It is also a gift to let someone find their footing without turning gravity.

The plan, such as it was, was not a plan. It was a place to put things down. Someone had dragged out a scale that had weighed zucchini at the farmers market until it learned about pop songs. Nora had a stack of stickers that said Chosen Long Way. A teenager did indeed explain polymers into a microphone in a way that made three other teenagers immediately reexamine their contempt for the world. The brewer who had never apologized in his life apologized without saying sorry by handing his bag to a volunteer and then staying to hand other bags to other people. The magpies lined the gazebo roof like punctuation. When someone tossed a can absent-mindedly toward the wrong receptacle, a bird dropped a pull tab directly in front of their toes and said, in a voice only Rill and the very young heard, “Try that sentence again.”

Rill moved among the bodies like an unremarkable wind and let their work be done by the moving. They touched a bale of paper as if it were a friend at a funeral. They adjusted a sign. They listened to the river relocate itself in the minds of people who had not visited it for a while. They made sure the man with the mustache was asked to help with the bags because participation is anesthesia for opinions. They watched Mateo arrive holding his cup like a small chalice, his grandmother beside him, both of them looking like they were humorously prepared to run a revolution if the opportunity presented itself.

“I brought the straw,” Mateo said gravely to Rill as if returning a crown. He had washed it, which told Rill the important thing: he had gone home first for water.

“You brought a story,” Rill corrected, and put a marigold sticker on the boy’s shoulder. “Do not give it away for free,” they added, and he nodded, which is the nod of a child who understands commerce in attention better than adults like to admit.

Dusk did what dusk is always trying to do: make everyone more beautiful and more fragile at the same time. The fairy lights strung between buildings were old, not in the way of being threadbare, but in the way of having become habits. Grack hovered at the edge of the habit and tried to pull one bulb. He liked it when a single failure turned into a string of failures; it matched his theology. He pinched the idea between two fingers like a fly and snapped. The lights flickered and then went out, a thousand tiny decisions choosing, for once, not to shine.

For half a second the square exhaled: the quiet intake of people about to be told what mood they were going to have. Rill did not let the mood be dictated. They did a thing they had not wanted to do until they had to: they took the breath from the river and blew it into the center of the square. It was not sorcery. It was the kind of thing that looks like luck if you are not paying attention. Phones went up, yes—humans love to make their own little stars—but before the rectangles of light could declare themselves sovereign, someone began to tap on a can, and then someone else. Then the brewer, who had both rhythm and poor impulse control, took a keg mallet to the side of a barrel with a sound that wandered toward joy. The square took the beat like a heart offered its own replacement. Children slapped their thighs, delighted to be permitted to be loud as a virtue. The marigold braids on the volunteer badges reflected nothing and everything.

Grack’s hand froze in the air in a posture he rarely adopted: uncertainty. He had planned to feed the dark with speculation and to let the speculation feed on the heap of worry under the table. But the dark wasn’t empty. It was full of rhythm and people outside of their screens looking at each others’ faces with their faces. It is hard to start a rumor in a room where everyone is in on the joke of their own goodness. He could have insisted. He could have conjured. He withdrew his hand instead. He is not foolish. He does not throw energy at an engine that is operating on a kind of fuel he cannot metabolize.

The lights came back on one by one in the way that makes a person suddenly aware of the ways that each bulb has a personality. The official with the microphone cleared her throat and made a decision. She stood on the stage and admitted her mistake from last year when she had told people rinsing was optional. She said she had changed her mind. She talked about bailers in a voice that shook only twice. She told people to come tour the facility on Saturday. She promised clipboards. She promised to let someone else speak first at the council meeting. She did not puff herself up with the words transparency or accountability. She used the word visit like a blanket. People clapped like they were clapping for their own future. Perhaps they were.

It was not perfectly clean. Nothing good is. A man near the fountain muttered that this was all a performance and wasn’t it cute how the city made us do its work for it. A woman in a beanie said loudly that she’d heard the whole thing was a scam and what about the giant pile of crushed glass out on the edge of town, huh, what did that mean. A teenager rolled his eyes so hard he almost became a headline. Rill did not argue. The river does not argue with the rock. It moves around it, and slowly the rock changes its mind. Rill nudged a dog to tug the beanie-woman’s sleeve toward the teenager explaining polymers. They let the muttering man carry one of the heavier bags. People are sometimes their best selves when they are not being watched applaud.

When the square had quieted to that hum cities make when they have remembered they are not doomed for a few hours, Rill and Granite and Tansy leaned against the side of the stage and let the exertion come off their bones. It was stupid to be proud. It was also necessary. You cannot continue to put your shoulder to a machine without sometimes stepping back and admiring the small groove your shoulder has made. We are animals; we need to see our own marks.

“He’ll go for organics next,” Granite said, reading the day the way old men read clouds and tell you whether you can hang laundry or not. “If he can make people doubt the compost, he’ll say the whole thing smells. He’ll go to the restaurants and the stadium and the apartments with the three bins and tiny kitchens. He’ll pick the place where coffee filters look like paper and eggshells look like rocks and everyone is tired.”

“He already started,” Rill said. They told them about the forks and the industrial facilities and the woman with two hands and the gift of turning traps into chores. “We need to train the microbes,” they said. “We need to make the right heat. We need to write a love letter to rot that people will actually read.”

“Recipe cards for dirt,” Tansy said, delighted. “I like a city that cooks its way out of trouble.”

The magpies swooped low, one of them dropping a ring that clinked at Rill’s feet—the ring from the morning, carried out of the pocket behind the heart with a flourish because birds like to pretend they are the ones making you remember. Rill picked it up. It had warmed in the day’s pocket and now felt like a yes. They slipped it over the marigold braid, and the two metals regarded each other like cousins at a reunion who do not recognize each other’s words but understand the laugh.

In the lull after the applause, Grack came close enough for civility and not close enough for courtesy. He had no use for the stickers on the volunteers’ chests. He had fewer uses for the look on Rill’s face. He looked at the stage, at the people disassembling their temporary project with the carefulness that does not make a mess, at the keg reflecting sunset in a way that made it look heroic. He did not smile. He did not sneer. He did what he always did when he was thinking harder than he liked: he addressed the air so he wouldn’t have to address Rill’s eyes.

“Enjoy your little bake sale,” he said. “Maybe you get your tour. Maybe you get your clipboards. Maybe you get your teenager to make a TikTok that makes other teenagers less tired for thirty seconds. Systems trip. I’ll be there to notice.”

“You’re very good at noticing,” Rill said. “You should write it down somewhere. Perhaps a little book of observations with a ribbon.”

“Adorable,” he said on reflex, but there was no heat in it. He was doing inventory. He was revising his loops. His gaze snagged on Abuela Lety, standing with her grandson, eating a paleta with such obvious delight that the world could not pretend to be dire in that radius. The old woman looked at him the way old women look at a mouse in the kitchen: not fearful, just efficient. He looked away first. It was small. It was not nothing.

When he had taken himself away, as he always did—gray between the gray, absence dressed as an option—Rill found themselves empty in the dizzying way that follows effort. They let it be. They let their ribs cool. They let the square seat itself in their lap like a cat that knows you will sit until it decides you may stand.

That night, when they slid back into their alcove with the small triumphs tucked under their tongue, they did not turn the phone on. They did not check the comments. They did not count the pictures. They laid the marigold braid on the floor and put the ring where its light had been, and in the corner, the spider repositioned a strand because atmosphere required it. The city did its not-quite-sleep. The river put its mouth to the bank and made soft words that do not work in any human mouth.

They slept, and in the dreams that come when you have tried something and not failed, the compost bin at the coffee cart grew warm in the right way, a slow celebration. People stood around it the way they stand around a fire when they have earned warmth. Someone wrote a recipe on a chalkboard and a child erased the word dirt and replaced it with earth as if she had stumbled upon the password. In the morning, that child would wake and not remember the dream and take a banana peel to a green-lidded bin and tell her teacher it felt like feeding.

Dawn would come. The council would meet. Grack would set his next loop. And Rill would go to the MRF with a stack of clipboards and a string bag full of patience and a plan for teaching microbes, because there were a lot of small, unruly beings in the city and some days they were all very tired and some days they were capable of singing themselves into a better mood, and the trick was to remember which kind of day you were making.Chapter 5

By the time the day with the ties arrived, the city had been up longer than the sun. Trucks wrote their cursive down College before dawn; bakery air slid under doors; the Poudre rolled its knuckles over gravel to clear its throat. Rill did not pretend ease. They asked the morning for the blunt grace of sequence: first this, then that, then the next thing without dramatics. The morning obliged by giving them a list disguised as errands. They put the marigold braid over their shoulder where a sash would go if they were the kind of person who wore sashes, and the copper wire hummed quietly as if it could hear electricity dreaming in distant walls.

They started at the roaster because heat is a law and habits like to borrow its rules. The sack of chaff looked like the hair of an old dog and smelled like a book trying to be coffee. The roaster smiled with hands and reached for the scoop before Rill had to pretend they were buying anything. “You’re the reason our alley doesn’t smell like burned apologies,” he said, and Rill dipped their head in the direction of humility. They said thank you to the chaff itself, because it would be asked to give up the last of its small sugars to strangers.

From there, the brewery with the animal in the name that the story never says aloud because the animal would blush if it heard. Spent grain steamed in a bin the size of a kiddie pool that had decided to go to graduate school. Brewers are the kind of people who love waste like a child loves secrets; they understand that nothing ever ends, it just transforms until it finds a party where it fits. A brewer with a tattoo of a hop cone placed exactly where remorse would be in an anatomy drawing hefted one end of the bin. Rill took the other because pride is foolish and physics is a friend who needs both your hands. The magpies approved by dropping pull tabs in a line as if to annotate the path. Someone behind them whistled the wrong song to the right beat and the day marched.

They visited the stable that was technically outside city limits but lived in the city’s throat nonetheless. Straw crackled in bales bound in twine that had remembered being grass badly but was trying. The woman who mucked with a rhythm you could set to a metronome did not bother to ask why, because some purposes unravel when you interrogate them. She lifted her pitchfork like a scepter and pointed at the neat stack. “Take as much as your creature back there can carry,” she said, and when Rill turned, puzzled, she was looking not at a mule but at the cart Rill had built out of a stroller, a skateboard, and a polite lie about weight limits. It creaked as if to be dramatic and then consented to do its job.

They borrowed bags from the city crew who were trimming branches on Mountain, the bags that say temporary in their fiber and permanent in their utility. The crew’s boss had forearms the color of walnuts and a way of looking at Rill that suggested he had seen more kinds of helpers than he was willing to name. He nodded once and handed them a pair of gloves without making a joke. That is the highest respect a certain kind of man can pay a certain kind of magic.

The municipal yard wore its smells like medals. In one corner, the trucks that had found their retirement carved open like seed pods. In another, the windrows of compost lay like long sleeping animals breathing the kind of breath that makes winter plants think about April. Marta ran the yard with the benign ruthlessness of a woman who does not have time for second chances and who forgives constantly anyway. Her hair was tied back with a rag that had once been a softball team’s shirt, and her clipboard carried pen marks that looked like constellations with practical desires.

“You’re making school in my yard,” she said, pleasant as a brick laid true.

“I am,” Rill said, because deflecting a compliment is ruder than taking it. “I brought a chorus and a stage.”

Marta tapped the marigold braid with the end of her pencil and did not ask what it did. “Make a corner,” she said, gesturing with her whole arm toward a patch near the gate where eyes would be interruptible. “I’ve got a probe you can use. Don’t break it. It knows more than I do and doesn’t hold grudges.”

“Heat first, then volume,” Rill murmured, half to themselves, half to the microbes already sniffing the air with organs too small to be drawn. The ratio sang to them the way chords do when you stand very close to a piano with your cheek against the wood. Two measures of carbon grumble inside the one measure of nitrogen, wood fiber lowering itself to meet green waste and coffee fluffs cleaving to eggshells as if any of them remembered being farm in more than poetry. They layered browns like blankets and slipped in the brewery warmth the way you coax bread dough into belief. Stray light found its way into the twine; the marigolds on the braid stared at the pile ferociously until foolishness looked away. Rill stuck the probe as gently as if they were introducing a shy person at a party. Numbers rose into Marta’s palm and made themselves comfortable.

“Give it a day and a half,” Marta said. “Two if the weather gets old and doesn’t want to run. Don’t let them drown it trying to be helpful. People love to water things to death.” She said it without malice because humans deserve their habits and the humor that keeps them from turning inside out about the world. She glanced at Rill with a look that passed for vulnerability in her face. “You make sure the committee sees this with their noses and not their paperwork. One good steam at the right moment will save me three months of answering emails.”

“I have a steam in my pocket,” Rill said lightly, and she grunted the kind of laugh that covers hope in burlap to keep it from catching a chill.

Rumor likes to dress up. It put on a tie and walked to City Hall smelling like aftershave and unslept coffee. The council chambers had seen the city at every angle: birthdays for ordinances, funerals for plans, a wedding once when two residents decided the room with the flags was the only place their mothers could both stomach. Rows of chairs tried prematurely to become opinions. Granite made himself part of the wall near the back with a patience that looked like furniture and felt like a dam. Tansy fluttered at the edge of laughter because if she did not smile she had a feeling she would bite someone politely.

The people came in with a weather of their own. There were the ones with binders and those without but with the expression that suggests their opinions had been ironed while still damp. There were high schoolers who had skipped something and wore their mischief like sunscreen. There was a man with a tie that had a moose wearing sunglasses, and a woman with a notebook labeled questions and a second notebook labeled questions I will not ask out loud. There was the brewer, newly contrite in a way that read as a civic mood rather than personal evolution. Nora took a seat near the aisle so she could leave if sitting still threatened to undo the stitches she’d put in the day. Abuela Lety swept in with her grandson like a weather pattern dressed as two people. The boy’s shirt had stars on it, and he had put the marigold sticker on his forehead because children know where symbols look best.

Grack had a chair. He did not need one, but he approved of appearances that looked like deference to process when they were really the opposite. He sat, legs crossed, hands folded, face politely empty. If you asked the room later whether they had seen him, they would say no, all the while recalling a draft that had made the hair on their arms prick for a second and then smooth as if someone had whispered a half-rhyme.

The city staffer in charge of speaking first wore a jacket purchased for success and a shirt purchased for future regret. She took the microphone with the suppressed wheeze of somebody holding up two ends of an argument and trying not to have the middle drop out. “Thank you for coming,” she said, and when the murmur died, she did an admirable thing: she talked about the part where they had been wrong. She did not say transparency. She said we messed up. She did not say accountability. She said we are still here and it is our job to stay even when people are mad at us. Her hair apologized for humidity without asking permission. She introduced the topic of organics like a neighbor introducing a dog that had jumped a fence and was trying very hard to behave.

The first speaker called on himself. He had the moose tie and the confidence of a man whose father had bought him a tool set and a set of talking points and, in a moment of unintentional tenderness, taught him to use both. “I read that compost is full of plastic,” he said, and there were nods because the line is an easy one to say and feels like a finished thought. He waved a printed article with a headline that you could hear even before you read it. “We’re putting micro-particles into our soil,” he continued, flushing like someone who has touched something that was supposed to be rusty and found it shining.

Rill felt the room turn the way schools of fish turn, not suddenly, but with one agreed-upon decision that manifests as movement a second later. They did not rush the microphone. They are not the kind of creature whose best work is done at the center of a circle. They turned instead to the open doors where air stitched itself up into honesty without being asked. “Marta,” they said, and a minute later Marta was a rectangle in the archway, sunglasses on her head like a crown of indifference. She had dirt under three fingernails and a temperature probe like a scepter.

“This is the pile you will smell right now if you were to be invited outside,” Marta said before anyone could explain her into a narrower role. She held up the probe with a reading that even people who do not trust numbers recognize as a fever that is good. “We screened the batch from last month for plastics with a drum that could eat your car and would, if I were allowed to drive it where it belonged,” she added without smiling because it is unseemly to talk about joy in a room with carpet. “If you want to talk about what doesn’t belong, I will talk. But I don’t want to talk in here.”

Tansy, who had a list of speakers and had planned it as if planning could ever manage a citizenry, made a noise that in a lesser person would be called a flail and in her looked like applause in a minor key. “Fifteen minutes,” she said into her clipboard, at the same time as the council chair, who had perfected the art of restraint in a blazer, said, “Let’s adjourn briefly and relocate to the north plaza,” with a voice that had decided to be reasonable as a tactic.

Outside, April pretended she did not know she was April and wore the sky like a shirt people would argue about at dinner. The square by the steps was gagged by caution tape often enough for maintenance that it felt honored to host something else. Marta led the line the way someone leads a dance they have not advertised and made the first bow to the pile like a host. Steam rose. There are many kinds of steam. There is the steam of impatience and the steam of accident and the steam of bragging. This was the steam of bodies doing exactly what they were designed to do, together. It came up like a story invented by a grandmother that turns out to be science if you sit in it long enough.

Marta put a fist of the material into a sifting frame because she knows spectacle needs a handmaiden named demonstration. She shook. Small bones of material fell through into a pan. The smell came up and people leaned in because conviction is easier with your nose than with your ideals. It smelled like the top layer of a field in May when the tractors have decided to be gentle. It smelled like the back corner of a good cellar. It did not smell like a promise broken. Grack wrinkled the part of his face that is never seen by cameras and starts fights in elevators.

The moose-tie man wrinkled his nose because faces are herd animals and followed suit. “What about the micro-,” he began, but Marta was already there with the frame turned up to catch light. A shard glinted, pale and obscene. She plucked it with the accuracy of a person who eats fish on the bone and never swallows a pin. “This,” she said, “is a fork that says compostable at the wrong temperature. This,” and she held it up so the sun could scold it, “is why we don’t put dreams in my pile. We put food. We put napkins. We put the flowers when they are tired. We do not put the package someone designed in a rush to satisfy a demand made by a person who likes to feel virtuous while buying shiny things.”

Nora raised a hand like a student whose pride has learned humility just enough to be strategic. “Then what do we do with the forks?” she asked, loud enough to be shame-proof, because it is a gift to give other people their questions in a body that looks like yours.

“Industrial facility,” said the teenager Nora had promised, up on the steps with a diagram that would have won a fair a decade ago. He was nervous but his nervousness had gone to work instead of to complaint. “Different heat, different bugs,” he said, and everybody smiled because bugs is a word with charm even in a city that calls inspectors when more than three gather under a light. “PLA does not melt like chocolate. It hates your backyard. Put it in the trash unless your package has very precise words on it and your city says so,” he added, throwing a glance at the staffer who, to her credit, shouted, “It does not,” while making a note to make the website say it even louder.

Abuela Lety stepped forward not because she had been asked but because the day had called for a grandmother and she had answered and that is how it goes. She took the ring from Rill’s braid without being told where it was, as if she were retrieving a spoon from a drawer in a kitchen she had never cooked in. She set it on the pile like a yes. “We make tamales for Christmas,” she said to no one and all of them. “We soak the husks, we mix the masa, we put the filling in the middle. We fold the right way so they don’t open in the pot. We steam. We wait. If you open early, you have a mess that will still be food but is not the thing you promised with your hands. If you don’t put water in the bottom, you burn the pot. If someone comes and says, ‘I have a new paper, you can eat the paper and it tastes like corn,’ you look at them like you look at a child who is very dear to you and very foolish. You say, ‘Later, when you show me you have done the whole work.’ Until then,” and she patted the pile as if it were a toddler learning stairs, “we do it the way our noses know.”

Grack dug his heel into a crack in the concrete. He is at his most dangerous when he is bored. He flicked his fingers in a direction that was not theatrical. Behind the coffee cart on Laurel, the same trick was already in motion, this loop seeded before Rill had even asked Nora for cards. He had found a line on the schematic and pinched it: the blower that fed the MRF’s sorting room with steady air would cough at precisely the hour when curiosity would be fed there by school buses and clipboards. The cough would make paper float out of its intended streams, and the photographs would show flutter where order was supposed to be. At the same time, he had left something uglier in an alley off Olive: boxes of shrimp heads in July costume, a stink wrapped with a bow that would make neighbors call the hotline and the hotline say words like odor mitigation and the newspaper hired to cover a small city’s issues would write about the human nose instead of a policy. Grack earns his sleep with combinations.

The magpies saw fingers move like wind lifts leaves. They put the story into Rill’s shoulder by landing on it. Their feet ticked like an old clock. “He set two strings,” one said. “The one at the box and the one at the blow,” said another, unwilling to surrender their proximity to information just because rhyme makes it easier to hold.

Rill did the worst best thing: they ignored one loop. It tasted like eating an orange with the peel. They marked the alley with the shrimp heads for later, wrote it in their palm with Abuela’s discarded marigold petal, and turned toward the MRF with a resolve that did not stop to argue for elegance. Granite had already started walking because old men who have been heavy all their lives can achieve a speed that surprises when they are fed a good reason. Tansy thrust the diagram at the teenager without apology and hissed, “Command this,” and the teenager looked at the paper like it had betrayed him and then at twenty faces like they were a quiz and chose, as he would more and more, charisma.

They ran the way citizens run when it is about their specific machinery and not their general sense of being right. The white building was a rectangle of humming worry. Outside, the tour group gathered under a sun that was learning swagger after a morning spent being polite. Inside, the air sighed once and coughed and then tried to return to its sentence even though its punctuation had been stolen. Paper leapt like fish flinging themselves at a net. The belt rolled as if a joke had been told at its expense. The staffer guiding the tour had the good sense not to pretend. She said, “This happens,” and it did. It happened because entropy attends all parties. It happened because some parts are old and some parts were made on a Friday and some parts need love as payment for the way we make our days.

Rill put their hands on the wall and asked the building for its patience. The building grumbled back, not offended. It had never claimed to be anything but stubborn. They could coax the air, but the air belonged to a fan, and the fan belonged to a budget, and the budget belonged to a collection of people who loved their city exactly as much as they loved their bickering. Luckily, the building also belonged to Marta’s brother who worked three jobs and liked the MRF best because the pallet jack there had a moral code. He was on the mezzanine swearing in a register that made the magpies blush. He hit the reset with a palm that had fixed worse with less permission. The blower stuttered, wheezed, caught. Paper remembered which way was down by recalling gravity’s kiss. Someone clapped, a little, and then stopped, because it is weird to clap for physics even though it deserves it daily.

Grack watched from a window that no one remembered existed because a person had decided in 1997 that glass was a luxury. He did not bother to look annoyed when his loop did not spool the way he had prewritten it. Adjustment is a trick as old as the rest. He left a new breadcrumb in the shape of a comment on a fact sheet that would live on the city site by evening. He wrote under a name that tasted like leftover tortillas, sweet and reheatable, and said something that would sound reasonable to a cousin at Thanksgiving: how do we know this good stuff isn’t going to go to the landfill anyway. He knew it would land because cynicism is a warm bath and facts are a shower at a friend’s house where the knobs are confusing.

Rill could not be everywhere. This was not a lack; it was a law. They took their lack and used it as strategy, the way a carpenter uses the part of the wood that will never be straight to build a shelf that will hold books anyway. They left Grack’s comment to the web of humans who had used their hands in the square an hour ago and were now itching to use their mouths for something other than complaint. Nora took the bait and did not swallow the hook. She wrote a paragraph about specific trucks and specific men named Ray and Noe. She reminded a person that the people working in the white building were not faceless and that systems are made of faces. She told a story about a bale bound correctly so beautifully that three other people decided they liked that version of reality best, and sometimes that is literally all a city needs to get through a week.

The shrimp in the alley behind Olive would be a story tomorrow. Rill knew the window. If they went now, the pile would be a performance and the old woman who minded the cats would be shamed by association and Grack would get to write the line about filth. If they went at four in the morning with the crew that cleaned for pay and for pride, they could turn rot into the right flavor with a hose and salt and something else Abuela would tell them to add. It would smell, yes, but it would smell like work done and not like work abandoned in disgust. They wrote this plan on their thigh with a fingernail because sometimes you need to feel the indent later to remember you were serious.

When the tour concluded without being derailed by a gust of scandal, Marta appeared in the doorway with dirt still on her calves like a ranked insignia. She put the probe in Rill’s hand as if she were knighting them with a thermometer. “Bring them to the pile now,” she ordered sweetly, so they did. The council in their ties stood near steam and pretended not to love it and failed convincingly. The staffer exhaled in a way that made her insides a little larger permanently. The teenager explained enzymes to a retired teacher and the retired teacher felt that particular pleasure of being the student for once. Mateo sidled up to the pile and placed his hand carefully on a hot corner because he had a sense for what was dangerous in the good way and knew better than to put his cheek there.

“I have something to say,” he murmured toward Rill without pomp.

“You always do,” Rill murmured back, and he brightened like a streetlight waking. He walked to the step nearest the microphone as if he had always meant to and raised his small unmicrophoned voice the way children do who know exactly how many walls live in a building. He said, “This isn’t trash. It’s tomorrow.” He looked at the people with their binders and their pens and their anxieties draped like graduation honors. He looked at Grack without knowing and made the smallest polite face. “We can carry things. We do it all day. My abuela carries the laundry and the rice and the stories. We can carry this too.”

No one applauded because applause would have turned the sentence into something to be consumed. They hummed instead, a way of agreement. The magpies preened as if they had taught it to him, and perhaps they had; perhaps everything is a cache and the best things are found days after you hid them.

When the meeting reconvened under the stained wood and the invisible shiver of air-conditioning that had been budgeted for last century, the moose tie asked fewer questions. The beanie woman asked better ones. The staffer did not make promises she could not write on the wall with her actual job. They voted for tours and money for signs that told the truth with pictures and a pause in the city’s procurement of anything that called itself food service compostable without a last name. They voted to try a pilot for a drop-off at the library because the woman who wrangled story time had written an email that made them remember their own children in the middle of the night eating crackers over the sink because grief and snacks are cousins. They voted for dollars which are the only prayers that get answered on certain Tuesdays.

Grack did not pretend he had lost. He does not believe in losing. He believes in schedule adjustments. He slipped one last small trick into the pocket of the day: a coil of plastic strapping left where the wind would find it at the river’s edge, hoping for a photograph of a goose with a sadder story than its own. A magpie, insulted by the lack of style in the cruelty, pulled the strap into a tree and braided it into a nest as if to say that even foolishness could be cheap art with enough spit and dignity.

When Rill, Granite, and Tansy walked back to the square with the marigold braid slack and comfortable, their bodies made the sounds bodies make when they have earned a sit-down. They arranged themselves at a table that had served four teenagers last night and three physicians this morning and would serve a couple deciding to move away after the next paycheck. They did not eat. They drank water like it was a sacrament because sometimes that is exactly what it is. The day looked at them and tucked a napkin into its collar because it had been messy and planned to be again.

“You took it outside,” Granite said, and it was a benediction.

“I had to,” Rill said. “He wants everything under a description. I want noses involved.”

Tansy had stolen a packet of seeds from the planter without meaning to and then meant to. She opened it and poured a few into her palm like confetti that had gone to school. “He’ll be back at night,” she said. “He likes night best when it thinks it is helping him.”

“I know,” Rill said. “I have a date with shrimp.” They saw her face and added, “Not like that.” She laughed hard enough to make her bandage peel at the corner. They pressed it back down with a finger gentle as a vote.

When they finally let the day put them down in their boltholes, the spider had written a thin, outrageous line across the corner and dared anyone to breathe wrong. The marigold braid hung on a nail as if it had always been there and would go with the plaster if anyone moved it. The ring clicked quietly against copper in its sleep. Rill took up the old phone and did something brave that did not look like courage from the outside. They did not read the comments or the praise or the barbed compliments that ache later like splinters. They dialed a number the magpies had brought them from a wire: the one for the overnight crew that cleaned what people do not look at when they declare their city beautiful. A woman with a voice that had been in this country for fewer years than her pride answered as if she had been expecting them.

“I have a smell for you,” Rill said. “Four in the morning. Olive and Mason. Bring salt.”

“I have two kids,” the woman said. “They can sleep in the truck.”

“You’re a saint,” Rill said.

“No,” she said with a lightness that loved the accuracy. “I like to make things new. There is less arguing in it. I’ll bring limes,” she added, and no one who has ever cooked fish thought it was a joke.

They slept briefly and badly and adequately. The river counted in numbers that had grown friendly. The trains rehearsed their lines for an audience of trees. Grack moved through the city like a cat that has decided the chairs are all his and knocked one over just to keep his legend honest. In the dark before the birds begin their local news broadcast, Rill pulled on a sweater that remembered other dawns, tied the braid around their waist for no reason except that it felt like armor, and walked toward the alley with a bucket and the stupid kind of hope that survives even the best arguments against it.Chapter 7

Wind came early and opinionated, lifting the edges of the city like a rug to see what had gotten underneath. It was the sort of wind that made sandwich boards reconsider their life choices and hats wonder if they were vows or just costumes. Rill tasted it and found mountain in it and drywall, the familiar two-note chord of Front Range gusts arriving to rearrange light plans. The marigold braid on their shoulder thrummed as if the copper had been remembered by the sky. The Poudre counted faster when wind pressed its hand to the surface, not frightened, just busy.

The day had already put a list in their pocket without asking permission. There was a free concert that evening at the park, the kind with toddlers doing interpretive dance to the sound check and teenagers pretending they weren’t listening while being changed by a bassline anyway. There would be vendors selling tacos in paper boats and lemonade with ice that clacked like important decisions. There would be bins, the new kind with slanted lids like friendly lecterns, and the old kind that remembered when blue meant “trust this,” not “try your luck.” It was a field day for Grack, and it would be a test for the recipe cards. Rill tightened the strap on their string bag as if it were going to lift something heavier than tape and patience.

They went to the storage shed by the park where the city kept its event kit: folding tables, wavering signage, a tangle of cords that looked like an overbuilt nest. Tansy was already there, gangling, hair pinned up with two pencils because tradition insists on being practical sometimes. She had a clipboard and a talismanic roll of zip ties. She had slept maybe and did not regret how little. “We’re short on lids,” she announced as if that were a headline and not the beginning of a plan. “Someone borrowed green for a church picnic and then the wind borrowed the church.”

“Blue and gray can make a decent marriage if you tell them a good story first,” Rill said. They touched a stack of signs and the laminate sang in a tired alto. Signs get exhausted the way faces do when they have had to explain the same joy five days running and are not sorry, exactly, but would love a nap.

Grack had touched the kit in the night. He had the kind of audacity that looks like boredom. Rill could smell the residue he left when he shook the lids casually and whispered to the stickers that their glue did not have to be loyal. It would be a day of peels and reattachments if they weren’t careful. Rill pressed their thumbs onto a handful of marigold dots and laid one at each corner of the main sign. The copper in the braid warmed as if in assent. Small magic isn’t flash; it’s friction and permission.

“Granite?” Rill asked without looking up.

“Hauling the stage weights,” Tansy said. “If you ever want to see a man flirt with physics, go to the truck ramp behind the band shell. He says the weights are the only honest politicians in the county.” She grinned. “Marta sent a compost team. She wrote me a text that just said don’t let anyone with a mustache tell you heat is a myth. I love her.”

They made the square of the park ready the way you set a kitchen for a holiday before people arrive to bring chaos and cheese. Signs asked politely. Bins stood with their chins up. Water stations squared themselves as if to say we are here for you even if you brought a bottle you will forget on the grass. The magpies came to rehearse the day’s scripts. They tried out three lines each and discarded two because brevity is not only the soul of wit but a practical necessity when talking to a crowd.

By noon, a rumor had reached them that Grack was seeding the west side with twins. There would be a recycling bin and beside it another bin in the same color, same mouth, same posture, but with a slit so slightly different it would catch your cup by the lip and make you ashamed of your hands. There would be compost carts that smelled like mint for ten minutes and then like lies. There would be posters that declared a brand new category—Renewables—under which Grack would instruct people to put their guilt. The wind would carry laughter from conversations that had nothing to do with this at all and would be used as cover for mischief.

Rill sent the magpies like punctuation to all the run-on sentences Grack liked to write. They stationed birds above the twins so a flash of metallic cocking of head would catch a wandering eye. They gave Nora a fistful of marigold stickers and told her to wear one on her forehead which she did, solemnly, because when you decide to become a sign you must commit. They found Alma, the woman with the overnight crew, pushing a gray can that had never been gray in its heart. Her children walked beside the can as if it were a parade float no one else had the imagination to see. Rill greeted them as equals in uniform and handed Alma a stack of the recipe cards for dirt.

“Abuela said to use limes,” Alma reported as if they were discussing a potion and not a common sense.

“She’s right,” Rill said. “She often is.”

“I brought salt and a broom and a story,” Alma added. “What else.”

“A beat,” Rill said. “In case the lights decide to practice being fickle.”

“You have a magician?” Alma asked, skeptical in a way that always sounded like humor in her mouth.

“I have ten toddlers,” Rill said, and they both laughed because rhythm loves bodies that don’t know it is being asked for favors.

By three o’clock the park filled the way pies do when the crust is too generous and you think it will overflow and then it doesn’t; it just becomes something more than pretty. Dogs judged dogs and found them either wanting or perfect; babies stared at sunlight like philosophers with worn-out lungs; the band tuned and embarrassed themselves pleasantly on purpose. Vendors lined three aisles. The taco guys had a new shredder that sang at a pitch Rill could hear all the way from the fountain; the lemonade stand had a mountain of plastic lids the size of a casual sin. Rill visited the lemonade first and talked to the lids as if they were cousins. They coaxed them toward the truth. They told the teenagers scooping ice the story of why lids and cups are not lovers. The teenagers listened half with their ears and half with the way their hands moved when a new understanding has been set like a bowl next to the old one.

Grack began modestly because he was saving his energy. He walked among people like a breeze that learned spite. He switched two signs. He palmed a handful of straws and like a street performer made them appear behind a giddy boy’s ear, not out of kindness but because he liked the photo and liked to watch the mother’s face decide between scolding and laughing. He tilted a gray lid to balance badly so it would fall with a bang at the worst moment, and a small circle of older men would harrumph and talk about competence as if they weren’t standing in competence built and maintained for them. He didn’t sweat. He never sweats, which is how you know he’s either from a story or lying. Rill tried not to look at him directly. Attention is a resource.

At the southwest corner of the festival a set of bins stood exactly how he liked his villains: same clothes, different hearts. The twins. A blue that was the same blue. A lid slit that accepted, with too much grace, the wrong, and refused the right with a little slap. Rill felt the emotion rising in their chest that always threatened to make them ridiculous. They breathed. They went to the twins casually, whistling a song that aluminum cans know when they are halfway between use and music. They didn’t flip lids. They did not set their skill against the twist. Instead they stood beside the bins with two recipe cards and a roll of tape and made the signs feel loved beyond reason. They taped them in a way that would make the wind embarrassed to tug. They put a marigold on the corner and on a passing hoodie and on the water cooler and on their own shoulder because repetition is a spell.

And then they did what they had not done at a festival before: they spoke out loud. Not into a microphone, not to the crowd, but to the three people who approached the bins in a row with the air of students at an exam. They said, “I know it’s hard. The colors lie sometimes.” They said, “Put your lid here and your cup there and your food where it can become food again.” They said, “If you get it wrong, we will not scold you. We will correct you like a wheel corrects a sidewalk crack—gently, repeatedly, until our knees remember.” It felt reckless, to be that particular and that forgiving at the same time. It felt like handing everyone a small piece of dignity. Dignity is unsexy and essential.

People did it. They did it badly and then better. A girl with pink hair and a look on her face like a dare misread twice and then stuck around to correct the next three strangers, not out of penitence but because something in her liked the feeling of making a thing more right than it had been a minute ago. A man in a shirt that said Free Market asked what market the worms liked best and then flinched because he had made a joke and it had made him kinder. He stayed to help. Grack watched and added a five-beat delay to the water pressure at a sink in a vendor truck. His mischief came in friction, not grand malfunctions, because large disasters can sometimes unite a crowd. He knew better than to help Rill.

At five the wind tried to make a decision and failed. It gusted, dropped, and gusted again, the way a friend walks away and comes back to say one last thing three times. The pop-up tents along the west aisle lifted an inch, then another, like terrible birds practicing. Granite and a volunteer whose biceps had names they refused to tell anybody threw their bodies against the legs of the tents, their shoulders sturdy reminders that human weight is a good answer often. Tansy handed out tent weights like party favors. Someone tripped on a cord and did not fall because a stranger’s reflex put a palm on their elbow. The band did a blues about power strips and everybody clapped for the rhyme with surge.

Grack saved his better trick for the moment the headliner was about to start. He is a student of timing, for all his disdain for schedules. He loosened three bolts on the stage’s back rail, just enough that a hard gust would turn clang into choreography. He palmed a handful of plastic strapping from the back of a pallet because he had a soft spot for poetic repetition, and planned to tangle them around the feet of the dance floor so a video could capture the old trope of joy undercut by trash. He pulled at the idea of rain the way you can sometimes make a memory come faster by thinking about it; he cannot control weather, but the weather listens when malice leans in.

Rill had not meant to spend so much of themselves before sunset. Magic is not a bottomless thing even when it looks like it. They could feel the place where their hands wanted to shake and their jaw wanted to clench, which is how sprites get headaches. They made themselves drink water even though water is more delicious when you are not doing a job. They pressed their palm to the marigold copper and let it hum them back into a key they could sing. They did small absolutely necessary things, which are the lever and the fulcrum of any day. They picked up a stretch of stray film and put it where it would not become a flag. They held a baby while an exhausted woman tied her hair. They retrieved a paper plate from under a bench with a grace that made it look like a party trick; a nearby twelve-year-old took notes in her head and an hour later would imitate it.

As the headliner fiddled with his tuning in a way that felt like he was talking to himself and a friend far away, clouds came in not as a threat but as a possibility. The first drop of rain is always more narrative than meteorology in this climate. It hit the back of Alma’s hand. She looked at it the way a nurse looks at a bruise that will be nothing and decided to fetch the bigger broom anyway. She had barrels to empty before they became shipwrecks. Her kids, who had claimed a bench as a ship at noon and a school at two and a secret fort at four, now declared themselves a crew. Rill saw them and tucked that into the pocket behind their heart where the ring sometimes knocked for attention. Children declaring themselves useful is the closest thing to magic Rill ever pretended to understand.

Then the gust came, and the loosened bolts did exactly what they were told. The back rail of the stage left the vertical slightly to test its options like a man standing from a chair to stretch. Someone swore in the kind of voice you only use near wood that could hurt you. Tansy, light bones and heavy will, moved where she wasn’t expected. Her palm hit the rail, her weight made the angle change. Granite’s jaw did a new thing and he went low, shoulder under edge, lifting with the prehistoric intelligence of bodies that haul. The headliner stopped making music and made a face like a question mark. The crowd leaned forward, because this is when people either laugh or go quiet. The pop-up tents tried to come up; the planters that lined the park decided not to be ornamental for once. Alma shoved her bin under the tent leg nearest her and put her foot on it, a pirate claiming. Her children copied her without irony. Nora took off her jacket and wrapped it around the sharp corner of a vendor’s sign so no one would meet it with their temple. Marta, who had shown up because she has a gift for being where bolts go wrong, materialized like a sensible curse and put a wrench where it belonged, the wind trying and failing to pull the words out of her mouth. The rail settled back into its righteous seat and sighed.

Grack clicked his tongue in the polite way of a man who has just been told a restaurant is out of the special. He put his palm against the next trick—strapping around ankles—and the magpies dropped from the air like a bad idea losing confidence. Three birds went for the plastic at once and made something of it. They weaved the strap like ribbon around two tent legs. It looked decorative and was practical. They slid another length through the hole of the rail and pretended it was purposeful, because birds know that the human eye forgives when it suspects fashion. An old woman clapped her hands and called it art, and lo, it was saved.

The rain decided it was a rumor and left. The wind decided it had said its piece. The crowd exhaled tangibly, the way a cityhive exhales when the queen chooses to stay. The band began because there wasn’t anything else to do. Rill closed their eyes and let sound reorder their cells. There is a kind of music that teaches even machines about grace. The bailer at the MRF listens when a human sings in D for long enough. The belt that rattles because one roller grew bored calms when a bass finds a pocket for a bridge. Rill believed this and did not argue with themselves about the ridiculousness of believing it.

Between songs, Grack came to the volunteer table as if to ask for a schedule. He stood, hands behind his back, the posture of someone who has never had to clean a spill. His eyes were full of petty weather. “You’ve developed a taste for carnivals,” he said, his voice softened by the necessity of not being heard by people who would find him disappointing in long form. “I hope you know what this is.”

“It’s the only way Americans know how to learn anymore,” Rill said mildly. “We put learning next to food and music and pretend we stumbled on it.”

He smiled in a way that could be mistaken for a nod. “You’re very graceful when you must be. It will make the failures prettier. I may enjoy that.”

“You will enjoy nothing if you remember you have a body,” Rill said, doing the rude thing of showing him his own edges.

He leaned forward as if to confide, a performance he saved for when he wanted to pretend intimacy. “This is adorable,” he said softly. “You’re making the work into a game so you can live with it. I will give you a better game. We’ll play flood.”

Rill kept the look on their face from changing by counting twice. “The river is not your toy,” they said, and the word toy was a deliberate insult.

“Your river is a schedule,” he said, amused. “Releases, allocations, calls. City against farmer against electricity against trout. If I nudge one memo, if I whisper one adjective into a recall, if I make one gate stick for an afternoon, you’ll have photographs you cannot sing your way out of. You will have a smell you cannot make into a recipe card. You will have a story about negligence with your name stapled to it.”

He had found the next loop, and Rill hated him for his accuracy. They felt their own knowledge of water rights, particle-thin and insufficient. Sprites feel rivers with their teeth; they do not always know where the paper lives that tells rivers when to speak. They did not let him see the gap. “You don’t even like mud,” they said.

“I like camera angles,” he returned. “Mud is cooperative if you don’t ask it to tell the truth.”

He took a step back, not out of respect but to widen his field of carelessness. He wanted to be seen leaving. He wanted Rill to watch him go so that their imagination could be conscripted to do half his labor for him. Rill didn’t watch. They focused on a child trying to decide if napkins were food. They guided her hand gently to green. They smiled at a father who breathed out in relief when he didn’t have to be the expert in front of his own kid. They let the music rearrange their spine. They made a decision that would cost them sleep but buy them leverage. They would go to the river after the show. They would ask names they had not wanted to put in their mouth. They would find the gate and figure out whether it could be made to stick, and what to do when a shadow put its thumb on the hinge.

The show finished without further theater. That is the way small victories come: anticlimactic and sticky with lemonade. The bins were full in a way that made the recycling laugh under its breath and the compost hum and the trash a little embarrassed. Alma’s kids fell asleep in the curve of a cart like two commas giving a sentence permission to stop. Volunteers debriefed in the language of people who had found a task that matched their metabolism. Granite lifted the last tent leg because it wanted to argue and he was not in the mood for debate. Tansy, who had emptied the word adorable of its bite for the day by overusing it until it was exhausted, fell onto the grass and stared at a star and said she was going to name it After-Lunch.

Rill slipped away. They are good at leaving without offense. The river took them in, as it always did, without making them explain. It smelled of old snow and deer and the paws of neighborhood dogs. Downstream, the black of night pooled like a bruise, but the surface still counted. Rill crouched where the bank leaned and put their fingers into the water like an apology. They did not do magic first. They did the humiliating thing of admitting they did not know. They said the names they did know: the old canal that runs like a rumor along the edge of town, the ditch company with a meeting table sticky with coffee, the utility up on a hill with a view of lights. The river was not a person. It did not nod or turn its face. It did cut their skin cold and then warmer where the shallows had learned to store sun.

A flashlight bobbed in their periphery. One of the anglers who loved twilight stepped onto the bank with tenderness, the way you step when you’re either in love or in waders. He was a human in waders, tall and quiet, the kind who does not use the word sport when he means joy. He saw Rill without seeing. He lifted his chin the way men do when they want to say hello without telling the night the secret of their voice. They lifted their chin back because community is often made of gestures between strangers. The angler’s line made that whisper that sounds like silk remembering it came from a worm. A fish took and didn’t. The angler smiled anyway, because some days you are the story even if the end isn’t the one anyone would brag about.

Rill stood. They let the water drip from their fingers without dramatics. They wrote the word gate on their palm with a nail. They told the river they would be back with a plan and a person who could speak into microphones about flows without making anyone cry. They whispered the dangerous thing you say to an adversary if you are going to fight them without becoming them: “I see you.” The river does not need to hear that, but Grack did, and he would hear it if they breathed it in air.

On the way back into town, Rill passed the alley that had been shrimp the night before. It smelled like work done, like bleach and lime and pride. Alma had been there. The city had paid her for the hour. Rill would find a way for her to be paid for the story too. Under the light, a chalk word had been written in a hand that knew how to keep recipe quantities aligned and toddlers entertained: mañana. It always means two things here. It means later. It means yes.

They slept late by sprite standards and not at all by human ones, which is to say the morning found them after it had already fed the pigeons. The marigold braid lay on the chair the way a guest naps with one eye open. The ring clicked once as if to remind them that vows are mostly about what you do in the middle. A message waited that the magpies had instructed the old phone to pretend it received: Marta, who does not trust electronics beyond their willingness to heat and cool, had told someone to tell someone to tell Rill to meet her at the headgate on the north ditch at ten. Rill washed their face in the sink that knows their breath and went.

The headgate was a rectangle like all headgates, practical, unattractive, beautiful in the way of a hinge that lets a door be itself. A rusted wheel made promises no one believed. Marta waited with a man whose hat had a fish stitched onto it with affection, and whose hands had the surety of someone who has stood in the same spots four times a year for forty years. He had the kind of plain face that does not get photographed outside of school albums. His name was Raul; he did not waste it on introductions until he had a reason to.

“You the one with the bracelets,” he said to Rill, squinting not against the light but against a category error.

“I am the one who asks favors of machines,” Rill said, because it was closer to a statement a man like Raul might not dismiss.

He nodded once, which counted as welcome. He put a hand on the gate as if it were the shoulder of a mule. “She sticks when she’s tired,” he said. “And she’s tired because somebody upstream forgot to bleed the air or forgot on purpose, depending on what you think of their memory. Paper says we can call and they will open because a man drew these lines with a pencil one afternoon and another man nodded and everyone went home and then the picnic got rained out. Paper works until wind reads it. Then wind works. Today we have both.”

Grack had not yet shown his hand, but there was a fingerprint where there had been none. The padlock had a sheen of new that kept looking like oil and was not. The wheel had a hum like a fly in a jar—low and constant and possibly imagined. Rill put their palm on the spoke as if it were a friend they might dance with badly and not embarrass. They did not wrench. They asked. They coaxed the little discomforts to say their names. Sand had done what sand does. Someone had not greased a thing that prefers to be greased because budgets are for shiny problems and hinges are just hinges. A spider had moved into a corner and caused no relevant trouble. The river licked the lower edge as if it were gossiping with a door.

“What will he do?” Marta asked, not polite and not fearful.

“He’ll stick us,” Rill said. “At the worst hour for someone’s camera and the exact hour when people will have the least attention to spare for nuance. He’ll give Old Town a puddle to talk about and Bellvue a trickle and everybody a story about who gets what and why. He wants us to savage each other with words that feel like justice and are actually just tiredness.”

Raul snorted. It was not derision; it was recognition of a behavior he did not bother to dignify. He put his hand on the wheel and turned the minimum. The gate squeaked and moved like a reluctant relative. The water answered without drama. A small surge, like a nod. Rill felt a pressure they had learned to trust enter their teeth. They looked downriver and saw Grack’s shadow not long, not tall, but present where it should not be, like someone else’s initials carved where you keep your keys. They did not announce him. They leaned harder into their job.

“Teach me the part that is paper,” Rill said to Marta. “Introduce me to the phone number that always gets answered and the one that never does. Show me where the arguments are kept when they’re not in this ditch. Let me learn who calls whom and why. If I’m going to fight him here, I can’t just be a rumor blowing in with good intentions and leaving with an anecdote.”

Marta held their gaze. It is harder to ask a human for help than it is to ask a machine for a favor; machines say no and don’t mind you for asking. Humans bring their days. “I’ll introduce you,” she said. “And you’ll have to listen to the history about frogs and access roads and a man who married a bad idea about crops. And you’ll have to remember that some of the people who will help you wear boots and some will have opinions about plastic straws that are not elegant and still like the river better than Grack does.”

“I like anyone who likes the river better than Grack does,” Rill said, and Raul laughed the smallest laugh a man like him allows in the presence of water and strangers.

Around noon a cloud moved like a chair being pulled out, and the light changed and everybody in the city looked up as if someone had said their name. Grack took the moment and pinched. You couldn’t see the pinch. You felt its consequence. The upstream gate’s actuator made a sound like a sigh you don’t mean to let out in a meeting. The wheel here complained, politely. The river did the thing rivers do when men decide on its cadence. It hesitated and tried to remember its job. People in Old Town would not notice for thirty minutes and then suddenly there would be three conversations at once in the coffee line about puddles, fairness, and whether river is a verb. A woman out by the plant nursery would look down her row and realize that one of the beds looked more thirsty than the rest and would call a cousin who would call Raul and Raul would already be here, as he was.

Rill could make a few promises to metal. They could make a few to numbers. They could make a few to breath. They put both hands on the wheel and got out of the way. The marigold braid laughed because copper loves being near an honest job. Alma’s crew was sleeping for once and deserved it; Nora’s hands were inked; Granite’s shoulders needed a chair and got one only grudgingly. This loop would be handled by a different kind of choreography. Marta placed a call and said three words that mean nothing in a poem and everything in a drought year. Raul told the gate an old joke about a mule and a jar of molasses and the gate’s stubbornness softened just enough to be something different than malice. Rill leaned their ear toward the sluice and, because they are ridiculous as often as they are practical, they hummed in D, the key the blower had learned to like. It is possible the metal rolled easier for it. It is possible it did not care. Humans did. That is what mattered.

When the trick failed to make a photograph in time, when puddles did not stage on command, when the rumor arrived and was inconveniently met by steam from Marta’s pile and by a teenager explaining polymer chains in the library to a grandmother who had grown suspicious of products that call themselves eco, Grack walked into the shade and decided to hate this version of Fort Collins for an afternoon. He kicked a rock, because even spirits of spite succumb to the petty. He drafted a new loop with less weather and more insult. He would go for the little public bathrooms, the stubborn block structures with murals and good intentions, and he would whisper a lie to the hand dryers. He would make them blow cold no matter the season and he would make the paper towels jam at exactly the hour teenagers needed them. It would be small. It would be petty. It would be perfect. He hated that he had to keep choosing small. He had wanted flood. He would take damp hands and make them into a metaphor with teeth.

Rill did not know that yet. They stood with Marta and Raul at the gate and watched the river remember itself without applause. They counted along to calm their anger about what they couldn’t see. Thirty-two. Forty-nine. Nine. Thirteen. Numbers like a rosary nobody updated and didn’t need to. Mateo’s voice came into their ear as if he had figured out how to use magpie channels the way he used walkie-talkies with his friends. He said, “We have the school assembly on Friday. Can Abuela talk about tamales and trash, or will the principal be boring?”

“She should talk,” Rill said immediately. “She is the opposite of boring. We need her recipe for waiting.”

“Okay,” he said. “Also tell your enemy I learned a new word and I’m not afraid of him. I can say infrastructure.”

“Don’t say it too often,” Rill advised. “It makes adults feel like they have to sit down. Say ‘gate’ instead.”

“Gate,” Mateo repeated with relish as if it were a candy he’d thought he didn’t like. “Gate, gate, gate.” He laughed, and the laugh went down the wire in a way that made two magpies argue about whether laughter has a flavor they can carry.

In the late afternoon, when shadow had re-entered the city like a tired dog who had forgiven a door, Rill found Nora at the print shop, cutting recipe cards into a new shape. She was making them round now, for no reason except that circles make people feel as if they are being let in on something. “You’re going to get pulled into water,” Nora said without preamble. “You’re going to become an expert in three nouns you do not enjoy.”

“I know,” Rill said. “I want to build jokes into them so my mouth does not get dry.”

“Do that,” she said. “We will pass them out in the bathrooms so Grack’s small will find itself surrounded by bigger.”

They both looked up at the same moment, not at sound but at a lack. The blower at the MRF hiccuped in the distance. A child up the block dropped a soda and nothing hissed because the lid was on correctly. The day saw them notice and wagged its tail.

“Alma texted,” Nora added, remembering. “She said, ‘Tomorrow. Lime,’ and then three lemons because she couldn’t find the lime emoji. That is the best thing anyone has said to me today.”

“It’s a plan,” Rill said. “It’s always a plan.”

They left the print shop with a stack of circles that smelled like ink and promises. The sun chose orange because it knew it would look good in the windows on Mountain. The marigold braid felt warm on Rill’s skin in the way copper does when it has been forgiven for being itself. They walked toward the square, toward the park, toward the river, toward the headgate. They walked toward Grack’s next small insult with their own small readiness and a body made of long practice. They would not flood. They would not dazzle. They would do the part of the job that no one films and still, sometimes, catches a breeze.Chapter 9

The morning stretched its joints with the particular complaint of a city that had danced the night before. The park grass still showed the geometry of folded chairs and sleeping dogs, and the bins wore their fullness like medals. Rill rose later than a rumor and earlier than a headline. Their first breath tasted of coffee drifting in from three corners at once and of a rain that had changed its mind at the state line. The marigold braid warmed against their collarbone as if to say that copper wakes cranky and then chooses manners. From the alley below, Alma’s cart rattled past on its way to a job that would be invisible by noon and indispensable by dinner.

There is a particular kind of mischief that lives in tiled rooms. It requires no audience and thrives on impatience. Rill felt it as they crossed the square, a sulking in the air vents, a resentment in the cinder block. The first bathroom door groaned open with the theatrical reluctance of a teenager being asked to come to the table. Inside, the hand dryer blew a breath as cold as a doctor’s stethoscope. The paper towel dispenser had chosen martyrdom and jammed its own heart for effect. On the mirror, a child’s handprint had dried to a small, stubborn star.

Grack had come and gone without perfume. He liked bathrooms because they were democratic and because the stories born there were always told in the voice of annoyance, which is his favorite rhetoric. He had whispered to the thermostats in the hand dryers that the season was wrong. He had taught the paper to mistrust its serrations. He had slipped a smear of something the color of tired into the hinge, just enough to make every door insist upon its presence.

Rill did not declare war on soap dispensers. They did not swing the marigold braid like a censor at a procession. They opened the janitor’s closet the way a polite thief opens a cupboard in a kitchen they have been told is theirs. The cart stood with its mop like a prayer, with its box of tools that had fixed more than screws. Rill left a note where human eyes would find it and not feel haunted: “Borrowing the hex key. Returning before lunch. Thank you for dignities no one applauds.” Notes are spells when they are the exact size of reality. They tightened the small screw that tells a paper towel to be generous. They put their palm to the dryer and hummed low until the fan remembered summer. They wiped the mirror with the side of their sleeve and watched their own face go from fog to fact and did not linger.

In the second bathroom the problem was not mechanical. Two teenagers were doing the choreography of clean hands reluctantly, shoulders high, faces arranged around disdain like a picture frame. The dryer blew cold and they laughed with the kind of laughter that says, “What did you expect?” Rill stood between the sinks as if they had always been there and said, “You ever been good at a thing you had to practice even when it was boring?” The taller one shrugged toward sneakers that had learned their job on a basketball court. The other lifted a chin as if to say that their eyeliner was a steadfast friend. Rill pointed at the towels. “We’re fixing the machines. Until then, consider it an upper-body workout.” The taller one made a face and tore two towels with his whole hand and then grinned when the paper snapped satisfyingly. Boredom surrendered. The dryer softened into lukewarm and took the edge off the day. The teenagers left a wet constellation on the floor. Rill tracked it in their head like a map and did not scold.

By nine, the magpies had made a route of the restrooms. They landed on doorframes with the offended grace of nobles asked to stand in a line. When a dryer blew cold at the wrong moment, a bird would hop onto the metal casing and peck once, as if to shame the thermostat into adulthood. It worked in a way that made no sense and sense is not required for everything. Alma’s crew added the bathrooms to their circuit without being told. “We are the shy backbone,” Alma texted Nora, who pasted the phrase in cut vinyl and pressed it onto a drawer at the print shop. Rill saved the hex key to return with respect and wrote the number that fit the dryer’s panel onto the inside of their wrist because bodies want to be lists when the city is loud.

At eleven, the school smelled like floor wax and oranges. The assembly ran on a clock that could not be seen but was as loud as a cowbell in the minds of the teachers. Rill stood in the cafeteria doorway and became a draft. Mateo bounced on the balls of his feet by the stage, holding in a river’s worth of desire to run. Abuela Lety took the microphone with the calm of a woman who had washed it after a long line of men’s mouths and refused to be embarrassed about the necessity. She wore marigolds in her hair the way some people wear alarm clocks, practical and bright.

“We make tamales,” she said, and the students leaned in because the word was food and a story and an auntie at once. “It is a recipe, but it is also a way to be with each other. You cannot punish a pot into boiling faster. You cannot make masa care about your impatience. You put what is right where it belongs. You don’t throw the corn husk at your dog because you are bored of carrying to the trash. You do not put the fork that lies to you in the green bin because you want to feel good.” She grinned at the rumble of laughter. “You let your hands learn a rhythm. After a while, the rhythm does your thinking for you. You become a person who does not mind carrying, because you learned that the long way is also time to talk.”

She paused and looked out at the bleachers as if each child were a member of a jury she was teaching the concept of mercy. “This is a city that can cook,” she said. “It can cook dirt into food and food into bodies and bodies into work that feeds us back. It cannot do it with arguing. It can do it with hands.”

Grack had stolen a wire on the soundboard so that the microphone would crackle on the word hands. He wanted static to be the punctuation mark. The sound faltered and the janitor, a man who had taught three generations to mistake him for a piece of the building, stepped out from the folding chairs and tapped a button with his thumb. The crackle died, unceremonious. Abuela’s voice poured like beans. There was a moment when every child saw the man for the first time as a person and not an appliance, and Rill tucked it away for later because such moments are currency.

Mateo spoke at the end with the gravity of a NASA broadcast. “Compost is tomorrow,” he said, and someone clapped before remembering they were supposed to wait. He waved like a politician born to a small neighborhood and handed the microphone back to its cord with respect. In the hallway afterward, he threatened Rill with a spelling test on infrastructure and then hugged them without permission because there are permissions that exist only to be ignored.

Afternoon dragged its sun across the street like a lazy suitcase. The bathrooms held. The dryers blew warm in a way that made children under them go blissful-eyed. The paper unjammed because Rill had told it a bedtime story about serrations and patience. Grack pivoted in the way that keeps adversaries honest; he whispered to the elevator in the municipal building that it had a right to be moody. It stopped twice between floors just long enough to make a clerk doubt her ability to go home on time. Rill pressed their hand to the elevator’s skin when they passed and told it that fear is a poor diet. It shivered and got over itself.

At two-thirty, Rill met the version of the river that fit in a lecture hall. The hydrology lab smelled like whiteboard ink and solved arguments. A woman in a cardigan that was almost a banner stood before a topographic model on a table where tiny gates moved toy water. She was called Priya in a city that remembered a thousand names badly, and she bit off each syllable as if it were worth chewing. “We manage a chorus,” she said, gesturing to the model. “This ditch sings in G, the utility sings in E-flat. The fish prefer silence and then contralto. When someone throws in a cowbell, we pretend to call it improvisation.”

Rill liked her at once because she did not pretend rivers obeyed metaphors except hers. They asked the questions that had teeth. Who writes the emails. Who picks up the phone. Who sulks and refuses to answer unless the caller ID spells a last name they married into. Priya rolled her eyes toward a stack of binders that had eaten math. “There’s a consortium that thinks it is God and might be most days,” she said dryly. “There’s a guy named Joel who can fix a valve with a sandwich. There’s a woman in legal with the stare of ten winter mornings who can tell you exactly how your story dies if you use the wrong verb.” She slid a post-it across the table to Rill as if it were contraband. “These are phone numbers, not wishes. Use them sparingly. Or often. I haven’t decided which would be more effective.”

Rill looked at the post-it like a relic. It had names that were not magical and would save whole afternoons. “He’s going to push the gate at an hour when you are on a call with a donor,” they said. “He will attempt to make it look like you forgot a child at a bus stop.” Priya raised one eyebrow, a motion she used like punctuation. “Then let’s act as if we did not,” she said. She drilled her students with a murmured chain of instructions that sounded like the alphabet was learning to march. She looked at Rill and said, “I don’t believe in you. But I believe in whatever it is you make people do, so it’s the same thing.”

The MRF tour the next morning arrived like a group walk into a haunted house where everyone knows the ghosts are friendly. Clipboards checked their own boxes. Children knelt to watch rollers flick away plastic film with fingers that were not fingers. A man in a hat that made him look earnestly foreign to his own city asked a question about profitability that did not sound like accusation. Granite walked apart and stood near the bailer with a posture that kept strangers from climbing onto anything that would squash them for their optimism. Tansy had sharpied names onto vests so people could gossip efficiently and kindly.

Grack, bored by being ignored, nibbled at morale with a clever, ineffective trick. He arranged for the sound of a distant radio to leak into the tour through a wall. It was a talk show from another town with a man who sounded like a bag of gravel being poured downhill while crash cymbals considered their options. He wanted voices in the ears to make people believe they were more tired than they were. It did not land because a woman on the tour lifted her baby so the baby could see the cardboard ride into shape, and the baby made a noise that cancels radio men. Babies are a better rhetoric than anyone admits.

In the afternoon, the city wore heat like a coat. The bathrooms stayed noble. Alma’s crew rested, a thing that should be holy and is not. Nora dropped off a stack of circles that explained compost to the inside of medicine cabinets and the insides of teenagers’ lockers by force of will. Rill walked a stretch of alley and found the place where a grease dumpster had been told to lean. They straightened its posture, put a marigold on its corner as if to give it a sash, and told it in a whisper that it contained one of the city’s best stories. Dumplings, soup, biscuits, a hundred dinners stood behind its steel like ghosts that refuse to haunt.

By evening, Grack made good on his threat to be small and cruel. He walked into the public bathroom by the skate park and told every hand dryer to believe in January. He stacked three empty soap boxes in the closet so that the one with the pumps would catch and abandon its effort. He told the door to shudder whenever a teenager laughed. The first girl to feel cold air on her wet hands swore in a language she had learned from a cousin who worked in roofing. Rill stood with her and said, “We’re going to fix it. It is not your job to forgive machines.” They loosened the tiny panel that hides a woman’s work and warmed the coil with a breath and the coil remembered that summer is a verb. The girl rolled her eyes for form and then smiled because betrayal had been averted before it could become an identity. Outside, two boys jumped a trash can and failed gloriously and laughed so hard they forgot to be impressive.

Tansy had organized what she called a janitorial flash mob, which sounds like an insult until you’ve seen ten people with keys and rags move through tile like a weather system. City custodians, a librarian with a vendetta against sticky floors, a barista who had conquered five cappuccino machines with a single allen wrench, the janitor from the school with his square jaw and democratic wrench, and two grad students who had written papers on aerosolized nonsense stormed the bathrooms with joy. They left behind neat stacks of the recipe circles on the window ledges, circles that said in Nora’s admired handwriting, “You are what you keep working.” The hand dryers made peace with the season and agreed to help.

News arrived from the headgate not by phone but by beetle. It crawled over Rill’s knuckles like a thought that had decided to become a task. The upstream valve had hiccuped. Raul had used a cuss that felt like a prayer. Priya had a meeting and had texted Joel with a sandwich. The river would behave in twenty-seven minutes if the wind did not interfere by sighing at the wrong time. Rill felt the itch of two places desire them. They put their hand on the bathroom mirror and the mirror did not offer advice. Choices are not a machine to be coaxed into grace. They left the janitorial troop to its quiet pageantry and went toward the water.

At the canal head, Raul was a piece of bronze sculpture that someone had decided to animate. He had his hands on the wheel with a familiarity that could not be taught at a desk. The chain that tells gates to trust hands rattled in a good way. “Sand in the gear,” he said without drama. “Paper says one thing. Dust says another. We live here with the dust. Paper lives in Denver.” He sounded affectionate even when he was not. Rill listened for the curl of malice in the metal at the edges and found it in the smallest place, a burr where one man had been lazy or rushed or punished for being neither. They filed it with a tone that was not exactly sound. They felt ridiculous, which is the price of doing a thing that looks like magic even to those who can perceive the work. Raul grunted and nodded and did not ask them to prove anything.

They watched the water find its voice again, not exquisite and not documentary. The best triumphs are those that spare you a paragraph. Rill stood with their hands on a railing worn smooth by two centuries of need and thought about how this would not end, not ever. You push in one place and the other opens, and then a boy grows into his stride and you are allowed to lean elsewhere, for a week or a winter.

Grack leaned on the railing three blocks away and pretended it was the same one. He had been thwarted in large loops twice and resented it the way tall men resent low doorways. He would not forgive or forget because forgiving isn’t in his diet. He looked at the lamplight puddling across a mural and debated whether graffiti had the patience for him today. He settled on the bathrooms, again, because there is a narcotic pleasure in asking a machine to be petty and having it obey. He reached for the wall plate with the screws and stopped. Someone had taped a circle to it. It said, “Clean hands are infrastructure,” and the scotch tape had been pressed down by a child’s thumb. He laughed in spite of himself, which is a thing he hates. The laughter came out wrong and made two pigeons rebuild their day.

By the time the stars tried on their nightly outfits, Rill had walked two loops around a city that felt like a promise repeated under its breath. They dropped into their bolthole with the heaviness of a sack of flour being set down gently. The phone had three messages: a photograph of a compost pile from Marta with steam rising like a victory flag; a voice memo from Priya that said “I said the verb flow out loud in a meeting and did not get fired, so we are calling that a win”; and a giggle from Mateo that ended in the word gate being whispered dramatically as if it were contraband candy.

They did not answer. They put the marigold braid around the chair, the ring in the pocket behind their heart where it clicked against the day, and their palm against the plaster as if the wall needed to be told a secret. They told it the secret of not being defeated by smallness. The wall took the secret with the practicality of a building. The spider in the corner finished a line and tied it off like a sentence. Rill slept poorly and well. They dreamed of bathrooms with warm air and chopped cilantro and a ditch wheel that spun only when asked and a stage that apologized to the wind for having been cross.

Morning had the school assembly’s aftertaste and the headgate’s grease under its nails. Rill put on a sweater that had been forgiven for several stains and walked toward the library because Tansy had told them to and also because the library always smells like a polite future. There was a Fix-It evening tucked between the stacks, what Nora had named a Night Market of Repairs because she understood that people only go to meetings when snacks or music or the promise of belonging are involved. People brought lamps with bad habits and ripped knees and hearts that had started to think in the language of throw away. A boy with a soldering iron showed a man with a doctorate how to pretend to be careful and then actually be careful. An old woman taught three teenagers the knot that would keep their canvas bags from becoming tragedies. A man who had only ever repaired his own courage learned to take apart a toaster and smiled like a thief at his new power. Rill moved among them like an air current and touched a wire into acknowledging it was not the enemy. Grack stayed outside because nothing makes him itch like competence multiplied.

In a corner, Nora had set up a table with circles and tape and the hex keys that fit the hand dryers. “Take one,” she told every adult who stopped. “And take an extra for a friend so that later you have a thing you can use instead of an opinion.” People laughed defensively and then actually took them. Alma’s children climbed under the table and pretended they were mechanics for a fleet of invisible bikes. Abuela Lety answered a child’s question about corn with a parable and then pinned a marigold to the child’s hoodie without consulting any theories of consent because she was a grandmother and that is a job description which includes epaulettes.

Priya arrived with a folded map both literal and unnecessary. She put it on the table mostly so people would look at something while she told them a story that did not need pictures. “Water is not a pipe,” she said to a small circle of citizens who had not thought of it that way and now could not stop. “It’s a calendar and a knife and an argument and a lullaby. It answers to court documents and to moss. If you want to help me, you will talk about gates as if they are neighbors and not villains, and you will ask why the willow on the bank is our business and not just a view.” The handful of people who kept the city’s patient anger like a pet set it down for a minute and listened. Rill watched truth pass like a bowl of stew around a table, one spoon, no drops.

When the library lights flickered obediently at closing, Nora packed the hex keys into a tin with a flourish that made them feel like candy. Granite stacked chairs and made them look like they had fulfilled their purpose nobly. Tansy looked at her clipboard and realized she had not written down a single name and did not care. Rill stood in the doorway and looked at the street and felt Grack in the gutter like a cat under a car deciding whether to move. He had chosen his next insult. He was going to make a crosswalk signal refuse to change for a minute at a time and then for two and then for five. He was going to teach people to run in front of cars when they were late for daycare and to hate their feet for not being wings. He wanted to turn the city’s rhythm against itself in measures small enough to be dismissed.

Rill placed a circle on the pole of the first crosswalk because they had run out of cleverness and had decided to attempt sincerity. The sticker read, “We will wait with you.” It was not poetry. They felt silly. A woman with a stroller rolled up and read it out loud and smiled and looked at the pole differently and did not cross against the light, and the driver of the first car in line exhaled the resentment they had kept stored for the moment and did not rev. Sometimes being silly works.

On the way back to their bolthole, Rill passed the MRF and heard the hum it makes when it has not been asked to be admirable. The belts yawned, the magnets sang, the cardboard made purring sounds when stacked neatly because physics has a sense of humor. In the night, a moth landed on the marigold braid where it hung and thought it had finally reached a small sunrise. Rill shut their eyes to practice being brave in the unglamorous way that does not come with trumpets. They were going to have to say infrastructure to people without making them sleepy. They were going to have to be boring in exactly the right quantity. They were going to have to love the bathrooms and the gates and the small reasons people feel put upon. They were going to have to catch Grack’s petty midair and hand it back to him wrapped in dignity until he got bored and reached for something else, and then they would be there too.

In the hour when delivery trucks learn the alleys by heart, the phone shook itself awake with a call from an unknown number. Rill answered because sprites do. The voice was the sort you get when a person has breathed chemical sweetness for three decades and still insists on spelling. “This is Joel,” it said, chewing on a sandwich and on a vowel at once. “Priya says you sing to metal. If you’ve got a minute tomorrow, I’ve got a blower that could use a lullaby. I don’t believe in that kind of thing, but also my mother used to talk to her sewing machine and it never ate her fabric, so maybe I do.”

Rill smiled into the dark where the spider was already asleep and could not be roused for applause. “I’ll bring a song,” they said. “You bring a wrench.” Joel grunted the universal male yes that sounds like a truck downshifting kindly. Rill put the phone under the acorn, not to weigh it down, but to let it remember trees. They turned on their side to face the wall that had learned their secrets and let the weight of a city they belonged to rearrange their ribs until breath could do its modest miracle. In the graveled hiss of sleep arriving, they heard Grack pace the way impatient men pace before a meeting they plan to ruin. They heard Alma’s limes click together in a bag like marbles deciding to behave. They heard the river spell numbers that had never once been convinced by a speech. They fell into a rest that contained none of the drama of heroes and all of the practice of a person who knows there is a bathroom to be made bearable at seven, a gate to be persuaded at ten, a circle to be taped at noon, and a lullaby to be hummed into a blower whose feelings would never make a magazine but whose grace would save three teenagers from rolling their eyes at the wrong time.
