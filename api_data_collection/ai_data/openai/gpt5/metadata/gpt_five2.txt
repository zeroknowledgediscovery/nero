They called the building La Casa Azul, though the paint had faded to the color of old rain. From the street it looked like a stack of shoe boxes with iron bars for lace. Every window had a view of the same corner store, the same cracked sidewalk, the rubbery shine of plantains in a vitrine. At night the coquí frogs stuttered out their names, over and over, calling to each other and to whoever was still awake and listening. In the mornings, the kids lined up and shuffled to school with hair still damp and eyes already hungry.

Lía had been told she was seventeen, then sixteen, then eighteen when somebody needed her to sign a permission slip. The numbers didn’t cling to her. Names did. The name her mother chose was Lía, three letters like a light step. The last name came from a file. She had a second name too, a private one, that showed up in letters she never opened. She kept them in a shoe box under her bunk. When the air in the dormitory was too thick and hot to sleep in, she would sneak the box out and count the stamps, the countries. New Jersey. Florida. Siempre Florida. The envelopes had a sweet mold smell that made her nose itch.

On the long chalkboard by the kitchen someone had once written SANTO DOMINGO in pink chalk. Half the kids had erased it and replaced it with SAN JUAN, SAN JUAN, SAN JUAN, because they were loyal like that. The truth was, the island turned them into its own wild mix—San Juan and all the towns they’d heard about. They wanted the sea to claim them, even if the sea didn’t know their names.

On the first day of the new term, the fan in the kitchen quit. A cook with copper braids, who everyone called Titi Nena, cooked eggs with the door open, and the whole building smelled like oil and onion and burned pepper. “Eat,” she said. “And don’t take extras for the pigeons.” She had a gold tooth that flashed like a coin when she smiled. She loved the kids enough to make rules.

At the end of the line, Lía balanced a chipped plate and an orange. She put both down when the director, Alma Rosa, snapped her fingers and said, “You. Girl. You need to sign for your uniform. It’s in my office.”

“It’s tight,” said Lía without looking up. She liked to announce the truth first, so nobody else would get the pleasure. “It makes my back feel like a pastelillo that’s going to burst.”

“You complain like a rich lady,” Alma Rosa said. She had a voice like a broom. Good for sweeping and warning. “Go after you eat. Don’t disappear on me.”

The disappearing joke was old and the kids laughed anyway. Them, with their pockets inside out and their shoelaces trailing, they loved a joke that didn’t need a new battery.

If anyone had asked what she wanted, Lía would have said a voice that filled a room. She had a cheap radio that she kept under her bunk with the letters. In that small dark space, with the mattress slats like ribs above her, she’d dial through the frequencies to find the voices that lived between songs. Announcers with slow voices that made everything sound gold, the slither of vinyl, a trumpet that could thread a needle. The songs were a map. “Mira,” she’d whisper to herself, to nobody, “eso. That’s the sound of a street before it rains.”

At school, the only place that seemed warmer than the rest was the music room. It was tucked behind the auditorium, past a tangle of stacked chairs and a stage that smelled like old curtains. The door was always jammed and a kid had to put a shoulder into it to make it sigh open. Inside, the room had three windows that faced a wall of bougainvillea, which was better than facing a wall of wall. The teacher was called don Jacinto, although he was no don in any official sense. He had a mustache that could hide a guitar pick and the habit of talking to instruments as if they were neighbors. “Tranquilo, mi amor,” he would whisper to a trumpet whose valves stuck when the day got sticky. “This is not your fault.”

“Sir,” said Lía the first time he allowed her to linger after class. “I just want to be near them.” She couldn’t name the feeling otherwise. It wasn’t about playing. It was the idea that things could be taught to release other things. Holes in wood and brass that made holes in the air. Openings. The idea made the skin on her arms prickle.

“Then sit,” he said, holding up a hand before she offered to fetch coffee or carry a drum. “The last boy who wanted to ‘be near them’ knocked my clarinet into a radiator and now it sounds like a street cat in the rain.” He pulled a crate out from under a table and set it between them. It was full of record sleeves, their corners nearly nibbled off by time. He flipped through them the way people check on sleeping babies. “This is how I learned to breathe,” he said. “From the ones who breathed like this first.”

He told her about recordings made in rooms with no air, about a man with a gold tooth who hit a cowbell like he wanted to wake God, about a woman who sang in Spanish but with Cuban salt in her voice. He told her about how people got paid and didn’t get paid, and how somebody’s nephew once sat in on congas for a whole year and never got his name on the jacket. “I am trying to teach you rhythm but what I am really teaching you is that contracts are devils,” he said, and laughed, and then glanced at the door as if he had said too much.

When he thought she wasn’t looking, he traced his finger along the top of the crate and shivered a little. Money was a ghost that walked into the room and out again.

After class, she walked home with the others, her uniform shirt coming untucked on one side so the breeze could find her. She and Gabo and Marisol took the long way around La Cerámica because the older boys liked to block the street with their bodies and their bikes, their eyes like the restless wings of insects. The older boys called themselves Los Lateros because they collected the stray cans and turned them into something loud. They would kick a can until it had the shape of a memory, then string it up and make it sing. On a good day they would drum on it until the neighborhood knew their names. On a bad day they would drum on a person. The leader was a boy with a shaved head and cheeks smooth as stone. He had a name like a secret: Javier. Everyone called him Javi.

“You see them?” Marisol said, looping her finger in the strap of her bag until it squeaked. “Los Lateros, con su nonsense. Last week they smashed the sign for the doctor’s office then ran behind the panadería. Pa qué.”

“They were bored,” said Gabo. “They got a right to be bored.”

“They have a right to be something else,” said Marisol, who always seemed to have on lip gloss, even when there was no gloss to be had. She was good at shining with nothing.

When the others turned onto their block, Lía kept walking. She liked to keep moving. At the bottom of Calle Humacao she ducked into the alley that cut behind the laundromat and came out by the church. There was a patch of sunlight there that smelled like hot bleach and oranges. She liked to stand in it until the light soaked into her and she felt like a white cloth hung out to dry. That day, the church bells were silent. That day, the alley was not empty.

Javi stepped from behind the soda machine and put a foot down on the end of her shadow. “Where you going,” he said. Not a question. More like a palm pressed to a door.

“Home,” she said.

“No, pero where you going,” he repeated, and this time he smiled so that she could see he was still young and only pretending to be made of stone. He bent and peeled her shadow from the concrete. “It’s too hot to be acting, Lía. You should come to the basketball court. We’re having a game.”

“I don’t play.”

“You could watch,” he said, and now he wasn’t pretending at all. He was mothering hunger. He wanted something from her and he hadn’t decided whether it was a laugh or a fight or a secret. “Or you could sing us the national anthem. Ehh, what do you sing. Something sad.”

“Today I’m walking,” she said, and she took her shadow back with her hand. There are ways to do it. You can kneel and pat it like a dog. You can step sideways until it finds you again. A shadow is just a story the sun is telling about your shape; you can tell other stories. She told her body the story of leaving.

“Fine,” he said, and he stepped out of her way and then back in, like a boy practicing a dance so that when the music came the steps would already be in his bones. “Yo. Lía. Where you going.”

She slipped past while he thought he had her tangled. There are other ways to do it. You can learn to have thin edges. You can learn to be smaller than your outline.

When she got home, the back gate’s latch was broken. Someone had fixed it with a spoon. It made a sound like a sigh when it closed.

The first time it happened it was not magic, not exactly. Within the thick heat of late afternoon, with the rain crawling toward them from the sea, and the ceiling fan holding its breath, and the day peering over the fence to see what kind of night it would become, she stood by the window and pressed her fingers against the screen. The mesh pattern pressed into the soft pads of her fingertips and she held it there because it felt like being written on. Outside, a man dragged a hose across a driveway. A woman argued with someone on a balcony and the plants leaned in. These were the things that always happened. Then something else did.

The light changed around her. Or maybe she changed around the light. The white edges of the window frame lengthened and the street beyond went a shade softer. She felt a pulling inward, like she was being threaded through the eye of a needle she had not known herself to be. The room didn’t tilt. It just went inward with her. Her body forgot about elbows and knees and learned about corners, angles. She forgot about the weight of her braid and her heavy shoes. She remembered air. She took a breath like she’d been underwater. When she turned her head, she had no head. When she looked at her arm, she saw the empty air where it wasn’t. She’d become a story the light couldn’t tell.

There is always a witness. She didn’t know until she came back, until the room spit her out again and she was elbows and knees and shoes and a braid that pulled hair from her scalp. When everything clicked into place, there was a new sound. A small gasp from the bunk above her. Gabo’s kid sister, Sofia, had climbed onto the bottom lid of the window and watched everything through the screen with eyes like pennies in a jar. She dropped back down on the mattress and crawled out. She stood in the middle of the room. She put a fist to the place where a heart is supposed to be. “I saw you,” she said. “You weren’t there. But I saw you.”

“Don’t,” said Lía, and she didn’t know which part of the story she was trying to stop, the observation or the act. “No le digas. Don’t tell.”

Sofia’s face folded into many small planes. “Tell who. Who would I tell.” But her mouth was already on its way to wanting to say things. It wanted to be the first mouth to deliver a story. Sudden power makes a person’s eyes shine. This was not invisibility, but the opposite. The shine said, I could be seen now.

“Tell me later,” said Lía, and she handed the girl the orange from breakfast, the one she had pocketed and forgotten. Bargains should always be made with something sweet.

That night, with the windows open and the street still warm, she tried again. It is not true that light doesn’t care. Light is nosy. It wants to know everything. To let it not know you, you have to be polite. You have to make yourself into a small apology that floats around a room. You have to ask the light to just this once, could it please not say your name. She lay on her back on the floor and watched the fan’s blades shudder and shimmy, then disappear into their own speed, then come back. She practiced small disappearances. To lose the left thumb. To blur the line of the right shoulder. To let a knee get stranger, stranger, gone. She had never been so tired in the mind. She had never felt so awake in her skin.

Morning blew in with both hands. At school, the desks were too close and the chalk squeaked with too much confidence. Everything was too much. She wanted to take the hours one at a time and instead five arrived at her desk and asked her to write her name on them. She couldn’t. Her hand shook. She looked at the alphabet pinned to the wall and didn’t recognize the letters at all.

“You look like you got a fever,” said Marisol, the girl who always had the answer to the first question the teacher asked and the second one too. Sometimes she knew the third and would speak without raising her hand. When the teacher said her name, she would toss back her hair like her name was a dress. “You should go home.”

“I had a dream,” said Lía, and it was the first lie of the day. She learned quickly. “I didn’t sleep.”

“Bend it,” said Marisol, taking her pencil and flipping it upside down, eraser first. “You act like the day is a stick. Bend it.” She leaned in and her lip gloss smelled like guava. She said, sotto voce, “Los Lateros are waiting outside for recess. Javi wants to talk to you.”

“I’m not famous,” said Lía. “There’s no reason anybody should want to talk to me.”

“He likes your hair,” said Marisol. “Everyone likes your hair.”

The music class came like a hush after all the talk. It always did. The instruments sat like polite giants, the ballet of old wood and brass. The room smelled like valve oil and lemon cleaner and chalk dust. There was a poster of Celia on the wall with her arms out like she was lifting the room with her wrists. The poster had been on the wall since before the storm that peeled the paint off the outside of the building and shook out the rats. The storm hadn’t dared touch that wall.

“Today,” said don Jacinto, “we count like fools. We count wrong on purpose, and see what falls out.” He tapped out a rhythm on the edge of the desk and then stopped it with his palm. He looked at their hands and their eyes. When he saw that the curve of attention was not there, he pointed to the window with his chin. “Let them. Let the ones outside count their cans. We have our own.”

He handed Lía a pair of cheap maracas that had been made with plastic so hard it felt like a joke. He called for claps on the threes, on the ones, then on the wrong places, until their bodies learned what their mouths couldn’t say. When she got it right, the small satisfaction was so sweet it made her teeth ache. She laughed once, a burst of compressed air, loud enough to make the boy next to her startle, and she immediately covered her mouth. The laugh had sounded like someone else’s.

“Y esa risa,” said don Jacinto, as if it were a musicians’ secret he’d been waiting for, “is tuned. You should use it.”

At the back of the room, someone slouched with a hat pulled down. The hat was against school rules, but the boy wore it like a crown, which was also against school rules. He lifted the hat with two fingers and cut his eyes at her. Javi. He had a hall pass he had requisitioned from someone else and a debt to pay to someone else and a way of sitting like the chair owed him money. He came because he liked to be in air that was moving. He came because the girls came. He came because sometimes, when he didn’t mean to, his foot tapped along to a beat he wanted to crack open and eat.

When the bell rang, he waited until she pretended not to see him and then he spoke her name into the side of her face. “Lía.”

She didn’t stop. She had already decided that stopping was what people who wanted to be seen did. She didn’t, not now. The hallway smelled like spaghetti and pencils and bodies. She moved through the smell.

“Ehh,” he said, because he didn’t like to have to try again. “Don’t be like that.”

“Like what.”

“Like a window,” he said softly. That was a surprise. He had a mouth for jokes and a body for walls and he had said something that could become a line in a song. She did not look back. She wondered whether he had seen something he wasn’t supposed to see. She wondered whether she had left a smudge in the air where her body had been.

The day stretched, snapped, broke into pieces like a candy bar the kids had to share. At lunch, someone had decided to stage an argument about the neighborhood basketball court and whether it belonged to the boys who always had the ball. A teacher got involved. “It’s city property,” she said, which meant nothing in any language. When people were done arguing, the sky got dark and then it got darker.

“You should go home,” said Gabo. He had rolled up his uniform shirt sleeves to show forearms that wanted to be more than forearms. He kept a notebook in his pocket with words he never showed anyone. He wanted to be a mechanic or a poet. That day he wanted to be someone who could walk her home and not be interrupted by the weather.

“I never live where I go home,” said Lía. It came out wrong and true at once. The rain wash came in so fast that the gum wrappers lifted from the gutter like they had always been leaves. Kids ran willy-nilly and the teachers shouted and the rain laughed and did what it wanted.

They made it halfway to La Casa Azul and then she stopped. She had felt it three steps ago, the looseness in the air. She put her hand on his arm and his arm was solid, boy-warm, and then she let it go. The rain had brought the thin place with it. It went where it wanted and today it had come to her. She took a breath. She saw the house at the end of the block where the woman had always hung laundry and the laundry always smelled like tears. She saw the man with the hose. She saw the graffiti that read NOS VEMOS and she saw it more than she saw anything else. We see each other. She was so tired of being seen in the wrong ways. Let the words reverse. Let them say what she needed them to say. Let them read no te veo. I don’t see you.

“Qué,” said Gabo. He was watching the rain bounce up from the street like the street had a voice. He was saying what have you done with his face, and she hadn’t done anything except take her shape and fold it. You can turn a shirt inside out and it’s still a shirt. You can do the same with a girl. If she is small enough. If she asks the rain to help.

She was gone. The space she had occupied was full of water and air. Her body, which had loved being stubborn, softened. The raindrops didn’t have to break around her. They made lines where she had been and then they made new lines. She could feel Gabo’s presence like a low drum. He reached for her, then stopped, then let his hands drop to his sides. He was not a fool. He would not grab at air when the air was watching.

“Okay,” he said to no one particular. “Okay.” He leaned against the wall and the rain made his hair a crown of needles. He waited, and in the waiting he chose a side. Later, when people asked, he could have said, I saw it. He chose not to. In the story that belonged to him he would be the one who believed quietly. He would be the one who learned how not to comment.

She came back when the rain decided it had made its point. In her mouth was a bitterness like a lime that had been too long in the sun. She coughed and a small thread of something came out of her throat that was not spit. It was light. Or it was the memory of light. It floated for a second and then was gone.

“You’re wet,” said Gabo, which was the incorrect joke and also the perfect one, and she laughed, which made her cough again, which made them both laugh harder until the laughing stood the rain up and sent it away.

When they got to the house, Alma Rosa waited at the top of the stairs like a door breathing. “You,” she said. “Girl. You are never where you’re supposed to be. What is that. Your shirt. You are out of uniform. And your form. You must sign the form.”

“I’m here,” said Lía, and resisted the urge to say no, not quite. To say she had been elsewhere and that the elsewhere was not a place a blue binder could hold. She signed the form. Her hand shook. The pen ran out of ink and she shook it, coaxing it like a snake out of a basket. The signature became a river that got lost in the delta.

That night, in the music room, the air still had the wet edge. Don Jacinto was there when she slipped in, though class was hours gone. He sat with the crate of records in his lap and his eyes like a well that could hold more water. “You shouldn’t be here,” he said, toward the door, toward the rules, toward the version of himself who hadn’t always wanted to be the kind of man who said no.

“Who else is going to talk to the instruments,” she said. She put her fingers on the piano keys and made a chord that sounded like a bridge wanting to stand when the water lifted it.

“Don’t,” he said, not for the sound but for the path he saw unrolling. “You make everything in here grow legs. You make me want things I can’t afford.”

“What do you want,” she said, because she always asked for people to show their wanting. It was the first step toward making it smaller.

“I want to own the room where the sound gets made,” he said, and then he blushed like a boy who had confessed that he wanted someone to touch his hair. “I want to make sure nobody’s nephew gets erased. I want to print names on paper and for them to stay.”

“You’re a teacher,” she said, as if that was the same thing. He shook his head.

“I am a man with a set of keys that belong to the school board and a list of students who will graduate and forget about me,” he said. “Ask me in my other life.”

“You have another life,” she said. “Where is it.”

“In boxes,” he said. He pointed to the crates. “In receipts I didn’t keep. In the sound of a woman’s laugh on a track nobody puts on anymore because it’s got an organ solo that’s too long for the radio. In a studio I go to once a month because the owner owes me and he won’t admit it because he’s my cousin.”

She had not meant to tell him. People said don’t tell adults anything you really want them to understand. They said no adult had hands soft enough to hold a secret without squeezing it. But the night had shifted and she had a weight in her chest that felt like a song that would hurt her if it wasn’t let out. “Sir,” she said, and felt foolish for the sir. “There is something.”

“What, my girl.”

She tried to show him. She didn’t do the whole of it. She did enough. She let her right hand go away and then brought it back. She did it quickly, like a bad trick. She did it on the piano keys so that the absence made no sound and then the return made a chord that said, hello, I remember you.

He did not shout or pretend that nothing had happened. He took off his glasses and cleaned them on his shirt and then put them back on, which did nothing to the phenomenon but gave him time to think slow instead of fast. “Okay,” he said finally. “Okay, no. All right.” He spread his fingers in the air in front of her as if splaying the air would let him see better. “What does it feel like.”

She told him. About the needle’s eye. About asking light to look away. About bending the day.

“You should never do it when you’re angry,” he said, automatically, like a man telling a child never to swim when the flags are red. “The tide will take you somewhere you don’t know.”

“I don’t do it,” she said, and then she caught herself because she did. “Sometimes it does me.”

He laughed once, a sound like a wrench clicking. “You think that’s any different from what the rest of us live,” he said. “An alarm goes off in the morning and it does you. You think you made yourself wake up. The day does you. Love does you. Money. Every story is a net. The question is, can you get your hand free.”

“I thought you would tell me I’m a devil,” she said, half teasing, half serious.

“I tell you you’re a girl who all her life has been told to be smaller,” he said. “And now you know how to be smaller. And it is a danger and a gift. You need to learn when to be large. You need to be in rooms where your bigness doesn’t break anybody’s furniture.”

“Such as?”

He looked around at the cracked window and the grit on the floor and the poster that refused to fade. “Such as here,” he said. “For as long as here can hold. Such as any stage I can find you. Such as any room where there are microphones and the door isn’t locked from the inside. Such as any place where nobody asks you to leave your shadow at the coat check. Such as the inside of your own lungs.”

The door opened then and Alma Rosa stood there with her broom voice and her three questions. “Is she bothering you,” she asked into the room. “Has she stolen anything. Why are the lights on.”

“She is not,” said don Jacinto. “She has not. They are on because people see better in light.” He had become brave in the small space between when a trick was a trick and when it was a tragedy. He felt the line and put his shoe on it.

“I was doing my homework,” said Lía, and she picked up a notebook and made her face into the sort of face that made adults look away. Not because of innocence, but because of its opposite. A face that said I am already having a life when you aren’t looking. You cannot stop it.

“Lights off in five,” said Alma Rosa, because rules are like chairs in a room; they are meant to keep people from sitting on the floor. “You best not run out the back.” She left her broom leaning in the corner as if to remind them she could return.

When the door closed, they exhaled. She touched the piano. “You have to teach me,” she said.

“To what,” he asked, and his eyebrows went up because he was the one supposed to ask that question, not her.

“To be,” she said, and stopped because it sounded embarrassing and too long for her mouth. “To be in a room like this and not make bad things happen. To be in a room with a stage and not vanish.”

“I will,” he said, because sometimes a promise is a door and opening it is the only merciful thing. “But I warn you. The stage is a liar.”

“What do you mean.”

“It tells you you are yourself, and then you believe it, and then the stage moves when you step and you fall into the orchestra pit and someone comes with a dustpan and sweeps you to the side and you become part of the glitter. You are never entirely yourself up there. You need other selves. The one that learns how to count. The one that keeps breath when the clapping fills your ears. The one that knows how to be seen and not be eaten. There is a self for running. There is a self for staying. There is a self for money. There is a self for love. You need them all. And the one that disappears, you ask her to sit quietly when the others are working.”

“I can do that,” she said, quick, too quick, which made both of them look at each other and know that neither of them believed her, not yet.

Outside, a car backfired, then another, and the neighborhood did a quick inventory of gunshots, sighs, backfires, thunder. The call-and-response of a city. The building settled. The night put its hands on them. The poster of Celia watched and said nothing.

Later, when she lay on her bunk and looked at the underside of the slats and the small carvings kids before her had made—hearts with initials, a map of an island, a crude drawing of a dog with ears like knives—she thought about the teacher’s voice when he said other life. She rested a hand on the shoe box full of letters and told it, we will talk later. She told the radio to hush. She told her bones, tomorrow you will stay. She listened to Sofia’s small sleep, which sounded like someone wheeling a suitcase down an uneven sidewalk. She held very still until the stillness made its own kind of music.

In the morning, she woke from a dream she refused to catch by the tail. The dream was full of windows that opened into each other. If you started to pull you would find yourself in the second window, then the third, then in a room you didn’t know where the floor was waxed so clean you could see your face in it and then your face wasn’t there. She got up and put both feet on the tile. She made coffee in the small machine that coughed like an old dog. She took her cup onto the steps and sat among the homeless plants. Somebody had dumped them there at the start of summer, plants they didn’t want anymore. They were not from this island, their leaves too glossy, their stems too confident. They had nonetheless survived, stupid and brave.

“Good morning,” said a voice, and the voice belonged to Javi, who stood beyond the fence with his bike held like a companion. He had taken his helmet off and attached it to the handlebars with the chin strap. The helmet hung there like a crude bowl, a place to collect coins.

“It’s early to be you,” she said. She wrapped her hands around the cup. The coffee had been burned yesterday and was hot today.

“I brought you something,” he said. He held up a little metal thing with wires and a dial, a hand recorder. “Found it. By the court. Maybe belongs to someone, but I cannot say who, exactly. Probably belongs to you, because you have a face like a girl who always wants to catch the sound of something as it is running away.”

He was not wrong about the face. She had the kind of cheekbones that made strangers ask if she was from somewhere else, like the face had walked onto her from a different street. She took the recorder and held it as if it were a fish with a sharp fin. She looked at him not through him. “Why.”

“Because,” he said, and scratched his head as if he could locate the reason there. His head was a clean curve of skin with stubble like a field newly planted. “Because I didn’t want to keep it. Because I am trying to be a man in a world that keeps telling me to be a boy. Because I want to see what you do with it.” He looked away. “Because once a kid gave me a kite and I cut the string the first time I flew it and I think about that too much.”

“You think,” she said, carefully. It was easy to cut a story back down, and she didn’t want to. “That if you give me something, you will be less likely to break it later.”

He laughed and was surprised at himself for laughing. “I think something else,” he said, and changed the subject badly. “There’s a school thing on Friday. The principal is making everyone show their special. You got one.”

“Maybe,” she said. “Maybe I have several. Maybe I collect them. Maybe I keep them in a jar.”

“You should show it,” he said. “Better to show it on a day when people are supposed to say good job than on a day when they don’t know what to say.”

“You don’t know me,” she said, soft, because she had decided that softness made things move.

“I know enough,” he said. “I know your shoes have holes. I know you have a voice like someone who swallowed a radio. You hum when you walk. And now I know you drink coffee too strong for humans.”

“Maybe I’m not,” she said, feeling the edge of her mouth lift. “A human.”

He looked at the way the morning light worked over her shoulders and arms. He looked at the way the fence flickered as the breeze passed. He looked down at his bike, as if the bike would know what to do. “You will do what you want anyway,” he said, a little annoyed, mostly admiring. “I’m just a messenger.”

“From who,” she asked, because if there were others, she wanted their names.

“From me,” he said, and rolled his eyes as if to say, how stupid are you, to want messengers from someone else.

When he left, the coquí noises stumbled down to quiet, as if even the frogs had gone to school. She turned the recorder over in her hands. It had a battery. It was scuffed. It had a strip of tape across the back with a scribble you could not read unless you were the person who had written it. She put it to her mouth and said, “Testing,” and listened to her voice come back a fraction of a second later, small and shiny. She recorded the sound of a truck hitting a pothole and the way the house caught it and changed its shape. She recorded Titi Nena telling a joke about a priest and a bottle of rum. She recorded the elevator crying as it went up and down. She recorded the quiet there was in her when she closed her eyes and counted to three and did not move.

At school, the announcement about Friday was loud enough that a child sleeping in the park would have known. “A showcase,” the principal boomed on the PA. “A day to demonstrate the talents and achievements of our students. We know you are exceptional. Show us.” The word showcase was not his word. It was in a memo sent from someone else.

“Are we animals in a pet store,” said Marisol, flouncing her hair. She never flounced, except when she felt trapped. “Are we going to sit in glass and wait to be adopted.”

“Yo, don’t talk about being adopted,” said a boy who had come to the house once and then not come again. Everyone knew why. The story had been told wrong and then the family had stopped making the hard work of the right story. His eyes were wet. He rubbed them like they had grit. “Don’t joke about it.”

“Perdón,” said Marisol, and she touched his arm with two fingers, like the touch could pull the bristle out of his skin. “I didn’t mean.”

“I know you didn’t,” he said. He stared out the window at nothing. Or at something invisible.

When the bell let them go, she went to the music room in the in-between time before she was supposed to be anywhere else. “I have something,” she said to don Jacinto as if he had asked, and he nodded because he knew to ask later. She showed him the recorder. She didn’t tell him who had given it to her. Adults liked to make judgments about the source when the instrument was what mattered.

“You can teach your voice to be heard through cheap plastic,” he said. “This is the first lie the microphone tells you. You think it’s your friend. You think it will rescue you. It will show you to yourself and you will realize the friend you needed to be is the one toward your own voice.”

She recorded herself laughing in the room and then listened to the way the ceiling caught the high notes and dropped them. She sang the first line of something that wasn’t a song yet and then she was embarrassed because it was like letting a stranger see her in her first hour awake.

“Friday,” he said, tapping the desk lightly. “You will sing.”

“I’ll vanish,” she said, instinctively.

“Don’t,” he said. “Borrow heat from the lights. They won’t ask anything in return. It is people who will ask. And remember, if the lights look too hard at you, look back. You keep forgetting. The look goes both ways.”

Outside the window, the bougainvillea crawled a little, as if it had moved while nobody was watching. It had purple flowers that, if you touched them, threatened to be paper.

On Thursday night, while everyone else twined a nervousness around their wrists like ribbon, while Gabo practiced reading a poem in the mirror with a face that could survive ridicule, while Marisol borrowed a skirt that made the hallway coo when she walked, while the boys measured how high they could jump from the steps without cracking their knees, while the rain held back respectfully for once, while the coquí kept their syllables small and private, she went to the roof. La Casa Azul had a roof you could get to if you knew that one of the windows in the stairwell didn’t latch. The roof had an edge that made you think of toes and edges and how people are always pretending not to want to look down. The city spread itself out like a blanket that had been shaken too hard. There were pigeons on the TV antennas with shoulders like old men.

She stood at the edge and let the wind see her. She spread her arms. She tried to be large. She tried to fill her skin. To occupy herself fully, like a house with all the lights on because the owner had come back after a long time away. Down in the street, Javi’s bike clacked over a loose manhole cover. Down the block, a man practiced the trumpet badly and then the same note right. Laughter rose and fell. The smells were fried things and wet concrete and a perfume that someone had splashed on too generously. It all made a music she would steal if the recorder had had a wider mouth.

She did not vanish. She stood and took up the space that was hers. It was practice. It felt like standing in a doorway and telling yourself, you live here.

“Lía,” someone called gently, and she turned and it was Alma Rosa, her broom voice turned down to sweep a church. “If you fall, I will get fired. That’s not what I’m doing this week.”

“I’m practicing,” said Lía. “Standing up so that tomorrow, when the lights look hard, I don’t flinch.”

“Practice somewhere with railings,” said Alma Rosa, but there was nothing in the words that wanted to tie her feet to the roof. By the door to the stairs, the director leaned and looked at the city like an old lover. “What is your talent.”

“I disappear,” said Lía, surprising both of them, and then she shook her head as if she had tossed off a fly. “I sing. Tal vez. We’ll see.”

“You better sing loud,” said Alma Rosa. “People have gotten so they only hear things that ask to be heard three times.”

“I can do three times,” said Lía, and the wind took her hair and tugged it like a friend. She closed her eyes and counted to three as if the numbers were stepping stones over the flood.

On Friday, the auditorium was a stomach. People went in and it swallowed them and then, later, it would make a noise and spit them back out. The chairs were too red. The curtains were the color of dried blood. The principal wore a tie that looked like a flag for a country that had never existed. Mothers sat in the back and fathers headed for the door and were called back. Kids in line breathed fast. The sound of the microphone tapped, tapped. The act ahead of her caught his foot in an extension cord and fell and got up and everyone did a collective wince that made the air tighten. The act three ahead of her exited a hero. It was not because of the actual thing he did. It was because he had smiled at the right moment.

“You ready,” said Marisol, holding the skirt like a parachute. “I’m going now. After me is the guy with the dog. Be better than the dog.”

“I will be the dog,” she said, a sudden, steady joke and it calmed both of them.

She held the recorder in her pocket. It was off, which felt like a promise and not a disappointment. She had thought about bringing her disappearing with her. She had thought about making the audience gasp in a way that would grab their throats. She had imagined the sound of it, the inhale, the oh. She had imagined the way the story would run after that, barefoot, screaming. Girl vanishes on stage. Orphan or ghost. She decided against it.

Don Jacinto stood in the wings, a music note come alive. He did not say good luck. He did not say break a leg. He said, look back. He said, become large.

When they called her name, it was a name learned from a file. It did not sound like a light step. She took the stage anyway. The light found her and then she found it back. It was strong. She remembered the needle’s eye and she chose not to go. She sang.

She sang like she was making a street out of air and asking people to walk on it. She sang like her lungs had a back door and a front one and they both were open. She sang wrong sometimes and then she turned wrong into a bend you wanted to take. She sang for the way the washing hung on the balcony. She sang for the man who practiced the trumpet and made one note right. She sang for the kid who had left the house and found that leaving is just another room with bad lighting. She sang the first line that wasn’t a song once and became a song when she sang it twice, then again. Three times, as Alma had ordered. You have to tell people what you’re doing. You have to insist. She insisted.

In the second row, a face tightened and then softened. In the back, someone cried a little and tried to hide it. In the wings, don Jacinto bent his head for something that wasn’t prayer and wasn’t breathing and wasn’t pride. It was the moment before a decision is made. The future stood and looked in.

After, she didn’t wait to hear whether they clapped with their hands or with their hearts. She walked off with the calm of someone who has done the correct thing at the correct time and has not broken any furniture. She went to the side door, the one that stuck, and pushed her shoulder into it until it gave. She walked out into the bright heat. The air said, well. The day said, now what.

“Yo,” said Javi, appearing like the answer to a question she hadn’t asked. He balanced the recorder on his palm like an offering. “I taped it. You can have it. If you want to hear what you sound like when your face looks like that.”

“You were inside,” she said. “I didn’t see you.”

“I was the hat,” he said. “My body was attached to it. You’re good. You are very good. The only problem is that now other people know.”

She took the recorder and didn’t say thank you because gratitude changes the color of a thing before you know what the thing is. She wanted to hear herself later, when the day wasn’t looking.

“People will ask,” he said. “They’ll say teach me, let me, give me. They will say, be smaller, so I can fit next to you on the stage. They will say, you can borrow my light if you give me your switch. It has started.”

“It started long ago,” she said, and he nodded, chagrined.

“Right,” he said. “When you were burned into the window screen. When the day wouldn’t let go of you. When the rain decided to play. It started when I saw a girl in an alley who could slip past my foot on her shadow. And I thought, wait.”

“And you thought, mine,” she said, but not mean, just accurate. He nodded again, less chagrined.

“I thought, yes,” he said simply. “And I am trying to unknot that. Don’t look at me like that. I am not a bad boy, only a boy with knots. You can go now. I have said a nice thing and will therefore disappear.” He turned and walked. He did not look back. It is possible to learn not to look back. It’s the hardest lesson and the longest.

Inside, her name was being mispronounced on a list and then pronounced correctly in someone’s mouth. The air was full of claps hitting each other. The coquí made their sound in the middle of the day, which meant the weather had decided to turn. She stood in the bright for a moment and let herself be a girl who had done a thing. She let that version settle into her bones. She did not know what would happen when the next version arrived to turn her inside out again. She. For the moment. Was seen, and had chosen it, and had not died of it. The light lifted its fingers. She lifted hers back.The building woke up the next morning with its joints popping and its railing warmed from all the hands that had slid down it the night before. The claps from the auditorium were still lodged in the corners of people’s mouths; smiles broke at odd times like little hiccups of light. In the kitchen, the fan was back to half-working and Titi Nena cracked eggs with one hand and told three versions of the same story to three different tables because repetition is a kind of love. “I knew it,” she said, and her gold tooth winked at whoever looked up. “From the way that girl stirred coffee. You can tell a singer from how they stir.” She snapped at a boy who tried to pocket a fried plantain. “Leave that for a person with a long day.” The radio on the shelf burbled the morning talk, two hosts doing a soft fight over politics and potholes, and then a caller with a voice that could slide under your skin said, “Did you hear about the girl from the Casa. The one with the name like a step.” The radio cut her off with a commercial for car insurance, and the kitchen groaned, wanting the story to land cleanly somewhere.

Alma Rosa had her keys on a ring that could anchor a boat, and they hit against her thigh like a small orchestra. She intercepted Lía on the landing the way a person intercepts a rolling bottle. “Office,” she said, and held up a piece of paper that had been folded and unfolded so many times it had learned the shape of her hand. “Someone called. Community radio. They want to interview you on Sunday. Who are these people. Do they have chairs that aren’t broken. Do they give water. Are they the ones with the mural of the man with the enormous head.” She didn’t wait for answers because answers never behaved. “You have to sign a permission. Look.” She slid the paper over the desk like a dealer at a table with a fixed game. The line for age was blank. The line for guardian glared.

“Seventeen,” said Alma, without looking up, as if she were laying a fabric over a stain. “Let’s pick one and wear it for the week.”

“Seventeen,” repeated Lía, because sometimes if you said a thing twice it stuck like honey on a spoon. She studied the form, which wanted much more from her than the stage had. The form wanted her address in three versions and a phone number that stayed put. It wanted a parent signature that wasn’t a rumor. It wanted to know if she had allergies to peanuts or applause. She put her name where it asked for it and then paused at the guardian line.

“I can be that,” said Alma briskly, and she signed in a hand that had corrected a thousand misspelled names and lifted a thousand small faces to see if there was snot under the nose. “You look at me like I am doing a crime. I am. A soft crime. For which I am already in jail.” Her mouth made a straight line that didn’t know if it was a smile. “You say no to things, a day comes when the doors get used to closing. You say yes and the doors get bored of themselves.”

At school, the hallway made a sound as soon as she stepped into it. It wasn’t an applause exactly and it wasn’t gossip exactly. It was a shift, like chairs scraping just before people sit. “There she is,” said a boy who had never before noticed she took up space and now stared at her like she might be a new kind of door. “Hey, sing something,” said another, which was the new way to say good morning. Marisol walked beside her with her chin up, which was the way of girls who wanted to catch the light and also reflect it back so that it didn’t own them. “You did it,” she said, and the pride in her voice was a coin she pressed into her friend’s palm. “You were in your own body on a stage with lights and you didn’t throw up. I almost threw up when I watched you. I had to borrow Gabo’s napkin.”

“I don’t own napkins,” said Gabo dryly, adjusting the notebook in his back pocket so that it wouldn’t imprint a poem on his butt. “But I’ll buy one if it’s going to be a matter of public health.” He looked at her and didn’t look, the way he had learned. The not-looking had become a muscle, and it was easier for him than it had been the day before. “You sounded like a street before it rains,” he said softly, repeating the sentence that had been waiting for a home. “If the street decided it loved the people walking on it.”

In the music room, don Jacinto checked the tuning of a guitar with the same tenderness he might have used to check a baby’s fontanel. The poster of Celia had a light mark where someone had tried to trace her outline and stopped, embarrassed at the audacity. He didn’t say felicidades. He handed her a battered folder where he kept, in no discernible order, newspaper clippings about dead musicians, lyrics scribbled on receipts, and the names of drummers who would show up late and be forgiven. “Saturday night,” he said, and the two words were a drumroll. “We will go to a studio. To see the room where sound gets trapped. My cousin is a thief and a saint. He will let us have an hour because I once lied for him to his mother and told her he was with me when he was not with me. We will go when nobody is looking and before he remembers to charge me what he charges the boys who come with chains and small dogs. You should bring your recorder.”

“It eats batteries,” she said, patting her pocket to feel the small weight. “It eats them and then burps plastic.”

“All hunger is holy if you can point it,” he said, and then, catching himself at the doorway of preaching, turned the sentence into a joke. “Except when it is for my empanadas. That hunger is a demon, and I will fight it with my hands.”

That night, after the building had exhausted itself with the sound of faucets and arguments and TV laughter that was too loud, after Sofia had fallen asleep with her head at the wrong end of the bed, her feet on the pillow like a queen who had given up the crown, after the rain had started a slow, respectful drip, she lay on the floor with the recorder on her chest. It ticked because something inside of it was cheap and trying its best. She pressed record and whispered her name and then she breathed in and out until her breath was a tide. She let go of her left wrist first, because wrists offended her with the way they confessed the pulse. Then the slope of a shoulder. Then, for a second only, the absence of her mouth, which made the room taste different. When she played it back, she heard the silence around her name open like a door. There was a gap the size of a question. The machine had not known what to do with the moment where she wasn't about any of the things a microphone loves: friction, breath, click, hum. It had put a smoothness there, a glass. You couldn’t hear it if you didn’t know it was there. She knew.

“You broke it,” whispered Sofia’s voice from the bunk, not unkindly and not entirely awake. “You broke the part that knows people.” She slid down like a small animal coming out of a cave and put her cheeks on the cool tile. “I won’t tell. I will start charging soon, pero for now you get one free.”

“I will give you another orange,” said Lía, who had learned that future generosity, properly promised, could bank against present danger. She twined a piece of hair around her finger and then unwound it. “Don’t try it. Don’t try to be gone. It tickles and then it hurts.”

“Yo, I’ll stick to the regular ways of being invisible,” said the girl, with the practical pride of a child who already knew how to shrink between adults’ sentences. “I can sit on a chair and nobody will see me because I sit right.” She rubbed her eyes with the heels of her hands and added, as if it were a weather report, “There were men outside. The can boy and the others. They were making a rhythm like spoons banging on the sides of a pot. It was good. In a dumb way.”

Saturday afternoon, the basketball court held the heat like a plate left under lamps. The paint had peeled in a pattern that looked like islands. The chain-link fence buzzed with the electricity of hateful words teenagers had thrown at it. Los Lateros had claimed one corner, dragging in their drums made from the redeemed bodies of trash cans and old oil tins and a water heater that had seen the inside of a hurricane and not liked it. Javi sat on the boundary line with one foot inside and one foot out because he was always practicing how to be inside and not owned by the inside. He had a stick in his hand and he tapped it on his knee with a rhythm that made an old woman on a bench nod against her will.

“Sing something over this,” he said as she approached, not to her exactly but to the air, which he had noticed paid attention when she breathed. He signaled with his chin and his boys fell into a pattern that was not a standard anybody taught in school, a seven with a stutter at the end, a clatter that smoothed out just when it should have gotten worse. It was not music that would pass a test. It was music that would hover over a corner for a summer and then vanish, carried only in the knees of the boys who had jumped to it and the memory of a woman’s hips as she carried a bag back from the store.

“I don’t take orders,” she said, because it was better to say it when there wasn’t a fight and practice that muscle too. But she started to hum, because the hum was a private room and she could cut a door into it. She unspooled a line and then another, words without words, the syllables that are used to say hurry and hold and careful and it’s going to be okay even when it isn’t. The recorder sat warm in her pocket and she let it open its small mouth. She would listen later to the way the cans put dents in the air.

“Eso,” said Gabo, who had perched on the fence and pretended to be the kind of boy who didn’t write lines about fences. “You should put a word in it. Just one. Not too many, or the crowd will think you’re bragging.”

“Nos,” she said, and it hung there like laundry. She tasted it. It was small and then it got bigger. “Nos vemos.” She liked how the s hissed and the v made a little bridge from one lip to the other.

“No te veo,” countered Javi, grinning with the wickedness he put on when he remembered he could charm with an alternative. “If they want you, make them reach. Give and take back.” He spun his stick in his hand and caught it with fingers that were quick without having learned any card tricks yet. His ankle bones were scuffed where the chain on his bike had kissed him and left grease.

They made a small song there that belonged to nobody and everybody. The neighbors put it in their cabinets between the plates. A woman with curlers clapped from the window and then looked away in case anyone thought she cared. The boys sweat through their shirts and didn’t smell like boys for a while; they smelled like effort.

Later, when the heat tilted and the long shadow of the church pole tickled the court, when kids started to get sent upstairs by mothers whose voices bent through screens, when one of the older boys said he had to go because his cousin had a situation and he might be needed to be a body, they dismantled the beat and carried it home in pieces. Javi rolled his bike backward so the chain wouldn't slip, walked beside her for half a block, said nothing, and then said too much. “My cousin says there’s a DJ who likes to record street things and then polish them up and put them on records and then get on planes,” he said casually, which is the way you drop a bomb and hope it lands in the shallow water, not the deep. “He pays sometimes. He says he wants a girl. Because girls sell, which is a truth I learned the bad way and the good.”

“Don’t sell me,” she said, because she wanted him to know that her price was in a different currency than the ones he had learned to count. “Not to your cousin, not to anybody who dresses better than me and talks faster.”

“I’m telling you so you can say no,” he said, surprising both of them. “If I learn to do that, I might get to live. That’s what the old men say who still have all their teeth.”

Saturday night, the studio was in a building that had pretended to be a dentist’s office and then a vitamin store and then had gotten tired and decided to be nothing and, because it was Puerto Rico, nothing included a studio with a soundproofed room that had been soundproofed with mattresses and the pages of old phone books. The sign outside said something like Hi-Fi in a font that had used to mean something. Inside, the cousin had a belly that arrived a second before he did and a chain that said he had made friends with the idea of metal. He hugged don Jacinto in a crooked way and then looked at the boy who had brought the cans and at the girl with the stubborn face and the cheap recorder and he did the math everybody does when they think they are the first to set the price of something new.

“An hour,” he said. “Two if your teacher promises me three favors in his next life.”

“You already owe me in this one,” said don Jacinto, moving his hands like he was shooing chickens. “We will be fast. We will leave ghost light. We will not touch your organ.”

“You will not touch my anything,” said the cousin, laughing to formalize the boundary and make it friendly. He tapped the glass of the booth. “Go. Before the electricity decides it is bored.”

The room smelled like electricity itself, hot and suspicious. There were three microphones, one older than everyone present, with a grill that had been kissed by voices that now lived elsewhere. There was a board with sliders and buttons and a ashtray with no ash because even the devils had learned certain courtesies. The boys set up their cans and their pots and their big water heater drum, which sounded like somebody knocking at the bottom of a well. The air gathered itself.

“We aren’t signing anything,” said Lía, more to herself than to anyone else. She held the recorder by its strap and put it on the ledge, pointed at the room, as if she could tell it to learn from a bigger mouth.

“Nah,” said the cousin easily, which meant everything and nothing. He held up a sheet of paper by its corner as if it might be full of nails. “You’ll want credit, though. People like to see their names. Even if I spell it wrong, you’ll show your grandchildren and say, this is how they spelled it when I was young and stupid.”

“The file name,” she said, and gave him the short version, the one that didn’t want to cry. She did not give him what was in the shoe box, the other name that had the inside of a mango to it. He wrote her name; it looked like a road sign when you drive past too fast.

“Count wrong,” murmured don Jacinto through the glass, his mouth close to the mic but his voice traveling to her through the space itself. “Like fools. See what falls out. And when you feel the light stare, stare back. It can’t help it. It was born nosy.”

They started. Javi’s stick hit the rim of a pan and the noise shot around the room and then came back with its hair combed, which was what a studio did for you. The boys built something with their wrists and their calves. She came in late on purpose, which is different from being late by accident. She let the word nos appear like a boat in a fog and then she stuck the rest to it. “Nos vemos,” she sang, and it was a promise and a threat and a shrug. She sang toward the corner where a piece of foam had been pinned with duct tape and a prayer, because it seemed the kind of corner that would keep a secret. She sang while the cheap recorder clicked and took small bites and while the big mic swallowed whole.

Halfway through the second take, the lights hiccuped and the room did that thing rooms do when they flirt with the idea of darkness. In the window between them, the cousin raised his eyebrows as if to say, listen. The boys didn’t stop because boys who had to stop and start their whole lives had learned to keep moving when electricity got bored. She felt the old urge, the needle’s eye, the way she could become a polite apology that slid under the door. She told the urge to stand against the wall and wait its turn. She stared at the light that hung above the music stand, which was nothing but a white throat with a bulb in it, and she dared it to love her back. It did. It flared and steadied and she sang, “No te veo,” just once, in a voice that made the cousin’s hand go still over the board.

After, the room swam with heat and the ghost of what they had made. They stood dumbly happy like people who have danced and forgotten the names of the people they danced with and remember only the shade of their clothes. The cousin took off his headphones with care and put them down as if they contained bees. “There,” he said, in a tone that had exactly one word’s worth of pride and resentment and hunger and inevitable math. “It’s a thing. I will shine it. I will ask favors of the machines. I will make it friendlier to radio. I will—”

“You will make me a copy,” said don Jacinto, with a softness that felt heavy. “Now. Before the future gets ideas.” He slipped cash to the side because you feed a ghost or it rattles the pots. The cousin looked at the money like he didn’t know whether to be offended and then decided not to be. He slid a disc into a tray and pressed a button and the red light showed its tiny, unimportant heart. He handed over one. He kept one. The boys took pictures with cheap phones even though they were still inside the room and nothing was glamorous except for the idea of it.

“You need a name for the track,” said the cousin, bored with the poetry of his own suggestion. “’Nos Vemos’ is fine, pero I already have three of those on my shelf. ‘No Te Vayas’ is taken by five different men with mustaches.”

“It’s called ‘Look Back,’” said Lía, without asking permission from her mouth. “Because the light has to learn too.”

They left into the humid dark, which crowds around you differently when you’ve made a thing. The street had the face of someone who has been told a secret and won’t say but will take it to the grave and polish it there. Javi walked a little apart, his hat on his head even though night doesn’t care about the sun. “You did not disappear,” he said, equal parts disappointed and relieved. He kept his eyes on the road because older boys watched and he liked to practice not caring. “I thought you might. We could have had a story nobody else had. We still do. But I am greedy.”

“You’re not greedy,” she said. “You’re just hungry. Like the machine.” She patted the recorder’s side. It had survived. It had caught them. It had little teeth marks no one would ever see.

Back at the building, Alma Rosa was on the steps with a cup she said was tea and smelled like something with more courage in it. The mail balanced on her knee. “Florida,” she said, tapping one envelope with a fingernail so that it clicked. “Siempre Florida. They think we look up at the same sky and think the same thing. They are not wrong, but I am too tired for that thought tonight.” She handed the envelope to Lía like she was handing her a hot stone. “This one came today. It said ‘Forward requested.’ I send it forward to you.”

She had carried the shoe box around for a year like a person carries an extra organ. She had touched every stamp and had not opened any. The letters’ weight had changed with the weather. They had swelled in the rain and flattened in the heat. They had slept under her bunk and learned her dreams. Sitting on the third step with the night turning its big face to them, with the coquí trying a new cadence just to see if anyone would say anything, with a boy at the corner trying and failing to look like he wasn’t waiting for the older boys, she opened one. The paper inside was thinner than the paper here. It smelled like someone else’s kitchen. It had a pressed flower inside, the color gone from it so it was just shape, and the shape was of a thing that had once been sure it had time.

Mi niña, it said, and then another name, the one that lived under her clothes. It rolled over her like a tide that knew her belly. It was not Aurelia, which would have been too neat. It was Lileana, which tucked into Lía like a seed inside a fruit. The letter talked like a person who had to make three statements before the fear could enter the conversation. It said I am trying, I have a job, I have a room with no roaches because the roaches prefer the neighbor. Then it said, I went to Santo Domingo for three weeks because your Tío called and said there was a thing with papers and I came back and Florida had moved the street. Then, in a sentence that was either a knife or a needle, it said, When I call the office the woman is kind and says you are beautiful and tall and I should not worry, but she will not let me say your other name, the best one, because she says the records do not know it.

She put the paper to her nose to smell the ink. She read the lines that did not say I am sorry and heard the way they said it anyway. There was a phone number written three times, once on the top, once in the middle, once at the bottom, because the writer understood how paper migrates. There was a date. It was near. The letter had lived with her under the bed for months and months. Time had continued. Florida had had sunrises. The coquí had not cared.

She went to the roof because names sound different under the big air. She took the recorder and set it down near the edge. The city lifted and lowered its shoulders. The antennae shook their birds off. A stray firework argued with the dark. She pressed record and read one line, then another, then the part where the letter said I remember the sound of your cry, which made her laugh and then cover her mouth because what a thing to admit. The machine caught all of it, the unevenness, the way a line snagged on a nail. When she played it back, there was a point where her voice went soft and the space did something she recognized, the small glass where a person had not been. She heard it and she was not afraid. It sounded like a mistake on a perfect record, the thing that proves you were in a room and not an idea.

On Sunday, Alma took her to the radio station and the building was a square thing with a mural of a woman with headphones and a crown of hibiscus, and the paint had peeled in a way that made the flowers look like they smiled with their chipped teeth. The lobby had a chair with one leg shorter than the others and a poster for a salsa festival that had happened two Christmases ago and had a corner folded over like the festival was still trying to get back to them. A man with a voice that hummed like the inside of a refrigerator walked them down a hallway lined with photographs of people mid-sentence. “We go live,” he said, as if live were somewhere you could travel to with your body. He showed her the microphone and the way to lean into it and the way to look at the host so that they didn’t step on each other and the way to sip water without the sip sounding like a drowning.

The host was a woman with hair that made its own decisions and nails that told you she took herself seriously. She introduced her with the wrong name, then the right one, then said, “Tell me about the moment. The moment when your body got bigger than your fear.” It was a trick, the right trick, making her tell the story they had already heard so the telling could be hers. She told about the light and about the way voices live in corners and about how the day looks at you the same whether you do a brave thing or a stupid one and you find out later which it was when someone throws a brick or bakes you a cake. She did not say anything about the other thing. The microphone did not deserve that hunger.

They played the recording from the studio and the sound was thinner on the radio and somehow larger, like a person you used to know who shows up at a wedding wearing new shoulders. She heard the boys in the background and she heard herself remind the light that she was looking back. She tried not to cry because the mic loves a cry too much and it will keep it and sell it later when you aren’t looking. The host nodded like a person at a funeral who has found the face of the one person they want to talk to. “Eso,” she said into the air. “I’m talking to a girl named, say it.”

“Lía,” she said, and let the sound of it walk out of the room and down the hallway and out of the building and onto the street and up into the sky where the coquí might hear it if they were awake. She let the sound of it turn and look back at her like a dog that refuses to go inside without one more lap of the yard.

The week became something with hands. She could feel it turning her face toward this thing and that, asking, here, what will you do. People in the building asked for things with their eyes and she learned which to say yes to and which to let pass like birds with mean beaks. Alma brought home a stack of forms that had all the same lines and all the same blank spaces for the truth to hide in and said, “I will be your mother when the paper asks. I will be the broom when the dirt asks. You will be you when the night asks. That is division of labor.” Titi Nena saved her a fried plantain on the back of the stove and barked at anyone who reached. The boys on the corner learned her schedule and then unlearned it. Javi stopped twice by the court to practice not looking at her when she came around the bend and failed both times and laughed into his hand like it was a mask. Gabo wrote something on a piece of cardboard and left it under her pillow like a fairy with ink: The light isn’t the sun. It’s the way we agree to see.

The letter from Florida waited in her pocket all day and felt like a coin she wanted to spend but also like prophecy. In the afternoon she dialed the number and listened to the way the ring sounded on that side, a ring that had learned to walk across carpeted rooms and curl around the edges of air-conditioning, and then a voice answered and she said nothing. She held the phone and let the voice say hello three times because she had promised Alma she would not disappear and already she was down a point. On the fourth hello she made a noise that was less than a word and more than a breath, and the voice said her name, the one under the bed, and then said the shorter one like a prayer. They sat in that space a long time, and the silence was not empty. It was full of every thing that had not been said in three years and all the jokes that would have been told and the small irritations about towels and the way she cracked eggs and the way they had both failed to find the correct bus. “Mija,” the voice said finally, a word that is a map, not a label. “Do you have a way. To come here. Later. When the forms let you. When the island decides to be kind.”

“I have this,” she said, because she could not talk about a bridge she had never seen. She lifted the recorder and let it pick up the sound of the coquí in the afternoon, which means the weather is behaving strangely. She held it to the phone and thought, this is what I can hand you that will not get lost in the mail. This is proof of where I live. The voice on the other end went quiet and then said, very softly, “Ay, that sound. You were born to that sound,” and then some other words not intended for a radio or a stage, and after a while they said goodbye without saying it and she put the phone down and did not feel any smaller, which was a miracle.

On Monday, someone had erased SAN JUAN from the chalkboard and written N O S in big letters that took up half the space. Under it, someone younger had added VEMOS, then a scribbled heart and a badly drawn eye, because children are good at making metaphors into cartoons. The chalk dust lifted into the air and the room breathed it. In the hallway, the principal wore a tie that had decided to live a calmer life. He said, “We are proud of you,” in the way principals have learned to say such things without having to elaborate, and then he said, “There’s a man who called. Says he is a cousin of someone and owns a small label and I should give him your number. I do not keep student numbers. I told him we keep our children inside the building and if he wants to talk to them he can attend a PTA meeting.” He seemed pleased with himself in a way that made his neck flush. “He said he would send an email. I do not trust emails. They send themselves. Things should not send themselves. People should knock at the door.” He walked on, telling this truth to his tie.

In the music room, don Jacinto placed the copy of the track inside the crate of records with a solemnity that made her fingertips tingle. He put it between a Celina y Reutilio sleeve and a Willie Colón. “Trapped,” he said. “For now. Until the electricity gets bored again. We will make another. We will not let paper tell us what is real and what is not. We will make mothers cry, and then they will deny it because that is the law.” He picked up a cowbell and held it like a small child. “Also, this needs to be hit like a person who owes you $50. Not like a person who owes you $500. Carefully. With the hope of getting it back.”

She laughed the laugh he liked, the one he said was in tune. She felt the bigness in her going about its business, not requiring a stage. She put her hand on the piano and didn’t play anything and it was music anyway, the same way you can stand on a street and not move and change what the street means. After classes, she and Marisol sat by the bougainvillea and eavesdropped on the ants carrying a potato chip. “If you leave,” said Marisol, as if they were talking about the weather, which they were. “If you go to Florida, will you send back a pair of jeans that make my butt look like a promise. Will you write me letters on paper that smells like air-conditioning. Will you remember Spanish in quotes.”

“If I leave,” said Lía, and the words felt like a trick, because she had been leaving all her life and had only just learned to arrive. “I will send back sound. It will climb the walls at night and tickle your ears. I will send you a recording of the day saying your name correctly.” She thought for a second and added, because promises are nets, “I might not leave, anyway. I’ve only just learned where to buy onions.”

That evening, the rain did its two-step over the roofs and the coquí stuttered and the light on the landing sputtered and then decided to do its job. In the alley behind the laundromat a dog barked at a shadow that turned out to be a plastic bag doing a convincing impression of a rat. The spoon that fixed the gate sighed when it closed. In the kitchen, the fan finally died and everyone stood in the heat together without complaining because some deaths deserve silence. The radio in the corner played a song that made the grandparents look up from their plates. Someone dropped a glass and it did not break, which is a detail that made the night feel like it was choosing them. Upstairs, she took the shoe box and the letter and the recorder and she lay on the floor because the tile had the memory of the storm when it had held a patch of sun and she wanted to borrow that. She was not invisible. She was here. She counted to three, not to disappear, but to show the day she could do something slow and not get punished. She breathed in and out. The light, nosy as always, peeked at her between the slats of the bunk. She looked back at it like a person at a window who has decided to stay and can still wave.The week leaned forward the way a person leans when they are about to say something they think will change the room. Morning came with its basket of chores and people were kinder in small, sideways ways. Someone had chalked a little bracelet of music notes around the door to the music room and then smudged it half away with a shoulder, which seemed right. People loved a sign until it got in the way. The day after the radio, a man in a shirt that could announce a hurricane all by itself stood outside the front gate with a clipboard and a smile shiny as a new spoon, and Alma Rosa made her mouth polite enough to slice fruit and told him that if he wanted to sell anything he’d have to come back with pastries for the kitchen and gym mats for the small ones and a signature from God. He laughed too loud and left a card that said something like development, which did not say who would get developed and who would stay a seed.

At school, the air tasted like pencil shavings and a little like applause rotting sweet in the corners. In homeroom, Marisol announced that she had decided to expand her skill set and that beginning immediately she would master the xylophone, which made the boys at the back laugh because the word sounded like something you weren’t supposed to say out loud. Gabo raised his hand without raising his hand and said he’d read a poem if anyone asked, and nobody did, which made him both relieved and a little resentful at the world’s timing. Lía kept feeling for the small weight of the recorder in her pocket like a person checks a tooth with their tongue when it has started to remind them of itself. Sometimes she pressed the red button without looking and let it take bites out of the day. It liked the way the janitor’s cart knocked the doorjambs, and the way the cafeteria line breathed, and the way the bougainvillea outside the music room scratched its name on the glass on breezy days and sulked on the still ones.

In third period, an inspector the children recognized by his tie and his discomfort showed up at the back of don Jacinto’s room and leaned against the doorframe like a man bracing for a wave. He had a clipboard too, but his was the kind that wrote people out of things. He frowned when he saw the trumpet with its valve guard taped in place, and he frowned at the poster of Celia as if she might instruct children to disobey gravity. He frowned at the crate of records as if it were a pile of rocks arranged to look like a door. “We are evaluating unused spaces,” he said, somehow without moving his lips. “The board is consolidating. The multipurpose room is underutilized as a music classroom given the numbers.”

“The numbers,” repeated don Jacinto softly, as if introducing them to the class. “Class, today the numbers will perform a series of maneuvers to make themselves appear larger when applied to small rooms and smaller when applied to salaries.” He didn’t look at the inspector when he said it, which made the words less dangerous and more true. “We are using this space. Observe.” He clapped on the three, and the children clapped back, and the bougainvillea clawed the glass like someone wanting in.

After, when the man had left a scuff of shoe on the doorjamb and a feeling in the air like rain that wouldn’t bother to fall, the teacher set a metronome on the piano and wound it as if he were tightening something inside his own body. “They will call this room a luxury,” he said, tapping the wood where a nameless student years ago had carved a heart inside a heart. “But nobody ever calls a gun a luxury. They say it is essential, in case of emergency. We will be an emergency. We will become the kind of sound that rattles windows until someone remembers who paid for the glass.”

Word wrapped around the building the way steam wraps around a pot lid. The multipurpose room had been inspected and found guilty of too much purpose. The board wanted it for testing because tests were easier to count than songs. There were murmurs in the stairwell, a small conspiracy being assembled out of adolescents and their terrifying clarity. Marisol suggested a petition with glitter for respect. Gabo said he’d write something they could chant that wasn’t stupid. Sofia, who had perfected the art of listening in hallways, reported that in the office a woman with too much perfume had said the phrase nonessential services and no one had corrected her.

That night, the building took its own inventory the way old buildings do when change prowls around their feet. The elevator sighed as if considering retirement, then decided it would do one more day. The broken fan in the kitchen developed a new wobble that made people speak louder to make sure their words didn’t fall through the gaps in its rhythm. Titi Nena seasoned the air with garlic and control. She instructed three boys on how to stand in line without making the act into a parade. “You get bored and then you start conducting traffic,” she said, shaking the ladle at them. “Traffic does not want your opinion, my amores.”

Javi came by with his hat at an angle that suggested he had not had to fight anyone for it. He had the look of a boy who had found a cupboard of old glass jars and was slowly writing the names of his days on labels and sticking them to the sides. “They came to the court,” he reported, as if bringing news from a country with a different calendar. “Two men with matching shirts that said ‘Community Partnership.’ They have no rhythm. They smile while they talk about permits. They told us some neighbors had complained and others had congratulated them for being brave enough to call. They want to meet the leader. I told them we are organism. No leader, only stomach.” He seemed proud of this science. He kicked at a pebble and sent it skittering down the step into the street like a mouse let out of a pocket.

“Careful,” said Alma without looking up from a stack of forms, because the pebble had barely missed a woman’s shoe and because she had eyes in the back of her head that could see small wars before they started. “The world doesn’t need help to be stupid. It’s got a head start.” She stamped something that had been held for too long. “If they want to stop your noise, they will make a parade of it first. They love a parade they can say they organized after the fact. If they ask for signatures, bring me the paper. I have a pen that runs out only when lying.”

Later, on the courtyard steps, the boy balanced a drumhead on his knees and tapped it with his fingers, not to play but to find out if it wanted to talk. The drumhead had a scar where someone had tried to patch it with a piece of inner tube. He had a strange, tender expression that made his face look like its own younger cousin. “They heard the radio,” he said without quite saying who they were, which was a mercy. “They will want to put your voice on a table and take it apart and tell each other where it was built. I am supposed to be excited when people who have never been to our court say our court out loud like an exotic fruit. I keep thinking of that kite. How good it felt for one minute, and then the string gone.”

“You’re afraid you will cut it again,” she said, not as a challenge, but as a diagnosis offered in a friendly tone so the patient would sit still for the medicine. “You will cut it sometimes. You will let it go sometimes. The trick is knowing which wind is a liar.”

He nodded like someone agreeing with church when they were outside of it. “There’s a gig,” he said, and the word sounded borrowed. “A man asked if we would bring our cans to a place with lights. He wants authenticity but not too much. He wants the noise to sound like a mother who takes Tylenol and not like a mother who throws the bottle. He will pay.” He watched her face while he said it, to see which muscles moved. “If you come, they will like us better. They will think we are softer. I know it sounds crooked. It is crooked.”

“I am not a sticker,” she said. “You cannot put me on your shirts and come home with me and peel me off later and leave the glue behind.” She thought about the studio and the way the cousin’s eyes had measured the air between her and the microphone as if there were a price for it. She thought about the way the cheap recorder sometimes burped a little at the end of a take as if it had eaten more than it meant to. “Maybe we go. Maybe we do not. Let me think with my lungs.”

Wednesday decided to be dramatic and turned off the lights at noon. The blackout did not arrive with sirens; it arrived with a small click that might have been a grasshopper and then the absence of hum, the way a person notices when a neighbor who snores has died. Fans stuttered to stillness. The principal opened doors and windows with the enthusiasm of a man who has found an old skill, and people discovered each other’s faces without the flattering kindness of fluorescent lighting. The school became a ship in a calm sea, with everyone talking a little too loud as if their voices could be wind.

In the music room, the metronome wound down like a toy soldier with no orders. A drum sounded like a bigger drum because the air had one job now and that job was to carry sound. Someone began tapping a pencil and the pencil got ideas about itself and became a baton. The bougainvillea laid its purple notifications against the glass and listened. Don Jacinto went to the crate and slid out a record by feel alone, his fingers learning names over years until paper felt like a face. “We will practice without machines,” he said, which was funny and not, because they were full of machines inside their chests and behind their eyes and in their hunger. “Listen to your own click. Count like fools. Count to three and then pretend the numbers are shy.”

They sang into the heat because there was nothing else to do. In the low light, where everyone had the same kind of skin and the same kind of ghosts, their voices found each other with less argument. Sofia, who had slipped in on an errand and stayed as if the heat had glued her feet to the floor, put her chin on the edge of a desk and watched Lía like a person who had found themselves in a movie they had not auditioned for. The small girl’s eyes were shiny with the kind of tears that don’t fall because they like it where they are. “You glow,” she said later in the hallway, matter-of-fact. “When the lights are gone. Not like a light bulb. Like the memory of one.” She pinched Lía’s forearm and then pinched her own in the same place, a scientist finding a variable. “It’s not hot. It’s not anything. It’s just there.”

“I do not,” said Lía, automatically, and then she went into the bathroom and left the door open so that the thin window above the stall threw a crooked square onto the wall, and she lifted her shirt to her ribs because a person is always braver when alone with tile, and she looked. Her skin looked like skin, which was a relief because sometimes a body can get tired and surprise you, but there was the smallest emission, the way a page looks when you’ve traced on it too hard and the lines from the other side bleed through. She could imagine how the recorder would hear it as a neatness, a blank where grain should be. She laughed at herself in the mirror with her face a little too close to her face and then pulled the shirt down and let the square of light settle back into its habit.

Blackout evenings have their own rules and everyone remembers them even when the power has been steady for months. The building pulled its chairs into the hallway and the stairwell became a theater where the show was each other. Alma set candles where the flame wouldn’t tip and watched them like she watched boys at the corner, loving them and expecting misbehavior. Titi Nena produced a stack of dominoes that clicked like well-made secrets and slapped them down in a rhythm that dared the dark to pretend it was in charge. The street did a slower version of itself. The sirens, when they came, were embarrassed by how loud they had always been.

On the roof, where the sky becomes a different subject, the stars went about their business. You think stars are magic when you live by the sea and then sometimes they show you they are a clock and a weather report and a rumor about distance. People who hadn’t been up there in months now appeared with a cautionary hand on the rail and a plate in the other hand that had something fried on it and something sweet. The coquí tried a new verse and the dogs negotiated their neighborhoods without benefit of streetlights. Javi lay on his back with his hat under his head so it wouldn’t blow away and told a story about a basketball game played in hurricane light, the kind that comes sideways, where the ball does odd things and the hoop seems farther than it is and nobody keeps score because that kind of math is an insult when the electricity is stomping its foot. He spoke into the dark as if the dark might gossip.

“Tomorrow,” he said, pointing his chin at the shape of the city as if he could point at tomorrow like a store sign, “they want us to go rehearse at the place with lights. They say it will make the real thing smoother. I don’t know if smoothing is what we do. We are an honest bump.” He turned his head toward her where she sat with her back against the low parapet, her knees up like small tents. “Come?”

She thought about it with more than her face. She could say no and it would be understood as a no to more than a room. She could say yes and it would be taken as permission for people she hadn’t met to write her into their brochures. She thought about the music room and the record added to the crate and the inspector with his hunger shaped like order. She thought about contracts and cousins and the way a dollar feels different depending on who sweated on it. “We will go,” she said, and all her selves looked at each other and agreed to behave. “But we will take our own light in a jar, in case theirs asks for our switches.”

In the middle of the night, a sound went through the building like a question. It was not the sound of a woman crying because a man had said something with too many teeth. It was not the sound of a child falling off a chair. It was the sound of something metal being knocked out of place just enough to make trouble. People sat up and held their breath and decided whether to leave their beds. Alma was standing on the landing with her keys in her hand before she was awake enough to remember where her shoes were. On the second floor, the spoon that held the gate had given up and dangled, and the gate swung just enough to gape. Gabo and two other boys were there with their bodies arranged to look casual, which was a shape boys learn early, and behind them on the alley side were four older boys with faces you would not cast for a kindness. The older boys were not Los Lateros. They were the ones who always balanced their nights by taking something that hadn’t been offered.

“Qué pasa,” said Alma, and there is a way to say those two words so they are a cover and a threat and a benediction. She barred the gap with her arm like a crossing guard with a heart too big for this city. “You know the rule. You do not come in here with your intentions. You leave them at the church and do a lap in the basketball court until they come back to you worn out.”

“They hurt Kike,” said one of the younger boys, and it was the sort of report you felt in your knees. “They made him bleed in the mouth. They said the court is theirs after dark. They kicked the heater drum. They want us to give them the rim or they will take it.”

The dark held its breath. In the roof of the night, a car alarm began to object to its fate and then thought better of it. Javi came up the stairs like an apology he did not plan to make. He stood behind Alma, and his voice was lower than usual as if he was speaking from a little farther inside his body. “Leave,” he said to the older boys, without glitter, without snarl. “Find someone else to borrow a name from. This one is stamped.” He tapped the gate with his knuckles, and the sound was fragile and final. The older boys did not move because moving is what people do when they have already decided whether to become worse. One of them raised his chin and showed the white scar that lived there, which he had been given as a badge by a night very much like this one.

It would have been a small, ugly thing if it had remained words, but ugliness likes to grow if you water it. The one with the scar pushed the gate with the palm of his hand, and the metal bit into Alma’s forearm and invented a bruise. The building leaned back as a body. Something in the air unthreaded. It is possible to become small without asking the light to look away and to use that smallness like a knife that cuts only rope. Lía did it without a plan. She was a breath between two words and the space between the bars of the gate and the thin corner of the stairwell that most people forgot, and then she was outside on the alley side with her shoulder against the man with the scar, not to push him but to alter the geometry. Bodies believe what corners tell them. The older boy took a surprised step, not backward but sideways, which kept pride intact and spared everyone the inventory that comes after fists. She put her mouth near his ear and spoke in a voice that was all humidity and no spit. “We see you,” she said. “We have so many eyes you wouldn’t like the math.”

He did not jerk because even boys who aren’t taught art are taught theater, and he understood that an old woman and a girl and a boy with a shaved head had staged something on a staircase for him. He did the clever thing. He smiled like he had never been mad and showed his teeth to prove it. He reached up and tugged his ear as if it had been itching him all along. “Nos vemos,” he said, and this time the words were the peace they are when said right. He spoke to the air more than to any person and then he went, and the others flowed after him the way boys do when one boy suggests a new route.

Back inside, the building let go of the breath it had been holding, and a child who had woken up at the first click and pretended not to be awake cried once into her pillow for the relief of it. Alma looked at her forearm and announced the bruise before it could announce itself. “Tomorrow I will wear a long sleeve and make a story about it and the story will be a better color. That is administrative policy.” She looked at the girl and found her face where it lived. “Don’t do that again without warning me first,” she said, which was her way of saying thank you and also of handing a person a small leash and asking them not to run in traffic.

In the morning, the power remembered itself and came back in a sulk with a flicker that made everyone talk about surges like they were gossiping about an aunt. The refrigerator in the kitchen grumbled and then settled into its regular hum like a saint returning to chores after a miracle. In class, the inspector did not come back, but the rumor did, shedding its skin as it moved so that nobody could tell whether it was getting bigger or smaller. The children decided they would perform a concert in the courtyard on Friday without asking permission, because permission asks to be fed and they had no snacks for it. They would show the use of a room by making a new room outside with their mouths.

On Thursday, the rehearsal was at a place that pretended not to be a bar by serving coffee in mugs and putting a plant near the bathroom. The stage was the kind that had seen shoes it wouldn’t have chosen and had been kind to them anyway. A row of colored lights winked like a mouth that had not brushed its teeth. The man in charge had a clipboard and a T-shirt with the venue’s name in a font that had once been about rebellion and now was about a liquor sponsor. He said words like exposure and community and then began rearranging their bodies on the stage like furniture. He asked the boys to be less, which they did not know how to be. He told Javi to smile more, and the boy smiled with half his mouth and put two teeth away for later. He told Lía to stand closer to the mic and farther from the cans, as if either could claim the air. She did as much as made sense and then stopped halfway because stopping halfway is an art too.

They ran the song and it behaved, which made everyone suspicious. They ran it again and it tripped over a cord and got back up and loved itself for surviving. The cheap recorder took its little bites and kept glitching when she tried to breathe too close to the mic as if it were shy of her breath. A woman from the back bar with a rag on her shoulder and a face that had known every kind of midnight watched and nodded at nothing in particular. “That girl,” she said later to the man with the clipboard, but not in a way that suggested she would do anything about the observation. “She has a sound on her like a wedding ring no one else can see.” The man wrote a note on his paper, which would later look like nonsense, a small ant trail leading nowhere.

After, Javi took his hat off in the bathroom and looked at himself in the mirror and did not look back. He had the expression of a person who is trying to teach their face not to do that thing it does when it wants to be loved. He splashed water on his head because the air in there had learned to be sticky from all the other heads. “We will be fine,” he told his reflection in the tone of a brother making a promise he will keep even if the world makes it expensive. The mirror, being glass and not a poet, offered him the opposite of a prophecy and fogged.

Outside, in the alley behind the venue, a cat was passing a message to another cat and stopped mid-sentence when it saw them. The air smelled like beer and a little like salt from somewhere far away. The man with the clipboard came out and tried to say something that would make him appear part of their organism, and then gave up and talked about load-in times instead because nouns were how he knew he belonged anywhere. “Tomorrow,” he said, tapping the list as if the list were a drum. “Seven. You get twenty minutes. Don’t go over. Don’t be weird about the mic. If you’re going to thank anybody, thank the sponsors.”

“We’ll thank the weather,” said Javi, not smiling. “We’ll thank the cans for surviving the men who kick them. We’ll thank the roof for not collapsing into our soup. We’ll thank the boys who didn’t come back to the court because they got tired of being told to be a kind of hungry. We’ll thank… we’ll do what we do.” He reached up and tapped the bill of his hat against the man’s clipboard, not hard enough to be an insult. The man nodded as if a transaction had been completed and went back inside because that was his habitat.

On the way home, they passed the church, which had taken off its shoes for the night and let its feet cool on the steps. There were candles inside and an old woman in the back with her head bowed and her hand moving beads along a string like a person untying a knot in slow motion. The poster for the community sing-along had been taped to the door and the tape had peeled in the corner so that the paper fluttered like a fish trying to remember water. The graffiti that had read NOS VEMOS had been added to in a childish hand: NO TE VEO, and then someone else had corrected it a little with the fat of their thumb, smearing the chalk into a blur that read VE, which could be a command or a plea. Go. See.

She called Florida at dusk not because dusk was sentimental but because it had gaps. The voice she had already learned to find in the static answered and she said hello before the fourth ring this time, which felt like something given back. They spoke in a language that was not exactly Spanish and not exactly English and was mostly the soft noises people make when they are walking toward hugging and don’t want to hurry and arrive out of breath. The woman on the other end said that she had a job wiping tables and making sure nobody stole napkin dispensers and that people up there liked their air cold and their bread sweet. She said she had a friend with a car who could drive to an airport and that some days the world felt like it had a zipper and she was always on the wrong side. She said, with a laugh that had fought for itself, that if her daughter came she would buy a frying pan with a lid and make the house smell like onion without burning the onion, which was a promise and a little disrespect to the onion. They discussed a date that looked like a word until it didn’t, and then they let it sit on the table like two people staring at an orange and considering its peel.

Friday morning was a carnival of purpose. The courtyard filled with chairs that matched each other in their desire to wobble. The children hung a banner that had been painted by four different committees and managed to look like a thing that had always existed. The principal wandered among them with a face that said he was letting this happen and this letting would count when they added up his life later. The inspector did not appear, which may have been his gift. The sun stood at attention and then realized it did not have to, and softened. The coquí kept their counsel inside the shade under the leaves. The chalkboard by the kitchen had the words SAN JUAN back on it, with a halo of NOS around them like a flock.

Don Jacinto put the cowbell in the hands of the child least likely to abuse it and put the maracas with the girl who would make them sound like rain and placed the conga where it would be guarded like a passport. He looked at the crate of records and then looked at the courtyard and then at the crate again and then shook his head because some worlds should not be asked to meet each other in public. “We count,” he said, and the counting went around the edges of the building and came back as if it had visited cousins on the next block. The first piece was ragged and beautiful and then the second was better. A grandmother who had come to deliver a sandwich stopped to wipe her eyes and then lied to the person next to her and said something had gotten in them, a grain of dust the size of her oldest son. The boys from the court held their sticks like passports. Javi looked at the stage and then looked at the sky and then looked at her, and in his eyes was the kind of question people should ask each other more often and out loud. He seemed like he might ask it, and then the moment went past wearing its hat at a jaunty angle and he had to carry the drum into position and the question became part of his wrist.

When it was her turn she felt the day gather itself like a skirt being lifted just enough to step over a puddle. She felt the small animals that lived in her lungs line up like well-behaved children on a field trip. She stepped up and did not flinch. She borrowed heat from the concrete and steadiness from the bougainvillea, which had decided to approve. She looked back at the light, which in a courtyard is not a thing hung from a ceiling but is a decision the sun makes when it is in a good mood. She sang and it was not the same song as the one in the studio and not the same one as the night with the cans and not the same one as the radio. It was a third cousin. It had the island’s teeth. It had her mother’s breath. It had the boy’s foot tapping in it, and Sofia’s held-in tears, and Alma’s broom leaning somewhere nearby like a chaperone who does not embarrass you in front of your friends.

At the back, the inspector, who had not intended to come and had wandered in like a man who had gotten lost in his own city, paused and held his clipboard in a way that suggested he had forgotten which way was up. The numbers had not prepared him for a courtyard like a lung. He did not clap because it would have changed the shape of something fragile, but he moved his face in a way that could grow into a yes if someone watered it. The principal, seeing him from the corner of his eye, tried to make his tie look like it had always hung like that, and failed, and then decided not to care for a whole minute.

After, when the last cowbell had said its piece and the last child had done a bow too deep for their bones, when the chairs were folding themselves into metal annoyances again, when the sky had decided the heat could turn its volume down two notches, she felt a tug of the world that meant the day had something unscheduled to offer. A woman she did not know stood at the edge of the yard wearing a dress that knew where its knees were and carrying a bag that said nothing about its owner. The woman’s hair was braided back like a decision and her mouth was made for sugar and warning. She saw the girl and the girl saw her and that seeing was a sound the recorder could not have caught if it had been turned on and set at her feet. The woman did not wave. The girl did not run. Between them the air counted to three without being asked. The island held still so it would not be accused later of interrupting.

They met in the shade by the bougainvillea as if they had planned it for weeks and the plant had waited for this one performance of itself. The woman said a name that was not the one on the file and not the one the host had mispronounced and not the one that had been written in a stranger’s tidy hand on a school roster, and the girl felt the sound put its hand on the back of her neck the way a good hand does when a child is crossing a busy street. It was a voice she had already heard through telephone wire and the night’s bright air, but it was closer now and it did not have to fight static or sargassum or men with clipboards. It had come as far as it could across water without her help. It had sat on a plane that smelled like other people’s clothes and eaten a pretzel and worried about paperwork and prayed in a language none of the stewards could scold.

They stood there a little foolish because a reunion loves an audience and will pout if deprived of one, and the only audience was a plant and a principal trying to look casual and a teacher holding his crate like it contained fragile bones. “You are taller,” said the woman finally, which could be said at any reunion and be true, even if no one had grown. “You look like you have ideas.” Her hands were empty, which struck the girl as an enormous accomplishment, to come with nothing but hands and a voice.

“I have a little,” said the girl, and her mouth wanted to say all of them and then chose this instead. “I have a radio that isn’t mine and a recording of a thing that happened and a letter with your hand on it. I have onions to buy.” She moved a fraction, which was all it took to become nearer. The woman moved a fraction, which was all it took to become mother. There was a space where a hug lives that they both saw without using. They were careful people. They did not want to tip anything, not even joy. They would build a staircase to it and climb with both feet the same number of times.

Behind them, the boys began to disassemble the stage of the courtyard. Javi slung the heater drum up on one shoulder and walked it like a man leaving a party with his new friend. He looked over once and then practiced not looking again, because sometimes the kind thing is to leave a space whole. Gabo wrote on the back of a flyer with a pen that barely had ink, the sentence too small and important for anybody’s mouth: We are a room no one can close. Marisol found herself crying and then bullied herself out of it with a laugh and then decided to cry anyway and admired herself for being a person who could hold two behaviors against each other without tearing.

When the woman finally opened her hands, there was no magic in it except the only magic worth learning. She touched the girl’s hair and did not say anything about its weight or its stubbornness. She touched the girl’s arm and did not comment on the way the skin felt different from Florida skin and the way sun had written small things on it that would take years to translate. She let her palm rest on the girl’s cheek and the girl did not flinch like she had as a small one when hands had been a rumor. It was a gesture so simple you could forget it if you didn’t teach yourself to remember. The recorder in the girl’s pocket, stupid and brave, clicked as if trying to learn this new beat, and for once she did not reach for it. She let the moment exist without being put in a jar.

They’d have to decide about Florida later. They’d have to decide about papers and courtyards and the hunger of rooms and the way some days the island wants you and some days it wants to see if you can swim. They would have to tell the truth about money to each other without giving it too much power. They would have to learn where to find the good bread. They would have to teach their mouths to say the names they used in their heads out loud without offending the day. For now, they could stand by a wall of bougainvillea and let their shadows overlap on the cracked concrete and tell the light, look, this is also a way of vanishing, and it does not hurt anyone’s furniture.They sat together for a small while as if the plant had assigned them seats. The woman’s voice knew how to go soft without losing any teeth and the girl’s kept surprising itself with how much it could say without opening many doors. Alma hovered just far enough to pretend she was passing by. She had the look of a person who has watched a thousand reunions from the safety of the top stair and knows when to step in with a glass of water and when to point to the bathroom and say, go fix your face. Nereida—because that was her name, sturdy and round, a name that could carry a bag of beans three floors without complaint—smiled at the director, and the smile had the politics of someone who has spent time talking to ladies behind desks. “Gracias,” she said with the weight of a page about to be stamped. “I called. I wrote. I put my heart into an envelope and I sent it with too much postage. You answered.”

“We answered enough,” said Alma. It was not humility so much as an accounting. “Some things do not want to be answered. Some only want to be witnessed.” She put a hand out in that formal way women do when deciding whether to like each other, and their hands shook once, amused and sober. “We have a room that is in danger of being called unnecessary,” she added, because information is a kind of food and you should offer it while people are still sitting. “Your daughter is one of the necessary parts of that room.”

Nereida’s eyes did a thing that had nothing to do with tears and everything to do with light. “She always was,” she said, and then her mouth tucked the sentence back in like a sheet in a hospital bed to keep pride from showing too much. She talked in quick stitches about Florida, the air that made your bones behave, the old women who wrapped their furniture in plastic like they were saving it for a museum, the way the supermarket smelled like cold and tomatoes at once. She had learned the art of letting a complaint end in a laugh so that it would not become the subject of the evening. When she said the word plane she looked at the girl’s face, not at the sky, and the sky, nosy and needy, had to swallow its questions.

By the time the sun slid under the buildings and made them look like taller thoughts, she had a bed promised her in a room that had once held sheet music and now held spare blankets and a lamp with a shade that had lost its taste for straightness. Sofia came in and tilted her head and asked three questions without moving her mouth—will you take her, will you bring us oranges, are you going to smell like that perfume that reminds me of the hospital—and answered them herself with a nod and a small shrug and a look that said she was on nobody’s side and everyone’s. “I’m the door,” she announced to the plant, because sometimes a person needs to explain themselves to something that doesn’t talk back.

The venue downtown had letters on its sign that had once been bold and were now brave. The street it sat on had decided to be dangerous ten years ago and had gotten tired midway through and settled for interesting. Inside, the floor remembered all the shoes it had carried and tried not to judge. The colored lights were awake and bored. The man with the clipboard lined up acts as if placing plates in a rack, and every plate threatened to start singing. Javi’s boys leaned their bodies around the cans like men around a fire and agreed without words to be the kind of loud that doesn’t ask apology. They had on shirts with nothing written on them on purpose. The woman behind the bar stood with her rag and her quiet and surveyed the room the way a grandmother surveys a crowd of grandchildren in a plaza, counting the bumps and adjusting her expectations.

They put the heater drum on a rug that had been cleaned with the kind of cleaner that insists on itself. The microphones had cables that coiled like sleeping snakes. Nereida found a spot near a pillar where she could see without being seen, an art she had perfected in cafeterias and waiting rooms. Alma took a chair by the exit with a view of the fire extinguisher and the set list, which were both instruments of control. Don Jacinto visited the soundboard like a man visiting a relative who had money and a temper, and he put his hand on a fader and then took it away, because kinship has limits. He leaned over to tell the engineer a joke about a trumpet that thought it was a saint, which translated, in this language of wires and knobs, to, be kind to mistakes; they are where the soul lives.

A DJ with a hat that had its own biography slid through the room tasting it. He had the kind of walk men practice until they no longer know they practice it. He recognized the cousin and nodded with the politeness of thieves. He said he’d heard a street song on the radio that made him think of a girl he used to be in love with before he realized he was in love with himself. He said he was looking for voices with a history you could sell in small servings. When he said small, the word sat on the girl’s tongue like a coin she wanted to spit back. She moved to the edge of the light where the edge felt sharp enough to cut.

The first act thanked the sponsors in a voice that made the word sponsor sound like tia. The second act did not thanks anyone, which was its own kind of thanks. By the time the boy with the dog had played a song where the dog howled on purpose and then refused to howl when called, the room had settled into its own rhythm and stopped trying to be improved by any one person’s intentions. Javi stepped into that rhythm with the easy insolence of someone who has had to keep moving in order not to be chosen for someone else’s idea of a story. He hit the rim of the pan with his stick and the noise ran up the walls like a rumor and came back wearing shoes. The boys laid down the clatter that held together like a prayer made of mismatched words. He didn’t look at her when he should have and did look when he shouldn’t, which meant he was paying attention exactly as much as he could without betraying himself.

She was where she belonged and nowhere at once. The stage was exactly as tricky as don Jacinto had promised and not a liar tonight because she had come with her own lies balanced like teacups. The mic waited. The lights looked like strangers about to become too friendly. She borrowed heat from the colors, which cost nothing. She found the pocket where the cans met the air, where the water heater complained in a key that asked to be forgiven, where Javi’s ankle bones wrote small letters to the floor. She sang a line that was not new and did not pretend to be and let it become something else in the room, because rooms do that if you let them. No te veo, she sang once, not like a threat, and the people who had come to be flattered into thinking they were seeing the inside of something rare felt a chill and didn’t mind.

Halfway through, a white light snapped on from the back of the room because someone remembered to remember to turn it on. It looked at her like a question she had failed on a test in a grade she couldn’t recall. It asked for her shape with a politeness that wasn’t sincere. She felt the small, familiar needle begin its tricky work at the base of her spine. She could go through the eye, smaller than breath, and she could let the room have the only story it really wanted—girl disappears where girls are supposed to be seen. Anger was a door somewhere nearby; she chose not to open it because she had been warned and because she wanted to win at this game of staying. She lifted her chin like someone learning to swim on purpose and made herself as heavy as a name on paper. She stared back at the light until it corrected its posture. She held the note and put all the numbers in it, the one and the three and the missed beat that felt like a favor, and people who had come to count something else counted with her without knowing it.

Down by the soundboard, the engineer frowned at the little screen the way men frown at babies when they aren’t sure the baby likes them. A moment on his board smoothed out into nothing, a perfect block of silence with a polite nose, and then the sound leaped again as if it had been running and had cleared an obstacle. He adjusted a knob and then took his hand off because the thing you do when you don’t understand a blessing is let it pass. He looked at the cousin as if to say, there is a ghost in here, and the cousin looked at him like, do not chase it away, I am trying to close a deal with it.

In the audience, Nereida’s body remembered a baby waking at three a.m. with a cry like a trumpet with a stuck valve. It remembered the exact weight of that body and the sweat at the back of a neck and the way a room feels when you carry a small life through it toward the possibility of soothing. She heard the word no in the song and understood which no it was. She kept still because sometimes love is quieting the part of you that wants to jump on stage and hold a person you used to hold. She put her hand on Alma’s arm and they conferred with their fingers. It ran quick through them—are we keeping her, are we letting her, can we do both—and ended in the kind of agreement women have when paperwork will be required but it can wait until after the dishes.

They finished with a little flourish that wasn’t planned and would be imitated badly by three other groups in the next month. The room did the thing rooms do when the sound has asked something of their walls and gotten an answer. People clapped with their hands and with their faces. The man with the clipboard made a motion toward the mic with an invisible rope attached. Javi looked at him like a boy petting a dog that might bite and thanked nobody. The girl said gracias as if she were pouring water into a glass for herself and then for someone else, and the word did not lose any weight on the way down.

Backstage, which was a hallway with a mop and a poster for a Halloween party five years ago where the band had dressed like vegetables, a man in a shirt with a logo approached with his smile stacked in layers. He had a paper in a plastic sleeve that cracked when he bent it. “We love what you’re doing,” he said, the we a country with immigration issues. “We’d like to put you on a flyer. We’d like to give you a slot. Twenty minutes, once a week. We can do a beverage credit, and of course the exposure.” He had learned how to say exposure without sounding like he knew he was saying it. He looked at the girl as if she must have the pen.

The cousin appeared like a man offering legal counsel with his pinky ring. He said there were other offers, which was true in the way hunger is true. He said the label had space and the studio had availability and the DJ had expressed interest in listening. He said they should move quick because songs spoil the way milk does in heat and the weather had been hot too long. He slid the plastic sleeve like a card on a table where children were playing at poker.

“We don’t sign the first thing a man with a smile hands us,” said Alma from the doorway, her voice a broom but used this time to sweep carefully. “We read in a room with chairs that don’t wobble. We ask three questions. We bring a pen that scratches. We come back when the sun is awake. Or we don’t come back at all.” She put her hand on the paper and did not move it. She smiled like the plastic sleeve was a cousin who had been to jail and had learned how to behave. “We are not difficult. We are power of attorney.” Javi laughed, delighted as if someone had just learned a trick he’d been practicing in his head.

The DJ with the hat made a gesture of harmlessness, palms up, rings catching light. “We’re small,” he said, and that was true in the way ants are small and then one day you notice the hill and your foot sinks. “We want to do right. We like the story. Girl from the Casa with the cans boys. It sings itself.” He tasted the words like a man tasting soup that needs salt and tells the cook to add love instead. He looked at the girl as if she were a golden thread he could pull and the scarf would unspool into a radio show.

She watched the mouths make their shapes and she thought about the cowbell and the rule for hitting it, the fifty-dollar difference between tenderness and debt. She thought about the music room and the inspector and the clipboard and the way a room can become illegal if someone decides to rename what happens there. She thought about the way her body felt not disappearing and how heavy that choice was and how she could carry it if she asked the light to also carry some of it. She said they would meet at the Casa, at a time when boys still smelled like soap, and discuss. She made her mouth firm and her voice kind because that combination is a coin some men have never seen and will drop when handed.

They stepped out into the alley and the night laid its hand on their heads like a benediction from an aunt who knows the good cookies are in the second tin. The building across the way had a painted woman with headphones on it, the paint peeling at the ear as if the music had been too much. A notice was taped to the fence around the basketball court with tape that had confidence it had not earned. The paper had official ink and the word temporary in a font that always lies. It said there would be improvements and safety assessments, which were words that had hurt other people before. The boys gathered to read it even though none of them wanted to be seen reading. The older men from the neighborhood nodded with faces that had long ago learned the shape of fight and the shape of pretend-compromise and the way truth sits in a room and plays with its keys while men argue about budgets.

“They will take the rim,” said a boy the color of an argument, and someone snorted because the rim was already half-taken in the nights it had swung under the weight of boys who had learned to hang and get down without breaking anything important. “They will give us a bench,” said another. “They will write a hashtag, and we will be the letter they get wrong.” Javi traced his finger along the chain link and his hand came away with the feel of metal on it. He grinned with none of his teeth, which is a trick he did when he was more afraid than he wanted to be. “We’ll play on the street,” he said. “We’ll drum on the sign they put up. We’ll use their words as a cowbell.”

Nereida stood at the edge and watched her daughter watch the boys. She did not say the sentence that had jumped up in her throat about how Florida also had signs that told you your fun would be allowed after consultation. She did not tell a story about a park by a freeway where birds came anyway and children colored on the sidewalk and a woman in a uniform asked them to leave because chalk dust got into the storm drains and offended the water. She pulled the girl’s braid gently as if adjusting her radio to better reception, and then she put her hand down and left it where hands go when they have to teach themselves to wait.

In the courtyard of La Casa Azul, chairs were introduced to each other for the morning’s meeting that hadn’t been called yet but would be. Alma opened the drawer where she kept the good pens and counted them like something harder to replace. Don Jacinto moved the metronome to the edge of his desk as if it could be used to measure outrage into something useful. Gabo wrote lines on his cardboard at the kitchen table and crossed them out and wrote new ones and let himself keep two because two is how you plant a song: one to stand, one to lean. Marisol drafted a petition with loops so elegant they might convince a judge to wear lip gloss. Sofia slipped into rooms with silence to see what people said when they forgot the little court reporter was present and took notes in her head because paper can betray you.

The girl sat with her mother on the steps where the homeless plants had been, which now looked a little less homeless because someone had turned their pots so their good sides faced the street. They shared a coffee with too much sugar that made the ants delirious and the tongue bold. They talked without marking topics, letting subjects pull at each other like strings in a pocket. Nereida said she had found a room in Florida with a window that faced a parking lot and the window spoke to her of patience and she had been rude back. She said she worked with a woman who had a tattoo of a baby Jesus with his hands out and a face that said he would not forgive everything, and she liked the woman because a god with boundaries was kinder than the alternative. She said, tentatively and then with bravado, that she could be the woman whose name went on the line for guardian if the form asked right and if the room agreed to let her.

“You left,” said the girl, not like an accusation anymore, just like a door being pointed out in case someone forgot how to go through it. “I left because I was asked by poverty,” said the woman simply, and they both looked down at their hands like hands were the culprits. “I thought sending would be enough. I sent money. I sent stories. I sent the idea that I was coming. I didn’t have the fare for the idea. I had to save the idea up. The island kept moving its beach while I counted. I am late,” she said, and the concession sat between them like a polite napkin.

Alma came to the door with a face that had made up its mind and would now like to be inconvenienced by debate. “They will come at three,” she said. “The ones with the clipboards and the words like consolidate. We will not shout at them the way their mothers did not teach them to handle. We will sing at them until their pens have ink again. You will stand where they can see you and you will not disappear. If you disappear, make sure it is only into their denial.” She pointed to the chalkboard where someone had drawn a metronome with wings. “Count like fools,” she added, because repetition is the alleyway to courage.

Before three, the boy with the shaved head stood at the basketball court with a sign he had made out of a box from the store and wrote his name small at the bottom like a man learning how to put a name on a thing without breaking it. He wrote: THE COURT IS A ROOM. He drew a rim in a way that made it look like a halo and a target and a mouth. A woman from the block brought pails and a mop and began washing the paint lines into new brightness, a ceremony that informs walls you will defend them. The older boys who had knocked on the gate the other night stood across the street and watched with a mixture of agitation and respect, which is a blend that often precedes wisdom or further mischief. They argued quietly over whether to attend the meeting and decided to leave their faces on the corner so their bodies could fit somewhere else.

At three, the inspectors came with their pens sharpened as if for surgery. They had the eyes of men who have had to pretend to be bad at dancing at office parties. They held their clipboards in front of their hearts. They stood in the courtyard and tried to be taller than the bougainvillea. They began to say their sentences and the sentences sounded like they had rehearsed in mirrors. They did not realize that the posters on the wall listened and that the instruments, even with their mouths shut, had opinions. The principal wore his tie like a uniform and decided, at the last minute, to be brave without permission.

They sang. It was not a performance. It was proof. They sang a version of “Look Back” that had remembered it had a grandmother who prayed over pots and added a verse for the spoon that had fixed the gate. They put in the line that made the records smooth out for a second and watched the inspectors’ heads tilt like dogs’ mouths. The boys tapped on the benches and the girls clapped on the wrong beat and then the right one and then the better wrong one. The metronome sat on the edge of the piano and kept time with its little heart, and the posters on the wall made their colors a little louder.

The inspectors wrote something on their clipboards that could be read later as approval or as a hint. One of them looked at the music room door and then looked at the courtyard and then looked at the kids and did the quick math of his wage and his dignity and the weather and forgot to frown. The other cleared his throat and said words about safety and resource allocation and the necessity of testing spaces. He said they had to make a balance, and the word balance dropped to the tiles and rolled under a chair. Alma leaned to pick it up and kept it. “We will use it,” she said, later, when they were gone. “We will balance our mouths against their hands. We will see which is heavier.”

After, when the chairs had sighed and the pens had sweated and the sun had decided to be kind for just an inch of sky, the DJ with the hat leaned in the doorway like a promise and held up a phone in a hand that suggested favors owed. “They played your track on a pirate station in Bayamón,” he said, and the word pirate put a glint in Javi’s eye that reminded him of old stories about men with knives and codes. “Someone recorded it and sent it to someone and now someone else wants to talk. That’s three someones. Careful. That’s enough to make a net.”

“Net is better than a hole,” said Marisol, and then, because she suspected what nets do to girls who have learned to be too light, she added, “If we hold the rope.” Nereida nodded like a mother who had seen nets with knots and nets with no mercy. She folded the letter in her pocket one more time until it knew the shape of the day. She looked at her daughter and the courtyard and the music room and the men who had come to measure and had left with their numbers damp. “We will decide soon,” she promised to no one and everyone. “Planes go both directions.”

That night, the building did not sleep so much as hum. The spoon on the gate rested from its heroism. The radio in the kitchen played something that reminded old people of hair grease and young people of TikTok, which is to say the song did its job of being a bridge. The recorder took up space on the nightstand like a small animal that had chosen to live and needed feeding. Lía lay on the floor beside the bed, her back against the cool, and held it to her chest and pressed record and asked into the room, not to be invisible but to be the shape that had learned how to hold herself. She told the light to come sit, to stop being so nosy, to be a friend that listens without interrupting. The light, being itself, tried, and failed, and tried again.

She dreamed differently. The windows did not open into other windows this time but into rooms where people were counting and someone laughed at the wrong place and the laugh turned the count into a dance. She walked from one room to another without losing her own weight. The windows did not blink. The rooms did not ask her to be a different size. In the last room there was a stage with no edge, and the posters of Celia and a cowbell that had learned how to be gentle, and a boy tapping his foot like a metronome with a scar, and a woman whose voice had traveled too far and was now home and refused to be shy about it. They stood together and did nothing. The room did the rest. The light did its nosy best and, for once, did not get in the way.Chapter 9

The morning slipped into the house like a polite cousin with a basket of guavas, and everybody pretended they hadn’t all been awake since before the birds remembered their names. The kitchen wore its old heat with pride and the stove coughed twice before agreeing to be helpful. Nereida cracked eggs into a pan with the authority of someone who had paid rent in three cities and decided this one owed her a good yolk, and Lía stood beside her with the little recorder on the counter catching the small violence of shells meeting the rim of a bowl. The oil told a joke in the pan and the joke had to do with saints who hide in cabinets during blackouts and come out only when garlic hits. On the table, where the cheap napkin had been folded to look like it meant something, a letter lay under the weight of a salt shaker, because paper likes to lift when people talk about leaving. “I have until Tuesday,” said Nereida, not looking at the paper, because dates grow teeth when you look at them too directly. “The woman with the baby Jesus tattoo will cover my shift Sunday if I bring her pasteles at Christmas. Monday, I can wrangle. Tuesday they say the schedule is made of cement. And cement,” she added with a laugh that clipped the end off of fear, “sweats when you ask it to be human.”

“You could stay,” said Alma, breezing in with her keys like a brass choir and a face already ready for a fight. She poured coffee without asking if anyone wanted it and the coffee accepted the invitation without spilling itself, which is a magic the kitchen had learned over time. “Stay the extra days. Tell them the plane had a thought and decided to think it again tomorrow. Tell them Florida will still be there when you are done being a person here. Planes go both ways, mija,” she said to both of them, which was a grandmother’s way of lobbing the same fruit to two hands at once. “Air looks the same wherever it is being cut by a wing.”

“My boss counts heads like coconuts,” said Nereida, but softly, as if not to disturb a plan forming on the stove. “She will miss mine and say the soup tastes thin, and she will not be wrong. Here, at least we have a bowl with a name. There, the bowls hide under plastic and pretend they are not bowls. If I stay and lose it, then who will send the envelope that smells like the inside of a purse. Who will make sure the phone is paid so the call can ring all the way here. I will not lose it,” she said with a stubbornness that was a cousin to love. “But I will stay the extra two days. Talk me into one more, someone. Lie to me nicely.”

“Four,” said Titi Nena, arriving like the end of a card game, hip first, voice bright. “A woman can carve four days out of a man’s calendar. Even if the man is a boss in a polo shirt. Even if the man is a miracle who thinks he manages miracles.” She stole back the salt shaker, salted a tomato with wicked joy, and put the shaker back on the letter like a signature. “Eat. Talking goes better when your mouth has already done the first job.”

By afternoon, the Casa had set itself in its formal clothes for company. The door had a chalk sign that said no sales, only meetings, which had already redirected three men with clipboards back to their cars. The table in the office had been cleared of everything that looked like a distraction and left with three things: a stack of sharp pencils, a pitcher of water sweating like a hardworking liar, and a plate of crackers that appeared plain but were absorbing the politics of the room with each minute. The DJ came without his hat as if he were visiting a church, and the cousin arrived with a shirt that said nothing so as to appear harmless, and a woman from the “label” whose eyes were kind in the way of people who have learned to be kind to small animals while also carrying a scale in their heads. They sat on the chairs that had learned to wobble only when the unwobbling of truth would be too dramatic.

“Tell us what you want,” said Alma, and smiled in the precise way people do when they want it known their patience has an expiration date. “With small words. We have a child here, which is to say a person without time for bullshit.”

“We want to help amplify a thing that already exists,” said the woman from the label, and she made a shape with her hands like she had held sound before and remembered not to squeeze. “We want to put a frame we own around it. We want to press these songs onto plastic and into air and then into other rooms, and we want our names on the bottom of the poster in letters not too large, because we are respectful. We want a modest split,” she said, which was modest in exactly one way. “We want to lock down a first-refusal clause because when something is first it will be before something else, which is a dumb sentence and true.”

“What do you want with the masters,” asked don Jacinto, because watching a man learn to say the word master with the correct worry was one of the joys of middle age. “Who gets to sit on them at night so they do not catch cold. Who decides when they go to Florida to visit their aunt.”

“We hold them,” said the cousin, too fast and then slower, like a person realizing he had accidentally used his inside voice. “We hold them so they don’t get hurt by the world, and also, the world is a liar. We will not be the worst liars you meet.”

“I want to own the room where the sound gets made,” said the teacher, and his voice cracked on the old longing and then smoothed itself out because it had learned public speaking in a city hall once and been asked to leave. “I want her to own the room. If your frame does not wall off the door, then we can hang it and admire it. If your frame comes with a lock, we’ll build a window next to it.”

“We can do a single,” said the woman, who had been doing math the whole time and now put the math on the table like a hand of cards. “One release. Digital rights revert in a year unless renegotiated. No exclusivity on future compositions. We co-own the recording for the period and you hold the raw sessions. We will not claim your live performances. If it grows, we will talk. We pay for radio promotion out of our cut, and we do not charge you for the pleasure of being told what to do. You keep creative control,” she added, and then caught herself before promising anything about edits because the engineer in her ear tugged her sleeve at just the right time.

“Call it a lease,” said Alma, who could turn a metaphor into a contract with a pen and a glare. “You can live in the house of the song for a season. You will not paint the walls without asking. You will not take the windows when you leave. You will write the names on the mailbox with both last names so the neighbors will wave.”

“And your share, Javi,” said the cousin, turning toward the boy because he had learned to spot the hinge of a room. “Los Lateros get points. If your rhythm does the heavy lifting, it should be paid like a back when the bed is too large. You all have names. We will write them.”

Javi looked around like someone who had just learned to dance and didn’t trust the floor. He scratched the back of his neck and looked at the woman without looking as if to see if women changed the math. “We’ll need a lesson,” he said. “In not being stupid. We’ve been paid in T-shirts and in pizza and in mentions on flyers. I want to be paid in receipts. I want to see something with a number that can pay for a sore ankle and a ball for the kids next summer.”

“They pay for the court,” said Gabo from the doorway, and his voice did not apologize for being there without invitation. “If the city is going to put a padlock on where our knees learned their letters, then all this plastic talk is a bowl with a hole. You want to help? Pay for a rim and for paint. Pay for a lawyer who knows the word injunction in two languages. Pay to get a chair for the inspector who can’t stand long because his pride is heavy.”

The woman from the label, to her credit, did not pretend she had arrived with a bucket big enough for this fire. “We can give some money that doesn’t have to be paid back for the court,” she said quietly, as if money behaves better when not shouted. “It is not a river. It is a hose. But a hose can be aimed.” She held out her palms as if offering a cat.

“Then we do a single,” said Alma, writing on the paper because sometimes writing is how a yes finds its spine. “One. We put the names. We keep the room. We let the song go to Florida for a visit if it promises to send a postcard. You bring the legal paper in human size, and we will read it where the light is rude. We will add a line about the court and a line about the music room. We will add a line that says if you use the word exposure you owe us three cases of bottled water and two box fans.”

They laughed because the joke wore truth like a dress. The cousin exhaled like a radiator losing anger. The DJ, who had been performing harmlessness like a magic trick, allowed his hat to appear in his hands and turned the brim with a real smile. “I will call the pirate,” he said. “He is allergic to paper and loves a cause. He will play the single in the dark where the bigger stations get shy. We will make a little noise that feels like home. We will not promise airplanes. Airplanes promise themselves.”

The paper had lines and those lines got filled, and for once names went where they were supposed to without anyone having to pretend to be someone else’s cousin. Nereida took the pen when the line for guardian looked at her like an old friend and wrote the name her mother had chosen and then the name she had gotten when the bus was missed and a hospital worker wrote it the way he liked the letter e. She did not shake. She put her hand on her daughter’s shoulder while the last page got stapled and the staple made the small, satisfying sound that makes even saints blush.

That evening, the court belonged to nobody official. The sassafras of a dozen radios spilled into the air and then got shy when real people showed up. Los Lateros had dragged out their patched drums, and someone had brought a portable light strung from a clothesline, and a woman from two blocks over had set up a folding table with limbers that would melt if you looked at them too hard. The sign that had said improvements had been removed by forces unknown and now existed only in the imaginations of the men who had printed it. On the wall, the NOS VEMOS had developed a cousin: NOS OÍMOS, which was either a demand or an announcement or both. Children wove under the adults’ legs like fish, and the older boys posted up at the corners with exaggerated seriousness so they wouldn’t be accused of feeling anything. The rim looked like it had risen two inches overnight because the day had decided to be brave.

They did not call it a protest because protests make some people polite and others loud, and what they wanted was neither. They called it practice and then, because they wanted the inspector to know it was serious, they called it a lesson. The music room migrated outside like a patient animal and found a new crate to sit on. Don Jacinto balanced his metronome on the back of a bench and it kept time even in a breeze as if it had decided to earn its place among weather. Alma set a chair by the exit because exits comfort her, and she put another chair near the drum because the drum needed a companion. The DJ stood back with his phone in his hand like a mirror he refused to look in.

They played and sang and made clatter like rain rehearsing, and the court held them and did not complain. A police car idled at the end of the block for just long enough to make everyone check their faces and then rolled away, perhaps because the driver had a grandmother who wished he played the bongó. Someone had brought a cousin from a newspaper that had forgotten how to pay writers and the cousin took notes anyway, out of muscle memory or love. The older boys who had pushed at the gate two nights ago came and leaned and listened and learned the chorus just to prove they could and then found themselves singing it on purpose and had to go smoke to convince their bodies they were still the bosses they liked to think they were.

When the moon pulled itself up by its elbow on the edge of the roof, Nereida took her daughter to the water. It was the kind of night when the sea breathes politely at first so you’ll get near, and then shows you its back just once to keep you humble. The sand had the footprints of people whose arguments had worn sandals, and a stray dog limped like a veteran toward a patch of moon and sighed. The air tasted like tin and sugar. They took their shoes off and stood where the waves licked without biting. “Ay,” said Nereida, making a sound her own mother had made when ice fell from a tray and cracked in a glass. “This one you cannot take with you in a jar. This is the one that does all the taking.”

“It wants me,” said the girl, and the honesty was a coin given without the fear of poverty. “It wants to put its fingers through me and see if I can be made of just edges. It wants to teach me to be no one and everyone, which would be easier. I want to be easier, sometimes. I want to slip and not be asked for a name at any door.”

“You will not go without your ankles,” said the woman, which was her own unpoetic rule against self-harm. “The ocean is a mother with many moods. She will cradle you and she will laugh at your hair and she will pull you by your belt if she thinks you are lying about where you came from. And the light on her is a gossip,” she added, and the sea loved her for that and lapped more neatly for a second. “Ask the light to mind its business. Stand in the water and own your bones.”

The girl stepped in up to her shins, and the water read her calves like braille. She thought of the thread she had coughed up after a rain and the way the machines put glass where she had been. She thought of the needle’s eye and the way smaller is a spell that keeps girls safe until it doesn’t. She did not take the invitation to vanish. She spread her arms like a lighthouse remembering its job and let the wave break against her as if she were a rock that had to be respected not because it was large but because it had practice. The recorder sat high on the dry sand and caught the conversation between water and girl and mother and moon, and later it would play back only two of the four because some sounds belong to the inside of the body.

They walked back with their pants wet and their hearts unrusted. On the boardwalk, a man sold piraguas with syrup that promised colors it could not legally deliver, and he drew a star on the paper cone with red like a favor. “Para la cantante,” he said, and then, to the mother with a bow that had been practiced on saints and women at immigration, “Para la que la parió.” He poured a little extra on top and the sugar ran down and made their fingers cousins, and they licked it off without apology.

Two days later, the necessary rooms festival had a name nobody had rehearsed but everyone pronounced correctly. The boys painted a banner that said HABITABLE in thick letters that already smelled like the end of the day. The inspector came in a linen shirt and a face he had taught not to frown in public, and he sat in the front row because his wife had made him promise at breakfast, and promises made over eggs are harder to break. A woman from the council stood at a microphone and said words that had been put into her mouth by a man who thought you could measure courage in square feet. She said “stakeholders” and “accountability” and meant “don’t make me be the villain.” Alma introduced herself as the person responsible if anybody tripped, which was her way of reminding them that the floor had a mother.

They started with “Look Back,” because beginnings get nervous if you leave them alone too long. The courtyard hummed with the light’s nosy interest and the metronome’s small bravery, and the boys found the pocket and then put it on like a shirt. When the smooth rectangle of silence came, when the tape or the air or the light did its polite trick of pretending nothing had happened to a body that had learned to not be a door for a second, the inspector’s pen stuttered and then drew a straight line through a sentence he had planned to use later. He did not know why he did it. His hand knew. He looked at the woman beside him and saw that she was crying in the manner of officials—out of one eye and without capital letters—and he put his clipboard down not because the rules asked him to but because the rules had gotten smaller when the chorus came back.

After, while people milled in the way they do when the end has been postponed by cakes and cousins and a raffle with a toaster, the man from the label slipped in a handwritten envelope to Alma with “for the rim” on the front and an amount inside that made the older boys put their tongues behind their teeth when they heard it. The cousin avoided winks and left quietly, which is an advanced move. The DJ took video of an old man dancing with a cane that had been painted by a granddaughter and posted it before he left the building, because sometimes you need to give the city back to itself in a format it recognizes. Don Jacinto looked at the music room like a husband returning to apologize for having even considered moving to a smaller apartment, and Gabo leaned against the wall and read his poem to nothing in particular, which is the bravest way to do it.

A day later, a coil of trouble unwound itself at the court like a garden hose someone had forgotten to turn off. Two men not from the block with the kind of shoes that make sidewalks suspicious arrived in a truck with a sticker that said “Facilities” and a face that said “Mandate.” They unloaded a box with a triangle symbol, and the box contained a lock with a pamphlet that had a photograph of a smiling padlock wearing sunglasses on the cover. They had the key and the authority and the timing of men who have done this before and only sometimes gotten yelled at. Javi stood with his hands not in fists at his sides because he had rehearsed this posture and wanted to see if it would hold. “Temporary,” said one, reading his instruction in the cautious tone of a man speaking to roosters. “Safety,” said the other, and considered himself done with compassion for the day.

“Temporary is a liar,” said Titi Nena from her stool, appearing like a saint of appropriate profanity. “It is a travel pillow. You think it will help and then you arrive and your neck is wrong. Take your sign and your sunglasses lock and put them on your own door.” She lifted her chin like a blade from a drawer. “We are busy.”

A tightness took hold of the air and threatened to pull faces into their worst habits. The older boys who loved an edge came close enough to loan their edge to the scene. The man with the mandating shoes lifted the lock like a talisman and the room—the court is a room, they had said—considered for one long breatheable second whether it wanted to become a fight. In that second, which is a kind of magic if you catch it, the girl felt her body gather itself to become thin, to cut between men and metal and disappear where consequences might land. She felt the needle’s eye and the tide’s pull and her mother’s hand on her shoulder and the teacher’s warning about angry doors. She did not go. She stepped forward plain as an orange and put her palm on the pole, not to block, not to martyr, but to own a slice of air. “We are playing,” she said in a voice not intended for microphones. “You put that up and you are saying we are not. Decide that out loud. Use the word not. See if it fits in your mouth.”

One of the men made the shape of a smile without letting it near his eyes, which was the language of compliance taught in trainings. The other looked at the boys and learned their names without asking and correctly guessed who had a cousin with a license and a truck. He placed the lock on the pole with the gentleness of a man putting a collar on a stray that has earned the right to not bite him. “We will come back,” he said, and meant it two ways. He handed the key to Alma, and the key was shaped like every other key and exactly like a temporary kingdom. “You hold it. You decide. My boss will make a face. I will tell him there was a parade.” He didn’t look at the DJ filming. He didn’t look at the newspaper cousin pretending he was not writing. He looked at his shoes and decided to change the laces that night.

The paper came the next day with a photo that made the court look like a country, the rim a moon, the girl a tall voice, the boy a posture. The caption did not get anyone’s name right and the article called the songs “chanty raps,” which made Gabo laugh into his notebook until he wrote a better word and mailed it to the editor, who would make a face and then keep it, because that’s what editors do with good words. The inspector cut the article out and put it in a drawer where he kept things that helped him remember when to be a person instead of a pen. The cousin texted at three a.m. to say a man in Bayamón had sampled the smooth in the song and turned it into a kick and it was working, which is to say people were dancing with their mouths open.

They decided in the kitchen, because kitchens are better than offices, to make their own paper. Not to reject the cousin’s frame or the DJ’s hat or the label’s hose, but to create a room inside a record that belonged to people who could walk to it. Don Jacinto brought down a dusty reel-to-reel from the top of a closet that had been keeping secrets for a decade, and the machine made a sound like a man coughing after a long sleep and then agreed to work if someone promised not to rush it. Gabo carved a stamp out of a potato with a paring knife that had known only onions, NOS VEMOS RECORDS in letters that looked like a doorframe built by cousins, and the ink bled in a way that made the paper look like it had been to a party. They recorded a courtyard session on a Sunday afternoon when the light behaved itself and the coquí tried a daytime verse just to be rude. People clapped between takes and the claps took the place of tambourines when none had been issued.

They printed a hundred covers with the potato stamp and glued them with a paste that would not survive a hurricane and counted like fools, and the counting felt like religion until someone yelled that the rice was burning. Nereida copied down a name and an address by hand for each envelope that needed to cross water, which slowed everything down in the good way. Alma wrote a list of who got one for free and who had to put a folded bill in the jar and who had to promise to do a job for it. Sofia acted as bouncer and decided children under seven could only touch the covers with clean hands, which caused three children to cry and then be handed rags and learn the pleasure of being trusted. Javi pressed one of the freshly inked covers against his shirt by accident and left the logo reversed on his chest, and all day people looked at him like he had pledged allegiance to a country he had just made up, which is a lovely way to walk through a day.

At night, the radio slid the track in between news of a protest where nobody had remembered to bring water and an advertisement for a lawyer who had made peace with the word accident. The song smoothed and kicked where it should and held its breath where it shouldn’t, and people who had not met the girls and the boys and the men and the teacher and the woman with the broom arranged themselves in their kitchens and found that their feet were stepping where the room asked them to. The pirate station played it twice by mistake, which is to say on purpose, and a man in a car on the bridge slapped the roof of his own car when the smooth came because he recognized the magic of a body saying no without argument and loved it.

The day before Nereida had to choose a plane, they went to buy onions. It felt like a joke that had grown legs and become a ritual. The woman at the stall wore lipstick that survived earthquakes and asked no questions and weighed the onions as if weighing hearts. “You want the ones that cut you,” she said, and pulled the small mean ones toward them. “Or the ones that forgive. I have both. Today is a good day for forgiving, pero sometimes the cut is what clears the nuisance.” They bought both and put them in the bag and laughed because a life can be this: onions and a record and a court held by a key in a woman’s pocket.

That night, nobody slept all the way through. The house breathed in shifts, and the building asked each person twice if they were sure. The letter on the table had been transferred to under a magnet on the fridge that used to be a gift from a politician and was now only a magnet, which is the best fate for some politicians. The recorder sat on the windowsill like a cricket and clicked once in sympathy when the light out in the street stuttered and then decided to hold. Lía lay with her braid under her neck like a rope she could pull if she needed to stay anchored and counted to three, not to disappear, not to show the day she could, but to make the day wait with her and not go on ahead. In the bed above, Sofia dream-kicked once and then murmured apology to an invisible cat and smiled.

Morning came in with a wind that had found a new route around the building and made notes with the plastic flags on the fence that sounded like someone practicing scales. Nereida packed a bag with the kind of care people use when leaving a place where the air has learned their name, and then she unpacked it and took out the shirt that said a thing too loud and put in the one that could pass in Florida. She placed the envelope with the single and the potato-stamped cover on top of the clothes with both hands as if placing a soft animal into a crate. She left the recorder by the girl’s pillow as if returning a borrowed book with a story she wanted to hear the ending of when she came back.

At the terminal, which is a word that deserves a kinder synonym, they hugged like people who had been taught by two different cities how to hug and still managed to make it mean the same thing. Nereida held the girl’s face and said the private name and the public one and the name under the bed and braided them with her voice like a woman training a rope. “No promises,” she said, while promising ten things with her eyes. “We will do the possible and then ask the impossible to learn our name. You stay big. If you go small, do it because you are practicing for a magician’s trick that will make old men cry when it works, not because you are teaching the day how to misplace you.”

“I’ll bring you a jar of light,” said the girl into her shoulder, because the joke had become a truth. “You bring me plastic forks from the cafeteria. Not the ones that break. The ones that think they are knives. We’ll trade.”

They parted with the awkwardness of people who have, for once, said enough. The plane took the air and the house took the girl and the court took the heat and the music room took the sound of the day. Contracts shook hands with brooms. The inspectors drove past and did not stop because their clipboards had gone for a nap. The light tried not to be nosy and failed, and for once it did not get in the way.
