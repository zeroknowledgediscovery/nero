     "novel_text": "The day Rima decided to adopt a tiger, the generator coughed and the lights blinked, and Beirut wore its usual necklace of noise. Hum of scooters and traffic, the salt breath of the sea blowing in and then out like a tired chest. A group of boys chased a deflated football down the Corniche while an older man watched the horizon for a ship that would not come. It was the kind of day that dared you to feel exceptional. So she did.\n\n\u201cYalla,\u201d she murmured into her coffee mug, as if speaking to the espresso. \u201cLet\u2019s do something unforgivable.\u201d\n\nShe had slept two hours and then drifted awake to the argument of pigeons on the windowsill. There had been emails, an assignment that paid too little, a blank document with the title TIGER, then a blinking cursor that made her feel judged. She had a joke she told herself: if she could not write herself into a new life, she would adopt one. A life with claws. A life that could not be ignored.\n\nShe knew it was insane. It was also a clean kind of insane, the kind that glowed with a mythic light in her head. Rima Haddad, thirty-four, from the place of fatherless daughters and lemon trees planted on balconies in plastic buckets, would bring a tiger to Beirut like a rumor. People would talk, in the way they did. She would write a book about it. She would become the sort of name that did not tremble when read aloud.\n\nOn the morning she made the decision, her mother called to ask why she had posted no photo of herself for a month.\n\n\u201cAre you sick?\u201d Salma asked. \u201cOr just stubborn?\u201d\n\n\u201cStubborn,\u201d Rima said. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cCooking. What else? I heard you haven\u2019t gone to the club in weeks.\u201d\n\nSalma always called the golf course the club, though she had never set foot there. In her mouth, it sounded more glamorous than it was. Rima had drifted into golf two summers prior because a profile piece on Lebanon\u2019s oldest course had led to a handful of free lessons, which led to the odd comfort of grass cut at mad precision and men in white shoes uttering soft curses over bad swings. She went not for the game but for the feeling of walking a quiet green in a noisy city, and because she liked Hadi, the caddy who never seemed to belong to the men he followed. He had a face like a clean sheet of paper and a habit of looking at her as if she were spelling things wrong.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d she told her mother now, lying as she crossed her toes. \u201cMaybe this week.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou used to send me photos from the bench under the big tree. Your hair was nice there. Put something nice.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe something wild.\u201d\n\n\u201cYa Rima. Be careful with your wild.\u201d\n\nIt took four phone calls and three almosts to find a way to make it happen. You\u2019d think there would be no door that opened onto a tiger, and maybe there wasn\u2019t, not in any official sense. But there was a message from a friend of a friend, a photograph that looked like a dream a child might have after eating too many apricots: the tiger curled into a crate like a painted boat, eyes too bright for the dull wood. The story was so ridiculous she did not question it\u2014smugglers had been caught, the animal was in limbo, a sanctuary in the Bekaa was full and the paperwork was water-marked with slowness. An acquaintance with a soft spot for disasters whispered there was a way to \u201csponsor\u201d the animal, to keep it nearby but not quite home. The word sponsor was like a lace thrown over something indecent.\n\n\u201cNot a pet,\u201d the acquaintance warned. \u201cYou can\u2019t put a leash on a wave.\u201d\n\n\u201cI write,\u201d Rima said. \u201cI don\u2019t leash.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the compromise was a building\u2014half abandoned, half music studio, a place where notes once clung to the damp walls, a cinema before the war and then not. The owner had fled to Montreal. The cousin of the owner wanted dollars, didn\u2019t care how. There was a back room not much larger than a shipping container with a high grate open to air and the scent of old cigarettes clinging to the paint. The street outside was one of those Gemmayzeh streets where you couldn\u2019t throw a rock without hitting a dream that had caught in someone\u2019s throat.\n\nShe went to see it with Leila, her neighbor with bangs cut crooked and a way of asking too many questions in a row.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not really doing this,\u201d Leila said, sliding past the iron door as if the building might bite.\n\n\u201cI am. Please don\u2019t send your brother to stop me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to send him.\u201d Leila paused. \u201cI was going to send your mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s worse.\u201d\n\nThe room smelled like damp and old peelings of paint. Rima ran a finger along the wall and came away with dust like flour. She could, theoretically, make a tiger\u2019s life here less terrible than in a crate. She could make it clean, at least, and quiet at the corners. She could bring in meat and ice and silence. She could sit and read aloud paragraphs that refused to behave.\n\n\u201cWhat will you name it?\u201d Leila asked.\n\n\u201cIt names itself,\u201d Rima said, trying to sound like a person who knew how to speak about enormous animals. The truth: she liked the idea of a tiger called Mishmish, which would shock purists who claimed that apricot belonged only to cats with whiskery snouts. \u201cIf it tells me, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sound like a fool.\u201d Leila\u2019s eyes softened. \u201cA shiny fool,\u201d she added, as consolation.\n\nThe night she signed the cousin\u2019s paper\u2014no stamp, no government letters, just the cousin\u2019s wide grin and a handshake that felt like a misunderstanding\u2014she walked to the sea to ask for permission. The sea said nothing. It exhaled a bit of foam, and a boy splashed it with his foot as if he could scold it into nodding. Somewhere behind her, a muezzin\u2019s call spread like a shawl over the roofs, and on a balcony a woman argued with her own echo.\n\n\u201cYa Rima,\u201d she said to herself. \u201cWhat if this is the thing that proves you do not know what you are doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI already know that,\u201d she answered. It did not make her turn around.\n\nNews in Beirut traveled like citrus, quick and exploding with scent. Before the tiger even arrived, word had emigrated from the abandoned cinema, hopped from hammock to hookah and lodged itself in mouths. A writer is bringing a tiger to Mar Mikhael, someone said. So these are the kinds of stories we are now. The man at the coffee cart shook out his napkins like flags and asked if she had lost her mind the way someone might ask for change.\n\n\u201cNot lost,\u201d she told him. \u201cRented.\u201d\n\nAbu Fadi, her landlord, did not see it. He was a thin man with thick eyebrows who liked to give out warnings the way other men gave out sweets. He had survived two property booms and the blast and a long marriage, so he believed he could survive anything except a tenant with a tiger. He stood in the stairwell outside her apartment, fingers knotted in a triangle like a child\u2019s attempt at a mountain.\n\n\u201cHabibti,\u201d he said, switching to the endearment only when he knew she would say no to his demand. \u201cThis is not allowed. It cannot be allowed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not in the building,\u201d Rima said. \u201cIt is in a different building that is not yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are my tenant.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am also my mother\u2019s daughter and my own head and my own rent. There are many things.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will have to raise your rent.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou already did.\u201d\n\nShe could not tell whether he was angry because he believed she would bring a danger into his life or because he had been left out of the decision. Beirut, for all its noise, had intimate rules. One of them was: do not make a spectacle on your own. If you are going to be ridiculous, invite everyone.\n\nShe told no one the day the truck came. It did not look like a truck for a tiger. It was unremarkable, dented, a beast that had carried its share of cabbages, and the men who climbed down from it wore the careful expressions of delivery men who will not ask questions if you behave like answers. The crate was heavier than she had expected and larger, as if it bristled with its own boundary. A white tarp fluttered like a lie over it.\n\n\u201cWhere do you want?\u201d the older driver asked, eyes on the ground, as if meeting the eyes of what he carried would tie him to it.\n\n\u201cInside,\u201d she said. \u201cThe back room.\u201d\n\nThere is a way the body knows when it is near the patience of something big. Her skin prickled the way it did when she swam beyond the buoys and imagined the belly of the sea turning below. They lifted, they dragged. The crate scraped the floor and left a bruise in the concrete. When they set it down, the air changed shape.\n\nThe tiger made a sound like a zipper dragged over teeth. It was not as loud as she had feared. It was the ordinary volume of a throat clearing itself. An acknowledgement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, because she had no other words and because the phrase had been spoken to her too many times to count. \u201cYou\u2019re here. It\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nAfter the men left, Rima sat on the floor, the dust half bright in a slanting beam of light, and put her face close to the crate. The tiger\u2019s eyes were yellow with green melted in, like somebody had left a shard of bottle to soften in sunlight. It did not look at her in the way a cat looks, as if you are a tide or a closed door. It looked at her the way the city sometimes looked at her\u2014interested, bored, unsure if she was worth the energy. She laughed. She could not help it.\n\n\u201cYou are not impressed,\u201d she told it. \u201cVery well. I am not impressed either.\u201d\n\nShe had planned for logistics. Ice. Meat. A tarp for shade. A hose. A heavy lock that was always to be doubled. She had not planned for the embarrassment that would fill her mouth when she tried, in the first hour, to say the name she had settled on in her head. \u201cMishmish,\u201d she whispered, feeling foolish immediately. The tiger blinked once, very slowly, as if it had been asked a question it had answered too many times in past lives.\n\n\u201cOr maybe not,\u201d she added. \u201cMaybe a different thing.\u201d\n\nShe texted Leila: It is here. And Leila: You are a ghost. I am at work. Send a picture. She didn\u2019t. It felt wrong, like intruding on someone in the shower. Instead, she put her notebook on her knees and wrote, not sentences but pieces. The city made a tiger, or the tiger made a city. The color of power is not orange but the hush before a door opens. Everything is a kind of adoption: apartment cats, ideas, grief.\n\nHer phone vibrated again. This time it was her mother. \u201cAre you free?\u201d Salma asked. \u201cI made mulukhiyah.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou love mulukhiyah.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing something.\u201d She hesitated. It would happen anyway, the telling. \u201cSomething complicated.\u201d\n\n\u201cComplicated like who you date, or complicated like when you tried to swim from the Bain Militaire to Raouch\u00e9 and had to be pulled out by that boy with the strange arm?\u201d\n\nRima smiled despite herself. The boy with the strange arm had become a recurring character in her mother\u2019s retellings. In the memory, his arm had been not strange but beautiful, a scar that looked like a river splitting a plain. \u201cNeither,\u201d she said. \u201cComplicated like a tiger.\u201d\n\nThere was a silence in which Rima could hear the television in the background in her mother\u2019s living room, and the kettle, and the sound of Salma\u2019s breath as she sought proof that her daughter was joking.\n\n\u201cYou are making words again,\u201d her mother said finally. \u201cIt\u2019s not real.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is.\u201d\n\n\u201cYa Rabb.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always wanted me to be ambitious.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted you to be married.\u201d A rustle, as if Salma had placed her hand over her mouth, not to stifle a sob but a laugh. Rima could tell the difference. \u201cNo, I did not want that,\u201d her mother corrected herself, surprising them both. \u201cI wanted you to be less tired. Does this make you less tired?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes me something.\u201d She pressed her fingers to the crate without thinking. The tiger shifted its weight, its fur dark and striped as a Japanese poem. Warmth moved toward her. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you pictures when I can.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t. I won\u2019t look. I will wait for you to come without pictures.\u201d\n\nIt was one thing to sit there in the first afternoon, drinking water out of a bottle that had lost its cold, whispering absolute foolishness to a massive animal. It was another to go home in the evening to her apartment door and her neighbor\u2019s door and the smell of frying onions through the hall. She half-expected to find the police on the stairs or Abu Fadi standing like a ragged awning, ready to collapse all over her with indignation. But the building did not know yet. A good secret can do that. It has weight, but it floats.\n\nInside her apartment were the ordinary objects of her life: the couch that had been her aunt\u2019s, the bookshelf her brother had built before he left, the plants that leaned toward the weak light like old women toward gossip. On the wall above her desk, she had placed a photograph of her father when she was a child\u2014him holding a plastic bat, wearing a grin that made his face look too open. He had died the kind of death that seemed to edge out all of his life, a suddenness that made every photograph a note of apology. She told him things sometimes, when she was brave enough to admit she still wanted to be understood by someone who had left the room.\n\n\u201cI did something absurd,\u201d she told the photo. \u201cAnd also good. I can\u2019t tell yet.\u201d\n\nShe slept badly, of course. She slept like someone who had handed her name to a stranger and worried it would be returned with a new spelling. In the morning, she went back to the cinema, carrying a plastic bag of butcher wrapped in butcher paper, and the tiger was awake and not asleep and awake again, a rhythm that made Rima think of a lit fuse that flickers and refuses to go all the way in. There was a discipline to how the animal moved. No wasted gesture. When she slid the meat into a low metal bowl through the bars, the tiger watched her the way a saint might watch a pilgrim\u2014amused, a little bored, silent.\n\n\u201cEat,\u201d she said, as if this one small command could balance all the others that were impossible.\n\nIt ate. Shudder of jaw, a sound that made the back of Rima\u2019s neck flex as if remembering a time when she had been prey in a myth she did not believe but that believed in her.\n\nLeila came at noon, beige slacks and a blouse that tried to behave, hair barely tamed. She stood at the threshold, not crossing, and stared. She had mascara on, which made her eyes look like someone had underlined them with a promise to try.\n\n\u201cHaram,\u201d she said softly. \u201cBut good.\u201d\n\nRima nodded. \u201cSay it: I\u2019m insane.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re insane.\u201d Leila stepped closer. \u201cWhat does it smell like?\u201d\n\n\u201cMeat and damp and something like a tire shop. And cinnamon, weirdly.\u201d\n\n\u201cCinnamon?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m making that part up.\u201d Rima put her hand on the doorframe. \u201cIt has a temperature. The room has a temperature.\u201d\n\nLeila slipped her phone out and then back into her pocket, guilty. \u201cCan I\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe later.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt needs grass.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt needs a thousand things I can\u2019t give it.\u201d Rima shook her head. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\nThey sat in the doorway, backs against stone, thighs dusted white, and talked as if they were girls again pretending to smoke. The tiger watched them and then did not. Outside, the city threw its usual parade. A truck of watermelons went bleating past, the driver leaning out of the window to argue with a honking, invisible opponent. Somewhere a hammer hit metal in the rhythm of a song from the eighties. A man practiced the oud with the windows open to prove he had a soul. Rima opened her notebook and wrote a sentence and then drew a line through it so that only the ghosts of letters remained.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to write about this,\u201d Leila said. \u201cOf course you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you will fall in love with someone inappropriate while you do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeila, please.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not wrong.\u201d\n\nRima was not sure if a tiger could smile, but sometimes the animal\u2019s mouth moved in such a way that a human might pour meaning into it. That afternoon, when the lights in the corridor flickered in and out because the generator had grown bored, the tiger lowered its head to the floor and let its tongue hang. It looked like a panting dog, which is not a dignified comparison for a creature that can swallow a deer, but it humbled him. No, her, Rima corrected. She had decided the tiger was a she because it made the story more complicated, which generally meant closer to the truth.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she told Mishmish who might not be Mishmish. \u201cWe are interesting together.\u201d\n\nThe first true objection came not from family or landlord or friend but from herself. On the fourth day, she woke to rain though the forecast had promised clear. Rain in summer in Beirut is a misbehavior that makes everyone talk about it as if weather were gossip. She walked to the cinema under an umbrella, the streets slick and gleaming, the puddles full of tiny, surprised fish of light. She arrived damp and agitated, unlocked the back door with too much hand, and found the tiger pacing in a way that made Rima want to ask forgiveness. It bounced, shoulder to shoulder, the pattern hypnotic\u2014four steps, turn, four steps, turn\u2014until the rhythm turned into a chant in Rima's head: You Are Repeating Yourself, You Are Repeating Yourself.\n\nShe gave the animal space and sat down on the floor outside the cage, pressed her forehead to her knees. \u201cI can\u2019t save you,\u201d she said, feeling the arrogant center of the sentence bruise under its own weight. \u201cI can only change where you are.\u201d\n\nHer phone rang. The name on the screen was Hadi.\n\n\u201cI heard,\u201d he said, without saying hello.\n\n\u201cOf course you did.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are trending.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not a verb.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are, a little.\u201d He let a chuckle fizz out and then took it back. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cDefine.\u201d\n\nRima imagined him standing near the short fence behind the ninth green, where he liked to watch golfers pretend not to cheat themselves of something. He had told her once that caddying made him feel like a man walking in a slow storm. He knew where every club was and where the ball wanted to go and he had no power to make anybody choose right. Hadi was not from Beirut in the way that Rima was\u2014born into the quarrels and tides of it. He came when he was twelve, fleeing something he did not tell her and a father who drove for a man who drove for a man. He liked to stand in whatever shade was available and name birds by their wrong names.\n\n\u201cWhat are they saying?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cThat you are insane. That you are brave. That you are lucky. That you are a Westernized soul. That you are a genius. That you are a problem. That you are hungry for attention.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of that is news.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso,\u201d he added, \u201cthat you should bring it to the club. The rough is so thick on the fifth that we will lose fewer balls.\u201d\n\nShe laughed more loudly than the joke deserved. The tiger paused and watched her for a beat and then went back to its restless walking. Hadi hearing that sound through the phone did something to the line. Static, like a secret metabolizing.\n\n\u201cYou came to my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought I should check your mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mind is a balcony with a broken rail.\u201d\n\n\u201cNice. Don\u2019t jump. Come swing tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter feeding a tiger?\u201d She considered it. There was something of penance in the idea. \u201cMaybe.\u201d\n\nBefore he hung up, he said, \u201cI bought a notebook.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor what?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo write what people say while they hit, and what they don\u2019t say. Maybe there is a book.\u201d\n\n\u201cHadi,\u201d she said, surprised by the sudden heat of pride in her throat. \u201cYou already write. You just haven\u2019t put it down.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d he promised in the tone of someone swearing he would do something impossible before coffee. \u201cI have plans.\u201d\n\nThat night, Abu Fadi slid a paper under her door with a signature of flourishes and a sentence that made no sense. It was an official invitation to cease ruining the building\u2019s reputation. He had stamped it with a stamp he had bought for himself years ago. He had once told Rima: if the stamp is red, the paper becomes serious. This stamp was red. It smeared.\n\nShe knocked on his door, paper in hand, and when he appeared, she held it up the way you hold a note from a doctor that excuses you from gym.\n\n\u201cI am ruining your reputation?\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone knows you are the one.\u201d He gestured as if her hair were a scandal. \u201cMy sister called me and said, What kind of people does your building take?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe kind with rent,\u201d Rima said. \u201cI have sent you this rent. You have cashed it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, your hallway plant is dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy hallway plant is struggling under the concept of July.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is dead. Throw it.\u201d\n\nIt felt good to quarrel about something small. It brought the air back into the room. She promised to remove the plant. He promised not to call the police. They looked at one another as if they were two very tired lions.\n\n\u201cShu,\u201d he said, softening. \u201cI\u2019m old. My heart does not want any more news.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen don\u2019t pick up the phone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to. I am the landlord.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to write,\u201d she said, and walked back to her door with the red-stamped paper that she decided to keep, for its ridiculousness, in a folder marked Important.\n\nBeirut can feel like a game of whispers and then, just as easily, like a shouting match where every door is a mouth. Rima started receiving messages from strangers. One asked if she was available for a podcast. Another offered the services of a brand new company that created unique experiences for influencers\u2014Would she like to host a pop-up tea ceremony for her tiger? An email from a young woman who signed herself Your Neighbor on The Internet said that Rima\u2019s choice made her think of the word caretaker in a different way. A man wrote to accuse her of colonial arrogance and also to ask if the tiger\u2019s eyes were as beautiful as in the photos that had been taken without her consent.\n\n\u201cPeople,\u201d Leila said, scrolling with a dismay that grew noisily. \u201cThey all want to be in the middle of the road and then complain about getting hit.\u201d\n\nRima turned off her phone for a day, which felt like plunging her head into cold water and leaving it there. She spent the hour before dusk sitting on a plastic chair in front of the tiger\u2019s enclosure, listening to the traffic become a lullaby and then a fever again. There was a rhythm to the city that she had not noticed when she was in the habit of speaking over it. Now that she was in the habit of listening, she felt it settle into her bones the way certain songs decide they own your walking.\n\nShe spoke, not to the tiger but to the air directly above its head. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to be looked at,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I like naming. I like the thing that happens when you point and tell yourself the truth about what you see.\u201d\n\nThe truth about what she saw shifted. Some hours, the tiger was the thing she had collected in order to become a larger person. Some hours, it was a mirror she didn\u2019t like. Some hours, it was simply itself\u2014an animal, wet nose and whiskers and a way of making the world look like it had been poured into a different shape.\n\nShe decided, finally, that Mishmish was the name she would say out loud, even if she used other names in letters she wrote to herself alone. Apricot. Sun. Pattern. Mistake. She stood one morning very early, in those moments when the city\u2019s loudness is clear and divided, and she said the name and it felt like throwing a seed at a hard wall and watching it split anyway. \u201cMishmish,\u201d she said. The tiger did not look, did not move, and yet the name landed.\n\nWhen she went to the club with Hadi, as promised, she felt foolish and sincere at the same time, always a strange couple in her. The course seemed greener in contrast with her concrete days, the palm trees the exact height of certain dreams of normal. Hadi handed her a driver like a blessing and a warning, both. He was not a caddy who whispered advice. He had learned she preferred silence shot through with jokes.\n\nOn the third tee, a man with a towel around his neck and a face like a dessert that had collapsed under its own sugar turned to her and said, \u201cI hear you have a tiger.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hear you have a temper,\u201d she said, as if she had a better hand than she did. He laughed too loudly, as men sometimes do when they are not used to being spoken to that way by a woman who does not hand them anything.\n\nHadi kept his eyes on the horizon and then peered back at her shot as if its arc spelled a word he had never seen. \u201cYou swung like you wanted something from the ball,\u201d he observed. \u201cYou can\u2019t want anything from it. It hears you.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything hears me this week,\u201d she said.\n\nBetween holes, he said, \u201cI\u2019m serious about my plans. I think I will meet someone. Like, a person who walks with people. You know.\u201d\n\n\u201cA therapist?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot that,\u201d he shook his head. \u201cA thing like that but with shoes you would wear to the mall. A coach for life.\u201d\n\nRima pictured Hadi\u2014whose advice usually came wrapped in the sound of laughter he tried to tuck away\u2014sitting across from someone who asked him questions until he surprised himself. The image softened the middle of her ribs. \u201cYou think you need a coach?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I think I need to keep walking. Sometimes a person joins you and tells you where the holes are so you don\u2019t break your ankle in the same place twice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds like caddying.\u201d\n\nHe flashed his clean sheet of paper face at her. \u201cYes, but for the body. Or the heart. Don\u2019t roll your eyes. I see you.\u201d\n\nShe hadn\u2019t rolled her eyes. Not exactly. She had rolled her brain. There was a difference. \u201cDo it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you do it, tell me what it is. If you don\u2019t, I will make fun of you for not doing a thing you said.\u201d\n\nHe nodded solemnly, then spoiled the solemnity by sticking his tongue out at her between two teeth like a boy.\n\nBack in the city, dusk slanted and then fell. She stopped for bread and tomatoes, and a man at the bakery told her the crust was better today because the oven had burned wrong all morning. \u201cSometimes you have to scorch first,\u201d he said, meaning the bread and not meaning only that. She wanted to tell him everything she knew about scorch\u2014the way the past leaves a mark in a building that smells like music that used to be sung there. The way the body carries a map of its previous extensions.\n\nInstead she carried her bread and tomatoes to the cinema and found a boy standing in the doorway holding a camera. He was probably twenty, hair in a messy pile, eyes too bright, an excitement that made his hands tremble.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said, not angrily but with the exhaustion of someone who knows that the sun will rise whether or not you ask it.\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he said, a word stretched into two syllables. \u201cI\u2019m a student.\u201d\n\nShe looked at his shoes, which were tearing apart at the sole, and at his camera, which was older than him. She thought of herself at twenty\u2014her mouth always open, her neck sunburnt every spring. \u201cYou can take one photo,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom here. And you don\u2019t publish it. You keep it. You put it on your wall. You tell your children you saw something ridiculous and beautiful.\u201d\n\nHe looked down the corridor as if opportunity were something that could be glimpsed like a stray cat and chased. He lifted the camera. The shutter clicked, noise small and satisfying. He lowered the camera and looked not at the tiger but at her.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, finally.\n\n\u201cBecause,\u201d she said with the idiot simplicity that is the only answer to certain moral math. \u201cBecause I wanted to be the person who could do it. Because I thought it would change me.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet.\u201d\n\nHe nodded as if she had offered him a glass of water and he had chosen to look at it instead of drinking it. \u201cIt will,\u201d he said with the certainty of the young. She didn\u2019t correct him. She liked his certainty, even if she didn\u2019t borrow it.\n\nThat night, she lay on her back on the floor of her apartment because the electricity had gone, because the fan was a dead soldier, because her bed felt like a trap. She listened to the neighbor\u2019s TV sputter and then fall silent. She listened to a plane that sounded too close. She listened to her own heart, which beat like it had a rope around it pulling it forward and back. She thought of her father again, of the way he had liked to teach her rules for games he did not play well. \u201cStand over the ball,\u201d he had told her when he pretended to teach her golf by tossing an orange into the air and catching it. \u201cDon\u2019t think about your body while you use it. If you think about it, it will be shy.\u201d\n\nShe thought of Hadi telling her about the coach he would hire, and she thought of Leila\u2019s eyes when she saw the tiger, and she thought of Salma refusing to look at photographs to make her daughter more likely to come home with her real face. She thought, not for the first time, that wanting to be changed by something is itself a way of looking away from your own lines, your edges, your name. She wasn\u2019t ready to argue with that thought. She pinned it gently to the wall like a moth under glass.\n\nIn the morning, she wrote for an hour without stopping, which in her world was the equivalent of a small miracle the size of a walnut. She wrote in a style that did not quite belong to her, because she had always been a liar about style, always trying on dresses that pinched at the ribs. She wrote about adoption and the way it is an aggressive tenderness. She wrote about Lebanon being a woman who had smoked too much and laughed anyway. She wrote a phrase she knew she would cut later because it sounded like something too ambitious, and also because she half-believed it: The tiger does not bend to me, and that refusal becomes a translation of my life.\n\nShe printed nothing. She sent nothing. She folded herself into the day like a note into a pocket. At noon, she went to the cinema and fed Mishmish and held a hose like a priestess and made a small pool on the floor and watched the animal put her paws into it with surprising delicacy. At three, she answered three emails and threw seven in the trash. At six, Leila texted her CAN I BRING SOMEONE? and then did not wait for the answer before arriving with a woman with a black bob and an aura of command. \u201cThis is Maya,\u201d Leila said, too quickly. \u201cShe edits things.\u201d\n\nMaya looked at the tiger\u2019s eyes the way a person looks at a painting she has decided to buy and then smiled at Rima with the smallest tilt of approval. \u201cAnd this,\u201d she said to no one, \u201cis a narrative that does not want to be wrangled.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does not want to be anything,\u201d Rima said. \u201cIt wants its old life.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\n\nRima almost said yes because it would have been a neat shape to hand someone who edited things. She almost said no because she wanted to be unpredictable. What she said was, \u201cI want my current life to feel like I noticed it.\u201d\n\nMaya nodded. \u201cI can pay you for a piece,\u201d she said, calm as a woman selling shoes. \u201cSomething not annoying.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can try to be not annoying.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t. Be annoying and then make it sing.\u201d\n\nThey stood in the doorway for a while, the three of them, looking at Mishmish who seemed, suddenly, absolutely uninterested in them. It was perfect. A person who has never been ignored properly will not fully understand how power works. Rima, who had been ignored by the right people at the right times, recognized in the tiger\u2019s not-looking not an insult but a gift.\n\nWhen they left, the street had shifted half a centimeter, the way it does every hour in this city, the light deciding to be liquid or not. Leila kissed her cheek twice and whispered something silly about buying a leash as they laughed and then agreed to feel bad about laughing. Maya put a hand on Rima\u2019s shoulder only for the time it took a sparrow to change its mind about a wire.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let this become a costume,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Rima said. \u201cI know, I know.\u201d\n\nAlone again, she sat and counted the minutes and then lost track of counting. She thought of Hadi and his notebook, of him writing down the beautiful, ugly sentences men say about their swings, about their wives, about their power. She thought of how he would hand those sentences to the person he would pay to walk with him into himself. She thought, in a way that embarrassed her slightly, of asking him to bring her along when he went. Not to heal, not exactly. To watch.\n\nShe did not sleep. She drifted. The following morning, an inspector of some sort came with a folded portfolio and a mustache that could have led, alone, a policeman\u2019s parade. He peered at the lock, at Rima, at the dimness of the room, and at his own fancy shoes.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d he repeated, helpless as a man whose job requires him to be sure. \u201cThere are forms.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring the forms.\u201d\n\nHe did not bring the forms. He brought a shrug that had been stitched with bureaucracy. She gave him a look that had been tempered by years of bureaucracies. He left and told someone. She told someone. By the end of the day, it had become a story about how the city would tolerate anything except the wrong kind of paperwork.\n\nHadi called at sunset. \u201cI met someone,\u201d he announced without greeting. \u201cNot for love. For the life coaching thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlready?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you, I had plans. Her name is Ghida. She looks at you and you feel like you are lying, even if you are reading your passport to her.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I booked a session. I will go on Wednesday.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want out of it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, honest. Then added, \u201cTo be less stuck. To stop making jokes when I mean something serious. To not be the friend of my own excuses.\u201d\n\nShe sat down on the curb in front of the cinema and watched a stray cat consider a cigarette butt. \u201cBring me something,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cA sentence that belongs to you with no laughter in it.\u201d\n\nHe hesitated. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cI will try.\u201d\n\nAfter she hung up, she looked at the tiger, whose breath made a soft fog on the bars when it exhaled. She looked at her hand, which had a crescent of blood where she had caught it on the lock earlier. She looked at the sky, which was the color of the inside of a fig.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be changed,\u201d she told the air. \u201cBut maybe I just wanted to be worth this story.\u201d\n\nThe tiger blinked slowly, then closed her eyes, and for a moment the room\u2019s temperature and the sound of the street and the beat of Rima\u2019s pulse and the history in her bones aligned like teeth in a good zip. She laughed once without a reason, the purest kind. The laugh did not cure anything. It made no good decisions. It was a small, true thing that came anyway.Heat arrived like a verdict. The city wore it with the bravado of a man in a tight suit, one button too proud, one breath away from splitting. The generator in her building coughed, gathered itself, and then sulked into sleep more often than it should, as if offended by the idea that air should be cooled for free. Rima learned the timings of ice the way she once learned exam schedules, and she walked with a plastic crate under her arm to the alley where the ice factory operated behind a blue door that had been repainted so many times it looked like a palimpsest of winters. Inside, men in sleeveless shirts ceded space to slabs pushed out of a steel mouth, the blocks slick and milky as if the weather could be cut into bricks. The owner, a gentleman who introduced himself as Uncle Sami though he was probably younger than he wanted to be, looked at her crate and then at her face and then at her hands, which had acquired a geography of small scrapes.\n\n\u201cFor fish?\u201d he asked, not unkind.\n\n\u201cFor a tiger,\u201d she answered, because she had set herself the discipline of not lying in July.\n\nHe contemplated this with a seriousness that was both theatrical and real. \u201cI had a cousin who loved canaries,\u201d he offered, as if this established kinship. \u201cThey don\u2019t like heat.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one does,\u201d she said. \u201cExcept tomatoes.\u201d\n\nHe laughed, delighted to be carried into a logic that collapsed and still delivered them to the same place. When she asked for credit, he asked for a story. She promised him one good paragraph about his blue door and the way he wrapped ice with paper the color of the old flag. He frowned and said that flags made him itchy, then gave her an extra half-block because she had not asked for a discount, only permission to carry water in its coldest shape away from his domain. Outside, the air hit her like a mouth exhaling. By the time she reached the cinema, wet silicone had gathered under her arms and her shirt stuck to her back like a rumor.\n\nThe graffiti appeared two days later, the kind of handwriting that tried to be a stencil and failed, which made it more like the city than if it had succeeded. On the iron door: WE ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH PREDATORS. She stood and read it twice, then a third time, as if the words would soften under repetition. Leila arrived behind her, holding an iced coffee in a cup that perspired like a child after running, and tilted her head.\n\n\u201cAt least they spelled predators right,\u201d she said, always the teacher grading a pop quiz she had not assigned.\n\nRima ran her thumb over the P, which had a drip that made it look like it was crying. \u201cDo they mean me, or the tiger, or my landlord?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey mean anything a woman does that is bigger than somebody\u2019s idea of her.\u201d Leila took a long, savage sip. \u201cAnd also men, but men are used to being blamed for everything, so it rolls off.\u201d\n\nThey bought paint from the hardware store where the owner liked to hum the chorus of old songs while mixing colors. He leaned close to the letters and then to their faces, static on his fingers from the tape measure that hung from his belt like a tail. \u201cYou want to keep it, make it prettier?\u201d he asked, as if graffiti were a pet that demanded grooming.\n\n\u201cWe want to erase it,\u201d Rima said, and he nodded as if this was a haircut he understood. They painted in the late afternoon, the shade creeping inch by inch across the door like a confession that took its time. The first coat made the words ghostly, the second made them memory, the third felt like wiping a fever off a child\u2019s forehead.\n\n\u201cYour brother asked about you,\u201d Leila said without looking over. \u201cHe saw something online and pretended he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell him I adopted a watermelon,\u201d Rima said, and Leila\u2019s laughter snagged on the edge of her mouth and then fell free. There was comfort in the choreography of tasks\u2014stir, stroke, step back\u2014and in letting the ridiculous sentence stand between them like a small umbrella. When they were done, they stood back and admired their work, and for a second the door was simply a door, a surface that said nothing except handle me.\n\nThe NGO woman arrived wearing a cardigan in weather that had made men abandon dignity and shirts. She had the calm of a person who had written her name on too many forms and learned to sit inside time while it passed noisily around her. She introduced herself as Noura, said the words animal welfare without letting them sound like accusation, and stepped into the shade as if onto a stage she had paid for.\n\n\u201cWe heard,\u201d she said, and lifted her hands to indicate that the hearing had not been optional.\n\n\u201cEveryone hears,\u201d Rima replied. \u201cThe city is an ear with a mouth attached.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a center in the north,\u201d Noura said, and named a place that had once been a battlefield and now tried to be a field. \u201cNot perfect, but better. There is also a route out, with conditions. Paperwork is a sea monster. Money is its brother.\u201d\n\nRima felt the familiar scissors of shame open and close under her ribs. She watched Mishmish shift in her patch of shade, watched the ripples of muscle under fur like a map of dune ridges. \u201cI want better for her,\u201d she said, and heard the arrogance stitched into the sentence, the way it assumed her wanting had any weight at all. \u201cI also want to finish something I started.\u201d\n\nNoura\u2019s mouth made the shape of sympathy without the obsequiousness of it. \u201cThat is the problem with stories,\u201d she said. \u201cThey make you feel like a god, and then you look in the mirror and remember you are not even in charge of your hair.\u201d\n\nRima put one palm flat on the cage because she had not learned yet to stop herself. \u201cCan I come?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf she leaves.\u201d\n\nNoura looked her over like a doctor looks at a patient who has just asked to be allowed to be complicated. \u201cYou can come to the fence,\u201d she said finally, not unkind. \u201cLater, we can talk about roads. This is Lebanon. You know what roads are.\u201d\n\nRoads in Lebanon were episodes of a long-running show with sudden plot twists that made grandmothers throw slippers at televisions. Trucks disappeared on them. Lovers became exes and then furniture and then ghosts. Rima did not ask Noura to promise. Instead, she took a pamphlet that had been printed on paper too gentle for its subject and read the names of animals who had been saved and felt both relief and skepticism take turns in her throat.\n\nShe went to meet Maya in a caf\u00e9 where the coffee was strong and bitter, the way people claimed to like it when what they really liked was a story in which they behaved well under pressure. Maya was wearing a white shirt that had the casual crispness of a shirt that had never touched a sink. She waved without standing and slid a glass across the table as if she had been born to slide glasses in elegant arcs.\n\n\u201cI want three thousand words,\u201d Maya said, settling the numbers between them the way men settle cards. \u201cNo romance with your own adjectives. No saints. A problem with an animal that has your name in it somewhere and does not apologize for needing things.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do that,\u201d Rima said, not because she was sure but because the sentence had to be said by somebody and she was the only person at the table.\n\n\u201cYou can, but will you.\u201d Maya reached into her bag and produced a pen with a weight that made the table feel morally sturdier. \u201cThere is also the matter of protecting yourself. People will try to take your piece and make it proof of something they planned to say before you wrote it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople always do that,\u201d Rima said. \u201cIt is what they do at dinner.\u201d\n\nMaya smiled at the tiny cruelty tucked into the observation. \u201cI like your mother,\u201d she said as if it were a line in the piece. \u201cShe refused the photographs. That\u2019s a kind of discipline I recognize.\u201d\n\nRima thought of Salma\u2019s voice when she said I will wait for you to come without pictures, the way she had made love into a rule so that her daughter would be safer inside it. \u201cShe might come,\u201d Rima said, then corrected herself. \u201cShe will. She won\u2019t be able to not.\u201d\n\nHadi\u2019s voice came to her that evening over the grind of a bus that needed love desperately and the petulant bleating of a horn that needed to be banned. He stood on the sidewalk outside the club, she could tell by the birds in the background and the way he enunciated when he was pretending not to smoke.\n\n\u201cI went,\u201d he said, and took a breath that made her sit down without thinking.\n\n\u201cTo Ghida.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Her office is in a building with a dentist on the first floor. I could smell fear and mint.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did she ask you?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo tell her about my day without joking. I failed twice and then did it. She asked me who I hold umbrellas for when it rains.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hold them over men who forget rain is wet.\u201d He swallowed, and she could feel his throat through the line. \u201cShe asked me what I want to stop holding. I said, I do not want to be useful to men who think I am part of their equipment.\u201d\n\nRima pressed her fingers to her mouth, not to stop herself from speaking but to keep something from falling out that would make this less clean. \u201cThat is a sentence with no laughter in it,\u201d she said, satisfied in a way that felt like relief and pride holding hands.\n\n\u201cThere is more,\u201d he added, because he could not stop himself from making excess out of adequate. \u201cShe asked me what I want to be useful to.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what did you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to be useful to the part of me that stays when no one has asked me to carry their bag.\u201d\n\nShe closed her eyes and saw him with his hands empty. It shook something in her, the clean image of that. \u201cGood,\u201d she whispered, and then said it again, louder. \u201cGood.\u201d\n\nSalma arrived the next morning carrying a shopping bag as if it were a shield. The heat had made the city\u2019s old ladies sensible; she wore a cotton dress and her hair pulled back with a clip she had owned since before Rima was born. She stood in front of the cinema and refused to look up at its face, the way one refuses the gaze of a person one has not yet decided to forgive.\n\n\u201cI brought you okra,\u201d she said. \u201cI know you hate it. You will be forced to come to me to make a proper sauce.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can make a proper sauce,\u201d Rima lied on instinct, then stepped aside. \u201cDo you want to come in?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not want to, but I will.\u201d Salma stepped into the dim, her hand reaching for the wall without needing to see it. \u201cThis building smells like someone left a violin here.\u201d\n\nThey walked the corridor like two women visiting a relative in prison. At the threshold, Salma paused. Her eyes adjusted and then did not. Her breathing changed shape. A mother can stock the air with a hundred kinds of silence. This one was the silence of respect. Mishmish lifted her head and watched without the menace that Rima had feared and without the docility that would have felt like an insult. If there was a version of meeting that involved the exchange of breaths rather than names, this was that.\n\n\u201cHe is beautiful,\u201d Salma said, and Rima did not correct her. She rested the bag on a chair and leaned her knuckles on the table so that her hands would be doing something other than reaching.\n\n\u201cDo you remember,\u201d Salma began, a question that carried its own answer, \u201cwhen your father brought home a bird in a cage and the cage smelled like rust? I cried for the bird and then stopped crying because he looked like someone who had rescued it from a war. He kept it for a week. I wanted to hate him for it and then the bird left. He left the door open one afternoon by accident, and it took the window like a man takes a second chance. He did not forgive himself. He bought another cage and kept it empty for months.\u201d\n\nRima did not remember the bird. She remembered the empty cage, a square that seemed to catch light in its corners and make the living room too clever by half. She remembered putting her hand in and out and spanking the air. \u201cWhy did you stay,\u201d she asked, because the question was itself a family heirloom, inherited and avoided.\n\n\u201cBecause I had a child who loved a man who told her rules like they were jokes,\u201d Salma answered. She turned her head then, fast, and saw the two yellow coins of Mishmish\u2019s eyes blink and reopen as if counted. \u201cAnd because I did not know how to go anywhere else. People always think staying means not wanting the door. Sometimes it means not trusting the stairs.\u201d\n\nThey sat, mother and daughter on plastic, the tiger breathing in a rhythm the body wants to match when it is brave enough to admit it needs a metronome. Salma talked about the woman upstairs who watered her balcony plants with a hose like a dance, about the cousin\u2019s son who had married a Canadian who called bread bread and not khobez and had made the wedding taste foreign. Rima listened with the greedy attention she had when her mother\u2019s sentences decided to open a small window and let the wind come through. When Salma stood to go, she touched Rima\u2019s cheek with the back of her hand, the gesture of a woman who had measured fever that way for a lifetime.\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d she said, which in her tongue was a prayer and a threat and an oath. \u201cWhen you are ready to stop pretending this will make your name softer, call me. I will help you come back to stupid things like washing curtains.\u201d\n\nAt dusk, the generator died in so theatrical a manner it might as well have bowed. The air in the back room turned into a hand on the neck. Mishmish began the restless pacing, the four steps that made a square on the floor with each repetition darker than the last. Rima\u2019s stomach did the small contractive dance that precedes panic, a choreography she had learned so well she could do it while reading. She opened every possible door and window. She stood with a cardboard panel and moved air like a penitent doing a humble job for a capricious god. The boy with the old camera appeared again at the entrance, standing very still, as if motion would make him unwelcome.\n\n\u201cGo home,\u201d she yelled, then softened because his face crumpled. \u201cBring your mother a cold towel. She needs it.\u201d\n\nHadi came without being asked, the way rain comes to certain kinds of heat whether or not anyone prays. He stepped in with the calm of someone who can split a task into steps even as his own shirt stuck to him and his hair turned into small commas across his forehead. He took the panel from her and fanned with a rhythm that rejected urgency without denying it. In crisis, you learn the grammar of who you are. Hadi, it turned out, had verbs that surprised her.\n\n\u201cWe need ice,\u201d he said, and when she pointed to the half blocks, he broke them with a hammer he found like a magician produces scarves. They wrapped bits in cloth and placed them near the bars, not within reach, close enough to persuade the air it could be kinder.\n\n\u201cTalk to me,\u201d he told her as he worked, because he had learned to give the mind a song to sing while the hands did their ugly dance.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said but then found that she could. She told him about Noura and the road, about Maya and the three thousand words, about Salma and the remembered cage. She told him about the graffiti and how painting felt like mending a dress she didn't even like. He listened with the kind of attention that made the room feel less like a test.\n\n\u201cI was scared once,\u201d he offered, breath even, panels fluttering like flags in his hands. \u201cAt a checkpoint, when we were new and my father made a joke because humor is the only weapon we had, and the boy with the gun did not understand the joke and I thought I would be orphaned by a sentence. Every time a man raises his voice near me in the wrong way, the checkpoint steps out of the walls.\u201d\n\nRima absorbed this and then felt something unclench in her spine. The tiger stopped pacing, which felt like an agreement unrelated to what they had said, and lay down with an annoyance that mirrored the city\u2019s own attitude toward weather. They kept fanning longer than necessary because the body needed a ritual after it had decided to live again. When they stopped, the fan heaved once like a soldier who realizes he can sit.\n\n\u201cCome with me when I take her,\u201d she said, the words sliding out before she had decided to let them exist. \u201cIf I take her.\u201d\n\nHadi folded his panel and leaned against the doorframe, his shadow long and thin, a line drawn by a child learning to make the world less complicated by putting borders on it. \u201cIf they let you,\u201d he said, which was the right answer and the only one. \u201cWe can draw a map that is honest about its missing pieces.\u201d\n\nHer phone stuttered with messages that evening, as if every person she had ever met wanted to participate in the weather. Maya sent a photograph of a headline about a tiger that had been smuggled in cucumbers, proof that absurdity traveled with stamps. Noura sent a reiteration of conditions, of points where money had to be red and signatures blue and the word sanctuary would be written in a font that did not exist in any printer in a two kilometer radius. Leila sent a photograph of her own face with a filter that gave her whiskers and wrote under it, This is what people think activism looks like. Salma sent nothing, which was a message that made Rima smile.\n\nAbu Fadi knocked at nine, a gentleman\u2019s time for an uninvited visit. He held a standing fan older than much of the building, its metal cage dented by a history of clumsy shoulders and children. He did not apologize for its condition. He set it down in the middle of her floor and plugged it into a socket he had once forbidden her to use. He stood with his hands behind his back like a tour guide in an empty museum.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a boy,\u201d he said, staring at the fan in case life required it to misbehave, \u201cmy father took me to a checkpoint where they had a lion. The boys with the guns fed it chicken and called it security. I could not sleep for three days. I do not like animals inside cages, but I do not like them outside in the wrong mouths either. Take this. Bring it back when the weather has decided to become polite.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, which sometimes meant I see the thread you hide and the knot at the end of it. \u201cI will,\u201d she added, and knew a part of him would be watching her window to see when it disappeared.\n\nShe wrote that night under the fan\u2019s ancient breath. She wrote until the fan changed its hum to a higher pitch that meant it wanted to be left alone. She wrote a paragraph about ice that would make Uncle Sami proud. She wrote about the law of cities that makes certain acts possible and others impossible, and how law could be two things at once: protection and costume. She wrote about the first time she had held a line in her hands\u2014literal rope when she was eight and they had gone on a boat she had not asked to go on and she had leaned too far over the side and her father had said hold here and she had, knuckles white, not because she was strong but because she had not been offered a choice. She ended her page with a sentence that embarrassed her and saved it anyway: Sponsorship is a word that puts lipstick on hunger.\n\nMaya answered in the morning with a dot, then another, the punctuation of thoughts forming. When the words came, they were a small avalanche. Keep the sentence. Build a bridge to it. Do not let anyone wear the tiger like a coat in your piece. Let the heat be a character. Let the door be a country. Rima laughed aloud at her phone the way one laughs at a child making the correct noise while asleep. Outside, the city\u2019s voice warmed up in scales, horns checking their anger, scooters finding their notes.\n\nNoura called with a date shaped like a question. Rima repeated it to the air and then to Mishmish, whose ears moved in opposite directions like two women arguing before deciding to arrive at the same conclusion. The plan involved sunrise and a truck that would not look like a truck and a man who did not like asking for money but liked receiving it. It involved a checkpoint that consistently misbehaved, and another that, for reasons nobody understood, had grown tender in recent weeks. It involved being small. It involved being loud at the right moment and silent at all the others.\n\nHadi arrived with a small duffel bag and the look of someone who had packed more courage than clothes. He took the schedule from Noura\u2019s hand and folded it, then unfolded it, fingers tracing the route as if he were reading a prayer and checking where it might fray. Leila came with dates and almonds and a look she reserved for the first page of a new notebook. Abu Fadi did not come, but his fan stood in the corner, solemn as a witness. Salma called and did not say be careful. She said, if something happens, make sure you are wearing sensible shoes.\n\nThe night before, Rima could not make her body lie flat. She occupied chairs like a woman sampling fates. She stood in the doorway of the back room listening to Mishmish sleep, the animal\u2019s breath a saw going through soft wood. She picked up her notebook and put it down. She tried to list the stupid things she would be glad to return to: washing curtains, oiling the door, buying parsley too enthusiastically. She tried to imagine what she would write if the morning went well, and then what she would write if it did not. She settled finally on telling herself the simplest promise she could make. Tomorrow, you will carry. Tomorrow, you will stand where you are needed without making it a story until later.\n\nBefore sunrise, the city yawned. Its soldiers of bread rose from their beds, its cats finished their brief wars, its early walkers took the Corniche in a silence they would deny when asked. The truck arrived looking like any other thing that moves through streets, its dents a history of someone else\u2019s errors. The man at the wheel had eyes that had seen so many forms they had stopped believing in signatures. Noura clipped her hair back with the aggression of a nurse preparing a shot. Hadi rolled his shoulders like a swimmer about to measure his reach in a hostile sea.\n\nThey moved quietly because loudness is a currency you must save for the places where it buys you a little more time. The crate welcomed Mishmish like a room that remembered her dimensions. Rima stood at the door, and when the tiger hesitated, she did the one arrogant thing she allowed herself with animals and people she had promised not to manipulate. She stepped back and looked away, letting the space between them say I am not making you do this. When the lock slid, it made a sound that in the city\u2019s language means consequences will now arrive whether or not you ordered them.\n\nThe door to the street was open to a sliver that felt like mercy. Outside, a man swept dust from one place to another because this is what one does when one has a broom and the morning asks for proof of life. A woman in a headscarf counted coins into a child\u2019s palm. Somewhere a radio declared a number of dead and then moved on to weather without apologizing for the juxtaposition. The truck\u2019s bed took the weight of the crate and groaned as if it wanted to complain in public and then decided not to. Rima climbed into the cab because she did not know where else to put her body that would not be in someone\u2019s way.\n\nHadi paused at the door and looked at the room the way a person looks at an old apartment one last time, taking inventory not of objects but of the shape of mornings and nights. \u201cYou locked the back?\u201d he asked, already certain she had. \u201cYou remembered the bag of documents?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d she said, her hand on the stack of papers that had acquired the texture of talismans. \u201cI put them in plastic. The man with the stamp will want them to smell like nothing.\u201d\n\nLeila pressed her face to the crate for one second and whispered something Rima did not catch. Noura touched Rima\u2019s shoulder with two fingers, a benediction with no god attached. The driver cleared his throat once, a signal rather than a sound. The fan in the corner watched them with its broken dignity. The city inhaled. They rolled.The truck spoke in shudders and declarative sentences, each pothole a period that made them sit up straighter. Dawn painted the buildings with a kind of mercy it withdrew by noon, turning edges tender and scaffolding into a lace that did not cut. Rima watched the street unspool in a grammar she had always loved, the comma of a man pausing to adjust his shoes, the semicolon of a woman stopping to greet a neighbor before continuing. In the back, the crate made its own syntax, the quiet thump of weight shifting and the low, threadbare rasp of breath. Hadi sat forward with his forearms on his knees as if the road needed the additional attention, while Noura kept the documents on her lap like a lapdog that might bite if not stroked occasionally.\n\nThey passed the bakery where men already wore flour like medals and the electricity shop where coils of wire slept in the heat. A boy on a scooter pulled alongside for the length of a single glance and then took off again, as if his life could tolerate only one surprise before breakfast. The driver, who had introduced himself as Adel and then told them not to use his name even in their thoughts, kept his gaze nailed to a middle distance that was probably safer than any of their faces. He spoke only to the truck when the gear stuck, a private conversation he managed with a tender impatience that made Rima momentarily jealous.\n\nAt the first light, before Charles Helou shrugged them toward the highway, Hadi reached back and thumped the crate gently twice with the flat of his hand, the way you thump a stubborn heartbeat. \u201cWe are moving, habibti,\u201d he said in a voice that had learned new shapes from Ghida\u2019s traffic cones of questions. \u201cWe are not good at moving, but we are doing it anyway. You can be unimpressed.\u201d The tiger answered with the sound of a zipper again, softer this time, as if agreeing to the terms without endorsing them. Rima wanted to put her forehead on the wood in thanks, but Noura looked at her and shook her head once, just enough to make the lesson land: do not teach this animal that your skin is a part of its map.\n\nThe sea slid in and out of view like a shy relative, then asserted itself in a sheet of pewter as they skirted Bourj Hammoud, Jdeideh, the industrial blocks with their dust and stubborn manliness. Billboards promised things the city laughed at: a gate to a gated life, a watch that could stop time before it got embarrassing, an apartment with the kind of light you rented elsewhere. Rima\u2019s phone quivered and then died the way a sparrow does, quick and apologetic. She put it facedown on the dash out of habit, as if respecting its tiny funeral would keep it from rising out of spite.\n\n\u201cThis first one,\u201d Noura said, not naming the checkpoint as if names invited accidents, \u201clikes the idea of itself. It wants to be told it is necessary. We will give it that. We will do it in blue ink. You will not say more than hello.\u201d She pressed a finger against each of their wrists in turn, a silent consecration that felt practical in a way religion sometimes failed to be. Adel grunted, then lifted the corner of his mouth slightly as if the road had told a joke no one else had caught.\n\nTraffic thinned and then congealed again around them in the human-weather pattern Rima had once tried to explain to an American editor who thought gridlock should be linear. A truck full of melons adjusted itself in their lane and then remembered dignity and moved back. A bus belching black thought for a moment that it was a sports car and then remembered things about weight. When the concrete of the first checkpoint rose like a sentence fragment ahead\u2014tired sandbags, a canopy that had once been white, the soldier\u2019s chair at a tilt\u2014Rima felt her throat do the small, ridiculous tightening that years had not trained out of it. Even in a city that had taught her the difference between danger and drama, a gun tilted at your world remained untranslatable.\n\nThe young man with the vest the color of resentments put his palm up and Adel stopped so gently Rima loved him for the first time. The soldier walked to the driver\u2019s window and bent half his body into the cab as if he had been invited. His mustache was a declarative mustache, the kind you trusted to have opinions. Behind him, another soldier smoked as if the cigarette had married him too early and he was doing his best to love it. Noura passed the first paper, then the second, each sheet he read with that particular outward boredom that means inside him a hundred little calculations were happening about potential money, potential trouble, potential time.\n\n\u201cWhat is this,\u201d he asked finally, gesturing toward the back in the tone of a person who already knew what this was but wanted to hear your version. He lowered his head to peer past her shoulder, eyes narrowing the way they did when men tried to see in bars with bad lighting and got fooled by their own certainty.\n\n\u201cElectrical components,\u201d Noura said, and her voice wore a cardigan too, a soft that concealed steel. \u201cHeavy. Certified. For a humanitarian partner. It is not wise to disturb them because of the calibration.\u201d She put her finger on a stamp in the middle of the page, and Rima watched his eyes do what eyes did in this country in the presence of ink that had chosen a color with confidence. The soldier nodded at the stamp as if it had greeted him by name.\n\nFrom the back, Mishmish exhaled, and the soldier\u2019s lashes lifted because even men who loved stamps had instincts. Hadi leaned forward with the ease of someone who had learned to offer distraction like an appetizer and tilted a plastic cup toward the soldier\u2019s hand. \u201cCoffee?\u201d he asked with a sincerity that made Rima want to kiss his cheek for all the times he had given parts of himself to men with guns and gotten away with it. \u201cIt is too early to work without it.\u201d\n\nThe soldier hesitated as if an unseen director might shout cut, then took the cup and sipped and made the face of a boy whose mother had taught him to behave in front of guests. He handed back the papers with a small flourish that meant he wanted to be remembered for conceding. \u201cGo,\u201d he said, and then, as if the word were offensive, added, \u201cQuickly.\u201d Adel did as told with the practiced timing of an accomplice to a magic trick, upshifting away from the gaze that clung and then let go.\n\nPast the checkpoint, the horizon behaved as if its job were to reward humans for surviving bureaucracy. The road widened, the sea announced itself, and a line of cranes drew a clumsy ballet against the sky. Rima surprised herself by placing a hand on her chest not to calm her heart but to congratulate it for not showing off. She looked at Hadi and he looked at her and in the small tilt of his mouth she read a sentence without laughter. He did not need to say it. She loved him for that restraint.\n\nThey rode the shoulder of Antelias, then Jounieh with its guiltless seafront churches and strip of newer sins. Men walked their shirts over their heads as if decency could be rearranged to please the weather. The truck groaned into climbs that made its bolts confess things, then slid down into a speed that felt briefly like a promise to the future. Chekka\u2019s cement factory rose to their right in a pale, powder-caked geometry, a monument to the kind of industry that made lungs into family heirlooms. The tunnel swallowed them and then spit them out with the relief of bad cinema that knows it is bad and so tries to overcompensate with brightness.\n\nThey had to stop for ice at a fishmonger\u2019s along the road in Kfar Abida, a low-slung store with styrofoam boxes stacked like the teeth of a patient who had decided to show everything. The boy who came out to see what they wanted had salt drying in the creases of his elbows and eyes that could have belonged to a seal. \u201cFor fish?\u201d he asked, because the world needed its refrain, and Rima almost told him no, for God, but Noura spoke smoothly about temperatures and Adel lifted his chin to indicate the urgency.\n\nWhile the block was slid with newspaper into their crate, Rima walked three paces away and bought lemonade from a woman who had the forearms of someone who squeezes truth out of things for other people\u2019s relief. The glass was sweating the way all their faces were, and the first sour swallow shocked her into something like gratitude. Hadi accepted a sip with a theatrical grimace and then kept the cup longer than manners instructed, so she reached for it and their fingers knocked softly as if applauding one another for arriving at this morning with a courage they did not have two months ago.\n\n\u201cSecond one is worse,\u201d Noura said when they were rolling again, half apology, half weather report. \u201cThey have a man with a new job. Men with new jobs want to make history with your time.\u201d She did not look at Rima when she said it, which was kindness, because it allowed the fear to be shared among them like bread rather than pressed into someone\u2019s hand like a bill you owed.\n\nThe poles that marked the second checkpoint appeared as if they had planted themselves out of stubbornness alone in a place that did not need them. The canopy here was an arrogant blue, and the chairs under it looked like they might refuse to break even if asked kindly. A radio crackled the way radios do when they are tired of being the heart that gets carried into every small war. A sign with too many words tried to perform legality and failed, which is the closest approximation of law Rima ever fully believed in. Adel took his foot off the gas in a way that made the truck consider the idea of stopping and then accept it as fate.\n\nThis soldier did not bend himself into anyone\u2019s cab. He stood and let them come to him, a trick of posture that men learn from tall dogs. He looked at the papers with the disinterest of someone who had decided in advance that the papers would be interesting only if they contained money. The second soldier, a young woman whose hair was tight under her cap in a way that made Rima\u2019s scalp ache, took two steps forward and then two back as if practicing for choreography that demanded both forwardness and retreat. The heat had made everyone theatrical.\n\n\u201cWhat is that sound,\u201d the man asked without moving his mouth much, and Noura said the same sentence in the same cardigan and tapped the same stamp in the same place. The woman took a half step to her left and, against her will or because she was the kind of person who could not help being alive even in uniform, snuck a glance at the back where the tarp had a corner that lifted and dropped with the rhythm of breathing. Rima knew it was breathing because she knew the tiger\u2019s metronome now, but to the eye with less practice it might have been the truck itself, tired of work.\n\n\u201cIt is too early to open,\u201d the woman said, addressing no one in particular in the tone of someone who had agreed with herself in the morning about something and was not prepared to argue with that person yet. \u201cYou will break it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will not open,\u201d the man countered, because any sentence hanging in the air needs its opposite to anchor it in Lebanon. His eyes flicked to Hadi, whose posture radiated the plausible deniability of a cousin hired to carry things. \u201cYou,\u201d he added, because the pronoun pleased him, \u201ccome down.\u201d\n\nHadi did, his shoulders loose, his hands out from his body not in surrender but in the offering of a man who knows how to demonstrate he has nothing useful to steal. He moved like a metronome, slow, deliberate, the tempo of someone calming horses. \u201cMy uncle will kill me if this calibration is disturbed,\u201d he said without smiling, and the soldier\u2019s eyes did that tiny narrowing again, the calculation recalibrating, the word uncle finding a hook on which to hang an outcome. In this country, uncles were both real and omnipresent and fictional and useful. They were also occasionally the state.\n\nNoura let money arrive the way pity should: quietly and in proportion to need. She did not peel off a bill like a magician pulling silk from an unlikely sleeve. She placed a thin bundle inside the sheaf of papers in a position that required flipping to find it. The soldier executed the flip with the unhurried ease of a man choosing to remember he was human. The bills were old in the way money gets old here, corners soft, numbers a joke the currency had played on itself. He did not smile. He cleared his throat in a way that meant agreement and a small shame. The woman looked away not out of softness but as an accord to dignity, which in some places is the same thing as compassion.\n\nOn the far side of this permission, the road opened and then narrowed again, every purchase on progress a limited-time offer. The sea darkened to a serious blue. The grass on the median attempted nonchalance and failed. Tripoli drew nearer in smells and silhouettes, the castle keeping its watch with the resigned patience of old authority. Noura spoke briefly into a small radio that looked like a toy and was not, her Arabic elegant even when she was arranging trucks. Adel\u2019s knuckles whitened once and then remembered themselves. Hadi allowed his head to fall back against the seat for the width of a sigh.\n\n\u201cDo you think she knows,\u201d Rima asked finally, and even as the pronoun left her mouth she hated how it made a person out of an animal in a way that served her. \u201cWhere we are going, I mean. Or is this just\u2014another room.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe knows the weather,\u201d Noura said, and it was such a clean answer that Rima sat with it like a stone in her hand, noting the shape. \u201cAnimals know heat and movement and the moods of people holding doors. She knows you, because you sit in one position like a person who plans to be forgiven. But she does not know north from south the way we think we know it. She will know better when we stop.\u201d\n\nThe sanctuary\u2014or the idea of it, because the word felt delicate in their mouths\u2014sat inland on the slopes where olive trees did the work of old men, watching and producing and insisting on their usefulness. The turnoff was foolish and then became a road with arrogant stones and then a track that belonged more to donkeys than to dented trucks. A boy with a balloon stood watching from a wall as if waiting for applause for simply existing so well in this heat. A goat declared its opinion of them in a voice that made Rima think of her landlord\u2019s stamp and how the two were equal in power in many situations.\n\nWhen the gate appeared, it didn\u2019t at first. It was the absence of movement where fences began, the way boundaries make a silence around them to alert the attentive. A man with heat-swollen knuckles swung the gate back, his face giving away nothing except that he had learned to love animals and people in the precise ratio that kept him from breaking. He nodded at Noura, then let his eyes rest for a second on Rima as if acknowledging that strangers collected their own disasters and delivered them like gifts that were both welcome and not.\n\n\u201cKarim,\u201d Noura said into the air and then into his hand when he offered it, and the gatekeeper\u2019s mouth made a shape Rima recognized from men who had been asked for more than they had to give and refused to become bitter as payment. He led them to a low stone building whose interior had been scoured into cleanliness, the kind that looked like a promise kept one thousand times in small ways. A chain-link pen stood to the side like a mouth mid-sentence, and beyond it a field where shade was an argument that trees had nearly won.\n\nThey did not open the crate at once. Animals do not need your catharsis more than they need order, and Karim lifted a finger in the air to hush the urge to see her step into her new constraint. He tuned the room the way musicians tune an instrument no one will play. Water first, then quiet, then the low murmur of human intent bending itself to usefulness. Adel stood just inside the door and for the first time allowed his body to confess fatigue, which made Rima appreciate him as a creature rather than an instrument. Hadi took the coil of rope from the floor and tested its give, not because it would be used but because hands need a task when the heart is near the edge of a pond it has been told not to fall into.\n\n\u201cLater, we try the enclosure,\u201d Karim said, finally letting language join them officially. \u201cToday, we let her breathe a new square. Tomorrow, we move the sky.\u201d His smile cut his face in a way that was tender and ugly at the same time, which is to say true. \u201cYou waited for this,\u201d he added, and Rima felt seen in the way that made her grateful and angry, a combination that had fueled many of her jokes and too many of her mistakes.\n\nWhen the locks slid, she stood at a distance she measured with the rules Noura had given her and the ones her body had learned in the last month. Mishmish stepped forward with the offended grace of a queen getting off a plane that had not landed on time. The scent of new dust slipped into the old dust like cousins meeting for the first time at a funeral. The animal took the light with her like furniture taken out of a room modifies the remaining shadow. She turned once, a half circle that made patterns blur, and then settled on a patch of concrete that felt, perhaps, like its own absence of catastrophe.\n\nKarim moved without moving, the kind of stillness that is work. He kept everyone behind an invisible line he had drawn in his head years ago and could lay across a floor with precision. He held a hose in his hand not pointed at her, letting the notion of water populate the room before its reality arrived. He spoke under his breath to Mishmish and to the air and to the mistakes of men who had brought animals here in worse situations and demanded miracles out of polite rooms. Rima did not cry, because she did not want to see herself crying in this story at this point. She allowed her face to rearrange itself quietly, which is one of the few strengths she inherited from Salma without resenting the source.\n\n\u201cI will come back?\u201d she asked Noura and then regretted the question because of the upward tilt of the last word. \u201cIf I can, I mean. If you say my face will not make her ask for a different room.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can come,\u201d Noura said. \u201cYou can also learn how to leave. Both are acts. We practice both.\u201d It was not a comfort and it was not not a comfort. It was a sentence Rima recognized as having been written long before either of them spoke it.\n\nThey stood for a time that couldn\u2019t decide what it was\u2014long enough for Mishmish to close her eyes and open them again and close them once more, long enough for the sweat on their backs to confess itself through fabric, short enough that they kept thinking of the truck as still moving. The sounds here were different from the city, not quieter exactly but less busy with themselves. A donkey complained in an alto that made Rima smile despite herself. Somewhere a dog hit exactly three barks and then reconsidered the point. The wind admitted that it had been to the sea and come back with gossip that did not concern them.\n\nLeila messaged that she had eaten half the dates she had packed for them and felt guilty and then better, a very Leila sequence. Maya sent a question mark and Rima answered it with the outline of a tiger drawn with too much wrist, which Maya would either berate her for or frame. Salma did not call. The empty space where her mother\u2019s voice would be settled itself at the base of Rima\u2019s spine and kept her upright in a way the truck had not.\n\nLeaving the crate felt like leaving a church after lighting a candle. You exit into light you are not ready for, and you think about errands before you should and you half expect the sky to insist on solemnity and of course it does not. Karim shook Adel\u2019s hand in a way that honored the driver\u2019s part of the prayer. He put a hand briefly on Hadi\u2019s shoulder and said something low that made Hadi nod, a single sharp thing that looked like agreement with himself. To Rima, he offered nothing except a long look that took in the thin newness of her and returned to her an older thing she might be able to wear.\n\nOn the way back, the road changed its order because roads are like that around here, but also because the vehicles moving on it had gathered other stories during the hours they were occupied elsewhere. The billboard now featured a different woman whose teeth promised a different future. A man with a ladder moved it from the shoulder to the bed of a pickup with a balletic seriousness that broke into laughter when the ladder kissed him on the ear. Hadi leaned his head out of the window and let the heat clap his cheeks in the way of an elder admonishing and blessing in the same gesture.\n\n\u201cYou did it,\u201d he said, quiet so it could be true without ceremony. \u201cYou tried to make a door and then you helped someone walk through it. It is less insane in the doing than in the saying.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought it would make me\u2014\u201d she began, and stopped before the word famous could humiliate them both. \u201cI thought it would make me more like the person I want to be when I think about myself in the dark.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are exactly as annoying as before,\u201d Hadi said kindly, and she let herself laugh because both halves of the sentence had room for that. \u201cMaybe there is less noise between your ears. Maybe not. We will see.\u201d\n\nWhen the second checkpoint appeared again in reverse it behaved like a different man who had borrowed the same body. They were waved through without fanfare because unpredictability had clocked out. The first did not look up from his phone. By the time Beirut\u2019s shoulder rose to meet them, the air had grown thick with afternoon and the promise of generator breath. The Corniche was full of pairs and trios walking the length between memory and practicalities. The city had not changed while they were gone, which should have disappointed her and did not.\n\nBack at the cinema, the iron door blinked at her new paint in the overstated light of four o\u2019clock. The fan waited where she had left it, patient and old and obnoxiously correct. Rima stepped inside and the absence of the crate struck her like an extra sense she hadn\u2019t named before. The room was emptier in the way a hand is emptier once you have taken off a ring you didn\u2019t always like. She stood in the middle and let that hollowness ring against her ribs until it found the note it wanted to hold.\n\nThe first thing she did was pick up the hose and coil it with the care of putting a child\u2019s arm into a sleeve. The second thing she did was sit on the plastic chair and put her feet where the square of pacing had darkened the concrete, a small sacrilege that felt like measuring her shoe against a footprint at a museum. The third thing she did was open her notebook and write three sentences about the way a truck sounds when it carries something that resembles consequence. The fourth thing she did was text Salma: She is in a place with trees, and then wait for her mother to not answer, because that too was a way of being answered.\n\nHadi peeled himself off the doorway and stretched his back, then announced that he was going to buy too much watermelon and that she had no choice but to help him eat it. When he left, the hallway coughed up a neighbor who wanted to tell Rima about the eggs she had found that morning with shells so thin it felt like breaking promises with her breakfast. Rima listened with governmental attention, nodding in the right places, and when the neighbor asked about \u201cthe matter\u201d, Rima said something so bland it graduated into poetry. \u201cWe are practicing being less ridiculous,\u201d she answered, and watched the relief move across the woman\u2019s face like shade in a courtyard.\n\nShe slept a little on the couch with her mouth open, an unglamorous sleep she had been snobbish about once and now regarded as a gift. When she woke, her body had learned three new translations for the word tired and the heat had learned another way to be inside her. She went to her desk and wrote without aiming for herself, the way a person waters the part of a garden that doesn\u2019t belong to her so she can look at it later and remember that the world makes things she didn\u2019t plan. The first paragraph was about the morning, the second about the second soldier\u2019s eyes, the third about the way money feels when it is wrapped in paperwork like a bad truth dressed as a good one.\n\nAt some either-or hour, the phone vibrated with Salma\u2019s name and Rima did not pretend she might not pick up. Her mother\u2019s voice wore a layer of fatigue that had been ironed flat by competency. \u201cI bought soap,\u201d she said without greeting, which was her greeting. \u201cThe curtains are so filthy I am embarrassed to hang them in any story you will write. Come tomorrow and we will make the kitchen smell like lemon and old television.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come,\u201d Rima said, and was startled to hear herself sounding as if she believed she deserved a quiet job. \u201cBring me news about the woman who waters with the hose.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe watered too much,\u201d Salma said with the satisfaction of someone whose predictions of folly had been validated. \u201cHer basil is offended. It is still alive. You can be like the basil, habibti. Offended and alive.\u201d\n\nAfter they hung up, Rima went back to the cinema and stood in the doorway as the day divided itself into the two cities everyone always had to choose between: the one with electricity and the one without. She thought of Mishmish, of the rectangle of shade Karim had calibrated, of Hadi\u2019s shoulders at rest when he finally let himself sit on the stoop with a wedge of watermelon and spit seeds with the joy of a boy who had been given permission to be vulgar. She let the thought of Maya\u2019s deadline press against the front of her skull the way a pet presses a nose against a hand it might let bite. She did not try to make the next day come faster. For a woman always in love with the next paragraph, it felt like letting a wild and inappropriate animal put its head in her lap and keep it there while she breathed.\n\nWhen night came, it did not perform. It slid in with the minor chords of generators and a cat\u2019s yawn and the sigh of a city that had once again chosen to live despite having reasons to abstain. Rima took Abu Fadi\u2019s fan back and he looked at the empty place where the crate used to be and said nothing about it, which in landlord was a compliment. He did tell her the plant in the hallway had made its decision and that death did not need to be discussed in public. She thanked him like he had given her something, because he had.\n\nOn her way back upstairs, she saw the boy with the messy hair sitting on the steps, his camera in his lap and his head leaned against the wall in that uncontrolled posture of someone who could nap even through artillery. He opened his eyes when he heard her and smiled, and for the first time since he had appeared in her doorway she liked him without needing to mother him or warn him off. \u201cDid it work?\u201d he asked, and when she nodded, he lifted the camera not to photograph her but to hold it to his own forehead like a cool cloth. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, and there was such clean belief in the two syllables that she wanted to give him a paragraph to keep in his pocket like a talisman.\n\n\u201cGo home,\u201d she told him, and then sat with him for five minutes exactly, saying nothing, watching the staircase\u2019s shadows with the precision of two people who had watched enough dramatic things to recognize the quiet ones that mattered more. He stood when she stood and they nodded at each other as if exchanging identifications. On the last step, she thought she heard the sea breathe, which was ridiculous and also correct. She went inside and closed the door gently so it would not forget it was a door and not a drum, and the city outside kept talking to itself in a language she had finally stopped pretending she did not speak.The curtains made a sound when they came off the rod that reminded Rima of a small animal surrendering, not loud enough to be tragic, just audible enough to register. Salma had stacked bowls of lemon halves like bright moons along the edge of the sink, and the radio on the counter insisted on giving recipe tips between traffic updates in a voice that had survived three wars without adjusting its tone. Soap foamed with a sting that made the pads of their fingers feel both punished and absolved. In her mother\u2019s kitchen, even fatigue felt domesticated; it sat in the chair with the broken cane seat and agreed to participate in discussion in the proper order. They worked without performing it for each other, because work memorized between two people is its own dialect and requires no glossaries.\n\n\u201cYou tie the knot the wrong way,\u201d Salma said for the first time that morning, and it was a sentence that could have applied to the curtain rope or to a list of Rima\u2019s romances. Rima smiled because she liked the way her mother made critique sound like heritage. The window pulled a stripe of heat over their forearms every time the breeze lied and pretended it would be relief, and the lemon made the air smell like somebody had tried to erase an old mistake with a citrus eraser. Salma\u2019s hands moved with the fluid bossiness of a woman who had taught a sock to become a puppet because the child in front of her had demanded entertainment when money refused to participate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m writing the piece,\u201d Rima announced, and the pronoun was the only piece of swagger she allowed herself in that kitchen. \u201cMaya wants it with a spine. She says if my sentences do not have backs, readers will hang their coats on them anyway and complain when the coats fall.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen to the woman who wears crisp shirts,\u201d Salma replied, because style was not separate from authority in her book. She turned the curtain so that the clean side accused the dirty side, and the contrast embarrassed them both a little. \u201cWrite, but don\u2019t leave words like snakes under people\u2019s beds. We already have mice.\u201d\n\nRima thought of the mice in the back room of the cinema, the way they had adjusted their routes around a crate that smelled like wilderness. She thought of Karim\u2019s hands that had held rope and hose with equal competence, and of Mishmish stepping into a rectangle of new air with a queen\u2019s skepticism. She told her mother only the parts that could be told without making the room tilt\u2014the road, the second soldier\u2019s eyes, the bit of road where the sea decided to be serious. Salma listened with the concentration she reserved for recipes that did not belong to her lineage and therefore required extra humility. When the curtains hung again, wet and temporarily dignified, they were heavy as a promise kept for now.\n\nThe piece grew around the sentence Maya had bossed her into keeping like a woman makes soup around a bone she refuses to toss. Rima wrote in the morning because her body had conceded that resistance at eleven felt like silliness and at seven felt like a principle. She wrote about the heat as if it were an uncle with a loud laugh who visited every year with the same jokes, and about paperwork like a sea monster that occasionally let a boat pass when it was in love. She described the truck\u2019s grammar without showing off, and the men who decided whether she could pass as if they had invented ambivalence and wanted credit for it. She wrote about her fingers wanting to slide between bar and fur and the way adults teach themselves to stand back when they want to step forward, and she kept that paragraph even though she feared it made her look sentimental in a way she had mocked in other people.\n\nMaya sent back notes that were half scalpel, half flirtation. She deleted three metaphors because they were doing the same work with worse clothes, and she circled a line about sponsorship with a pencil that must have been expensive because even the mark felt rich. Keep this. Bury it where no one expects to find it and then let it walk out on its own legs. Rima found herself obeying with a pleasure that at nineteen would have offended her, because she had confused obedience with surrender and had not learned yet the difference between good editors and dictators. They met once at a caf\u00e9 where the spoons were cold on purpose and where the barista had revolutionary forearms. Maya took the seat facing the door and glanced at Rima\u2019s mouth when she laughed as if checking for a small lie. \u201cYou have a dangerous relationship with your endings,\u201d she said, and Rima answered that she had worse relationships with other things, so she would take that as progress.\n\nHadi came to her apartment the day before his third session with Ghida and sat on the floor with his back against the couch because the fan was honest there. He wore a T-shirt with a logo that had meant something once and had washed itself into anonymity. From his pocket he produced a slip of paper that had been folded and refolded into a piece of origami that did not exist. He passed it to her without ceremony and chewed the side of his thumb not because he was nervous but because he had never learned a better habit.\n\n\u201cI told a man no,\u201d he said while she unfolded. \u201cAt the ninth, the one who throws his club as if gravity were flirting with him. He told me to clean his ball with my shirt because the towel was \u2018tired\u2019, and I told him I was not an extension of his laundry. He laughed and tried to make it a joke, and I did not let him have it. He called me difficult. I told him that difficulty is movement when you are used to a wheelchair.\u201d\n\nOn the paper, in his precise letters that somehow managed to look like someone apologizing to a line, he had written a sentence that carried its own weight correctly. I do not have to be agreeable to be good. Rima read it twice and then a third time in the same way she had read the graffiti on the iron door, and this time what dripped was not accusation but relief. She told him that if he wrote twenty more sentences like this he would have a stack a man could sit on. He looked at her with the wide open face he hated and loved when it took over and then ruined it by sticking his tongue out, which was a relief to both of them because earnestness should be interrupted by ridiculousness at least once an hour in this heat.\n\nNoura called with the tone of someone requesting a favor while also delivering good news and asked if Rima wanted to come up to the sanctuary on a day that would be unwise to drive but perfect for a small ceremony. \u201cThe sky is wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cBut Karim says the animal is ready to feel grass that remembers bigger feet. If you come, you do not own the moment. You are invited to borrow it. Wear shoes that will forgive rocks.\u201d Rima agreed and then put down the phone and stood still for a full minute because sometimes stillness was a superstition and sometimes it was a way to let the news move through without getting stuck.\n\nThe sanctuary smelled different when the heat stepped back temporarily and let the earth breathe. Trees made shade that wasn\u2019t an apology but a plan, and the insects made a choir so industrious it sounded like a factory run by gossip. Karim nodded once at her from under a hat that had once been a better hat and motioned toward a gate at the far end of the pen where Mishmish had learned the new square, the chain-link singing quietly the constant high note it kept whether or not anyone listened. The small procession was absurd and precise: Noura with a clipboard as if paper could domesticate fate, Karim with a length of rope on his shoulder he would not use, two volunteers whose eyes had learned the trick of being present without becoming a mirror, and Rima with a watermelon under her arm because Hadi had given it to her with a grin and a knife and the idea that rituals could be invented for animals who did not need them.\n\nThey opened two doors that had agreed to behave like one, and then they opened the idea of the sky. Mishmish considered it the way a woman considers a dress she has always admired on other bodies. She stepped onto the shade first, which was sensible, and then the sun, which was not na\u00efvet\u00e9 but an experiment. Her paws adjusted the way small boats adjust when moved to bigger water, and her breath changed and changed back in a rhythm that told Karim it was fine and told Rima that whatever gratitude she wanted from this creature would be a human thing she would have to give herself. The animal bent her head to the grass the way a queen lowers her face to a bouquet from an obedient city and then, in a gesture that made Karim exhale a laugh he had not authorized, she rolled onto her side once with both dignity and abandon. The fence when struck by sunlight made a careless lace all over the square of her and then stopped making metaphors because it was a fence and had no right.\n\nThere were other animals at the edges\u2014eyes that had learned to accept squares in exchange for not being eaten, ears that had learned the privacy of listening when men used the wrong voices around them. Rima did not ask their names because she had begun to respect the inefficiency of not knowing things. Noura signed three lines on a form that appeared to be the same form as yesterday and yet was not, and whispered to Karim about a hyena that had grown good at refusing medical interventions and a monkey that had fallen in love with a broom. \u201cLet her smell you,\u201d Karim told Rima when they had stood enough in their corner to be polite, and Rima reached her hand no farther than the air that remembered her. Mishmish glanced, blinked once, and returned to her grass. It was exactly the right amount of affection in a story that had remembered not to be hers.\n\nThe piece went online on a Thursday night that felt like Tuesday because calendar arithmetic had stopped working weeks ago. Maya had given it a title that Rima would have never given anything she wrote because it behaved itself and got to the point without wearing jewelry. People read it with the greedy speed of boredom given food, and then they read it slower, and then they sent it to their mothers and to their enemies. The line about lipstick and hunger lodged in the city\u2019s mouth the way a piece of pita gets stuck against the back molar and cannot be dislodged by tongue alone, and the paragraph where Rima confessed to wanting to be considered worthy of a story brought her inbox both praise and knives.\n\nA woman wrote to say that she had hated Rima for two days for being exactly the kind of writer who thought her feelings should be allowed to drive, and then she had forgiven her because of the sentence about ice that reminded her of her father\u2019s hands. A man wrote to tell her he had taken photographs of bears in Syria and had never told anyone because the bears\u2019 eyes had made him stop believing in light, and he had cried in his bathroom not because of her but because chemicals in the traffic fumes had made him sentimental. An uncle wrote to say that the word sanctuary irritated him, and a girl wrote to ask if the tiger\u2019s stripes were really as symmetrical as they looked in cartoons. Noura called to say that three people had inquired about donating without their names being written anywhere and that even if two were lying this was a miracle and a half. Maya sent an emoji she would never admit to owning and a message that said, now do not enjoy your little fame in a way that breaks the piece\u2019s back.\n\nLeila arrived the next day with a haircut that had committed to its own unevenness and a story about her boss that required a chair because indignation should be told from a higher place. She had ordered a protest T-shirt online and it had arrived with the slogan misspelled by one letter, and somehow that error had described the whole country more perfectly than anything else had that morning. She wanted to quit, and then she wanted to burn the office down, and then she wanted to ask her mother if she could move home and become the version of herself who thought she would be a teacher because chalk had looked like magic. Rima told her to quit for fifteen minutes every day as practice and to stay for the other twenty-three hours and forty-five minutes as an experiment. They sat on the floor with watermelon and spat seeds into a bowl until the bowl resembled a small conspiracy.\n\nAbu Fadi caught her on the stairs with a look on his face that was arguing with joy about whether it was appropriate to appear in public. He had read the piece because his nephew had sent it with too many exclamation marks and he had said he did not like exclamation marks because they were unhygienic. \u201cYou did not embarrass our building,\u201d he informed her, which was his native dialect for congratulations. He told her the plant in the corridor had finally chosen dignity and had been replaced by a snake plant that would not dare die in this heat because it did not have the necessary imagination. When she thanked him for the fan again, he waved away gratitude as if it were a fruit fly and asked if the fan had stopped making that high whining noise that meant its bearing needed oil. She was, in that moment, overwhelmed by the tenderness of men who think they are talking about machines when they are talking about love.\n\nThe boy with the older camera found her outside the bakery, waited until she had finished being told about the oven\u2019s mood by the baker, and then showed her his one photo. He had kept his promise. He had taken it from the threshold so that bars and light and the idea of an animal had been invited to share the frame without any one of them feeling used. It was better than proof. It was the sort of photograph that made you think of windows. \u201cCaption it with one sentence you can\u2019t take back,\u201d she told him when he asked what he should do with it. He nodded like a person accepting medicine from a spoon and promised to try. He asked her then if writing felt like this all the time, like balancing a bowl of water and laughing because you were not allowed to spill. It felt nothing like that, she told him. It felt worse and better and sometimes like dry bread.\n\nOn the Corniche, twilight made men into silhouettes that looked taller and women into punctuation marks placed carefully in the sentence of the day. The sea breathed truths it refused to share with anyone who asked for them by name. Rima walked to the bench under the tree that had always understood hair and took from her bag a notebook and a pen that worked only if held at the correct angle, which was to say stubbornly. She had promised herself a page that was not about tigers or laws or the heat\u2019s biography. She wrote about a boy she had once loved for three months and then pretended not to know because he had called her his mountain and she had realized she wanted to be river. She wrote about the woman who watered her basil too much because of fear and then corrected herself, watering less because she had converted fear into discipline, which is one of the few miracles available to civilians. She wrote four sentences that no one would ever read and felt the fan of Abu Fadi\u2019s apartment turning somewhere above like proof that small machines can make decisions in your favor when you are not paying attention.\n\nGhida called her because Hadi had given her number and asked if she wanted to sit for an hour in a room where the chairs made no sounds and the curtains had been chosen by someone who knew what you were doing with your eyes when you lied. Rima told herself she was going to see what Hadi talked about, not because she needed anything. She sat on a couch that did not claim to be anything else and listened to a woman ask questions that were knives with soft handles, and she surprised herself by not performing. The hour stretched and contracted and then finished. She did not cry. She did not become new. She agreed to come again because agreeing to come again was the least dramatic way to tell herself she had noticed something.\n\nAt the club, a week later, she stood over a ball and did not ask it to give her anything except its flight. Hadi watched with his arms crossed in an arrangement that looked casual and was not. \u201cSwing like you have already written the paragraph,\u201d he coached, which was either ridiculous or the only useful thing anyone had ever said to her about sports. She swung and found, to her irritation and delight, that the ball obeyed an agreement she had not made consciously. The man with the towel around his neck watched and kept his mouth shut because the day was hot and he had used his jokes elsewhere. Hadi did his small owlish nod that meant he was proud and would deny it later if it made the air sticky.\n\nThe city did what it always did with other people\u2019s business: it took it and made it taste like the thing you already had in your mouth. The piece spawned counterpieces and endorsements and a sticker on a lamppost that made Rima laugh because it was a cartoon of a tiger wearing a keffiyeh and sunglasses and the word APRICOT underneath in a font that would embarrass a child. Someone spray-painted THANK YOU on the iron door and then someone else added FOR WHAT? and then a third person drew a flower with six petals that looked like it had been painted by a woman on a phone call that had lasted too long. She bought a paintbrush and did nothing because the door had become a conversation and not participating in a conversation is one form of speech.\n\nNoura sent a video ignorant of the concept of resolution in which Mishmish stood with her head up in a light that did her stripes a favor and then lowered it to push her cheek against the wire as if the world were a thing that could be nudged into a more favorable angle. Karim wrote two words under the video that were not a caption so much as a verdict: She remembers. Rima watched the video with the particular jealousy one feels for animals who know where they are without having to name it, and then she walked home and made eggs and burned the first one and laughed alone in her kitchen because even breakfast half the time is betrayal and romance.\n\nThere was a protest on a Saturday that drew the city into one place briefly like a magnet makes a shape out of filings. Rima went because staying home is also a political act and she had done too many of those this year already. The signs were better than two years ago because everyone had learned to spell in anger and to not rhyme when rhyme made things silly. A man sprayed water in an arc that made strangers bless him for being generous in public, and women stood with their backs to the cameras so that their faces would not be borrowed for arguments they did not want to join. Rima walked beside Leila and did not talk because chanting felt like karaoke and she had never liked karaoke, but she liked the way the chant moved through other people\u2019s ribcages and made them taller for an hour. When the line dissolved into smaller lines and then into individuals moving toward hummus, she felt for a moment the particular sadness of people who know they will go home to the same walls and the same bills and the same threshold and that the world changes so slowly it sometimes looks like a statue.\n\nMaya asked her to sit on a panel about stories and animals and the way cities digest both without chewing, and Rima almost said yes because a chair with a microphone is a love language she has been trying to divorce for years. She said no and then walked to the room anyway and stood in the back like a teenager and listened to people say useful and useless things in equal measure. She went home and wrote about washing curtains instead, and when Maya read the paragraph about lemon and apology and the dignity of rod and fabric, she wrote back a one-word email that made Rima tear up because it was exactly the praise she had always wanted. Finally.\n\nHadi told her he wanted to stop caddying soon and to try to be the person he had imagined out loud as a joke, the one who walked with people and named holes before ankles found them. He had two clients who were both women who liked to pay for things up front and a boy who had refused money and brought him, instead, three mangos and a book of poems with half the pages uncut. He asked Rima to help him write a page that explained what he did to people who did not believe in anything except receipts. She agreed to sit and ask him questions until he had answers that wanted to be written. They did that work at a table in a caf\u00e9 with chairs that were slightly too low for the table, which made the whole business feel like humility. His sentences arrived reluctantly and then, when they felt safe, came fast, like stray cats deciding the hand being offered was not a trick.\n\nThe first rain in September arrived with the arrogance of a guest who had been late on purpose. People stood at their windows pretending to find fault with it so they could explain later why they had not invited it in. The drops were enormous and spaced wide as if a sky had to remember how to do this work after too many months of fire. The smell of dust being made into mud slipped under doors and into shirts and bent the shoulders of men who had forgotten to call their sisters. Rima walked to the cinema for the pleasure of watching water make the floor dark and round, and found the boy with the older camera standing under the awning wearing his father\u2019s jacket. He told her he had written his sentence and she asked him to read it aloud because some phrases exist only in mouths. He cleared his throat and looked at the photograph and said, softly and a little too fast, I did not know a cage could teach me the size of my own hands. She told him to slow down and say it again and he did and the rain approved with a louder spell of itself.\n\nSalma came with plastic bags tied like balloons and a vegetable stew that had not asked to be anything other than what it was. She sat on the couch and called the fan an old man for falling asleep mid-conversation. She told Rima that the woman with the hose had become famous in the building for killing thrips by flicking them with a nail she refused to cut, and that neighbors had begun to ask her for basil as if she were a bank. They watched a drama on television in which a sister betrayed a sister for a man who owned a restaurant, and they argued in a low voice about whether it was believable that any woman would abandon a sister for the owner of a restaurant that served its hummus with pink peppercorns. When the episode ended on a cliff and the commercials arrived with their plastic gusto, Salma turned to her daughter and said, as if passing salt at dinner, \u201cEnough with animals for a while. Write about something stupid like laundry. We need that stupid. It is our vitamin.\u201d\n\nShe went back up north once more in that season because the roads permitted it and because Karim had said the animal had learned a path around the enclosure that was hers and he wanted Rima to see it once and then stop coming for a while. She stood at the fence with her fingers flat against the air and watched Mishmish trace a map that had been drawn in her muscles, a loop that looked complicated and was not. Birds made announcements without translating themselves for humans, and an olive tree released a single leaf with the solemnity of a man signing a treaty. Karim told her that the animal had scratched herself on the rough trunk of a tree and had not bled, and that he had been relieved in a way he could not explain to anyone who had not waited all afternoon for an animal not to bleed. He told her that one of the volunteers had cried because she had looked into Mishmish\u2019s eyes and seen patience and forgiven herself for none, and he had told the volunteer to stop using animals as mirrors and to buy a plant.\n\nOn the way back, traffic at the second checkpoint held them like a sentence refuses to end when you are tired. The man with the mustache was not there; a new boy had taken his stool and was trying to learn the moral weather. Noura, on the phone with someone whose voice was all vowels and deadlines, waved and got a wave back and Rima watched a village\u2019s worth of power exchange itself in two small gestures and a flick of a wrist. She was, for a moment, overcome with a love for predictability so intense it made her think of extinguishers mounted on walls, and then someone cut across two lanes and nearly removed their side mirror and she remembered where she lived and smiled at the road even though it could not see her.\n\nAt night, she wrote a paragraph about hands. She wrote about her father\u2019s and Karim\u2019s and Hadi\u2019s and the boy with the camera\u2019s and Abu Fadi\u2019s and her own when they gripped a rope or a pen or an orange thrown as a golf ball or a soaked curtain being wrung out in a kitchen that had cataloged more disasters than a newspaper. She wrote that hands have their own handwriting and that if you place your palm on a table you will hear a story if you are patient and impolite. She wrote that letting go is a verb you learn with wrists first, not heart. She kept that paragraph not because it was good but because it was honest enough to be allowed in the room with her other better paragraphs without staring at them too long.\n\nIn bed she practiced not thinking about anything that had claws. She practiced not rehearsing arguments she would never have with strangers under online articles. She practiced wanting small things and then wanting nothing. She told herself out loud that she could be the kind of person who brought a tiger to the city and then took her out of it and still be allowed to have other sentences. Sleep came like a woman who had been kept waiting and decided to forgive her anyway for the sake of the next day, and the generator sang its minor key and then took a breath and held it, which in this city was a kind of lullaby.The morning after the rain, the city wore its damp like a new scarf it was not sure how to arrange, and Rima woke into a light that had sharpened edges and polite shadows. The window screens exhaled a fine cool and the apartment had the smell she privately called the smell of beginning again: metal a little cleaned by weather, lemons somewhere insisting on their usefulness, dust deciding to behave. She boiled water on the stove because the generator had chosen to rehearse indifference, and the kettle\u2019s thin scream braided with the radio from Salma\u2019s kitchen through the wall so that for a moment the two rooms decided to be one. She thought about the piece and its small ripples and about Mishmish tracing her uncomplicated path around an enclosure, and she let the fact that there was nothing dramatic to do today settle over her shoulders like a shawl she had learned to like by wearing it often.\n\nShe took the bus out of superstition rather than need, because buses were a way of asking a city to tell you what it thought of you without resorting to surveys. Men clung to the inside of the door as if it were a family tradition and a boy balanced a tray of coffees for a distance that felt like a miracle performed for free, and when they lurched towards the ring road a woman in blue sandals began to tell a stranger the exact recipe for keeping basil arrogant. Rima listened with the greed she reserved for other people\u2019s recipes and imagined the basil on her neighbor\u2019s balcony raising an eyebrow at the advice, then turned her attention to a billboard in which a woman with a powdered face sold a future that included better skin and, somehow, a passport. She wanted to be irritated and found instead that she was fond of the way the driver\u2019s rosary clicked against the plastic of the dashboard, a little percussion instrument insisting on its right to be part of the orchestra of this day.\n\nMaya had asked for a proposal that did not apologize for being a book, and Rima sat in a caf\u00e9 with tables that had been repainted so many times the wood was an anecdote under coats of ambition and looked at a blank document titled In Care Of. She wrote an opening paragraph and deleted it because it was writing like a person pretending to be someone who had written a first draft before, and then she wrote another that was worse and kept it out of spite. She watched the barista wipe the counter in circles that got bigger when the conversation with a friend got more interesting and felt a sudden panic that she was trying to invent a ladder to a roof she was not sure she wanted to be on. She drank her coffee, which did not try to be metaphorical, and began again with a sentence about the way time bends around acts of attention, and this time she did not delete it, not because it was good but because it pointed in a direction that made her body lean.\n\nShe met Hadi in the late afternoon under the jacaranda that had decided to drop purple without consulting anyone\u2019s schedule, and his face had a shine she recognized from boys who had learned to say no without apologizing for the electricity that followed. He told her he had two clients who had cried and one who had laughed and one who had simply looked at the floor and asked if he could be rude for an hour without consequence, and that he had stood the whole time because sitting would have made him patient and he wanted to be something else. He confessed that he had written an invoice and then rewritten it three times because the numbers looked like confessions he was not ready to make, and she told him to pick a number he would be embarrassed to say aloud and then divide it by two and then add a little for the future. They had the kind of argument that friends who trust each other have about money, which always ends with the air between them slightly cleaned and the sense that if they were in fact poor they were poor together in a way that made it less humiliating.\n\nThe inspector returned to the cinema at a time of day chosen to make statements feel bigger, his mustache trimmed down into a more aerodynamic opinion and a new folder under his arm that had learned to perform consequence. He stepped inside and stood in the square where the crate had lived as if waiting to be haunted, and when he realized the ghost would not show itself, he clicked his pen twice and looked at Rima the way teachers look at students who insist on being difficult on Fridays. He had brought forms after all, and he laid them on the plastic table like a deck of cards while informing her in a tone that attempted fatherhood that fines were possible, that permission had not been granted in advance, that the city wanted to be consulted even when it had no plan to help. Rima listened until listening became an act of politeness rather than civic duty, and then she said yes in the correct places and said mm in the places where agreement would be a lie pretended in the service of peace, and when he asked her what had been inside she told him the truth in the past tense and watched it become small immediately in his expression.\n\nThe graffiti reappeared in a different hand, one that wrote letters like ladders without rungs so that phrases looked like they had given up halfway to escape, and this time it read: TAKE YOUR SHOW ELSEWHERE. Rima stood and read it as if it were advice from a relative with an agenda and then went to buy paint and did not paint it because she did not want to erase the record of a city talking to itself in bad moods. Leila came with a paper bag of sesame biscuits and announced that she had quit her job for forty-five minutes and then taken it back and that she was experimenting with freedom in small doses like a person who has been fasting and understands that gluttony will make her sick. They sat on the threshold and ate and talked about leaving and staying and about another person they knew who had moved to Berlin and now pretended it was impossible to find parsley, and for a moment both of them were loyal to the idea of another place. The biscuits left a dust that felt like a blessing on their fingers, and a boy on a bicycle coasted past so beautifully upright they both applauded in their heads.\n\nSalma\u2019s neighbor began to lose names at the edges, the kind of forgetting that makes everyone suddenly experts at tenderness and at denial, and Rima found herself sitting in the woman\u2019s living room while Salma argued with a cousin on the phone about the difference between help and interference. The neighbor offered Rima a plate of pistachios and then forgot she had done so and then offered again, and the B-movie on the television looped a scene in which a man promised a woman he would become a better version of himself after the next commercial break. Rima thought about the way memory could be a country with borders that changed every night without announcing anything to the neighbors and wondered how many versions of her father remained in Salma\u2019s mind and which one was allowed to cook in the kitchen of their shared nostalgia. When they left, Salma kissed the neighbor\u2019s forehead and called her by her name because names were the last flags you surrender, and on the staircase she said aloud to no one in particular that the city should charge tax on worry because otherwise it had no revenue stream that made moral sense.\n\nUp at the sanctuary, Karim began to trust her a little in the specific way that men who live with animals trust women who do not insist on being looked at while they are being useful, and he let her carry buckets without monitoring the angle of her elbows. The goats had learned to ignore new humans unless those humans tried to be goats, and the monkeys had learned a routine of mischief that involved the theft of exactly one glove every afternoon as a demonstration of their commitment to humor. Mishmish was larger than she had been in Rima\u2019s mind, which made Rima think of how certain friendships improve when they are allowed to grow beyond the size of the story that started them, and when the animal lay in a patch of sun she did it with the authority of a creature that has decided to impress nobody. Karim spoke with his hand on a fencepost as if that made the words less arrogant coming out, and he told her that an animal does not become a lesson unless you insist on it, and that the best days are the days when nothing is learned and everything is done.\n\nNoura had an argument with a ministry that pretended to be a person in a suit and ended the phone call with a sentence that could have been used as a knife if she had wanted to cut anything, and then she laughed with her whole face in a way that made Rima want to like all bureaucrats who did not deserve it. The road back down from the sanctuary had softened with the rain and insisted on making the truck perform intimacy with the earth, and a boy carrying a basket of figs that were more bruise than fruit offered them one each with the generosity of a person who had decided to be rich when he had a handful of sweetness. They drove with the windows down so they could carry the smell of the hillside into the city and smear it across the concrete like a charm that would not work, and when they passed the billboard with the new watch promising to stop time Rima yelled at it, gently, to mind its business. The sea took their voices and did not bother to give them back, which felt like relief.\n\nHadi asked her to attend one of his group sessions because he had discovered that when men sat in a circle they either said nothing or everything and he needed a woman who could be a chair that asked questions without being sat on. She sat with four men who had learned their own names in different countries and listened to a man who had once been called a genius in a room with glass walls confess that he had begun to hate his own adjectives, and to another who admitted that he sometimes wandered the supermarket for the comfort of fluorescent certainty. Hadi kept time without looking at his watch because he had learned the length of other people\u2019s courage in minutes, and when one of the men said that he was tired of his jokes not being funny anymore Rima said gently that perhaps they had done their work and could be put to bed. The hour stretched and then snapped back, and as they stood to leave she watched one of them fold his anger into a pocket like a handkerchief he might need later and decided she liked this quiet work even though it made her skin feel too thin for a while.\n\nThe landlord\u2019s sister moved in on the third floor and rearranged the hallway with rugs that smelled like storage, and her boy left sneaker marks on the staircase in patterns that suggested dance and impatience. She greeted Rima as if they had once shared a table at a funeral and asked immediately what exactly it was Rima did for a living and whether it made steady money, and when Rima said writer the woman made the face people make when told about a medical condition they do not believe is real. Abu Fadi watched from his doorway with an expression that combined pride and dread and later told Rima in the tone of a man confessing a small sin that his sister had been sent back to him by a husband who needed space, and that she would bring many plants and many rules and that everyone should prepare themselves. He then handed Rima a small bag of nails and asked her to fix the hinge to a cupboard because the carpenter had become allergic to his own promises and needed to be punished by being replaced with neighbors.\n\nShe and Leila went swimming in Batroun one evening because their bodies demanded salt like a song and the road had given them an hour in which to pretend they were women who could decide such things. The sea held them without asking for names and handed them back to the shore gently, and they lay on their towels with wet hair like children after a long day of pretending to be dragons. They talked about leaving again and about staying again and about how staying could be a plan and not a failure if you dressed it right, and when the sky put on its apricot they said the word Mishmish at the same time and then did not talk for a whole minute, which for them was a rare and expensive silence. A group of teenagers practiced sorrow by kicking a ball and missing on purpose so they could groan and then laugh, and Leila told Rima that she had made a list of ten things that would make her life 7 percent better and that she was on number three, which was buying a trash can she did not despise.\n\nThe proposal grew in layers like a cake for a person who despises icing, and Rima began to enjoy the feeling of building something that did not need to be shared yet, which she realized was a new pleasure for her in this century of public drafts. She wrote about the difference between sponsorship and care with fewer metaphors and more nouns, and she placed the chapter about Mishmish not at the beginning like a surprise she needed to spoil for herself but closer to the middle, where the weight could be carried by other stories that had none of the glamour of teeth. She investigated her father with restraint and decided that when she wrote about him she would put the best version of him in the kitchen and the worst on the balcony, which felt fair because balconies had always been where her family confessed its foolishness to the open air. When she sent ten pages to Maya, she cried in the bathroom before reading the notes not because she expected cruelty but because kindness had begun to be a thing that frightened her when it arrived on time.\n\nGhida asked about her sleep and Rima lied to see if she would be caught and then laughed at herself because lying to a woman you pay to hear you tell the truth felt like buying fruit and complaining about sweetness. The room where they sat had a plant that looked like it had been rescued from someone who overwatered it, and Rima stared at its leaves while she tried to describe what it meant to be watched by a city and also to be ignored by it, and how both could be a kind of hunger with different symptoms. Ghida said she was not interested in sentences that sounded like awards and asked her what she had wanted to do a week ago but had not, and Rima said that she had wanted to take the bus to her father\u2019s grave and talk to the grass and had not because she had been embarrassed of her own theater. Ghida asked what was theatrical about talking to grass when grass minded its own business as a rule, and Rima admitted that she was not embarrassed for the grass but for the part of her that would try to narrate the meeting as if she were a magazine.\n\nThere was a small fire in a building down the street that was extinguished by neighbors with buckets and one man with a hose who did not turn the water off at the tap afterwards, and the result was a river down the stairs that carried cigarette butts and one slipper to the sidewalk where it laid them out like evidence. Rima watched from her window with the fascinated helplessness of a person who had not been chosen by crisis and felt the cheapness of that relief, and she went down to help carry a couch after the smoke had decided it had made its point. An old woman whose voice had never learned to be quiet thanked everyone loudly and declared the fire a cousin to all the other problems, and then asked if anyone had a fan to lend because her room had become the inside of a boiled potato. The street organized itself the way certain families do when death is visiting someone else and decided who would cook and who would clean and who would be allowed to sit with the woman and talk about God without pointing too directly at Him.\n\nA letter arrived in the mail three weeks late and looked like it had fought a small war with a puddle and lost, and inside it was a note from the cousin of the owner of the old cinema asking in a tone of injured magnanimity whether she would be willing to pay a little more for the space now that it had acquired fame. The cousin had included a smiling photograph of himself holding a plate of grilled fish as if to prove that he was a man with appetites and not just a signature, and Rima took the letter to Abu Fadi like a child taking a misbehaving pet to a neighbor who had a way with animals. The landlord read it with the full attention of his eyebrows and then said he would handle it in a way that made Rima briefly love hierarchy, and he called the cousin and told him that if he had wanted more money he should have raised the rent before allowing his building to become a saint. When he hung up, he told Rima that he had saved her three meetings and two insults and that she owed him a tray of knafeh, and for once she did not argue with the economy of that exchange.\n\nHadi\u2019s father appeared one evening with a plastic bag full of oranges that had been discouraged by their tree and asked if the building had a view of the harbor from a window he could stand at for a minute. He had a voice like cardboard softened by rain and eyes that had chosen to forgive more than they should have, and he stood at the window and watched nothing in particular and said only, it looks the same as twelve years ago and then it looks different, which is how time behaves when it wants to show off. He sat and drank tea with too much sugar and told her that Hadi had been the kind of boy who picked up nails from the road as if the road needed to be protected from itself, and that he was glad his son had found a way to ask men for money by giving them something that was not a lie. Before he left, he pressed a coin into her palm as if she were a child, and she put it in the bowl where she kept lost screws and spare buttons and the gold tooth of a story she had never written.\n\nAutumn entered like a woman who has always had a key even if nobody remembered giving it to her, and the air did that trick of moving across skin as if it were reading. The city adjusted its noises downward by a half-step and soups began to be spoken of with more respect and shirts decided to be sleeves again. Rima found that her nights were less aggressive and that sleep visited without needing to be negotiated with like a poorly behaved guest, and she began to dream in longer sentences that did not require her to wake and write them down to be believed later. She went to the club twice in a week and did not apologize to herself, and she stood over a ball and swung without demanding any lesson from it, and when it landed where it should she felt the particular satisfaction of being competent at something that did not matter beyond the minutes in which it was being done.\n\nThe panel she had refused happened without her and then happened with her when Maya, who knew her better than she would admit, texted to say that one of the speakers had misunderstood the difference between metaphor and fact and could she please come and be impolite in an educated way. She stood on stage in shoes that did not pinch and said what she had promised herself she would say if ever given a microphone again, which was that animals were not reputations and that stories could be useful if they were built to be used rather than admired. A man asked a question that was really a speech and she answered with a question that was really a refusal, and the audience murmured the way audiences do when they are grateful to be watching someone else argue about a thing they feel strongly about. Afterward, a woman with a notebook asked her if she was afraid and Rima said yes in the voice of a person ordering bread, and the woman wrote the yes down as if it had been a more complicated word.\n\nThe boy with the camera brought her a copy of his photo printed on cheap paper that made the blacks into slowly surrendering grays, and he told her he had written his sentence on the back and then decided not to because he wanted the picture to be a place where people could be honest without being told what to think. He had been offered a small job at a wedding where the groom wanted to look surprised at being loved and the bride wanted to look like a person who had invented forgiveness, and he had said yes because money had become a muscle he wanted to train. He asked her how to invoice and she gave him Hadi\u2019s sentence and told him to double it because weddings are expensive. He laughed in the untidy way of boys who have not learned to hide delight, and then he asked if the tiger remembered her and she said that what mattered was that the tiger remembered trees.\n\nOne evening near the end of the month, Salma called with the particular structure of breath that told Rima she had been about to say something else and changed her mind, and she asked if Rima would come to watch a television serial with her because she had realized she did not want to be alone when the sister betrayed the sister again. Rima went with bread and an onion and a cheap bottle of red that had won prizes in a week when prizes were being generous, and they sat shoulder to shoulder on the couch and argued in whispers about the motives of people who did not exist. During the commercial breaks, Salma told stories about her own sister that she had not told before because they had been stored in a drawer marked too big, and Rima realized with the gentle shock that sometimes accompanied her mother\u2019s sentences that grief had made her mother kinder in a way no lecture could have taught. When she left, Salma pressed a bag of thyme into her hand and told her to eat stupidly in the morning and to try not to educate every hunger before satisfying it.\n\nMishmish appeared in her dreams sometimes now only as a temperature, a square of sun that moved over a floor and a sound of breath that straightened Rima\u2019s back even when she was not aware of slouching. In one dream, the tiger lay under an olive tree and the tree told her a joke about men who insist on holding umbrellas for you in rain that is not falling, and Rima laughed in her sleep and woke with her mouth open and her throat unafraid. She began to learn the names of the volunteers not because names were important for their own sake but because she liked the way men and women said their names when asked by a person who planned to remember, and she liked the way Karim said good when a bucket landed where it should and bad when it did not and nothing at all when the moment needed quiet. She tired of talking about the piece and learned to redirect the conversation toward the weather and the price of parsley and the rumor of a storm like a woman practiced in a polite martial art.\n\nThere were small humiliations and small glories and an afternoon when she found a note in her mailbox that said simply THANK YOU in a hand that was learning to grow up and a morning when she went to the pharmacy and was corrected by a girl ten years younger than her for mispronouncing the name of a cream. There was a day when the electricity did not come back when it said it would and she read by a window with her knees cold and there was a day when her upstairs neighbor practiced the oud for two hours and she forgave him for every missed note because the attempt filled a hole in the air that had been bothering her. There was a night when she took the long way home because there is a time in every life when one must take a street one has been avoiding and nothing happened and later she congratulated herself for swimming without water. She practiced wanting less attention and more endurance, which in her mouth felt like a reasonable prayer.\n\nThe city sent her a notice that she had been assigned a number for something she did not understand and she went to a building with chairs that had known the weight of five hundred kinds of impatience, and she waited with people who were both more important and less in a hierarchy that had nothing to do with the good. A woman with a child asleep on her lap told her a joke about stamps and they laughed as if stamps could hear and be shamed into good behavior, and when her number arrived on the screen in a red that demanded performance she walked to the window and was told that the system was down as if the system were a horse that had decided to sit. She went home and wrote a page about systems and horses and decided to cut it later, and then did not cut it because it lent a paragraph the spine that it had been pretending to grow.\n\nOn a Sunday that smelled like old bread being turned into something better, she took the bus to the edge of the city and walked the last kilometer along a road that held the ruins of cinemas and the new birth of small restaurants with chairs that would break within a year. She entered a building that had been a school before it was a clinic and listened to a woman explain how to volunteer with children who had learned to be louder than their parents to get noticed, and she wrote her name on a paper and felt the thrill of committing to a thing that might be boring. The woman smiled in a way that suggested relief that someone still believed paperwork could transform time into service, and handed her a schedule that made sense to her mouth. On the bus back she sat next to a boy eating chips with diligence and a man reading a book as if it had betrayed him and she rested her head against the window and let the city find its way back into her bones as if there had ever been a time it had not lived there.\n\nAt night, the generator hit its middle C and held it as if trying to calm a child, and she wrote a paragraph about care that did not attempt to be pretty and could therefore be trusted. She wrote about the small ways people make each other less lonely in this place without turning it into a parade, and she wrote about the ugliness that sometimes arrives when people decide to be necessary. She wrote about holding and releasing, about doorways and thresholds and rituals that do not ask permission from any flag, and she wrote down the sentence Salma had thrown across the kitchen like a braid: be offended and alive. She slept with the window open and let the city\u2019s breath lift the edge of her curtain, and when the dawn\u2019s first scooter cut through the street she was grateful like a woman who had survived a test she had not studied for and decided to forgive herself for the questions she had answered poorly.The heat retreated for a week as if it had remembered an appointment elsewhere, and in the pause the city revealed small things that July had kept hidden under its sweaty palm. The mountains began to admit out loud that they were green under the dust, and the sea had the uncomplicated confidence of a dog off its leash. Rima walked differently when the air loosened, not because relief should change your spine, but because it does. She took her mother\u2019s advice as if it were a vitamin she could dissolve under her tongue, and applied for the volunteer shift at the clinic, filling out a paper that had questions her body knew how to answer before her brain did. When she wrote her name in the square provided, she wrote it with the clean discipline of someone who had stopped wanting to see it everywhere.\n\nThe first day at the clinic, the room was a box painted a cheerful color that had known sadness and refused to let it be private. Tables had been pushed together to make islands, and pencils rolled off the edges and into hands that were used to catching things that tried to fall. The woman in charge was called Rasha and had a voice like a jacket that fit most people, and she introduced Rima as if she were a spoon, useful and ordinary and necessary. Twenty minutes later, six children held markers like weapons and declared that they would draw only monsters or only houses or only birds that had forgotten how to be afraid of people. Rima let them do it and did not tell them that tigers existed, because their monsters were complicated enough, and because she had promised herself that she would not feed her story to anyone who had not asked for a second serving.\n\nA girl named Mira\u2014who had a hairclip bitten into the shape of a star and a habit of measuring everything by the distance between her eyebrows and the person speaking\u2014drew a cat with teeth like triangles from a math book and then told Rima that the cat loved lemons. Another boy, Ayman, made a city out of squares and then colored the sky black because he had been reprimanded by a cousin for using blue on a Thursday once and had decided never to do it again. Rima asked them what they wanted to name a street and they named it after a teacher, and after a soccer player, and after a grandmother who had once stopped a car with her hand because it had offended her crossing. When they wrote small sentences under their drawings, Rima tried not to make suggestions that would turn those sentences into versions of herself, and she failed once or twice and recovered by keeping her mouth busy with agreeing noises instead of edits.\n\nOn the walk home, she passed a door that had been painted with flowers by a hand that had never seen a flower and still managed to get the insistence correct. A man sitting on a chair that belonged to the street asked if the clinic paid in cash or in gratitude and whether he could apply if it was the second, and she told him to try and he saluted her with an orange soda. She realized that for the first time in weeks she was not walking toward the cinema or away from it, and the relief had in it the faintest sting, because the room without the crate had become a map pinned to her ribs. She went anyway, because absence is a sculpture you should not leave in the dark too long, and stood where the square of pacing had gradually faded into the general rumor of concrete, and let that mild grief have a minute.\n\nHadi called to ask if she could sit in on a session where a man who had learned generosity in public and cruelty in private wanted to practice dull kindness. The request was specific in a way that made her respect him more than she had the day before, because good work has names for its parts. The men arrived in the wrong order and sat in chairs that had not been designed for the bodies they brought into the room, and Hadi stood with his hands in front of him as if carrying an invisible bowl that needed to be kept level. The man with the dimples who made women forgive him before he had asked them to spoke first and said he was exhausted by his own talent for escape, and the one who was built like a cupboard and had learned to store emotion rather than display it said he had begun to hate Thursday nights because there was too much expectation piled on top of a beer. Rima watched Hadi do the work of refusing to be their savior and instead be their calendar, and it made something behind her sternum stretch pleasantly and then warn her not to be simple.\n\nAfter the session a man lingered and told Rima a story about his mother making cheese by boiling milk until it became reason, and confessed that when she died he began to eat plastic-wrapped slices because grief had taught him to reject effort. Hadi walked her out and they leaned against a wall that had collected twenty years of conversations and agreed that men were children and women were children and everyone was a child and that judging that fact was less useful than planning nap times. He asked if she had written the paragraph about hands he had been waiting to read and when she said yes he kissed the top of her head without warning in the way a brother does when he remembers to be tender. She shoved him away gently and they grinned at their own competence at not complicating the moment, and then both of them fell quiet because the temptation had been there and naming it felt like letting a door blow shut.\n\nThe tiger became a rumor in the city\u2019s mouth rather than a headline, and Rima was grateful for the demotion. The iron door acquired new messages\u2014someone had drawn a fish large enough to swallow the word predator, and someone else had written a phone number and the words I CAN FIX ANY FAN, and below it a third person had added IF YOU CAN FIX MY MOTHER-IN-LAW YOU ARE A GENIUS. She took a photograph of the door because her memory had begun to misbehave in small ways and she wanted proof that cities are jokes told by committees, and she sent the photograph to Maya because editors can be rehabilitated into friends if everyone is careful. Maya sent back a sentence about doors being mouths and Rima rolled her eyes fondly and saved it for later theft.\n\nKarim called at an hour the hills consider private and asked in his straightforward voice if she could come up on Friday without asking questions on the phone. She said yes because people who manage animals with their hands seldom dramatize logistics unnecessarily, and because yes was the kind of obedience she had learned to enjoy in this context. On the road north, the air decided to be clean enough for her to smell what the factories contributed, and she found herself angry and fond in the same breath, which is to say she was loyal to the place. At the sanctuary, the light slipped between leaves the way a phrase slips between friends at a table without needing to make sense to everyone, and Karim met her at the gate with an expression that carried both pride and a request to be told he was wrong if he was wrong.\n\nMishmish had an abrasion on her shoulder that looked worse than it was, the result of a quarrel with a branch that had stood its ground. Karim had decided to encourage the animal to present it voluntarily to a hand and had a plan that involved patience and tuna and the careful management of who watched whom. He asked Rima not to speak for an hour, which was an insult she accepted gladly, and showed her where to stand so that the tiger could see her without feeling seen. The animal approached in arcs that would have embarrassed geometry teachers, and each time Karim did nothing until doing something would not be a betrayal. When the head came close enough that Rima could see the particular constellation of whisker-spots that had become her favorite proof of existence, she remembered the corridor and the iron door and the water made into bricks of ice, and she felt at the same time the arrogance of her old wanting and the sobriety of this new arrangement where her wanting had to be smaller than the animal\u2019s comfort. The tuna did its loyal work, which is to say it made everything easier without pretending to be holy, and Karim laid a hand briefly, a touch so light that it was barely an admission, and Rima did not cry because the economy of that contact forbade squandered reactions.\n\nOn the drive back she stopped at a roadside stand where figs were being lied about and could not decide which lie she preferred\u2014Rashaya or Tyre\u2014and bought both, which is a decision money will let you pretend is principled. The man selling them had the eyes of someone who had forgiven two sons and a brother and was now bored, and he asked if she had ever considered opening a shop because her face looked like it would do well with customers. She told him she had opened a whole building once and it had not gone well, and he told her he had once opened a marriage and it had done fine until it needed servicing, and the tone of the exchange made her laugh, which made him give her an extra two figs because men like to be rewarded for humor they did not plan.\n\nSalma\u2019s health made a small joke and then apologized for it. She fainted in the supermarket by the aisle with the olive oil and fell against a display of biscuits that scattered themselves like money, and when she came to she had one soft cookie in her hand and the certainty that the body can embarrass you in public and keep your dignity anyway. Rima met her at the clinic and watched a nurse half her age take her mother\u2019s blood pressure with the kind of seriousness that prevented Rima from making any jokes, and when a young doctor with a haircut that had been chosen by a mother said fulminations of dehydration, they nodded as if he had described a minor character in a soap opera. The bureaucracy wrapped them in its slow embrace and asked them to sit and then to stand and then to sit again from a different direction, and Rima filled a form for her mother because Salma had refused to wear her glasses because they were ugly, and she found that writing her mother\u2019s date of birth on a paper she would not keep made her feel strangely proprietary about the way time passed through that body.\n\nThey bought the prescribed water and salt and sugar as if they were ingredients for a dessert and took a taxi home because sometimes taxis were better than the bus when the day had already taken more than its fair share and you were in no mood to measure yourself against the city's arithmetic. In the kitchen, lemon halves sat like witnesses again while Salma insisted on making a dish that required more attention than a body should give after falling, and Rima did not argue because the hierarchy here was ancient and the stove could be its altar. When Salma sat down finally, she told a story about a cousin who had fainted in a wedding dress and been so grateful for the excuse to sit that she had fallen again in the same place the next day, and they laughed not because they were cruel but because the story had been told to them at exactly the right time.\n\nThe boy with the camera appeared at the cinema wearing a shirt that had been ironed so enthusiastically it had become a different shirt, and told Rima that he had been offered an internship at a paper that pretended to be more important than it was and that he might take it because he had discovered that being poor was wasting his good angles. He asked if he could write about the tiger without telling people where she was and whether he should mention her name and whether if he did his mother would stop thinking he was unserious, and Rima told him that he could write about the thing he had seen as long as he did not use it as a mirror for his feelings unless he did it better than most people did. He promised to try and she believed him because believing boys when they promised to try was a muscle she exercised carefully but regularly, and she told him that if the paper edited his piece until it became a stranger he should print it himself on bad paper and hang it in his kitchen and make people read it before he allowed them to sit.\n\nThe landlord\u2019s sister began to put rugs in the corridor and rules on the door and told Rima that slippers were required because bare feet carried gossip into private spaces. She arranged six plants like a congregation and watered them with a measuring cup in a way that made Rima fear for their will to live, and when Rima suggested that plants preferred neglect to suffocation the woman made a face that suggested she doubted experts and had a PhD in household convictions. Abu Fadi watched the two of them with the glee of a man watching two cats negotiate a map and warned his sister, in the voice of a man who had learned not to step directly into the road unless prepared to be run over, that Rima\u2019s rules were already written on the wall of the city. In the end, they negotiated a ceasefire where the plants would be allowed and the slippers suggested and the corridor would be swept every other day by anyone who found it dirty first, which in practice meant Rima most mornings because she woke earlier than most people in the building and hated stepping over crumbs.\n\nMaya asked her to write a column that would exist once a month and not apologize to itself for starting fresh each time, and Rima asked for permission to sometimes write about nothing and was surprised when the answer was yes. She wrote the first about ironing, and about the way heat and pressure\u2014applied to cloth or to a story\u2014could be either an act of care or of cruelty depending on the wrist. She confessed that she did not iron and would always rather hang something near a window and let the weather and time collaborate, and then she wrote a sentence about her father ironing his shirts while watching soccer with the sound off because commentary is a form of invasion, and she kept the sentence when she had the urge to cut it because cutting would have been an act of cowardice disguised as perfectionism. The column landed quietly like a plate in a kitchen that is already loud, and three women wrote to tell her that they ironed only when their mothers visited, and one man wrote to say that he ironed everything because his mother had not visited in twenty years.\n\nGhida, whose room had begun to feel like a country with rules you could respect without having to pledge allegiance to anything, asked Rima what she had wanted to say to her father for a decade and had not, and when Rima said she wanted to ask him if he had loved exactly one person in his life fiercely and whether that person had been a woman or a version of himself that had played tennis, Ghida nodded as if the ridiculousness of the question was not an offense but a requirement. Rima went to the graveyard on a morning that smelled like rain had insulted a rock and placed a bottle of water near the stone because she could not bear to come empty-handed, and she spoke aloud knowing that stones do not answer but they do witness. She told upturned dust that she had done a ridiculous thing and returned it to its proper place, and that she had learned that proper places are sentences that need to be negotiated constantly, and she thanked a man who could not hear for the three rules he had given her: do not look at the ball, do not look at yourself, swing. Then she sat on a low wall and refused to narrate her own sincerity because some scenes die under the weight of language.\n\nA storm threatened and then decided it preferred the next valley and left the city with fast clouds and a mood. The second checkpoint acquired a new soldier who was not good at his job in the way that made him kind because he did not know yet where he was supposed to be cruel. Noura lost a battle with a map and won something more important with a phone call that made three men bend in three offices, and she sent Rima a photograph of a tortoise who had decided to be a philosopher and a monkey who had decided to be a thief of pens. Karim sent a message that simply read rain came and we found out where the roof was lying about itself, and Rima sent back a promise of money because promises are how people who are not physically present pretend to be helpful. She went to see Uncle Sami at the ice place because loyalty is a map too, and bought a small bag of ice even though the weather did not require it, and listened to him talk about a niece who had taken a job in a country where people did not shout and had written home that the quiet hurt her ears.\n\nAt the clinic, Ayman apologized to his Thursday rules and used blue for sky and then felt guilty and asked Rima if he had betrayed his cousin. She told him that color was not the kind of fidelity anyone should be testing, and he thought about it and drew a bicycle with the perspective all wrong and told her the man who sold the bicycle refused to believe that the boy buying it had not stolen the money, and she asked him to write that down and he did in letters that were all elbows. Mira decided that the lemon-cat deserved a friend and drew a bird with teeth and wrote under it that it only ate seeds because teeth were a decoration and not a plan, and Rima told her she should get paid for the sentence one day. When she walked from the clinic to the bus, she saw three men unsuccessfully pretending not to like the rain and one woman successfully pretending not to like the rain, and she took a picture of the pavement because the tiny puddles had become her favorite city\u2014clear, bordered, temporary.\n\nHadi and she made a new practice of swimming very early when the beach was half-empty and the lifeguards were bleary-eyed and kind. They did not talk much in the water because breath has better uses there, and when they sat after in the warm with coffee he told her that his father had begun to make jokes again and he did not know if this meant he was healing or cowering. She told him that laughter could be both a rock and a river, and he told her that sentence was ugly and probably true, and that Ghida had asked him to try not laughing for an hour in his next session and he was terrified of discovering that everything he said without laughter was a complaint. They planned a small celebration for his first five paying clients and decided to call it a lunch and not a ceremony because men deserve to be fed rather than applauded, and because Lebanon had spent too much applause on the wrong afternoons.\n\nThe cousin of the cinema owner persisted with his letters, and in one he included an invoice for air that had been, in his opinion, consumed excessively by Rima and her fans. Abu Fadi responded by installing a small sign in the lobby that read AIR FREE TODAY ONLY and took a photograph of it and sent it to the cousin and to Rima with a string of laughing emojis that looked like pills. Rima printed the photograph and taped it above her desk to remind herself to be stupid in public occasionally, and she wrote a paragraph that began with the absurdity and ended with a serious thought about the commons. Maya told her to move it from the beginning to the sixth paragraph and to stop hiding her thesis in jokes and to risk earnestness earlier, and Rima sulked for an hour and then did it and the piece grew bones where previously there had been cartilage.\n\nIn the sanctuary, a hyena arrived with eyes like long questions and a history that had to be discovered backwards. Karim showed Rima how an animal names its square by stepping into it with the same foot first, and how patience is a verb with teeth, and how even the laziest afternoon can require the full strength of two hands if you are doing it right. She watched him teach a young volunteer how to hold a bucket as if it were fragile when it was made of plastic and then explain that everything should be handled that way, not because it might break but because it might resist being used. When she told him he sounded like a book he said he had never liked books because they stayed where you left them, and she told him that some of them moved at night and he made the particular face men make when forced to admit they have been charmed against their will.\n\nThe boy with the camera wrote his piece and it appeared in a column that had once mattered and still pretended to, and it was good enough to make Rima jealous and respectful in equal measure. He did not mention names and he did not claim knowledge he did not possess, and he stopped the piece at exactly the right place and did not add a sentimental sentence about hope, which made her want to buy him a pair of shoes. He came to see her with the paper folded to his paragraph and a look on his face like a person who has found a coin on the ground that turned out to be gold-plated, and she told him to keep the clipping in a book and not on his wall so that only thieves of books would steal it. He said the editor had asked him to find a second animal and he had said no, and she told him he had saved himself three bad years with that one small refusal.\n\nSalma\u2019s neighbor\u2019s forgetting began to invite strangers into their hallway in the form of cousins with opinions, and Rima practiced the art of smiling at people whose presence made the apartment smaller. She learned to avoid the hours when the kitchen became a parliament and instead brought food at times when chewing would interrupt debate, and she learned that three people could get through an awkward afternoon by shelling peas, and she learned that if you sing three lines badly and then repeat them you can put a sorrow to sleep temporarily. Salma herself rediscovered flirting with life, which is to say she bought new curtains with flowers that were too big and scolded them for being showy and hung them anyway, and she informed Rima that she would not attend any event where people clapped for her daughter because clapping made her nervous, but that she would stand near the door and take in the air like a participant.\n\nThe city\u2019s light shifted into its autumn shape and the evenings became a way of forgiving the day for what it had done. The Corniche filled with men who declared that cold had arrived while being wrong and with women who refused to bring sweaters out of principle, and the fishermen pretended not to notice tourists pretending to know anything about fish. The iron door acquired a new piece of graffiti in a tender hand that read WE ARE TIRED OF BEING BRAVE TRY BEING SAFE FOR A WEEK, and Rima did not paint over it because it sounded like a prayer a person who had run out of the proper ones might try. She traced the curve of the S with her thumb as if it would fix something, and then she went upstairs and wrote about a day when safety had been an unremarkable noun, and she sent it to Maya and Maya wrote back that the unremarkable is the only revolution she believed in this year.\n\nWhen the storm finally came, it came with a stance, shoulders square, hands open, as if ready to argue anyone out of their sunshine. Trees popped with the sound of equalities asserted and then broken, and the street briefly became a river where cigarette butts swam bravely before drowning. The ceiling of the back room at the cinema revealed a line of betrayal, and Rima arranged bowls under it as if placing instruments in an orchestra and listened to their different pitches with a satisfaction that felt inappropriate but was not, because the music meant she could act. She called the number under I CAN FIX ANY FAN and a man arrived with a toolbox and a temper and looked at the leak like a personal insult, and he climbed a ladder with the grace of an old acrobat and made it stop long enough for the storm to forget to insist.\n\nAfter the storm, the city did what it always did after deciding to live through another indignity: it dried its hair in the sun and pretended it had never been bothered. The clinic was full of children who had discovered puddles and learned to jump without the permission of any adult, and Rasha had to pretend to scold them because the floor had become a map of wet footprints that would turn into a hazard if not admired briefly and then removed. Mira drew a bird that had decided to wear a raincoat and gave it a name too long to fit under the picture, and Ayman tried to describe thunder without using the word thunder and failed beautifully. Rima took their pages home and put them in a folder marked Stories That Do Not Ask For Me, and she felt the sweetness of keeping things that did not need her to make sense.\n\nHadi\u2019s group learned to sit without filling silences with weather, and a man who had never spoken about his divorce because his preferred story about himself did not include any acts of being left said slowly that he had been told to be strong and had decided to be useful instead, and that this had ended badly for everyone. They sat with that until the clock demanded they pay attention to it instead, and after the session Hadi and Rima ate shawarma standing up because stools are timid furniture and some decisions are best made while leaning. He told her that he had turned down a client who wanted him to help with a speech to impress investors because he had asked what the man wanted out of life and the man had said applause, and Rima put her hand on the back of his neck briefly because it was a part of the body that respects small encouragements, and then she removed it because the air between them was theirs and she did not want to spend it improperly.\n\nNight returned to being evidence rather than a threat, and Rima found that she could read after nine without her mind staging a small refusal. She opened a book of letters between two women who had died before Lebanon taught her to count time in outages and admired the way they were unashamed of loving each other\u2019s sentences. She made tea that tasted like a compromise between mint and the idea of mint, and she wrote a paragraph about repair that did not try to be larger than the objects it described. She thought briefly of the tiger and then did not, which felt like progress and also like disloyalty, and she allowed herself to believe that both could be true and she could be permitted to sleep.\n\nThe next morning, she woke to the smell of bread that was not her own and realized that the landlord\u2019s sister had baked manakish in a pan that had seen battle and was now a veteran, and the woman had placed one at Rima\u2019s door with a note that read SORRY FOR THE RUGS I WILL REDUCE THEM BY ONE. Rima took the bread and warmed it and ate it with her fingers because food wants to be touched, and she stood at the threshold chewing and thinking that the world would be easier if every apology arrived with thyme. She went back to her desk, opened the document titled In Care Of, and wrote, for the first time without hesitation, a page that began not with a tiger or with a mother or with a man who had learned to be a different kind of useful, but with a towel hung carefully on a chair to dry in a room where a leak had been persuaded to pause. She wrote until the generator decided to flirt with her anger again, and then she wrote a little more in the dark because stubbornness can be as holy as a plan when you are honest about it.",

                              "content": "The day Rima decided to adopt a tiger, the generator coughed and the lights blinked, and Beirut wore its usual necklace of noise. Hum of scooters and traffic, the salt breath of the sea blowing in and then out like a tired chest. A group of boys chased a deflated football down the Corniche while an older man watched the horizon for a ship that would not come. It was the kind of day that dared you to feel exceptional. So she did.\n\n\u201cYalla,\u201d she murmured into her coffee mug, as if speaking to the espresso. \u201cLet\u2019s do something unforgivable.\u201d\n\nShe had slept two hours and then drifted awake to the argument of pigeons on the windowsill. There had been emails, an assignment that paid too little, a blank document with the title TIGER, then a blinking cursor that made her feel judged. She had a joke she told herself: if she could not write herself into a new life, she would adopt one. A life with claws. A life that could not be ignored.\n\nShe knew it was insane. It was also a clean kind of insane, the kind that glowed with a mythic light in her head. Rima Haddad, thirty-four, from the place of fatherless daughters and lemon trees planted on balconies in plastic buckets, would bring a tiger to Beirut like a rumor. People would talk, in the way they did. She would write a book about it. She would become the sort of name that did not tremble when read aloud.\n\nOn the morning she made the decision, her mother called to ask why she had posted no photo of herself for a month.\n\n\u201cAre you sick?\u201d Salma asked. \u201cOr just stubborn?\u201d\n\n\u201cStubborn,\u201d Rima said. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cCooking. What else? I heard you haven\u2019t gone to the club in weeks.\u201d\n\nSalma always called the golf course the club, though she had never set foot there. In her mouth, it sounded more glamorous than it was. Rima had drifted into golf two summers prior because a profile piece on Lebanon\u2019s oldest course had led to a handful of free lessons, which led to the odd comfort of grass cut at mad precision and men in white shoes uttering soft curses over bad swings. She went not for the game but for the feeling of walking a quiet green in a noisy city, and because she liked Hadi, the caddy who never seemed to belong to the men he followed. He had a face like a clean sheet of paper and a habit of looking at her as if she were spelling things wrong.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d she told her mother now, lying as she crossed her toes. \u201cMaybe this week.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou used to send me photos from the bench under the big tree. Your hair was nice there. Put something nice.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe something wild.\u201d\n\n\u201cYa Rima. Be careful with your wild.\u201d\n\nIt took four phone calls and three almosts to find a way to make it happen. You\u2019d think there would be no door that opened onto a tiger, and maybe there wasn\u2019t, not in any official sense. But there was a message from a friend of a friend, a photograph that looked like a dream a child might have after eating too many apricots: the tiger curled into a crate like a painted boat, eyes too bright for the dull wood. The story was so ridiculous she did not question it\u2014smugglers had been caught, the animal was in limbo, a sanctuary in the Bekaa was full and the paperwork was water-marked with slowness. An acquaintance with a soft spot for disasters whispered there was a way to \u201csponsor\u201d the animal, to keep it nearby but not quite home. The word sponsor was like a lace thrown over something indecent.\n\n\u201cNot a pet,\u201d the acquaintance warned. \u201cYou can\u2019t put a leash on a wave.\u201d\n\n\u201cI write,\u201d Rima said. \u201cI don\u2019t leash.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the compromise was a building\u2014half abandoned, half music studio, a place where notes once clung to the damp walls, a cinema before the war and then not. The owner had fled to Montreal. The cousin of the owner wanted dollars, didn\u2019t care how. There was a back room not much larger than a shipping container with a high grate open to air and the scent of old cigarettes clinging to the paint. The street outside was one of those Gemmayzeh streets where you couldn\u2019t throw a rock without hitting a dream that had caught in someone\u2019s throat.\n\nShe went to see it with Leila, her neighbor with bangs cut crooked and a way of asking too many questions in a row.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not really doing this,\u201d Leila said, sliding past the iron door as if the building might bite.\n\n\u201cI am. Please don\u2019t send your brother to stop me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to send him.\u201d Leila paused. \u201cI was going to send your mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s worse.\u201d\n\nThe room smelled like damp and old peelings of paint. Rima ran a finger along the wall and came away with dust like flour. She could, theoretically, make a tiger\u2019s life here less terrible than in a crate. She could make it clean, at least, and quiet at the corners. She could bring in meat and ice and silence. She could sit and read aloud paragraphs that refused to behave.\n\n\u201cWhat will you name it?\u201d Leila asked.\n\n\u201cIt names itself,\u201d Rima said, trying to sound like a person who knew how to speak about enormous animals. The truth: she liked the idea of a tiger called Mishmish, which would shock purists who claimed that apricot belonged only to cats with whiskery snouts. \u201cIf it tells me, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sound like a fool.\u201d Leila\u2019s eyes softened. \u201cA shiny fool,\u201d she added, as consolation.\n\nThe night she signed the cousin\u2019s paper\u2014no stamp, no government letters, just the cousin\u2019s wide grin and a handshake that felt like a misunderstanding\u2014she walked to the sea to ask for permission. The sea said nothing. It exhaled a bit of foam, and a boy splashed it with his foot as if he could scold it into nodding. Somewhere behind her, a muezzin\u2019s call spread like a shawl over the roofs, and on a balcony a woman argued with her own echo.\n\n\u201cYa Rima,\u201d she said to herself. \u201cWhat if this is the thing that proves you do not know what you are doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI already know that,\u201d she answered. It did not make her turn around.\n\nNews in Beirut traveled like citrus, quick and exploding with scent. Before the tiger even arrived, word had emigrated from the abandoned cinema, hopped from hammock to hookah and lodged itself in mouths. A writer is bringing a tiger to Mar Mikhael, someone said. So these are the kinds of stories we are now. The man at the coffee cart shook out his napkins like flags and asked if she had lost her mind the way someone might ask for change.\n\n\u201cNot lost,\u201d she told him. \u201cRented.\u201d\n\nAbu Fadi, her landlord, did not see it. He was a thin man with thick eyebrows who liked to give out warnings the way other men gave out sweets. He had survived two property booms and the blast and a long marriage, so he believed he could survive anything except a tenant with a tiger. He stood in the stairwell outside her apartment, fingers knotted in a triangle like a child\u2019s attempt at a mountain.\n\n\u201cHabibti,\u201d he said, switching to the endearment only when he knew she would say no to his demand. \u201cThis is not allowed. It cannot be allowed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not in the building,\u201d Rima said. \u201cIt is in a different building that is not yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are my tenant.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am also my mother\u2019s daughter and my own head and my own rent. There are many things.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will have to raise your rent.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou already did.\u201d\n\nShe could not tell whether he was angry because he believed she would bring a danger into his life or because he had been left out of the decision. Beirut, for all its noise, had intimate rules. One of them was: do not make a spectacle on your own. If you are going to be ridiculous, invite everyone.\n\nShe told no one the day the truck came. It did not look like a truck for a tiger. It was unremarkable, dented, a beast that had carried its share of cabbages, and the men who climbed down from it wore the careful expressions of delivery men who will not ask questions if you behave like answers. The crate was heavier than she had expected and larger, as if it bristled with its own boundary. A white tarp fluttered like a lie over it.\n\n\u201cWhere do you want?\u201d the older driver asked, eyes on the ground, as if meeting the eyes of what he carried would tie him to it.\n\n\u201cInside,\u201d she said. \u201cThe back room.\u201d\n\nThere is a way the body knows when it is near the patience of something big. Her skin prickled the way it did when she swam beyond the buoys and imagined the belly of the sea turning below. They lifted, they dragged. The crate scraped the floor and left a bruise in the concrete. When they set it down, the air changed shape.\n\nThe tiger made a sound like a zipper dragged over teeth. It was not as loud as she had feared. It was the ordinary volume of a throat clearing itself. An acknowledgement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, because she had no other words and because the phrase had been spoken to her too many times to count. \u201cYou\u2019re here. It\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nAfter the men left, Rima sat on the floor, the dust half bright in a slanting beam of light, and put her face close to the crate. The tiger\u2019s eyes were yellow with green melted in, like somebody had left a shard of bottle to soften in sunlight. It did not look at her in the way a cat looks, as if you are a tide or a closed door. It looked at her the way the city sometimes looked at her\u2014interested, bored, unsure if she was worth the energy. She laughed. She could not help it.\n\n\u201cYou are not impressed,\u201d she told it. \u201cVery well. I am not impressed either.\u201d\n\nShe had planned for logistics. Ice. Meat. A tarp for shade. A hose. A heavy lock that was always to be doubled. She had not planned for the embarrassment that would fill her mouth when she tried, in the first hour, to say the name she had settled on in her head. \u201cMishmish,\u201d she whispered, feeling foolish immediately. The tiger blinked once, very slowly, as if it had been asked a question it had answered too many times in past lives.\n\n\u201cOr maybe not,\u201d she added. \u201cMaybe a different thing.\u201d\n\nShe texted Leila: It is here. And Leila: You are a ghost. I am at work. Send a picture. She didn\u2019t. It felt wrong, like intruding on someone in the shower. Instead, she put her notebook on her knees and wrote, not sentences but pieces. The city made a tiger, or the tiger made a city. The color of power is not orange but the hush before a door opens. Everything is a kind of adoption: apartment cats, ideas, grief.\n\nHer phone vibrated again. This time it was her mother. \u201cAre you free?\u201d Salma asked. \u201cI made mulukhiyah.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou love mulukhiyah.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing something.\u201d She hesitated. It would happen anyway, the telling. \u201cSomething complicated.\u201d\n\n\u201cComplicated like who you date, or complicated like when you tried to swim from the Bain Militaire to Raouch\u00e9 and had to be pulled out by that boy with the strange arm?\u201d\n\nRima smiled despite herself. The boy with the strange arm had become a recurring character in her mother\u2019s retellings. In the memory, his arm had been not strange but beautiful, a scar that looked like a river splitting a plain. \u201cNeither,\u201d she said. \u201cComplicated like a tiger.\u201d\n\nThere was a silence in which Rima could hear the television in the background in her mother\u2019s living room, and the kettle, and the sound of Salma\u2019s breath as she sought proof that her daughter was joking.\n\n\u201cYou are making words again,\u201d her mother said finally. \u201cIt\u2019s not real.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is.\u201d\n\n\u201cYa Rabb.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always wanted me to be ambitious.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted you to be married.\u201d A rustle, as if Salma had placed her hand over her mouth, not to stifle a sob but a laugh. Rima could tell the difference. \u201cNo, I did not want that,\u201d her mother corrected herself, surprising them both. \u201cI wanted you to be less tired. Does this make you less tired?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes me something.\u201d She pressed her fingers to the crate without thinking. The tiger shifted its weight, its fur dark and striped as a Japanese poem. Warmth moved toward her. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you pictures when I can.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t. I won\u2019t look. I will wait for you to come without pictures.\u201d\n\nIt was one thing to sit there in the first afternoon, drinking water out of a bottle that had lost its cold, whispering absolute foolishness to a massive animal. It was another to go home in the evening to her apartment door and her neighbor\u2019s door and the smell of frying onions through the hall. She half-expected to find the police on the stairs or Abu Fadi standing like a ragged awning, ready to collapse all over her with indignation. But the building did not know yet. A good secret can do that. It has weight, but it floats.\n\nInside her apartment were the ordinary objects of her life: the couch that had been her aunt\u2019s, the bookshelf her brother had built before he left, the plants that leaned toward the weak light like old women toward gossip. On the wall above her desk, she had placed a photograph of her father when she was a child\u2014him holding a plastic bat, wearing a grin that made his face look too open. He had died the kind of death that seemed to edge out all of his life, a suddenness that made every photograph a note of apology. She told him things sometimes, when she was brave enough to admit she still wanted to be understood by someone who had left the room.\n\n\u201cI did something absurd,\u201d she told the photo. \u201cAnd also good. I can\u2019t tell yet.\u201d\n\nShe slept badly, of course. She slept like someone who had handed her name to a stranger and worried it would be returned with a new spelling. In the morning, she went back to the cinema, carrying a plastic bag of butcher wrapped in butcher paper, and the tiger was awake and not asleep and awake again, a rhythm that made Rima think of a lit fuse that flickers and refuses to go all the way in. There was a discipline to how the animal moved. No wasted gesture. When she slid the meat into a low metal bowl through the bars, the tiger watched her the way a saint might watch a pilgrim\u2014amused, a little bored, silent.\n\n\u201cEat,\u201d she said, as if this one small command could balance all the others that were impossible.\n\nIt ate. Shudder of jaw, a sound that made the back of Rima\u2019s neck flex as if remembering a time when she had been prey in a myth she did not believe but that believed in her.\n\nLeila came at noon, beige slacks and a blouse that tried to behave, hair barely tamed. She stood at the threshold, not crossing, and stared. She had mascara on, which made her eyes look like someone had underlined them with a promise to try.\n\n\u201cHaram,\u201d she said softly. \u201cBut good.\u201d\n\nRima nodded. \u201cSay it: I\u2019m insane.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re insane.\u201d Leila stepped closer. \u201cWhat does it smell like?\u201d\n\n\u201cMeat and damp and something like a tire shop. And cinnamon, weirdly.\u201d\n\n\u201cCinnamon?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m making that part up.\u201d Rima put her hand on the doorframe. \u201cIt has a temperature. The room has a temperature.\u201d\n\nLeila slipped her phone out and then back into her pocket, guilty. \u201cCan I\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe later.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt needs grass.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt needs a thousand things I can\u2019t give it.\u201d Rima shook her head. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\nThey sat in the doorway, backs against stone, thighs dusted white, and talked as if they were girls again pretending to smoke. The tiger watched them and then did not. Outside, the city threw its usual parade. A truck of watermelons went bleating past, the driver leaning out of the window to argue with a honking, invisible opponent. Somewhere a hammer hit metal in the rhythm of a song from the eighties. A man practiced the oud with the windows open to prove he had a soul. Rima opened her notebook and wrote a sentence and then drew a line through it so that only the ghosts of letters remained.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to write about this,\u201d Leila said. \u201cOf course you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you will fall in love with someone inappropriate while you do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeila, please.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not wrong.\u201d\n\nRima was not sure if a tiger could smile, but sometimes the animal\u2019s mouth moved in such a way that a human might pour meaning into it. That afternoon, when the lights in the corridor flickered in and out because the generator had grown bored, the tiger lowered its head to the floor and let its tongue hang. It looked like a panting dog, which is not a dignified comparison for a creature that can swallow a deer, but it humbled him. No, her, Rima corrected. She had decided the tiger was a she because it made the story more complicated, which generally meant closer to the truth.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she told Mishmish who might not be Mishmish. \u201cWe are interesting together.\u201d\n\nThe first true objection came not from family or landlord or friend but from herself. On the fourth day, she woke to rain though the forecast had promised clear. Rain in summer in Beirut is a misbehavior that makes everyone talk about it as if weather were gossip. She walked to the cinema under an umbrella, the streets slick and gleaming, the puddles full of tiny, surprised fish of light. She arrived damp and agitated, unlocked the back door with too much hand, and found the tiger pacing in a way that made Rima want to ask forgiveness. It bounced, shoulder to shoulder, the pattern hypnotic\u2014four steps, turn, four steps, turn\u2014until the rhythm turned into a chant in Rima's head: You Are Repeating Yourself, You Are Repeating Yourself.\n\nShe gave the animal space and sat down on the floor outside the cage, pressed her forehead to her knees. \u201cI can\u2019t save you,\u201d she said, feeling the arrogant center of the sentence bruise under its own weight. \u201cI can only change where you are.\u201d\n\nHer phone rang. The name on the screen was Hadi.\n\n\u201cI heard,\u201d he said, without saying hello.\n\n\u201cOf course you did.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are trending.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not a verb.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are, a little.\u201d He let a chuckle fizz out and then took it back. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cDefine.\u201d\n\nRima imagined him standing near the short fence behind the ninth green, where he liked to watch golfers pretend not to cheat themselves of something. He had told her once that caddying made him feel like a man walking in a slow storm. He knew where every club was and where the ball wanted to go and he had no power to make anybody choose right. Hadi was not from Beirut in the way that Rima was\u2014born into the quarrels and tides of it. He came when he was twelve, fleeing something he did not tell her and a father who drove for a man who drove for a man. He liked to stand in whatever shade was available and name birds by their wrong names.\n\n\u201cWhat are they saying?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cThat you are insane. That you are brave. That you are lucky. That you are a Westernized soul. That you are a genius. That you are a problem. That you are hungry for attention.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of that is news.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso,\u201d he added, \u201cthat you should bring it to the club. The rough is so thick on the fifth that we will lose fewer balls.\u201d\n\nShe laughed more loudly than the joke deserved. The tiger paused and watched her for a beat and then went back to its restless walking. Hadi hearing that sound through the phone did something to the line. Static, like a secret metabolizing.\n\n\u201cYou came to my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought I should check your mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mind is a balcony with a broken rail.\u201d\n\n\u201cNice. Don\u2019t jump. Come swing tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter feeding a tiger?\u201d She considered it. There was something of penance in the idea. \u201cMaybe.\u201d\n\nBefore he hung up, he said, \u201cI bought a notebook.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor what?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo write what people say while they hit, and what they don\u2019t say. Maybe there is a book.\u201d\n\n\u201cHadi,\u201d she said, surprised by the sudden heat of pride in her throat. \u201cYou already write. You just haven\u2019t put it down.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d he promised in the tone of someone swearing he would do something impossible before coffee. \u201cI have plans.\u201d\n\nThat night, Abu Fadi slid a paper under her door with a signature of flourishes and a sentence that made no sense. It was an official invitation to cease ruining the building\u2019s reputation. He had stamped it with a stamp he had bought for himself years ago. He had once told Rima: if the stamp is red, the paper becomes serious. This stamp was red. It smeared.\n\nShe knocked on his door, paper in hand, and when he appeared, she held it up the way you hold a note from a doctor that excuses you from gym.\n\n\u201cI am ruining your reputation?\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone knows you are the one.\u201d He gestured as if her hair were a scandal. \u201cMy sister called me and said, What kind of people does your building take?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe kind with rent,\u201d Rima said. \u201cI have sent you this rent. You have cashed it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, your hallway plant is dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy hallway plant is struggling under the concept of July.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is dead. Throw it.\u201d\n\nIt felt good to quarrel about something small. It brought the air back into the room. She promised to remove the plant. He promised not to call the police. They looked at one another as if they were two very tired lions.\n\n\u201cShu,\u201d he said, softening. \u201cI\u2019m old. My heart does not want any more news.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen don\u2019t pick up the phone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to. I am the landlord.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to write,\u201d she said, and walked back to her door with the red-stamped paper that she decided to keep, for its ridiculousness, in a folder marked Important.\n\nBeirut can feel like a game of whispers and then, just as easily, like a shouting match where every door is a mouth. Rima started receiving messages from strangers. One asked if she was available for a podcast. Another offered the services of a brand new company that created unique experiences for influencers\u2014Would she like to host a pop-up tea ceremony for her tiger? An email from a young woman who signed herself Your Neighbor on The Internet said that Rima\u2019s choice made her think of the word caretaker in a different way. A man wrote to accuse her of colonial arrogance and also to ask if the tiger\u2019s eyes were as beautiful as in the photos that had been taken without her consent.\n\n\u201cPeople,\u201d Leila said, scrolling with a dismay that grew noisily. \u201cThey all want to be in the middle of the road and then complain about getting hit.\u201d\n\nRima turned off her phone for a day, which felt like plunging her head into cold water and leaving it there. She spent the hour before dusk sitting on a plastic chair in front of the tiger\u2019s enclosure, listening to the traffic become a lullaby and then a fever again. There was a rhythm to the city that she had not noticed when she was in the habit of speaking over it. Now that she was in the habit of listening, she felt it settle into her bones the way certain songs decide they own your walking.\n\nShe spoke, not to the tiger but to the air directly above its head. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to be looked at,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I like naming. I like the thing that happens when you point and tell yourself the truth about what you see.\u201d\n\nThe truth about what she saw shifted. Some hours, the tiger was the thing she had collected in order to become a larger person. Some hours, it was a mirror she didn\u2019t like. Some hours, it was simply itself\u2014an animal, wet nose and whiskers and a way of making the world look like it had been poured into a different shape.\n\nShe decided, finally, that Mishmish was the name she would say out loud, even if she used other names in letters she wrote to herself alone. Apricot. Sun. Pattern. Mistake. She stood one morning very early, in those moments when the city\u2019s loudness is clear and divided, and she said the name and it felt like throwing a seed at a hard wall and watching it split anyway. \u201cMishmish,\u201d she said. The tiger did not look, did not move, and yet the name landed.\n\nWhen she went to the club with Hadi, as promised, she felt foolish and sincere at the same time, always a strange couple in her. The course seemed greener in contrast with her concrete days, the palm trees the exact height of certain dreams of normal. Hadi handed her a driver like a blessing and a warning, both. He was not a caddy who whispered advice. He had learned she preferred silence shot through with jokes.\n\nOn the third tee, a man with a towel around his neck and a face like a dessert that had collapsed under its own sugar turned to her and said, \u201cI hear you have a tiger.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hear you have a temper,\u201d she said, as if she had a better hand than she did. He laughed too loudly, as men sometimes do when they are not used to being spoken to that way by a woman who does not hand them anything.\n\nHadi kept his eyes on the horizon and then peered back at her shot as if its arc spelled a word he had never seen. \u201cYou swung like you wanted something from the ball,\u201d he observed. \u201cYou can\u2019t want anything from it. It hears you.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything hears me this week,\u201d she said.\n\nBetween holes, he said, \u201cI\u2019m serious about my plans. I think I will meet someone. Like, a person who walks with people. You know.\u201d\n\n\u201cA therapist?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot that,\u201d he shook his head. \u201cA thing like that but with shoes you would wear to the mall. A coach for life.\u201d\n\nRima pictured Hadi\u2014whose advice usually came wrapped in the sound of laughter he tried to tuck away\u2014sitting across from someone who asked him questions until he surprised himself. The image softened the middle of her ribs. \u201cYou think you need a coach?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I think I need to keep walking. Sometimes a person joins you and tells you where the holes are so you don\u2019t break your ankle in the same place twice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds like caddying.\u201d\n\nHe flashed his clean sheet of paper face at her. \u201cYes, but for the body. Or the heart. Don\u2019t roll your eyes. I see you.\u201d\n\nShe hadn\u2019t rolled her eyes. Not exactly. She had rolled her brain. There was a difference. \u201cDo it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you do it, tell me what it is. If you don\u2019t, I will make fun of you for not doing a thing you said.\u201d\n\nHe nodded solemnly, then spoiled the solemnity by sticking his tongue out at her between two teeth like a boy.\n\nBack in the city, dusk slanted and then fell. She stopped for bread and tomatoes, and a man at the bakery told her the crust was better today because the oven had burned wrong all morning. \u201cSometimes you have to scorch first,\u201d he said, meaning the bread and not meaning only that. She wanted to tell him everything she knew about scorch\u2014the way the past leaves a mark in a building that smells like music that used to be sung there. The way the body carries a map of its previous extensions.\n\nInstead she carried her bread and tomatoes to the cinema and found a boy standing in the doorway holding a camera. He was probably twenty, hair in a messy pile, eyes too bright, an excitement that made his hands tremble.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said, not angrily but with the exhaustion of someone who knows that the sun will rise whether or not you ask it.\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he said, a word stretched into two syllables. \u201cI\u2019m a student.\u201d\n\nShe looked at his shoes, which were tearing apart at the sole, and at his camera, which was older than him. She thought of herself at twenty\u2014her mouth always open, her neck sunburnt every spring. \u201cYou can take one photo,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom here. And you don\u2019t publish it. You keep it. You put it on your wall. You tell your children you saw something ridiculous and beautiful.\u201d\n\nHe looked down the corridor as if opportunity were something that could be glimpsed like a stray cat and chased. He lifted the camera. The shutter clicked, noise small and satisfying. He lowered the camera and looked not at the tiger but at her.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, finally.\n\n\u201cBecause,\u201d she said with the idiot simplicity that is the only answer to certain moral math. \u201cBecause I wanted to be the person who could do it. Because I thought it would change me.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet.\u201d\n\nHe nodded as if she had offered him a glass of water and he had chosen to look at it instead of drinking it. \u201cIt will,\u201d he said with the certainty of the young. She didn\u2019t correct him. She liked his certainty, even if she didn\u2019t borrow it.\n\nThat night, she lay on her back on the floor of her apartment because the electricity had gone, because the fan was a dead soldier, because her bed felt like a trap. She listened to the neighbor\u2019s TV sputter and then fall silent. She listened to a plane that sounded too close. She listened to her own heart, which beat like it had a rope around it pulling it forward and back. She thought of her father again, of the way he had liked to teach her rules for games he did not play well. \u201cStand over the ball,\u201d he had told her when he pretended to teach her golf by tossing an orange into the air and catching it. \u201cDon\u2019t think about your body while you use it. If you think about it, it will be shy.\u201d\n\nShe thought of Hadi telling her about the coach he would hire, and she thought of Leila\u2019s eyes when she saw the tiger, and she thought of Salma refusing to look at photographs to make her daughter more likely to come home with her real face. She thought, not for the first time, that wanting to be changed by something is itself a way of looking away from your own lines, your edges, your name. She wasn\u2019t ready to argue with that thought. She pinned it gently to the wall like a moth under glass.\n\nIn the morning, she wrote for an hour without stopping, which in her world was the equivalent of a small miracle the size of a walnut. She wrote in a style that did not quite belong to her, because she had always been a liar about style, always trying on dresses that pinched at the ribs. She wrote about adoption and the way it is an aggressive tenderness. She wrote about Lebanon being a woman who had smoked too much and laughed anyway. She wrote a phrase she knew she would cut later because it sounded like something too ambitious, and also because she half-believed it: The tiger does not bend to me, and that refusal becomes a translation of my life.\n\nShe printed nothing. She sent nothing. She folded herself into the day like a note into a pocket. At noon, she went to the cinema and fed Mishmish and held a hose like a priestess and made a small pool on the floor and watched the animal put her paws into it with surprising delicacy. At three, she answered three emails and threw seven in the trash. At six, Leila texted her CAN I BRING SOMEONE? and then did not wait for the answer before arriving with a woman with a black bob and an aura of command. \u201cThis is Maya,\u201d Leila said, too quickly. \u201cShe edits things.\u201d\n\nMaya looked at the tiger\u2019s eyes the way a person looks at a painting she has decided to buy and then smiled at Rima with the smallest tilt of approval. \u201cAnd this,\u201d she said to no one, \u201cis a narrative that does not want to be wrangled.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does not want to be anything,\u201d Rima said. \u201cIt wants its old life.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\n\nRima almost said yes because it would have been a neat shape to hand someone who edited things. She almost said no because she wanted to be unpredictable. What she said was, \u201cI want my current life to feel like I noticed it.\u201d\n\nMaya nodded. \u201cI can pay you for a piece,\u201d she said, calm as a woman selling shoes. \u201cSomething not annoying.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can try to be not annoying.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t. Be annoying and then make it sing.\u201d\n\nThey stood in the doorway for a while, the three of them, looking at Mishmish who seemed, suddenly, absolutely uninterested in them. It was perfect. A person who has never been ignored properly will not fully understand how power works. Rima, who had been ignored by the right people at the right times, recognized in the tiger\u2019s not-looking not an insult but a gift.\n\nWhen they left, the street had shifted half a centimeter, the way it does every hour in this city, the light deciding to be liquid or not. Leila kissed her cheek twice and whispered something silly about buying a leash as they laughed and then agreed to feel bad about laughing. Maya put a hand on Rima\u2019s shoulder only for the time it took a sparrow to change its mind about a wire.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let this become a costume,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Rima said. \u201cI know, I know.\u201d\n\nAlone again, she sat and counted the minutes and then lost track of counting. She thought of Hadi and his notebook, of him writing down the beautiful, ugly sentences men say about their swings, about their wives, about their power. She thought of how he would hand those sentences to the person he would pay to walk with him into himself. She thought, in a way that embarrassed her slightly, of asking him to bring her along when he went. Not to heal, not exactly. To watch.\n\nShe did not sleep. She drifted. The following morning, an inspector of some sort came with a folded portfolio and a mustache that could have led, alone, a policeman\u2019s parade. He peered at the lock, at Rima, at the dimness of the room, and at his own fancy shoes.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d he repeated, helpless as a man whose job requires him to be sure. \u201cThere are forms.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring the forms.\u201d\n\nHe did not bring the forms. He brought a shrug that had been stitched with bureaucracy. She gave him a look that had been tempered by years of bureaucracies. He left and told someone. She told someone. By the end of the day, it had become a story about how the city would tolerate anything except the wrong kind of paperwork.\n\nHadi called at sunset. \u201cI met someone,\u201d he announced without greeting. \u201cNot for love. For the life coaching thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlready?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you, I had plans. Her name is Ghida. She looks at you and you feel like you are lying, even if you are reading your passport to her.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I booked a session. I will go on Wednesday.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want out of it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, honest. Then added, \u201cTo be less stuck. To stop making jokes when I mean something serious. To not be the friend of my own excuses.\u201d\n\nShe sat down on the curb in front of the cinema and watched a stray cat consider a cigarette butt. \u201cBring me something,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cA sentence that belongs to you with no laughter in it.\u201d\n\nHe hesitated. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cI will try.\u201d\n\nAfter she hung up, she looked at the tiger, whose breath made a soft fog on the bars when it exhaled. She looked at her hand, which had a crescent of blood where she had caught it on the lock earlier. She looked at the sky, which was the color of the inside of a fig.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be changed,\u201d she told the air. \u201cBut maybe I just wanted to be worth this story.\u201d\n\nThe tiger blinked slowly, then closed her eyes, and for a moment the room\u2019s temperature and the sound of the street and the beat of Rima\u2019s pulse and the history in her bones aligned like teeth in a good zip. She laughed once without a reason, the purest kind. The laugh did not cure anything. It made no good decisions. It was a small, true thing that came anyway.",

The generator in her building coughed, gathered itself, and then sulked into sleep more often than it should, as if offended by the idea that air should be cooled for free. Rima learned the timings of ice the way she once learned exam schedules, and she walked with a plastic crate under her arm to the alley where the ice factory operated behind a blue door that had been repainted so many times it looked like a palimpsest of winters. Inside, men in sleeveless shirts ceded space to slabs pushed out of a steel mouth, the blocks slick and milky as if the weather could be cut into bricks. The owner, a gentleman who introduced himself as Uncle Sami though he was probably younger than he wanted to be, looked at her crate and then at her face and then at her hands, which had acquired a geography of small scrapes.\n\n\u201cFor fish?\u201d he asked, not unkind.\n\n\u201cFor a tiger,\u201d she answered, because she had set herself the discipline of not lying in July.\n\nHe contemplated this with a seriousness that was both theatrical and real. \u201cI had a cousin who loved canaries,\u201d he offered, as if this established kinship. \u201cThey don\u2019t like heat.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one does,\u201d she said. \u201cExcept tomatoes.\u201d\n\nHe laughed, delighted to be carried into a logic that collapsed and still delivered them to the same place. When she asked for credit, he asked for a story. She promised him one good paragraph about his blue door and the way he wrapped ice with paper the color of the old flag. He frowned and said that flags made him itchy, then gave her an extra half-block because she had not asked for a discount, only permission to carry water in its coldest shape away from his domain. Outside, the air hit her like a mouth exhaling. By the time she reached the cinema, wet silicone had gathered under her arms and her shirt stuck to her back like a rumor.\n\nThe graffiti appeared two days later, the kind of handwriting that tried to be a stencil and failed, which made it more like the city than if it had succeeded. On the iron door: WE ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH PREDATORS. She stood and read it twice, then a third time, as if the words would soften under repetition. Leila arrived behind her, holding an iced coffee in a cup that perspired like a child after running, and tilted her head.\n\n\u201cAt least they spelled predators right,\u201d she said, always the teacher grading a pop quiz she had not assigned.\n\nRima ran her thumb over the P, which had a drip that made it look like it was crying. \u201cDo they mean me, or the tiger, or my landlord?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey mean anything a woman does that is bigger than somebody\u2019s idea of her.\u201d Leila took a long, savage sip. \u201cAnd also men, but men are used to being blamed for everything, so it rolls off.\u201d\n\nThey bought paint from the hardware store where the owner liked to hum the chorus of old songs while mixing colors. He leaned close to the letters and then to their faces, static on his fingers from the tape measure that hung from his belt like a tail. \u201cYou want to keep it, make it prettier?\u201d he asked, as if graffiti were a pet that demanded grooming.\n\n\u201cWe want to erase it,\u201d Rima said, and he nodded as if this was a haircut he understood. They painted in the late afternoon, the shade creeping inch by inch across the door like a confession that took its time. The first coat made the words ghostly, the second made them memory, the third felt like wiping a fever off a child\u2019s forehead.\n\n\u201cYour brother asked about you,\u201d Leila said without looking over. \u201cHe saw something online and pretended he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell him I adopted a watermelon,\u201d Rima said, and Leila\u2019s laughter snagged on the edge of her mouth and then fell free. There was comfort in the choreography of tasks\u2014stir, stroke, step back\u2014and in letting the ridiculous sentence stand between them like a small umbrella. When they were done, they stood back and admired their work, and for a second the door was simply a door, a surface that said nothing except handle me.\n\nThe NGO woman arrived wearing a cardigan in weather that had made men abandon dignity and shirts. She had the calm of a person who had written her name on too many forms and learned to sit inside time while it passed noisily around her. She introduced herself as Noura, said the words animal welfare without letting them sound like accusation, and stepped into the shade as if onto a stage she had paid for.\n\n\u201cWe heard,\u201d she said, and lifted her hands to indicate that the hearing had not been optional.\n\n\u201cEveryone hears,\u201d Rima replied. \u201cThe city is an ear with a mouth attached.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a center in the north,\u201d Noura said, and named a place that had once been a battlefield and now tried to be a field. \u201cNot perfect, but better. There is also a route out, with conditions. Paperwork is a sea monster. Money is its brother.\u201d\n\nRima felt the familiar scissors of shame open and close under her ribs. She watched Mishmish shift in her patch of shade, watched the ripples of muscle under fur like a map of dune ridges. \u201cI want better for her,\u201d she said, and heard the arrogance stitched into the sentence, the way it assumed her wanting had any weight at all. \u201cI also want to finish something I started.\u201d\n\nNoura\u2019s mouth made the shape of sympathy without the obsequiousness of it. \u201cThat is the problem with stories,\u201d she said. \u201cThey make you feel like a god, and then you look in the mirror and remember you are not even in charge of your hair.\u201d\n\nRima put one palm flat on the cage because she had not learned yet to stop herself. \u201cCan I come?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf she leaves.\u201d\n\nNoura looked her over like a doctor looks at a patient who has just asked to be allowed to be complicated. \u201cYou can come to the fence,\u201d she said finally, not unkind. \u201cLater, we can talk about roads. This is Lebanon. You know what roads are.\u201d\n\nRoads in Lebanon were episodes of a long-running show with sudden plot twists that made grandmothers throw slippers at televisions. Trucks disappeared on them. Lovers became exes and then furniture and then ghosts. Rima did not ask Noura to promise. Instead, she took a pamphlet that had been printed on paper too gentle for its subject and read the names of animals who had been saved and felt both relief and skepticism take turns in her throat.\n\nShe went to meet Maya in a caf\u00e9 where the coffee was strong and bitter, the way people claimed to like it when what they really liked was a story in which they behaved well under pressure. Maya was wearing a white shirt that had the casual crispness of a shirt that had never touched a sink. She waved without standing and slid a glass across the table as if she had been born to slide glasses in elegant arcs.\n\n\u201cI want three thousand words,\u201d Maya said, settling the numbers between them the way men settle cards. \u201cNo romance with your own adjectives. No saints. A problem with an animal that has your name in it somewhere and does not apologize for needing things.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do that,\u201d Rima said, not because she was sure but because the sentence had to be said by somebody and she was the only person at the table.\n\n\u201cYou can, but will you.\u201d Maya reached into her bag and produced a pen with a weight that made the table feel morally sturdier. \u201cThere is also the matter of protecting yourself. People will try to take your piece and make it proof of something they planned to say before you wrote it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople always do that,\u201d Rima said. \u201cIt is what they do at dinner.\u201d\n\nMaya smiled at the tiny cruelty tucked into the observation. \u201cI like your mother,\u201d she said as if it were a line in the piece. \u201cShe refused the photographs. That\u2019s a kind of discipline I recognize.\u201d\n\nRima thought of Salma\u2019s voice when she said I will wait for you to come without pictures, the way she had made love into a rule so that her daughter would be safer inside it. \u201cShe might come,\u201d Rima said, then corrected herself. \u201cShe will. She won\u2019t be able to not.\u201d\n\nHadi\u2019s voice came to her that evening over the grind of a bus that needed love desperately and the petulant bleating of a horn that needed to be banned. He stood on the sidewalk outside the club, she could tell by the birds in the background and the way he enunciated when he was pretending not to smoke.\n\n\u201cI went,\u201d he said, and took a breath that made her sit down without thinking.\n\n\u201cTo Ghida.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Her office is in a building with a dentist on the first floor. I could smell fear and mint.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did she ask you?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo tell her about my day without joking. I failed twice and then did it. She asked me who I hold umbrellas for when it rains.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hold them over men who forget rain is wet.\u201d He swallowed, and she could feel his throat through the line. \u201cShe asked me what I want to stop holding. I said, I do not want to be useful to men who think I am part of their equipment.\u201d\n\nRima pressed her fingers to her mouth, not to stop herself from speaking but to keep something from falling out that would make this less clean. \u201cThat is a sentence with no laughter in it,\u201d she said, satisfied in a way that felt like relief and pride holding hands.\n\n\u201cThere is more,\u201d he added, because he could not stop himself from making excess out of adequate. \u201cShe asked me what I want to be useful to.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what did you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to be useful to the part of me that stays when no one has asked me to carry their bag.\u201d\n\nShe closed her eyes and saw him with his hands empty. It shook something in her, the clean image of that. \u201cGood,\u201d she whispered, and then said it again, louder. \u201cGood.\u201d\n\nSalma arrived the next morning carrying a shopping bag as if it were a shield. The heat had made the city\u2019s old ladies sensible; she wore a cotton dress and her hair pulled back with a clip she had owned since before Rima was born. She stood in front of the cinema and refused to look up at its face, the way one refuses the gaze of a person one has not yet decided to forgive.\n\n\u201cI brought you okra,\u201d she said. \u201cI know you hate it. You will be forced to come to me to make a proper sauce.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can make a proper sauce,\u201d Rima lied on instinct, then stepped aside. \u201cDo you want to come in?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not want to, but I will.\u201d Salma stepped into the dim, her hand reaching for the wall without needing to see it. \u201cThis building smells like someone left a violin here.\u201d\n\nThey walked the corridor like two women visiting a relative in prison. At the threshold, Salma paused. Her eyes adjusted and then did not. Her breathing changed shape. A mother can stock the air with a hundred kinds of silence. This one was the silence of respect. Mishmish lifted her head and watched without the menace that Rima had feared and without the docility that would have felt like an insult. If there was a version of meeting that involved the exchange of breaths rather than names, this was that.\n\n\u201cHe is beautiful,\u201d Salma said, and Rima did not correct her. She rested the bag on a chair and leaned her knuckles on the table so that her hands would be doing something other than reaching.\n\n\u201cDo you remember,\u201d Salma began, a question that carried its own answer, \u201cwhen your father brought home a bird in a cage and the cage smelled like rust? I cried for the bird and then stopped crying because he looked like someone who had rescued it from a war. He kept it for a week. I wanted to hate him for it and then the bird left. He left the door open one afternoon by accident, and it took the window like a man takes a second chance. He did not forgive himself. He bought another cage and kept it empty for months.\u201d\n\nRima did not remember the bird. She remembered the empty cage, a square that seemed to catch light in its corners and make the living room too clever by half. She remembered putting her hand in and out and spanking the air. \u201cWhy did you stay,\u201d she asked, because the question was itself a family heirloom, inherited and avoided.\n\n\u201cBecause I had a child who loved a man who told her rules like they were jokes,\u201d Salma answered. She turned her head then, fast, and saw the two yellow coins of Mishmish\u2019s eyes blink and reopen as if counted. \u201cAnd because I did not know how to go anywhere else. People always think staying means not wanting the door. Sometimes it means not trusting the stairs.\u201d\n\nThey sat, mother and daughter on plastic, the tiger breathing in a rhythm the body wants to match when it is brave enough to admit it needs a metronome. Salma talked about the woman upstairs who watered her balcony plants with a hose like a dance, about the cousin\u2019s son who had married a Canadian who called bread bread and not khobez and had made the wedding taste foreign. Rima listened with the greedy attention she had when her mother\u2019s sentences decided to open a small window and let the wind come through. When Salma stood to go, she touched Rima\u2019s cheek with the back of her hand, the gesture of a woman who had measured fever that way for a lifetime.\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d she said, which in her tongue was a prayer and a threat and an oath. \u201cWhen you are ready to stop pretending this will make your name softer, call me. I will help you come back to stupid things like washing curtains.\u201d\n\nAt dusk, the generator died in so theatrical a manner it might as well have bowed. The air in the back room turned into a hand on the neck. Mishmish began the restless pacing, the four steps that made a square on the floor with each repetition darker than the last. Rima\u2019s stomach did the small contractive dance that precedes panic, a choreography she had learned so well she could do it while reading. She opened every possible door and window. She stood with a cardboard panel and moved air like a penitent doing a humble job for a capricious god. The boy with the old camera appeared again at the entrance, standing very still, as if motion would make him unwelcome.\n\n\u201cGo home,\u201d she yelled, then softened because his face crumpled. \u201cBring your mother a cold towel. She needs it.\u201d\n\nHadi came without being asked, the way rain comes to certain kinds of heat whether or not anyone prays. He stepped in with the calm of someone who can split a task into steps even as his own shirt stuck to him and his hair turned into small commas across his forehead. He took the panel from her and fanned with a rhythm that rejected urgency without denying it. In crisis, you learn the grammar of who you are. Hadi, it turned out, had verbs that surprised her.\n\n\u201cWe need ice,\u201d he said, and when she pointed to the half blocks, he broke them with a hammer he found like a magician produces scarves. They wrapped bits in cloth and placed them near the bars, not within reach, close enough to persuade the air it could be kinder.\n\n\u201cTalk to me,\u201d he told her as he worked, because he had learned to give the mind a song to sing while the hands did their ugly dance.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said but then found that she could. She told him about Noura and the road, about Maya and the three thousand words, about Salma and the remembered cage. She told him about the graffiti and how painting felt like mending a dress she didn't even like. He listened with the kind of attention that made the room feel less like a test.\n\n\u201cI was scared once,\u201d he offered, breath even, panels fluttering like flags in his hands. \u201cAt a checkpoint, when we were new and my father made a joke because humor is the only weapon we had, and the boy with the gun did not understand the joke and I thought I would be orphaned by a sentence. Every time a man raises his voice near me in the wrong way, the checkpoint steps out of the walls.\u201d\n\nRima absorbed this and then felt something unclench in her spine. The tiger stopped pacing, which felt like an agreement unrelated to what they had said, and lay down with an annoyance that mirrored the city\u2019s own attitude toward weather. They kept fanning longer than necessary because the body needed a ritual after it had decided to live again. When they stopped, the fan heaved once like a soldier who realizes he can sit.\n\n\u201cCome with me when I take her,\u201d she said, the words sliding out before she had decided to let them exist. \u201cIf I take her.\u201d\n\nHadi folded his panel and leaned against the doorframe, his shadow long and thin, a line drawn by a child learning to make the world less complicated by putting borders on it. \u201cIf they let you,\u201d he said, which was the right answer and the only one. \u201cWe can draw a map that is honest about its missing pieces.\u201d\n\nHer phone stuttered with messages that evening, as if every person she had ever met wanted to participate in the weather. Maya sent a photograph of a headline about a tiger that had been smuggled in cucumbers, proof that absurdity traveled with stamps. Noura sent a reiteration of conditions, of points where money had to be red and signatures blue and the word sanctuary would be written in a font that did not exist in any printer in a two kilometer radius. Leila sent a photograph of her own face with a filter that gave her whiskers and wrote under it, This is what people think activism looks like. Salma sent nothing, which was a message that made Rima smile.\n\nAbu Fadi knocked at nine, a gentleman\u2019s time for an uninvited visit. He held a standing fan older than much of the building, its metal cage dented by a history of clumsy shoulders and children. He did not apologize for its condition. He set it down in the middle of her floor and plugged it into a socket he had once forbidden her to use. He stood with his hands behind his back like a tour guide in an empty museum.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a boy,\u201d he said, staring at the fan in case life required it to misbehave, \u201cmy father took me to a checkpoint where they had a lion. The boys with the guns fed it chicken and called it security. I could not sleep for three days. I do not like animals inside cages, but I do not like them outside in the wrong mouths either. Take this. Bring it back when the weather has decided to become polite.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, which sometimes meant I see the thread you hide and the knot at the end of it. \u201cI will,\u201d she added, and knew a part of him would be watching her window to see when it disappeared.\n\nShe wrote that night under the fan\u2019s ancient breath. She wrote until the fan changed its hum to a higher pitch that meant it wanted to be left alone. She wrote a paragraph about ice that would make Uncle Sami proud. She wrote about the law of cities that makes certain acts possible and others impossible, and how law could be two things at once: protection and costume. She wrote about the first time she had held a line in her hands\u2014literal rope when she was eight and they had gone on a boat she had not asked to go on and she had leaned too far over the side and her father had said hold here and she had, knuckles white, not because she was strong but because she had not been offered a choice. She ended her page with a sentence that embarrassed her and saved it anyway: Sponsorship is a word that puts lipstick on hunger.\n\nMaya answered in the morning with a dot, then another, the punctuation of thoughts forming. When the words came, they were a small avalanche. Keep the sentence. Build a bridge to it. Do not let anyone wear the tiger like a coat in your piece. Let the heat be a character. Let the door be a country. Rima laughed aloud at her phone the way one laughs at a child making the correct noise while asleep. Outside, the city\u2019s voice warmed up in scales, horns checking their anger, scooters finding their notes.\n\nNoura called with a date shaped like a question. Rima repeated it to the air and then to Mishmish, whose ears moved in opposite directions like two women arguing before deciding to arrive at the same conclusion. The plan involved sunrise and a truck that would not look like a truck and a man who did not like asking for money but liked receiving it. It involved a checkpoint that consistently misbehaved, and another that, for reasons nobody understood, had grown tender in recent weeks. It involved being small. It involved being loud at the right moment and silent at all the others.\n\nHadi arrived with a small duffel bag and the look of someone who had packed more courage than clothes. He took the schedule from Noura\u2019s hand and folded it, then unfolded it, fingers tracing the route as if he were reading a prayer and checking where it might fray. Leila came with dates and almonds and a look she reserved for the first page of a new notebook. Abu Fadi did not come, but his fan stood in the corner, solemn as a witness. Salma called and did not say be careful. She said, if something happens, make sure you are wearing sensible shoes.\n\nThe night before, Rima could not make her body lie flat. She occupied chairs like a woman sampling fates. She stood in the doorway of the back room listening to Mishmish sleep, the animal\u2019s breath a saw going through soft wood. She picked up her notebook and put it down. She tried to list the stupid things she would be glad to return to: washing curtains, oiling the door, buying parsley too enthusiastically. She tried to imagine what she would write if the morning went well, and then what she would write if it did not. She settled finally on telling herself the simplest promise she could make. Tomorrow, you will carry. Tomorrow, you will stand where you are needed without making it a story until later.\n\nBefore sunrise, the city yawned. Its soldiers of bread rose from their beds, its cats finished their brief wars, its early walkers took the Corniche in a silence they would deny when asked. The truck arrived looking like any other thing that moves through streets, its dents a history of someone else\u2019s errors. The man at the wheel had eyes that had seen so many forms they had stopped believing in signatures. Noura clipped her hair back with the aggression of a nurse preparing a shot. Hadi rolled his shoulders like a swimmer about to measure his reach in a hostile sea.\n\nThey moved quietly because loudness is a currency you must save for the places where it buys you a little more time. The crate welcomed Mishmish like a room that remembered her dimensions. Rima stood at the door, and when the tiger hesitated, she did the one arrogant thing she allowed herself with animals and people she had promised not to manipulate. She stepped back and looked away, letting the space between them say I am not making you do this. When the lock slid, it made a sound that in the city\u2019s language means consequences will now arrive whether or not you ordered them.\n\nThe door to the street was open to a sliver that felt like mercy. Outside, a man swept dust from one place to another because this is what one does when one has a broom and the morning asks for proof of life. A woman in a headscarf counted coins into a child\u2019s palm. Somewhere a radio declared a number of dead and then moved on to weather without apologizing for the juxtaposition. The truck\u2019s bed took the weight of the crate and groaned as if it wanted to complain in public and then decided not to. Rima climbed into the cab because she did not know where else to put her body that would not be in someone\u2019s way.\n\nHadi paused at the door and looked at the room the way a person looks at an old apartment one last time, taking inventory not of objects but of the shape of mornings and nights. \u201cYou locked the back?\u201d he asked, already certain she had. \u201cYou remembered the bag of documents?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d she said, her hand on the stack of papers that had acquired the texture of talismans. \u201cI put them in plastic. The man with the stamp will want them to smell like nothing.\u201d\n\nLeila pressed her face to the crate for one second and whispered something Rima did not catch. Noura touched Rima\u2019s shoulder with two fingers, a benediction with no god attached. The driver cleared his throat once, a signal rather than a sound. The fan in the corner watched them with its broken dignity. The city inhaled. They rolled.",

Dawn painted the buildings with a kind of mercy it withdrew by noon, turning edges tender and scaffolding into a lace that did not cut. Rima watched the street unspool in a grammar she had always loved, the comma of a man pausing to adjust his shoes, the semicolon of a woman stopping to greet a neighbor before continuing. In the back, the crate made its own syntax, the quiet thump of weight shifting and the low, threadbare rasp of breath. Hadi sat forward with his forearms on his knees as if the road needed the additional attention, while Noura kept the documents on her lap like a lapdog that might bite if not stroked occasionally.\n\nThey passed the bakery where men already wore flour like medals and the electricity shop where coils of wire slept in the heat. A boy on a scooter pulled alongside for the length of a single glance and then took off again, as if his life could tolerate only one surprise before breakfast. The driver, who had introduced himself as Adel and then told them not to use his name even in their thoughts, kept his gaze nailed to a middle distance that was probably safer than any of their faces. He spoke only to the truck when the gear stuck, a private conversation he managed with a tender impatience that made Rima momentarily jealous.\n\nAt the first light, before Charles Helou shrugged them toward the highway, Hadi reached back and thumped the crate gently twice with the flat of his hand, the way you thump a stubborn heartbeat. \u201cWe are moving, habibti,\u201d he said in a voice that had learned new shapes from Ghida\u2019s traffic cones of questions. \u201cWe are not good at moving, but we are doing it anyway. You can be unimpressed.\u201d The tiger answered with the sound of a zipper again, softer this time, as if agreeing to the terms without endorsing them. Rima wanted to put her forehead on the wood in thanks, but Noura looked at her and shook her head once, just enough to make the lesson land: do not teach this animal that your skin is a part of its map.\n\nThe sea slid in and out of view like a shy relative, then asserted itself in a sheet of pewter as they skirted Bourj Hammoud, Jdeideh, the industrial blocks with their dust and stubborn manliness. Billboards promised things the city laughed at: a gate to a gated life, a watch that could stop time before it got embarrassing, an apartment with the kind of light you rented elsewhere. Rima\u2019s phone quivered and then died the way a sparrow does, quick and apologetic. She put it facedown on the dash out of habit, as if respecting its tiny funeral would keep it from rising out of spite.\n\n\u201cThis first one,\u201d Noura said, not naming the checkpoint as if names invited accidents, \u201clikes the idea of itself. It wants to be told it is necessary. We will give it that. We will do it in blue ink. You will not say more than hello.\u201d She pressed a finger against each of their wrists in turn, a silent consecration that felt practical in a way religion sometimes failed to be. Adel grunted, then lifted the corner of his mouth slightly as if the road had told a joke no one else had caught.\n\nTraffic thinned and then congealed again around them in the human-weather pattern Rima had once tried to explain to an American editor who thought gridlock should be linear. A truck full of melons adjusted itself in their lane and then remembered dignity and moved back. A bus belching black thought for a moment that it was a sports car and then remembered things about weight. When the concrete of the first checkpoint rose like a sentence fragment ahead\u2014tired sandbags, a canopy that had once been white, the soldier\u2019s chair at a tilt\u2014Rima felt her throat do the small, ridiculous tightening that years had not trained out of it. Even in a city that had taught her the difference between danger and drama, a gun tilted at your world remained untranslatable.\n\nThe young man with the vest the color of resentments put his palm up and Adel stopped so gently Rima loved him for the first time. The soldier walked to the driver\u2019s window and bent half his body into the cab as if he had been invited. His mustache was a declarative mustache, the kind you trusted to have opinions. Behind him, another soldier smoked as if the cigarette had married him too early and he was doing his best to love it. Noura passed the first paper, then the second, each sheet he read with that particular outward boredom that means inside him a hundred little calculations were happening about potential money, potential trouble, potential time.\n\n\u201cWhat is this,\u201d he asked finally, gesturing toward the back in the tone of a person who already knew what this was but wanted to hear your version. He lowered his head to peer past her shoulder, eyes narrowing the way they did when men tried to see in bars with bad lighting and got fooled by their own certainty.\n\n\u201cElectrical components,\u201d Noura said, and her voice wore a cardigan too, a soft that concealed steel. \u201cHeavy. Certified. For a humanitarian partner. It is not wise to disturb them because of the calibration.\u201d She put her finger on a stamp in the middle of the page, and Rima watched his eyes do what eyes did in this country in the presence of ink that had chosen a color with confidence. The soldier nodded at the stamp as if it had greeted him by name.\n\nFrom the back, Mishmish exhaled, and the soldier\u2019s lashes lifted because even men who loved stamps had instincts. Hadi leaned forward with the ease of someone who had learned to offer distraction like an appetizer and tilted a plastic cup toward the soldier\u2019s hand. \u201cCoffee?\u201d he asked with a sincerity that made Rima want to kiss his cheek for all the times he had given parts of himself to men with guns and gotten away with it. \u201cIt is too early to work without it.\u201d\n\nThe soldier hesitated as if an unseen director might shout cut, then took the cup and sipped and made the face of a boy whose mother had taught him to behave in front of guests. He handed back the papers with a small flourish that meant he wanted to be remembered for conceding. \u201cGo,\u201d he said, and then, as if the word were offensive, added, \u201cQuickly.\u201d Adel did as told with the practiced timing of an accomplice to a magic trick, upshifting away from the gaze that clung and then let go.\n\nPast the checkpoint, the horizon behaved as if its job were to reward humans for surviving bureaucracy. The road widened, the sea announced itself, and a line of cranes drew a clumsy ballet against the sky. Rima surprised herself by placing a hand on her chest not to calm her heart but to congratulate it for not showing off. She looked at Hadi and he looked at her and in the small tilt of his mouth she read a sentence without laughter. He did not need to say it. She loved him for that restraint.\n\nThey rode the shoulder of Antelias, then Jounieh with its guiltless seafront churches and strip of newer sins. Men walked their shirts over their heads as if decency could be rearranged to please the weather. The truck groaned into climbs that made its bolts confess things, then slid down into a speed that felt briefly like a promise to the future. Chekka\u2019s cement factory rose to their right in a pale, powder-caked geometry, a monument to the kind of industry that made lungs into family heirlooms. The tunnel swallowed them and then spit them out with the relief of bad cinema that knows it is bad and so tries to overcompensate with brightness.\n\nThey had to stop for ice at a fishmonger\u2019s along the road in Kfar Abida, a low-slung store with styrofoam boxes stacked like the teeth of a patient who had decided to show everything. The boy who came out to see what they wanted had salt drying in the creases of his elbows and eyes that could have belonged to a seal. \u201cFor fish?\u201d he asked, because the world needed its refrain, and Rima almost told him no, for God, but Noura spoke smoothly about temperatures and Adel lifted his chin to indicate the urgency.\n\nWhile the block was slid with newspaper into their crate, Rima walked three paces away and bought lemonade from a woman who had the forearms of someone who squeezes truth out of things for other people\u2019s relief. The glass was sweating the way all their faces were, and the first sour swallow shocked her into something like gratitude. Hadi accepted a sip with a theatrical grimace and then kept the cup longer than manners instructed, so she reached for it and their fingers knocked softly as if applauding one another for arriving at this morning with a courage they did not have two months ago.\n\n\u201cSecond one is worse,\u201d Noura said when they were rolling again, half apology, half weather report. \u201cThey have a man with a new job. Men with new jobs want to make history with your time.\u201d She did not look at Rima when she said it, which was kindness, because it allowed the fear to be shared among them like bread rather than pressed into someone\u2019s hand like a bill you owed.\n\nThe poles that marked the second checkpoint appeared as if they had planted themselves out of stubbornness alone in a place that did not need them. The canopy here was an arrogant blue, and the chairs under it looked like they might refuse to break even if asked kindly. A radio crackled the way radios do when they are tired of being the heart that gets carried into every small war. A sign with too many words tried to perform legality and failed, which is the closest approximation of law Rima ever fully believed in. Adel took his foot off the gas in a way that made the truck consider the idea of stopping and then accept it as fate.\n\nThis soldier did not bend himself into anyone\u2019s cab. He stood and let them come to him, a trick of posture that men learn from tall dogs. He looked at the papers with the disinterest of someone who had decided in advance that the papers would be interesting only if they contained money. The second soldier, a young woman whose hair was tight under her cap in a way that made Rima\u2019s scalp ache, took two steps forward and then two back as if practicing for choreography that demanded both forwardness and retreat. The heat had made everyone theatrical.\n\n\u201cWhat is that sound,\u201d the man asked without moving his mouth much, and Noura said the same sentence in the same cardigan and tapped the same stamp in the same place. The woman took a half step to her left and, against her will or because she was the kind of person who could not help being alive even in uniform, snuck a glance at the back where the tarp had a corner that lifted and dropped with the rhythm of breathing. Rima knew it was breathing because she knew the tiger\u2019s metronome now, but to the eye with less practice it might have been the truck itself, tired of work.\n\n\u201cIt is too early to open,\u201d the woman said, addressing no one in particular in the tone of someone who had agreed with herself in the morning about something and was not prepared to argue with that person yet. \u201cYou will break it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will not open,\u201d the man countered, because any sentence hanging in the air needs its opposite to anchor it in Lebanon. His eyes flicked to Hadi, whose posture radiated the plausible deniability of a cousin hired to carry things. \u201cYou,\u201d he added, because the pronoun pleased him, \u201ccome down.\u201d\n\nHadi did, his shoulders loose, his hands out from his body not in surrender but in the offering of a man who knows how to demonstrate he has nothing useful to steal. He moved like a metronome, slow, deliberate, the tempo of someone calming horses. \u201cMy uncle will kill me if this calibration is disturbed,\u201d he said without smiling, and the soldier\u2019s eyes did that tiny narrowing again, the calculation recalibrating, the word uncle finding a hook on which to hang an outcome. In this country, uncles were both real and omnipresent and fictional and useful. They were also occasionally the state.\n\nNoura let money arrive the way pity should: quietly and in proportion to need. She did not peel off a bill like a magician pulling silk from an unlikely sleeve. She placed a thin bundle inside the sheaf of papers in a position that required flipping to find it. The soldier executed the flip with the unhurried ease of a man choosing to remember he was human. The bills were old in the way money gets old here, corners soft, numbers a joke the currency had played on itself. He did not smile. He cleared his throat in a way that meant agreement and a small shame. The woman looked away not out of softness but as an accord to dignity, which in some places is the same thing as compassion.\n\nOn the far side of this permission, the road opened and then narrowed again, every purchase on progress a limited-time offer. The sea darkened to a serious blue. The grass on the median attempted nonchalance and failed. Tripoli drew nearer in smells and silhouettes, the castle keeping its watch with the resigned patience of old authority. Noura spoke briefly into a small radio that looked like a toy and was not, her Arabic elegant even when she was arranging trucks. Adel\u2019s knuckles whitened once and then remembered themselves. Hadi allowed his head to fall back against the seat for the width of a sigh.\n\n\u201cDo you think she knows,\u201d Rima asked finally, and even as the pronoun left her mouth she hated how it made a person out of an animal in a way that served her. \u201cWhere we are going, I mean. Or is this just\u2014another room.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe knows the weather,\u201d Noura said, and it was such a clean answer that Rima sat with it like a stone in her hand, noting the shape. \u201cAnimals know heat and movement and the moods of people holding doors. She knows you, because you sit in one position like a person who plans to be forgiven. But she does not know north from south the way we think we know it. She will know better when we stop.\u201d\n\nThe sanctuary\u2014or the idea of it, because the word felt delicate in their mouths\u2014sat inland on the slopes where olive trees did the work of old men, watching and producing and insisting on their usefulness. The turnoff was foolish and then became a road with arrogant stones and then a track that belonged more to donkeys than to dented trucks. A boy with a balloon stood watching from a wall as if waiting for applause for simply existing so well in this heat. A goat declared its opinion of them in a voice that made Rima think of her landlord\u2019s stamp and how the two were equal in power in many situations.\n\nWhen the gate appeared, it didn\u2019t at first. It was the absence of movement where fences began, the way boundaries make a silence around them to alert the attentive. A man with heat-swollen knuckles swung the gate back, his face giving away nothing except that he had learned to love animals and people in the precise ratio that kept him from breaking. He nodded at Noura, then let his eyes rest for a second on Rima as if acknowledging that strangers collected their own disasters and delivered them like gifts that were both welcome and not.\n\n\u201cKarim,\u201d Noura said into the air and then into his hand when he offered it, and the gatekeeper\u2019s mouth made a shape Rima recognized from men who had been asked for more than they had to give and refused to become bitter as payment. He led them to a low stone building whose interior had been scoured into cleanliness, the kind that looked like a promise kept one thousand times in small ways. A chain-link pen stood to the side like a mouth mid-sentence, and beyond it a field where shade was an argument that trees had nearly won.\n\nThey did not open the crate at once. Animals do not need your catharsis more than they need order, and Karim lifted a finger in the air to hush the urge to see her step into her new constraint. He tuned the room the way musicians tune an instrument no one will play. Water first, then quiet, then the low murmur of human intent bending itself to usefulness. Adel stood just inside the door and for the first time allowed his body to confess fatigue, which made Rima appreciate him as a creature rather than an instrument. Hadi took the coil of rope from the floor and tested its give, not because it would be used but because hands need a task when the heart is near the edge of a pond it has been told not to fall into.\n\n\u201cLater, we try the enclosure,\u201d Karim said, finally letting language join them officially. \u201cToday, we let her breathe a new square. Tomorrow, we move the sky.\u201d His smile cut his face in a way that was tender and ugly at the same time, which is to say true. \u201cYou waited for this,\u201d he added, and Rima felt seen in the way that made her grateful and angry, a combination that had fueled many of her jokes and too many of her mistakes.\n\nWhen the locks slid, she stood at a distance she measured with the rules Noura had given her and the ones her body had learned in the last month. Mishmish stepped forward with the offended grace of a queen getting off a plane that had not landed on time. The scent of new dust slipped into the old dust like cousins meeting for the first time at a funeral. The animal took the light with her like furniture taken out of a room modifies the remaining shadow. She turned once, a half circle that made patterns blur, and then settled on a patch of concrete that felt, perhaps, like its own absence of catastrophe.\n\nKarim moved without moving, the kind of stillness that is work. He kept everyone behind an invisible line he had drawn in his head years ago and could lay across a floor with precision. He held a hose in his hand not pointed at her, letting the notion of water populate the room before its reality arrived. He spoke under his breath to Mishmish and to the air and to the mistakes of men who had brought animals here in worse situations and demanded miracles out of polite rooms. Rima did not cry, because she did not want to see herself crying in this story at this point. She allowed her face to rearrange itself quietly, which is one of the few strengths she inherited from Salma without resenting the source.\n\n\u201cI will come back?\u201d she asked Noura and then regretted the question because of the upward tilt of the last word. \u201cIf I can, I mean. If you say my face will not make her ask for a different room.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can come,\u201d Noura said. \u201cYou can also learn how to leave. Both are acts. We practice both.\u201d It was not a comfort and it was not not a comfort. It was a sentence Rima recognized as having been written long before either of them spoke it.\n\nThey stood for a time that couldn\u2019t decide what it was\u2014long enough for Mishmish to close her eyes and open them again and close them once more, long enough for the sweat on their backs to confess itself through fabric, short enough that they kept thinking of the truck as still moving. The sounds here were different from the city, not quieter exactly but less busy with themselves. A donkey complained in an alto that made Rima smile despite herself. Somewhere a dog hit exactly three barks and then reconsidered the point. The wind admitted that it had been to the sea and come back with gossip that did not concern them.\n\nLeila messaged that she had eaten half the dates she had packed for them and felt guilty and then better, a very Leila sequence. Maya sent a question mark and Rima answered it with the outline of a tiger drawn with too much wrist, which Maya would either berate her for or frame. Salma did not call. The empty space where her mother\u2019s voice would be settled itself at the base of Rima\u2019s spine and kept her upright in a way the truck had not.\n\nLeaving the crate felt like leaving a church after lighting a candle. You exit into light you are not ready for, and you think about errands before you should and you half expect the sky to insist on solemnity and of course it does not. Karim shook Adel\u2019s hand in a way that honored the driver\u2019s part of the prayer. He put a hand briefly on Hadi\u2019s shoulder and said something low that made Hadi nod, a single sharp thing that looked like agreement with himself. To Rima, he offered nothing except a long look that took in the thin newness of her and returned to her an older thing she might be able to wear.\n\nOn the way back, the road changed its order because roads are like that around here, but also because the vehicles moving on it had gathered other stories during the hours they were occupied elsewhere. The billboard now featured a different woman whose teeth promised a different future. A man with a ladder moved it from the shoulder to the bed of a pickup with a balletic seriousness that broke into laughter when the ladder kissed him on the ear. Hadi leaned his head out of the window and let the heat clap his cheeks in the way of an elder admonishing and blessing in the same gesture.\n\n\u201cYou did it,\u201d he said, quiet so it could be true without ceremony. \u201cYou tried to make a door and then you helped someone walk through it. It is less insane in the doing than in the saying.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought it would make me\u2014\u201d she began, and stopped before the word famous could humiliate them both. \u201cI thought it would make me more like the person I want to be when I think about myself in the dark.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are exactly as annoying as before,\u201d Hadi said kindly, and she let herself laugh because both halves of the sentence had room for that. \u201cMaybe there is less noise between your ears. Maybe not. We will see.\u201d\n\nWhen the second checkpoint appeared again in reverse it behaved like a different man who had borrowed the same body. They were waved through without fanfare because unpredictability had clocked out. The first did not look up from his phone. By the time Beirut\u2019s shoulder rose to meet them, the air had grown thick with afternoon and the promise of generator breath. The Corniche was full of pairs and trios walking the length between memory and practicalities. The city had not changed while they were gone, which should have disappointed her and did not.\n\nBack at the cinema, the iron door blinked at her new paint in the overstated light of four o\u2019clock. The fan waited where she had left it, patient and old and obnoxiously correct. Rima stepped inside and the absence of the crate struck her like an extra sense she hadn\u2019t named before. The room was emptier in the way a hand is emptier once you have taken off a ring you didn\u2019t always like. She stood in the middle and let that hollowness ring against her ribs until it found the note it wanted to hold.\n\nThe first thing she did was pick up the hose and coil it with the care of putting a child\u2019s arm into a sleeve. The second thing she did was sit on the plastic chair and put her feet where the square of pacing had darkened the concrete, a small sacrilege that felt like measuring her shoe against a footprint at a museum. The third thing she did was open her notebook and write three sentences about the way a truck sounds when it carries something that resembles consequence. The fourth thing she did was text Salma: She is in a place with trees, and then wait for her mother to not answer, because that too was a way of being answered.\n\nHadi peeled himself off the doorway and stretched his back, then announced that he was going to buy too much watermelon and that she had no choice but to help him eat it. When he left, the hallway coughed up a neighbor who wanted to tell Rima about the eggs she had found that morning with shells so thin it felt like breaking promises with her breakfast. Rima listened with governmental attention, nodding in the right places, and when the neighbor asked about \u201cthe matter\u201d, Rima said something so bland it graduated into poetry. \u201cWe are practicing being less ridiculous,\u201d she answered, and watched the relief move across the woman\u2019s face like shade in a courtyard.\n\nShe slept a little on the couch with her mouth open, an unglamorous sleep she had been snobbish about once and now regarded as a gift. When she woke, her body had learned three new translations for the word tired and the heat had learned another way to be inside her. She went to her desk and wrote without aiming for herself, the way a person waters the part of a garden that doesn\u2019t belong to her so she can look at it later and remember that the world makes things she didn\u2019t plan. The first paragraph was about the morning, the second about the second soldier\u2019s eyes, the third about the way money feels when it is wrapped in paperwork like a bad truth dressed as a good one.\n\nAt some either-or hour, the phone vibrated with Salma\u2019s name and Rima did not pretend she might not pick up. Her mother\u2019s voice wore a layer of fatigue that had been ironed flat by competency. \u201cI bought soap,\u201d she said without greeting, which was her greeting. \u201cThe curtains are so filthy I am embarrassed to hang them in any story you will write. Come tomorrow and we will make the kitchen smell like lemon and old television.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come,\u201d Rima said, and was startled to hear herself sounding as if she believed she deserved a quiet job. \u201cBring me news about the woman who waters with the hose.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe watered too much,\u201d Salma said with the satisfaction of someone whose predictions of folly had been validated. \u201cHer basil is offended. It is still alive. You can be like the basil, habibti. Offended and alive.\u201d\n\nAfter they hung up, Rima went back to the cinema and stood in the doorway as the day divided itself into the two cities everyone always had to choose between: the one with electricity and the one without. She thought of Mishmish, of the rectangle of shade Karim had calibrated, of Hadi\u2019s shoulders at rest when he finally let himself sit on the stoop with a wedge of watermelon and spit seeds with the joy of a boy who had been given permission to be vulgar. She let the thought of Maya\u2019s deadline press against the front of her skull the way a pet presses a nose against a hand it might let bite. She did not try to make the next day come faster. For a woman always in love with the next paragraph, it felt like letting a wild and inappropriate animal put its head in her lap and keep it there while she breathed.\n\nWhen night came, it did not perform. It slid in with the minor chords of generators and a cat\u2019s yawn and the sigh of a city that had once again chosen to live despite having reasons to abstain. Rima took Abu Fadi\u2019s fan back and he looked at the empty place where the crate used to be and said nothing about it, which in landlord was a compliment. He did tell her the plant in the hallway had made its decision and that death did not need to be discussed in public. She thanked him like he had given her something, because he had.\n\nOn her way back upstairs, she saw the boy with the messy hair sitting on the steps, his camera in his lap and his head leaned against the wall in that uncontrolled posture of someone who could nap even through artillery. He opened his eyes when he heard her and smiled, and for the first time since he had appeared in her doorway she liked him without needing to mother him or warn him off. \u201cDid it work?\u201d he asked, and when she nodded, he lifted the camera not to photograph her but to hold it to his own forehead like a cool cloth. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, and there was such clean belief in the two syllables that she wanted to give him a paragraph to keep in his pocket like a talisman.\n\n\u201cGo home,\u201d she told him, and then sat with him for five minutes exactly, saying nothing, watching the staircase\u2019s shadows with the precision of two people who had watched enough dramatic things to recognize the quiet ones that mattered more. He stood when she stood and they nodded at each other as if exchanging identifications. On the last step, she thought she heard the sea breathe, which was ridiculous and also correct. She went inside and closed the door gently so it would not forget it was a door and not a drum, and the city outside kept talking to itself in a language she had finally stopped pretending she did not speak.",

                              "content": "The curtains made a sound when they came off the rod that reminded Rima of a small animal surrendering, not loud enough to be tragic, just audible enough to register. Salma had stacked bowls of lemon halves like bright moons along the edge of the sink, and the radio on the counter insisted on giving recipe tips between traffic updates in a voice that had survived three wars without adjusting its tone. Soap foamed with a sting that made the pads of their fingers feel both punished and absolved. In her mother\u2019s kitchen, even fatigue felt domesticated; it sat in the chair with the broken cane seat and agreed to participate in discussion in the proper order. They worked without performing it for each other, because work memorized between two people is its own dialect and requires no glossaries.\n\n\u201cYou tie the knot the wrong way,\u201d Salma said for the first time that morning, and it was a sentence that could have applied to the curtain rope or to a list of Rima\u2019s romances. Rima smiled because she liked the way her mother made critique sound like heritage. The window pulled a stripe of heat over their forearms every time the breeze lied and pretended it would be relief, and the lemon made the air smell like somebody had tried to erase an old mistake with a citrus eraser. Salma\u2019s hands moved with the fluid bossiness of a woman who had taught a sock to become a puppet because the child in front of her had demanded entertainment when money refused to participate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m writing the piece,\u201d Rima announced, and the pronoun was the only piece of swagger she allowed herself in that kitchen. \u201cMaya wants it with a spine. She says if my sentences do not have backs, readers will hang their coats on them anyway and complain when the coats fall.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen to the woman who wears crisp shirts,\u201d Salma replied, because style was not separate from authority in her book. She turned the curtain so that the clean side accused the dirty side, and the contrast embarrassed them both a little. \u201cWrite, but don\u2019t leave words like snakes under people\u2019s beds. We already have mice.\u201d\n\nRima thought of the mice in the back room of the cinema, the way they had adjusted their routes around a crate that smelled like wilderness. She thought of Karim\u2019s hands that had held rope and hose with equal competence, and of Mishmish stepping into a rectangle of new air with a queen\u2019s skepticism. She told her mother only the parts that could be told without making the room tilt\u2014the road, the second soldier\u2019s eyes, the bit of road where the sea decided to be serious. Salma listened with the concentration she reserved for recipes that did not belong to her lineage and therefore required extra humility. When the curtains hung again, wet and temporarily dignified, they were heavy as a promise kept for now.\n\nThe piece grew around the sentence Maya had bossed her into keeping like a woman makes soup around a bone she refuses to toss. Rima wrote in the morning because her body had conceded that resistance at eleven felt like silliness and at seven felt like a principle. She wrote about the heat as if it were an uncle with a loud laugh who visited every year with the same jokes, and about paperwork like a sea monster that occasionally let a boat pass when it was in love. She described the truck\u2019s grammar without showing off, and the men who decided whether she could pass as if they had invented ambivalence and wanted credit for it. She wrote about her fingers wanting to slide between bar and fur and the way adults teach themselves to stand back when they want to step forward, and she kept that paragraph even though she feared it made her look sentimental in a way she had mocked in other people.\n\nMaya sent back notes that were half scalpel, half flirtation. She deleted three metaphors because they were doing the same work with worse clothes, and she circled a line about sponsorship with a pencil that must have been expensive because even the mark felt rich. Keep this. Bury it where no one expects to find it and then let it walk out on its own legs. Rima found herself obeying with a pleasure that at nineteen would have offended her, because she had confused obedience with surrender and had not learned yet the difference between good editors and dictators. They met once at a caf\u00e9 where the spoons were cold on purpose and where the barista had revolutionary forearms. Maya took the seat facing the door and glanced at Rima\u2019s mouth when she laughed as if checking for a small lie. \u201cYou have a dangerous relationship with your endings,\u201d she said, and Rima answered that she had worse relationships with other things, so she would take that as progress.\n\nHadi came to her apartment the day before his third session with Ghida and sat on the floor with his back against the couch because the fan was honest there. He wore a T-shirt with a logo that had meant something once and had washed itself into anonymity. From his pocket he produced a slip of paper that had been folded and refolded into a piece of origami that did not exist. He passed it to her without ceremony and chewed the side of his thumb not because he was nervous but because he had never learned a better habit.\n\n\u201cI told a man no,\u201d he said while she unfolded. \u201cAt the ninth, the one who throws his club as if gravity were flirting with him. He told me to clean his ball with my shirt because the towel was \u2018tired\u2019, and I told him I was not an extension of his laundry. He laughed and tried to make it a joke, and I did not let him have it. He called me difficult. I told him that difficulty is movement when you are used to a wheelchair.\u201d\n\nOn the paper, in his precise letters that somehow managed to look like someone apologizing to a line, he had written a sentence that carried its own weight correctly. I do not have to be agreeable to be good. Rima read it twice and then a third time in the same way she had read the graffiti on the iron door, and this time what dripped was not accusation but relief. She told him that if he wrote twenty more sentences like this he would have a stack a man could sit on. He looked at her with the wide open face he hated and loved when it took over and then ruined it by sticking his tongue out, which was a relief to both of them because earnestness should be interrupted by ridiculousness at least once an hour in this heat.\n\nNoura called with the tone of someone requesting a favor while also delivering good news and asked if Rima wanted to come up to the sanctuary on a day that would be unwise to drive but perfect for a small ceremony. \u201cThe sky is wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cBut Karim says the animal is ready to feel grass that remembers bigger feet. If you come, you do not own the moment. You are invited to borrow it. Wear shoes that will forgive rocks.\u201d Rima agreed and then put down the phone and stood still for a full minute because sometimes stillness was a superstition and sometimes it was a way to let the news move through without getting stuck.\n\nThe sanctuary smelled different when the heat stepped back temporarily and let the earth breathe. Trees made shade that wasn\u2019t an apology but a plan, and the insects made a choir so industrious it sounded like a factory run by gossip. Karim nodded once at her from under a hat that had once been a better hat and motioned toward a gate at the far end of the pen where Mishmish had learned the new square, the chain-link singing quietly the constant high note it kept whether or not anyone listened. The small procession was absurd and precise: Noura with a clipboard as if paper could domesticate fate, Karim with a length of rope on his shoulder he would not use, two volunteers whose eyes had learned the trick of being present without becoming a mirror, and Rima with a watermelon under her arm because Hadi had given it to her with a grin and a knife and the idea that rituals could be invented for animals who did not need them.\n\nThey opened two doors that had agreed to behave like one, and then they opened the idea of the sky. Mishmish considered it the way a woman considers a dress she has always admired on other bodies. She stepped onto the shade first, which was sensible, and then the sun, which was not na\u00efvet\u00e9 but an experiment. Her paws adjusted the way small boats adjust when moved to bigger water, and her breath changed and changed back in a rhythm that told Karim it was fine and told Rima that whatever gratitude she wanted from this creature would be a human thing she would have to give herself. The animal bent her head to the grass the way a queen lowers her face to a bouquet from an obedient city and then, in a gesture that made Karim exhale a laugh he had not authorized, she rolled onto her side once with both dignity and abandon. The fence when struck by sunlight made a careless lace all over the square of her and then stopped making metaphors because it was a fence and had no right.\n\nThere were other animals at the edges\u2014eyes that had learned to accept squares in exchange for not being eaten, ears that had learned the privacy of listening when men used the wrong voices around them. Rima did not ask their names because she had begun to respect the inefficiency of not knowing things. Noura signed three lines on a form that appeared to be the same form as yesterday and yet was not, and whispered to Karim about a hyena that had grown good at refusing medical interventions and a monkey that had fallen in love with a broom. \u201cLet her smell you,\u201d Karim told Rima when they had stood enough in their corner to be polite, and Rima reached her hand no farther than the air that remembered her. Mishmish glanced, blinked once, and returned to her grass. It was exactly the right amount of affection in a story that had remembered not to be hers.\n\nThe piece went online on a Thursday night that felt like Tuesday because calendar arithmetic had stopped working weeks ago. Maya had given it a title that Rima would have never given anything she wrote because it behaved itself and got to the point without wearing jewelry. People read it with the greedy speed of boredom given food, and then they read it slower, and then they sent it to their mothers and to their enemies. The line about lipstick and hunger lodged in the city\u2019s mouth the way a piece of pita gets stuck against the back molar and cannot be dislodged by tongue alone, and the paragraph where Rima confessed to wanting to be considered worthy of a story brought her inbox both praise and knives.\n\nA woman wrote to say that she had hated Rima for two days for being exactly the kind of writer who thought her feelings should be allowed to drive, and then she had forgiven her because of the sentence about ice that reminded her of her father\u2019s hands. A man wrote to tell her he had taken photographs of bears in Syria and had never told anyone because the bears\u2019 eyes had made him stop believing in light, and he had cried in his bathroom not because of her but because chemicals in the traffic fumes had made him sentimental. An uncle wrote to say that the word sanctuary irritated him, and a girl wrote to ask if the tiger\u2019s stripes were really as symmetrical as they looked in cartoons. Noura called to say that three people had inquired about donating without their names being written anywhere and that even if two were lying this was a miracle and a half. Maya sent an emoji she would never admit to owning and a message that said, now do not enjoy your little fame in a way that breaks the piece\u2019s back.\n\nLeila arrived the next day with a haircut that had committed to its own unevenness and a story about her boss that required a chair because indignation should be told from a higher place. She had ordered a protest T-shirt online and it had arrived with the slogan misspelled by one letter, and somehow that error had described the whole country more perfectly than anything else had that morning. She wanted to quit, and then she wanted to burn the office down, and then she wanted to ask her mother if she could move home and become the version of herself who thought she would be a teacher because chalk had looked like magic. Rima told her to quit for fifteen minutes every day as practice and to stay for the other twenty-three hours and forty-five minutes as an experiment. They sat on the floor with watermelon and spat seeds into a bowl until the bowl resembled a small conspiracy.\n\nAbu Fadi caught her on the stairs with a look on his face that was arguing with joy about whether it was appropriate to appear in public. He had read the piece because his nephew had sent it with too many exclamation marks and he had said he did not like exclamation marks because they were unhygienic. \u201cYou did not embarrass our building,\u201d he informed her, which was his native dialect for congratulations. He told her the plant in the corridor had finally chosen dignity and had been replaced by a snake plant that would not dare die in this heat because it did not have the necessary imagination. When she thanked him for the fan again, he waved away gratitude as if it were a fruit fly and asked if the fan had stopped making that high whining noise that meant its bearing needed oil. She was, in that moment, overwhelmed by the tenderness of men who think they are talking about machines when they are talking about love.\n\nThe boy with the older camera found her outside the bakery, waited until she had finished being told about the oven\u2019s mood by the baker, and then showed her his one photo. He had kept his promise. He had taken it from the threshold so that bars and light and the idea of an animal had been invited to share the frame without any one of them feeling used. It was better than proof. It was the sort of photograph that made you think of windows. \u201cCaption it with one sentence you can\u2019t take back,\u201d she told him when he asked what he should do with it. He nodded like a person accepting medicine from a spoon and promised to try. He asked her then if writing felt like this all the time, like balancing a bowl of water and laughing because you were not allowed to spill. It felt nothing like that, she told him. It felt worse and better and sometimes like dry bread.\n\nOn the Corniche, twilight made men into silhouettes that looked taller and women into punctuation marks placed carefully in the sentence of the day. The sea breathed truths it refused to share with anyone who asked for them by name. Rima walked to the bench under the tree that had always understood hair and took from her bag a notebook and a pen that worked only if held at the correct angle, which was to say stubbornly. She had promised herself a page that was not about tigers or laws or the heat\u2019s biography. She wrote about a boy she had once loved for three months and then pretended not to know because he had called her his mountain and she had realized she wanted to be river. She wrote about the woman who watered her basil too much because of fear and then corrected herself, watering less because she had converted fear into discipline, which is one of the few miracles available to civilians. She wrote four sentences that no one would ever read and felt the fan of Abu Fadi\u2019s apartment turning somewhere above like proof that small machines can make decisions in your favor when you are not paying attention.\n\nGhida called her because Hadi had given her number and asked if she wanted to sit for an hour in a room where the chairs made no sounds and the curtains had been chosen by someone who knew what you were doing with your eyes when you lied. Rima told herself she was going to see what Hadi talked about, not because she needed anything. She sat on a couch that did not claim to be anything else and listened to a woman ask questions that were knives with soft handles, and she surprised herself by not performing. The hour stretched and contracted and then finished. She did not cry. She did not become new. She agreed to come again because agreeing to come again was the least dramatic way to tell herself she had noticed something.\n\nAt the club, a week later, she stood over a ball and did not ask it to give her anything except its flight. Hadi watched with his arms crossed in an arrangement that looked casual and was not. \u201cSwing like you have already written the paragraph,\u201d he coached, which was either ridiculous or the only useful thing anyone had ever said to her about sports. She swung and found, to her irritation and delight, that the ball obeyed an agreement she had not made consciously. The man with the towel around his neck watched and kept his mouth shut because the day was hot and he had used his jokes elsewhere. Hadi did his small owlish nod that meant he was proud and would deny it later if it made the air sticky.\n\nThe city did what it always did with other people\u2019s business: it took it and made it taste like the thing you already had in your mouth. The piece spawned counterpieces and endorsements and a sticker on a lamppost that made Rima laugh because it was a cartoon of a tiger wearing a keffiyeh and sunglasses and the word APRICOT underneath in a font that would embarrass a child. Someone spray-painted THANK YOU on the iron door and then someone else added FOR WHAT? and then a third person drew a flower with six petals that looked like it had been painted by a woman on a phone call that had lasted too long. She bought a paintbrush and did nothing because the door had become a conversation and not participating in a conversation is one form of speech.\n\nNoura sent a video ignorant of the concept of resolution in which Mishmish stood with her head up in a light that did her stripes a favor and then lowered it to push her cheek against the wire as if the world were a thing that could be nudged into a more favorable angle. Karim wrote two words under the video that were not a caption so much as a verdict: She remembers. Rima watched the video with the particular jealousy one feels for animals who know where they are without having to name it, and then she walked home and made eggs and burned the first one and laughed alone in her kitchen because even breakfast half the time is betrayal and romance.\n\nThere was a protest on a Saturday that drew the city into one place briefly like a magnet makes a shape out of filings. Rima went because staying home is also a political act and she had done too many of those this year already. The signs were better than two years ago because everyone had learned to spell in anger and to not rhyme when rhyme made things silly. A man sprayed water in an arc that made strangers bless him for being generous in public, and women stood with their backs to the cameras so that their faces would not be borrowed for arguments they did not want to join. Rima walked beside Leila and did not talk because chanting felt like karaoke and she had never liked karaoke, but she liked the way the chant moved through other people\u2019s ribcages and made them taller for an hour. When the line dissolved into smaller lines and then into individuals moving toward hummus, she felt for a moment the particular sadness of people who know they will go home to the same walls and the same bills and the same threshold and that the world changes so slowly it sometimes looks like a statue.\n\nMaya asked her to sit on a panel about stories and animals and the way cities digest both without chewing, and Rima almost said yes because a chair with a microphone is a love language she has been trying to divorce for years. She said no and then walked to the room anyway and stood in the back like a teenager and listened to people say useful and useless things in equal measure. She went home and wrote about washing curtains instead, and when Maya read the paragraph about lemon and apology and the dignity of rod and fabric, she wrote back a one-word email that made Rima tear up because it was exactly the praise she had always wanted. Finally.\n\nHadi told her he wanted to stop caddying soon and to try to be the person he had imagined out loud as a joke, the one who walked with people and named holes before ankles found them. He had two clients who were both women who liked to pay for things up front and a boy who had refused money and brought him, instead, three mangos and a book of poems with half the pages uncut. He asked Rima to help him write a page that explained what he did to people who did not believe in anything except receipts. She agreed to sit and ask him questions until he had answers that wanted to be written. They did that work at a table in a caf\u00e9 with chairs that were slightly too low for the table, which made the whole business feel like humility. His sentences arrived reluctantly and then, when they felt safe, came fast, like stray cats deciding the hand being offered was not a trick.\n\nThe first rain in September arrived with the arrogance of a guest who had been late on purpose. People stood at their windows pretending to find fault with it so they could explain later why they had not invited it in. The drops were enormous and spaced wide as if a sky had to remember how to do this work after too many months of fire. The smell of dust being made into mud slipped under doors and into shirts and bent the shoulders of men who had forgotten to call their sisters. Rima walked to the cinema for the pleasure of watching water make the floor dark and round, and found the boy with the older camera standing under the awning wearing his father\u2019s jacket. He told her he had written his sentence and she asked him to read it aloud because some phrases exist only in mouths. He cleared his throat and looked at the photograph and said, softly and a little too fast, I did not know a cage could teach me the size of my own hands. She told him to slow down and say it again and he did and the rain approved with a louder spell of itself.\n\nSalma came with plastic bags tied like balloons and a vegetable stew that had not asked to be anything other than what it was. She sat on the couch and called the fan an old man for falling asleep mid-conversation. She told Rima that the woman with the hose had become famous in the building for killing thrips by flicking them with a nail she refused to cut, and that neighbors had begun to ask her for basil as if she were a bank. They watched a drama on television in which a sister betrayed a sister for a man who owned a restaurant, and they argued in a low voice about whether it was believable that any woman would abandon a sister for the owner of a restaurant that served its hummus with pink peppercorns. When the episode ended on a cliff and the commercials arrived with their plastic gusto, Salma turned to her daughter and said, as if passing salt at dinner, \u201cEnough with animals for a while. Write about something stupid like laundry. We need that stupid. It is our vitamin.\u201d\n\nShe went back up north once more in that season because the roads permitted it and because Karim had said the animal had learned a path around the enclosure that was hers and he wanted Rima to see it once and then stop coming for a while. She stood at the fence with her fingers flat against the air and watched Mishmish trace a map that had been drawn in her muscles, a loop that looked complicated and was not. Birds made announcements without translating themselves for humans, and an olive tree released a single leaf with the solemnity of a man signing a treaty. Karim told her that the animal had scratched herself on the rough trunk of a tree and had not bled, and that he had been relieved in a way he could not explain to anyone who had not waited all afternoon for an animal not to bleed. He told her that one of the volunteers had cried because she had looked into Mishmish\u2019s eyes and seen patience and forgiven herself for none, and he had told the volunteer to stop using animals as mirrors and to buy a plant.\n\nOn the way back, traffic at the second checkpoint held them like a sentence refuses to end when you are tired. The man with the mustache was not there; a new boy had taken his stool and was trying to learn the moral weather. Noura, on the phone with someone whose voice was all vowels and deadlines, waved and got a wave back and Rima watched a village\u2019s worth of power exchange itself in two small gestures and a flick of a wrist. She was, for a moment, overcome with a love for predictability so intense it made her think of extinguishers mounted on walls, and then someone cut across two lanes and nearly removed their side mirror and she remembered where she lived and smiled at the road even though it could not see her.\n\nAt night, she wrote a paragraph about hands. She wrote about her father\u2019s and Karim\u2019s and Hadi\u2019s and the boy with the camera\u2019s and Abu Fadi\u2019s and her own when they gripped a rope or a pen or an orange thrown as a golf ball or a soaked curtain being wrung out in a kitchen that had cataloged more disasters than a newspaper. She wrote that hands have their own handwriting and that if you place your palm on a table you will hear a story if you are patient and impolite. She wrote that letting go is a verb you learn with wrists first, not heart. She kept that paragraph not because it was good but because it was honest enough to be allowed in the room with her other better paragraphs without staring at them too long.\n\nIn bed she practiced not thinking about anything that had claws. She practiced not rehearsing arguments she would never have with strangers under online articles. She practiced wanting small things and then wanting nothing. She told herself out loud that she could be the kind of person who brought a tiger to the city and then took her out of it and still be allowed to have other sentences. Sleep came like a woman who had been kept waiting and decided to forgive her anyway for the sake of the next day, and the generator sang its minor key and then took a breath and held it, which in this city was a kind of lullaby.",

                              "content": "The morning after the rain, the city wore its damp like a new scarf it was not sure how to arrange, and Rima woke into a light that had sharpened edges and polite shadows. The window screens exhaled a fine cool and the apartment had the smell she privately called the smell of beginning again: metal a little cleaned by weather, lemons somewhere insisting on their usefulness, dust deciding to behave. She boiled water on the stove because the generator had chosen to rehearse indifference, and the kettle\u2019s thin scream braided with the radio from Salma\u2019s kitchen through the wall so that for a moment the two rooms decided to be one. She thought about the piece and its small ripples and about Mishmish tracing her uncomplicated path around an enclosure, and she let the fact that there was nothing dramatic to do today settle over her shoulders like a shawl she had learned to like by wearing it often.\n\nShe took the bus out of superstition rather than need, because buses were a way of asking a city to tell you what it thought of you without resorting to surveys. Men clung to the inside of the door as if it were a family tradition and a boy balanced a tray of coffees for a distance that felt like a miracle performed for free, and when they lurched towards the ring road a woman in blue sandals began to tell a stranger the exact recipe for keeping basil arrogant. Rima listened with the greed she reserved for other people\u2019s recipes and imagined the basil on her neighbor\u2019s balcony raising an eyebrow at the advice, then turned her attention to a billboard in which a woman with a powdered face sold a future that included better skin and, somehow, a passport. She wanted to be irritated and found instead that she was fond of the way the driver\u2019s rosary clicked against the plastic of the dashboard, a little percussion instrument insisting on its right to be part of the orchestra of this day.\n\nMaya had asked for a proposal that did not apologize for being a book, and Rima sat in a caf\u00e9 with tables that had been repainted so many times the wood was an anecdote under coats of ambition and looked at a blank document titled In Care Of. She wrote an opening paragraph and deleted it because it was writing like a person pretending to be someone who had written a first draft before, and then she wrote another that was worse and kept it out of spite. She watched the barista wipe the counter in circles that got bigger when the conversation with a friend got more interesting and felt a sudden panic that she was trying to invent a ladder to a roof she was not sure she wanted to be on. She drank her coffee, which did not try to be metaphorical, and began again with a sentence about the way time bends around acts of attention, and this time she did not delete it, not because it was good but because it pointed in a direction that made her body lean.\n\nShe met Hadi in the late afternoon under the jacaranda that had decided to drop purple without consulting anyone\u2019s schedule, and his face had a shine she recognized from boys who had learned to say no without apologizing for the electricity that followed. He told her he had two clients who had cried and one who had laughed and one who had simply looked at the floor and asked if he could be rude for an hour without consequence, and that he had stood the whole time because sitting would have made him patient and he wanted to be something else. He confessed that he had written an invoice and then rewritten it three times because the numbers looked like confessions he was not ready to make, and she told him to pick a number he would be embarrassed to say aloud and then divide it by two and then add a little for the future. They had the kind of argument that friends who trust each other have about money, which always ends with the air between them slightly cleaned and the sense that if they were in fact poor they were poor together in a way that made it less humiliating.\n\nThe inspector returned to the cinema at a time of day chosen to make statements feel bigger, his mustache trimmed down into a more aerodynamic opinion and a new folder under his arm that had learned to perform consequence. He stepped inside and stood in the square where the crate had lived as if waiting to be haunted, and when he realized the ghost would not show itself, he clicked his pen twice and looked at Rima the way teachers look at students who insist on being difficult on Fridays. He had brought forms after all, and he laid them on the plastic table like a deck of cards while informing her in a tone that attempted fatherhood that fines were possible, that permission had not been granted in advance, that the city wanted to be consulted even when it had no plan to help. Rima listened until listening became an act of politeness rather than civic duty, and then she said yes in the correct places and said mm in the places where agreement would be a lie pretended in the service of peace, and when he asked her what had been inside she told him the truth in the past tense and watched it become small immediately in his expression.\n\nThe graffiti reappeared in a different hand, one that wrote letters like ladders without rungs so that phrases looked like they had given up halfway to escape, and this time it read: TAKE YOUR SHOW ELSEWHERE. Rima stood and read it as if it were advice from a relative with an agenda and then went to buy paint and did not paint it because she did not want to erase the record of a city talking to itself in bad moods. Leila came with a paper bag of sesame biscuits and announced that she had quit her job for forty-five minutes and then taken it back and that she was experimenting with freedom in small doses like a person who has been fasting and understands that gluttony will make her sick. They sat on the threshold and ate and talked about leaving and staying and about another person they knew who had moved to Berlin and now pretended it was impossible to find parsley, and for a moment both of them were loyal to the idea of another place. The biscuits left a dust that felt like a blessing on their fingers, and a boy on a bicycle coasted past so beautifully upright they both applauded in their heads.\n\nSalma\u2019s neighbor began to lose names at the edges, the kind of forgetting that makes everyone suddenly experts at tenderness and at denial, and Rima found herself sitting in the woman\u2019s living room while Salma argued with a cousin on the phone about the difference between help and interference. The neighbor offered Rima a plate of pistachios and then forgot she had done so and then offered again, and the B-movie on the television looped a scene in which a man promised a woman he would become a better version of himself after the next commercial break. Rima thought about the way memory could be a country with borders that changed every night without announcing anything to the neighbors and wondered how many versions of her father remained in Salma\u2019s mind and which one was allowed to cook in the kitchen of their shared nostalgia. When they left, Salma kissed the neighbor\u2019s forehead and called her by her name because names were the last flags you surrender, and on the staircase she said aloud to no one in particular that the city should charge tax on worry because otherwise it had no revenue stream that made moral sense.\n\nUp at the sanctuary, Karim began to trust her a little in the specific way that men who live with animals trust women who do not insist on being looked at while they are being useful, and he let her carry buckets without monitoring the angle of her elbows. The goats had learned to ignore new humans unless those humans tried to be goats, and the monkeys had learned a routine of mischief that involved the theft of exactly one glove every afternoon as a demonstration of their commitment to humor. Mishmish was larger than she had been in Rima\u2019s mind, which made Rima think of how certain friendships improve when they are allowed to grow beyond the size of the story that started them, and when the animal lay in a patch of sun she did it with the authority of a creature that has decided to impress nobody. Karim spoke with his hand on a fencepost as if that made the words less arrogant coming out, and he told her that an animal does not become a lesson unless you insist on it, and that the best days are the days when nothing is learned and everything is done.\n\nNoura had an argument with a ministry that pretended to be a person in a suit and ended the phone call with a sentence that could have been used as a knife if she had wanted to cut anything, and then she laughed with her whole face in a way that made Rima want to like all bureaucrats who did not deserve it. The road back down from the sanctuary had softened with the rain and insisted on making the truck perform intimacy with the earth, and a boy carrying a basket of figs that were more bruise than fruit offered them one each with the generosity of a person who had decided to be rich when he had a handful of sweetness. They drove with the windows down so they could carry the smell of the hillside into the city and smear it across the concrete like a charm that would not work, and when they passed the billboard with the new watch promising to stop time Rima yelled at it, gently, to mind its business. The sea took their voices and did not bother to give them back, which felt like relief.\n\nHadi asked her to attend one of his group sessions because he had discovered that when men sat in a circle they either said nothing or everything and he needed a woman who could be a chair that asked questions without being sat on. She sat with four men who had learned their own names in different countries and listened to a man who had once been called a genius in a room with glass walls confess that he had begun to hate his own adjectives, and to another who admitted that he sometimes wandered the supermarket for the comfort of fluorescent certainty. Hadi kept time without looking at his watch because he had learned the length of other people\u2019s courage in minutes, and when one of the men said that he was tired of his jokes not being funny anymore Rima said gently that perhaps they had done their work and could be put to bed. The hour stretched and then snapped back, and as they stood to leave she watched one of them fold his anger into a pocket like a handkerchief he might need later and decided she liked this quiet work even though it made her skin feel too thin for a while.\n\nThe landlord\u2019s sister moved in on the third floor and rearranged the hallway with rugs that smelled like storage, and her boy left sneaker marks on the staircase in patterns that suggested dance and impatience. She greeted Rima as if they had once shared a table at a funeral and asked immediately what exactly it was Rima did for a living and whether it made steady money, and when Rima said writer the woman made the face people make when told about a medical condition they do not believe is real. Abu Fadi watched from his doorway with an expression that combined pride and dread and later told Rima in the tone of a man confessing a small sin that his sister had been sent back to him by a husband who needed space, and that she would bring many plants and many rules and that everyone should prepare themselves. He then handed Rima a small bag of nails and asked her to fix the hinge to a cupboard because the carpenter had become allergic to his own promises and needed to be punished by being replaced with neighbors.\n\nShe and Leila went swimming in Batroun one evening because their bodies demanded salt like a song and the road had given them an hour in which to pretend they were women who could decide such things. The sea held them without asking for names and handed them back to the shore gently, and they lay on their towels with wet hair like children after a long day of pretending to be dragons. They talked about leaving again and about staying again and about how staying could be a plan and not a failure if you dressed it right, and when the sky put on its apricot they said the word Mishmish at the same time and then did not talk for a whole minute, which for them was a rare and expensive silence. A group of teenagers practiced sorrow by kicking a ball and missing on purpose so they could groan and then laugh, and Leila told Rima that she had made a list of ten things that would make her life 7 percent better and that she was on number three, which was buying a trash can she did not despise.\n\nThe proposal grew in layers like a cake for a person who despises icing, and Rima began to enjoy the feeling of building something that did not need to be shared yet, which she realized was a new pleasure for her in this century of public drafts. She wrote about the difference between sponsorship and care with fewer metaphors and more nouns, and she placed the chapter about Mishmish not at the beginning like a surprise she needed to spoil for herself but closer to the middle, where the weight could be carried by other stories that had none of the glamour of teeth. She investigated her father with restraint and decided that when she wrote about him she would put the best version of him in the kitchen and the worst on the balcony, which felt fair because balconies had always been where her family confessed its foolishness to the open air. When she sent ten pages to Maya, she cried in the bathroom before reading the notes not because she expected cruelty but because kindness had begun to be a thing that frightened her when it arrived on time.\n\nGhida asked about her sleep and Rima lied to see if she would be caught and then laughed at herself because lying to a woman you pay to hear you tell the truth felt like buying fruit and complaining about sweetness. The room where they sat had a plant that looked like it had been rescued from someone who overwatered it, and Rima stared at its leaves while she tried to describe what it meant to be watched by a city and also to be ignored by it, and how both could be a kind of hunger with different symptoms. Ghida said she was not interested in sentences that sounded like awards and asked her what she had wanted to do a week ago but had not, and Rima said that she had wanted to take the bus to her father\u2019s grave and talk to the grass and had not because she had been embarrassed of her own theater. Ghida asked what was theatrical about talking to grass when grass minded its own business as a rule, and Rima admitted that she was not embarrassed for the grass but for the part of her that would try to narrate the meeting as if she were a magazine.\n\nThere was a small fire in a building down the street that was extinguished by neighbors with buckets and one man with a hose who did not turn the water off at the tap afterwards, and the result was a river down the stairs that carried cigarette butts and one slipper to the sidewalk where it laid them out like evidence. Rima watched from her window with the fascinated helplessness of a person who had not been chosen by crisis and felt the cheapness of that relief, and she went down to help carry a couch after the smoke had decided it had made its point. An old woman whose voice had never learned to be quiet thanked everyone loudly and declared the fire a cousin to all the other problems, and then asked if anyone had a fan to lend because her room had become the inside of a boiled potato. The street organized itself the way certain families do when death is visiting someone else and decided who would cook and who would clean and who would be allowed to sit with the woman and talk about God without pointing too directly at Him.\n\nA letter arrived in the mail three weeks late and looked like it had fought a small war with a puddle and lost, and inside it was a note from the cousin of the owner of the old cinema asking in a tone of injured magnanimity whether she would be willing to pay a little more for the space now that it had acquired fame. The cousin had included a smiling photograph of himself holding a plate of grilled fish as if to prove that he was a man with appetites and not just a signature, and Rima took the letter to Abu Fadi like a child taking a misbehaving pet to a neighbor who had a way with animals. The landlord read it with the full attention of his eyebrows and then said he would handle it in a way that made Rima briefly love hierarchy, and he called the cousin and told him that if he had wanted more money he should have raised the rent before allowing his building to become a saint. When he hung up, he told Rima that he had saved her three meetings and two insults and that she owed him a tray of knafeh, and for once she did not argue with the economy of that exchange.\n\nHadi\u2019s father appeared one evening with a plastic bag full of oranges that had been discouraged by their tree and asked if the building had a view of the harbor from a window he could stand at for a minute. He had a voice like cardboard softened by rain and eyes that had chosen to forgive more than they should have, and he stood at the window and watched nothing in particular and said only, it looks the same as twelve years ago and then it looks different, which is how time behaves when it wants to show off. He sat and drank tea with too much sugar and told her that Hadi had been the kind of boy who picked up nails from the road as if the road needed to be protected from itself, and that he was glad his son had found a way to ask men for money by giving them something that was not a lie. Before he left, he pressed a coin into her palm as if she were a child, and she put it in the bowl where she kept lost screws and spare buttons and the gold tooth of a story she had never written.\n\nAutumn entered like a woman who has always had a key even if nobody remembered giving it to her, and the air did that trick of moving across skin as if it were reading. The city adjusted its noises downward by a half-step and soups began to be spoken of with more respect and shirts decided to be sleeves again. Rima found that her nights were less aggressive and that sleep visited without needing to be negotiated with like a poorly behaved guest, and she began to dream in longer sentences that did not require her to wake and write them down to be believed later. She went to the club twice in a week and did not apologize to herself, and she stood over a ball and swung without demanding any lesson from it, and when it landed where it should she felt the particular satisfaction of being competent at something that did not matter beyond the minutes in which it was being done.\n\nThe panel she had refused happened without her and then happened with her when Maya, who knew her better than she would admit, texted to say that one of the speakers had misunderstood the difference between metaphor and fact and could she please come and be impolite in an educated way. She stood on stage in shoes that did not pinch and said what she had promised herself she would say if ever given a microphone again, which was that animals were not reputations and that stories could be useful if they were built to be used rather than admired. A man asked a question that was really a speech and she answered with a question that was really a refusal, and the audience murmured the way audiences do when they are grateful to be watching someone else argue about a thing they feel strongly about. Afterward, a woman with a notebook asked her if she was afraid and Rima said yes in the voice of a person ordering bread, and the woman wrote the yes down as if it had been a more complicated word.\n\nThe boy with the camera brought her a copy of his photo printed on cheap paper that made the blacks into slowly surrendering grays, and he told her he had written his sentence on the back and then decided not to because he wanted the picture to be a place where people could be honest without being told what to think. He had been offered a small job at a wedding where the groom wanted to look surprised at being loved and the bride wanted to look like a person who had invented forgiveness, and he had said yes because money had become a muscle he wanted to train. He asked her how to invoice and she gave him Hadi\u2019s sentence and told him to double it because weddings are expensive. He laughed in the untidy way of boys who have not learned to hide delight, and then he asked if the tiger remembered her and she said that what mattered was that the tiger remembered trees.\n\nOne evening near the end of the month, Salma called with the particular structure of breath that told Rima she had been about to say something else and changed her mind, and she asked if Rima would come to watch a television serial with her because she had realized she did not want to be alone when the sister betrayed the sister again. Rima went with bread and an onion and a cheap bottle of red that had won prizes in a week when prizes were being generous, and they sat shoulder to shoulder on the couch and argued in whispers about the motives of people who did not exist. During the commercial breaks, Salma told stories about her own sister that she had not told before because they had been stored in a drawer marked too big, and Rima realized with the gentle shock that sometimes accompanied her mother\u2019s sentences that grief had made her mother kinder in a way no lecture could have taught. When she left, Salma pressed a bag of thyme into her hand and told her to eat stupidly in the morning and to try not to educate every hunger before satisfying it.\n\nMishmish appeared in her dreams sometimes now only as a temperature, a square of sun that moved over a floor and a sound of breath that straightened Rima\u2019s back even when she was not aware of slouching. In one dream, the tiger lay under an olive tree and the tree told her a joke about men who insist on holding umbrellas for you in rain that is not falling, and Rima laughed in her sleep and woke with her mouth open and her throat unafraid. She began to learn the names of the volunteers not because names were important for their own sake but because she liked the way men and women said their names when asked by a person who planned to remember, and she liked the way Karim said good when a bucket landed where it should and bad when it did not and nothing at all when the moment needed quiet. She tired of talking about the piece and learned to redirect the conversation toward the weather and the price of parsley and the rumor of a storm like a woman practiced in a polite martial art.\n\nThere were small humiliations and small glories and an afternoon when she found a note in her mailbox that said simply THANK YOU in a hand that was learning to grow up and a morning when she went to the pharmacy and was corrected by a girl ten years younger than her for mispronouncing the name of a cream. There was a day when the electricity did not come back when it said it would and she read by a window with her knees cold and there was a day when her upstairs neighbor practiced the oud for two hours and she forgave him for every missed note because the attempt filled a hole in the air that had been bothering her. There was a night when she took the long way home because there is a time in every life when one must take a street one has been avoiding and nothing happened and later she congratulated herself for swimming without water. She practiced wanting less attention and more endurance, which in her mouth felt like a reasonable prayer.\n\nThe city sent her a notice that she had been assigned a number for something she did not understand and she went to a building with chairs that had known the weight of five hundred kinds of impatience, and she waited with people who were both more important and less in a hierarchy that had nothing to do with the good. A woman with a child asleep on her lap told her a joke about stamps and they laughed as if stamps could hear and be shamed into good behavior, and when her number arrived on the screen in a red that demanded performance she walked to the window and was told that the system was down as if the system were a horse that had decided to sit. She went home and wrote a page about systems and horses and decided to cut it later, and then did not cut it because it lent a paragraph the spine that it had been pretending to grow.\n\nOn a Sunday that smelled like old bread being turned into something better, she took the bus to the edge of the city and walked the last kilometer along a road that held the ruins of cinemas and the new birth of small restaurants with chairs that would break within a year. She entered a building that had been a school before it was a clinic and listened to a woman explain how to volunteer with children who had learned to be louder than their parents to get noticed, and she wrote her name on a paper and felt the thrill of committing to a thing that might be boring. The woman smiled in a way that suggested relief that someone still believed paperwork could transform time into service, and handed her a schedule that made sense to her mouth. On the bus back she sat next to a boy eating chips with diligence and a man reading a book as if it had betrayed him and she rested her head against the window and let the city find its way back into her bones as if there had ever been a time it had not lived there.\n\nAt night, the generator hit its middle C and held it as if trying to calm a child, and she wrote a paragraph about care that did not attempt to be pretty and could therefore be trusted. She wrote about the small ways people make each other less lonely in this place without turning it into a parade, and she wrote about the ugliness that sometimes arrives when people decide to be necessary. She wrote about holding and releasing, about doorways and thresholds and rituals that do not ask permission from any flag, and she wrote down the sentence Salma had thrown across the kitchen like a braid: be offended and alive. She slept with the window open and let the city\u2019s breath lift the edge of her curtain, and when the dawn\u2019s first scooter cut through the street she was grateful like a woman who had survived a test she had not studied for and decided to forgive herself for the questions she had answered poorly.",

                              "content": "The heat retreated for a week as if it had remembered an appointment elsewhere, and in the pause the city revealed small things that July had kept hidden under its sweaty palm. The mountains began to admit out loud that they were green under the dust, and the sea had the uncomplicated confidence of a dog off its leash. Rima walked differently when the air loosened, not because relief should change your spine, but because it does. She took her mother\u2019s advice as if it were a vitamin she could dissolve under her tongue, and applied for the volunteer shift at the clinic, filling out a paper that had questions her body knew how to answer before her brain did. When she wrote her name in the square provided, she wrote it with the clean discipline of someone who had stopped wanting to see it everywhere.\n\nThe first day at the clinic, the room was a box painted a cheerful color that had known sadness and refused to let it be private. Tables had been pushed together to make islands, and pencils rolled off the edges and into hands that were used to catching things that tried to fall. The woman in charge was called Rasha and had a voice like a jacket that fit most people, and she introduced Rima as if she were a spoon, useful and ordinary and necessary. Twenty minutes later, six children held markers like weapons and declared that they would draw only monsters or only houses or only birds that had forgotten how to be afraid of people. Rima let them do it and did not tell them that tigers existed, because their monsters were complicated enough, and because she had promised herself that she would not feed her story to anyone who had not asked for a second serving.\n\nA girl named Mira\u2014who had a hairclip bitten into the shape of a star and a habit of measuring everything by the distance between her eyebrows and the person speaking\u2014drew a cat with teeth like triangles from a math book and then told Rima that the cat loved lemons. Another boy, Ayman, made a city out of squares and then colored the sky black because he had been reprimanded by a cousin for using blue on a Thursday once and had decided never to do it again. Rima asked them what they wanted to name a street and they named it after a teacher, and after a soccer player, and after a grandmother who had once stopped a car with her hand because it had offended her crossing. When they wrote small sentences under their drawings, Rima tried not to make suggestions that would turn those sentences into versions of herself, and she failed once or twice and recovered by keeping her mouth busy with agreeing noises instead of edits.\n\nOn the walk home, she passed a door that had been painted with flowers by a hand that had never seen a flower and still managed to get the insistence correct. A man sitting on a chair that belonged to the street asked if the clinic paid in cash or in gratitude and whether he could apply if it was the second, and she told him to try and he saluted her with an orange soda. She realized that for the first time in weeks she was not walking toward the cinema or away from it, and the relief had in it the faintest sting, because the room without the crate had become a map pinned to her ribs. She went anyway, because absence is a sculpture you should not leave in the dark too long, and stood where the square of pacing had gradually faded into the general rumor of concrete, and let that mild grief have a minute.\n\nHadi called to ask if she could sit in on a session where a man who had learned generosity in public and cruelty in private wanted to practice dull kindness. The request was specific in a way that made her respect him more than she had the day before, because good work has names for its parts. The men arrived in the wrong order and sat in chairs that had not been designed for the bodies they brought into the room, and Hadi stood with his hands in front of him as if carrying an invisible bowl that needed to be kept level. The man with the dimples who made women forgive him before he had asked them to spoke first and said he was exhausted by his own talent for escape, and the one who was built like a cupboard and had learned to store emotion rather than display it said he had begun to hate Thursday nights because there was too much expectation piled on top of a beer. Rima watched Hadi do the work of refusing to be their savior and instead be their calendar, and it made something behind her sternum stretch pleasantly and then warn her not to be simple.\n\nAfter the session a man lingered and told Rima a story about his mother making cheese by boiling milk until it became reason, and confessed that when she died he began to eat plastic-wrapped slices because grief had taught him to reject effort. Hadi walked her out and they leaned against a wall that had collected twenty years of conversations and agreed that men were children and women were children and everyone was a child and that judging that fact was less useful than planning nap times. He asked if she had written the paragraph about hands he had been waiting to read and when she said yes he kissed the top of her head without warning in the way a brother does when he remembers to be tender. She shoved him away gently and they grinned at their own competence at not complicating the moment, and then both of them fell quiet because the temptation had been there and naming it felt like letting a door blow shut.\n\nThe tiger became a rumor in the city\u2019s mouth rather than a headline, and Rima was grateful for the demotion. The iron door acquired new messages\u2014someone had drawn a fish large enough to swallow the word predator, and someone else had written a phone number and the words I CAN FIX ANY FAN, and below it a third person had added IF YOU CAN FIX MY MOTHER-IN-LAW YOU ARE A GENIUS. She took a photograph of the door because her memory had begun to misbehave in small ways and she wanted proof that cities are jokes told by committees, and she sent the photograph to Maya because editors can be rehabilitated into friends if everyone is careful. Maya sent back a sentence about doors being mouths and Rima rolled her eyes fondly and saved it for later theft.\n\nKarim called at an hour the hills consider private and asked in his straightforward voice if she could come up on Friday without asking questions on the phone. She said yes because people who manage animals with their hands seldom dramatize logistics unnecessarily, and because yes was the kind of obedience she had learned to enjoy in this context. On the road north, the air decided to be clean enough for her to smell what the factories contributed, and she found herself angry and fond in the same breath, which is to say she was loyal to the place. At the sanctuary, the light slipped between leaves the way a phrase slips between friends at a table without needing to make sense to everyone, and Karim met her at the gate with an expression that carried both pride and a request to be told he was wrong if he was wrong.\n\nMishmish had an abrasion on her shoulder that looked worse than it was, the result of a quarrel with a branch that had stood its ground. Karim had decided to encourage the animal to present it voluntarily to a hand and had a plan that involved patience and tuna and the careful management of who watched whom. He asked Rima not to speak for an hour, which was an insult she accepted gladly, and showed her where to stand so that the tiger could see her without feeling seen. The animal approached in arcs that would have embarrassed geometry teachers, and each time Karim did nothing until doing something would not be a betrayal. When the head came close enough that Rima could see the particular constellation of whisker-spots that had become her favorite proof of existence, she remembered the corridor and the iron door and the water made into bricks of ice, and she felt at the same time the arrogance of her old wanting and the sobriety of this new arrangement where her wanting had to be smaller than the animal\u2019s comfort. The tuna did its loyal work, which is to say it made everything easier without pretending to be holy, and Karim laid a hand briefly, a touch so light that it was barely an admission, and Rima did not cry because the economy of that contact forbade squandered reactions.\n\nOn the drive back she stopped at a roadside stand where figs were being lied about and could not decide which lie she preferred\u2014Rashaya or Tyre\u2014and bought both, which is a decision money will let you pretend is principled. The man selling them had the eyes of someone who had forgiven two sons and a brother and was now bored, and he asked if she had ever considered opening a shop because her face looked like it would do well with customers. She told him she had opened a whole building once and it had not gone well, and he told her he had once opened a marriage and it had done fine until it needed servicing, and the tone of the exchange made her laugh, which made him give her an extra two figs because men like to be rewarded for humor they did not plan.\n\nSalma\u2019s health made a small joke and then apologized for it. She fainted in the supermarket by the aisle with the olive oil and fell against a display of biscuits that scattered themselves like money, and when she came to she had one soft cookie in her hand and the certainty that the body can embarrass you in public and keep your dignity anyway. Rima met her at the clinic and watched a nurse half her age take her mother\u2019s blood pressure with the kind of seriousness that prevented Rima from making any jokes, and when a young doctor with a haircut that had been chosen by a mother said fulminations of dehydration, they nodded as if he had described a minor character in a soap opera. The bureaucracy wrapped them in its slow embrace and asked them to sit and then to stand and then to sit again from a different direction, and Rima filled a form for her mother because Salma had refused to wear her glasses because they were ugly, and she found that writing her mother\u2019s date of birth on a paper she would not keep made her feel strangely proprietary about the way time passed through that body.\n\nThey bought the prescribed water and salt and sugar as if they were ingredients for a dessert and took a taxi home because sometimes taxis were better than the bus when the day had already taken more than its fair share and you were in no mood to measure yourself against the city's arithmetic. In the kitchen, lemon halves sat like witnesses again while Salma insisted on making a dish that required more attention than a body should give after falling, and Rima did not argue because the hierarchy here was ancient and the stove could be its altar. When Salma sat down finally, she told a story about a cousin who had fainted in a wedding dress and been so grateful for the excuse to sit that she had fallen again in the same place the next day, and they laughed not because they were cruel but because the story had been told to them at exactly the right time.\n\nThe boy with the camera appeared at the cinema wearing a shirt that had been ironed so enthusiastically it had become a different shirt, and told Rima that he had been offered an internship at a paper that pretended to be more important than it was and that he might take it because he had discovered that being poor was wasting his good angles. He asked if he could write about the tiger without telling people where she was and whether he should mention her name and whether if he did his mother would stop thinking he was unserious, and Rima told him that he could write about the thing he had seen as long as he did not use it as a mirror for his feelings unless he did it better than most people did. He promised to try and she believed him because believing boys when they promised to try was a muscle she exercised carefully but regularly, and she told him that if the paper edited his piece until it became a stranger he should print it himself on bad paper and hang it in his kitchen and make people read it before he allowed them to sit.\n\nThe landlord\u2019s sister began to put rugs in the corridor and rules on the door and told Rima that slippers were required because bare feet carried gossip into private spaces. She arranged six plants like a congregation and watered them with a measuring cup in a way that made Rima fear for their will to live, and when Rima suggested that plants preferred neglect to suffocation the woman made a face that suggested she doubted experts and had a PhD in household convictions. Abu Fadi watched the two of them with the glee of a man watching two cats negotiate a map and warned his sister, in the voice of a man who had learned not to step directly into the road unless prepared to be run over, that Rima\u2019s rules were already written on the wall of the city. In the end, they negotiated a ceasefire where the plants would be allowed and the slippers suggested and the corridor would be swept every other day by anyone who found it dirty first, which in practice meant Rima most mornings because she woke earlier than most people in the building and hated stepping over crumbs.\n\nMaya asked her to write a column that would exist once a month and not apologize to itself for starting fresh each time, and Rima asked for permission to sometimes write about nothing and was surprised when the answer was yes. She wrote the first about ironing, and about the way heat and pressure\u2014applied to cloth or to a story\u2014could be either an act of care or of cruelty depending on the wrist. She confessed that she did not iron and would always rather hang something near a window and let the weather and time collaborate, and then she wrote a sentence about her father ironing his shirts while watching soccer with the sound off because commentary is a form of invasion, and she kept the sentence when she had the urge to cut it because cutting would have been an act of cowardice disguised as perfectionism. The column landed quietly like a plate in a kitchen that is already loud, and three women wrote to tell her that they ironed only when their mothers visited, and one man wrote to say that he ironed everything because his mother had not visited in twenty years.\n\nGhida, whose room had begun to feel like a country with rules you could respect without having to pledge allegiance to anything, asked Rima what she had wanted to say to her father for a decade and had not, and when Rima said she wanted to ask him if he had loved exactly one person in his life fiercely and whether that person had been a woman or a version of himself that had played tennis, Ghida nodded as if the ridiculousness of the question was not an offense but a requirement. Rima went to the graveyard on a morning that smelled like rain had insulted a rock and placed a bottle of water near the stone because she could not bear to come empty-handed, and she spoke aloud knowing that stones do not answer but they do witness. She told upturned dust that she had done a ridiculous thing and returned it to its proper place, and that she had learned that proper places are sentences that need to be negotiated constantly, and she thanked a man who could not hear for the three rules he had given her: do not look at the ball, do not look at yourself, swing. Then she sat on a low wall and refused to narrate her own sincerity because some scenes die under the weight of language.\n\nA storm threatened and then decided it preferred the next valley and left the city with fast clouds and a mood. The second checkpoint acquired a new soldier who was not good at his job in the way that made him kind because he did not know yet where he was supposed to be cruel. Noura lost a battle with a map and won something more important with a phone call that made three men bend in three offices, and she sent Rima a photograph of a tortoise who had decided to be a philosopher and a monkey who had decided to be a thief of pens. Karim sent a message that simply read rain came and we found out where the roof was lying about itself, and Rima sent back a promise of money because promises are how people who are not physically present pretend to be helpful. She went to see Uncle Sami at the ice place because loyalty is a map too, and bought a small bag of ice even though the weather did not require it, and listened to him talk about a niece who had taken a job in a country where people did not shout and had written home that the quiet hurt her ears.\n\nAt the clinic, Ayman apologized to his Thursday rules and used blue for sky and then felt guilty and asked Rima if he had betrayed his cousin. She told him that color was not the kind of fidelity anyone should be testing, and he thought about it and drew a bicycle with the perspective all wrong and told her the man who sold the bicycle refused to believe that the boy buying it had not stolen the money, and she asked him to write that down and he did in letters that were all elbows. Mira decided that the lemon-cat deserved a friend and drew a bird with teeth and wrote under it that it only ate seeds because teeth were a decoration and not a plan, and Rima told her she should get paid for the sentence one day. When she walked from the clinic to the bus, she saw three men unsuccessfully pretending not to like the rain and one woman successfully pretending not to like the rain, and she took a picture of the pavement because the tiny puddles had become her favorite city\u2014clear, bordered, temporary.\n\nHadi and she made a new practice of swimming very early when the beach was half-empty and the lifeguards were bleary-eyed and kind. They did not talk much in the water because breath has better uses there, and when they sat after in the warm with coffee he told her that his father had begun to make jokes again and he did not know if this meant he was healing or cowering. She told him that laughter could be both a rock and a river, and he told her that sentence was ugly and probably true, and that Ghida had asked him to try not laughing for an hour in his next session and he was terrified of discovering that everything he said without laughter was a complaint. They planned a small celebration for his first five paying clients and decided to call it a lunch and not a ceremony because men deserve to be fed rather than applauded, and because Lebanon had spent too much applause on the wrong afternoons.\n\nThe cousin of the cinema owner persisted with his letters, and in one he included an invoice for air that had been, in his opinion, consumed excessively by Rima and her fans. Abu Fadi responded by installing a small sign in the lobby that read AIR FREE TODAY ONLY and took a photograph of it and sent it to the cousin and to Rima with a string of laughing emojis that looked like pills. Rima printed the photograph and taped it above her desk to remind herself to be stupid in public occasionally, and she wrote a paragraph that began with the absurdity and ended with a serious thought about the commons. Maya told her to move it from the beginning to the sixth paragraph and to stop hiding her thesis in jokes and to risk earnestness earlier, and Rima sulked for an hour and then did it and the piece grew bones where previously there had been cartilage.\n\nIn the sanctuary, a hyena arrived with eyes like long questions and a history that had to be discovered backwards. Karim showed Rima how an animal names its square by stepping into it with the same foot first, and how patience is a verb with teeth, and how even the laziest afternoon can require the full strength of two hands if you are doing it right. She watched him teach a young volunteer how to hold a bucket as if it were fragile when it was made of plastic and then explain that everything should be handled that way, not because it might break but because it might resist being used. When she told him he sounded like a book he said he had never liked books because they stayed where you left them, and she told him that some of them moved at night and he made the particular face men make when forced to admit they have been charmed against their will.\n\nThe boy with the camera wrote his piece and it appeared in a column that had once mattered and still pretended to, and it was good enough to make Rima jealous and respectful in equal measure. He did not mention names and he did not claim knowledge he did not possess, and he stopped the piece at exactly the right place and did not add a sentimental sentence about hope, which made her want to buy him a pair of shoes. He came to see her with the paper folded to his paragraph and a look on his face like a person who has found a coin on the ground that turned out to be gold-plated, and she told him to keep the clipping in a book and not on his wall so that only thieves of books would steal it. He said the editor had asked him to find a second animal and he had said no, and she told him he had saved himself three bad years with that one small refusal.\n\nSalma\u2019s neighbor\u2019s forgetting began to invite strangers into their hallway in the form of cousins with opinions, and Rima practiced the art of smiling at people whose presence made the apartment smaller. She learned to avoid the hours when the kitchen became a parliament and instead brought food at times when chewing would interrupt debate, and she learned that three people could get through an awkward afternoon by shelling peas, and she learned that if you sing three lines badly and then repeat them you can put a sorrow to sleep temporarily. Salma herself rediscovered flirting with life, which is to say she bought new curtains with flowers that were too big and scolded them for being showy and hung them anyway, and she informed Rima that she would not attend any event where people clapped for her daughter because clapping made her nervous, but that she would stand near the door and take in the air like a participant.\n\nThe city\u2019s light shifted into its autumn shape and the evenings became a way of forgiving the day for what it had done. The Corniche filled with men who declared that cold had arrived while being wrong and with women who refused to bring sweaters out of principle, and the fishermen pretended not to notice tourists pretending to know anything about fish. The iron door acquired a new piece of graffiti in a tender hand that read WE ARE TIRED OF BEING BRAVE TRY BEING SAFE FOR A WEEK, and Rima did not paint over it because it sounded like a prayer a person who had run out of the proper ones might try. She traced the curve of the S with her thumb as if it would fix something, and then she went upstairs and wrote about a day when safety had been an unremarkable noun, and she sent it to Maya and Maya wrote back that the unremarkable is the only revolution she believed in this year.\n\nWhen the storm finally came, it came with a stance, shoulders square, hands open, as if ready to argue anyone out of their sunshine. Trees popped with the sound of equalities asserted and then broken, and the street briefly became a river where cigarette butts swam bravely before drowning. The ceiling of the back room at the cinema revealed a line of betrayal, and Rima arranged bowls under it as if placing instruments in an orchestra and listened to their different pitches with a satisfaction that felt inappropriate but was not, because the music meant she could act. She called the number under I CAN FIX ANY FAN and a man arrived with a toolbox and a temper and looked at the leak like a personal insult, and he climbed a ladder with the grace of an old acrobat and made it stop long enough for the storm to forget to insist.\n\nAfter the storm, the city did what it always did after deciding to live through another indignity: it dried its hair in the sun and pretended it had never been bothered. The clinic was full of children who had discovered puddles and learned to jump without the permission of any adult, and Rasha had to pretend to scold them because the floor had become a map of wet footprints that would turn into a hazard if not admired briefly and then removed. Mira drew a bird that had decided to wear a raincoat and gave it a name too long to fit under the picture, and Ayman tried to describe thunder without using the word thunder and failed beautifully. Rima took their pages home and put them in a folder marked Stories That Do Not Ask For Me, and she felt the sweetness of keeping things that did not need her to make sense.\n\nHadi\u2019s group learned to sit without filling silences with weather, and a man who had never spoken about his divorce because his preferred story about himself did not include any acts of being left said slowly that he had been told to be strong and had decided to be useful instead, and that this had ended badly for everyone. They sat with that until the clock demanded they pay attention to it instead, and after the session Hadi and Rima ate shawarma standing up because stools are timid furniture and some decisions are best made while leaning. He told her that he had turned down a client who wanted him to help with a speech to impress investors because he had asked what the man wanted out of life and the man had said applause, and Rima put her hand on the back of his neck briefly because it was a part of the body that respects small encouragements, and then she removed it because the air between them was theirs and she did not want to spend it improperly.\n\nNight returned to being evidence rather than a threat, and Rima found that she could read after nine without her mind staging a small refusal. She opened a book of letters between two women who had died before Lebanon taught her to count time in outages and admired the way they were unashamed of loving each other\u2019s sentences. She made tea that tasted like a compromise between mint and the idea of mint, and she wrote a paragraph about repair that did not try to be larger than the objects it described. She thought briefly of the tiger and then did not, which felt like progress and also like disloyalty, and she allowed herself to believe that both could be true and she could be permitted to sleep.\n\nThe next morning, she woke to the smell of bread that was not her own and realized that the landlord\u2019s sister had baked manakish in a pan that had seen battle and was now a veteran, and the woman had placed one at Rima\u2019s door with a note that read SORRY FOR THE RUGS I WILL REDUCE THEM BY ONE. Rima took the bread and warmed it and ate it with her fingers because food wants to be touched, and she stood at the threshold chewing and thinking that the world would be easier if every apology arrived with thyme. She went back to her desk, opened the document titled In Care Of, and wrote, for the first time without hesitation, a page that began not with a tiger or with a mother or with a man who had learned to be a different kind of useful, but with a towel hung carefully on a chair to dry in a room where a leak had been persuaded to pause. She wrote until the generator decided to flirt with her anger again, and then she wrote a little more in the dark because stubbornness can be as holy as a plan when you are honest about it.",
