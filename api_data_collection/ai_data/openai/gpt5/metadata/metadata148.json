     "novel_text": "The city creaked awake under a sky like a stretched bedsheet, blue and cold at the edges and pale where the sun pressed its hand through. A dew-slicked truck idled behind the municipal building, coughing a ribbon of white that the wind shredded and sent along 1A toward the trees. Inside, lights hummed their quiet neon hums, and a man with a mop and a knack for humming along ran the mop head under the tap and shook it mostly dry. The floor, the glass, the tiny constellation of crumbs under every chair\u2014these were the universe right now. Spruce Grove at five-thirty was a kingdom of keys and the soft squeak of rubber soles. Not romantic, but then some romances are slow.\n\nOwen Halvorsen worked in splotches of concentration. He could focus so hard that the clock failed to move, or he could drift and find himself an hour lighter without a clue what path his thoughts took. He liked being first in a place, liked the rawness. The night janitor had left him notes on pink paper: Missed corner behind the filing cabinet, sorry. Coffee exploded in the second-floor corridor AGAIN. God bless the woman who drew three smiley faces to soften the facts. He smiled back in his head and took his bucket, wet as a lake with soap water and the smell that promised citrus and probably killed very small organisms in shock.\n\nAs he worked, he considered pies. This was an old habit, like pocketing bottle caps and turning them over to see what they hide, or whistling without meaning to. Pies were circles. Pies were decisions made with hands and heat and timing so precise a whole afternoon could go wrong because you blinked. Pies were comfort and competition and the time he\u2019d won a ribbon at a charity event because he could eat a blueberry pie faster than any of fourteen men and three brave women with faces adorned in purple like war paint. That was two summers ago. He could still taste the berries. He could still feel the wild, childish grin when the crowd clapped for nothing more profound than a man finishing something he started.\n\n\u201cThere he is,\u201d said Inez, materializing in the hallway like a ghost in a beige cardigan. She moved as though the building were her instrument and she played it quietly. \u201cAlready in your gospels, Owen? The Book of Mop?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say that like mop isn\u2019t sacred work,\u201d he said. It might have been, depending on the day. Some days he loved the way a dull tile could be convinced to shine. Some days his wrists ached and everything felt last on the list. He wasn\u2019t twenty anymore, wasn\u2019t fifty either, but the clock had teeth.\n\nInez peeked into his bucket. \u201cThat water looks like Old Man Winter let his dog in. When\u2019s your break?\u201d\n\n\u201cTen minutes,\u201d Owen said. \u201cGot all the glass to do first. The city likes seeing itself in its own reflection.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always had a mouth on you,\u201d she said, but warmly. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to eat. You\u2019re a hanger.\u201d\n\n\u201cHanger?\u201d He knew, but she liked saying her words.\n\n\u201cA hangry man. A hanger. It\u2019s not the worst thing to be.\u201d She patted his arm and drifted toward the council chambers, smoothing a plastic runner like it was a silk sheet in a hotel no one could afford. \u201cYou hear there\u2019s some kind of fair next weekend? Out by the ball diamonds. Music and booths and a petting goat, I imagine. I\u2019ll knit that goat a sweater if someone gives me ten bucks.\u201d\n\n\u201cPetting zoo at the community fair. That\u2019s real.\u201d He\u2019d seen the flyer, only it wasn\u2019t the goat that had caught him. It was the photo of a pie with the crust crimped like a careful child\u2019s art project, edges pinched so perfectly they looked machine-made.\n\n\u201cOh, and they\u2019re doing a pie thing,\u201d Inez said, as if she\u2019d plucked the thought from behind his ear. \u201cEat until your stomach sues for divorce. You going to show them how it\u2019s done?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Owen said. He tried to sound casual. He felt like a schoolboy with a note burning in his pocket.\n\nHe worked the squeegee down the glass doors and watched the sun change the town from suggestion to detail. The parking lot gathered cars; a man in an orange vest stacked cones like the start of a great and temporary monument. A woman with a clipboard scolded her phone. He liked being apart from it, but not too far. The mop water went down the drain like a promise fulfilled. He ate his sandwich at ten exactly in the break room, the sugar packet someone had spilled under the kettle glittering like a corsage for the floor, and he Googled \u201cSpruce Grove pie eating contest rules\u201d on his will-of-the-wisp cell service. He found the fair\u2019s page, with fonts that suggested enthusiasm but screamed budget. Qualifiers Thursday night at the community arena. Finals Sunday. Waiver required. No hands allowed. No puking. Cleanup provided. The prize: a ribbon, a trophy shaped like a pie slice, and a cash envelope that would make a small dent on a credit card bill. It wasn\u2019t about the envelope. It never really was.\n\nIt was about being seen, his mother would say if she were still phoning him in the mornings. But she wasn\u2019t, and sometimes that silence made more noise in him than anything else. His father, a quieter man, still called on Sundays and inquired about the weather like the weatherman\u2019s script and then slowly sketched out the real talk, the worries, the small glories. Dad would not be impressed by a pie trophy. But he would come and clap, because that\u2019s what fathers like his do. He\u2019d clap once at first, politely, and then when he thought he was alone on the second clap he\u2019d let it be a cheering sort of clap, too many claps for a man of his reserved nature. Owen could see it. He could hear the old man\u2019s truck rocking on the gravel as they left, his dad saying, \u201cWell, there\u2019s something you can tell your grandchildren when you have any, which you absolutely will if you stop judging women based on their pie opinions.\u201d\n\nHe laughed out loud at nothing, startling Inez, who peered at him over a stack of municipal notices like a prairie owl.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t fall down in that giggle fit,\u201d she said.\n\nHe didn\u2019t.\n\nHe finished his shift at two with a soreness he catalogued as manageable. He clocked out and shrugged into his denim jacket because evenings even in June could be a trick, a tease, a last-cold breath. The Blue Spruce Bakery was three blocks down and implicitly part of his route home. He didn\u2019t have to stop, but he always did. The window had a hand-painted tree that someone with more confidence than skill had done, the needles a little too bright. Inside, the smell convinced you good choices existed and could be eaten with a fork.\n\nMira was behind the counter with her hair in a knot that said she had fought with it and won. She had a face that gave away her reactions in an honest way, like a good book with the last page missing.\n\n\u201cYou again,\u201d she said, squinting, which he had learned meant she was pleased to see him but refused to make a big deal out of it.\n\n\u201cMe again.\u201d He tapped the glass case. \u201cThat one. The\u2014what is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cSaskatoon berry,\u201d she said, handing him a paper bag as if by magic. He hadn\u2019t seen her reach for anything. She moved as if the bakery were her body and the cinnamon twists were fingers she fidgeted.\n\nHe paid in coins as he often did because something in him liked the sound. It was old-fashioned and he knew it. She counted the coins with the rhythm of someone who had done this in high school at a craft fair when no one was watching.\n\n\u201cWhy do you come here when it\u2019s clear you\u2019re a Tim\u2019s man?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear?\u201d He held up his coffee like a man caught at a crime.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear from your eyes, which are glassier than any normal person. That is not quality brew,\u201d she said, and slid him a wink and a small chocolate cookie he hadn\u2019t ordered.\n\n\u201cI like both,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m entering a pie-eating contest. I need to survey the field.\u201d\n\nShe leaned across the counter. It made an almost-private place for his words. \u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look like\u2026\u201d She waved a hand in a way that might have been an apology.\n\n\u201cI know. But you don\u2019t have to be a tank to eat pie fast. You have to have technique. You have to have heart.\u201d He said it to make her laugh. It was only half a joke.\n\nShe bit her lip like she was trying to not smile, and failed. \u201cWell, heart. Okay. Where is this happening?\u201d\n\n\u201cCommunity arena. Thursday night. They do the qualis. Finals Sunday at the fairgrounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll make it,\u201d she said, as if it were as easy as paying rent. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a look. Like\u2014\u201d She squinted again. \u201cLike the guy nobody bets on. Not an insult. They will cry later when they see your secret ninja gut.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not tell my gut you said that. He\u2019s sensitive,\u201d Owen said. They traded the paper bag and a second joke and the impression of fourteen others unsaid. What a piece of fluff. What a relief.\n\nThat evening he jogged, badly, along the path that skirted the pond where ducks made meetings of huge importance and teenagers carved new names into old wood. He ran a lap, then another while a country song on someone\u2019s radio did its job. There were rules in the event that took the fun out and gave the fun back: no water after the start, no hands, lean over the plate, chew enough not to obstruct, a judge-making faces at you if you tried to cheat with smear tactics. He had learned things from internet experts: chew in rhythm. Work the crust first. Fruit pies go easier than meat; meat clogs you up and turns your face the exact shade of regret. He tried breathing patterns while he ran. In through the nose. Out through the mouth. He felt stupid and no one noticed.\n\nThursday arrived like a dare.\n\nHis boss Darlene\u2019s office was a glitch of plants and a stapler that had seen wars. She had a stack of time-off requests most of which looked like letters to the editor written by people who had very strong opinions. She had also a heart as surprising as it was matter-of-fact, if that made sense. \u201cSo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need Sunday off. Exchange shift or whatever.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nShe peered at him. She had the kind of eyes that saw things you hadn\u2019t learned yet. \u201cIt\u2019s your fair. Go eat pie. Don\u2019t come in here Monday with your face blue and ask me for hazard pay. But seriously. Have fun. You don\u2019t take enough days.\u201d\n\n\u201cI take a Saturday every week.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 not how weeks work, Halvorsen.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\nHe left with a promise to text if he were detained by glory.\n\nThe community arena had fluorescent lights that made everyone look like the winter version of themselves. The echo of his steps reminded him of being ten and afraid of nothing except a ball coming at his nose. People gathered in small clusters among the folding chairs and the booths selling kettle corn and homemade jams decorated with gingham that no one had asked for and everyone expected. A sign said PIE EATING QUALIFIERS in letters that wanted more ink than the marker had left.\n\n\u201cContestants check in here,\u201d said a teenager with a bored professionalism he admired. His name tag said BRAYDEN with the Y underlined twice like an inside joke. He passed Owen a form that said he wouldn\u2019t sue anyone if his esophagus made a decision on its own. Owen signed it with the flourish of someone who hadn\u2019t signed anything interesting since the lease. His number was 11, which he decided he liked.\n\nBeside him a mountain moved and it turned out to be a man. Red beard, shoulders like a couch, hands with muscle memory for lifting either weights or whole cows. He had a laugh like someone dropping a toolbox into another toolbox. \u201cFirst time?\u201d he asked and it sounded like he was asking how the weather was.\n\n\u201cSecond,\u201d Owen said. \u201cLocal one two summers ago. Charity thing. It was\u2026 organized.\u201d\n\nThe big man gave a knowing nod. \u201cBrick,\u201d he said, by way of his name being Brick. \u201cFrom down the road in Stony.\u201d\n\n\u201cOwen,\u201d he said. They shook. Brick\u2019s hand was not for show. \u201cYou\u2019ve done this before.\u201d\n\n\u201cA few times,\u201d Brick said. \u201cAnd yet I keep coming back. You\u2019d think a man would learn. You got any tricks?\u201d\n\n\u201cChew in threes,\u201d Owen said, surprising himself.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s cute,\u201d Brick said, not mean. \u201cMy trick is don\u2019t die.\u201d\n\nA small, birdlike older guy prowled past them in a blazer he couldn\u2019t possibly afford, speaking into a walkie like it was the last walkie on earth. \u201cWhere\u2019s my cranberry? Where\u2019s my blueberry? Who stole my rhubarb? Team two is delayed, we\u2019re delayed, we\u2019re fine. Smile. Smile.\u201d His expression suggested he had never smiled on purpose. He was a human who had lived most of his life next to a megaphone.\n\nWhen they called number 11, Owen\u2019s chest rattled. The stage was not a stage. It was a long table with six plates and six pies and a tarp on the floor that would later be folded into itself like false modesty. The judge, a man with a clipboard and a face that wanted to be somewhere else, explained the rules again. The crowd was not large but it made noise in the manner of a larger crowd. Some nights you get applause that forgives things you haven\u2019t done yet. He tipped his baseball cap backward and stepped up to his plate.\n\nBlueberry. He had hoped. It stained, but it went down in a willing manner.\n\n\u201cHands behind your backs,\u201d the judge said, cheerfully enough. \u201cOn three.\u201d\n\nHe set his elbows on the table to anchor, shuffled his feet into fighter\u2019s stance though he would never fight for any reason but to end a fight, and on three he went down like an old time boxer with a plan.\n\nThe pastry scratched his top palate. He did the tongue thing he had practiced, pushing crust parts to the side, slurping filling in small vacuums of sound, forming bites with his teeth that would not get him in trouble with his own throat. It wasn\u2019t pretty. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be. He found the rhythm in his jaw. He let the crowd be a blur and the judge\u2019s whistle be a suggestion. He tilted his head and the pie followed, sliding like a hillside in the rain. He smiled into the tin, which surprised him; who smiles into a pie tin? He had to breathe; he breathed. He got crumbs in his nose and didn\u2019t panic. He kept going even when the man at number 9 made a gagging sound that scared a mother in the front row. He kept going even when his brain told him this was ridiculous and he should be ashamed of himself and also more ashamed for believing this mattered. He kept going because\u2014why stop? Because we stop so often for no good reason, and here was a reason to keep moving your mouth and your heart and then a slice later he was done.\n\nHe was done before number 9, more or less at the same breath as number 4. Brick at number 12 thumped the table with a hollow boom of completion and shooting stars of blueberry rose up like confetti. The judge called times in a bored voice that made the numbers more holy. Owen had not won the heat; that went to Brick by a tick and a half. He did not expect his legs to feel like kelp. They did.\n\nMira materialized at the edge of the stage like a fairy godmother if a godmother wore flour on her jeans. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that was you,\u201d she said, and laughed and pressed a napkin at his chin. \u201cBlue beard.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou came,\u201d he said, which had been the hope he had stuffed into his sock.\n\n\u201cI closed early,\u201d she said, not looking at him when she said it, because she was not sure how that would land in either of their chests. \u201cIt gets slow after six anyway. Also, my landlord is in that audience and I would like him to see me and remember I exist when I ask for the plumbing to be less enthusiastic.\u201d\n\nThey called out names and numbers, and the man in the blazer turned his face into a cheer. \u201cAdvancing to Sunday,\u201d he said, \u201cwe have our group one qualifiers: number 4\u2026 number 11\u2026 and number 12!\u201d\n\nThe crowd clapped. Someone who didn\u2019t know where to put their energy whooped. Owen\u2019s name sounded strange under the arena lights, like when your own voice comes back from a canyon. He lifted a sticky hand and then lowered it quickly when he remembered where that hand had just been. The moment was larger in his head than it looked in the air, but it existed, and he put it in his pocket, safe.\n\nBackstage, which was only a curtain hanging a little crooked, Brick whistled low. \u201cYou\u2019re dangerous,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m decent,\u201d Owen said.\n\n\u201cYou moved like you had a plan. That\u2019s rare, around here. Mostly it\u2019s dudes with hubris and dental insurance. Sunday will be a field, though. People come out of the woods for finals. You ever met Cannon?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll know him when you see him. He\u2019s the one with the fan club. And the foam finger his girlfriend made that says \u2018Chomp.\u2019 Ridiculous. You hungry?\u201d\n\n\u201cI just ate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not food,\u201d Brick said. \u201cThat is performance art and regret tomorrow morning.\u201d\n\nThey laughed. It wasn\u2019t friendship, not yet, but it was league membership. Mira waited by the exit, the late June evening dragging stripes of peach and lavender across the horizon like a painter who got lost in the color section.\n\n\u201cYou were good,\u201d she said. \u201cGood-good. Not just for a guy from here. Good.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d He wiped his face again. Blue persisted in crevices he had not known he owned. \u201cThere were some older ladies in front who weren\u2019t quite sure what they were applauding for.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey came for the quilt raffle and stayed for the bloodsport,\u201d Mira said. \u201cYour input?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring them muffins to apologize,\u201d he said, and then felt at once like he was joking and not. \u201cSunday. You\u2019ll be there?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the pipes behave,\u201d she said, and made a face. \u201cAnyway, congrats. Your fan club can\u2019t afford foam fingers, but\u2014\u201d She lifted her hand and wiggled her fingers in the air, shaking them like seaweed in a current. \u201cJazz hands.\u201d\n\nHe got home to his apartment that smelled like garlic no matter what he did. His neighbor in 301 had invented a new way to burn toast. He showered in water that couldn\u2019t decide if it wanted to scald or sulk. He called his father, because some things held you up by their mere existence, and said, \u201cI got into the finals,\u201d and his father said, \u201cOf what,\u201d and then \u201cOh,\u201d in that careful neutral that meant he was deciding whether this was one of those calls where he should pretend to be thrilled or where he could breathe and be honest. Owen helped him by keeping it simple.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come,\u201d his father said. \u201cI\u2019ll clap. And I\u2019ll tell you it isn\u2019t food. But I\u2019ll clap.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Owen said. \u201cI know it isn\u2019t\u2026 anything big. It\u2019s the principle.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of life is principle,\u201d his father said and laughed. \u201cThat and keeping your receipts. Drink water. I don\u2019t understand why, but I think it\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nHe went to bed early and didn\u2019t sleep because the nervous little animal that lives beneath a man\u2019s ribs needed to run. He dreamed the dumb dream where you\u2019re on stage and you realize you\u2019ve forgotten to put on pants and the stage is a pie crust. He woke laughing and then sat on the edge of the bed with his head in his hands and let the laugh turn into something like a prayer.\n\nFriday crawled. Saturday he did not train because he listened to a video online that told him rest is training too and he let that be true. He ate something green and something white and something brown and wished for a diagram that told him in percentages what each thing did once it got in there. He cleaned a dentist\u2019s office after hours and felt a weird surge of solidarity with the tools lined up like silver toys. He told Inez, who told him good luck as if he were leaving to sail around the world on a canoe.\n\nSunday he wore his shirt with the least suspicious stain. He laced his shoes like he\u2019d be asked to run. The fairgrounds had grown a fair since Thursday. Tents blossomed; the air had a growl to it, generators working. The scent of onion and sugar and dust was old-school and undeniable. The stage for the finals was an actual stage, with an actual banner that did not blow off in the first breeze. The emcee was the blazer man who had found a second blazer. He held his mic like an extension of his nervous system.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, and anyone and everyone in between or beyond, welcome to the Spruce Grove Summer Days Pie Eating Finals!\u201d he yodeled. \u201cGet your stomachs right and your hands off these pies. The rules are posted. The pies are partly forgiving. The judges are fair. The cleanup crew is\u2014brave.\u201d\n\nOwen met the other finalists behind the stage where a volunteer gave them small bottles of water and said, \u201cNot after you hit the plate,\u201d in a tone that suggested she had lost at least one wet sneaker to a man who forgot. Cannon introduced himself simply by existing, a blonde block of a man with a smile he\u2019d practiced in the mirror. His girlfriend did indeed have a foam finger. It did indeed say CHOMP. Brick rolled his eyes so hard it was audible. \u201cDon\u2019t let them get in your head,\u201d he said, not exactly quiet.\n\n\u201cThey make shirts,\u201d Cannon said, overhearing without taking offense. \u201cIf they make shirts you can sell them online, and then my boss gets off my case about hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a business plan,\u201d Brick said. \u201cI respect it, I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is more than your gut will respect you after this,\u201d Cannon said and thumped Brick on his back in a gesture that almost knocked him into next week.\n\nMira found Owen as a volunteer tied a bib around his neck, a ridiculous accessory that did exactly what it was supposed to do. \u201cBreak a leg,\u201d she said, and then her face went thoughtful. \u201cNot that. Break\u2026 a record. Break a\u2026 pie. Don\u2019t break anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nHe was not sure. He was.\n\nThe first pie was saskatoon berry. It crumbled differently than blueberry, a skitter of seeds he didn\u2019t hate. The second pie was apple, which had that baked bite that required more chewing and thus more precision than a man wanted in such a situation. The third was\u2014pecan? He raised his head, and the judge\u2019s eyebrow did a thing that said, Be grateful, son. He readjusted his strategy mid-chew, which is a ridiculous sentence and also exactly what he did.\n\nBrick was steady, Cannon was fast. Owen found that his rhythm from Thursday came back like a song you liked too much to forget. He could see nothing but his plate, and in his peripheral the toe of someone\u2019s shoe that had a hole in it, and beyond that something like the roof of the world. It was absurd and he recognized that in real time. It was also as real as anything. He leaned, he chomped, he breathed. He thought of his father\u2019s small smile, Mira\u2019s jazz hands, Inez and her knitted goat sweater. He thought of his mother adjusting a table runner, because she would, and telling him not to be ridiculous but making sure the sun fell on his plate just so.\n\nHe made it through the second pie in good standing. He had time. He was going to possibly\u2014he didn\u2019t let his head go there. Focus is a room with no windows.\n\nHalfway through the third, his mouth did something he didn\u2019t ask it to do, a small gag sound like an uninvited violin in a punk band. He breathed through. He saw the judge notch something on his clipboard that might have been a judge version of a prayer. He dug in again, slower, and Brick came level and then past him by a half-lap around the tin. Cannon had jam all over his nose and joy all over his face. The crowd made a noise like a collective knee being knocked against a table.\n\nHe did not win. He did not come second. He came third, and the emcee threw his arm around Cannon and declared him a legend, and confetti made of paper and regret fell, and someone in the front row clapped with two hands and a foot, and it was all more than and less than he had imagined it might be.\n\nOwen did not mind. Or he minded in a way that did not damage his day. He wiped his face and looked for Mira because that was what his eyes wanted. She was there, half-smile in place, her eyes a little warmer than the air. Brick shook his hand and squeezed. \u201cYou\u2019ll get them next year,\u201d he said, which was a kindness and also a way to say what else are we doing but coming back to try again with a different shirt.\n\n\u201cNice work,\u201d Cannon said, and meant it. \u201cYour chew in threes? I saw that. I like a method man.\u201d\n\nHe laughed and let the laugh stay. The emcee handed out ribbons and the trophy to Cannon, who kissed it like it had a mouth. People milled. The generator whined. The sun did what it does in June and refused to go to bed on time. Owen took his participation certificate and folded it into quarters that were ungently neat and then remembered he was supposed to wear his ribbon for the photos and tried to untangle it like he was in a romantic comedy with a shoelace.\n\nIt came to him with the force of a clear sky that he was okay. That\u2019s a stupid sentence, and so what.\n\nHe sat on the edge of a hay bale that was exactly wrong for sitting and chewed his lip and thought what a deliciously odd path this was, from a bucket and a mop to here with blueberry under his nails and a small soft light in his chest. He thought of calling his father and saying third, old man, your boy got a bronze in something your wife would have laughed all morning about. He thought he\u2019d text Inez a picture of his blue stained grin. He thought he\u2019d take Mira out for ice cream and talk about anything else.\n\n\u201cIs it crass to sell pies here?\u201d Mira asked, dropping down beside him, two spoons and one dish in her hand like a dare and a gift.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exactly right,\u201d he said, and took a bite and winced when cold stabbed his forehead and then he laughed at himself for being the person who can eat three pies in ten minutes and loses his mind over a single lick of ice cream.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s to dignity,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd to losing it,\u201d he said.\n\nThey clinked their plastic spoons like wine glasses and when the emcee shouted into his mic about a lost child named Lucas who was not lost anymore, the crowd applauded as if Lucas had conquered a mountain. Maybe he had. Maybe finding your mother in a crowd when everything is taller than you is a kind of Everest. Owen\u2019s phone buzzed and his father\u2019s text read, Simply\u2014saw you on the livestream, your aunt sent the link. Proud. You looked like your grandfather. He wiped his eyes with the back of his hand and blamed the wind.\n\nOn the walk back to his car, he passed the cotton candy machine spinning sugar into clouds and the tired men at the ring toss resetting rings like sins forgiven. He passed a poster for a community theater production and another for a blood drive. Life intersected with itself and made a pattern that did not make sense up close, only stepping back. He could already feel tomorrow\u2019s stiffness. He could already feel the need, gentle but present, to return to mops and glass and the corners you miss when your head is somewhere else. There was relief in that. There was the comfort of a list.\n\n\u201cHey, Halvorsen,\u201d someone called, and he turned and Brick jogged up, every step heavy and solid, like a promise that didn\u2019t break. \u201cSome guys are doing a charity thing next month. Perogies this time. You in?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerogies?\u201d He let the word sit on his tongue like a prayer bead.\n\n\u201cPerogies,\u201d Brick confirmed. \u201cDifferent skill set, same thrill. Think about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll think,\u201d he said, and he meant it in both the way people say I\u2019ll think when they\u2019re politely bailing and the way some decisions sit in the pocket for weeks before you realize you said yes in your sleep.\n\nWhen he got home, he set the ribbon on the table and then moved it to the top of the fridge because the table needed to be for eating and the ribbon needed to be for something else, undefined. He showered blue away until his skin was mostly his again. He slept as if he had been running. Monday the building would greet him with its ordinary shine and its not-shine, and he would be there with the itch under his skin that the fair had started. He would move. He would mop. He would hum. He would think of Mira\u2019s hands making the littlest circles with pastry and of his father making tea too strong and of we\u2014whoever we were\u2014being okay.\n\nAnd because the world creeps in on soft feet even when you shut the door, a text pinged from a number not in his phone. Nice work out there today, it read. Shame if something, say, unexpected messed up the next big thing. He blinked. The text had no name. The number was a scramble. He considered that this was a joke from Brick or Cannon or some kid who wanted to see what happens when you poke a guy who likes pie. He considered ignoring it. He did. He put the phone face down and listened to the neighbor\u2019s television leak life through the wall. A show where people chased houses, a show where people cooked. He laughed in his chest and then out loud and then quieted. He could feel the fair still on his skin, like glitter you never entirely get rid of.\n\nInez would tell him he was being dramatic when he told her the story later, probably Wednesday because Tuesday had its own personality. Mira would roll her eyes like a kind of yes. His father would say, what did the text actually say, and he would read it to him and hear the silence that means you\u2019ve stepped into a plot someone else thinks is theirs. He told himself people play jokes. He told himself this wasn\u2019t a story. The ribbon on the fridge made a small shadow on the wall like a flag in wind. He fell asleep with the scent of flour in his hair and the taste of sugar at the back of his tongue, and the city outside turned down its volume, and somewhere else in town someone was stirring a pot with more intent than flavour.Chapter 2\n\nMonday always put on its clothes slowly, like it wasn\u2019t entirely sold on the idea. The sky leaned toward ordinary blue, and the truck behind the municipal building was already gone, leaving behind a seam of damp on the asphalt where its shadow had been. The lights clicked awake in sequence and the hum layered up until the building sounded like a polite hive. Owen let himself in and the keys did their whispering work. He liked that sound. It said you belong here in the practical sense even if everything else about belonging is less certain, and it said this is a job you can finish if you keep at it, which is not nothing on a day where you need a sentence like that to prop you up.\n\nThe pink notes on the board were fresh, Inez\u2019s tidy print a balm and a prod. Chair leg scuffs. Someone tracked mulch through the northeast hallway, why. A doodle of a cat, because she couldn\u2019t help herself. He cracked his knuckles like a man about to play the piano and rolled his bucket to the tap. The water went cloudy the way it always did at first and then cleared as if it had remembered itself. He tipped in the measured slosh of soap and the air shifted toward citrus and chemical righteousness. He thought of the text and told himself not to think of the text. He thought of the ribbon on his fridge, a little flag that had no country to fly for. He thought of pie in a way that made his stomach tilt, the way your stomach reminds you it is a creature with a personality.\n\nIt\u2019s a prank, he told himself as he pressed the mop to tile and taught the tile to shine again. It\u2019s a kid with a fake number and time on their hands. It is not a plot. This is a town where plots involve garden beds and the occasional fundraiser. He heard his own voice in his head and knew he sounded like a man trying to be reasonable in front of an unreasonable feeling. He put the feeling under his heel with the dirt and pushed.\n\nBy the time Inez arrived, cardigan buttoned wrong and then corrected, the building felt like a routine you could set your watch by. She had a tote bag with a cartoon goat on it and the words You\u2019ve Goat To Be Kidding Me, which she claimed she had not bought for herself and was a lie no court would uphold.\n\n\u201cYou look like someone hit you with a bag of sleep and missed,\u201d she said, handing him a wrapped muffin the size of a hockey puck.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very specific,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd accurate.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll accept a kindness in the morning and then get philosophical on my lunch break,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s our deal. How was your circus yesterday? I watched a live stream until my internet remembered it lives in a basement apartment under a freeway and a thunderstorm.\u201d\n\n\u201cThird,\u201d he said. \u201cBronze in blueberry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThird? I would have bet you fourth,\u201d she said, and when he cocked an eyebrow she patted his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s my way of making third sound better than expected so you don\u2019t feel the need to punch a locker. Proud of you, hanger. You did the thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, and the thanks had weight. He put the ridiculous muffin in the pocket of his jacket because he would forget it otherwise and find it in November.\n\nHe told her about the text because not telling her felt like holding your breath for no reason. The words came out more dramatic than they had sounded in his head, as if saying a thing always makes it grow a little. Her face didn\u2019t do alarm, not at first. It did the calculation of a person whose life has introduced them to a handful of stupid human behaviors and taught them not to jump at shadows but also not to ignore a shape in the dark with a hat on.\n\n\u201cShow me,\u201d she said, reaching for his phone with the casual authority of a nurse. He handed it over and she read the message twice as if it might rearrange on the second pass. \u201cKids, mostly. Sometimes adults being kids. Could be one of your new\u2026 professional acquaintances. The big one with the name like a construction material. What is it. Brick. He seems kind, though. The blonde one seemed like a handshake you don\u2019t want.\u201d\n\n\u201cCannon,\u201d he said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t\u2026 He was fine. His girlfriend wears foam, but he was fine.\u201d\n\nShe nodded, satisfied with her personal taxonomy of men. \u201cStill. Save the number. If they send another thing, we go to a person with a badge. Not because I think it\u2019s serious, but because I slept less last night than I will ever admit to another soul and it made me unkind in my head. It\u2019s always fine until it isn\u2019t and then you wish you told someone before. And because I like saying to people with badges, here is my evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can call Dad and tell him I\u2019ve collected evidence,\u201d he said, half a joke, half a practice run for later.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll make tea too strong and tell you to get a dog,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a dog. You need new socks and a vacation and for the city to replace that mop head more than once a season. Run along. Go make the glass a hymn.\u201d\n\nHe hummed while he did it, because the building demanded hums like some people demand background music to decide how to feel. Outside the morning arranged itself into its usual parade. Men in neon vests stacked orange cones. Women with lanyards clutched coffee and purpose. A boy on a bike streaked a line between cars like a comet that refused to learn. The text sat in his pocket like a coin he wasn\u2019t using because he didn\u2019t know if it was lucky or a trick.\n\nAt ten he ate the muffin because he had to honor the covenant of a gifted baked good and because if he did not, Inez would quiz him later like a mother hen with a degree in interrogation. It was bran with cranberries that pretended they were cherries when they wanted to impress you. He texted his father a photo of the ribbon against his fridge door and wrote Third. The reply came five minutes later, as if his father had needed to stare at the picture and make a decision about jokes. A man came third in 1956 and is still mentioned in the family storybook, his father wrote. That man caught a fish, but pie is more elusive. Proud of you. Keep receipts. He laughed out loud and scared a squirrel on the window ledge into having a moral crisis.\n\nAfter his shift, he headed toward the Blue Spruce because a habit is a road you like, and also because some days you need to stand in a smell that remembers that life is not just work. The bakery window was fogged around the edges as if the place were thinking hard. A handwritten sign that was not usually there hung cockeyed on the glass: Closed for an hour\u2014plumbing tantrum. He put his hand to the cool pane because he had the childish superstition that you can comfort a building through its windows. It made no sense and felt right.\n\nHe knocked gently with a knuckle as if that were somehow different than knocking with a fist, and Mira appeared from the back like a woman pulling herself through molasses. Her face was a storm you could see the sun behind. She let him in with a gesture and a sigh that had tiny knives in it.\n\n\u201cIf you tell me you\u2019re good with wrenches, I will marry you out of gratitude and then we can get divorced after the pipes behave,\u201d she said, half in jest and half in a low-dosage plea.\n\n\u201cI can mop with the best of them and I can Google with the rest of them,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\n\nShe took him to the back where the world was a chaos of flour ghosts and wet footprints. Someone had shut the water off, then on, then off again. The floor was a small lake with islands of stainless steel table legs and a population of guilty-looking towels. The sink had a look of innocence that sinks practice when they\u2019ve done something without meaning to. He squatted to look under it the way a man does when he has no real plan and found the shutoff valve slick with something that was not water. He touched it with the tip of a finger because the part of his brain that says don\u2019t touch glistening things was on break, and he lifted his finger to his nose. It had a smell he knew: a whisper of WD-40, garage-flavored and smug.\n\n\u201cDid you oil your valve for fun this morning?\u201d he asked, and when she frowned he said, \u201cIt\u2019s slippery. Like someone greased it. Makes it easier to turn, I guess, or harder if you have wet hands and a temper.\u201d\n\nShe looked at him the way people look at a puzzle piece that fits too neatly. \u201cWhy would anyone\u2026 Why.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaintenance? Gremlins? A landlord trying to be helpful? A teenager with a can and a YouTube education?\u201d he said, listing the spectrum because listing is a way to keep panic from building room additions.\n\n\u201cLandlord can\u2019t be bothered to put felt pads on the bottoms of stools,\u201d she said. \u201cTeenager, maybe. Gremlins would have left me a note. This was on when I left last night. I am almost positive. And this morning it was off and in the middle of mixing the fourth batch for a guy who needs three hundred mini tarts like today is the royal wedding, it went on and then it didn\u2019t want to be off and then\u2014\u201d She waved at the floor like she was introducing a guest on a talk show.\n\n\u201cDo you want to call anyone?\u201d he asked. \u201cBesides me, which does your heart credit but might be unwise statistically.\u201d\n\n\u201cI called the plumber, he is in Devon until three and then he will be in a mood,\u201d she said. \u201cI turned off what I could turn off. The main is in the basement that belongs to the pizza place and the pizza guy is in Fort Saskatchewan visiting a mother who cannot be reached. I am living in a sitcom episode with B-plots and a laugh track. Can you\u2014could you\u2014just hold this flashlight while I convince this pipe to choose a personality.\u201d\n\nHe stayed two hours, squeegeeing water toward a drain that did not know the meaning of hurry, ferrying trays to higher ground like pies were refugees, holding a light while she did something that involved plumber\u2019s tape and a prayer she did not say aloud. They found a small note under the back door, folded once, that had blown itself into a puddle and disintegrated into a sullen rectangle. It had been a receipt, probably, for flour or coffee or something with tax on it. It turned into paper stew in his hand and he stood there with pulp and an expression that he would have laughed at if he could see himself.\n\n\u201cYou got a text,\u201d he said, when there was a lull and the floor looked like it might forgive them. He said it in the way you mention weather with a subtext. \u201cLast night. From a number that didn\u2019t sign itself. Said something about the next big thing being a shame if something messed it up. I ignored it because that was the choice that kept me from feeling like a drama queen. Now your sink is a hobby.\u201d\n\nShe straightened and leaned her shoulder against the cool stainless and closed her eyes in a way that wasn\u2019t fatigue but a recalibration. \u201cYou think that has anything to do with this. That\u2019s a leap with good sneakers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I am not at my most rational in the hour after a flood,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think I am doing that thing where coincidences turn into conspiracies because feelings want company.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got one the other day,\u201d she said, and then laughed like the laughter surprised her. \u201cA text. Not exactly like that. More like: Open late this week and see what happens to your nice ranking on the local mom group. Which is weird because I have never asked the local mom group to rank anything. I thought it was an ex-coworker being petty. Or a competitor thinking I was coming for their wedding cake game, which I am not, because brides scare me. People get weird around the concept of fondant.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s two texts,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is not a hundred. But is two.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt could be the same weirdo,\u201d she said. \u201cIt could be two separate weirdos, which would be statistically fascinating and also make me want to lie face-down on the flour sack and wait for a century.\u201d\n\nHe was quiet because the room needed a space that wasn\u2019t words. The drain finally decided it could be a hero, just for a bit, and the lake receded into a respectful puddle. The air took that post-rain smell that feels like a signed apology. He set his squeegee against the wall and wiped his hands on his jeans and looked at the back door again. The lock was the cheap kind you buy in a hardware aisle while grabbing batteries, and the jamb had a scuff at shoulder height where you might bump it if your hands were full. He touched the scuff and it flaked under his finger, one of those paints that never truly bond. He could have made a case for anything and so he did not make a case.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cIdea. You keep your phone on you in your apron like you do. If anyone sends another love letter, we take it to someone whose job is reading love letters that are less loving. Inez will murder me if I let a plot twist happen without telling her. Also, I can bring you a nicer squeegee.\u201d\n\n\u201cA nicer squeegee,\u201d she said with a straight face. \u201cYou know how to woo a lady.\u201d\n\n\u201cI woo with squeegees and sandwiches stolen from the break room,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, I can sit with the door if you want to grab a shower. You smell like determination. It\u2019s a good smell. It is also flour-based.\u201d\n\nShe made a face that held gratitude and mortification in equal measures and went to wash the streaks of the morning off her forearms while he stood in the back with his hands in his pockets and listened. He could hear the bakery front bell chime without customers as if remembering how. The fan over the oven turned its steady circles, sounding like someone deep breathing their way through a mild panic. A kid skateboarded by outside with that clack that makes a whole day sound teenage. He stayed until the plumber arrived and proclaimed all pipes to be mysteries he had learned not to trust and charged a fee that looked like a number you could divide by three pies. When the plumber left, satisfied that nothing would burst while he was twenty minutes away, Mira slid Owen a paper bag with something heavy in it and a look like, let me give this and you don\u2019t argue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m paying you in tarts,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is medieval. It is what I have.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was here because\u2026 I wanted to be,\u201d he said, and heard how that could be read in ten directions. \u201cAnd because your sink attempted a coup. And because I know how to hold a flashlight.\u201d\n\n\u201cEat the tarts,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if you think you never want sugar again, which is adorable. And if you get another thing, you tell me. I will bring my rolling pin and my meanest customer service voice.\u201d\n\nThey stood in the doorway for a minute like a pair of cats who had concluded a treaty. He thought he should tell her she was the kind of person other people send weird texts to because she makes a place people want to be, and some people who cannot make a place get large feelings about those who can. He did not say that because today did not need more words with teeth. They settled for a nod that felt like a plan.\n\nThat evening Darlene called as he was lacing his shoes for no reason except that laces on shoes feel like control. \u201cYou got room in you for a last-minute? Community center\u2019s begging. The mayor\u2019s thing is tomorrow\u2014breakfast with muffins and people wearing polite faces. They want a sweep tonight because some\u2026 youth with a can tasted the thrill of aerosol art. It\u2019s not a mess-mess, but it\u2019s a mess to someone important. I\u2019ll throw it to you with a little hazard bonus if you say yes. If you say no, I will throw it to Joel and then we will all live with Joel\u2019s version of sanitized.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can, yeah,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat time?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn an hour,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd wear your be-seen vest. They want you to be a presence. Ridiculous. As if scrubbing in a vest deters teenagers. Take your keys. Have a good time.\u201d\n\nThe community center had a distinct echo, less jovial than the arena, more municipal. Its halls smelled faintly of chlorine because proximity to the pool makes whole buildings go aquatic in character. He found the spot in the back corridor where someone had sprayed their practice tag, a looping name that could have been BOLT or BOAT or BOZO depending on your faith in curves. The paint was fresh and arrogant. He put on a mask because a man who has spent years breathing ammonia and regret learns to protect what he wants to keep, and he went to work with solvent and rag and patience. The loop softened and bled and then broke, and underneath a ghost version of the letter stuck around like a memory that won\u2019t quite leave a family.\n\nA man in a blue blazer\u2014maybe the same blazer, maybe the blazer had multiplied\u2014appeared at his shoulder and made a noise like a sigh that wanted attention. \u201cVernon,\u201d he said by way of name, as if introducing himself to a microphone. \u201cEvent coordinator. You\u2019re\u2026 the guy with the mop from the other thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cOwen,\u201d he said. He scrubbed and did not give the man the full theater of eye contact because paint does not wait for social niceties. \u201cWhat\u2019s the other thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pie nonsense,\u201d Vernon said, and smiled in a way that said he didn\u2019t entirely mean nonsense but the word had gotten stuck on his tongue. \u201cYou had a\u2026 presence. Thank you for performing for the city. Speaking of performance. We\u2019ve had some mischief. Nothing criminal, I am told, by people who do not understand that this is my reputation we\u2019re discussing. Extension cords go missing like socks in a dryer. A banner unfurls to say WELCO E with no M because someone decided the M could have a private life. Bleach in the mop bucket and then suddenly there is bleach on my hands for the rest of the day, why. Things that make me look like I don\u2019t have hands on things. And then today this, which is just\u2014\u201d He gestured at the wall as if the paint had insulted his mother.\n\n\u201cDid you put a better lock on your storage,\u201d Owen said, not accusing, but asking like a man whose life has taught him you get what you lock.\n\n\u201cHa!\u201d Vernon said. \u201cBudget. This place runs on ten kinds of earnest and two kinds of tape. But yes. We are upgrading. We are generations deep in padlocks. It\u2019ll be fine. If you see anyone with a can or a conspiratorial hat, tell me. You have the look of a man who sees things.\u201d\n\nHe did not say that seeing the things other people don\u2019t want to see is the job description of a janitor. He did not say that his job had trained him to hear the sound of a spill two rooms away and know its viscosity by the way it hit tile. He said he would keep an eye out, and he meant it.\n\nHe finished, left the wall a little cleaner than it had been and also a little bruised, the way surfaces always are after being corrected. On his way out, he ran into Brick in the lobby reading a bulletin board like it was a philosophical text. Brick wore a T-shirt advertising a barbecue that had happened last September and a pair of shorts that could have been a boat in a pinch.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re everywhere a man could be that sells tickets,\u201d Brick said. \u201cYou cleaning this place too? You are going to live to ninety with the lungs of a bassoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody painted a word that wanted to be BOLT,\u201d he said. \u201cVernon is having a day.\u201d\n\n\u201cVernon lives in a permanent day,\u201d Brick said. \u201cHe dates drama like it\u2019s good for his skin. You get any weird messages yet or was that wishful thinking on his part. He told me someone keeps moving his cones so the safety pathway looks like a cat designed it. He thinks it\u2019s personal. I told him sometimes the wind makes choices.\u201d\n\nHe told Brick about the text because he was curious what the man would do with it. Brick scratched at his beard and made a noise that said he was reserving judgment but offering sympathy.\n\n\u201cPeople get odd when they see someone take a bite out of any kind of stage,\u201d Brick said. \u201cNot just pies. I got a lady in Drayton Valley who sends me scripture about gluttony every time I put my name on a sign-up sheet for charity. I tell her I\u2019m raising money for the library and she tells me libraries are dens of iniquity because they lend out romance novels. We live in a time. If someone says, do this or I\u2019ll do a drama, you go to a grown-up and tell them. Cops. Venue. Your dad if he carries a large wrench. Don\u2019t invite the game onto your porch and then complain when the raccoon opens your garbage.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood advice,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you just call me a garbage can.\u201d\n\n\u201cI called all of us a garbage can,\u201d Brick said, with the ease of a man comfortable with metaphor. \u201cWe hold things for the world, they overflow, and then we get a raccoon. Cannon would tell you to film the texts for content and monetize your anxiety. He\u2019s not entirely wrong. Hey, perogies. Think about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking,\u201d Owen said. \u201cBetween now and when I\u2019m eighty.\u201d\n\nHe drove home with the smell of solvent on his hands in a ghost way that all the soap in the world never fully fixes. His father called on schedule and the conversation did its dance, weather, the fact that a cousin\u2019s second child had decided to be a bassoonist, money that behaves like a cat that only likes you when you\u2019re not looking, and then the text because Owen owed him the truth and himself the relief of saying it out loud to a voice that had steadied him since he stood on a chair to reach the tap.\n\n\u201cIt said what, exactly,\u201d his father said, and Owen read it to him in the bald form of things. \u201cI would be tempted to call Constable Lowe and say, here is a thing, and brush your teeth, and then go on with your day. He will tell you it is probably a teenager. He will write it down in a notebook that smells like institutional coffee and he will tell you to keep him posted. It is not nothing and it is not an emergency unless it becomes one, and then you will wish you had a notebook entry somewhere with your name and the word told. Bring Mira a better lock for that back door. I will pay you back if you need me to feel involved.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need you to feel involved,\u201d he said, and smiled to hear his own teenage voice in there somewhere. \u201cBut I accept the lock as a family project.\u201d\n\n\u201cDone,\u201d his father said. \u201cDon\u2019t go inventing enemies because your life tried on a stage for a weekend. But don\u2019t let someone else decide to make you part of theirs. Be careful. Eat a vegetable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ate a bran muffin.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t count,\u201d his father said. \u201cBut it tries. Good night.\u201d\n\nHe slept like a person in a train that doesn\u2019t stop in his town, half aware of motion and the occasional station name called out in a voice he couldn\u2019t parse. He woke to Tuesday trying to be a joke about Mondays and failing. The mayor\u2019s breakfast had a tablecloth piety to it, and the building wanted to stand a little straighter. He did the extra pass over the corridor where dignitaries would glide, and he collected his bucket with the feeling that you get when you look under the couch and find both a penny and a receipt for something you had meant to return.\n\nOn the way past the front desk, he saw a new note in someone\u2019s hurried hand: Remember: media at ten. Be kind. Be brief. There was a drawing of a microphone with rays around it the way kids draw the sun, as if sound were a warm thing. He straightened the stack of pamphlets and made the chairs stand like a platoon. He did not know why he felt protective, but he did.\n\nThe first text of the day came at nine-twenty, when the room was a soft uproar of muffins and introductions. Nice work on the scrub job, it said. You\u2019re good at making things look like nothing happened. Do you want to keep being good at that, or do you want to see what happens when no one cleans up messes. He swallowed because it seemed the appropriate response and because his throat had gone dry. He took a screenshot with a hand that tried to be steady. He looked around at faces and saw none turned toward him with wickedness painted on. The thing about fear is it convinces you everyone is an actor in your play.\n\nHe walked the long way to the back office where Inez was pretending to answer phones that had not rung yet. She listened to the new message with her head tilted like a bird. She did not swear, because she had a vow about that, but she said, \u201cOh, for the love of thread,\u201d which was her version. She marched him to Darlene, who put on her boss face and then her human face and then picked up the phone with a sigh like a woman making bread. \u201cConstable Lowe,\u201d she said when someone on the other end answered. \u201cDo you have a minute for nothing-too-drastic but not-nothing.\u201d\n\nThey sat in a small room that smelled of toner and listened to a man with kind eyes and end-of-shift energy say the things his father had predicted. He wrote in a notebook that had coffee scars on the cardboard, and he nodded in the rhythm of a man who knows when nodding is part of the medicine. \u201cKeep the messages,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t write back. Tell us if it escalates. Are you going to any events where a mess would truly be exciting. What\u2019s your access to buildings not your own.\u201d Owen told him about keys and about the community center call. Lowe\u2019s eyes did a flicker that meant he\u2019d add a note that said janitor with keys, which in some small percentage of cases turns into a plot point and in most cases turns into a line in a file that gets dusty.\n\n\u201cDo you think this is about the Saturday event, the pancake thing,\u201d Darlene asked, because even people who say they\u2019re not nervous ask about specific mornings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a run of silly,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cSomeone threw a stink bomb under the bleachers at a high school ball game and a kid tripped over an extension cord that wasn\u2019t where it had been a minute before. Someone switched signs outside the petting zoo so the goats ended up in the chickens and the adults found it more upsetting than the animals. We are not exactly in the throes of criminal masterminds. But it\u2019s summer. Mischief wakes up when the lilacs do. If anyone tells you to do a thing or else, come see me before you do it. If they do a thing, call 911 instead of me. People don\u2019t realize they\u2019re allowed to call 911 for things that are not blood, but you are. And\u2014use your eyes. You have eyes.\u201d\n\nHe left the small room with a photocopied page that said How To Report and a feeling like he had done something adult even if that something involved telling someone about texts like a teenager reporting a prank. He sent Mira a message that said, Told a cop. She sent back a gif of a cartoon rolling pin flexing a cartoon bicep.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s breakfast came and went. A man with a voice like a radio station no one listens to spoke for seven minutes about community spirit and fiscal prudence. The muffins were better than the muffins usually are when they are procured by the city. Someone dropped a blueberry on a shoe and someone else tried to be helpful and ground it in with their heel in an act of kindness that left a galaxy where a solar system had been. Owen cleaned it without making it a production and the woman with the blueberry toe said thank you in a way that had a little relief in it, and he filed the thank you away with the ribbon on top of the fridge in the cabinet labeled This Is Why.\n\nAfter lunch he walked to the hardware store and bought a lock that would not stop a determined thief but would slow down an ambitious raccoon. He liked that the packaging promised more than it could deliver with the sincerity of a newscaster. He brought it to Mira and installed it with his gentle tools while she watched and critiqued his screwdriving technique the way a woman watching you knead bread criticizes the way your wrists forget they\u2019re attached to a living thing. She paid him in a loaf of something with seeds like stars. \u201cYou can decline if it offends you,\u201d she said, and he shrugged and put the loaf under his arm like a newspaper.\n\nIn the late afternoon the second text of the day arrived while he was on his couch doing the thing where you sit but do not rest. It said, The next big thing is not muffins. The next big thing is Sunday\u2019s fireworks. Shame, right, if all those families with blankets saw smoke where they didn\u2019t want it. He stared for a count of seven because he had decided seven is how long you pause when deciding whether to panic. He forwarded it to Lowe and to Darlene and to himself, because he wanted a copy that didn\u2019t exist only in the air. He did not write back. He did not call his father immediately because his father would tell him to call someone else first. He called Vernon, because if there was a man in town who wore a blazer to bed in case of event emergencies, it was Vernon.\n\n\u201cFireworks,\u201d he said, and Vernon made a noise like a peacock discovering a snake.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Vernon said. \u201cOh, no. I have had a day. Now I have a week. Thank you. Do not worry. I live to worry for you. That is my function.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe\u2026 lock something,\u201d he said, which was useless advice and both of them knew it.\n\n\u201cFireworks are already in a truck in a place that is not a place because we do not say where the fireworks live,\u201d Vernon said, with unhelpful theatricality. \u201cWe will be on them. Your job is to continue making things invisible. Mine is to shake like a Chihuahua while still appearing smooth. If you see a man with a match, grab him. Metaphorically. Probably. I will call Lowe. I have his number more memorized than my own.\u201d\n\nHe set down the phone and looked at his room like it might answer a question. The ribbon on the fridge caught a slant of light and turned it into a beam that cut across the table where he ate and wrote and sometimes fell asleep on his arms. He walked over and stood very still and then took it down and moved it to the side of the fridge, where it would not be in the sun. He told himself it was because the red would fade. He told himself it was not because he did not want something bright to be a target in a room that suddenly felt like something could throw.\n\nBecause distraction is both enemy and friend, he went for a run. It was more of a shuffle, a cow in a hurry, but it put breath in his lungs in a way that made room in his head. He ran past the pond because he always did, and the ducks argued in their parliament of weeds. A couple sat on a bench with their shoulders touching as if they could give each other posture. He thought of the fireworks and the blanket families and the smell of sulphur that somehow makes memory more sticky. He thought of a person with intent to stir a pot and how that person might have a story that made them think they were the hero. He thought of the way small towns can cradle and suffocate in the same gesture.\n\nAt the end of the loop, he saw a kid hunched over the base of a lamppost with a can in their hand. He slowed because if life is going to deliver you clich\u00e9s you can at least walk up to them with your eyes open. The kid was Brayden, the teenager with the underlined Y, his hair flopped over one eye in an arrangement that did not happen by accident. He started when he saw Owen and then tried to look casual with a technique that would not have fooled a blind librarian.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Owen said. \u201cArt?\u201d\n\n\u201cSticker,\u201d Brayden said, and held up a small circle that said SG YOUTH in a font that wanted to be rebellious when it grew up. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to put them on the skatepark bulletin board. The lamppost was me deciding the lamppost deserved a sticker. I am removing it because a woman with a small dog that looks like a croissant told me to get a job.\u201d\n\n\u201cJobs are overrated when you already have to be a student,\u201d he said. \u201cHey. Weird question. You know anyone who thinks texts are a sport.\u201d\n\nBrayden looked like someone had asked him to parse poetry. \u201cTexts are a sport,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe kind where you send them to strangers and try to make their Tuesday interesting,\u201d Owen said gently.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Brayden said, and genuinely thought about it. \u201cLike that thing where you send your friends a picture of a lawn chair and say, this is your future. My cousin did that until his mom took his phone and then he went outside and it was wild. I don\u2019t know. People are weird. If anybody\u2019s doing that I will flame them on our group chat. Is it about the fireworks. There\u2019s a rumor the fireworks got stolen last year but then they weren\u2019t stolen they were just late because a guy took the wrong exit in Nisku and had a panic attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d he said, which was honest in a way that left space to breathe. \u201cIf anyone brags about pranks more than they should, send them that choosing-to-be-kind meme with the raccoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like that raccoon,\u201d Brayden said, and peeled the sticker with the delicacy of a surgeon. \u201cAdults are so scary about fireworks. It\u2019s like the sky will get mad if we don\u2019t do it right.\u201d\n\nHe went home with the odd feeling that teenagers sometimes hold more of a town\u2019s future than the people who imagine they do. He toasted a slice of seed bread and burned it because he forgot he was making toast and this is a good time to remember that humans are distractible and therefore endearing. He scraped the char into the sink and watched it settle like the end of a snow globe. He answered a text from Inez that said, Update me or I will assume you\u2019re dead, and he told her about Lowe and Vernon and the fireworks and Brayden and the raccoon. She replied with eight goat emojis she had gone out of her way to find.\n\nClose to midnight, his phone lit the dark like a tiny lighthouse. The message said, Good. Tell your new friends with notebooks to keep watch. It would still be a shame if something slipped under the fence. He lay on his back and stared at the ceiling where the lights of cars outside occasionally made a river. He could feel the shape of his keys in his pocket even though they hung on their hook, and he could feel the city\u2019s breath in his bones. He did not answer. He did not sleep easily. It was a waiting kind of night.\n\nBy Wednesday morning the town had gotten wind because towns are lungs and news is oxygen. In the coffee line a man in a camo hat opined about kids these days and a woman in leggings said it was probably adults because kids don\u2019t coordinate that well and the barista said fireworks are dumb unless you\u2019re five or a dog, and Mira when he stopped by told him the plumber had found an excuse to swing by again because the valve needed a talking-to, which is plumber for a bill. She wore her hair in a braid that meant business. There was a small pile of locks on the counter like a display at a hardware-themed bridal shower.\n\n\u201cYou get any sleep,\u201d she asked, and he told her he had gotten the variety where you dream you\u2019re late for a test in a subject no one has heard of. \u201cMe too,\u201d she said. \u201cI dreamed my oven had hands and threw my tray of croissants on the floor and then apologized in French.\u201d\n\n\u201cI talked to a teenager and he was almost reassuring,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich I did not expect. Lowe says tell him if anyone asks you to do anything. No one has asked me. They like to imply. Maybe they think this is noir and they\u2019re mysterious. Meanwhile I\u2019m over here with a bucket trying to prevent municipal calamity.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrevent calamity,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is a noble mission statement. We should put it on a T-shirt. Also, if you do end up in a noir, please don\u2019t wear a fedora. Not everyone looks good in a brim.\u201d\n\nHe left with a cinnamon scone he did not intend to eat and ate half of it before he reached the crosswalk because trying not to eat a cinnamon scone is like trying not to look at a sunset. At the building, the day unrolled. Keys turned. Doors sighed. A woman in a blazer he had never seen carried a binder like a person holding a newborn. The council chamber smelled of wood warmed by air. He cleaned a spill that had no origin story and buffed out a scratch on a plexi sign that told people to be kind as if signs could change tempers. He waited for a text and one did not come, which was worse in the way the body hates a lull when it has learned to expect a sound.\n\nAt four, Lowe called and said he\u2019d like to swing by his place, if that was okay, because sometimes seeing where a person exists helps you understand their map. Owen said yes because saying no felt like the stubbornness of a man who thinks he is not connected to the place he sleeps. Lowe arrived with a smile and a notebook and an ability to stand in a room without making it smaller. He looked at the ribbon on the fridge with the interest of a human who enjoys being in a town where a ribbon on a fridge means something. He asked what Owen did between nine and midnight on any given day and Owen made a joke about toast and told the truth and felt a heat in his face that was not shame but the thing that comes when someone writes down your life in bullet points.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not in trouble,\u201d Lowe said, as if detecting the temperature. \u201cYou\u2019re just in the middle of a thing that might be a thing and might be a nervous person trying out power. There\u2019s a crew covering the fireworks area tonight and the night after. Gates with locks and a guy named Sven who lifts more than is strictly required by society. You don\u2019t have to go be a hero. If you see something odd, call. If your friend with the rolling pin gets a message, tell her to not reply. If someone tries to hand you a bag to leave under a table, throw it in the river. That last one is partly humor. Don\u2019t throw bags in rivers. But don\u2019t carry anything that isn\u2019t yours.\u201d\n\nAfter he left, Owen stood in the kitchen and watched the way light falls on a late summer evening when the sun is tired but proud. He cut the seed bread and buttered it with the reverence you give to something that happened because hands worked. His phone was quiet. The neighbor\u2019s television offered a medical drama where a surgeon made a joke right before saving a life. He dictated a text to his father he didn\u2019t send about how doing nothing feels like a task. He wiped the counter with a rag until it gleamed. He was aware of his own framework, of bones that have had decades to learn how to carry a man in and out of small boats of life. He did not think of pie.\n\nThursday morning the sky was the color of refrigerator light and the wind wore a jacket. He stopped by the fireworks field because he had to see or he would invent. It was cordoned with well-intentioned fences and a sign that said Authorized Personnel Only in type that thought bold meant stern. Two men unloaded boxes that did not reveal their secrets. Lowe stood with a thermos and a posture that said, you can come no closer, and waved at Owen with an economy that made it friendly and not chatty. He waved back and kept moving because he did not need to be another body in a place where bodies were being counted.\n\nHe made it to the office five minutes before his shift because he had read somewhere that being early is good for your teeth. Inez patted his arm with that perfect pressure that says I\u2019m here and then made a goat noise because she could. They moved through the day together the way a good team moves through a kitchen, wordlessly dancing around stools and avoiding each other\u2019s momentum. At noon he got a text that was not the kind they had been receiving but a photo of a raccoon with a piece of bread. Brayden had sent it with the caption, Choose to be kind. He smiled and let it soften something that had started to calcify.\n\nThe weird thing about days with suspense in them is they still want you to buy milk. He went to the grocery store after work and stared at apples in pyramids and had the thought anyone in a panic has at produce, which is how can the world be this specific and banal at once. He bought spinach because it looked like it could fix a soul. He bought a magazine with a crossword because crosswords trick your brain into thinking you\u2019re on a mission. He told the cashier his number and they pretended it gave him points that would one day buy him a toaster.\n\nFriday, the text was silent. Saturday morning, the town set up chairs and blankets with the choreography of tradition. Brick sent him a message that said, Perogy contest volunteers meeting at nine, bring your stomach and your moral compass, and a photo of a pierogi with a face drawn on it that was both adorable and wrong. Mira snapped a picture of a pie with a perfect lattice and no context and sent it with a caption that said, Remind me why I do this to myself, and then followed it with, Because someone eats it and smiles. He walked through the fair like a man walking through a set he had helped build. He bought a lemonade from a child whose seriousness about her cash box made him want to nominate her for mayor. He declined a cinnamon donut because life is choices, even if half of them you only pretend to make.\n\nAt dusk, the field breathed like a sleeping animal. People spread out under the sky. Laughter did that thing where it beads and rolls. In the distance a train said its own name. Owen found a spot near the edge where you can get out if you need to because a man who thinks about egress more now than he did at twenty is a man who has worked in rooms with only one exit and learned to plan. He texted his father, I am sitting on a blanket like a sensible person, and got back a picture of the kettle with the note, Me too.\n\nAs the first flares cracked upward with that tiny cough that precedes the blast, his phone buzzed and his stomach drew itself into a fist because the body does not care if you are trying to enjoy lights. He looked. The message said, It\u2019s pretty when things go as planned. He waited seven seconds and then ten. He watched the shower of white and remembered being small and thinking they must be catching stars and releasing them. He waited, and nothing else came. He felt foolish for how he had braced and then unmanned by how relieved he was. He watched the show with an eye on the fence even as his heart surrendered a little to the theater.\n\nAfter, on the slow flow out of the field, he ran into Lowe, who had a smudge on his cheek that could have been smoke or chocolate. \u201cAll right,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cSometimes that\u2019s what we get. All right.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Owen said, and they stood in the river of people for a beat as if refusing to be carried until they chose to be.\n\nOn the way to his car, he saw Vernon standing alone under a lamppost, blazer slung over his shoulder like a man who would not admit he sweated. He looked up and gave Owen a thumbs up that was more graceful than most thumbs. \u201cWe did not have drama,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had only light. I will sleep for three hours and then I will think of a new thing to fret. Come to the pancake feed tomorrow. Bring your appetite and a small sense of gratitude we can all borrow when ours runs out.\u201d\n\nSunday morning the pancakes were sponges for the syrup of grace. He flipped a few at a volunteer station because someone handed him a spatula and he could not say no to a man with a beard net and a smile that scratched the air. He spilled batter on the griddle and learned on the second try that patience is in fact a tool. He met a woman who had taught him in fourth grade how to multiply by nines with your fingers and he thanked her because it seemed time. He laughed with Brick and did not mention perogies because that felt like tempting the gods, if small towns had gods, which they do, and they\u2019re sometimes goats.\n\nWhen he got home, he found an envelope tucked in the crack between his door and the jam, a trick everyone who has ever left a flyer has learned because mail slots are for landlords. It had no stamp and his name in a hand that was trying very hard to be ordinary. Inside was a photograph printed at a place that still does such a thing. It was the hallway outside the mayor\u2019s office, and in the corner was a mop bucket under a sign that said Wet Floor in a silhouette of a man who had fallen in a sticky triangle. His chest did a small trick. Nothing bad in the picture, just a picture of a place he knew in a time he had been there. On the back, printed with a very fine pen, two words: Nice shine.\n\nHe sat on the edge of his bed with the photograph in his hands and thought, this is a person who wants me to know they can watch. It was petty and theatrical and maybe the kind of thing a person does when they want you to be a character in a story you didn\u2019t ask to be in. He took a photo of the photo and texted it to Lowe with the caption, New fan mail. Then he texted Inez a picture of his own face making a face and she sent back a picture of her knitting a sweater for a goat with the caption, Everyone needs a hobby. He texted Mira a close-up of the word shine and she wrote, Obsessive. Underline. And then, I am making cinnamon rolls tomorrow like a person who believes in mornings.\n\nHe set the photograph on the table and put a coaster on top of it as if the weight mattered to anything and then he laughed at himself because coasters have never stopped a flood or a man. He took a breath. He looked at his keys hanging on their hook. He thought of doors being his profession and his life. He told himself the truth that living is ninety percent squeegeeing small puddles and ten percent dealing with a wave. He got up and did the dishes because your hands get busy when your head can\u2019t decide. He hummed a new tune that might have been an old hymn and thought, okay. If this is a story, I\u2019ll do it the way I do floors. One square at a time. And if it isn\u2019t, I\u2019ll still keep my rags clean.Chapter 5\n\nHeat came in with the confidence of a friend who never knocks. The mornings stopped pretending to be cool even when they were blue, and the afternoon wind smelled like someone had left a bread oven door open somewhere on the prairie. The building took it in and let it out the way old buildings do, sighing around expansions and contractions, settling into the season with a creak. Owen\u2019s mop water looked like melted coins in the bucket before the soap turned it into a lake where citrus clouds drifted. He dragged the mop in straight, stubborn lines and thought about how light sits differently on a floor in July. It\u2019s less forgiving, more direct. It tells the truth about places you missed.\n\nBy nine the first text arrived like a mosquito no one had invited. Leave the south door to the annex on the latch tonight, it said. No one will know. You\u2019ll sleep, town sleeps, everyone wins. He read it twice and the skin between his shoulder blades tightened the way it does when a breeze comes from a door you didn\u2019t know was open. The annex door was the one Inez calls The Door of Destiny because it sticks in winter and flirts in summer, a door that could make a sermon out of any day. He put the phone in his pocket and it burned there like a small stove.\n\nHe could have kept it to himself for an hour, maybe two, to see if his brain would build a case for pretending, but he had promised too many people not to be ridiculous. He walked it straight to Darlene, who was eating a yogurt with the resignation of a woman who had wanted a donut and the discipline of a woman who knew what donuts do at two in the afternoon. She didn\u2019t say are you sure even though some bosses would have in a voice that puts the burden back in your hands. She said, \u201cWe call Lowe,\u201d and sniffed the yogurt like it might apologize.\n\nIn Lowe\u2019s small office the fan clicked as it rotated, the kind of click you stop noticing if your nerves are not tuned for it. Lowe listened and the corners of his eyes did their little squint that could be humor or could be the way a man reads a map he\u2019s seen before. \u201cWe set the table, then,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t put the dish where they ask us to put it. We set the table where the dish belongs, and we leave out something unappetizing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean,\u201d Darlene asked, practical down to the fibres of her blazer. \u201cBecause I am not setting my table with a stink bomb.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means I put my person where they expect you not to,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means if the request is about the south door, we make the south door sing like a choir when it opens and we leave the west door alone like a sleeping cat, and anyone who knows their way around will go where they think we\u2019re dumb enough to give. It also means I would like your permission to tuck a camera in your fern. No, not the sad one. The one with ambition.\u201d\n\nDarlene\u2019s mouth went sideways. She loved her ferns the way some people love particular pens. \u201cThe fern will testify if it must,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if anyone waters it while you\u2019re in there, tell them to stop. It was emotionally overwatered as a child.\u201d She turned to Owen, and whatever bossness she kept around for days when people argued about time sheets drained out and left something older. \u201cYou don\u2019t touch that door. Not by accident. If you were the type to be tempted, which you aren\u2019t, this would be the day to consider how long it takes to rebuild trust. It is not a mop head. It is slow.\u201d\n\nHe thought of keys, of the way they whisper when they thread through their ring, of the weight of them against his hip when he walks. He thought of being trusted with entries and exits and how it had quietly become an identity in a way that had nothing to do with exceptionalism and everything to do with showing up. \u201cI hear you,\u201d he said. He heard himself, too, and the part of him that wants to compromise to make a nuisance go away sat in a chair and did not get a say.\n\nAt lunch he took his sandwich to the back steps and watched a grasshopper lose a fight with a gust of wind and then win the second round like an athlete who\u2019d read all the wrong stats. He called his father because you don\u2019t always wait until Sunday for the normal voice. His father let him tell it and did not interrupt except to ask which door, because specifics calm him. \u201cDo you know why that door,\u201d he asked, and Owen said he didn\u2019t and that he could make ten arguments for it being any door because people like to pretend they\u2019re thinking of a door when what they want is to see if you\u2019ll do what you\u2019re told.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s someone testing the edges of you,\u201d his father said. \u201cPeople do that when they can\u2019t manage their own. Don\u2019t be angry in a way that makes you sloppy. I am proud and somewhat worried in equal measures, which I suspect is my permanent condition until they put me in the ground and I start worrying about the worms.\u201d He chuckled and made tea too strong and said, \u201cLock your locking, son,\u201d and Owen found the laugh loosening something.\n\nThe bakery was a soft ferocity when he stopped by. The lights looked as if they had read a poem and wanted to be kinder. Mira had a smear of cocoa across one cheek that made her look like she\u2019d survived a battle and won. On the counter lay an array of small locks in packaging, a nest of keys like a school of fish, and a lemon tart that had not yet been asked to be perfect.\n\n\u201cYou look like a man who is thinking about hinges,\u201d she said, sliding a plate toward him because she has learned that if you hand him food his mouth will eventually say the thing he came to say. He told her about the text, about Lowe\u2019s plan, about the fern with eyes, and she made the face she makes when she has both an opinion and the wisdom to deliver it gently. \u201cNobody asks you to make your own life smaller unless they already made theirs too small to live in,\u201d she said. \u201cYou do not become less just because someone says please. See how I did not swear. Are we proud of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, and meant it. \u201cDo you know what I thought of when I read it. My eight-year-old self standing on a chair and my dad saying don\u2019t touch the stove, and me touching the stove because touching is the way to learn. This is not a stove I need to touch in order to know it\u2019s hot.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at you growing your prefrontal cortex,\u201d she said, and took the cocoa streak off her face with the back of her hand just to smear it on the other side. \u201cI got another thing this morning. From a different number, I think. It said, never mind about staying open late, what if you just stop making those ugly braided loaves. And they spelled braided like a person who had been betrayed by braids. I had to sit on my hands so I didn\u2019t write back and tell them my loaves are prettier than their soul. I blocked it and then I iced a batch of cupcakes so exacting I scared myself.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t like that the messages had multiplied like rabbits on spring grass. He didn\u2019t like that their edges fuzzed out into the whole town the way gossip is a fog and not a line. He told her he\u2019d be in touch after the door plan, and she told him she would be at home with a rolling pin and a movie and a willingness to throw her phone in the freezer if need be. He wished he could guarantee her a quiet night the way you wish you could guarantee someone will love you back. You can promise your actions. The rest remains a community project.\n\nThey rigged the annex like a house at Halloween, except less fun and with more paperwork. Lowe\u2019s person turned out to be a woman in a jacket that did not mind the heat, hair tucked up neat, manner like a Sunday school teacher with a black belt. She gave the kicked fern a rueful pat and tucked her camera low and sat among filing cabinets as if she\u2019d been there forever. Owen made his passes like a man walking pixie dust into a plan, checking that the jalousie window on the west side caught fine dust when he snapped it, wiping down the glass with a blue rag that left nothing but the scent he associated with working and sleep. He felt watched and did not like that he liked it less when the watching was on his side. He told himself it was good. He told himself once and it was enough.\n\nThe night edged in with its summer soundtrack of skittering bicycles and someone two blocks over trying the guitar with more enthusiasm than technique. He finished his shift a shade later than he wanted and allowed himself the laziness of leaving a chair not exactly where he had found it because he planned to put it there in the morning anyway. He stood at the south annex door long enough to feel like a clich\u00e9, then walked away. He locked the west door and double-checked it, so he would not build a movie in his head about what he had done wrong. He said goodnight to the building just loud enough to make himself smile.\n\nIf the person who sent the text had been a character in a book he would have arrived with a cat under his arm and a hat too serious for his head. Instead, he came in on sneaker soles, quiet not because he was practiced but because night makes us all lighter. Lowe\u2019s person watched him on a screen the size of a paperback and wrote something down she would copy into a report later. He passed by the south door and put his hand on it in that way people touch surfaces to make sure the laws of physics still apply. He tried the handle and frowned when it didn\u2019t give. He moved toward the west door with a little huff in his chest that was either indignation or exertion. He had a bag that did not sag enough to hold anything dramatic. He had a posture that said apology rehearsed and readiness scratched. He went for the west door as if he had not been told what to do about a door but knew a lot about what the building does anyway.\n\nThey let him open it and then stepped into the space the way people who train to do this move without drama, just correctness. \u201cEvening,\u201d Lowe\u2019s person said, as if she were interrupting a man checking church pews for left-behind Bibles. \u201cYou have a key for that.\u201d\n\nThe man\u2019s face did an alphabet. Surprise, indignation, reasoning, charm. He went with charm and then abandoned it three words in for irritation because charm is a suit you have to fit for, and it had not been tailored for him. \u201cI work here,\u201d he said, which is a sentence as unhelpful as I belong here. \u201cI had to grab something I left.\u201d\n\nShe asked to see his badge and the way he reached for his belt told her everything. He did not wear a badge. He wore a clip where a badge might be if he were the sort of man to clip one there. His hand hovered as if he could conjure a rectangle with a photo on it through wishes and the friction of his fingers. She asked his name then, and when he said Joel, something that had been resting in Owen\u2019s head like a small bird with a broken foot lifted and turned over.\n\nJoel. The coworker with the tendency to treat all jobs as equal because all jobs needed a body moving in them and he had a body. Joel of the sloppy edges, the ghost shifts, the airing of grievances so passively you needed a translator. Joel who sometimes left a mop head sitting in the bucket as if mop heads like being baptized for hours. Joel whom Darlene sent when she had no one else to send and apologized to the building under her breath because she\u2019d be the one to fix the corners later. Joel with a jaw that clenched when Darlene picked someone else for the church contract and who had once suggested in a voice he thought was quiet that if the council changed over next fall, contracts might change, too.\n\nThey walked him into the light like a man being introduced to the stage for the first time and sat him at a table as if this were an interview. Lowe appeared out of the corridor with that gentle faux-surprise he uses on people who need to be told what is already obvious. He offered Joel water and asked whether he likes events, whether he likes fireworks, whether he likes attention. Joel answered like a man walking down a hall where doors keep opening and behind each door is a person who wants him to say yes. He said he was trying to prove a point. He said if people saw how thin the staffing is they would stop calling Darlene at home at eleven about a paper towel dispenser that wouldn\u2019t behave and start feeling grateful. He said he had been embarrassed for months by the low-grade messes he couldn\u2019t clean when he wasn\u2019t on the schedule, that pride is weird in a janitor, that nobody sees you until you fail.\n\nIt was a story that could sit in a room without being pitched, and it could also be a way to not say something else. He had a can of stink in the bag, old-school and destructive to nostrils, but not the kind of thing that would make the six o\u2019clock news. He had a towel in there that didn\u2019t belong to any building they knew. He had a key that had once opened a closet in the community center before Darlene re-cored it, which is its own story if you know how buildings hold on to their teeth. His phone had numbers in it that Lowe would not scroll in front of them, because there are laws and also because decency is not a law and still matters.\n\nOwen was allowed to be part of the room the way the person who finds the first footprint on a flour-dusted floor gets to stand a little closer to the crime. He watched Joel fold into himself, not dramatically, not like a man being booked in a movie, but like a person who had come at night with a plan to feel bigger and instead realized he was small in the precise way we all are when the lights are this bright. He felt anger fizz and settle. This wasn\u2019t sexy. This was a man with a bag and a small story who had sent texts like a boy playing spy. This was also a man who knew his way around wet floor signs and valves and the habit of hiding digital footsteps. You can fit more than one truth in a room, especially when it smells like lemon polish and rethinking.\n\nThe parts that followed were dull in the way justice should be dull. Statements written in narrow boxes. A call to a boss. A decision not to put handcuffs on a man who had mostly threatened theater. The bag labeled. The fern turned back toward the window, because even in municipal dramas we do not leave plants facing walls. Lowe\u2019s promise that unspectacular charges are still charges and that people change their behavior for two reasons: they get held, or they find a story they like better. Joel looked like neither option had been available to him for a long time and like maybe, with this not-ordeal in progress, a door had cracked that wasn\u2019t the annex.\n\nAfter, when the building was a body exhaling and Inez relocated her concern into action by reorganizing the drawer where the batteries live, Owen found himself sitting on the back steps again, heat still popping off the asphalt like a body trying to shake water out of its ears. He expected relief like you expect a glass of water to be cold and was surprised when his throat wanted something warmer. He phoned his father and told him the version that didn\u2019t include all the private names, and his father said the sentence he says when a human makes a human mess. \u201cI don\u2019t excuse his bit,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I recognize the recipe. Maybe we can get him a different cookbook.\u201d\n\nBrick texted the way a man texts when he suspects he is not the kind of friend who gets called first but wants to be the kind who shows up second. Did you get your raccoon, he wrote, and then, Sorry, that\u2019s my metaphor when people try to get in your bins. He followed it with, Perogy practice Wednesday; someone\u2019s baba is going to yell at me about my technique and I will cry. Bring your tastebuds and a towel. Owen wrote back that he\u2019d come, because practice in any form was comfort, and because babas yelling love you in a sharp language under the edges.\n\nMira was leaning in her doorway when he came by with no intention except to stand in a place that knows how to smell like welcome. She listened to the story, and her eyes did that soft crinkle at the corners that makes you understand why people tell her things that cost them. \u201cI despise that,\u201d she said. \u201cI despise someone making you think you\u2019re a piece in their game. And at the same time, I could cry for him, messy mop and all.\u201d She shook her head like a dog getting rid of water it did not ask for. \u201cWe have a rule in here. When we fight with our dough\u2014because we all fight with our dough\u2014we have to say nice things to it for a full minute before we throw up our hands and give up. It works on people, too, sometimes. Not always. You can\u2019t make bread rise with compliments alone. But it\u2019s a start.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat nice thing do we say to a man who tries to convince you to leave a door unlocked,\u201d he asked, feeling the joke roll through his chest like a ball he could carry without tripping.\n\n\u201cWe say, you are more interesting than the worst thing you did this summer,\u201d she said, and then made a face. \u201cAnd then we say, pay your fine and get a different job if you can, because you\u2019re not allowed back in my back room with that attitude.\u201d\n\nThey ate a slice of the lemon tart with the concentration of scientists. He told her about how the camera was hidden in the fern, and she laughed until she hiccuped. She told him about the kid who\u2019d come in with his grandma to buy one cupcake and stood on his toes to see and told her, whisper-serious, that the strawberry looked the most like a planet. He thought about how maybe if more people were asked to choose planets from cupcakes, fewer stink devices would ever get purchased from a sketchy online store with free shipping.\n\nYou would think a town exhales and goes back to ring toss and therapy after a week like that, but life does not stack itself neatly. Vernon found a way to have an emergency about table rentals and a person in the mayor\u2019s orbit called twice asking whether the fern was traumatized and whether there was a way to put security on the rest of the plants because you know how these things go, one fern gets the bug and the next thing you know a ficus runs away. The local online mom group produced three lengthy posts about whether leaving a door unlocked counted as endangering children and two about whether fireworks at all are insensitive to dogs, which, Owen had to admit, they might be. Lowe came by to thank him with a box of timbits like a man who knows how to speak Canadian, and Inez knitted a little thing that turned out to be a koozie for the spray bottle they share, which she announced with pride as if she had invented mittens.\n\nThe perogy practice at the community hall was a clatter of bowls and vowels. A line of women and two men who had been drafted rolled and pinched with the assertive tenderness of people who know food is language. Brick arrived with flour on his shirt as if he had got into a fight with a bag and apologized to it. He made a mess of his first dozen and apologized to a grandmother named Svitlana who swatted his knuckles with a spoon and then kissed his cheek hard enough to knock gratitude into his skull. Owen found he was passable at the pinch if he imagined it was a tiny wet floor sign he had to fold, a caution into a comfort. They ate their ugly ones with fried onions and sour cream and a communal silence that attends the right foods.\n\nCannon showed up late with a new T-shirt advertising Chomp Squad, LLC, and a grin that made children like him despite themselves. He clapped Brick on the back, gave Owen a nod that had nothing smarmy in it for once, and told a vivid story about a festival in Red Deer where a man tried to sneak a second stomach under his shirt and almost got away with it. Someone told him the perogy event was charity and not a competition, and he said every potluck is a competition to the right auntie. He was not wrong. Owen left with a container of dumplings that steamed his windshield and a sense that eyes on him were friend-eyes again, not phone numbers hiding behind a curtain.\n\nAt work, the day after Lowe spoke to Joel\u2019s union rep and a letter had been composed and a bench had become useful for a while, the pink notes on the board returned to their ordinary job. Inez drew a goat in sunglasses. Someone wrote a reminder to make two extra pots of coffee on Thursday for the building inspectors who become miserable when caffeine is a theory. The annex door got a new plate on its latch that made it make a different sound when it closed, a more confident clack. The fern looked toward the window like nothing had ever happened, a professionalism Owen envied a little. He swept and mopped and buffed, and he hummed, because if he stopped that, then the texts had taken something they were not allowed to take.\n\nOccasionally the memory of the photo in his door\u2014Nice shine\u2014would surface like a fish in a pond, breaking his surface with a ripple. He left it under the coaster where it belonged, not to be honored, but not denied. There is a difference. He told himself the thing he knew was true: that his work puts him in the path of everything people leave. Some of those leavings are spills. Some are notes. Some are, regrettably, human. That is not a reason to stop, any more than a drip is a reason to abandon a sink. You shut the valve. You grab the towel. You teach the floor how to be dry again and the air how to smell like what you can count on.\n\nThe week put itself to bed, and the next week tried on fresh nonsense like a hat. A woman from Facilities called to ask if he could sanitize the conference room chairs extra hard because a consultant from Calgary had sat in one and declared he\u2019d gotten a rash that smelled like lemon oil. Inez printed a sign for the copier that said, Speak Kindly To Me, I Am Sentient And So Are You, which made three people laugh and one man write a serious email about professionalism. Mira brought him a small pie, savory, with potato and dill and a pastry so short it tried to escape itself, and he took it home and ate it over the sink the way bachelors do when the fork is too far away.\n\nOn Friday he and his father sat on the front step with mugs so hot you had to commit to them and the sky doing that July thing where it pretends to be August. His father told him about a new neighbor with a dandelion army and a hand more suited to painting than to weeds, and Owen told him about learning to pinch dough from a woman whose hands were smooth and strong like rolling pins passed down through too many dinners to count. They did not talk about Joel because there is a limit to how many times you can tell the story of a man who tried to be large and made himself small instead, and because the story had been discussed enough to not be the freshest air. His father touched the mug to his lip and did the small hiss he always does and said, \u201cYou look steadier,\u201d and Owen thought, it isn\u2019t the absence of nonsense. It\u2019s that he\u2019d been reminded nonsense isn\u2019t the only weight.\n\nLate in the evening, as the heat finally admitted it was tired, his phone buzzed with a number he recognized now, not as the anonymous pest, but as an unfamiliar friend. Lowe. You should know, it said, in the bland diction of men who have to put things on paper later, the statements are done. We\u2019ll supervise a restorative thing if both agree. If not, there will be a small court day no one enjoys. He added, on a second line that felt like an afterthought with sincerity peeking through, Your fern was brave. Owen laughed into his empty apartment and wrote back, Thank the fern for me, and then, Thank you. He set the phone face down not in defiance but in the practice of being a person without constant light.\n\nOn Sunday, Brick dragged him to the river valley market in Edmonton, all honks and buskers and gluten-free hope. They walked among the stalls like tourists in their own province. A woman sold honey out of jars like jewelry. A man carved names into belt leather with a flourish. They watched a toddler negotiate with a dog the size of a small horse and concluded the toddler had the upper hand. Brick bought a skillet he didn\u2019t need, which is the only way to buy a skillet, and Owen bought a second-hand novel because someone had written in the margins with a neat hand that disagreed with the author in the kindest possible way. Cannon sent a photo from a different market where he was promoting his brand in a shirt his girlfriend had bedazzled and no one felt threatened by his enthusiasm, which is how enthusiasm should be tolerated in decent places.\n\nOn the drive back, the road did its ribbon thing and the fields lay like content animals and Brick cleared his throat in that particular way large men do when they are about to step into a small feeling. \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone name you with their bad day,\u201d he said, watching a hawk ride a wind he couldn\u2019t see. \u201cMy granddad told me that. He said he\u2019d spent forty years having men try to relieve themselves of their weather by putting it on his back. The best days he just let it go down his coat and onto the ground. The worst days he carried it home and apologised to the table.\u201d He chuckled and shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to apologize to my table. It holds my food. It deserves better.\u201d\n\nWhen he told Inez about the fern note and Lowe\u2019s text and Brick\u2019s granddad\u2019s advice, she listened with her knitting in her lap and miscounted stitches on purpose to show she was paying attention to him. \u201cAll right then,\u201d she said when he finished. \u201cHere is our plan. You will continue to make the world less sticky. I will continue to knit ridiculous items for inanimate objects as my way of rebelling against chaos. We will attend the perogy charity with our faces saying gratitude and our stomachs pretending we\u2019re polite. And when the next person thinks they can write your lines with their thumbs, we will say, no thank you, I have a script.\u201d She held up the goat sweater, which had achieved an armhole by accident. \u201cAlso, what size is a goat\u2019s neck. Tell me you know. You know everything else about this town.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t, and that was a relief. The final night of the month he stood in the quiet lobby after a double-shift that had been less about cleaning and more about moving chairs for a budget meeting that could have been an email, and he let the air settle around him. The glass gave him back a face he recognized, a little older, a little more assured that the way through a story is foot by foot. He turned off the last light with a flick he had perfected and listened as the hum fell to something like sleep. In the dark, his keys whispered. He whispered back, because sometimes that is how you learn where you are in your own plot. Then he walked out into heat that had learned moderation and the smell of mown grass and the distant rumor of fireworks that live in other people\u2019s towns, happy for them the way you can be happy for a neighbor\u2019s luck. He locked the door, checked it without making it about superstition, and headed toward the shape of home with the day under his arm like a folded towel, wrung and clean.Chapter 7\n\nAugust loosened the rope on summer and let it wander, heat pooling in odd places and shadows showing up like late guests who\u2019d been invited by mistake and decided to be charming anyway. The mornings came in thin at first and then laid on a thicker hand, the light less golden now, more brass, precise and unforgiving on scuffed baseboards and the seam where the vinyl met the tile in the second-floor corridor. The building made the sounds of a creature adjusting to a room with one more person than it expected: an extra tick from the exit sign, a new whistle from the air conditioning that had developed an opinion. Owen rolled his bucket slow, listened for what wanted tending, and let his hands find their answers the way they always did, by touching what his eyes had already decided to love back to service.\n\nLowe\u2019s email came on a Monday that had the nerves of a first day of school even though everyone had been sitting at these desks for years. It was brief in the way bureaucratic kindness can be, the necessary nouns and verbs arranged in a steady line. There would be a restorative meeting for those affected by Joel\u2019s choices, if those affected wished to attend. Volunteers would be present from a community organization whose logo was a circle around a tree. There would be tea. Joel had agreed to come. \u201cNo surprises,\u201d the email said, as if preemptively apologizing for the world\u2019s habit of offering exactly that. When he read it a second time in the break room with the smell of burnt coffee attempting to pass itself off as toast, he could feel the nervous animal in his chest put its paws down and tilt its head, listening for the tone beneath the words.\n\nThey met in the church basement that knows the town\u2019s secrets the way a rug knows where people stand when they speak truth. Metal chairs made their spatial music as they shuffled into a circle. In the center sat a basket of objects that looked like the junk drawer at the end of a hard winter: a smooth stone, a knitted square, a laminated photograph of a soccer team from years before Owen moved back, a pen that had stopped writing but refused to be thrown away. The facilitator was a woman with greying curls who wore her reading glasses on a chain like a tiny necklace of authority. She placed a hand on the basket like she was making a benediction and said her name\u2014Rowan\u2014and set the rules on the ground like tools: we speak to be heard, we listen to understand, we pass if we are not ready, the tea is there if your hands need something.\n\nDarlene sat with her shoulders square, a clipboard in her lap because even in the soft rooms she kept one in reach. Inez had come without fuss and brought in a plate of muffins that resembled the planets as drawn by a child in a hurry. Vernon arrived late and tried to fold his height into a chair made for smaller men, his blazer asking for applause even when the man did not. Owen took the chair he could see the door from with ease, not because he did not trust the room, but because he had learned to give himself this small gift without having to justify it to anyone who wasn\u2019t him. Joel sat opposite him, as if someone had drawn a line across the circle and put them on either end to balance the weight.\n\nUp close, Joel looked like a man who had been taken out of his script too early. He had the twitchiness of someone who had told himself three monologues and was trying to decide which one fit in his mouth without making him choke. When the talking piece\u2014a sanded-down bit of wood that felt like a handle to nowhere\u2014came to him, he didn\u2019t grab it so much as let it land in his palm and stay, and his first breath was that sound people make when they finally admit they have been holding one too long.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I wanted it to matter that we were needed,\u201d he said, and the words had the stubborn plainness of two-by-fours. \u201cI wanted someone to realize that the reason there aren\u2019t messes is because someone\u2019s there to catch them. I kept thinking if a thing stank enough people would\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Look up? Notice. Call for more bodies so we weren\u2019t just a name on a list you call when your coffee hates you. I told myself I\u2019d do\u2026 worse if I had to. I didn\u2019t. Doesn\u2019t make the not-worse okay.\u201d He looked at his hands like they had answers. \u201cI sent some of the messages. The ones about the door. The one to you about shine.\u201d His eyes flicked to Owen, met, retreated. \u201cNot the bakery ones. That wasn\u2019t me. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s got that in them.\u201d\n\nOwen let the words come into him, then lay them side by side the way you do with screws and nails so you know what width of hole needs filling. It was a relief and not, to have half the fog burn off and still see a shape standing behind it. He could see the story\u2019s appeal from Joel\u2019s side: the small joy of finally triggering a reaction in a world that begs for invisible hands. He could also see the hollowness left behind when the stage lights you begged for finally breach the dark and you aren\u2019t ready for what your face looks like.\n\nWhen the wood piece came to him, it felt like the handle of a small cupboard door, the kind you open when you want a glass to fill and a place to put it down again after. He hadn\u2019t planned words because planning had never made words better for him, but they came with the same steadiness as a floor wash done properly. \u201cKeys make noise,\u201d he said, and heard Inez\u2019s breath turn into a soft laugh because she knows the sound. \u201cThey whisper and they clink and they say you belong here in the useful way, not the permanent way, and I like that. I like that someone decided I could carry access and not abuse it. I like that you can count on a lock pressed shut as much as you can count on me to open it when it\u2019s time. Your messages tried to turn that into a test, and I hate tests I didn\u2019t sign up for. But I hear the\u2026 want in what you did. I hear the wanting to be seen. I get that want. My mother could make a table sing with a cloth and you\u2019d never know her name if you ate on it twice a week for twenty years.\u201d He looked across at Joel and didn\u2019t make his mouth into anything it wasn\u2019t. \u201cIf the job\u2019s breaking you, change the job you do at the job. Or leave. Don\u2019t break the building to see if anyone loves it. We\u2019ll all clean it, they\u2019ll clap, and you\u2019ll still go home feeling like the wall no one noticed.\u201d\n\nRowan made the kind of sound a kettle makes when it boils for the second time, soft and proud. Darlene, who had been letting her clipboard absorb her glare, put it down and let her hands be hands. \u201cWe can carve you something that doesn\u2019t make you feel like a mop on legs,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s on me as much as it\u2019s on you. Training. Mentoring. You\u2019re right that people see a spill before they see who sealed the floor last week so the spill didn\u2019t stain. We can note the sealing. We can put names on the work. And you\u2019re off after nine for a while. Not as a punishment. As a kindness to me so I don\u2019t have to sit at my kitchen table wondering what door you\u2019re thinking about.\u201d\n\nVernon cleared his throat to insert himself into the scene like a side character who knows his cue. \u201cIf we are doing accountability, let me say on the record that the cones being moved was not the wind, as I publicly speculated to save face. It was children who wanted to make a maze. The children apologized via macaroni cards that still smell like glue. I will be retaining the cards as a reminder that sometimes the universe chooses to surprise you with joy instead of disgust. Joel, I\u2019m not your boss, but I use your work like a clown uses a mirror. I want you to find a better show.\u201d\n\nThey made agreements the way people decide on potluck dishes: practical, a little optimistic, with contingency plans. Joel would spend six weekends supervised at the skatepark with Brayden and the youth group rolling paint over sun-faded tags. He would write apologies to the people who got the worst of the texts, including Owen and Darlene and \u201cthe fern\u201d because Rowan was a woman who believed in naming the whole truth. The union would send a trainer with the patience of a grandparent to teach him the tricks of machines he\u2019d been using like they were enemies. He would not go near the bakery with any attitude that was not pastry-positive for the foreseeable future. If he stuck the plan, there would be no courtroom. If he couldn\u2019t, there would be papers, and anyone who had ever sat in a court knows papers do not care about your best intentions.\n\nAfter, at the table with the tea that had steeped too long and was now medicinal, Inez patted his elbow in a way that also re-anchored him. \u201cYou did good, hanger,\u201d she said, and then added in a voice meant to carry, \u201cAnd in honor of all restorative practices, you may have the last muffin even though it was technically promised to my imaginary goat.\u201d He took it because refusing her gifts felt like throwing a blanket on a cat that had chosen you.\n\nThe bakery took its inspection like a stoic who knows where the bruises will be. The inspector was a narrow man with a generous smile and a thermometer he treated like a friend he trusts to remind him of the truth when he flirts with lies. He introduced himself as Sanjay and complimented the chalkboard menu with an honesty that made the compliment stand taller than the chalk\u2019s wavering lines. He did the system with Mira that people use when they have to check a kitchen that is both a livelihood and a personality: open, glance, test, close, note; repeat; crack a joke about how ovens become divas in their middle age; praise the clean corners, frown kindly at the drain cover that had rusted into modern art.\n\nWhen the thermometer beeped over the trays cooling on the rack, he nodded in the way a man nods when mechanics purr. When the thermometer beeped under and he did his little sigh, Mira\u2019s posture faltered for just a heartbeat. Owen, who had come by with a box of new floor mats bought with his hardware-store discount and an enthusiasm he dressed up as practicality, stood by the sink and used his hands to find the new tune of the valve he had learned months ago. Sanjay asked about labels and Mira produced a label maker that had opinions and began spitting out labels with the gusto of a talkative aunt. Inez arrived mid-ordeal with a roll of paper towels and a temper that frightened bureaucrats into common sense and charmed them into extending deadlines they did not need to extend.\n\nBy the end, there was a list that looked longer than it felt, because some items on lists wear tall hats to look important. Mira had a new timeline for the mats\u2014as if they hadn\u2019t fallen like gifts into her lap\u2014an instruction about keeping a log the way teenagers keep diaries, a promise to replace two cracked containers she\u2019d been meaning to kiss goodbye and hadn\u2019t because morning comes at you like a train. Sanjay signed with a flourish that said he had the heart of a man who secretly acts in community theater and told her what he tells all the bakers he likes: put your thermometer where you see it. Put your signs where people will read them while pretending they won\u2019t. Put your faith in your habits, not in last-minute miracles. She nodded and bit her lip and after he left she leaned against the fridge and let out the long exhale she\u2019d been saving since eighteen.\n\n\u201cYou handled him,\u201d Owen said. \u201cLike he was a cake you were not going to let fall.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was kinder than the last one,\u201d she said. \u201cShe had a soul like a sharpened spoon. He has\u2026 sun under there. Thank you for the mats. Don\u2019t tell me how much they cost or I will both refuse and probably scold you, and neither of those things fits me today.\u201d She fiddled with the label maker and accidentally printed the word cinnamon six times in a row and handed him the strip like a fortune. \u201cYou going to the perogy thing, or are you avoiding babas who will insist on pinching your cheeks and your dumplings.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will be where the onions are,\u201d he said, and felt his stomach get ahead of his mouth, making plans it wanted his brain to honor.\n\nThe community hall smelled like childhood and church basement and the promise of a meal you didn\u2019t have to cook. The stage had a polka band that was two-thirds accordion and one-third grin, and someone\u2019s nephew on a borrowed drum kit who discovered the joy of brushes and chose restraint for the first time in his life. Long tables blazed with plates and the complicated choreography of communal eating, people at different ends playing passive-aggressive tug-of-war with the sour cream. The library\u2019s donation jar sat next to a stack of flyers that had been folded and refolded into airplanes by children who protested the cost of literacy until they were handed a book they wanted to devour and forgot their complaint in the first paragraph.\n\nBrick wore an apron that had been white once in Alberta history and now bore the record of onions and kindness in topography. He handed out plates with a solemnity that made parents trust him to give their children the right ratio of food to food-mood. Cannon had been drafted into emcee duty by a woman with a voice like a scythe and a soft spot for confident young men, and he did the job with a self-mockery that saved him from being a caricature. He introduced the baba brigade like a sports team, complete with nicknames\u2014\u201cThe Crimper,\u201d \u201cThe Speed,\u201d \u201cThe Architect\u201d\u2014and when he called for a round of applause for Svitlana, who had donated thirty dozen of her magic from a kitchen where the countertops sit slightly lower than modern fashions, the roar would have made a smaller town think there was a fire. Owen took a turn at the sink because he knows how to respect a system; he washed until the water ran less onion and more hope, and every time he turned the tap the hose gave him a friendly slap like the hand of a coach telling him he\u2019d make the team if he kept his knees bent.\n\nHe did not compete but he stood at a station where someone had piled the \u201cugly ones\u201d and made it his job to move them discreetly onto plates so no one would feel like they were eating from the reject pile. If the trick to being a person at a charity feed is to carry your own appetite without making it the only guest, he did well. He watched Brick\u2019s face halfway between ecstasy and humility when Svitlana corrected his technique with a laugh that chose to forgive the whole of manhood in one noise. He laughed until his ribs made little protests when Cannon tried to demonstrate a perogy flip in the air and succeeded only in decorating his shirt with a scar of potato that looked like Saskatchewan. He put ten dollars in the jar because eleven felt showy and nine felt stingy, and he told the librarian that replacing the children\u2019s reading rug with something less reminiscent of the eighties would make a lot of knees thankful. When a boy in a hockey jersey stood up in line and announced with righteous despair that he had gotten a cabbage roll in his perogy section, Owen traded him plates without making the boy feel like he\u2019d been rescued from a war. Sometimes heroism is the swap no one else wants to do.\n\nAfter, he walked out under a sky that had left a little lavender for anyone who looked up and found Mira sitting on the concrete stoop, papers fanned out next to her like a flock of exhausted pigeons. She had flour in the laces of her sneakers, which made him absurdly happy, as if he\u2019d caught her in the middle of a sentence that proved a theory he\u2019d been entertaining about her hands. She made a space with her hip without comment, and he sat, and the concrete read their temperatures and decided to even them out.\n\n\u201cI got complimented by an inspector today,\u201d she said, still stunned. \u201cI was going to write it in a journal if I kept a journal. I will instead etch it on the back of my hand like a high school cheater and consult it when I feel that feeling that whispers I am ridiculous and the world will find out.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are ridiculous,\u201d he said, and when she slugged his shoulder with a knuckle the size of a blueberry he caught her grin in the corner of his eye. \u201cIn the way that people doing beautiful things have to be. What are you reading.\u201d\n\nShe showed him the papers facing down\u2014an application for a small business grant that had the earnest smell of government money\u2014and a sketch of the bakery\u2019s back room with boxes arranged in ways that suggested she was courting change. \u201cI want a second oven,\u201d she said, and then looked like she wanted to apologize for ambition. \u201cI want to do more of the things that bring me actual joy and fewer of the things that pay the rent but also flatten me into a person who solves the same puzzle three hundred times a month. I want to hire a kid and pay them decently to learn how to make pastry without tears so that later in life, when everything is noise, they can make a pie and shut the world up for an hour. Is that so wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the opposite of wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is so right I feel I should stand and recite a pledge. You going to ask Vernon for letterhead or will that give the grant committee hives.\u201d\n\nShe groaned and let her head fall back. \u201cI will ask Lowe to write about crime prevention through pastry. He will use the phrase \u2018pro-social glazing\u2019 and the committee will be forced to put me on a poster.\u201d\n\nHis father called the next morning and said, in a voice that had the lilt of a boy planning to run away with a friend, \u201cAre you available to leave responsibility for four hours and go to Wabamun with a cooler and an insufficient amount of bait.\u201d It is difficult to refuse a man who can make failure sound like an adventure, so Owen packed sandwiches that would travel, found sunscreen he did not trust, and met him at the gas station where men stand very close to their trucks and contemplate the price of fuel like it might perform contrition if glared at long enough.\n\nThey drove with the windows down because air conditioning had decided to be temperamental in the way machines do when they wish to be praised for what they still offer. The lake tilted into view like a coin someone\u2019s grandfather pulls from behind your ear, obvious and still magic. They rented a rowboat because the outboard had been loved too hard by teenagers the weekend before, and the young man at the counter had that beaten-but-brave look of an employee who says yes whenever the world tells him to say no. They rowed because it\u2019s good to do a thing that requires every muscle and none of your brain, and the lake laid itself out like a patient that trusted them to do no harm.\n\nThey caught nothing and told each other the old lies because they fit the mouth like hymns. His father told him again the story of the 1956 fish and the punch line\u2014third place in a contest no one remembers and a reputation in a family who remembers everything\u2014and they laughed because repetition is the glue in love. On the slow tack back to shore, his father didn\u2019t clear his throat so much as he pressed a button on his chest that made a different register come out. \u201cI had a letter once,\u201d he said, and watched the oars so he didn\u2019t have to watch his son in the say it. \u201cWhen I was the night man at the high school. Anonymous. Said if I didn\u2019t leave the auditorium door a bit cracked on the night of the spring dance, so-and-so would make sure my\u2026 my lazy work was noted in the board minutes. Spelled lazy with an s like a snake hissing at me. I told your mother. She said, \u2018You tell your own story, not the snake\u2019s.\u2019 I locked the door and sat in a chair with my thermos and read a paperback and when the snake did not get his way he melted and left a smear on the back step that wiped up easy. Those boys\u2014because it was boys\u2014grew up to sell insurance and apologize to my face in the Safeway. I accepted without letting them make me the priest who absolved them.\u201d\n\nOwen listened like a man pulling in a net and hoping not to haul up his own foot. It made something click to hear the line run back that far, to know the town\u2019s foolishness was not new and his position in it was less visionary than he sometimes lets himself believe. \u201cI don\u2019t get to be the priest either,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t mind being the guy with the towel when there\u2019s a spill. You always liked the towel guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all I ever wanted to be,\u201d his father said, and then laughed in that way that makes other people at the lake turn their heads and approve.\n\nThe week rounded its shoulders and carried on, new grooves and old habits braiding themselves into a pattern Owen could trust by feel. Joel\u2019s first Saturday at the skatepark looked like a parable for humility; Brayden filmed a fifteen-second clip that made it to the town\u2019s bulletin on social, a slice of sun and paint and a man being taught to keep his lines straight by a thirteen-year-old with an earnestness that made people forget the anonymous and remember the named. The messages to Mira stopped except the good ones, the ones that used too many exclamation marks because you could taste the sweetness behind them and you didn\u2019t care if punctuation suffered. Vernon sent an email full of capital letters about an Oktoberfest that would happen in September because he refuses to be told by calendar what joy looks like, and attached three spreadsheets that announced themselves as \u201cfun\u201d as if adjectives could perform miracles when asked nicely.\n\nIn the municipal building, the inspectors came, and the chairs were wiped, and the water cooler hissed when its bottle was replaced with the sound of a snake who had decided not to bite. Inez knitted a sleeve for the shared remote control and labeled it Remote Remorse because she had run out of phrases for kindness and was moving into small acts of redemption. Darlene bought new mop heads out of her own budget and sent the receipt to Accounts with the subject line \u201cSanity,\u201d and when the reimbursement came back three weeks later with a smiley face, she framed the post-it because you frame small victories the same way you frame your children\u2019s finger paintings, with seriousness and pride.\n\nOn a Thursday that tried on wind just to see how it looked with the trees, Owen stood in the bakery doorway with a bag he was pretending he had not intended to fill and watched Mira balance a tray on her arm like a dancer who had traded pirouettes for the practical ballet of getting hot things to safe places. The radio was playing something with fiddles that made you imagine flat roads and loyal dogs, and her hair had escaped its long-suffering knot in two places and was doing opinionated curls near her ear. He felt the want that had snuck up on him over months like a dog that had decided he was worth following and decided to do the stupid brave thing and answer it before it wore him out.\n\n\u201cDo you want to watch a documentary about bread with me,\u201d he asked, and his voice came out in the register of men who have seen better attempts in their head and are going to stand by this one anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s very earnest and I think we can make fun of it and also cry.\u201d\n\nShe set the tray down in a way that told him she had not burned herself more than was acceptable for the time of day, and she studied him as if he were a recipe that had forgotten to list the butter but clearly included it somewhere. \u201cThat is the best possible way to spend a night I can imagine and also a terrible way to make me pretend I don\u2019t actually care about it,\u201d she said. \u201cYes. There should be popcorn. And you have to promise not to say \u2018gluten\u2019 like people say it on TV.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will say it like a hymn,\u201d he said. \u201cI will honor its syllables. I will bring the kind of salt that sticks to your fingers.\u201d\n\nThey did watch it and they did both nearly cry when a French man touched dough like it was a sleepy child and they did eat too much popcorn because balance is for mornings with meetings. He fell asleep later with the smell of yeast and butter and television light in his hair and woke up unafraid of his phone, which was a gift he noticed and did not ridicule. When he checked it, it had only a picture from Brick of a perogy shaped accidentally but unmistakably like Alberta, with the caption \u201cfound your province in the pan\u201d and three fire emojis that Brick used sparingly, as all thinking men should.\n\nOn a late night when the building was almost all hushed and the light in the council chamber made the room look like a painting that someone had left on a bus, Owen did the rounds that always bring him back to the start of things. He checked the handles without making it about the old superstition that if you don\u2019t, something breaks purely out of spite. He turned off the last hum with a touch he had perfected and knew he\u2019d miss if he ever left, the way you miss a particular banister when you move houses. In the dark, the glass did its trick and gave him himself without the polite lies light tells. He lifted his keys and they made their aural confession, honest and small, and he confessed back without words. Outside, heat had made friends with night and the air smelled like cut grass and the faint ghost of someone grilling two blocks over. He walked toward home with his day folded under his arm like a towel that had done its work and would be clean again in the morning, and he let himself be exactly as okay as he was, which turned out, for a Thursday, to be more than good enough.Chapter 9\n\nSeptember walked in with its collar up and its hands full of apples. The mornings started late and ended early, and the daylight in between lost that summer swagger and became something more precise, like a teacher tapping a board with a pointer. The municipal building felt it in its bones. The air vents found a new rattle, the glass held handprints longer, and the hall outside the council chamber kept a faint smell of pencil shavings that arrived with committees and left with arguments. Owen carried his bucket like a man bringing water to a tiny, thirsty republic, and the mop head fanned itself across tile in straight gospel lines. By eight he\u2019d talked to three different stains about redemption and to one maintenance guy about a hinge that insisted on singing in B-flat when it closed.\n\nThe town did its seasonal costume change without any fuss. Vernon hung a banner in the lobby that said OKTOBERFEST in letters so cheerful they needed to be sounded out twice, and then marched out the door with two clipboards and a look that suggested clipboards might mate in captivity and produce little clip-children. Inez knitted in primary colors and declared she\u2019d begun on a second goat sweater because the first had turned out less like a garment and more like a friendly puzzle. Darlene taped a note to her own door that read No, I Cannot Approve Your Pumpkin Spice Use of the Copier, Love You, which drew three laughs and one carefully constructed complaint from a man who could write official emails about anything.\n\nMira\u2019s chalkboard took on gourds. She drew a pumpkin that was somehow both smug and self-conscious and wrote, Be kind to each other and to pastry, the former being difficult some days, and the latter being an insult to pastry if attempted without tenderness. The afternoons in the bakery were warmer than outside, proof that ovens change the seasons on their own schedule. She had the grant application spread across the back counter one Monday like a map of a place she\u2019d never visited but wanted desperately to say she\u2019d been. It was the unromantic kind of paperwork, the sort that asks you to count things you haven\u2019t counted before: hours on task, kilograms of flour per week, the number of times a day you reach for a bowl that would be better placed four inches to the left.\n\n\u201cYou ever notice how math is both infuriating and reassuring,\u201d she said, pencil behind her ear and an inch of focus in front of her that nobody got to touch. \u201cIt\u2019s like, here, quantify your dreams, and also, look, your dreams can be quantified and now you can move them around on a piece of paper until they fit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve noticed math can save you from your feelings,\u201d he said, stealing a glance at the oven clock like it could keep time on his behalf. \u201cAnd then your feelings crawl back in from the side door and ask if you\u2019d like some tea.\u201d\n\nShe smiled without looking up, and he felt that small victory sit honestly in his stomach. They had watched the bread documentary and been both cynical and moved in the right proportions, and now their conversations had pockets, secret and useful, they could reach into when a day required it. He didn\u2019t call it anything; he didn\u2019t have to. Words like Beck and Courtship sound like Victorian letters and turn perfectly good realities into plays.\n\nVernon\u2019s Oktoberfest was not in October, which he said was a tradition if you said it into a microphone and people clapped. He booked the hall for the second Friday in September because he\u2019d been outmaneuvered by a quilting convention and took the defeat with the grace of a man who would one day name a pavilion after himself. The plan involved oompah at a polite volume, sausages sourced from a German grocer tucked beside a tire shop, and a beer garden that would serve a local lager in biodegradable cups that promised to break down nicely in landfills like well-behaved ghosts. He wanted string lights, three food trucks, a polka lesson, and a mercy station for men who wore their leather shorts ironically and found irony cold.\n\nOwen watched the setup with a fondness that had very little to do with the event and everything to do with the way a town makes a stage out of what it already has. He hauled barricades like they were furniture for a room he\u2019d one day get to sit in, and he told a teenager how to untangle extension cords without cursing them into snakes. The cool in the air made the cords feel like obedient rope, and when the bulbs blinked in sequence, the lights made the parking lot look suddenly European if you squinted and had a generous heart.\n\nHe was thinking about mirrors and floors and that particular way dusk falls over rectangles of asphalt when Lowe slid up beside him like an apology that had found its place. \u201cTwo things,\u201d the constable said, and offered him a timbit like a peace offering he hadn\u2019t asked for and was glad to receive. \u201cJoel\u2019s made it through two Saturdays without sabotaging anything more significant than his own ego, and a grandmother named Svitlana made him cry twice in one afternoon by calling him honey and showing him how to hold a roller. Also, the bakery texts seem to have stopped. Not idle hands. Something more like distracted hands. Whoever it was has moved on or been moved.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou talk to all your suspects like that,\u201d Owen asked, not wanting to give relief too much of the stage in case it took advantage and refused to exit. \u201cDistracted hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tell part-timers to keep their hands where I can see them, and I tell worry to sit on the back step,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cYou good if I bring my girl to the polka thing and teach her how to step without stepping on me. I want her to know a little ridiculous is the only way to carry adulthood.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ever the picture of composure,\u201d Owen said, because he has learned that teasing is love if it lands right, and Lowe\u2019s grin took it in like a dog given its favorite word.\n\nThere were small dramas and none grew teeth. Vernon\u2019s rented sound system fought him for two hours and then suddenly decided to be agreeable, like a cat you\u2019ve humiliated yourself for finally stepping into your lap. The bratwurst arrived two hours early and had to be convinced to nap politely in warming trays, which they did until one burst in protest and gave a teenager a story. A woman in a dirndl made from what had once been an Ikea curtain told Cannon she wasn\u2019t impressed by his chewing speed and then asked for a selfie, just to keep the universe on its toes. Brick learned to polka in a way that used all his corners and half of his caution, and when he got it right he looked like a house learning to float. Owens\u2019s father came for an hour, insisted he could waltz over a polka any day, proved it on the corner near the beer tent, and then bowed with a flourish that made three women decide he was charming and one man decide that maybe he did understand what it was to carry a day without complaint.\n\nIn the midst of this, there was a quiet thing. Mira stood at the edge of the lights with a paper cup of beer she would not finish, the foam marking how sentimental she was willing to get. She had on a cardigan that had seen winters and a skirt that carried conversations. She caught his eye, then let it go, then caught it again, and when he crossed over the asphalt in three steps because the music had made his predictability take a seat, she held up a piece of paper folded into a square as if it were a small creature she\u2019d chosen to release or keep.\n\n\u201cThey want me to come and pitch in person,\u201d she said, and kept her voice steady because if she let it wobble the whole world would wobble with it. \u201cI sent the numbers, and now they want to see the person who wrote the numbers. The man in the office said, \u2018We like a story to go with our spreadsheets,\u2019 and I didn\u2019t tell him the story was that I can cry at the sight of flour measuring itself into a bowl.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to go and talk about dough like it\u2019s destiny and they\u2019ll give you money because even people who count coins for a living have mouths and you can feed a mouth into a mind,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t, you\u2019ll make the second oven happen anyway, and someday they\u2019ll buy your column in a newspaper that still allows language that tastes good.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a menace when you\u2019re supportive,\u201d she said, but could not help the way her mouth softened in appreciation. \u201cYou and Inez and your father is going to show up and clap from the hallway, isn\u2019t he.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will pretend to be part of a tour and then stares at the wall and cry a little,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will bring him a muffin to excuse his presence.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease bring him two muffins,\u201d she said. \u201cI need him on my side of the ledger.\u201d\n\nThe week that followed was the kind that looks ordinary from the sidewalk and turns out, upon closer inspection, to be full of small shifts. Joel\u2019s restitution moved from awkward apologies to a kind of workmanlike relief. He fixed a handle in the community center that had squealed for a decade and looked two inches taller for having made something better with a screwdriver and a promise. Brayden took to following him like a well-intentioned mosquito, buzzing with ideas for how to improve the flow of people at events and the positioning of trash cans to maximize compliance. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you put the cans in a circle and call it art,\u201d Vernon said, overhearing and slipping into the conversation in that way he has of arriving just after he\u2019s needed to be there, \u201cif it gets us fewer ketchup tragedies.\u201d\n\nThe bakery had its own tiny revolution. A second-hand store in Devon closed in mourning after the last of its bruise-colored cardigans had been bought and the owner decided fishing was a better use of shoulders. In the back, an oven sat with a sign taped to it that said, Works Fine, We Just Stopped. Mira heard about it via the intricate grapevine of women who have moved towns but not lost their capacity to know where the good things are. She wanted the oven and didn\u2019t have the truck or the arm strength alone, and Owen made the calls, and Brick arrived with a borrowed trailer and the grin of a man who loves nothing more than a heavy object and permission to lift.\n\nThey made an afternoon of it. They wrapped the thing in moving blankets like overprotective aunts, they strapped it down so gently that the oven would later say, if it could speak, it had never felt so safe, and they drove that ugly metal beauty along back roads that made the journey feel like a secret and a promise. Mira sat in the lead car and refused to look back because if you look back at cargo you love, you invite fate to show off. Owen watched the mirror because that is how he functions in the world: forward, sideways, backward, keeping three narratives stitched to a single road. They arrived without mishap, which felt like a miracle only because so many things don\u2019t, and they slid the oven into the bakery with the hush of a large thing deciding to be home.\n\nIt told the room it was a worker, not a diva. The old oven gave it a look that said, we will either be friends or partners who irritate each other professionally, and the new oven preheated like it knew it was being tested. Mira fed it a small tray of shortbread as a courtesy. The kitchen filled with that butter sum that can make a funeral bearable and a Tuesday less mean. Sanjay, notified via text and lured by the scent like any sensible man, dropped in with his thermometer holstered like a peacekeeper and approved it by giving it a nickname. \u201cShe is a Lark,\u201d he said, patting the side with professional affection that could yet be denied. \u201cDo not question my instincts. She will sing for you.\u201d\n\nShe did. The second oven cracked the bakery\u2019s day open in a way Mira had expected in a spreadsheet and still couldn\u2019t quite believe in her hands. The racks filled with twice the number of croissants and yet none had to be rushed; the pies baked in pairs like twins who don\u2019t mind sharing toys; the morning felt less like a sprint and more like a steady run with breath you could keep. She wrote her pitch for the grant between turns of dough and smudged adjectives with butter without apology. She practiced aloud once, only once, in the back room with her hair feral and the flour motes drifting like a snowfall that had forgotten its season. Owen heard the rhythm from the front and felt something like pride that you get to feel only if you\u2019ve held a flashlight in someone\u2019s flood.\n\nBecause the world does not believe in a single plot line for a life, the day of the pitch was also the day of a minor pestilence. The municipal building\u2019s second-floor men\u2019s room decided to have feelings about its plumbing. At nine, it gurgled as if remembering a song. At ten, it lied and pretended it was fine. At eleven, it attempted to cascade. Owen was there because of course he was, with towels folded precisely like the Navy teaches and a plunger with a handle he\u2019d sanded down himself because splinters are a metaphor nobody needs. He shut the valve by feel and by muttered encouragement, and he stood in rubber boots while water made its case and lost, slow enough for a man to maintain dignity and fast enough that the floor didn\u2019t need a sermon, only a mop.\n\nIt was not how anyone wants to spend an hour, but it was a kind of blessed contrast. Mira texted him a thumbs-up as she walked into a room full of folding chairs and three people in business casual making their own faces presentable to strangers. He texted back a picture of a towel and the words Holding the line, which is what it always is. She stood at the front of the room and told them about ovens and mornings and the geometry of circles you fill with fruit and hope, told them about teenagers who need a job that is both simple and exacting so they can practice focus without a screen, told them about the economy of cities that understand that bread and coffee are not extras but infrastructure. She did not cry because the part of her she\u2019d prepared did not need to, and the part of her that gets weepy did so later in the stairwell where no one would think they had caused it.\n\nShe came out with practical instructions for next steps and a look he would come to recognize, a look that said, whether or not they said yes, I was true to my own version of events. They all celebrated as if the yes had already arrived because there are days you need to lead a cheer into the room and let the yes catch up later. He brought his father, who acted casual, and Inez, who did not, and Brick, who ate four cinnamon rolls and cried twice during a polka that came on the radio by accident. Cannon came by with his girlfriend and let Mira put him behind the counter for five minutes; he froze at the register in the way giants freeze and then recovered with an apology so charming no one could hold it against him.\n\nThe grant committee\u2019s yes came by email on a Tuesday as the leaves began to commit to their yellows. It was not dramatic. It did not come with balloons or an official knocking on a door the way you might fantasize when you\u2019re twelve and the world feels like a comic book. It came with three bullet points and a PDF attachment and a request for proper receipts. Mira sat on the back step with her phone and made a sound that was two parts laugh, one part relief, and stirred it with a fork. She texted him the three letters and a photo of her shoes, and he got the message on a ladder in the lobby changing a bulb and had to make a decision about whether to climb down to be dignified or to shout from the rung. He climbed down and went to the bakery and she kissed his cheek with a quiet he knew not to narrate.\n\nOver at the skatepark, the restorative Saturdays grew less performative and more real. Joel had begun to bring small things from home to repair more small things on site\u2014a screwdriver with a handle that fit his palm, a roll of tape that seemed like it might save a life if wrap were a category of sacrament\u2014and the kids needed him less for instruction and more for presence. Brayden declared him \u201cnot awful\u201d in front of his friends, which anyone who knows teenagers knows is a benediction, and the older men who leaned on the metal fence pretending to supervise learned to say hello without an edge. Lowe stopped by and watched from the shade, making himself perfectly ignorable, and let a half-smile haunt the corner of his mouth when a boy said to another without meaning to be profound, \u201cIt feels better when it looks better,\u201d because there it was, the slogan for every effort undertaken by people like Owen and Joel and all their quiet kind.\n\nOne message found its way under Owen\u2019s door that month, a last vestige of anonymity that felt more like a habit than a threat. It was a list torn from a spiral notebook, spiky handwriting that had learned in school to be legible and had since chosen drama. It said, Be careful who you help. It had no signature and no return to sender, and he read it, then read it again, then set it under the coaster on his table with the photograph from months ago. He did not send it to Lowe because he did not want to build a case on crumbs. He did tell Inez, who sniffed and said, \u201cEveryone who writes on spiral paper like that thinks they\u2019re the hand of fate. If fate has a hand, it does not choose budget office supplies,\u201d and then knitted faster, which is her way of cursing in public.\n\nMore days stacked. He built and rebuilt the path from door to door, swept and mopped and buffed, and took satisfaction in the way the floor tells you when you\u2019ve done it right without asking for thanks. He and Mira sat in her kitchen on a night that was finally cold and ate soup like it was a form of justification. They made a game of naming everything they were grateful for that wasn\u2019t a thing you can take a picture of. He picked the silence right after a laugh that means you\u2019ve hit something true; she picked the moment when a room takes your shape and relaxes because it recognizes you. He said the smell of his father\u2019s tea, never the taste. She said her landlord\u2019s habit of telling bad jokes and then apologizing to the room for having told them. He laughed until his throat went soft and then admitted he had begun to think of the bakery as a place he could keep his hands, like a bench with his name written under it in pencil.\n\nOctober chose not to enter quietly after all. The first cold morning fogged the windows with wet breath and pretended not to be winter. Vernon announced, because there are always announcements, that he had booked a choir for the pumpkin lighting, that there would be a prize for the best carved gourd that was not scary because the yelps of children are fun only in their first syllable, and that he needed someone to hold a ladder because the fairy lights he\u2019d borrowed had opinions and those opinions were hung four inches out of his reach. Owen held the ladder because of course he did. Brick held the other side and shouted exaggerated cautionary phrases every three seconds to make the children laugh and the parents relax into their posture. Cannon arrived with a box of donuts and was tolerated because he is both chaos and on-brand kindness, and all the teenagers with phones filmed the lights going on like they had never seen lights do that before, which is one of the lovelier lies we tell ourselves.\n\nMira lit the first pumpkin and pretended not to like being asked to. She allowed the moment on her face and then filed it away under the section in her head labeled Things You Don\u2019t Have to Talk About to Keep. Her second oven sang softly; you could hear it in the tone of her day. The grant money arrived in pieces because money never arrives all at once unless you are being struck by a bus or hit by fright, and she counted it like prayers and spent it like strategy. She ordered a stainless table and a second mixer that looked like it could pull a tractor, and she hired a teenager who came with a reference from Brayden, which is to say she came with a willingness to be teased and a capacity to take instruction without dissolving. She named the girl Tully in her head because the girl had misheard a greeting and replied, \u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d and sometimes a town gives you your name whether you are prepared to legally accept it or not.\n\nIn a week stitched together with sleep and sugar, Owen\u2019s father turned seventy, though he refused to say the number out loud because numbers are fun until they aren\u2019t. He agreed to a cake at the bakery against his own inclination, and what followed was less a party and more a visitation. People came by as if they had appointments and he said hello to them as if they had just dropped off a book. Mira made a chocolate cake that was not austere and not silly; it was serious fun, and the frosting shone like a polished shoe. Inez wrapped a bow around a tin of cookies and told him to open it in an hour because some pleasures require a schedule. Lowe dropped a card in Owen\u2019s pocket addressed in small precise letters and escaped back into the warm. Brick hung back because he felt too big for the room, then came forward when Owen pulled him with a look, and told the old man that his son was the sort of man who quietly saves entire days and never tells anyone, and the way his father said, I know, had Wednesday mornings and long-ago thermoses in it.\n\nThe message under the coaster didn\u2019t turn into a pattern, and that was perhaps the point. Not everything will. He caught himself hoping it had been a final fling of attention and not the opening of a new act, and then he told himself not to practice dread like it was an instrument worth learning. He promised himself instead to keep doing the thing he knew how to do, to mop and to lift and to look, and to say yes to the things that got his heart to move forward. He said yes to one more polka where he and Mira pretended their feet were smarter than their heads and it turned out their feet were kind. He said yes to a small road trip to pick up a set of shelves from a woman who used the phrase \u201cshabby chic\u201d without irony and who fed them orange slices in a way that made the day feel like a kindergarten class. He said yes to an early morning when the sky cracked open pink and a man with a broom watched the light make the dust on his floor look like glitter for half a second before it became ordinary again.\n\nThe pumpkin lighting happened under a sky that understood the assignment. Dusk took its time and let the choir\u2019s breath rise in white puffs that made the notes look like they might have a body. Vernon tried to coordinate six things with eight hands and succeeded because five other pairs of hands appeared where needed, and the teenagers who used to move cones for sport now moved them into perfect lines as if they had been converted to a religion whose saint is Flow. Joel was there, standing beside Brayden with a posture that didn\u2019t need a special vocabulary, and when they nodded at Owen across the lights it wasn\u2019t a secret handshake so much as an agreement among custodians.\n\nThey lit the pumpkins in a line that looked like a sentence the town was writing to itself. The faces were not all pretty. Some were aggressively goofy. One looked like the artist had despised the world that day and tried to carve it into submission. One had no face at all but had been turned into a lighthouse with a careful chisel and a battery-powered candle. Children squealed in the right way and a dog barked twice and accepted the night as arranged. Brick couldn\u2019t stop grinning and Cannon managed to hand a donut to a crying toddler without being accused of interference in the child\u2019s necessary developmental crisis. Mira leaned into Owen\u2019s shoulder in a way he nearly didn\u2019t notice because it is sometimes how a life sneaks by: with the normal weight of a person you already know by smell.\n\nAt the very edge of the evening, when the last plastic cup had been chased across the parking lot and the lights hummed with that end-of-shift music they make when they know they are about to go dark, a woman Owen did not recognize watched him coil an extension cord and approached as if asking a favor were a hobby. She was in her thirties, maybe, younger if you were generous, older if you had spent any time looking into faces and counting the inches of history. She had a coat that would not be warm enough in an hour and a posture that said she was about to tell a story she both wanted and did not want to tell.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the janitor,\u201d she said, and he nodded because a man should agree to his place in the scheme of things at least once a day. \u201cYou work with Darlene. You\u2019re\u2014Halvorsen.\u201d\n\n\u201cOwen,\u201d he said, watching without staring because you can learn as much from what people are not asking for as you can from their words. \u201cYou need a mop or a key or a hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cA key,\u201d she said, not smiling. \u201cTo something else. I\u2014All right. I did some dumb. I sent some things I shouldn\u2019t. Not to you. I mean. To the bakery woman. The texts. I thought\u2014who knows what I thought. I thought she took something from me that was mine. It wasn\u2019t mine, it was an idea and you can\u2019t own ideas any more than you can own a sky. I thought I was making the playing field even because she had a line out the door and my cupcakes looked like a funeral even when it wasn\u2019t one. Then\u2026 I saw her at the inspection that day. The man was so careful with her. It made me feel like a clumsy person in a china shop. I\u2019ve been sticking receipts under her door like a teenager and you can tell me to go take a long walk off a short ridge. I\u2019m tired of carrying a story that isn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nHe stood still because this is what you do when truth approaches with its hat in its hand. He waited for the part where she named herself, because that can make the difference between repair and ritual. \u201cHeather,\u201d she said after a pause, and the name fitted the look if you knew old high school yearbooks and the way hair gets cut when you can finally afford to pay someone to not make you look like your aunt. \u201cHeather Woldt. I do cakes in Stony. Weddings. I thought. I got so scared that she would\u2026 I don\u2019t want to be the villain in a town with this few villains. You tell me what penance is. Don\u2019t tell me to be her friend. We are not the same kind of people.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t want to be the priest. He remembered, from the boat with his father, how easy it is to assign yourself the mantle of forgiver and end up wearing it like a costume that doesn\u2019t fit. \u201cYou tell her,\u201d he said. \u201cYou tell her in a way that doesn\u2019t make her do any work to comfort you. And then you leave her alone unless she asks you to do something different. And you make your cakes like the world depends on them, which it does for the two hours people cut them and say vows. I will tell Lowe because I promised him I\u2019d tell him about puzzle pieces. He will act like it\u2019s not a big deal and then he\u2019ll write it down because that is how he remains sound. And you stop using anything but your name. If you can\u2019t, you come here at nine on a Wednesday, and Inez will look at you until you do the right thing.\u201d\n\nHeather laughed and then made the face of a person surprised by her own laugh. \u201cInez is a witch in the best possible meaning,\u201d she said in a tone that intended respect. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll go tell the pastry woman I was awful. She will either network it into a polite handshake or strip me of my epidermis with her eyes. I will accept either.\u201d\n\nWhen she\u2019d gone, with her coat not warm enough and her step resolved, Owen felt the place behind his lungs light and dim like the pilot in an old furnace. It wasn\u2019t triumph. It wasn\u2019t even relief quite. It was that gentle shift you get when a long, small wrong tips back toward right, and you don\u2019t have to hold yourself at an angle anymore. He told Lowe and let the man be thorough. He told Mira and let her be kind without being a doormat. He did not tweet or post or tell Brick because it wasn\u2019t story for entertainment; it was the workplace of forgiveness, and you don\u2019t take pictures there.\n\nThe pumpkins softened over the next few days, as pumpkins do, and the town passed small decrees about when it is appropriate to throw beauty into the compost. The wind found a new edge, the sky traded one blue for another, the bench outside the municipal building grew cold in the morning and then warm and then cold again. The perogy charity sent a thank-you card with far too many exclamation points because gratitude cannot be calibrated when onions are involved. The second oven learned the voice of Mira\u2019s days and made it easier for her to stand up straight. The keys in Owen\u2019s pocket made their soft map of a man\u2019s movements, and he traced it not as a routine but as a practice.\n\nOne evening he took his father to the footbridge behind the arena where you can watch the pond consider freezing and the geese plot their commute. They stood with their hands in their jackets and their breath in front of them, and said the kind of things two men say when a month has been both eventful and ordinary. \u201cI get to be useful,\u201d Owen said, not being specific because he didn\u2019t need to be.\n\n\u201cYou always did,\u201d his father said. \u201cIt\u2019s just easier to tell now. It shows better in this light.\u201d\n\nHe thought about light and how it gives, how a floor absorbs it and throws it back, how a window accepts it and shares it, how a pumpkin hoards it for a while and releases it like gossip. He thought about the bakery, about the municipal building, about the reef of chairs in the council chamber that he could navigate in the dark with only his knee. He thought about Mira\u2019s hands and the way they make circles that change the mood of an entire room. He thought of promises made to angry texts, to leaky valves, to plants with cameras behind them, to men who\u2014given instruction and a team and a forgiveness that had structure, not sugar\u2014remembered how to be part of a town instead of its antagonist.\n\nIt was enough, for that month, to walk home with the smells of October in his scarf and to have nothing louder to report to his own head than the inventory of his day. The front step had leaves gathered at its crook like gossiping aunts. He swept them into a pile and let the wind have some because partnership is all, even with breezes. He hung his keys on their hook and the sound was the one he\u2019d known since he\u2019d learned to listen for it. He made tea badly and buttered bread properly. He set the photograph back under the coaster and whispered nothing in particular into the room, which received it and sent it back in the form of a quiet that was not empty. He slept without waiting for his phone to light, his ribs at last behaving themselves like a choir after rehearsal, and dreamed only of floors that gleamed because someone loved them by hand.",

                              "content": "The city creaked awake under a sky like a stretched bedsheet, blue and cold at the edges and pale where the sun pressed its hand through. A dew-slicked truck idled behind the municipal building, coughing a ribbon of white that the wind shredded and sent along 1A toward the trees. Inside, lights hummed their quiet neon hums, and a man with a mop and a knack for humming along ran the mop head under the tap and shook it mostly dry. The floor, the glass, the tiny constellation of crumbs under every chair\u2014these were the universe right now. Spruce Grove at five-thirty was a kingdom of keys and the soft squeak of rubber soles. Not romantic, but then some romances are slow.\n\nOwen Halvorsen worked in splotches of concentration. He could focus so hard that the clock failed to move, or he could drift and find himself an hour lighter without a clue what path his thoughts took. He liked being first in a place, liked the rawness. The night janitor had left him notes on pink paper: Missed corner behind the filing cabinet, sorry. Coffee exploded in the second-floor corridor AGAIN. God bless the woman who drew three smiley faces to soften the facts. He smiled back in his head and took his bucket, wet as a lake with soap water and the smell that promised citrus and probably killed very small organisms in shock.\n\nAs he worked, he considered pies. This was an old habit, like pocketing bottle caps and turning them over to see what they hide, or whistling without meaning to. Pies were circles. Pies were decisions made with hands and heat and timing so precise a whole afternoon could go wrong because you blinked. Pies were comfort and competition and the time he\u2019d won a ribbon at a charity event because he could eat a blueberry pie faster than any of fourteen men and three brave women with faces adorned in purple like war paint. That was two summers ago. He could still taste the berries. He could still feel the wild, childish grin when the crowd clapped for nothing more profound than a man finishing something he started.\n\n\u201cThere he is,\u201d said Inez, materializing in the hallway like a ghost in a beige cardigan. She moved as though the building were her instrument and she played it quietly. \u201cAlready in your gospels, Owen? The Book of Mop?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say that like mop isn\u2019t sacred work,\u201d he said. It might have been, depending on the day. Some days he loved the way a dull tile could be convinced to shine. Some days his wrists ached and everything felt last on the list. He wasn\u2019t twenty anymore, wasn\u2019t fifty either, but the clock had teeth.\n\nInez peeked into his bucket. \u201cThat water looks like Old Man Winter let his dog in. When\u2019s your break?\u201d\n\n\u201cTen minutes,\u201d Owen said. \u201cGot all the glass to do first. The city likes seeing itself in its own reflection.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always had a mouth on you,\u201d she said, but warmly. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to eat. You\u2019re a hanger.\u201d\n\n\u201cHanger?\u201d He knew, but she liked saying her words.\n\n\u201cA hangry man. A hanger. It\u2019s not the worst thing to be.\u201d She patted his arm and drifted toward the council chambers, smoothing a plastic runner like it was a silk sheet in a hotel no one could afford. \u201cYou hear there\u2019s some kind of fair next weekend? Out by the ball diamonds. Music and booths and a petting goat, I imagine. I\u2019ll knit that goat a sweater if someone gives me ten bucks.\u201d\n\n\u201cPetting zoo at the community fair. That\u2019s real.\u201d He\u2019d seen the flyer, only it wasn\u2019t the goat that had caught him. It was the photo of a pie with the crust crimped like a careful child\u2019s art project, edges pinched so perfectly they looked machine-made.\n\n\u201cOh, and they\u2019re doing a pie thing,\u201d Inez said, as if she\u2019d plucked the thought from behind his ear. \u201cEat until your stomach sues for divorce. You going to show them how it\u2019s done?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Owen said. He tried to sound casual. He felt like a schoolboy with a note burning in his pocket.\n\nHe worked the squeegee down the glass doors and watched the sun change the town from suggestion to detail. The parking lot gathered cars; a man in an orange vest stacked cones like the start of a great and temporary monument. A woman with a clipboard scolded her phone. He liked being apart from it, but not too far. The mop water went down the drain like a promise fulfilled. He ate his sandwich at ten exactly in the break room, the sugar packet someone had spilled under the kettle glittering like a corsage for the floor, and he Googled \u201cSpruce Grove pie eating contest rules\u201d on his will-of-the-wisp cell service. He found the fair\u2019s page, with fonts that suggested enthusiasm but screamed budget. Qualifiers Thursday night at the community arena. Finals Sunday. Waiver required. No hands allowed. No puking. Cleanup provided. The prize: a ribbon, a trophy shaped like a pie slice, and a cash envelope that would make a small dent on a credit card bill. It wasn\u2019t about the envelope. It never really was.\n\nIt was about being seen, his mother would say if she were still phoning him in the mornings. But she wasn\u2019t, and sometimes that silence made more noise in him than anything else. His father, a quieter man, still called on Sundays and inquired about the weather like the weatherman\u2019s script and then slowly sketched out the real talk, the worries, the small glories. Dad would not be impressed by a pie trophy. But he would come and clap, because that\u2019s what fathers like his do. He\u2019d clap once at first, politely, and then when he thought he was alone on the second clap he\u2019d let it be a cheering sort of clap, too many claps for a man of his reserved nature. Owen could see it. He could hear the old man\u2019s truck rocking on the gravel as they left, his dad saying, \u201cWell, there\u2019s something you can tell your grandchildren when you have any, which you absolutely will if you stop judging women based on their pie opinions.\u201d\n\nHe laughed out loud at nothing, startling Inez, who peered at him over a stack of municipal notices like a prairie owl.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t fall down in that giggle fit,\u201d she said.\n\nHe didn\u2019t.\n\nHe finished his shift at two with a soreness he catalogued as manageable. He clocked out and shrugged into his denim jacket because evenings even in June could be a trick, a tease, a last-cold breath. The Blue Spruce Bakery was three blocks down and implicitly part of his route home. He didn\u2019t have to stop, but he always did. The window had a hand-painted tree that someone with more confidence than skill had done, the needles a little too bright. Inside, the smell convinced you good choices existed and could be eaten with a fork.\n\nMira was behind the counter with her hair in a knot that said she had fought with it and won. She had a face that gave away her reactions in an honest way, like a good book with the last page missing.\n\n\u201cYou again,\u201d she said, squinting, which he had learned meant she was pleased to see him but refused to make a big deal out of it.\n\n\u201cMe again.\u201d He tapped the glass case. \u201cThat one. The\u2014what is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cSaskatoon berry,\u201d she said, handing him a paper bag as if by magic. He hadn\u2019t seen her reach for anything. She moved as if the bakery were her body and the cinnamon twists were fingers she fidgeted.\n\nHe paid in coins as he often did because something in him liked the sound. It was old-fashioned and he knew it. She counted the coins with the rhythm of someone who had done this in high school at a craft fair when no one was watching.\n\n\u201cWhy do you come here when it\u2019s clear you\u2019re a Tim\u2019s man?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear?\u201d He held up his coffee like a man caught at a crime.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear from your eyes, which are glassier than any normal person. That is not quality brew,\u201d she said, and slid him a wink and a small chocolate cookie he hadn\u2019t ordered.\n\n\u201cI like both,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m entering a pie-eating contest. I need to survey the field.\u201d\n\nShe leaned across the counter. It made an almost-private place for his words. \u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look like\u2026\u201d She waved a hand in a way that might have been an apology.\n\n\u201cI know. But you don\u2019t have to be a tank to eat pie fast. You have to have technique. You have to have heart.\u201d He said it to make her laugh. It was only half a joke.\n\nShe bit her lip like she was trying to not smile, and failed. \u201cWell, heart. Okay. Where is this happening?\u201d\n\n\u201cCommunity arena. Thursday night. They do the qualis. Finals Sunday at the fairgrounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll make it,\u201d she said, as if it were as easy as paying rent. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a look. Like\u2014\u201d She squinted again. \u201cLike the guy nobody bets on. Not an insult. They will cry later when they see your secret ninja gut.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not tell my gut you said that. He\u2019s sensitive,\u201d Owen said. They traded the paper bag and a second joke and the impression of fourteen others unsaid. What a piece of fluff. What a relief.\n\nThat evening he jogged, badly, along the path that skirted the pond where ducks made meetings of huge importance and teenagers carved new names into old wood. He ran a lap, then another while a country song on someone\u2019s radio did its job. There were rules in the event that took the fun out and gave the fun back: no water after the start, no hands, lean over the plate, chew enough not to obstruct, a judge-making faces at you if you tried to cheat with smear tactics. He had learned things from internet experts: chew in rhythm. Work the crust first. Fruit pies go easier than meat; meat clogs you up and turns your face the exact shade of regret. He tried breathing patterns while he ran. In through the nose. Out through the mouth. He felt stupid and no one noticed.\n\nThursday arrived like a dare.\n\nHis boss Darlene\u2019s office was a glitch of plants and a stapler that had seen wars. She had a stack of time-off requests most of which looked like letters to the editor written by people who had very strong opinions. She had also a heart as surprising as it was matter-of-fact, if that made sense. \u201cSo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need Sunday off. Exchange shift or whatever.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nShe peered at him. She had the kind of eyes that saw things you hadn\u2019t learned yet. \u201cIt\u2019s your fair. Go eat pie. Don\u2019t come in here Monday with your face blue and ask me for hazard pay. But seriously. Have fun. You don\u2019t take enough days.\u201d\n\n\u201cI take a Saturday every week.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 not how weeks work, Halvorsen.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\nHe left with a promise to text if he were detained by glory.\n\nThe community arena had fluorescent lights that made everyone look like the winter version of themselves. The echo of his steps reminded him of being ten and afraid of nothing except a ball coming at his nose. People gathered in small clusters among the folding chairs and the booths selling kettle corn and homemade jams decorated with gingham that no one had asked for and everyone expected. A sign said PIE EATING QUALIFIERS in letters that wanted more ink than the marker had left.\n\n\u201cContestants check in here,\u201d said a teenager with a bored professionalism he admired. His name tag said BRAYDEN with the Y underlined twice like an inside joke. He passed Owen a form that said he wouldn\u2019t sue anyone if his esophagus made a decision on its own. Owen signed it with the flourish of someone who hadn\u2019t signed anything interesting since the lease. His number was 11, which he decided he liked.\n\nBeside him a mountain moved and it turned out to be a man. Red beard, shoulders like a couch, hands with muscle memory for lifting either weights or whole cows. He had a laugh like someone dropping a toolbox into another toolbox. \u201cFirst time?\u201d he asked and it sounded like he was asking how the weather was.\n\n\u201cSecond,\u201d Owen said. \u201cLocal one two summers ago. Charity thing. It was\u2026 organized.\u201d\n\nThe big man gave a knowing nod. \u201cBrick,\u201d he said, by way of his name being Brick. \u201cFrom down the road in Stony.\u201d\n\n\u201cOwen,\u201d he said. They shook. Brick\u2019s hand was not for show. \u201cYou\u2019ve done this before.\u201d\n\n\u201cA few times,\u201d Brick said. \u201cAnd yet I keep coming back. You\u2019d think a man would learn. You got any tricks?\u201d\n\n\u201cChew in threes,\u201d Owen said, surprising himself.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s cute,\u201d Brick said, not mean. \u201cMy trick is don\u2019t die.\u201d\n\nA small, birdlike older guy prowled past them in a blazer he couldn\u2019t possibly afford, speaking into a walkie like it was the last walkie on earth. \u201cWhere\u2019s my cranberry? Where\u2019s my blueberry? Who stole my rhubarb? Team two is delayed, we\u2019re delayed, we\u2019re fine. Smile. Smile.\u201d His expression suggested he had never smiled on purpose. He was a human who had lived most of his life next to a megaphone.\n\nWhen they called number 11, Owen\u2019s chest rattled. The stage was not a stage. It was a long table with six plates and six pies and a tarp on the floor that would later be folded into itself like false modesty. The judge, a man with a clipboard and a face that wanted to be somewhere else, explained the rules again. The crowd was not large but it made noise in the manner of a larger crowd. Some nights you get applause that forgives things you haven\u2019t done yet. He tipped his baseball cap backward and stepped up to his plate.\n\nBlueberry. He had hoped. It stained, but it went down in a willing manner.\n\n\u201cHands behind your backs,\u201d the judge said, cheerfully enough. \u201cOn three.\u201d\n\nHe set his elbows on the table to anchor, shuffled his feet into fighter\u2019s stance though he would never fight for any reason but to end a fight, and on three he went down like an old time boxer with a plan.\n\nThe pastry scratched his top palate. He did the tongue thing he had practiced, pushing crust parts to the side, slurping filling in small vacuums of sound, forming bites with his teeth that would not get him in trouble with his own throat. It wasn\u2019t pretty. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be. He found the rhythm in his jaw. He let the crowd be a blur and the judge\u2019s whistle be a suggestion. He tilted his head and the pie followed, sliding like a hillside in the rain. He smiled into the tin, which surprised him; who smiles into a pie tin? He had to breathe; he breathed. He got crumbs in his nose and didn\u2019t panic. He kept going even when the man at number 9 made a gagging sound that scared a mother in the front row. He kept going even when his brain told him this was ridiculous and he should be ashamed of himself and also more ashamed for believing this mattered. He kept going because\u2014why stop? Because we stop so often for no good reason, and here was a reason to keep moving your mouth and your heart and then a slice later he was done.\n\nHe was done before number 9, more or less at the same breath as number 4. Brick at number 12 thumped the table with a hollow boom of completion and shooting stars of blueberry rose up like confetti. The judge called times in a bored voice that made the numbers more holy. Owen had not won the heat; that went to Brick by a tick and a half. He did not expect his legs to feel like kelp. They did.\n\nMira materialized at the edge of the stage like a fairy godmother if a godmother wore flour on her jeans. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that was you,\u201d she said, and laughed and pressed a napkin at his chin. \u201cBlue beard.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou came,\u201d he said, which had been the hope he had stuffed into his sock.\n\n\u201cI closed early,\u201d she said, not looking at him when she said it, because she was not sure how that would land in either of their chests. \u201cIt gets slow after six anyway. Also, my landlord is in that audience and I would like him to see me and remember I exist when I ask for the plumbing to be less enthusiastic.\u201d\n\nThey called out names and numbers, and the man in the blazer turned his face into a cheer. \u201cAdvancing to Sunday,\u201d he said, \u201cwe have our group one qualifiers: number 4\u2026 number 11\u2026 and number 12!\u201d\n\nThe crowd clapped. Someone who didn\u2019t know where to put their energy whooped. Owen\u2019s name sounded strange under the arena lights, like when your own voice comes back from a canyon. He lifted a sticky hand and then lowered it quickly when he remembered where that hand had just been. The moment was larger in his head than it looked in the air, but it existed, and he put it in his pocket, safe.\n\nBackstage, which was only a curtain hanging a little crooked, Brick whistled low. \u201cYou\u2019re dangerous,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m decent,\u201d Owen said.\n\n\u201cYou moved like you had a plan. That\u2019s rare, around here. Mostly it\u2019s dudes with hubris and dental insurance. Sunday will be a field, though. People come out of the woods for finals. You ever met Cannon?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll know him when you see him. He\u2019s the one with the fan club. And the foam finger his girlfriend made that says \u2018Chomp.\u2019 Ridiculous. You hungry?\u201d\n\n\u201cI just ate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not food,\u201d Brick said. \u201cThat is performance art and regret tomorrow morning.\u201d\n\nThey laughed. It wasn\u2019t friendship, not yet, but it was league membership. Mira waited by the exit, the late June evening dragging stripes of peach and lavender across the horizon like a painter who got lost in the color section.\n\n\u201cYou were good,\u201d she said. \u201cGood-good. Not just for a guy from here. Good.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d He wiped his face again. Blue persisted in crevices he had not known he owned. \u201cThere were some older ladies in front who weren\u2019t quite sure what they were applauding for.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey came for the quilt raffle and stayed for the bloodsport,\u201d Mira said. \u201cYour input?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring them muffins to apologize,\u201d he said, and then felt at once like he was joking and not. \u201cSunday. You\u2019ll be there?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the pipes behave,\u201d she said, and made a face. \u201cAnyway, congrats. Your fan club can\u2019t afford foam fingers, but\u2014\u201d She lifted her hand and wiggled her fingers in the air, shaking them like seaweed in a current. \u201cJazz hands.\u201d\n\nHe got home to his apartment that smelled like garlic no matter what he did. His neighbor in 301 had invented a new way to burn toast. He showered in water that couldn\u2019t decide if it wanted to scald or sulk. He called his father, because some things held you up by their mere existence, and said, \u201cI got into the finals,\u201d and his father said, \u201cOf what,\u201d and then \u201cOh,\u201d in that careful neutral that meant he was deciding whether this was one of those calls where he should pretend to be thrilled or where he could breathe and be honest. Owen helped him by keeping it simple.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come,\u201d his father said. \u201cI\u2019ll clap. And I\u2019ll tell you it isn\u2019t food. But I\u2019ll clap.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Owen said. \u201cI know it isn\u2019t\u2026 anything big. It\u2019s the principle.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of life is principle,\u201d his father said and laughed. \u201cThat and keeping your receipts. Drink water. I don\u2019t understand why, but I think it\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nHe went to bed early and didn\u2019t sleep because the nervous little animal that lives beneath a man\u2019s ribs needed to run. He dreamed the dumb dream where you\u2019re on stage and you realize you\u2019ve forgotten to put on pants and the stage is a pie crust. He woke laughing and then sat on the edge of the bed with his head in his hands and let the laugh turn into something like a prayer.\n\nFriday crawled. Saturday he did not train because he listened to a video online that told him rest is training too and he let that be true. He ate something green and something white and something brown and wished for a diagram that told him in percentages what each thing did once it got in there. He cleaned a dentist\u2019s office after hours and felt a weird surge of solidarity with the tools lined up like silver toys. He told Inez, who told him good luck as if he were leaving to sail around the world on a canoe.\n\nSunday he wore his shirt with the least suspicious stain. He laced his shoes like he\u2019d be asked to run. The fairgrounds had grown a fair since Thursday. Tents blossomed; the air had a growl to it, generators working. The scent of onion and sugar and dust was old-school and undeniable. The stage for the finals was an actual stage, with an actual banner that did not blow off in the first breeze. The emcee was the blazer man who had found a second blazer. He held his mic like an extension of his nervous system.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, and anyone and everyone in between or beyond, welcome to the Spruce Grove Summer Days Pie Eating Finals!\u201d he yodeled. \u201cGet your stomachs right and your hands off these pies. The rules are posted. The pies are partly forgiving. The judges are fair. The cleanup crew is\u2014brave.\u201d\n\nOwen met the other finalists behind the stage where a volunteer gave them small bottles of water and said, \u201cNot after you hit the plate,\u201d in a tone that suggested she had lost at least one wet sneaker to a man who forgot. Cannon introduced himself simply by existing, a blonde block of a man with a smile he\u2019d practiced in the mirror. His girlfriend did indeed have a foam finger. It did indeed say CHOMP. Brick rolled his eyes so hard it was audible. \u201cDon\u2019t let them get in your head,\u201d he said, not exactly quiet.\n\n\u201cThey make shirts,\u201d Cannon said, overhearing without taking offense. \u201cIf they make shirts you can sell them online, and then my boss gets off my case about hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a business plan,\u201d Brick said. \u201cI respect it, I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is more than your gut will respect you after this,\u201d Cannon said and thumped Brick on his back in a gesture that almost knocked him into next week.\n\nMira found Owen as a volunteer tied a bib around his neck, a ridiculous accessory that did exactly what it was supposed to do. \u201cBreak a leg,\u201d she said, and then her face went thoughtful. \u201cNot that. Break\u2026 a record. Break a\u2026 pie. Don\u2019t break anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nHe was not sure. He was.\n\nThe first pie was saskatoon berry. It crumbled differently than blueberry, a skitter of seeds he didn\u2019t hate. The second pie was apple, which had that baked bite that required more chewing and thus more precision than a man wanted in such a situation. The third was\u2014pecan? He raised his head, and the judge\u2019s eyebrow did a thing that said, Be grateful, son. He readjusted his strategy mid-chew, which is a ridiculous sentence and also exactly what he did.\n\nBrick was steady, Cannon was fast. Owen found that his rhythm from Thursday came back like a song you liked too much to forget. He could see nothing but his plate, and in his peripheral the toe of someone\u2019s shoe that had a hole in it, and beyond that something like the roof of the world. It was absurd and he recognized that in real time. It was also as real as anything. He leaned, he chomped, he breathed. He thought of his father\u2019s small smile, Mira\u2019s jazz hands, Inez and her knitted goat sweater. He thought of his mother adjusting a table runner, because she would, and telling him not to be ridiculous but making sure the sun fell on his plate just so.\n\nHe made it through the second pie in good standing. He had time. He was going to possibly\u2014he didn\u2019t let his head go there. Focus is a room with no windows.\n\nHalfway through the third, his mouth did something he didn\u2019t ask it to do, a small gag sound like an uninvited violin in a punk band. He breathed through. He saw the judge notch something on his clipboard that might have been a judge version of a prayer. He dug in again, slower, and Brick came level and then past him by a half-lap around the tin. Cannon had jam all over his nose and joy all over his face. The crowd made a noise like a collective knee being knocked against a table.\n\nHe did not win. He did not come second. He came third, and the emcee threw his arm around Cannon and declared him a legend, and confetti made of paper and regret fell, and someone in the front row clapped with two hands and a foot, and it was all more than and less than he had imagined it might be.\n\nOwen did not mind. Or he minded in a way that did not damage his day. He wiped his face and looked for Mira because that was what his eyes wanted. She was there, half-smile in place, her eyes a little warmer than the air. Brick shook his hand and squeezed. \u201cYou\u2019ll get them next year,\u201d he said, which was a kindness and also a way to say what else are we doing but coming back to try again with a different shirt.\n\n\u201cNice work,\u201d Cannon said, and meant it. \u201cYour chew in threes? I saw that. I like a method man.\u201d\n\nHe laughed and let the laugh stay. The emcee handed out ribbons and the trophy to Cannon, who kissed it like it had a mouth. People milled. The generator whined. The sun did what it does in June and refused to go to bed on time. Owen took his participation certificate and folded it into quarters that were ungently neat and then remembered he was supposed to wear his ribbon for the photos and tried to untangle it like he was in a romantic comedy with a shoelace.\n\nIt came to him with the force of a clear sky that he was okay. That\u2019s a stupid sentence, and so what.\n\nHe sat on the edge of a hay bale that was exactly wrong for sitting and chewed his lip and thought what a deliciously odd path this was, from a bucket and a mop to here with blueberry under his nails and a small soft light in his chest. He thought of calling his father and saying third, old man, your boy got a bronze in something your wife would have laughed all morning about. He thought he\u2019d text Inez a picture of his blue stained grin. He thought he\u2019d take Mira out for ice cream and talk about anything else.\n\n\u201cIs it crass to sell pies here?\u201d Mira asked, dropping down beside him, two spoons and one dish in her hand like a dare and a gift.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exactly right,\u201d he said, and took a bite and winced when cold stabbed his forehead and then he laughed at himself for being the person who can eat three pies in ten minutes and loses his mind over a single lick of ice cream.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s to dignity,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd to losing it,\u201d he said.\n\nThey clinked their plastic spoons like wine glasses and when the emcee shouted into his mic about a lost child named Lucas who was not lost anymore, the crowd applauded as if Lucas had conquered a mountain. Maybe he had. Maybe finding your mother in a crowd when everything is taller than you is a kind of Everest. Owen\u2019s phone buzzed and his father\u2019s text read, Simply\u2014saw you on the livestream, your aunt sent the link. Proud. You looked like your grandfather. He wiped his eyes with the back of his hand and blamed the wind.\n\nOn the walk back to his car, he passed the cotton candy machine spinning sugar into clouds and the tired men at the ring toss resetting rings like sins forgiven. He passed a poster for a community theater production and another for a blood drive. Life intersected with itself and made a pattern that did not make sense up close, only stepping back. He could already feel tomorrow\u2019s stiffness. He could already feel the need, gentle but present, to return to mops and glass and the corners you miss when your head is somewhere else. There was relief in that. There was the comfort of a list.\n\n\u201cHey, Halvorsen,\u201d someone called, and he turned and Brick jogged up, every step heavy and solid, like a promise that didn\u2019t break. \u201cSome guys are doing a charity thing next month. Perogies this time. You in?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerogies?\u201d He let the word sit on his tongue like a prayer bead.\n\n\u201cPerogies,\u201d Brick confirmed. \u201cDifferent skill set, same thrill. Think about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll think,\u201d he said, and he meant it in both the way people say I\u2019ll think when they\u2019re politely bailing and the way some decisions sit in the pocket for weeks before you realize you said yes in your sleep.\n\nWhen he got home, he set the ribbon on the table and then moved it to the top of the fridge because the table needed to be for eating and the ribbon needed to be for something else, undefined. He showered blue away until his skin was mostly his again. He slept as if he had been running. Monday the building would greet him with its ordinary shine and its not-shine, and he would be there with the itch under his skin that the fair had started. He would move. He would mop. He would hum. He would think of Mira\u2019s hands making the littlest circles with pastry and of his father making tea too strong and of we\u2014whoever we were\u2014being okay.\n\nAnd because the world creeps in on soft feet even when you shut the door, a text pinged from a number not in his phone. Nice work out there today, it read. Shame if something, say, unexpected messed up the next big thing. He blinked. The text had no name. The number was a scramble. He considered that this was a joke from Brick or Cannon or some kid who wanted to see what happens when you poke a guy who likes pie. He considered ignoring it. He did. He put the phone face down and listened to the neighbor\u2019s television leak life through the wall. A show where people chased houses, a show where people cooked. He laughed in his chest and then out loud and then quieted. He could feel the fair still on his skin, like glitter you never entirely get rid of.\n\nInez would tell him he was being dramatic when he told her the story later, probably Wednesday because Tuesday had its own personality. Mira would roll her eyes like a kind of yes. His father would say, what did the text actually say, and he would read it to him and hear the silence that means you\u2019ve stepped into a plot someone else thinks is theirs. He told himself people play jokes. He told himself this wasn\u2019t a story. The ribbon on the fridge made a small shadow on the wall like a flag in wind. He fell asleep with the scent of flour in his hair and the taste of sugar at the back of his tongue, and the city outside turned down its volume, and somewhere else in town someone was stirring a pot with more intent than flavour.",

The sky leaned toward ordinary blue, and the truck behind the municipal building was already gone, leaving behind a seam of damp on the asphalt where its shadow had been. The lights clicked awake in sequence and the hum layered up until the building sounded like a polite hive. Owen let himself in and the keys did their whispering work. He liked that sound. It said you belong here in the practical sense even if everything else about belonging is less certain, and it said this is a job you can finish if you keep at it, which is not nothing on a day where you need a sentence like that to prop you up.\n\nThe pink notes on the board were fresh, Inez\u2019s tidy print a balm and a prod. Chair leg scuffs. Someone tracked mulch through the northeast hallway, why. A doodle of a cat, because she couldn\u2019t help herself. He cracked his knuckles like a man about to play the piano and rolled his bucket to the tap. The water went cloudy the way it always did at first and then cleared as if it had remembered itself. He tipped in the measured slosh of soap and the air shifted toward citrus and chemical righteousness. He thought of the text and told himself not to think of the text. He thought of the ribbon on his fridge, a little flag that had no country to fly for. He thought of pie in a way that made his stomach tilt, the way your stomach reminds you it is a creature with a personality.\n\nIt\u2019s a prank, he told himself as he pressed the mop to tile and taught the tile to shine again. It\u2019s a kid with a fake number and time on their hands. It is not a plot. This is a town where plots involve garden beds and the occasional fundraiser. He heard his own voice in his head and knew he sounded like a man trying to be reasonable in front of an unreasonable feeling. He put the feeling under his heel with the dirt and pushed.\n\nBy the time Inez arrived, cardigan buttoned wrong and then corrected, the building felt like a routine you could set your watch by. She had a tote bag with a cartoon goat on it and the words You\u2019ve Goat To Be Kidding Me, which she claimed she had not bought for herself and was a lie no court would uphold.\n\n\u201cYou look like someone hit you with a bag of sleep and missed,\u201d she said, handing him a wrapped muffin the size of a hockey puck.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very specific,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd accurate.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll accept a kindness in the morning and then get philosophical on my lunch break,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s our deal. How was your circus yesterday? I watched a live stream until my internet remembered it lives in a basement apartment under a freeway and a thunderstorm.\u201d\n\n\u201cThird,\u201d he said. \u201cBronze in blueberry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThird? I would have bet you fourth,\u201d she said, and when he cocked an eyebrow she patted his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s my way of making third sound better than expected so you don\u2019t feel the need to punch a locker. Proud of you, hanger. You did the thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, and the thanks had weight. He put the ridiculous muffin in the pocket of his jacket because he would forget it otherwise and find it in November.\n\nHe told her about the text because not telling her felt like holding your breath for no reason. The words came out more dramatic than they had sounded in his head, as if saying a thing always makes it grow a little. Her face didn\u2019t do alarm, not at first. It did the calculation of a person whose life has introduced them to a handful of stupid human behaviors and taught them not to jump at shadows but also not to ignore a shape in the dark with a hat on.\n\n\u201cShow me,\u201d she said, reaching for his phone with the casual authority of a nurse. He handed it over and she read the message twice as if it might rearrange on the second pass. \u201cKids, mostly. Sometimes adults being kids. Could be one of your new\u2026 professional acquaintances. The big one with the name like a construction material. What is it. Brick. He seems kind, though. The blonde one seemed like a handshake you don\u2019t want.\u201d\n\n\u201cCannon,\u201d he said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t\u2026 He was fine. His girlfriend wears foam, but he was fine.\u201d\n\nShe nodded, satisfied with her personal taxonomy of men. \u201cStill. Save the number. If they send another thing, we go to a person with a badge. Not because I think it\u2019s serious, but because I slept less last night than I will ever admit to another soul and it made me unkind in my head. It\u2019s always fine until it isn\u2019t and then you wish you told someone before. And because I like saying to people with badges, here is my evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can call Dad and tell him I\u2019ve collected evidence,\u201d he said, half a joke, half a practice run for later.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll make tea too strong and tell you to get a dog,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a dog. You need new socks and a vacation and for the city to replace that mop head more than once a season. Run along. Go make the glass a hymn.\u201d\n\nHe hummed while he did it, because the building demanded hums like some people demand background music to decide how to feel. Outside the morning arranged itself into its usual parade. Men in neon vests stacked orange cones. Women with lanyards clutched coffee and purpose. A boy on a bike streaked a line between cars like a comet that refused to learn. The text sat in his pocket like a coin he wasn\u2019t using because he didn\u2019t know if it was lucky or a trick.\n\nAt ten he ate the muffin because he had to honor the covenant of a gifted baked good and because if he did not, Inez would quiz him later like a mother hen with a degree in interrogation. It was bran with cranberries that pretended they were cherries when they wanted to impress you. He texted his father a photo of the ribbon against his fridge door and wrote Third. The reply came five minutes later, as if his father had needed to stare at the picture and make a decision about jokes. A man came third in 1956 and is still mentioned in the family storybook, his father wrote. That man caught a fish, but pie is more elusive. Proud of you. Keep receipts. He laughed out loud and scared a squirrel on the window ledge into having a moral crisis.\n\nAfter his shift, he headed toward the Blue Spruce because a habit is a road you like, and also because some days you need to stand in a smell that remembers that life is not just work. The bakery window was fogged around the edges as if the place were thinking hard. A handwritten sign that was not usually there hung cockeyed on the glass: Closed for an hour\u2014plumbing tantrum. He put his hand to the cool pane because he had the childish superstition that you can comfort a building through its windows. It made no sense and felt right.\n\nHe knocked gently with a knuckle as if that were somehow different than knocking with a fist, and Mira appeared from the back like a woman pulling herself through molasses. Her face was a storm you could see the sun behind. She let him in with a gesture and a sigh that had tiny knives in it.\n\n\u201cIf you tell me you\u2019re good with wrenches, I will marry you out of gratitude and then we can get divorced after the pipes behave,\u201d she said, half in jest and half in a low-dosage plea.\n\n\u201cI can mop with the best of them and I can Google with the rest of them,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\n\nShe took him to the back where the world was a chaos of flour ghosts and wet footprints. Someone had shut the water off, then on, then off again. The floor was a small lake with islands of stainless steel table legs and a population of guilty-looking towels. The sink had a look of innocence that sinks practice when they\u2019ve done something without meaning to. He squatted to look under it the way a man does when he has no real plan and found the shutoff valve slick with something that was not water. He touched it with the tip of a finger because the part of his brain that says don\u2019t touch glistening things was on break, and he lifted his finger to his nose. It had a smell he knew: a whisper of WD-40, garage-flavored and smug.\n\n\u201cDid you oil your valve for fun this morning?\u201d he asked, and when she frowned he said, \u201cIt\u2019s slippery. Like someone greased it. Makes it easier to turn, I guess, or harder if you have wet hands and a temper.\u201d\n\nShe looked at him the way people look at a puzzle piece that fits too neatly. \u201cWhy would anyone\u2026 Why.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaintenance? Gremlins? A landlord trying to be helpful? A teenager with a can and a YouTube education?\u201d he said, listing the spectrum because listing is a way to keep panic from building room additions.\n\n\u201cLandlord can\u2019t be bothered to put felt pads on the bottoms of stools,\u201d she said. \u201cTeenager, maybe. Gremlins would have left me a note. This was on when I left last night. I am almost positive. And this morning it was off and in the middle of mixing the fourth batch for a guy who needs three hundred mini tarts like today is the royal wedding, it went on and then it didn\u2019t want to be off and then\u2014\u201d She waved at the floor like she was introducing a guest on a talk show.\n\n\u201cDo you want to call anyone?\u201d he asked. \u201cBesides me, which does your heart credit but might be unwise statistically.\u201d\n\n\u201cI called the plumber, he is in Devon until three and then he will be in a mood,\u201d she said. \u201cI turned off what I could turn off. The main is in the basement that belongs to the pizza place and the pizza guy is in Fort Saskatchewan visiting a mother who cannot be reached. I am living in a sitcom episode with B-plots and a laugh track. Can you\u2014could you\u2014just hold this flashlight while I convince this pipe to choose a personality.\u201d\n\nHe stayed two hours, squeegeeing water toward a drain that did not know the meaning of hurry, ferrying trays to higher ground like pies were refugees, holding a light while she did something that involved plumber\u2019s tape and a prayer she did not say aloud. They found a small note under the back door, folded once, that had blown itself into a puddle and disintegrated into a sullen rectangle. It had been a receipt, probably, for flour or coffee or something with tax on it. It turned into paper stew in his hand and he stood there with pulp and an expression that he would have laughed at if he could see himself.\n\n\u201cYou got a text,\u201d he said, when there was a lull and the floor looked like it might forgive them. He said it in the way you mention weather with a subtext. \u201cLast night. From a number that didn\u2019t sign itself. Said something about the next big thing being a shame if something messed it up. I ignored it because that was the choice that kept me from feeling like a drama queen. Now your sink is a hobby.\u201d\n\nShe straightened and leaned her shoulder against the cool stainless and closed her eyes in a way that wasn\u2019t fatigue but a recalibration. \u201cYou think that has anything to do with this. That\u2019s a leap with good sneakers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I am not at my most rational in the hour after a flood,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think I am doing that thing where coincidences turn into conspiracies because feelings want company.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got one the other day,\u201d she said, and then laughed like the laughter surprised her. \u201cA text. Not exactly like that. More like: Open late this week and see what happens to your nice ranking on the local mom group. Which is weird because I have never asked the local mom group to rank anything. I thought it was an ex-coworker being petty. Or a competitor thinking I was coming for their wedding cake game, which I am not, because brides scare me. People get weird around the concept of fondant.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s two texts,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is not a hundred. But is two.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt could be the same weirdo,\u201d she said. \u201cIt could be two separate weirdos, which would be statistically fascinating and also make me want to lie face-down on the flour sack and wait for a century.\u201d\n\nHe was quiet because the room needed a space that wasn\u2019t words. The drain finally decided it could be a hero, just for a bit, and the lake receded into a respectful puddle. The air took that post-rain smell that feels like a signed apology. He set his squeegee against the wall and wiped his hands on his jeans and looked at the back door again. The lock was the cheap kind you buy in a hardware aisle while grabbing batteries, and the jamb had a scuff at shoulder height where you might bump it if your hands were full. He touched the scuff and it flaked under his finger, one of those paints that never truly bond. He could have made a case for anything and so he did not make a case.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cIdea. You keep your phone on you in your apron like you do. If anyone sends another love letter, we take it to someone whose job is reading love letters that are less loving. Inez will murder me if I let a plot twist happen without telling her. Also, I can bring you a nicer squeegee.\u201d\n\n\u201cA nicer squeegee,\u201d she said with a straight face. \u201cYou know how to woo a lady.\u201d\n\n\u201cI woo with squeegees and sandwiches stolen from the break room,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, I can sit with the door if you want to grab a shower. You smell like determination. It\u2019s a good smell. It is also flour-based.\u201d\n\nShe made a face that held gratitude and mortification in equal measures and went to wash the streaks of the morning off her forearms while he stood in the back with his hands in his pockets and listened. He could hear the bakery front bell chime without customers as if remembering how. The fan over the oven turned its steady circles, sounding like someone deep breathing their way through a mild panic. A kid skateboarded by outside with that clack that makes a whole day sound teenage. He stayed until the plumber arrived and proclaimed all pipes to be mysteries he had learned not to trust and charged a fee that looked like a number you could divide by three pies. When the plumber left, satisfied that nothing would burst while he was twenty minutes away, Mira slid Owen a paper bag with something heavy in it and a look like, let me give this and you don\u2019t argue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m paying you in tarts,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is medieval. It is what I have.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was here because\u2026 I wanted to be,\u201d he said, and heard how that could be read in ten directions. \u201cAnd because your sink attempted a coup. And because I know how to hold a flashlight.\u201d\n\n\u201cEat the tarts,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if you think you never want sugar again, which is adorable. And if you get another thing, you tell me. I will bring my rolling pin and my meanest customer service voice.\u201d\n\nThey stood in the doorway for a minute like a pair of cats who had concluded a treaty. He thought he should tell her she was the kind of person other people send weird texts to because she makes a place people want to be, and some people who cannot make a place get large feelings about those who can. He did not say that because today did not need more words with teeth. They settled for a nod that felt like a plan.\n\nThat evening Darlene called as he was lacing his shoes for no reason except that laces on shoes feel like control. \u201cYou got room in you for a last-minute? Community center\u2019s begging. The mayor\u2019s thing is tomorrow\u2014breakfast with muffins and people wearing polite faces. They want a sweep tonight because some\u2026 youth with a can tasted the thrill of aerosol art. It\u2019s not a mess-mess, but it\u2019s a mess to someone important. I\u2019ll throw it to you with a little hazard bonus if you say yes. If you say no, I will throw it to Joel and then we will all live with Joel\u2019s version of sanitized.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can, yeah,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat time?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn an hour,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd wear your be-seen vest. They want you to be a presence. Ridiculous. As if scrubbing in a vest deters teenagers. Take your keys. Have a good time.\u201d\n\nThe community center had a distinct echo, less jovial than the arena, more municipal. Its halls smelled faintly of chlorine because proximity to the pool makes whole buildings go aquatic in character. He found the spot in the back corridor where someone had sprayed their practice tag, a looping name that could have been BOLT or BOAT or BOZO depending on your faith in curves. The paint was fresh and arrogant. He put on a mask because a man who has spent years breathing ammonia and regret learns to protect what he wants to keep, and he went to work with solvent and rag and patience. The loop softened and bled and then broke, and underneath a ghost version of the letter stuck around like a memory that won\u2019t quite leave a family.\n\nA man in a blue blazer\u2014maybe the same blazer, maybe the blazer had multiplied\u2014appeared at his shoulder and made a noise like a sigh that wanted attention. \u201cVernon,\u201d he said by way of name, as if introducing himself to a microphone. \u201cEvent coordinator. You\u2019re\u2026 the guy with the mop from the other thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cOwen,\u201d he said. He scrubbed and did not give the man the full theater of eye contact because paint does not wait for social niceties. \u201cWhat\u2019s the other thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pie nonsense,\u201d Vernon said, and smiled in a way that said he didn\u2019t entirely mean nonsense but the word had gotten stuck on his tongue. \u201cYou had a\u2026 presence. Thank you for performing for the city. Speaking of performance. We\u2019ve had some mischief. Nothing criminal, I am told, by people who do not understand that this is my reputation we\u2019re discussing. Extension cords go missing like socks in a dryer. A banner unfurls to say WELCO E with no M because someone decided the M could have a private life. Bleach in the mop bucket and then suddenly there is bleach on my hands for the rest of the day, why. Things that make me look like I don\u2019t have hands on things. And then today this, which is just\u2014\u201d He gestured at the wall as if the paint had insulted his mother.\n\n\u201cDid you put a better lock on your storage,\u201d Owen said, not accusing, but asking like a man whose life has taught him you get what you lock.\n\n\u201cHa!\u201d Vernon said. \u201cBudget. This place runs on ten kinds of earnest and two kinds of tape. But yes. We are upgrading. We are generations deep in padlocks. It\u2019ll be fine. If you see anyone with a can or a conspiratorial hat, tell me. You have the look of a man who sees things.\u201d\n\nHe did not say that seeing the things other people don\u2019t want to see is the job description of a janitor. He did not say that his job had trained him to hear the sound of a spill two rooms away and know its viscosity by the way it hit tile. He said he would keep an eye out, and he meant it.\n\nHe finished, left the wall a little cleaner than it had been and also a little bruised, the way surfaces always are after being corrected. On his way out, he ran into Brick in the lobby reading a bulletin board like it was a philosophical text. Brick wore a T-shirt advertising a barbecue that had happened last September and a pair of shorts that could have been a boat in a pinch.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re everywhere a man could be that sells tickets,\u201d Brick said. \u201cYou cleaning this place too? You are going to live to ninety with the lungs of a bassoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody painted a word that wanted to be BOLT,\u201d he said. \u201cVernon is having a day.\u201d\n\n\u201cVernon lives in a permanent day,\u201d Brick said. \u201cHe dates drama like it\u2019s good for his skin. You get any weird messages yet or was that wishful thinking on his part. He told me someone keeps moving his cones so the safety pathway looks like a cat designed it. He thinks it\u2019s personal. I told him sometimes the wind makes choices.\u201d\n\nHe told Brick about the text because he was curious what the man would do with it. Brick scratched at his beard and made a noise that said he was reserving judgment but offering sympathy.\n\n\u201cPeople get odd when they see someone take a bite out of any kind of stage,\u201d Brick said. \u201cNot just pies. I got a lady in Drayton Valley who sends me scripture about gluttony every time I put my name on a sign-up sheet for charity. I tell her I\u2019m raising money for the library and she tells me libraries are dens of iniquity because they lend out romance novels. We live in a time. If someone says, do this or I\u2019ll do a drama, you go to a grown-up and tell them. Cops. Venue. Your dad if he carries a large wrench. Don\u2019t invite the game onto your porch and then complain when the raccoon opens your garbage.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood advice,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you just call me a garbage can.\u201d\n\n\u201cI called all of us a garbage can,\u201d Brick said, with the ease of a man comfortable with metaphor. \u201cWe hold things for the world, they overflow, and then we get a raccoon. Cannon would tell you to film the texts for content and monetize your anxiety. He\u2019s not entirely wrong. Hey, perogies. Think about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking,\u201d Owen said. \u201cBetween now and when I\u2019m eighty.\u201d\n\nHe drove home with the smell of solvent on his hands in a ghost way that all the soap in the world never fully fixes. His father called on schedule and the conversation did its dance, weather, the fact that a cousin\u2019s second child had decided to be a bassoonist, money that behaves like a cat that only likes you when you\u2019re not looking, and then the text because Owen owed him the truth and himself the relief of saying it out loud to a voice that had steadied him since he stood on a chair to reach the tap.\n\n\u201cIt said what, exactly,\u201d his father said, and Owen read it to him in the bald form of things. \u201cI would be tempted to call Constable Lowe and say, here is a thing, and brush your teeth, and then go on with your day. He will tell you it is probably a teenager. He will write it down in a notebook that smells like institutional coffee and he will tell you to keep him posted. It is not nothing and it is not an emergency unless it becomes one, and then you will wish you had a notebook entry somewhere with your name and the word told. Bring Mira a better lock for that back door. I will pay you back if you need me to feel involved.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need you to feel involved,\u201d he said, and smiled to hear his own teenage voice in there somewhere. \u201cBut I accept the lock as a family project.\u201d\n\n\u201cDone,\u201d his father said. \u201cDon\u2019t go inventing enemies because your life tried on a stage for a weekend. But don\u2019t let someone else decide to make you part of theirs. Be careful. Eat a vegetable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ate a bran muffin.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t count,\u201d his father said. \u201cBut it tries. Good night.\u201d\n\nHe slept like a person in a train that doesn\u2019t stop in his town, half aware of motion and the occasional station name called out in a voice he couldn\u2019t parse. He woke to Tuesday trying to be a joke about Mondays and failing. The mayor\u2019s breakfast had a tablecloth piety to it, and the building wanted to stand a little straighter. He did the extra pass over the corridor where dignitaries would glide, and he collected his bucket with the feeling that you get when you look under the couch and find both a penny and a receipt for something you had meant to return.\n\nOn the way past the front desk, he saw a new note in someone\u2019s hurried hand: Remember: media at ten. Be kind. Be brief. There was a drawing of a microphone with rays around it the way kids draw the sun, as if sound were a warm thing. He straightened the stack of pamphlets and made the chairs stand like a platoon. He did not know why he felt protective, but he did.\n\nThe first text of the day came at nine-twenty, when the room was a soft uproar of muffins and introductions. Nice work on the scrub job, it said. You\u2019re good at making things look like nothing happened. Do you want to keep being good at that, or do you want to see what happens when no one cleans up messes. He swallowed because it seemed the appropriate response and because his throat had gone dry. He took a screenshot with a hand that tried to be steady. He looked around at faces and saw none turned toward him with wickedness painted on. The thing about fear is it convinces you everyone is an actor in your play.\n\nHe walked the long way to the back office where Inez was pretending to answer phones that had not rung yet. She listened to the new message with her head tilted like a bird. She did not swear, because she had a vow about that, but she said, \u201cOh, for the love of thread,\u201d which was her version. She marched him to Darlene, who put on her boss face and then her human face and then picked up the phone with a sigh like a woman making bread. \u201cConstable Lowe,\u201d she said when someone on the other end answered. \u201cDo you have a minute for nothing-too-drastic but not-nothing.\u201d\n\nThey sat in a small room that smelled of toner and listened to a man with kind eyes and end-of-shift energy say the things his father had predicted. He wrote in a notebook that had coffee scars on the cardboard, and he nodded in the rhythm of a man who knows when nodding is part of the medicine. \u201cKeep the messages,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t write back. Tell us if it escalates. Are you going to any events where a mess would truly be exciting. What\u2019s your access to buildings not your own.\u201d Owen told him about keys and about the community center call. Lowe\u2019s eyes did a flicker that meant he\u2019d add a note that said janitor with keys, which in some small percentage of cases turns into a plot point and in most cases turns into a line in a file that gets dusty.\n\n\u201cDo you think this is about the Saturday event, the pancake thing,\u201d Darlene asked, because even people who say they\u2019re not nervous ask about specific mornings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a run of silly,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cSomeone threw a stink bomb under the bleachers at a high school ball game and a kid tripped over an extension cord that wasn\u2019t where it had been a minute before. Someone switched signs outside the petting zoo so the goats ended up in the chickens and the adults found it more upsetting than the animals. We are not exactly in the throes of criminal masterminds. But it\u2019s summer. Mischief wakes up when the lilacs do. If anyone tells you to do a thing or else, come see me before you do it. If they do a thing, call 911 instead of me. People don\u2019t realize they\u2019re allowed to call 911 for things that are not blood, but you are. And\u2014use your eyes. You have eyes.\u201d\n\nHe left the small room with a photocopied page that said How To Report and a feeling like he had done something adult even if that something involved telling someone about texts like a teenager reporting a prank. He sent Mira a message that said, Told a cop. She sent back a gif of a cartoon rolling pin flexing a cartoon bicep.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s breakfast came and went. A man with a voice like a radio station no one listens to spoke for seven minutes about community spirit and fiscal prudence. The muffins were better than the muffins usually are when they are procured by the city. Someone dropped a blueberry on a shoe and someone else tried to be helpful and ground it in with their heel in an act of kindness that left a galaxy where a solar system had been. Owen cleaned it without making it a production and the woman with the blueberry toe said thank you in a way that had a little relief in it, and he filed the thank you away with the ribbon on top of the fridge in the cabinet labeled This Is Why.\n\nAfter lunch he walked to the hardware store and bought a lock that would not stop a determined thief but would slow down an ambitious raccoon. He liked that the packaging promised more than it could deliver with the sincerity of a newscaster. He brought it to Mira and installed it with his gentle tools while she watched and critiqued his screwdriving technique the way a woman watching you knead bread criticizes the way your wrists forget they\u2019re attached to a living thing. She paid him in a loaf of something with seeds like stars. \u201cYou can decline if it offends you,\u201d she said, and he shrugged and put the loaf under his arm like a newspaper.\n\nIn the late afternoon the second text of the day arrived while he was on his couch doing the thing where you sit but do not rest. It said, The next big thing is not muffins. The next big thing is Sunday\u2019s fireworks. Shame, right, if all those families with blankets saw smoke where they didn\u2019t want it. He stared for a count of seven because he had decided seven is how long you pause when deciding whether to panic. He forwarded it to Lowe and to Darlene and to himself, because he wanted a copy that didn\u2019t exist only in the air. He did not write back. He did not call his father immediately because his father would tell him to call someone else first. He called Vernon, because if there was a man in town who wore a blazer to bed in case of event emergencies, it was Vernon.\n\n\u201cFireworks,\u201d he said, and Vernon made a noise like a peacock discovering a snake.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Vernon said. \u201cOh, no. I have had a day. Now I have a week. Thank you. Do not worry. I live to worry for you. That is my function.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe\u2026 lock something,\u201d he said, which was useless advice and both of them knew it.\n\n\u201cFireworks are already in a truck in a place that is not a place because we do not say where the fireworks live,\u201d Vernon said, with unhelpful theatricality. \u201cWe will be on them. Your job is to continue making things invisible. Mine is to shake like a Chihuahua while still appearing smooth. If you see a man with a match, grab him. Metaphorically. Probably. I will call Lowe. I have his number more memorized than my own.\u201d\n\nHe set down the phone and looked at his room like it might answer a question. The ribbon on the fridge caught a slant of light and turned it into a beam that cut across the table where he ate and wrote and sometimes fell asleep on his arms. He walked over and stood very still and then took it down and moved it to the side of the fridge, where it would not be in the sun. He told himself it was because the red would fade. He told himself it was not because he did not want something bright to be a target in a room that suddenly felt like something could throw.\n\nBecause distraction is both enemy and friend, he went for a run. It was more of a shuffle, a cow in a hurry, but it put breath in his lungs in a way that made room in his head. He ran past the pond because he always did, and the ducks argued in their parliament of weeds. A couple sat on a bench with their shoulders touching as if they could give each other posture. He thought of the fireworks and the blanket families and the smell of sulphur that somehow makes memory more sticky. He thought of a person with intent to stir a pot and how that person might have a story that made them think they were the hero. He thought of the way small towns can cradle and suffocate in the same gesture.\n\nAt the end of the loop, he saw a kid hunched over the base of a lamppost with a can in their hand. He slowed because if life is going to deliver you clich\u00e9s you can at least walk up to them with your eyes open. The kid was Brayden, the teenager with the underlined Y, his hair flopped over one eye in an arrangement that did not happen by accident. He started when he saw Owen and then tried to look casual with a technique that would not have fooled a blind librarian.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Owen said. \u201cArt?\u201d\n\n\u201cSticker,\u201d Brayden said, and held up a small circle that said SG YOUTH in a font that wanted to be rebellious when it grew up. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to put them on the skatepark bulletin board. The lamppost was me deciding the lamppost deserved a sticker. I am removing it because a woman with a small dog that looks like a croissant told me to get a job.\u201d\n\n\u201cJobs are overrated when you already have to be a student,\u201d he said. \u201cHey. Weird question. You know anyone who thinks texts are a sport.\u201d\n\nBrayden looked like someone had asked him to parse poetry. \u201cTexts are a sport,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe kind where you send them to strangers and try to make their Tuesday interesting,\u201d Owen said gently.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Brayden said, and genuinely thought about it. \u201cLike that thing where you send your friends a picture of a lawn chair and say, this is your future. My cousin did that until his mom took his phone and then he went outside and it was wild. I don\u2019t know. People are weird. If anybody\u2019s doing that I will flame them on our group chat. Is it about the fireworks. There\u2019s a rumor the fireworks got stolen last year but then they weren\u2019t stolen they were just late because a guy took the wrong exit in Nisku and had a panic attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d he said, which was honest in a way that left space to breathe. \u201cIf anyone brags about pranks more than they should, send them that choosing-to-be-kind meme with the raccoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like that raccoon,\u201d Brayden said, and peeled the sticker with the delicacy of a surgeon. \u201cAdults are so scary about fireworks. It\u2019s like the sky will get mad if we don\u2019t do it right.\u201d\n\nHe went home with the odd feeling that teenagers sometimes hold more of a town\u2019s future than the people who imagine they do. He toasted a slice of seed bread and burned it because he forgot he was making toast and this is a good time to remember that humans are distractible and therefore endearing. He scraped the char into the sink and watched it settle like the end of a snow globe. He answered a text from Inez that said, Update me or I will assume you\u2019re dead, and he told her about Lowe and Vernon and the fireworks and Brayden and the raccoon. She replied with eight goat emojis she had gone out of her way to find.\n\nClose to midnight, his phone lit the dark like a tiny lighthouse. The message said, Good. Tell your new friends with notebooks to keep watch. It would still be a shame if something slipped under the fence. He lay on his back and stared at the ceiling where the lights of cars outside occasionally made a river. He could feel the shape of his keys in his pocket even though they hung on their hook, and he could feel the city\u2019s breath in his bones. He did not answer. He did not sleep easily. It was a waiting kind of night.\n\nBy Wednesday morning the town had gotten wind because towns are lungs and news is oxygen. In the coffee line a man in a camo hat opined about kids these days and a woman in leggings said it was probably adults because kids don\u2019t coordinate that well and the barista said fireworks are dumb unless you\u2019re five or a dog, and Mira when he stopped by told him the plumber had found an excuse to swing by again because the valve needed a talking-to, which is plumber for a bill. She wore her hair in a braid that meant business. There was a small pile of locks on the counter like a display at a hardware-themed bridal shower.\n\n\u201cYou get any sleep,\u201d she asked, and he told her he had gotten the variety where you dream you\u2019re late for a test in a subject no one has heard of. \u201cMe too,\u201d she said. \u201cI dreamed my oven had hands and threw my tray of croissants on the floor and then apologized in French.\u201d\n\n\u201cI talked to a teenager and he was almost reassuring,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich I did not expect. Lowe says tell him if anyone asks you to do anything. No one has asked me. They like to imply. Maybe they think this is noir and they\u2019re mysterious. Meanwhile I\u2019m over here with a bucket trying to prevent municipal calamity.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrevent calamity,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is a noble mission statement. We should put it on a T-shirt. Also, if you do end up in a noir, please don\u2019t wear a fedora. Not everyone looks good in a brim.\u201d\n\nHe left with a cinnamon scone he did not intend to eat and ate half of it before he reached the crosswalk because trying not to eat a cinnamon scone is like trying not to look at a sunset. At the building, the day unrolled. Keys turned. Doors sighed. A woman in a blazer he had never seen carried a binder like a person holding a newborn. The council chamber smelled of wood warmed by air. He cleaned a spill that had no origin story and buffed out a scratch on a plexi sign that told people to be kind as if signs could change tempers. He waited for a text and one did not come, which was worse in the way the body hates a lull when it has learned to expect a sound.\n\nAt four, Lowe called and said he\u2019d like to swing by his place, if that was okay, because sometimes seeing where a person exists helps you understand their map. Owen said yes because saying no felt like the stubbornness of a man who thinks he is not connected to the place he sleeps. Lowe arrived with a smile and a notebook and an ability to stand in a room without making it smaller. He looked at the ribbon on the fridge with the interest of a human who enjoys being in a town where a ribbon on a fridge means something. He asked what Owen did between nine and midnight on any given day and Owen made a joke about toast and told the truth and felt a heat in his face that was not shame but the thing that comes when someone writes down your life in bullet points.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not in trouble,\u201d Lowe said, as if detecting the temperature. \u201cYou\u2019re just in the middle of a thing that might be a thing and might be a nervous person trying out power. There\u2019s a crew covering the fireworks area tonight and the night after. Gates with locks and a guy named Sven who lifts more than is strictly required by society. You don\u2019t have to go be a hero. If you see something odd, call. If your friend with the rolling pin gets a message, tell her to not reply. If someone tries to hand you a bag to leave under a table, throw it in the river. That last one is partly humor. Don\u2019t throw bags in rivers. But don\u2019t carry anything that isn\u2019t yours.\u201d\n\nAfter he left, Owen stood in the kitchen and watched the way light falls on a late summer evening when the sun is tired but proud. He cut the seed bread and buttered it with the reverence you give to something that happened because hands worked. His phone was quiet. The neighbor\u2019s television offered a medical drama where a surgeon made a joke right before saving a life. He dictated a text to his father he didn\u2019t send about how doing nothing feels like a task. He wiped the counter with a rag until it gleamed. He was aware of his own framework, of bones that have had decades to learn how to carry a man in and out of small boats of life. He did not think of pie.\n\nThursday morning the sky was the color of refrigerator light and the wind wore a jacket. He stopped by the fireworks field because he had to see or he would invent. It was cordoned with well-intentioned fences and a sign that said Authorized Personnel Only in type that thought bold meant stern. Two men unloaded boxes that did not reveal their secrets. Lowe stood with a thermos and a posture that said, you can come no closer, and waved at Owen with an economy that made it friendly and not chatty. He waved back and kept moving because he did not need to be another body in a place where bodies were being counted.\n\nHe made it to the office five minutes before his shift because he had read somewhere that being early is good for your teeth. Inez patted his arm with that perfect pressure that says I\u2019m here and then made a goat noise because she could. They moved through the day together the way a good team moves through a kitchen, wordlessly dancing around stools and avoiding each other\u2019s momentum. At noon he got a text that was not the kind they had been receiving but a photo of a raccoon with a piece of bread. Brayden had sent it with the caption, Choose to be kind. He smiled and let it soften something that had started to calcify.\n\nThe weird thing about days with suspense in them is they still want you to buy milk. He went to the grocery store after work and stared at apples in pyramids and had the thought anyone in a panic has at produce, which is how can the world be this specific and banal at once. He bought spinach because it looked like it could fix a soul. He bought a magazine with a crossword because crosswords trick your brain into thinking you\u2019re on a mission. He told the cashier his number and they pretended it gave him points that would one day buy him a toaster.\n\nFriday, the text was silent. Saturday morning, the town set up chairs and blankets with the choreography of tradition. Brick sent him a message that said, Perogy contest volunteers meeting at nine, bring your stomach and your moral compass, and a photo of a pierogi with a face drawn on it that was both adorable and wrong. Mira snapped a picture of a pie with a perfect lattice and no context and sent it with a caption that said, Remind me why I do this to myself, and then followed it with, Because someone eats it and smiles. He walked through the fair like a man walking through a set he had helped build. He bought a lemonade from a child whose seriousness about her cash box made him want to nominate her for mayor. He declined a cinnamon donut because life is choices, even if half of them you only pretend to make.\n\nAt dusk, the field breathed like a sleeping animal. People spread out under the sky. Laughter did that thing where it beads and rolls. In the distance a train said its own name. Owen found a spot near the edge where you can get out if you need to because a man who thinks about egress more now than he did at twenty is a man who has worked in rooms with only one exit and learned to plan. He texted his father, I am sitting on a blanket like a sensible person, and got back a picture of the kettle with the note, Me too.\n\nAs the first flares cracked upward with that tiny cough that precedes the blast, his phone buzzed and his stomach drew itself into a fist because the body does not care if you are trying to enjoy lights. He looked. The message said, It\u2019s pretty when things go as planned. He waited seven seconds and then ten. He watched the shower of white and remembered being small and thinking they must be catching stars and releasing them. He waited, and nothing else came. He felt foolish for how he had braced and then unmanned by how relieved he was. He watched the show with an eye on the fence even as his heart surrendered a little to the theater.\n\nAfter, on the slow flow out of the field, he ran into Lowe, who had a smudge on his cheek that could have been smoke or chocolate. \u201cAll right,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cSometimes that\u2019s what we get. All right.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Owen said, and they stood in the river of people for a beat as if refusing to be carried until they chose to be.\n\nOn the way to his car, he saw Vernon standing alone under a lamppost, blazer slung over his shoulder like a man who would not admit he sweated. He looked up and gave Owen a thumbs up that was more graceful than most thumbs. \u201cWe did not have drama,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had only light. I will sleep for three hours and then I will think of a new thing to fret. Come to the pancake feed tomorrow. Bring your appetite and a small sense of gratitude we can all borrow when ours runs out.\u201d\n\nSunday morning the pancakes were sponges for the syrup of grace. He flipped a few at a volunteer station because someone handed him a spatula and he could not say no to a man with a beard net and a smile that scratched the air. He spilled batter on the griddle and learned on the second try that patience is in fact a tool. He met a woman who had taught him in fourth grade how to multiply by nines with your fingers and he thanked her because it seemed time. He laughed with Brick and did not mention perogies because that felt like tempting the gods, if small towns had gods, which they do, and they\u2019re sometimes goats.\n\nWhen he got home, he found an envelope tucked in the crack between his door and the jam, a trick everyone who has ever left a flyer has learned because mail slots are for landlords. It had no stamp and his name in a hand that was trying very hard to be ordinary. Inside was a photograph printed at a place that still does such a thing. It was the hallway outside the mayor\u2019s office, and in the corner was a mop bucket under a sign that said Wet Floor in a silhouette of a man who had fallen in a sticky triangle. His chest did a small trick. Nothing bad in the picture, just a picture of a place he knew in a time he had been there. On the back, printed with a very fine pen, two words: Nice shine.\n\nHe sat on the edge of his bed with the photograph in his hands and thought, this is a person who wants me to know they can watch. It was petty and theatrical and maybe the kind of thing a person does when they want you to be a character in a story you didn\u2019t ask to be in. He took a photo of the photo and texted it to Lowe with the caption, New fan mail. Then he texted Inez a picture of his own face making a face and she sent back a picture of her knitting a sweater for a goat with the caption, Everyone needs a hobby. He texted Mira a close-up of the word shine and she wrote, Obsessive. Underline. And then, I am making cinnamon rolls tomorrow like a person who believes in mornings.\n\nHe set the photograph on the table and put a coaster on top of it as if the weight mattered to anything and then he laughed at himself because coasters have never stopped a flood or a man. He took a breath. He looked at his keys hanging on their hook. He thought of doors being his profession and his life. He told himself the truth that living is ninety percent squeegeeing small puddles and ten percent dealing with a wave. He got up and did the dishes because your hands get busy when your head can\u2019t decide. He hummed a new tune that might have been an old hymn and thought, okay. If this is a story, I\u2019ll do it the way I do floors. One square at a time. And if it isn\u2019t, I\u2019ll still keep my rags clean.",

The mornings stopped pretending to be cool even when they were blue, and the afternoon wind smelled like someone had left a bread oven door open somewhere on the prairie. The building took it in and let it out the way old buildings do, sighing around expansions and contractions, settling into the season with a creak. Owen\u2019s mop water looked like melted coins in the bucket before the soap turned it into a lake where citrus clouds drifted. He dragged the mop in straight, stubborn lines and thought about how light sits differently on a floor in July. It\u2019s less forgiving, more direct. It tells the truth about places you missed.\n\nBy nine the first text arrived like a mosquito no one had invited. Leave the south door to the annex on the latch tonight, it said. No one will know. You\u2019ll sleep, town sleeps, everyone wins. He read it twice and the skin between his shoulder blades tightened the way it does when a breeze comes from a door you didn\u2019t know was open. The annex door was the one Inez calls The Door of Destiny because it sticks in winter and flirts in summer, a door that could make a sermon out of any day. He put the phone in his pocket and it burned there like a small stove.\n\nHe could have kept it to himself for an hour, maybe two, to see if his brain would build a case for pretending, but he had promised too many people not to be ridiculous. He walked it straight to Darlene, who was eating a yogurt with the resignation of a woman who had wanted a donut and the discipline of a woman who knew what donuts do at two in the afternoon. She didn\u2019t say are you sure even though some bosses would have in a voice that puts the burden back in your hands. She said, \u201cWe call Lowe,\u201d and sniffed the yogurt like it might apologize.\n\nIn Lowe\u2019s small office the fan clicked as it rotated, the kind of click you stop noticing if your nerves are not tuned for it. Lowe listened and the corners of his eyes did their little squint that could be humor or could be the way a man reads a map he\u2019s seen before. \u201cWe set the table, then,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t put the dish where they ask us to put it. We set the table where the dish belongs, and we leave out something unappetizing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean,\u201d Darlene asked, practical down to the fibres of her blazer. \u201cBecause I am not setting my table with a stink bomb.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means I put my person where they expect you not to,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means if the request is about the south door, we make the south door sing like a choir when it opens and we leave the west door alone like a sleeping cat, and anyone who knows their way around will go where they think we\u2019re dumb enough to give. It also means I would like your permission to tuck a camera in your fern. No, not the sad one. The one with ambition.\u201d\n\nDarlene\u2019s mouth went sideways. She loved her ferns the way some people love particular pens. \u201cThe fern will testify if it must,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if anyone waters it while you\u2019re in there, tell them to stop. It was emotionally overwatered as a child.\u201d She turned to Owen, and whatever bossness she kept around for days when people argued about time sheets drained out and left something older. \u201cYou don\u2019t touch that door. Not by accident. If you were the type to be tempted, which you aren\u2019t, this would be the day to consider how long it takes to rebuild trust. It is not a mop head. It is slow.\u201d\n\nHe thought of keys, of the way they whisper when they thread through their ring, of the weight of them against his hip when he walks. He thought of being trusted with entries and exits and how it had quietly become an identity in a way that had nothing to do with exceptionalism and everything to do with showing up. \u201cI hear you,\u201d he said. He heard himself, too, and the part of him that wants to compromise to make a nuisance go away sat in a chair and did not get a say.\n\nAt lunch he took his sandwich to the back steps and watched a grasshopper lose a fight with a gust of wind and then win the second round like an athlete who\u2019d read all the wrong stats. He called his father because you don\u2019t always wait until Sunday for the normal voice. His father let him tell it and did not interrupt except to ask which door, because specifics calm him. \u201cDo you know why that door,\u201d he asked, and Owen said he didn\u2019t and that he could make ten arguments for it being any door because people like to pretend they\u2019re thinking of a door when what they want is to see if you\u2019ll do what you\u2019re told.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s someone testing the edges of you,\u201d his father said. \u201cPeople do that when they can\u2019t manage their own. Don\u2019t be angry in a way that makes you sloppy. I am proud and somewhat worried in equal measures, which I suspect is my permanent condition until they put me in the ground and I start worrying about the worms.\u201d He chuckled and made tea too strong and said, \u201cLock your locking, son,\u201d and Owen found the laugh loosening something.\n\nThe bakery was a soft ferocity when he stopped by. The lights looked as if they had read a poem and wanted to be kinder. Mira had a smear of cocoa across one cheek that made her look like she\u2019d survived a battle and won. On the counter lay an array of small locks in packaging, a nest of keys like a school of fish, and a lemon tart that had not yet been asked to be perfect.\n\n\u201cYou look like a man who is thinking about hinges,\u201d she said, sliding a plate toward him because she has learned that if you hand him food his mouth will eventually say the thing he came to say. He told her about the text, about Lowe\u2019s plan, about the fern with eyes, and she made the face she makes when she has both an opinion and the wisdom to deliver it gently. \u201cNobody asks you to make your own life smaller unless they already made theirs too small to live in,\u201d she said. \u201cYou do not become less just because someone says please. See how I did not swear. Are we proud of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, and meant it. \u201cDo you know what I thought of when I read it. My eight-year-old self standing on a chair and my dad saying don\u2019t touch the stove, and me touching the stove because touching is the way to learn. This is not a stove I need to touch in order to know it\u2019s hot.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at you growing your prefrontal cortex,\u201d she said, and took the cocoa streak off her face with the back of her hand just to smear it on the other side. \u201cI got another thing this morning. From a different number, I think. It said, never mind about staying open late, what if you just stop making those ugly braided loaves. And they spelled braided like a person who had been betrayed by braids. I had to sit on my hands so I didn\u2019t write back and tell them my loaves are prettier than their soul. I blocked it and then I iced a batch of cupcakes so exacting I scared myself.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t like that the messages had multiplied like rabbits on spring grass. He didn\u2019t like that their edges fuzzed out into the whole town the way gossip is a fog and not a line. He told her he\u2019d be in touch after the door plan, and she told him she would be at home with a rolling pin and a movie and a willingness to throw her phone in the freezer if need be. He wished he could guarantee her a quiet night the way you wish you could guarantee someone will love you back. You can promise your actions. The rest remains a community project.\n\nThey rigged the annex like a house at Halloween, except less fun and with more paperwork. Lowe\u2019s person turned out to be a woman in a jacket that did not mind the heat, hair tucked up neat, manner like a Sunday school teacher with a black belt. She gave the kicked fern a rueful pat and tucked her camera low and sat among filing cabinets as if she\u2019d been there forever. Owen made his passes like a man walking pixie dust into a plan, checking that the jalousie window on the west side caught fine dust when he snapped it, wiping down the glass with a blue rag that left nothing but the scent he associated with working and sleep. He felt watched and did not like that he liked it less when the watching was on his side. He told himself it was good. He told himself once and it was enough.\n\nThe night edged in with its summer soundtrack of skittering bicycles and someone two blocks over trying the guitar with more enthusiasm than technique. He finished his shift a shade later than he wanted and allowed himself the laziness of leaving a chair not exactly where he had found it because he planned to put it there in the morning anyway. He stood at the south annex door long enough to feel like a clich\u00e9, then walked away. He locked the west door and double-checked it, so he would not build a movie in his head about what he had done wrong. He said goodnight to the building just loud enough to make himself smile.\n\nIf the person who sent the text had been a character in a book he would have arrived with a cat under his arm and a hat too serious for his head. Instead, he came in on sneaker soles, quiet not because he was practiced but because night makes us all lighter. Lowe\u2019s person watched him on a screen the size of a paperback and wrote something down she would copy into a report later. He passed by the south door and put his hand on it in that way people touch surfaces to make sure the laws of physics still apply. He tried the handle and frowned when it didn\u2019t give. He moved toward the west door with a little huff in his chest that was either indignation or exertion. He had a bag that did not sag enough to hold anything dramatic. He had a posture that said apology rehearsed and readiness scratched. He went for the west door as if he had not been told what to do about a door but knew a lot about what the building does anyway.\n\nThey let him open it and then stepped into the space the way people who train to do this move without drama, just correctness. \u201cEvening,\u201d Lowe\u2019s person said, as if she were interrupting a man checking church pews for left-behind Bibles. \u201cYou have a key for that.\u201d\n\nThe man\u2019s face did an alphabet. Surprise, indignation, reasoning, charm. He went with charm and then abandoned it three words in for irritation because charm is a suit you have to fit for, and it had not been tailored for him. \u201cI work here,\u201d he said, which is a sentence as unhelpful as I belong here. \u201cI had to grab something I left.\u201d\n\nShe asked to see his badge and the way he reached for his belt told her everything. He did not wear a badge. He wore a clip where a badge might be if he were the sort of man to clip one there. His hand hovered as if he could conjure a rectangle with a photo on it through wishes and the friction of his fingers. She asked his name then, and when he said Joel, something that had been resting in Owen\u2019s head like a small bird with a broken foot lifted and turned over.\n\nJoel. The coworker with the tendency to treat all jobs as equal because all jobs needed a body moving in them and he had a body. Joel of the sloppy edges, the ghost shifts, the airing of grievances so passively you needed a translator. Joel who sometimes left a mop head sitting in the bucket as if mop heads like being baptized for hours. Joel whom Darlene sent when she had no one else to send and apologized to the building under her breath because she\u2019d be the one to fix the corners later. Joel with a jaw that clenched when Darlene picked someone else for the church contract and who had once suggested in a voice he thought was quiet that if the council changed over next fall, contracts might change, too.\n\nThey walked him into the light like a man being introduced to the stage for the first time and sat him at a table as if this were an interview. Lowe appeared out of the corridor with that gentle faux-surprise he uses on people who need to be told what is already obvious. He offered Joel water and asked whether he likes events, whether he likes fireworks, whether he likes attention. Joel answered like a man walking down a hall where doors keep opening and behind each door is a person who wants him to say yes. He said he was trying to prove a point. He said if people saw how thin the staffing is they would stop calling Darlene at home at eleven about a paper towel dispenser that wouldn\u2019t behave and start feeling grateful. He said he had been embarrassed for months by the low-grade messes he couldn\u2019t clean when he wasn\u2019t on the schedule, that pride is weird in a janitor, that nobody sees you until you fail.\n\nIt was a story that could sit in a room without being pitched, and it could also be a way to not say something else. He had a can of stink in the bag, old-school and destructive to nostrils, but not the kind of thing that would make the six o\u2019clock news. He had a towel in there that didn\u2019t belong to any building they knew. He had a key that had once opened a closet in the community center before Darlene re-cored it, which is its own story if you know how buildings hold on to their teeth. His phone had numbers in it that Lowe would not scroll in front of them, because there are laws and also because decency is not a law and still matters.\n\nOwen was allowed to be part of the room the way the person who finds the first footprint on a flour-dusted floor gets to stand a little closer to the crime. He watched Joel fold into himself, not dramatically, not like a man being booked in a movie, but like a person who had come at night with a plan to feel bigger and instead realized he was small in the precise way we all are when the lights are this bright. He felt anger fizz and settle. This wasn\u2019t sexy. This was a man with a bag and a small story who had sent texts like a boy playing spy. This was also a man who knew his way around wet floor signs and valves and the habit of hiding digital footsteps. You can fit more than one truth in a room, especially when it smells like lemon polish and rethinking.\n\nThe parts that followed were dull in the way justice should be dull. Statements written in narrow boxes. A call to a boss. A decision not to put handcuffs on a man who had mostly threatened theater. The bag labeled. The fern turned back toward the window, because even in municipal dramas we do not leave plants facing walls. Lowe\u2019s promise that unspectacular charges are still charges and that people change their behavior for two reasons: they get held, or they find a story they like better. Joel looked like neither option had been available to him for a long time and like maybe, with this not-ordeal in progress, a door had cracked that wasn\u2019t the annex.\n\nAfter, when the building was a body exhaling and Inez relocated her concern into action by reorganizing the drawer where the batteries live, Owen found himself sitting on the back steps again, heat still popping off the asphalt like a body trying to shake water out of its ears. He expected relief like you expect a glass of water to be cold and was surprised when his throat wanted something warmer. He phoned his father and told him the version that didn\u2019t include all the private names, and his father said the sentence he says when a human makes a human mess. \u201cI don\u2019t excuse his bit,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I recognize the recipe. Maybe we can get him a different cookbook.\u201d\n\nBrick texted the way a man texts when he suspects he is not the kind of friend who gets called first but wants to be the kind who shows up second. Did you get your raccoon, he wrote, and then, Sorry, that\u2019s my metaphor when people try to get in your bins. He followed it with, Perogy practice Wednesday; someone\u2019s baba is going to yell at me about my technique and I will cry. Bring your tastebuds and a towel. Owen wrote back that he\u2019d come, because practice in any form was comfort, and because babas yelling love you in a sharp language under the edges.\n\nMira was leaning in her doorway when he came by with no intention except to stand in a place that knows how to smell like welcome. She listened to the story, and her eyes did that soft crinkle at the corners that makes you understand why people tell her things that cost them. \u201cI despise that,\u201d she said. \u201cI despise someone making you think you\u2019re a piece in their game. And at the same time, I could cry for him, messy mop and all.\u201d She shook her head like a dog getting rid of water it did not ask for. \u201cWe have a rule in here. When we fight with our dough\u2014because we all fight with our dough\u2014we have to say nice things to it for a full minute before we throw up our hands and give up. It works on people, too, sometimes. Not always. You can\u2019t make bread rise with compliments alone. But it\u2019s a start.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat nice thing do we say to a man who tries to convince you to leave a door unlocked,\u201d he asked, feeling the joke roll through his chest like a ball he could carry without tripping.\n\n\u201cWe say, you are more interesting than the worst thing you did this summer,\u201d she said, and then made a face. \u201cAnd then we say, pay your fine and get a different job if you can, because you\u2019re not allowed back in my back room with that attitude.\u201d\n\nThey ate a slice of the lemon tart with the concentration of scientists. He told her about how the camera was hidden in the fern, and she laughed until she hiccuped. She told him about the kid who\u2019d come in with his grandma to buy one cupcake and stood on his toes to see and told her, whisper-serious, that the strawberry looked the most like a planet. He thought about how maybe if more people were asked to choose planets from cupcakes, fewer stink devices would ever get purchased from a sketchy online store with free shipping.\n\nYou would think a town exhales and goes back to ring toss and therapy after a week like that, but life does not stack itself neatly. Vernon found a way to have an emergency about table rentals and a person in the mayor\u2019s orbit called twice asking whether the fern was traumatized and whether there was a way to put security on the rest of the plants because you know how these things go, one fern gets the bug and the next thing you know a ficus runs away. The local online mom group produced three lengthy posts about whether leaving a door unlocked counted as endangering children and two about whether fireworks at all are insensitive to dogs, which, Owen had to admit, they might be. Lowe came by to thank him with a box of timbits like a man who knows how to speak Canadian, and Inez knitted a little thing that turned out to be a koozie for the spray bottle they share, which she announced with pride as if she had invented mittens.\n\nThe perogy practice at the community hall was a clatter of bowls and vowels. A line of women and two men who had been drafted rolled and pinched with the assertive tenderness of people who know food is language. Brick arrived with flour on his shirt as if he had got into a fight with a bag and apologized to it. He made a mess of his first dozen and apologized to a grandmother named Svitlana who swatted his knuckles with a spoon and then kissed his cheek hard enough to knock gratitude into his skull. Owen found he was passable at the pinch if he imagined it was a tiny wet floor sign he had to fold, a caution into a comfort. They ate their ugly ones with fried onions and sour cream and a communal silence that attends the right foods.\n\nCannon showed up late with a new T-shirt advertising Chomp Squad, LLC, and a grin that made children like him despite themselves. He clapped Brick on the back, gave Owen a nod that had nothing smarmy in it for once, and told a vivid story about a festival in Red Deer where a man tried to sneak a second stomach under his shirt and almost got away with it. Someone told him the perogy event was charity and not a competition, and he said every potluck is a competition to the right auntie. He was not wrong. Owen left with a container of dumplings that steamed his windshield and a sense that eyes on him were friend-eyes again, not phone numbers hiding behind a curtain.\n\nAt work, the day after Lowe spoke to Joel\u2019s union rep and a letter had been composed and a bench had become useful for a while, the pink notes on the board returned to their ordinary job. Inez drew a goat in sunglasses. Someone wrote a reminder to make two extra pots of coffee on Thursday for the building inspectors who become miserable when caffeine is a theory. The annex door got a new plate on its latch that made it make a different sound when it closed, a more confident clack. The fern looked toward the window like nothing had ever happened, a professionalism Owen envied a little. He swept and mopped and buffed, and he hummed, because if he stopped that, then the texts had taken something they were not allowed to take.\n\nOccasionally the memory of the photo in his door\u2014Nice shine\u2014would surface like a fish in a pond, breaking his surface with a ripple. He left it under the coaster where it belonged, not to be honored, but not denied. There is a difference. He told himself the thing he knew was true: that his work puts him in the path of everything people leave. Some of those leavings are spills. Some are notes. Some are, regrettably, human. That is not a reason to stop, any more than a drip is a reason to abandon a sink. You shut the valve. You grab the towel. You teach the floor how to be dry again and the air how to smell like what you can count on.\n\nThe week put itself to bed, and the next week tried on fresh nonsense like a hat. A woman from Facilities called to ask if he could sanitize the conference room chairs extra hard because a consultant from Calgary had sat in one and declared he\u2019d gotten a rash that smelled like lemon oil. Inez printed a sign for the copier that said, Speak Kindly To Me, I Am Sentient And So Are You, which made three people laugh and one man write a serious email about professionalism. Mira brought him a small pie, savory, with potato and dill and a pastry so short it tried to escape itself, and he took it home and ate it over the sink the way bachelors do when the fork is too far away.\n\nOn Friday he and his father sat on the front step with mugs so hot you had to commit to them and the sky doing that July thing where it pretends to be August. His father told him about a new neighbor with a dandelion army and a hand more suited to painting than to weeds, and Owen told him about learning to pinch dough from a woman whose hands were smooth and strong like rolling pins passed down through too many dinners to count. They did not talk about Joel because there is a limit to how many times you can tell the story of a man who tried to be large and made himself small instead, and because the story had been discussed enough to not be the freshest air. His father touched the mug to his lip and did the small hiss he always does and said, \u201cYou look steadier,\u201d and Owen thought, it isn\u2019t the absence of nonsense. It\u2019s that he\u2019d been reminded nonsense isn\u2019t the only weight.\n\nLate in the evening, as the heat finally admitted it was tired, his phone buzzed with a number he recognized now, not as the anonymous pest, but as an unfamiliar friend. Lowe. You should know, it said, in the bland diction of men who have to put things on paper later, the statements are done. We\u2019ll supervise a restorative thing if both agree. If not, there will be a small court day no one enjoys. He added, on a second line that felt like an afterthought with sincerity peeking through, Your fern was brave. Owen laughed into his empty apartment and wrote back, Thank the fern for me, and then, Thank you. He set the phone face down not in defiance but in the practice of being a person without constant light.\n\nOn Sunday, Brick dragged him to the river valley market in Edmonton, all honks and buskers and gluten-free hope. They walked among the stalls like tourists in their own province. A woman sold honey out of jars like jewelry. A man carved names into belt leather with a flourish. They watched a toddler negotiate with a dog the size of a small horse and concluded the toddler had the upper hand. Brick bought a skillet he didn\u2019t need, which is the only way to buy a skillet, and Owen bought a second-hand novel because someone had written in the margins with a neat hand that disagreed with the author in the kindest possible way. Cannon sent a photo from a different market where he was promoting his brand in a shirt his girlfriend had bedazzled and no one felt threatened by his enthusiasm, which is how enthusiasm should be tolerated in decent places.\n\nOn the drive back, the road did its ribbon thing and the fields lay like content animals and Brick cleared his throat in that particular way large men do when they are about to step into a small feeling. \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone name you with their bad day,\u201d he said, watching a hawk ride a wind he couldn\u2019t see. \u201cMy granddad told me that. He said he\u2019d spent forty years having men try to relieve themselves of their weather by putting it on his back. The best days he just let it go down his coat and onto the ground. The worst days he carried it home and apologised to the table.\u201d He chuckled and shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to apologize to my table. It holds my food. It deserves better.\u201d\n\nWhen he told Inez about the fern note and Lowe\u2019s text and Brick\u2019s granddad\u2019s advice, she listened with her knitting in her lap and miscounted stitches on purpose to show she was paying attention to him. \u201cAll right then,\u201d she said when he finished. \u201cHere is our plan. You will continue to make the world less sticky. I will continue to knit ridiculous items for inanimate objects as my way of rebelling against chaos. We will attend the perogy charity with our faces saying gratitude and our stomachs pretending we\u2019re polite. And when the next person thinks they can write your lines with their thumbs, we will say, no thank you, I have a script.\u201d She held up the goat sweater, which had achieved an armhole by accident. \u201cAlso, what size is a goat\u2019s neck. Tell me you know. You know everything else about this town.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t, and that was a relief. The final night of the month he stood in the quiet lobby after a double-shift that had been less about cleaning and more about moving chairs for a budget meeting that could have been an email, and he let the air settle around him. The glass gave him back a face he recognized, a little older, a little more assured that the way through a story is foot by foot. He turned off the last light with a flick he had perfected and listened as the hum fell to something like sleep. In the dark, his keys whispered. He whispered back, because sometimes that is how you learn where you are in your own plot. Then he walked out into heat that had learned moderation and the smell of mown grass and the distant rumor of fireworks that live in other people\u2019s towns, happy for them the way you can be happy for a neighbor\u2019s luck. He locked the door, checked it without making it about superstition, and headed toward the shape of home with the day under his arm like a folded towel, wrung and clean.",

The mornings came in thin at first and then laid on a thicker hand, the light less golden now, more brass, precise and unforgiving on scuffed baseboards and the seam where the vinyl met the tile in the second-floor corridor. The building made the sounds of a creature adjusting to a room with one more person than it expected: an extra tick from the exit sign, a new whistle from the air conditioning that had developed an opinion. Owen rolled his bucket slow, listened for what wanted tending, and let his hands find their answers the way they always did, by touching what his eyes had already decided to love back to service.\n\nLowe\u2019s email came on a Monday that had the nerves of a first day of school even though everyone had been sitting at these desks for years. It was brief in the way bureaucratic kindness can be, the necessary nouns and verbs arranged in a steady line. There would be a restorative meeting for those affected by Joel\u2019s choices, if those affected wished to attend. Volunteers would be present from a community organization whose logo was a circle around a tree. There would be tea. Joel had agreed to come. \u201cNo surprises,\u201d the email said, as if preemptively apologizing for the world\u2019s habit of offering exactly that. When he read it a second time in the break room with the smell of burnt coffee attempting to pass itself off as toast, he could feel the nervous animal in his chest put its paws down and tilt its head, listening for the tone beneath the words.\n\nThey met in the church basement that knows the town\u2019s secrets the way a rug knows where people stand when they speak truth. Metal chairs made their spatial music as they shuffled into a circle. In the center sat a basket of objects that looked like the junk drawer at the end of a hard winter: a smooth stone, a knitted square, a laminated photograph of a soccer team from years before Owen moved back, a pen that had stopped writing but refused to be thrown away. The facilitator was a woman with greying curls who wore her reading glasses on a chain like a tiny necklace of authority. She placed a hand on the basket like she was making a benediction and said her name\u2014Rowan\u2014and set the rules on the ground like tools: we speak to be heard, we listen to understand, we pass if we are not ready, the tea is there if your hands need something.\n\nDarlene sat with her shoulders square, a clipboard in her lap because even in the soft rooms she kept one in reach. Inez had come without fuss and brought in a plate of muffins that resembled the planets as drawn by a child in a hurry. Vernon arrived late and tried to fold his height into a chair made for smaller men, his blazer asking for applause even when the man did not. Owen took the chair he could see the door from with ease, not because he did not trust the room, but because he had learned to give himself this small gift without having to justify it to anyone who wasn\u2019t him. Joel sat opposite him, as if someone had drawn a line across the circle and put them on either end to balance the weight.\n\nUp close, Joel looked like a man who had been taken out of his script too early. He had the twitchiness of someone who had told himself three monologues and was trying to decide which one fit in his mouth without making him choke. When the talking piece\u2014a sanded-down bit of wood that felt like a handle to nowhere\u2014came to him, he didn\u2019t grab it so much as let it land in his palm and stay, and his first breath was that sound people make when they finally admit they have been holding one too long.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I wanted it to matter that we were needed,\u201d he said, and the words had the stubborn plainness of two-by-fours. \u201cI wanted someone to realize that the reason there aren\u2019t messes is because someone\u2019s there to catch them. I kept thinking if a thing stank enough people would\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Look up? Notice. Call for more bodies so we weren\u2019t just a name on a list you call when your coffee hates you. I told myself I\u2019d do\u2026 worse if I had to. I didn\u2019t. Doesn\u2019t make the not-worse okay.\u201d He looked at his hands like they had answers. \u201cI sent some of the messages. The ones about the door. The one to you about shine.\u201d His eyes flicked to Owen, met, retreated. \u201cNot the bakery ones. That wasn\u2019t me. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s got that in them.\u201d\n\nOwen let the words come into him, then lay them side by side the way you do with screws and nails so you know what width of hole needs filling. It was a relief and not, to have half the fog burn off and still see a shape standing behind it. He could see the story\u2019s appeal from Joel\u2019s side: the small joy of finally triggering a reaction in a world that begs for invisible hands. He could also see the hollowness left behind when the stage lights you begged for finally breach the dark and you aren\u2019t ready for what your face looks like.\n\nWhen the wood piece came to him, it felt like the handle of a small cupboard door, the kind you open when you want a glass to fill and a place to put it down again after. He hadn\u2019t planned words because planning had never made words better for him, but they came with the same steadiness as a floor wash done properly. \u201cKeys make noise,\u201d he said, and heard Inez\u2019s breath turn into a soft laugh because she knows the sound. \u201cThey whisper and they clink and they say you belong here in the useful way, not the permanent way, and I like that. I like that someone decided I could carry access and not abuse it. I like that you can count on a lock pressed shut as much as you can count on me to open it when it\u2019s time. Your messages tried to turn that into a test, and I hate tests I didn\u2019t sign up for. But I hear the\u2026 want in what you did. I hear the wanting to be seen. I get that want. My mother could make a table sing with a cloth and you\u2019d never know her name if you ate on it twice a week for twenty years.\u201d He looked across at Joel and didn\u2019t make his mouth into anything it wasn\u2019t. \u201cIf the job\u2019s breaking you, change the job you do at the job. Or leave. Don\u2019t break the building to see if anyone loves it. We\u2019ll all clean it, they\u2019ll clap, and you\u2019ll still go home feeling like the wall no one noticed.\u201d\n\nRowan made the kind of sound a kettle makes when it boils for the second time, soft and proud. Darlene, who had been letting her clipboard absorb her glare, put it down and let her hands be hands. \u201cWe can carve you something that doesn\u2019t make you feel like a mop on legs,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s on me as much as it\u2019s on you. Training. Mentoring. You\u2019re right that people see a spill before they see who sealed the floor last week so the spill didn\u2019t stain. We can note the sealing. We can put names on the work. And you\u2019re off after nine for a while. Not as a punishment. As a kindness to me so I don\u2019t have to sit at my kitchen table wondering what door you\u2019re thinking about.\u201d\n\nVernon cleared his throat to insert himself into the scene like a side character who knows his cue. \u201cIf we are doing accountability, let me say on the record that the cones being moved was not the wind, as I publicly speculated to save face. It was children who wanted to make a maze. The children apologized via macaroni cards that still smell like glue. I will be retaining the cards as a reminder that sometimes the universe chooses to surprise you with joy instead of disgust. Joel, I\u2019m not your boss, but I use your work like a clown uses a mirror. I want you to find a better show.\u201d\n\nThey made agreements the way people decide on potluck dishes: practical, a little optimistic, with contingency plans. Joel would spend six weekends supervised at the skatepark with Brayden and the youth group rolling paint over sun-faded tags. He would write apologies to the people who got the worst of the texts, including Owen and Darlene and \u201cthe fern\u201d because Rowan was a woman who believed in naming the whole truth. The union would send a trainer with the patience of a grandparent to teach him the tricks of machines he\u2019d been using like they were enemies. He would not go near the bakery with any attitude that was not pastry-positive for the foreseeable future. If he stuck the plan, there would be no courtroom. If he couldn\u2019t, there would be papers, and anyone who had ever sat in a court knows papers do not care about your best intentions.\n\nAfter, at the table with the tea that had steeped too long and was now medicinal, Inez patted his elbow in a way that also re-anchored him. \u201cYou did good, hanger,\u201d she said, and then added in a voice meant to carry, \u201cAnd in honor of all restorative practices, you may have the last muffin even though it was technically promised to my imaginary goat.\u201d He took it because refusing her gifts felt like throwing a blanket on a cat that had chosen you.\n\nThe bakery took its inspection like a stoic who knows where the bruises will be. The inspector was a narrow man with a generous smile and a thermometer he treated like a friend he trusts to remind him of the truth when he flirts with lies. He introduced himself as Sanjay and complimented the chalkboard menu with an honesty that made the compliment stand taller than the chalk\u2019s wavering lines. He did the system with Mira that people use when they have to check a kitchen that is both a livelihood and a personality: open, glance, test, close, note; repeat; crack a joke about how ovens become divas in their middle age; praise the clean corners, frown kindly at the drain cover that had rusted into modern art.\n\nWhen the thermometer beeped over the trays cooling on the rack, he nodded in the way a man nods when mechanics purr. When the thermometer beeped under and he did his little sigh, Mira\u2019s posture faltered for just a heartbeat. Owen, who had come by with a box of new floor mats bought with his hardware-store discount and an enthusiasm he dressed up as practicality, stood by the sink and used his hands to find the new tune of the valve he had learned months ago. Sanjay asked about labels and Mira produced a label maker that had opinions and began spitting out labels with the gusto of a talkative aunt. Inez arrived mid-ordeal with a roll of paper towels and a temper that frightened bureaucrats into common sense and charmed them into extending deadlines they did not need to extend.\n\nBy the end, there was a list that looked longer than it felt, because some items on lists wear tall hats to look important. Mira had a new timeline for the mats\u2014as if they hadn\u2019t fallen like gifts into her lap\u2014an instruction about keeping a log the way teenagers keep diaries, a promise to replace two cracked containers she\u2019d been meaning to kiss goodbye and hadn\u2019t because morning comes at you like a train. Sanjay signed with a flourish that said he had the heart of a man who secretly acts in community theater and told her what he tells all the bakers he likes: put your thermometer where you see it. Put your signs where people will read them while pretending they won\u2019t. Put your faith in your habits, not in last-minute miracles. She nodded and bit her lip and after he left she leaned against the fridge and let out the long exhale she\u2019d been saving since eighteen.\n\n\u201cYou handled him,\u201d Owen said. \u201cLike he was a cake you were not going to let fall.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was kinder than the last one,\u201d she said. \u201cShe had a soul like a sharpened spoon. He has\u2026 sun under there. Thank you for the mats. Don\u2019t tell me how much they cost or I will both refuse and probably scold you, and neither of those things fits me today.\u201d She fiddled with the label maker and accidentally printed the word cinnamon six times in a row and handed him the strip like a fortune. \u201cYou going to the perogy thing, or are you avoiding babas who will insist on pinching your cheeks and your dumplings.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will be where the onions are,\u201d he said, and felt his stomach get ahead of his mouth, making plans it wanted his brain to honor.\n\nThe community hall smelled like childhood and church basement and the promise of a meal you didn\u2019t have to cook. The stage had a polka band that was two-thirds accordion and one-third grin, and someone\u2019s nephew on a borrowed drum kit who discovered the joy of brushes and chose restraint for the first time in his life. Long tables blazed with plates and the complicated choreography of communal eating, people at different ends playing passive-aggressive tug-of-war with the sour cream. The library\u2019s donation jar sat next to a stack of flyers that had been folded and refolded into airplanes by children who protested the cost of literacy until they were handed a book they wanted to devour and forgot their complaint in the first paragraph.\n\nBrick wore an apron that had been white once in Alberta history and now bore the record of onions and kindness in topography. He handed out plates with a solemnity that made parents trust him to give their children the right ratio of food to food-mood. Cannon had been drafted into emcee duty by a woman with a voice like a scythe and a soft spot for confident young men, and he did the job with a self-mockery that saved him from being a caricature. He introduced the baba brigade like a sports team, complete with nicknames\u2014\u201cThe Crimper,\u201d \u201cThe Speed,\u201d \u201cThe Architect\u201d\u2014and when he called for a round of applause for Svitlana, who had donated thirty dozen of her magic from a kitchen where the countertops sit slightly lower than modern fashions, the roar would have made a smaller town think there was a fire. Owen took a turn at the sink because he knows how to respect a system; he washed until the water ran less onion and more hope, and every time he turned the tap the hose gave him a friendly slap like the hand of a coach telling him he\u2019d make the team if he kept his knees bent.\n\nHe did not compete but he stood at a station where someone had piled the \u201cugly ones\u201d and made it his job to move them discreetly onto plates so no one would feel like they were eating from the reject pile. If the trick to being a person at a charity feed is to carry your own appetite without making it the only guest, he did well. He watched Brick\u2019s face halfway between ecstasy and humility when Svitlana corrected his technique with a laugh that chose to forgive the whole of manhood in one noise. He laughed until his ribs made little protests when Cannon tried to demonstrate a perogy flip in the air and succeeded only in decorating his shirt with a scar of potato that looked like Saskatchewan. He put ten dollars in the jar because eleven felt showy and nine felt stingy, and he told the librarian that replacing the children\u2019s reading rug with something less reminiscent of the eighties would make a lot of knees thankful. When a boy in a hockey jersey stood up in line and announced with righteous despair that he had gotten a cabbage roll in his perogy section, Owen traded him plates without making the boy feel like he\u2019d been rescued from a war. Sometimes heroism is the swap no one else wants to do.\n\nAfter, he walked out under a sky that had left a little lavender for anyone who looked up and found Mira sitting on the concrete stoop, papers fanned out next to her like a flock of exhausted pigeons. She had flour in the laces of her sneakers, which made him absurdly happy, as if he\u2019d caught her in the middle of a sentence that proved a theory he\u2019d been entertaining about her hands. She made a space with her hip without comment, and he sat, and the concrete read their temperatures and decided to even them out.\n\n\u201cI got complimented by an inspector today,\u201d she said, still stunned. \u201cI was going to write it in a journal if I kept a journal. I will instead etch it on the back of my hand like a high school cheater and consult it when I feel that feeling that whispers I am ridiculous and the world will find out.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are ridiculous,\u201d he said, and when she slugged his shoulder with a knuckle the size of a blueberry he caught her grin in the corner of his eye. \u201cIn the way that people doing beautiful things have to be. What are you reading.\u201d\n\nShe showed him the papers facing down\u2014an application for a small business grant that had the earnest smell of government money\u2014and a sketch of the bakery\u2019s back room with boxes arranged in ways that suggested she was courting change. \u201cI want a second oven,\u201d she said, and then looked like she wanted to apologize for ambition. \u201cI want to do more of the things that bring me actual joy and fewer of the things that pay the rent but also flatten me into a person who solves the same puzzle three hundred times a month. I want to hire a kid and pay them decently to learn how to make pastry without tears so that later in life, when everything is noise, they can make a pie and shut the world up for an hour. Is that so wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the opposite of wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is so right I feel I should stand and recite a pledge. You going to ask Vernon for letterhead or will that give the grant committee hives.\u201d\n\nShe groaned and let her head fall back. \u201cI will ask Lowe to write about crime prevention through pastry. He will use the phrase \u2018pro-social glazing\u2019 and the committee will be forced to put me on a poster.\u201d\n\nHis father called the next morning and said, in a voice that had the lilt of a boy planning to run away with a friend, \u201cAre you available to leave responsibility for four hours and go to Wabamun with a cooler and an insufficient amount of bait.\u201d It is difficult to refuse a man who can make failure sound like an adventure, so Owen packed sandwiches that would travel, found sunscreen he did not trust, and met him at the gas station where men stand very close to their trucks and contemplate the price of fuel like it might perform contrition if glared at long enough.\n\nThey drove with the windows down because air conditioning had decided to be temperamental in the way machines do when they wish to be praised for what they still offer. The lake tilted into view like a coin someone\u2019s grandfather pulls from behind your ear, obvious and still magic. They rented a rowboat because the outboard had been loved too hard by teenagers the weekend before, and the young man at the counter had that beaten-but-brave look of an employee who says yes whenever the world tells him to say no. They rowed because it\u2019s good to do a thing that requires every muscle and none of your brain, and the lake laid itself out like a patient that trusted them to do no harm.\n\nThey caught nothing and told each other the old lies because they fit the mouth like hymns. His father told him again the story of the 1956 fish and the punch line\u2014third place in a contest no one remembers and a reputation in a family who remembers everything\u2014and they laughed because repetition is the glue in love. On the slow tack back to shore, his father didn\u2019t clear his throat so much as he pressed a button on his chest that made a different register come out. \u201cI had a letter once,\u201d he said, and watched the oars so he didn\u2019t have to watch his son in the say it. \u201cWhen I was the night man at the high school. Anonymous. Said if I didn\u2019t leave the auditorium door a bit cracked on the night of the spring dance, so-and-so would make sure my\u2026 my lazy work was noted in the board minutes. Spelled lazy with an s like a snake hissing at me. I told your mother. She said, \u2018You tell your own story, not the snake\u2019s.\u2019 I locked the door and sat in a chair with my thermos and read a paperback and when the snake did not get his way he melted and left a smear on the back step that wiped up easy. Those boys\u2014because it was boys\u2014grew up to sell insurance and apologize to my face in the Safeway. I accepted without letting them make me the priest who absolved them.\u201d\n\nOwen listened like a man pulling in a net and hoping not to haul up his own foot. It made something click to hear the line run back that far, to know the town\u2019s foolishness was not new and his position in it was less visionary than he sometimes lets himself believe. \u201cI don\u2019t get to be the priest either,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t mind being the guy with the towel when there\u2019s a spill. You always liked the towel guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all I ever wanted to be,\u201d his father said, and then laughed in that way that makes other people at the lake turn their heads and approve.\n\nThe week rounded its shoulders and carried on, new grooves and old habits braiding themselves into a pattern Owen could trust by feel. Joel\u2019s first Saturday at the skatepark looked like a parable for humility; Brayden filmed a fifteen-second clip that made it to the town\u2019s bulletin on social, a slice of sun and paint and a man being taught to keep his lines straight by a thirteen-year-old with an earnestness that made people forget the anonymous and remember the named. The messages to Mira stopped except the good ones, the ones that used too many exclamation marks because you could taste the sweetness behind them and you didn\u2019t care if punctuation suffered. Vernon sent an email full of capital letters about an Oktoberfest that would happen in September because he refuses to be told by calendar what joy looks like, and attached three spreadsheets that announced themselves as \u201cfun\u201d as if adjectives could perform miracles when asked nicely.\n\nIn the municipal building, the inspectors came, and the chairs were wiped, and the water cooler hissed when its bottle was replaced with the sound of a snake who had decided not to bite. Inez knitted a sleeve for the shared remote control and labeled it Remote Remorse because she had run out of phrases for kindness and was moving into small acts of redemption. Darlene bought new mop heads out of her own budget and sent the receipt to Accounts with the subject line \u201cSanity,\u201d and when the reimbursement came back three weeks later with a smiley face, she framed the post-it because you frame small victories the same way you frame your children\u2019s finger paintings, with seriousness and pride.\n\nOn a Thursday that tried on wind just to see how it looked with the trees, Owen stood in the bakery doorway with a bag he was pretending he had not intended to fill and watched Mira balance a tray on her arm like a dancer who had traded pirouettes for the practical ballet of getting hot things to safe places. The radio was playing something with fiddles that made you imagine flat roads and loyal dogs, and her hair had escaped its long-suffering knot in two places and was doing opinionated curls near her ear. He felt the want that had snuck up on him over months like a dog that had decided he was worth following and decided to do the stupid brave thing and answer it before it wore him out.\n\n\u201cDo you want to watch a documentary about bread with me,\u201d he asked, and his voice came out in the register of men who have seen better attempts in their head and are going to stand by this one anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s very earnest and I think we can make fun of it and also cry.\u201d\n\nShe set the tray down in a way that told him she had not burned herself more than was acceptable for the time of day, and she studied him as if he were a recipe that had forgotten to list the butter but clearly included it somewhere. \u201cThat is the best possible way to spend a night I can imagine and also a terrible way to make me pretend I don\u2019t actually care about it,\u201d she said. \u201cYes. There should be popcorn. And you have to promise not to say \u2018gluten\u2019 like people say it on TV.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will say it like a hymn,\u201d he said. \u201cI will honor its syllables. I will bring the kind of salt that sticks to your fingers.\u201d\n\nThey did watch it and they did both nearly cry when a French man touched dough like it was a sleepy child and they did eat too much popcorn because balance is for mornings with meetings. He fell asleep later with the smell of yeast and butter and television light in his hair and woke up unafraid of his phone, which was a gift he noticed and did not ridicule. When he checked it, it had only a picture from Brick of a perogy shaped accidentally but unmistakably like Alberta, with the caption \u201cfound your province in the pan\u201d and three fire emojis that Brick used sparingly, as all thinking men should.\n\nOn a late night when the building was almost all hushed and the light in the council chamber made the room look like a painting that someone had left on a bus, Owen did the rounds that always bring him back to the start of things. He checked the handles without making it about the old superstition that if you don\u2019t, something breaks purely out of spite. He turned off the last hum with a touch he had perfected and knew he\u2019d miss if he ever left, the way you miss a particular banister when you move houses. In the dark, the glass did its trick and gave him himself without the polite lies light tells. He lifted his keys and they made their aural confession, honest and small, and he confessed back without words. Outside, heat had made friends with night and the air smelled like cut grass and the faint ghost of someone grilling two blocks over. He walked toward home with his day folded under his arm like a towel that had done its work and would be clean again in the morning, and he let himself be exactly as okay as he was, which turned out, for a Thursday, to be more than good enough.",

                              "content": "Chapter 9\n\nSeptember walked in with its collar up and its hands full of apples. The mornings started late and ended early, and the daylight in between lost that summer swagger and became something more precise, like a teacher tapping a board with a pointer. The municipal building felt it in its bones. The air vents found a new rattle, the glass held handprints longer, and the hall outside the council chamber kept a faint smell of pencil shavings that arrived with committees and left with arguments. Owen carried his bucket like a man bringing water to a tiny, thirsty republic, and the mop head fanned itself across tile in straight gospel lines. By eight he\u2019d talked to three different stains about redemption and to one maintenance guy about a hinge that insisted on singing in B-flat when it closed.\n\nThe town did its seasonal costume change without any fuss. Vernon hung a banner in the lobby that said OKTOBERFEST in letters so cheerful they needed to be sounded out twice, and then marched out the door with two clipboards and a look that suggested clipboards might mate in captivity and produce little clip-children. Inez knitted in primary colors and declared she\u2019d begun on a second goat sweater because the first had turned out less like a garment and more like a friendly puzzle. Darlene taped a note to her own door that read No, I Cannot Approve Your Pumpkin Spice Use of the Copier, Love You, which drew three laughs and one carefully constructed complaint from a man who could write official emails about anything.\n\nMira\u2019s chalkboard took on gourds. She drew a pumpkin that was somehow both smug and self-conscious and wrote, Be kind to each other and to pastry, the former being difficult some days, and the latter being an insult to pastry if attempted without tenderness. The afternoons in the bakery were warmer than outside, proof that ovens change the seasons on their own schedule. She had the grant application spread across the back counter one Monday like a map of a place she\u2019d never visited but wanted desperately to say she\u2019d been. It was the unromantic kind of paperwork, the sort that asks you to count things you haven\u2019t counted before: hours on task, kilograms of flour per week, the number of times a day you reach for a bowl that would be better placed four inches to the left.\n\n\u201cYou ever notice how math is both infuriating and reassuring,\u201d she said, pencil behind her ear and an inch of focus in front of her that nobody got to touch. \u201cIt\u2019s like, here, quantify your dreams, and also, look, your dreams can be quantified and now you can move them around on a piece of paper until they fit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve noticed math can save you from your feelings,\u201d he said, stealing a glance at the oven clock like it could keep time on his behalf. \u201cAnd then your feelings crawl back in from the side door and ask if you\u2019d like some tea.\u201d\n\nShe smiled without looking up, and he felt that small victory sit honestly in his stomach. They had watched the bread documentary and been both cynical and moved in the right proportions, and now their conversations had pockets, secret and useful, they could reach into when a day required it. He didn\u2019t call it anything; he didn\u2019t have to. Words like Beck and Courtship sound like Victorian letters and turn perfectly good realities into plays.\n\nVernon\u2019s Oktoberfest was not in October, which he said was a tradition if you said it into a microphone and people clapped. He booked the hall for the second Friday in September because he\u2019d been outmaneuvered by a quilting convention and took the defeat with the grace of a man who would one day name a pavilion after himself. The plan involved oompah at a polite volume, sausages sourced from a German grocer tucked beside a tire shop, and a beer garden that would serve a local lager in biodegradable cups that promised to break down nicely in landfills like well-behaved ghosts. He wanted string lights, three food trucks, a polka lesson, and a mercy station for men who wore their leather shorts ironically and found irony cold.\n\nOwen watched the setup with a fondness that had very little to do with the event and everything to do with the way a town makes a stage out of what it already has. He hauled barricades like they were furniture for a room he\u2019d one day get to sit in, and he told a teenager how to untangle extension cords without cursing them into snakes. The cool in the air made the cords feel like obedient rope, and when the bulbs blinked in sequence, the lights made the parking lot look suddenly European if you squinted and had a generous heart.\n\nHe was thinking about mirrors and floors and that particular way dusk falls over rectangles of asphalt when Lowe slid up beside him like an apology that had found its place. \u201cTwo things,\u201d the constable said, and offered him a timbit like a peace offering he hadn\u2019t asked for and was glad to receive. \u201cJoel\u2019s made it through two Saturdays without sabotaging anything more significant than his own ego, and a grandmother named Svitlana made him cry twice in one afternoon by calling him honey and showing him how to hold a roller. Also, the bakery texts seem to have stopped. Not idle hands. Something more like distracted hands. Whoever it was has moved on or been moved.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou talk to all your suspects like that,\u201d Owen asked, not wanting to give relief too much of the stage in case it took advantage and refused to exit. \u201cDistracted hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tell part-timers to keep their hands where I can see them, and I tell worry to sit on the back step,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cYou good if I bring my girl to the polka thing and teach her how to step without stepping on me. I want her to know a little ridiculous is the only way to carry adulthood.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ever the picture of composure,\u201d Owen said, because he has learned that teasing is love if it lands right, and Lowe\u2019s grin took it in like a dog given its favorite word.\n\nThere were small dramas and none grew teeth. Vernon\u2019s rented sound system fought him for two hours and then suddenly decided to be agreeable, like a cat you\u2019ve humiliated yourself for finally stepping into your lap. The bratwurst arrived two hours early and had to be convinced to nap politely in warming trays, which they did until one burst in protest and gave a teenager a story. A woman in a dirndl made from what had once been an Ikea curtain told Cannon she wasn\u2019t impressed by his chewing speed and then asked for a selfie, just to keep the universe on its toes. Brick learned to polka in a way that used all his corners and half of his caution, and when he got it right he looked like a house learning to float. Owens\u2019s father came for an hour, insisted he could waltz over a polka any day, proved it on the corner near the beer tent, and then bowed with a flourish that made three women decide he was charming and one man decide that maybe he did understand what it was to carry a day without complaint.\n\nIn the midst of this, there was a quiet thing. Mira stood at the edge of the lights with a paper cup of beer she would not finish, the foam marking how sentimental she was willing to get. She had on a cardigan that had seen winters and a skirt that carried conversations. She caught his eye, then let it go, then caught it again, and when he crossed over the asphalt in three steps because the music had made his predictability take a seat, she held up a piece of paper folded into a square as if it were a small creature she\u2019d chosen to release or keep.\n\n\u201cThey want me to come and pitch in person,\u201d she said, and kept her voice steady because if she let it wobble the whole world would wobble with it. \u201cI sent the numbers, and now they want to see the person who wrote the numbers. The man in the office said, \u2018We like a story to go with our spreadsheets,\u2019 and I didn\u2019t tell him the story was that I can cry at the sight of flour measuring itself into a bowl.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to go and talk about dough like it\u2019s destiny and they\u2019ll give you money because even people who count coins for a living have mouths and you can feed a mouth into a mind,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t, you\u2019ll make the second oven happen anyway, and someday they\u2019ll buy your column in a newspaper that still allows language that tastes good.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a menace when you\u2019re supportive,\u201d she said, but could not help the way her mouth softened in appreciation. \u201cYou and Inez and your father is going to show up and clap from the hallway, isn\u2019t he.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will pretend to be part of a tour and then stares at the wall and cry a little,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will bring him a muffin to excuse his presence.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease bring him two muffins,\u201d she said. \u201cI need him on my side of the ledger.\u201d\n\nThe week that followed was the kind that looks ordinary from the sidewalk and turns out, upon closer inspection, to be full of small shifts. Joel\u2019s restitution moved from awkward apologies to a kind of workmanlike relief. He fixed a handle in the community center that had squealed for a decade and looked two inches taller for having made something better with a screwdriver and a promise. Brayden took to following him like a well-intentioned mosquito, buzzing with ideas for how to improve the flow of people at events and the positioning of trash cans to maximize compliance. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you put the cans in a circle and call it art,\u201d Vernon said, overhearing and slipping into the conversation in that way he has of arriving just after he\u2019s needed to be there, \u201cif it gets us fewer ketchup tragedies.\u201d\n\nThe bakery had its own tiny revolution. A second-hand store in Devon closed in mourning after the last of its bruise-colored cardigans had been bought and the owner decided fishing was a better use of shoulders. In the back, an oven sat with a sign taped to it that said, Works Fine, We Just Stopped. Mira heard about it via the intricate grapevine of women who have moved towns but not lost their capacity to know where the good things are. She wanted the oven and didn\u2019t have the truck or the arm strength alone, and Owen made the calls, and Brick arrived with a borrowed trailer and the grin of a man who loves nothing more than a heavy object and permission to lift.\n\nThey made an afternoon of it. They wrapped the thing in moving blankets like overprotective aunts, they strapped it down so gently that the oven would later say, if it could speak, it had never felt so safe, and they drove that ugly metal beauty along back roads that made the journey feel like a secret and a promise. Mira sat in the lead car and refused to look back because if you look back at cargo you love, you invite fate to show off. Owen watched the mirror because that is how he functions in the world: forward, sideways, backward, keeping three narratives stitched to a single road. They arrived without mishap, which felt like a miracle only because so many things don\u2019t, and they slid the oven into the bakery with the hush of a large thing deciding to be home.\n\nIt told the room it was a worker, not a diva. The old oven gave it a look that said, we will either be friends or partners who irritate each other professionally, and the new oven preheated like it knew it was being tested. Mira fed it a small tray of shortbread as a courtesy. The kitchen filled with that butter sum that can make a funeral bearable and a Tuesday less mean. Sanjay, notified via text and lured by the scent like any sensible man, dropped in with his thermometer holstered like a peacekeeper and approved it by giving it a nickname. \u201cShe is a Lark,\u201d he said, patting the side with professional affection that could yet be denied. \u201cDo not question my instincts. She will sing for you.\u201d\n\nShe did. The second oven cracked the bakery\u2019s day open in a way Mira had expected in a spreadsheet and still couldn\u2019t quite believe in her hands. The racks filled with twice the number of croissants and yet none had to be rushed; the pies baked in pairs like twins who don\u2019t mind sharing toys; the morning felt less like a sprint and more like a steady run with breath you could keep. She wrote her pitch for the grant between turns of dough and smudged adjectives with butter without apology. She practiced aloud once, only once, in the back room with her hair feral and the flour motes drifting like a snowfall that had forgotten its season. Owen heard the rhythm from the front and felt something like pride that you get to feel only if you\u2019ve held a flashlight in someone\u2019s flood.\n\nBecause the world does not believe in a single plot line for a life, the day of the pitch was also the day of a minor pestilence. The municipal building\u2019s second-floor men\u2019s room decided to have feelings about its plumbing. At nine, it gurgled as if remembering a song. At ten, it lied and pretended it was fine. At eleven, it attempted to cascade. Owen was there because of course he was, with towels folded precisely like the Navy teaches and a plunger with a handle he\u2019d sanded down himself because splinters are a metaphor nobody needs. He shut the valve by feel and by muttered encouragement, and he stood in rubber boots while water made its case and lost, slow enough for a man to maintain dignity and fast enough that the floor didn\u2019t need a sermon, only a mop.\n\nIt was not how anyone wants to spend an hour, but it was a kind of blessed contrast. Mira texted him a thumbs-up as she walked into a room full of folding chairs and three people in business casual making their own faces presentable to strangers. He texted back a picture of a towel and the words Holding the line, which is what it always is. She stood at the front of the room and told them about ovens and mornings and the geometry of circles you fill with fruit and hope, told them about teenagers who need a job that is both simple and exacting so they can practice focus without a screen, told them about the economy of cities that understand that bread and coffee are not extras but infrastructure. She did not cry because the part of her she\u2019d prepared did not need to, and the part of her that gets weepy did so later in the stairwell where no one would think they had caused it.\n\nShe came out with practical instructions for next steps and a look he would come to recognize, a look that said, whether or not they said yes, I was true to my own version of events. They all celebrated as if the yes had already arrived because there are days you need to lead a cheer into the room and let the yes catch up later. He brought his father, who acted casual, and Inez, who did not, and Brick, who ate four cinnamon rolls and cried twice during a polka that came on the radio by accident. Cannon came by with his girlfriend and let Mira put him behind the counter for five minutes; he froze at the register in the way giants freeze and then recovered with an apology so charming no one could hold it against him.\n\nThe grant committee\u2019s yes came by email on a Tuesday as the leaves began to commit to their yellows. It was not dramatic. It did not come with balloons or an official knocking on a door the way you might fantasize when you\u2019re twelve and the world feels like a comic book. It came with three bullet points and a PDF attachment and a request for proper receipts. Mira sat on the back step with her phone and made a sound that was two parts laugh, one part relief, and stirred it with a fork. She texted him the three letters and a photo of her shoes, and he got the message on a ladder in the lobby changing a bulb and had to make a decision about whether to climb down to be dignified or to shout from the rung. He climbed down and went to the bakery and she kissed his cheek with a quiet he knew not to narrate.\n\nOver at the skatepark, the restorative Saturdays grew less performative and more real. Joel had begun to bring small things from home to repair more small things on site\u2014a screwdriver with a handle that fit his palm, a roll of tape that seemed like it might save a life if wrap were a category of sacrament\u2014and the kids needed him less for instruction and more for presence. Brayden declared him \u201cnot awful\u201d in front of his friends, which anyone who knows teenagers knows is a benediction, and the older men who leaned on the metal fence pretending to supervise learned to say hello without an edge. Lowe stopped by and watched from the shade, making himself perfectly ignorable, and let a half-smile haunt the corner of his mouth when a boy said to another without meaning to be profound, \u201cIt feels better when it looks better,\u201d because there it was, the slogan for every effort undertaken by people like Owen and Joel and all their quiet kind.\n\nOne message found its way under Owen\u2019s door that month, a last vestige of anonymity that felt more like a habit than a threat. It was a list torn from a spiral notebook, spiky handwriting that had learned in school to be legible and had since chosen drama. It said, Be careful who you help. It had no signature and no return to sender, and he read it, then read it again, then set it under the coaster on his table with the photograph from months ago. He did not send it to Lowe because he did not want to build a case on crumbs. He did tell Inez, who sniffed and said, \u201cEveryone who writes on spiral paper like that thinks they\u2019re the hand of fate. If fate has a hand, it does not choose budget office supplies,\u201d and then knitted faster, which is her way of cursing in public.\n\nMore days stacked. He built and rebuilt the path from door to door, swept and mopped and buffed, and took satisfaction in the way the floor tells you when you\u2019ve done it right without asking for thanks. He and Mira sat in her kitchen on a night that was finally cold and ate soup like it was a form of justification. They made a game of naming everything they were grateful for that wasn\u2019t a thing you can take a picture of. He picked the silence right after a laugh that means you\u2019ve hit something true; she picked the moment when a room takes your shape and relaxes because it recognizes you. He said the smell of his father\u2019s tea, never the taste. She said her landlord\u2019s habit of telling bad jokes and then apologizing to the room for having told them. He laughed until his throat went soft and then admitted he had begun to think of the bakery as a place he could keep his hands, like a bench with his name written under it in pencil.\n\nOctober chose not to enter quietly after all. The first cold morning fogged the windows with wet breath and pretended not to be winter. Vernon announced, because there are always announcements, that he had booked a choir for the pumpkin lighting, that there would be a prize for the best carved gourd that was not scary because the yelps of children are fun only in their first syllable, and that he needed someone to hold a ladder because the fairy lights he\u2019d borrowed had opinions and those opinions were hung four inches out of his reach. Owen held the ladder because of course he did. Brick held the other side and shouted exaggerated cautionary phrases every three seconds to make the children laugh and the parents relax into their posture. Cannon arrived with a box of donuts and was tolerated because he is both chaos and on-brand kindness, and all the teenagers with phones filmed the lights going on like they had never seen lights do that before, which is one of the lovelier lies we tell ourselves.\n\nMira lit the first pumpkin and pretended not to like being asked to. She allowed the moment on her face and then filed it away under the section in her head labeled Things You Don\u2019t Have to Talk About to Keep. Her second oven sang softly; you could hear it in the tone of her day. The grant money arrived in pieces because money never arrives all at once unless you are being struck by a bus or hit by fright, and she counted it like prayers and spent it like strategy. She ordered a stainless table and a second mixer that looked like it could pull a tractor, and she hired a teenager who came with a reference from Brayden, which is to say she came with a willingness to be teased and a capacity to take instruction without dissolving. She named the girl Tully in her head because the girl had misheard a greeting and replied, \u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d and sometimes a town gives you your name whether you are prepared to legally accept it or not.\n\nIn a week stitched together with sleep and sugar, Owen\u2019s father turned seventy, though he refused to say the number out loud because numbers are fun until they aren\u2019t. He agreed to a cake at the bakery against his own inclination, and what followed was less a party and more a visitation. People came by as if they had appointments and he said hello to them as if they had just dropped off a book. Mira made a chocolate cake that was not austere and not silly; it was serious fun, and the frosting shone like a polished shoe. Inez wrapped a bow around a tin of cookies and told him to open it in an hour because some pleasures require a schedule. Lowe dropped a card in Owen\u2019s pocket addressed in small precise letters and escaped back into the warm. Brick hung back because he felt too big for the room, then came forward when Owen pulled him with a look, and told the old man that his son was the sort of man who quietly saves entire days and never tells anyone, and the way his father said, I know, had Wednesday mornings and long-ago thermoses in it.\n\nThe message under the coaster didn\u2019t turn into a pattern, and that was perhaps the point. Not everything will. He caught himself hoping it had been a final fling of attention and not the opening of a new act, and then he told himself not to practice dread like it was an instrument worth learning. He promised himself instead to keep doing the thing he knew how to do, to mop and to lift and to look, and to say yes to the things that got his heart to move forward. He said yes to one more polka where he and Mira pretended their feet were smarter than their heads and it turned out their feet were kind. He said yes to a small road trip to pick up a set of shelves from a woman who used the phrase \u201cshabby chic\u201d without irony and who fed them orange slices in a way that made the day feel like a kindergarten class. He said yes to an early morning when the sky cracked open pink and a man with a broom watched the light make the dust on his floor look like glitter for half a second before it became ordinary again.\n\nThe pumpkin lighting happened under a sky that understood the assignment. Dusk took its time and let the choir\u2019s breath rise in white puffs that made the notes look like they might have a body. Vernon tried to coordinate six things with eight hands and succeeded because five other pairs of hands appeared where needed, and the teenagers who used to move cones for sport now moved them into perfect lines as if they had been converted to a religion whose saint is Flow. Joel was there, standing beside Brayden with a posture that didn\u2019t need a special vocabulary, and when they nodded at Owen across the lights it wasn\u2019t a secret handshake so much as an agreement among custodians.\n\nThey lit the pumpkins in a line that looked like a sentence the town was writing to itself. The faces were not all pretty. Some were aggressively goofy. One looked like the artist had despised the world that day and tried to carve it into submission. One had no face at all but had been turned into a lighthouse with a careful chisel and a battery-powered candle. Children squealed in the right way and a dog barked twice and accepted the night as arranged. Brick couldn\u2019t stop grinning and Cannon managed to hand a donut to a crying toddler without being accused of interference in the child\u2019s necessary developmental crisis. Mira leaned into Owen\u2019s shoulder in a way he nearly didn\u2019t notice because it is sometimes how a life sneaks by: with the normal weight of a person you already know by smell.\n\nAt the very edge of the evening, when the last plastic cup had been chased across the parking lot and the lights hummed with that end-of-shift music they make when they know they are about to go dark, a woman Owen did not recognize watched him coil an extension cord and approached as if asking a favor were a hobby. She was in her thirties, maybe, younger if you were generous, older if you had spent any time looking into faces and counting the inches of history. She had a coat that would not be warm enough in an hour and a posture that said she was about to tell a story she both wanted and did not want to tell.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the janitor,\u201d she said, and he nodded because a man should agree to his place in the scheme of things at least once a day. \u201cYou work with Darlene. You\u2019re\u2014Halvorsen.\u201d\n\n\u201cOwen,\u201d he said, watching without staring because you can learn as much from what people are not asking for as you can from their words. \u201cYou need a mop or a key or a hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cA key,\u201d she said, not smiling. \u201cTo something else. I\u2014All right. I did some dumb. I sent some things I shouldn\u2019t. Not to you. I mean. To the bakery woman. The texts. I thought\u2014who knows what I thought. I thought she took something from me that was mine. It wasn\u2019t mine, it was an idea and you can\u2019t own ideas any more than you can own a sky. I thought I was making the playing field even because she had a line out the door and my cupcakes looked like a funeral even when it wasn\u2019t one. Then\u2026 I saw her at the inspection that day. The man was so careful with her. It made me feel like a clumsy person in a china shop. I\u2019ve been sticking receipts under her door like a teenager and you can tell me to go take a long walk off a short ridge. I\u2019m tired of carrying a story that isn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nHe stood still because this is what you do when truth approaches with its hat in its hand. He waited for the part where she named herself, because that can make the difference between repair and ritual. \u201cHeather,\u201d she said after a pause, and the name fitted the look if you knew old high school yearbooks and the way hair gets cut when you can finally afford to pay someone to not make you look like your aunt. \u201cHeather Woldt. I do cakes in Stony. Weddings. I thought. I got so scared that she would\u2026 I don\u2019t want to be the villain in a town with this few villains. You tell me what penance is. Don\u2019t tell me to be her friend. We are not the same kind of people.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t want to be the priest. He remembered, from the boat with his father, how easy it is to assign yourself the mantle of forgiver and end up wearing it like a costume that doesn\u2019t fit. \u201cYou tell her,\u201d he said. \u201cYou tell her in a way that doesn\u2019t make her do any work to comfort you. And then you leave her alone unless she asks you to do something different. And you make your cakes like the world depends on them, which it does for the two hours people cut them and say vows. I will tell Lowe because I promised him I\u2019d tell him about puzzle pieces. He will act like it\u2019s not a big deal and then he\u2019ll write it down because that is how he remains sound. And you stop using anything but your name. If you can\u2019t, you come here at nine on a Wednesday, and Inez will look at you until you do the right thing.\u201d\n\nHeather laughed and then made the face of a person surprised by her own laugh. \u201cInez is a witch in the best possible meaning,\u201d she said in a tone that intended respect. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll go tell the pastry woman I was awful. She will either network it into a polite handshake or strip me of my epidermis with her eyes. I will accept either.\u201d\n\nWhen she\u2019d gone, with her coat not warm enough and her step resolved, Owen felt the place behind his lungs light and dim like the pilot in an old furnace. It wasn\u2019t triumph. It wasn\u2019t even relief quite. It was that gentle shift you get when a long, small wrong tips back toward right, and you don\u2019t have to hold yourself at an angle anymore. He told Lowe and let the man be thorough. He told Mira and let her be kind without being a doormat. He did not tweet or post or tell Brick because it wasn\u2019t story for entertainment; it was the workplace of forgiveness, and you don\u2019t take pictures there.\n\nThe pumpkins softened over the next few days, as pumpkins do, and the town passed small decrees about when it is appropriate to throw beauty into the compost. The wind found a new edge, the sky traded one blue for another, the bench outside the municipal building grew cold in the morning and then warm and then cold again. The perogy charity sent a thank-you card with far too many exclamation points because gratitude cannot be calibrated when onions are involved. The second oven learned the voice of Mira\u2019s days and made it easier for her to stand up straight. The keys in Owen\u2019s pocket made their soft map of a man\u2019s movements, and he traced it not as a routine but as a practice.\n\nOne evening he took his father to the footbridge behind the arena where you can watch the pond consider freezing and the geese plot their commute. They stood with their hands in their jackets and their breath in front of them, and said the kind of things two men say when a month has been both eventful and ordinary. \u201cI get to be useful,\u201d Owen said, not being specific because he didn\u2019t need to be.\n\n\u201cYou always did,\u201d his father said. \u201cIt\u2019s just easier to tell now. It shows better in this light.\u201d\n\nHe thought about light and how it gives, how a floor absorbs it and throws it back, how a window accepts it and shares it, how a pumpkin hoards it for a while and releases it like gossip. He thought about the bakery, about the municipal building, about the reef of chairs in the council chamber that he could navigate in the dark with only his knee. He thought about Mira\u2019s hands and the way they make circles that change the mood of an entire room. He thought of promises made to angry texts, to leaky valves, to plants with cameras behind them, to men who\u2014given instruction and a team and a forgiveness that had structure, not sugar\u2014remembered how to be part of a town instead of its antagonist.\n\nIt was enough, for that month, to walk home with the smells of October in his scarf and to have nothing louder to report to his own head than the inventory of his day. The front step had leaves gathered at its crook like gossiping aunts. He swept them into a pile and let the wind have some because partnership is all, even with breezes. He hung his keys on their hook and the sound was the one he\u2019d known since he\u2019d learned to listen for it. He made tea badly and buttered bread properly. He set the photograph back under the coaster and whispered nothing in particular into the room, which received it and sent it back in the form of a quiet that was not empty. He slept without waiting for his phone to light, his ribs at last behaving themselves like a choir after rehearsal, and dreamed only of floors that gleamed because someone loved them by hand.",
