     "novel_text": "In the mornings the D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba looked like a ribbon of rumpled foil, dented by wind and single leaves, gulls, the light from a sky that couldn't decide if it would be bright or sullen. Ileana stooped over her balcony and counted\u2014out loud, if no one else was near\u2014the number of taxis that refused to stop at the crosswalk. Numbers steadied her. She could make lists until the coffee cooled. She could balance ledgers while thunder rolled. She had made a company out of a threadbare idea and an empty spare room, and sometimes when she forgot to breathe she would remember that, would hold it like a coin. But lately the numbers had been stubborn as nettles.\n\n\"Three shipments stuck, one client audibly breathing into my ear to intimidate me,\" she told the empty air and the one small rosemary bush that Marius had coaxed onto the sill. \"Singura veselie, rosemary is alive. Good. Bine.\"\n\nThe rosemary wavered. Below, the courtyard rattled with the sounds of buckets, hose, an old radio tuned to a station that played songs from the nineties and advertisements for paint. Marius had the kind of face that didn't reveal much unless he wanted it to. He wore a cap even in sun and a jacket through spring, and every day he swept the same arcs of dust as if they were lines he alone could see. He nodded when he sensed eyes on him\u2014not looking up, not exactly\u2014like an old horse. He had been hired by the building association and somehow ended up trusted with keys to lockers, boiler room, a shed where he stacked sapling stakes, old wires, sacks of gravel. People said he slept somewhere behind the tool wall when it rained.\n\nAt the corner of the kitchen table, Ileana's phone blinked with an email alert like a small heartbeat. Her investor, Sorin, had sent a message at midnight: we need to discuss direction. He always wrote like he was dictating to a mirror. The direction he wanted leaned toward importing cheaper things for faster money, whittling costs until the spine of the business snapped. She had resisted for months, and now they had their first true fight scheduled. She set the coffee down and decided there was no more delaying the tiny errand she'd invented for herself\u2014Obor market, just for twenty minutes, to buy three lemons and maybe something else. Something her hands could carry that wasn't a contract.\n\nOn the tram she stood, because everyone stood, men pretending they hadn't seen her, women with elbows sharper than knives. She watched the city blur and wished it would slow like breath. At the market's edge the air changed\u2014onions, fried dough, clatter\u2014and then she saw a table that made her stop, made everything inside her slow until the noise deferred. The table overflowed with flowers, but not flowers: paper\u2014crepe, tissue, streamers cut into fringes\u2014twisted and dyed into peonies, carnations, scraggly little daisies with yellow centers that were too cheerful to be real. The woman behind the table had bracelets up both arms. Her hair was threaded with ribbon; she had a missing tooth and the most patient eyes.\n\nIleana's fingers reached, ridiculous. One rose, deep red, curled like a tongue. She didn't touch it. She was thirty-six, she knew what a day ought to look like. Numbers. Lemon. Maybe cigarettes, if the stress convinced her into the old habit. Not paper roses.\n\n\"Frumoas\u0103, nu?\" the woman said, tipping her head. \"You can touch. They like it when you touch. Otherwise they think they are just fake, s\u0103racele.\"\n\n\"I didn't bring cash,\" Ileana lied, and then felt her wallet heavy in her bag. She didn't want to be pulled into a conversation. She didn't want to explain why she was paused here like a child at a circus window. \"Maybe next week.\"\n\n\"Next week they will be different.\" The woman pinched the edge of a petal and teased it outward until it cupped perfectly. \"Today they are this shape. Tomorrow they will be that shape. Because of your hands. Because of how you look at them.\"\n\n\"Soft sales pitch,\" Ileana said, and the woman laughed. It was a low, generous laugh that rolled between the stalls, scandalizing a fishmonger who had spent two hours arranging his sardines by angle. \"I'm sorry. I'm late.\"\n\n\"Five minutes,\" the woman said. \"I show you how to make one? Free. For your hands, yes? They are kind hands. I can see.\"\n\n\"I do logistics,\" Ileana said, and felt a strange flinch at how that sounded right then, a gray word in a place full of nail polish and frying oil and fruit. \"Between Constan\u021ba and... this.\" She drew a line in the air. \"I don't make. I order. I nag.\"\n\n\"You breathe,\" the woman said, unfazed. \"That's enough. Sit.\"\n\nIt was an insult to hurry past someone who had offered generosity so directly. Ileana sat on the rickety plastic chair and looked at the woman's hands. They were nicked, strong, motherly. \"I'm Luminita,\" she said, and pushed a wad of crepe paper at Ileana. \"Stretch it. Look. Not too much. It tears if you pull like you pull onto traffic on \u0218tefan cel Mare.\"\n\n\"I never\u2014\" Ileana started to protest, then laughed at the accuracy. Her hands obeyed the paper, making a saucer shape she didn't know she could make. Fold. Pinch. Twist wire. Turn slowly. She did as she was told. The petals formed without drama. A flower with inexact perfection\u2014hers\u2014looked up at her as if expecting to be named.\n\n\"You see?\" Luminita's bracelets clinked softly. \"Everyone thinks it's only for cemeteries. Or for some country wedding where the bride's uncle has money for a B-series but not for tulips. They say it's kitsch. They all say: h\u0103-h\u0103, paper. It can't breathe. They say a lot. But look.\" She held the flower up and turned it so the stall's shadow moved over it like a cloud. \"It catches the same light.\"\n\n\"It's beautiful.\" Ileana blurted it, surprised by the ring of truth, like a glass he had struck. \"It's\u2026 Not just beautiful. It feels like the thing stands in for time. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\"You talk like a woman who has argued for something until she forgot her own ears,\" Luminita said gently. \"Here. Take it. And if you want, Thursday night, a small class in the community room under the stadium. Ten lei. I will teach you to cut the fringe for peonies. Bring scissors that will forgive you.\"\n\n\"I have... I have meetings,\" Ileana said. \"I'm sorry. I...\"\n\n\"Your face says 'meetings' and your hands say 'petals.' Decide which one you listen to later.\" Luminita winked. \"Thursday we are there. If you come, you come.\"\n\nShe put the flower in her tote like a bottle bomb and forced herself to move, to buy lemons that suddenly looked anemic compared to the paper bloom, to contact a driver about a delivery, to avoid looking back. On the tram home she stuck her nose near the paper and inhaled. It smelled like dye and dust, nothing of rose, and yet her throat strained as if it might find sweetness. She shook her head, ashamed of the sentimentality, almost angry at herself for having been the kind of woman who could be kidnapped by red. It was twelve minutes of her life. She would forget.\n\nShe did not forget. That night, after the email exchange with Sorin turned flinty, after a client called to say that he had found a cheaper supplier in Poland and maybe they could talk next quarter, after her mother phoned from Foc\u0219ani to examine the holes in her life\u2014\"Thirty-six, Ileana. The neighbor's daughter has two children and a lavatory with marble. And you? Ansamblul t\u0103u? Apartments are expensive now. I saw on TV\"\u2014after all of that, she took the flower out of her bag and put it on the kitchen table. The kitchen light made the red deepen. It was a modest thing, glued, imperfect, stubborn.\n\n\"Well?\" she demanded of it, as if it were a negotiator. \"What?\"\n\nThe rosemary plant didn't answer. Neither did the flower. The silence made space. She opened her laptop and googled paper flowers, then crepe paper, then flori din h\u00e2rtie like she remembered from childhood, when she had watched her grandmother's neighbor, a Roma seamstress, make coin garlands and paper blossoms for funerals. You made a tree, they said, for the dead. You hung sweets and bright paper birds, and after the ceremony children tore them down and ran away with mouths sticky with ritual. She felt something in her chest tip.\n\nOn Thursday night she went.\n\nShe told herself it was research. Logistics of a different product. She told herself she would be in the building for twenty minutes, and then she would dash to a late dinner with a client who needed handholding. She told herself she was not the kind of person who was swayed by small wonders. She told herself many things and carried her grandmother's old sewing scissors in her bag like talisman. The community room smelled of rain and old gym shoes. Luminita had dragged in folding tables and her box of paper, and four other women already sat, arms crossed, daring themselves not to cry.\n\n\"We don't have to be sentimental,\" Luminita said, as if she'd heard every thought. \"We can make peonies and curse our exes and pay attention. That's enough.\"\n\nThey cut. They fringe-cut everything. Tissue into streamers, streamers into fringes so fine they stuck to their lips. They rolled and twisted and slid stems into green tape. Luminita kept repeating her one instruction\u2014breathe, breathe\u2014and when the tips of Ileana's fingers stained pink, she felt something like mercy. There was accomplishment that didn't involve a delivery window, a discount, a signature, a power suit. There was shape made out of flatness. Inside the bloom, she could see wrinkles she'd left like fingerprints.\n\n\"I used to do nails,\" a woman across the table announced, unwinding a ribbon of white. \"People looked at their phones the whole time. I thought: no more. These, they look back at you. They don't blink.\"\n\n\"At my wedding,\" said another, \"my husband's aunt put paper flowers in the icons. My grandmother said it was a bad sign.\" She shrugged. \"Thirty years and a mortgage later, I think she was wrong.\"\n\n\"I make them for graves too,\" Luminita said without flinching. \"I don't think it's bad. I think people need a color that doesn't leave them the next day.\"\n\nWhen Ileana got home, past eleven, Marius was closing the courtyard shed, the last thing he did before disappearing into whatever his life was. He smelled like wet leaves and cigarette smoke and the sharp tin of the old radio. The hose lay coiled like a sleeping snake. He nodded when he heard her step, as if he had known the pattern of her shoes for months.\n\n\"Is that paper?\" he asked, pointing with his chin at the bouquet peeking from her bag.\n\n\"It is,\" she said. \"Apparently I am twelve years old again.\"\n\n\"No. When we were little,\" he said, unusually talkative, \"my mother made them for parastas. For forty days, for a year. People laughed too. They said, why not real roses? She did both. She said the paper ones don't ask for water. The dead like things that don't ask.\" He looked away at nothing, at the oleanders that never flowered in Bucharest because someone always forgot to bring them inside for winter. \"We had a dog that used to steal one and run. He loved the wire. He thought it was a stick that fought back.\"\n\n\"You know how to make them?\"\n\n\"I know how to hold them,\" he said. His voice had that flatness that turned all statements into fact. \"And I know the wind that blows here. By morning if you leave them out they\u2019ll be in the gutter. The kids play football. They won't see. If you like them, keep them inside. People mistake carelessness for malice.\"\n\n\"I always do,\" she said, surprised that truth had slid out. Maybe it was the hour. \"I always think the missed call means someone hates me.\"\n\n\"You are not so important.\" He said it without meanness, and it stabbed then soothed. \"No one has time to hate you. They only forget. This is better. I like the red.\"\n\nUpstairs, she arranged them in a glass jar because she didn't own a proper vase. The old jar had a label half-peeled, and the glue was gummy under her thumb. She put the arrangement on her desk where, in the morning, it would catch the window's pale. She slept as if the entire day had not been made of sand.\n\nThe morning did not honor her with ease. Sorin arrived at the office with his expensive sad smile and the kind of cologne that left the room ten minutes after he did. He moved chair legs, looked at the flower jar, and chuckled.\n\n\"What are we selling now,\" he said, \"whimsy?\"\n\n\"Don't start,\" Ileana said, hating how small she sounded. \"They're a\u2014present.\"\n\n\"We need to talk margins,\" he said, as if the jar had not been there. \"We need to talk pivot, Ileana.\"\n\n\"I am bone-tired of your words,\" she snapped. \"Pivot. Synergy. The thing you want me to do is also simple to say: cheap. And I can't be that. Not now.\"\n\n\"We can be out,\" he said, looking toward the window the way he always did when he wanted to make an exit sound like an offer. \"Sell the last containers, pay off what we can, let it all set. There is a health products distributor that's buying. They are expanding. Supplements, tinctures. If we\u2014\"\n\n\"Do I look like a woman who can sleep if she gives up?\" she said. The flower in her eye's corner soothed nothing, couldn't even be used as a shield. \"Don't talk to me about health products. I have eaten crackers for dinner all week. I don't want to sell gel caps.\"\n\n\"You are sentimental lately,\" Sorin laughed, and it wasn't kind. \"Is there a man? Is there a\u2014\"\n\n\"Get out,\" she said, very softly. \"Please. Or drop it. We can argue later. Today I need to live out my day and not make a permanent decision that will make me disappointed in myself for five years.\"\n\nHe threw up his hands and gave her three hours, a mercy he would later charge her for. She sat, pressed her fingers between her eyes until little stars burst there, and let numbers line up like soldiers. She emailed and re-emailed. She told herself, when the room dimmed, that she was holding. For now.\n\nHer assistant, Mara, who was twenty-seven and never wasted feelings on things she could fix with sarcasm, leaned in with a box of staples and the look people wear when they're about to tell you a story you didn't consent to hear. \"My cousin saw you at Obor,\" she said. \"She said you were sitting with a woman who sells those tacky flowers. Her words, not mine.\" Mara put the staples down and rolled her eyes at the jar. \"My grandmother used to say paper flowers are either for brothels or for the cemetery. Choose your clientele.\"\n\n\"We have such a rich heritage,\" Ileana said dryly. \"Why are we even in the European Union? We have proverbs. We're full of advice.\"\n\n\"Tissue paper gives me hives,\" Mara said. \"Don't ask me why. You're allowed your eccentricities. Better paper than cats.\"\n\nThe teasing was kinder than the laugh had been. Even so, by lunch, Ileana hid the jar under her desk as if it were contraband. She walked to Baker's on the corner and ate a pretzel she didn't taste. Outside, a man with string-straight hair asked her for a cigarette, and she shook her head. On the way back a poster slapped the side of a bus: a baby smiling down at a bottle of cough syrup. The word \"homeopathy\" shrank and enlarged as the bus moved. It was a word she'd only thrown at in conversation as a joke, a reflex of skepticism. Water with a memory. She had pointed and laughed. But there it was, blue letters you could almost lean on, and something in her remembered her grandmother's cupboard full of tinctures with all the labels written by hand. After a fever, a drop under the tongue, the swell of sleep like wind under a kite.\n\n\"Don't be ridiculous,\" she told herself, hearing Mara's eye roll in her head. \"You are not going to go into sugar pills. You are not going to be a witch.\" Still, when she got home she typed the word into the search bar, then erased it, then retyped it and fell into the rabbit hole of cure-alls and quacks and earnest believers and studies with sample sizes so small you could hold them in a palm. It didn't matter. It was the feeling that did. The feeling that there might exist a way to help, however flawed, that wasn't spreadsheets or ports or Sorin's talk.\n\nOn Saturday, when she carried a paper bouquet to her friend Anca's daughter's birthday party, she did it with shame hot on her cheeks. She had never been embarrassed about taste; she had never been the woman who brought the wrong thing. But it was raining and the party was in a two-room flat in Militari, and Anca's mother came to the door with her hair wrapped in a towel and took the bouquet like it was a stranger who might steal silver. Inside, the children screamed at a purple-clad clown, sugar staining their teeth, and a woman by the window whispered \"mamaie, look, paper\" like an insult. The room coughed out a laugh. Anca hugged her and whispered, \"It's perfect,\" fierce enough to make Ileana believe it for a flicker, and then and then they put the bouquet near the TV, and the fourth child to have a balloon popped cried, and the clown tried to do magic with a coin. The paper flowers didn't wilt. Something about their stubbornness disturbed Ileana. She wanted them to be tender enough to fail.\n\nOn the way out it had stopped raining, the pavement spreading silver underfoot. In the courtyard of her building Marius was puzzling over the hinge on the big iron gate, throwing his weight against it in frustrated increments. \"It moans like a sick thing,\" he grunted.\n\n\"It sings like an opera,\" she said, because she couldn't manage a complaint. \"I brought you a piece of cake. Made of butter and regret.\"\n\n\"Regret is my favorite,\" he said without smiling, accepting the plastic plate. \"You look angry.\"\n\n\"I hate when people whisper. It's like gnats. Too small to squash. Do you know what I mean?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, and for perhaps the first time since she had met him, his face shifted, as if the underneath had moved. \"I do.\"\n\nIn the next week, small things turned and turned. An email thread that had been anemic warmed. A client returned, sheepish, because Poland hadn't sent what they promised. \"Fine,\" she wrote back, and then deleted the word \"fine\" because it felt like she was forgiving. She allowed herself coffee at noon. She let her phone ring without pouncing. She told Sorin she would meet him for a last talk at a cafe with walls painted dark as licorice. For the first time, she offered him a choice: buy her out or let her buy him. He was so surprised he did not speak for seconds. That seemed like progress.\n\nOn Thursday, her hands full of crepe forests, she walked out of Luminita's class and into the kind of evening Bucharest sometimes produced like an apology. The clouds had thinned enough to let bruised light through, and above the stadium's concrete, swifts reeled as if someone had shaken the sky. On the tram she stood again, pressed to the door by a suited man who breathed like a bull, and watched a boy of ten press his forehead to the window to fog it. He wrote a word into the fog. It was a name. The girl next to him blushed and pushed him in the arm and then wrote, below it, a small flower. The petals were lopsided. It was not exactly pretty. It was the best thing Ileana had seen all week.\n\nShe slept badly\u2014thunder took a giant step across the city\u2014and in the morning she went down to the courtyard early because she had left something in her car and also because she wanted air. Marius was there in the gray, tying a sapling to a stake with soft pantyhose strips. He had a cigarette stuck to the side of his mouth. He looked like he had been awake too long.\n\n\"These,\" he said without preamble, tapping the nail on the stake, \"are too thin. They will snap when the wind decides to come for real. I'll find better.\"\n\n\"Does the wind ask your permission?\" she teased, and then swallowed it. There was something in him today. A tension in the hand. The radio was off. The gate was ajar. A stray dog slept under the bench with its belly up like a question.\n\n\"Sometimes it does,\" he said. \"If you know its name.\"\n\n\"Come to the market with me this weekend,\" she said impulsively. \"We can buy better stakes. And\u2014no, sorry, I don't usually. Ask people to spend Saturday with me.\"\n\nHe looked at her as if she had said something very strange. Then he nodded once. \"Also we buy wire. Not the soft one that twists like sugar. The real one, with a bite. For your flowers.\" His face had gone unreadable again.\n\nNo one had asked her about her flowers as if they were anything other than hobby, as if she might require a better grade of supplies. It pierced her. \"Yes,\" she managed. \"For those.\"\n\nAt the market, he moved like a man who had directions from a map inside his bones, even though Ileana had never seen him out of the courtyard. They walked past stalls selling shoes that looked embarrassed to be shoes, past a table of cabbage pyramids so precise you could have split a hair with the lines between leaves. A vendor in a denim vest asked Marius if he wanted to bet on a fight; he ignored him. He chose wire with the way he chose his words: only when necessary; no ornament. Ileana bought paper in colors she had no names for. At Luminita's stall, the teacher pretended not to see Marius until he tipped his cap and then she laughed like a shout.\n\n\"Eh, Marius,\" she said. \"Look at you. Still choosing the straightest staves. Leave the girl the curved ones. It makes prettier stems.\"\n\n\"You know each other?\" Ileana asked, startled.\n\n\"Of course,\" Luminita said easily, using her chin to pry open a new box of green tape. \"He used to bring his mother here. She would sit and I would take her lists and sometimes she would buy nothing, only talk. She had a back that hurt like winter. She told good jokes. You still tell her jokes?\"\n\n\"They were hers,\" he said, and that was that. There was a small silence in which the market seemed to breathe. Then Luminita thrust an extra roll of crepe into Ileana's bag. \"For luck,\" she said, as if luck were a material you could lay by, if you were sensible enough to carry the right bag.\n\nBack in the courtyard, they cut the stakes, and Marius hammered them into the dirt as if killing something invisible. He sweat, but he didn't remove the jacket. He had a scar on his wrist that looked like river-lace. She wanted to ask him where it came from, but she also wanted to keep living in a place where not everything had to be answered at once. Instead she handed him slices of bread with olive paste that she had made at midnight with a spoon and a small sort of fury.\n\n\"My father said paper flowers were for girls who cried too much,\" she said, as if she were commenting on weather. \"I think maybe I am done taking orders from ghosts.\"\n\n\"You could be careful,\" he said, turning his face upward to judge the way the wind recorded itself in the pine tips. \"People like to run their mouths. They can be\u2026 It is not only laughter. It can cut. You pretend not to bleed and then at night. And then at night.\"\n\n\"And then?\" she asked, and he shook his head, finished his slice, put the plate on the bench, and something in him closed like the shed door, tidy, final.\n\nThat evening the building association had one of its meetings in the ground-floor hallway, which smelled of damp and a neighbor's onion soup. C\u0103t\u0103lin, who had moved in three months ago with a white toothbrush and a plan to buy the whole block if his imagination allowed, brought printouts with colored graphs. He wanted to cut down the courtyard trees because \"roots are disruptive\" and because \"shade makes mold.\" He wanted to pave. He wanted to add parking. He wanted, mostly, to see himself reflected in a glazed surface.\n\n\"Do we want more dust?\" Ileana said, surprising herself with the force of her voice. \"More heat? We already breath in cement. I like to see birds that are not pigeons. Is that so frivolous? Are we\u2014\"\n\n\"Ah,\" C\u0103t\u0103lin said, in the tone that had prompted boys to fight him in school but which his shoulders had allowed him to avoid, \"the lady with the... the craft. How sweet. Perhaps we could hang your paper bouquets from the lampposts in the new parking lot. Artisanal.\"\n\n\"Or we could plant geraniums,\" she said. \"Those red ones you like when it is the election.\" Laughter tipped toward her, then away when his face soured. People were cowards; she didn't blame them. Their mortgages were knives they kept in their pockets.\n\nMarius stood at the edge of the gathering, his hands behind his back, his chin tilted in a way that wasn't quite defiant. He did not speak. He did not have to; he had a way of standing that made lawyers and men like C\u0103t\u0103lin push their voices harder, as if they must make something happen to justify themselves. In the end, they voted to do nothing, to \"revisit in six months\" which was to say, to let time decide or to let something quieter find them. It fascinated her\u2014that sometimes the bravest action was to refuse action, to sit in the weeds with your throat quiet and your hands closed around a thing you did not want to relinquish.\n\nAfterwards, she found him at the gate, fitting a piece of rubber into the hinge so the moan softened. \"You did not speak,\" she said.\n\n\"I am the gardener,\" he said. It was the first time she had heard him call himself that. \"They think my vote is leaves. I save my speech for other uses.\"\n\n\"What uses?\"\n\n\"For the day when someone wants to hurt something I can put my body in front of,\" he said, still in that flat tone, and for the first time since she'd known him, a glint of steel showed under the dirt. It frightened and thrilled her to see it.\n\nThe next weeks slipped, but not away. Mara came in with allergies and left with a bouquet that made her sneeze less. \"It's like it scares the pollen,\" she said, amazed. Anca sent a photo of her daughter holding the red rose like a microphone. Luminita introduced a new student at class, a man with hands that shook and eyes that had seen too many dawns.\n\n\"People laugh at you?\" he asked Ileana, when she offered him the green tape like communion.\n\n\"They have always laughed at me,\" she said, smiling, \"for one reason or another. I am a factory of reasons.\"\n\n\"Then we are three,\" he said, and pointed to himself, to the paper in his hand, to the evening spread flat outside the window like a sheet. They bent their heads together over a center of wire and glue and breath.\n\nHer mother phoned again on a Sunday when television shows hurt the air. \"Your cousin Costel says he saw you at the market,\" she announced, as if presenting a nurse with a fever chart. \"He says you were buying carnival supplies. Are you having midlife crisis?\"\n\n\"I am having my life,\" Ileana said, washing strawberries one by one. \"Mami. I am having it.\"\n\n\"What if you get a virus from those papers? They come from somewhere dirty. China. I'm joking, don't start. Listen. The neighbor's daughter. Marble. It's... no, I will not go into it again. Listen, they put sugar in everything, what do I know.\"\n\n\"I'm practicing being wrong,\" Ileana said, lightly now. \"It warms me at night.\"\n\n\"You joke too much,\" her mother sighed. \"Make the sign of the cross. Say a psalm. Be serious one day.\"\n\nWhen they met, Sorin tried to charm her out of the mood she had set like a table. He failed, because she did not reciprocate, and charm needs a second to matter. In the end, there was a document. There was the signature he thought she would not be brave enough to ask for. There was the way the air in the cafe felt different after it was done\u2014thinner, full of particles, as if she could hear her own lungs. She hid in the bathroom for a minute, two, because she had trained herself to leave rooms before she cried. She didn't. She splashed water on her face like every actress in a show, and then she laughed at herself there, in the tarnished mirror.\n\nWhen she came out the day's light had turned gold like a trinket. She walked home the long way, past an old apothecary with green-painted shelves and brown bottles with Latin names that pretended they knew more than they did. The woman behind the counter scowled. \"We close in five,\" she said. \"If you want something, be quick.\"\n\n\"I don't know what I want,\" Ileana said honestly, as if the apothecary could spare the time to solve more than a headache.\n\n\"Then you're not buying,\" the woman said, but her mouth's corner betrayed her, a small kindness. \"Try tomorrow. At least bring me a problem to solve. I hate tourists.\"\n\nShe went to sleep with the crepe paper folded at the foot of her bed like extra sheets. It softened the night. She dreamed a tree with white birds sitting where the leaves would be, and in the dream she could not tell if the birds were alive or made of paper, and it didn't matter because the tree hummed as if it wanted for nothing.\n\nIn the dark morning the air felt wrong. She knew it as she poured coffee. The trams sounded louder. The neighbor's dog didn't bark. Even the rosemary did not look pleated with life. On the stairs on her way down she met an older woman she had never seen in her life; the woman wore a sweater buttoned in the wrong order and gave Ileana the solemn nod you might give someone in a waiting room.\n\nAt the bottom of the stairs, the courtyard was empty in a way that emptied her. The gate was ajar, but not for air. The radio was on but low, as if someone had placed a hand over its mouth. And there was Marius, sitting on the bench, both hands on his knees like a man waiting for judgment. The stray dog lay under his feet, eyes on him, a guard who didn't know what to guard.\n\n\"What?\" Ileana said, not whispering because whispering would make it too real. \"Is something wrong? Are you\u2014\" She stopped. The air was wrong because something had happened. It hadn't happened to her. It was in the smell of condensing breath above dirt. It was in the way the buildings seemed to lean.\n\nMarius looked up at her, and for once his face showed something and did not hide it fast enough. He looked like a man who had done something that could not be undone. He looked like the hinge of the gate, metal cracking around a hole, not yet broken, giving.\n\n\"Later,\" he said, and she heard the word fold as if loaded with wet. \"Later I will ask you if you can make something white.\"\n\nShe sat beside him without touching. The dog put its chin on her shoe and exhaled as if explaining something to her patiently, in a language she should have known. The old radio murmured to itself. The plants were just plants. They stood. They did not know that anything had changed. That was the cruelty and the blessing.\n\n\"I have a class,\" she said, to say anything.\n\n\"You're learning to make petals,\" he said. There was nothing mocking in it. \"Good. Learn.\"\n\nShe sat with him until the concierge began to rattle keys and unlock doors and the city's noise slipped back into place like a coin into a slot. She went upstairs and washed her hands twice, as if guilt were a smell. She returned to the table and looked at the red rose in the jar, which had started to lean like an old man. She took it out and rewrapped the base with stronger tape, then made a note in a small notebook: better wire. She wrote it three times, as if the insistence could keep anything upright that wanted very much to fall.\n\nWhen she finally went to class, late, Luminita looked at her with that slow, telling gaze that had undone her at Obor. \"We make white today,\" she said, simply, and started to teach them the kind of flowers you took into quiet places where people sat with their hands between their knees and listened to the air working hard.\n\nOn the way home, she walked past the apothecary, and this time she went in. The woman behind the counter recognized her enough to soften. \"Today?\" she said.\n\n\"Today I bring a problem,\" Ileana said. \"I don't know if it can be solved with anything you have. But I want to learn names. Of herbs. Of drops. Of anything that helps. Even if it is only a story. I can pay for good stories.\"\n\n\"Sometimes stories are the only things we have to fill our bottles,\" the woman said, reaching for a ledger. \"Start with chamomile. For sleep. For the first night after. Then we talk again.\"\n\nThat night, she put the chamomile under her tongue as if it were a truth. She sat with her scissors threatening silence. She finished three white carnations that were not perfect and looked exactly like the thing she could offer. And the next morning, when she went down, Marius had not slept. He was there, his cap on the bench beside him, the dog under the bench, the gate's hinge quiet. He looked at the white flowers as if they were offering him a kind of grammar. He did not ask questions. She did not tell him a thing. There were other voices for that. But when he stood, the weight he carried made sense in the way that gravity makes sense: not fair, not kind, only true.\n\n\"You have good hands,\" he said, unpracticed gratitude. \"They make order out of\u2014\"\n\n\"Paper,\" she said. \"I make order out of paper.\"\n\n\"It is more than paper,\" he said, and then looked past her, toward the street, toward a siren that had decided to hesitate at the corner, as if waiting for permission, and toward a morning that had already started to break over its own bleeding edge.The day after the siren stalled at the corner, the D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba tried on a brightness it couldn't keep. The wind prodded bits of ash off the water, and a plastic bottle moved like a small, stubborn animal. Ileana watched the river while coffee sought its level in the mug. She thought of how, as a child, she had believed the river was a ribbon that someone might pick up and shake to get the city to behave. The thought made her smile in that dry, private way she had when she wanted to test herself for softness. She took her notebook and wrote a list of things that might be needed when someone died, surprising herself with the neatness of her handwriting: candles, sugar cubes, plastic cups, napkins, coffee, coliv\u0103, towels, black scarves, paper icons, matches. She added to the list: white. She closed the notebook and felt, in her capable way, that making a list was a small way of putting a sheet over something you didn't yet have the strength to look at.\n\nWhen she reached the courtyard, the bench held the shape of someone who'd sat a long time and gotten up carefully. The stray dog had claimed the sliver of sun on the concrete and was playing at sleep, one ear cocked like a radio antenna. The gate's hinge had been tamed to a purr. Marius was not there, but the hose lay rolled with military attention, and a plastic bag of bread heels hung from the nail where he left things for the pigeons when he didn't feel like tolerating their greed. On the noticeboard where the association posted its threats about overdue fees, someone had pinned a black ribbon under a handwritten name: Maria G. No dates. People were always stingy with the dates, as if the numbers would make the loss expire faster. Ileana stood with her hands flat on the cool mailbox metal. She whispered, because there was no one to overhear and because saying a thing out loud sometimes lodged it properly in the throat: Dumnezeu s-o ierte.\n\nShe meant to go upstairs and sit on her hands until they admitted what they wanted to do, but instead she found her feet performing a memory she didn't know she had. She walked to the apothecary with the mean-faced woman and bought a stack of beeswax candles that smelled faintly of smoked apples. She went to the supermarket and bought bad coffee that made better coffee taste like mercy, sugar by the kilo, napkins with flowers printed in a red too cheerful for the occasion. She texted Luminita: need white, many, quickly, can we do pom? Luminita wrote back: come, I have wire and patience. She texted Marius with her usual reluctance to cross a line. He answered nothing and then a single word: later. The word had become a bridge; she didn't mind crossing it without knowing what stood on the other side.\n\nAt the market, Luminita had set her table differently, a small act that made the regulars glance and then look away. The reds and ultraviolet candies of last week were gone, replaced with creams and whites and the faint powder blue that old grievers liked, because they remembered the glaze of the Madonna in their grandmother's kitchen. Luminita had brought in her daughter-in-law to help, a woman with a braid like a thick rope who laughed under her breath when the taxi drivers made jokes that were so tired even the pigeons didn't bother to turn their heads. They cut circles and ovals, they tore strips, they stamped fringes so fine they whispered. Ileana's hands remembered to breathe before she did. The paper lifted under her thumbs as if it wanted to become what she wanted. It felt indecent, to be given so much obedience by a flat thing.\n\n\"You have mother's hands today,\" Luminita observed without sentiment, as if she were remarking on the weather. \"Not in the sense of babies. In the sense of care. Put that into the wire. It holds.\"\n\n\"His mother,\" Ileana said, to see what the words did out in the air. \"I met her without meeting.\"\n\n\"She liked to watch the pigeons chew without swallowing,\" Luminita said. \"She said, see, even birds get drunk on plenty. She faked a limp one year to get out of going to some cousin's wedding in Pantelimon. She hated the way people looked at her pain like it was an anecdote. I liked her. I told her finally that the limp was an absurdity. She said, I know, but it helps me gods and neighbors equally. Hold the tape closer. Your stems are loose.\"\n\nThey worked without explaining to anyone else what they were doing. They made lilies that looked less like lilies and more like the idea that lilies wanted to preserve of themselves. They made crepe bells that would clink with the slightest wind. The pom they began to build was a small tree of wire and decency; it would be dressed with apples polished until they wore the faces of ten people; it would hold pretzels threaded with red string, money pinned in the old-fashioned way to paper leaves with the heads of dead kings looking off into a better distance. Ileana had a superstition about doing things right when it mattered; she imagined ghosts took notes the way professors did, head tilted, pencil held lightly, patient with you up to a point and then not patient at all.\n\nWhen she carried the first armful of white through the courtyard, the dog got up and followed her like a senior usher. Men she had only ever known as men with cigarettes and pilled sweaters came forward to take the bags without cheerful talk. In the stairwell, someone had scrubbed the graffiti off the landing without any announcement or threat against future graffiti; it shone, for once, like a clean thought. The elevator had an out-of-order sign in handwriting that looked like a child's, and beneath it someone had drawn a cross with equal arms, as if God could be balanced by care.\n\nThe apartment where death had arrived wore no special costume. It smelled of boiled potatoes and ironed shirts. The curtains were pulled halfway, as if compromise could still be brokered with light. In the front room, the table kidneyed against a wall held the framed photograph that would stand in for a presence that had gone elsewhere. A young woman in a summer dress, a boy next to her making a serious face like men do when they think a camera is also a question. Ears that were not shy about themselves, a mouth that had decided early to be kind and had suffered for it in the small ways only kindness measures.\n\nMarius was taller in that room. Grief steels a spine in a way that makes it look like someone else's. He nodded at her, and the gesture gave her permission to move. She unwrapped the flowers, counting without thinking\u2014twelve, twenty, thirty\u2014and set them in the places where, by custom, roses might have gone if money had wanted to brag. An auntly neighbor crossed herself and said, softly, \"Paper? Eh, well. Better than nothing.\" Another woman, toes in folded sandals, touched one of the white bells the way you test a bruise. \"They keep,\" she said, and then looked embarrassed to have said it like a compliment.\n\nWhen they brought in the pom and dressed it with apples and small packages of biscuits and sugar, someone began to tell stories. It begins like that in rooms where the Christian calendar bends the day into meaning even when the city outside refuses to. A man tried to make a joke and failed and then cried into his fist, ashamed of the water. The priest came and went, leaving the smell of wax and a corridor of words through which the neighbors moved, order restored by syllables no one pretended to fully understand. Ileana found herself pouring coffee like a waitress, counting cups, rolling sugar between her fingers to keep from wringing her hands. Her own mother would have approved of her competence and scolded her for her pride in it.\n\nMarius did not speak until late, when the room had settled into the murmur of women who were not done saying what needed to be said and men who had run out of acceptable places to put their hands. He stood next to the pom as if it had become a close friend. He touched a paper petal and made no show of it. \"She liked white,\" he said, as if to the tree. \"She kept a tablecloth folded under the other tablecloths, for when the right guest came. She said maybe no one is the right guest, but perhaps the impulse is enough. \u015ei cu asta\u2026 That\u2019s life.\" He looked at the photograph and did not look back for a while.\n\nIleana edged closer only to ask, quietly, whether he wanted her to take the pom to the cemetery or leave it for the forty days, a question she only knew to ask because she had sat in rooms with her grandmother when someone went and a pine plank made the table longer. He glanced at her mouth, not her eyes, and said, \"Forty. Children will come. Good. Let them pull. Let them learn to want with their hands. The apples we give away. The paper we can keep. The dog will eat the pretzels if we leave him alone five minutes.\"\n\nAfter the neighbors drifted and the last ring of coffee cups clinked into the sink, she went home and slept with the smell of candles in her hair. She dreamed of a white room with a window that looked not over the city but over a field where wind kept turning the tall grass like a great hand. In the morning her nose stung as if she had cried, though she was not entirely sure she had. She made a list of tasks that had nothing to do with death, because life required that you give it equal time even when it was rude.\n\nAt the office, Mara had lined up invoices with the efficiency of a bored cat arranging trophies. \"We have Belgium back,\" she announced as if returning a loaned coat. \"Poland sent them shoes that were left-right-left. Also, Sorin wrote three emails in a row with the words 'final offer' in them. I ignored the first two. The third came with a smiley face, so I wrote a paragraph about compliance and attached a photo of a baby goat. He hasn't answered.\"\n\n\"I signed,\" Ileana said, and the word went out into the room like a bird that wasn't sure it wanted to leave. \"This week. It's done.\"\n\nMara blinked and then whistled; her respect had always presented itself as irony, but now something else stood behind it, a steadiness that she rarely showed. \"So it's you alone. Congratulations or condolences?\"\n\n\"Both,\" Ileana admitted. \"We owe less than we fear and more than we like. But if I fail, it will be mine. I think I wanted that. I think I was tired of being asked to arrange myself around another person's idea of profit.\"\n\n\"Look at you,\" Mara said, tipping her chin toward the jar on the shelf, where two white bells had migrated overnight as if the flowers traveled in sleep. \"With your crafts and your kingdom. Try not to pay salaries with peonies.\"\n\n\"I can pay salaries with the things peonies taught me,\" Ileana said, surprising herself. She sat and wrote three emails that would either save the month or burden it. Then she opened the spreadsheet with the column that always made her stomach climb her spine, and she looked at it until the numbers behaved.\n\nOn a slow afternoon, when the city dozed in its own heat and the office fan hummed like a plain song, she walked back to the apothecary. The woman behind the counter wore a new blouse with daisies embroidered at the neck; the daisies were uneven, which made Ileana like them more. \"Today,\" the woman said, before being asked, \"you need linden. And a small bottle of valerian if you are not offended by the smell of old socks. It helps when sleep curls under the bed and refuses to come out.\"\n\n\"I am learning to name things,\" Ileana said. \"Chamomile. Tei. Sun\u0103toare. I want to be careful, not become one of those women who sprinkle drops and think it absolves them of kindness. I want to know what is story and what is sap.\"\n\nThe woman snorted, amused. \"You are a rare bird. Most people come here to buy a license for their panic. They want religion in vials. I can provide tea and a scolding. The rest is between you and your breath.\"\n\n\"Do you ever sell the little white pills?\" Ileana asked, and braced, not for the answer but for the argument.\n\n\"I sell anything that won't harm and might persuade,\" the woman said with a weary pragmatism that Ileana admired. \"If a man sleeps because he believes in sugar with a job, I will not wake him to instruct him. Bring me your problems with borders. The ones with no edges are for another shop. Or for the priest. Or for your paper.\"\n\nThe days filled with the kind of work that, if written on a calendar, looked like a list of small defeats and small mercies. She learned to nod differently when clients threatened to leave; the nod said, that is your choice, and also, I am not terrified of it. She rewrote a contract to fit the truth rather than the hope. She calculated how many bouquets of paper peonies would equal one container's profit and then laughed at herself for the stupidity of the math and then recalculated because sometimes foolish exercises teach you where your stubbornness hides. She took three orders for corporate gifts; a law firm wanted white lilies for their conference room, because irony entertained them; a nursing home wanted pink carnations, because the residents had opinions about roses that went back to a summer in '78 and who was worthy of them; a wedding planner called to tell her paper was out and plastic in, and Ileana said \"no thank you\" and hung up with a satisfaction she hadn't known two months ago she could afford.\n\nMarius began to appear at the edges of her days like a drawing that water hadn't washed away. He raked the courtyard with a meticulousness that turned the long strips of fallen plane-tree bark into sentences. He replaced the hinges on the shed door and sanded them lightly, the sound like a cricket that had finally learned to speak softly. He asked her twice to show him how to twist the wire for a certain kind of petal, then left without a word when she fumbled and laughed at herself. He leaned against the gate one late afternoon and told her, in his flat voice that made all experiences sound equal, that the priest had gotten the story of his mother's birthdate wrong twice and that the knitted socks had been too tight on her feet in the casket, and that he had loosened them and felt a shame he did not recognize. Ileana listened the way she had listened to her grandmother when the stories were in danger of ending not with a moral but with a mistake. She did not apologize for the universe. She offered him a piece of sugar and watched him put it in his mouth as if it were medicine.\n\nThe building association, terrified of the momentum created by small groups of people who had felt something together, called another meeting. C\u0103t\u0103lin came with a new stack of proposals: a painting of a parking lot so sleek it looked like a bathroom. He had switched products on them and now sold efficiency dressed as progress. \"Trees,\" he said, with the patronizing tone he believed made him intelligible, \"harbor insects. Children are bitten. People have allergies. We have to consider the quality of life.\"\n\n\"You don't get to define life for us,\" an old woman said from the back, and the voice was so fierce that everyone turned. She was bent, a little, like someone's prized birch. Her hair was the white of a noise that makes you fall asleep. \"I have lived with insects and without. I prefer with. At least they mind their business.\"\n\n\"I can find a compromise,\" Ileana said, because she had not let go of the idea that a clever document might save a tree. \"We can cut what is sick. We can plant under the windows that have mold. We can\u2026\" She saw Marius watching the top of the nearest pine as if it were a radio station in a storm. She saw him not speaking because he was saving the words for when the words had the right value.\n\n\"We can wait,\" Marius said, finally. He did not raise his voice. He did not move. \"Wind comes. It tells you which branches want to break. We cut those, and only those. You do not pave over wind. It refuses. It comes back through the cracks.\"\n\nThe silence that followed sounded, in Ileana's ear, like a kennel full of dogs who had decided to obey. They voted, again, to revisit, again, which meant some trees would live by default. It was not victory. It was, in its way, better\u2014life persisting through neglect as it always had in cities where people had more pressing things to break.\n\nOn a Saturday when the clouds lay like a stubborn duvet and the D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba had exactly the right amount of shine, she met Luminita and two women from the class in the community room and tried something new. Not only flowers. Birds. They cut paper so thin it was like the skin that forms on milk left too long on stovetops. They folded wings and creased beaks and made eyes with the blunt end of a toothpick. In her hand a white bird became a place where you might hang a wish without making a fool of yourself. They strung them with invisible thread, and for an hour the room looked like a chapel of truce.\n\n\"These,\" Luminita said, tying a knot so expertly that it disappeared, \"people will call ridiculous. Then they will ask for ten. Then they will pretend they invented them. That's the progression. Try to be amused.\"\n\n\"I was born amused,\" Ileana said. \"And tired of my own amusement. I want to see if I can ride it like a horse instead of being dragged by it. Does that make sense? No. Ignore me. Tell me which scissors cut without tearing.\"\n\n\"Those,\" Luminita said, pointing, and then, after a pause, \"and also the ones you keep hidden for your own work. You are ready to keep some things.\"\n\nThe apothecary woman, whose name Ileana still hadn't earned, caught her on the way home and thrust a small jar into her hands. \"Honey with propolis,\" she said, forestalling argument. \"For the old ones with coughs that don't intend to leave until the first snow surprises them. Give it to the man with the cap. He pretends he won't accept charity. You do not offer charity. You offer a trade. He gives you stories for your bottles.\"\n\n\"I can pay\u2014\" Ileana began, and the woman shook her head in a way that looked practiced for decades.\n\n\"You will,\" she said. \"By coming back and buying something you do not need, which is the definition of culture. Enough talk. The city is listening.\"\n\nThat evening, Marius stood with his hands in his jacket pockets and looked at the sky as if it were someone speaking a dialect he had only recently learned to love. She handed him the jar and told him there was medicine in it and also bees. He smiled with the edges of his mouth and no one else would have noticed. \"My mother,\" he said, \"used to give me honey in tea and call it a contract. If I drank, I had to sleep. If I slept, I had to be good the next day. If I was good, she would forget to pick up the belt. I will honor old contracts.\"\n\nThey sat on the bench while the dog attempted to dig a hole in a piece of ground that had no interest in being excavated. A woman in a velvet tracksuit walked by with a bouquet of supermarket chrysanthemums and said, with an odd generosity that carried no request inside it, \"Beautiful. Paper?\" Ileana said yes and did not explain herself, and the woman nodded as if it were as reasonable to make flowers as to wear velvet in June. Far away, a kid kicked a ball against a wall and learned something about force and the limits of it. Somewhere closer, someone practiced a trumpet badly and then correctly and then badly again, and the sound leapt across the air like a bright fish.\n\nSunday came with the taste of obligation. Her mother called early. \"I heard about the mother of that man,\" she said, wasting no time on salutation. \"The one with the keys. The one who sleeps with his broom. Dumnezeu s-o ierte. Did you go? Did you bring something? Did you embarrass us?\"\n\n\"I brought coffee. Flowers. And myself,\" Ileana said, putting slices of peach into a bowl so carefully you would have thought an audience watched. \"Mami, do you ever feel like the things you make with your hands are the only honest things you do?\"\n\n\"I make sarmale,\" her mother said. \"They do not lie. They either taste good or they don't. When your father died, the priest told me to knead dough until the salt came out of my eyes. I told him I would knead his head. Then I kneaded the dough. It helped and it didn't. Life is not a recipe. Why are you asking? Are you going to start making sarmale for money? The neighbor's daughter says that is a dignified profession.\"\n\n\"I am thinking,\" Ileana said, \"of renting a small room. To hold classes. To sell what we make. To be poor in a different way.\"\n\n\"You will always be poor in one way or another,\" her mother said with that robust fatalism that had, over the years, produced both miracles and ulcers. \"Better to choose the kind of poverty that suits your face. Call me when you need money. I will say no and then I will say yes and then I will tell you a story about when flour was rationed and I wore my cousin's shoes and my toe went blue.\"\n\nAfter the call, she walked to a building three streets over, a former tailor's shop with windows that had traveled through three kinds of regime and could tell the differences if asked gently. The owner, a woman with sad eyebrows and an optimistic belt, showed her the space and waved her hand as if the air itself were rentable. \"It's damp in winter,\" she said, because she was honest to a fault. \"In summer the floor expands and pretends it's angry. The electricity is a religion we only believe in on Sundays. But look.\" She opened the back door, and a small courtyard revealed itself like a rabbit. A fig tree tried to be brave in a corner. \"The light in the morning does something to paper. I don't know if that matters to you.\"\n\n\"It does,\" Ileana said, and saw, as clearly as she had seen an invoice the week the papers finally made sense, a class of women in cheap sandals and painted nails, a man with hands that shook folding a bird crease, a child who had wandered in trailing a sugar string, a jar with a label crooked, a box under the counter where she would keep money and secrets. She did not say yes, not because she was timid but because timing mattered. She asked for three days to think, and the owner said good, because people who say yes too quickly make expensive tenants.\n\nOn Monday, the city remembered to be cruel. A truck sideswiped a motorbike on \u0218oseaua Mihai Bravu and the ambulance took longer than anyone could bear; two men nearly fought outside the bakery because one had cut the line not out of arrogance but out of an emergency of digestion; Mara cried at her desk and said it was pollen and it was not. The jar with the white bells tipped and the bells stayed together, their wire doing what it was told. At lunch, Ileana signed her name to a transfer that made her stomach cold and her palms hot. She ate bread in the car with keys in her mouth and laughed, a little mad, at the absurdity of surviving via carbohydrates.\n\nBy evening, the wind had rolled a storm in under the balcony and set it down with a thump. She took the rosemary inside and set it next to the jar of paper and thought of ships coming into ports and being told to wait until the water was in a better mood. Marius knocked on her door, an act that made the air stand up. He held his cap in both hands as if it were something that might need soothing. \"Tomorrow,\" he said, not stepping over the threshold, which thrilled and hurt her in equal measure, \"we take the pom to the church. The boys asked if they could carry. I said yes if they wash and do not spit. You come?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" she said, and then, because the whiteness of the day needed an anchor, \"I found a place. Maybe. For classes. For\u2026 something we haven't named. Will you come see?\"\n\n\"I will come stand at the door and pretend to guard,\" he said, and a corner of his mouth moved again. \"And if anyone laughs\u2026\" He didn't finish. He didn't need to.\n\nShe thought, not for the first time that week, that perhaps love, in its early, almost invisible form, took the shape of apprenticeships you didn't agree to in words. She thought, also, that numbers would save her or comfort her or at least keep her honest. She wrote a list on the back of a receipt: rent, light, tape, wire, paper, chairs, tea, cups, a kettle that didn't flip its fuse like a teenager\u2014then paused and added, in a hand that belonged to someone braver than she felt, the word enough. She pinned the receipt under a magnet that had come free in a magazine and that had long ago lost its picture but kept its hold.\n\nWhen night fell, it was the kind that came down like a curtain, fast and unapologetic. The city sighed itself to sleep in dirty fits. In the apartment beneath hers, someone sang off-key for a minute; someone laughed; someone coughed; a baby failed to be consoled and then succeeded. The paper flowers on her desk threw faint shadows that looked, if you were inclined to superstition, like the writing of a language you hadn't yet learned but might, if you sat very still, someday read.They carried the pom with the solemnity of boys pretending to be men. The youngest insisted on going in front, his hair smoothed with too much water, his shirt tucked with all the insistence of someone new to buttons; the tallest had a black ribbon pinned to his sleeve and a scab on his knee he thought no one could see. Marius walked beside them, one hand ready to catch if a wire slice wobbled, his cap tucked into the back pocket of his jacket as if he couldn\u2019t bear to cover his head today. Ileana followed with the bag of candles and the matches and the sugar, the smell of beeswax and coffee leaking from the cloth like a confession. On the corner by the kiosk the woman who sold lottery tickets made the sign of the cross without interrupting her sales pitch; the bus driver waiting at the light nodded the slow nod men have for death that doesn\u2019t belong to them but has walked their street before.\n\nThe church\u2019s courtyard was freckled with gravel that pretended to keep shoes clean and failed. A black-coated man with a face like a thumbnail took the apples from the pom and wiped them on a rag that had wiped a hundred apples before; a girl in a pink hoodie asked the priest if she could ring the bell just once and the priest, after pretending to consider, let her tug the rope with two hands. Inside, the air folded around them the way it always did, incense and damp wood and old voices arranged like chairs. Women with scarves tied in knots at the top of their heads\u2014old-fashion knots that said they did not care what magazines instructed\u2014stood with their feet slightly apart, as if bracing for a wave. The candles took light obediently, and the honeyed smoke rose in ribbons that made the saints on the wall look like the people had brought them a weather report.\n\nWhen the first prayer rose, low and droning, the boys fidgeted less. They had been instructed about biting their nails and not spitting, and they seemed glad that there was finally something for them to do that felt like a job: carry, stand straight, not drop. Marius stood close enough to the icon of the Mother that if he had leaned a fraction his cheek would have touched the frame; he did not lean. When the priest said Maria\u2019s name, they said it back in a chorus that sounded like it came from a hundred throats and also from only one, and Ileana had that moment she always had in churches, the old surprise that so many separate bodies could produce one sound as if there were agreement in the universe about anything.\n\nAfter the service, the courtyard woke into the business of grief. The coffee poured into plastic cups steamed like small grief-clouds; sugar cubes softened and broke in mouths that never mentioned sweetness on normal days. The pom stood by the gate, dressed with biscuits and coins, the paper bells pale in the bright. Children flowed around it with the instinctive respect children have for the things that might punish them; when the word came, like a small whistle of permission, they surged and plucked and fled with triumph that made the old women mutter a blessing disguised as condemnation. An old man unpinned a paper leaf and turned it in his fingers with the care he might have given to a photograph. \u201cShe would have liked this,\u201d he said to no one, and the nod that came back belonged to three people and to the pigeons who had arrived to preside.\n\nMarius took the jar of honey without theatrics. He held it in one hand and looked at it as if trying to recall where in the house he would put it so that it could be found by someone other than him. \u201cShe used to tell me the first spoon is the price you pay to be quiet,\u201d he said, and tilted the jar to watch the slow adjust. \u201cThe second spoon is for promises. The third is for lying down.\u201d He put the jar into the flat bag of grocery cloth with an efficiency that could have been mistaken for indifference. \u201cYou come tomorrow? The forty days. Don\u2019t worry, we won\u2019t make you stir the coliv\u0103. It must be someone with wrists like rope.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can wash the cups,\u201d Ileana said. \u201cI can count the candles. I can take orders without thinking I have lost something by doing what I\u2019m told.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you will be useful,\u201d he said, and for the first time that day his mouth became a smile that showed itself and did not flinch away. \u201cIt is good to be useful when the world is trying so hard not to be.\u201d\n\nBack home, she didn\u2019t go upstairs. The air under the plane trees felt like a waiting room with no clock. She sat on the bench and thought of the first time she had seen a pom, when she was five and her grandmother had insisted on pinning a coin to her dress because \u201cthe dead appreciate punctuality.\u201d The pom had been beautiful in a way that frightened her then, all that order and white in a world that was otherwise goose feathers and spilled soup. She had assumed beauty was reserved for weddings, for people who had purchased permission. To see it surround a thing that was mostly absence had made her uneasy, and that unease had, it seemed, decided to live near her bones forever. She breathed, because Luminita had taught her to breathe in the stupid moments and the sacred ones, and the breath did what it always did: insisted she belonged in her body.\n\nUpstairs, the notebook waited, and she opened it as if it might have grown teeth overnight. She wrote a list as a rehearsal in daring: call tailor\u2019s shop owner about terms; ask Mara to design a flyer and pretend not to care if she groaned; buy a kettle, even if it explodes the fuse; find secondhand chairs, not too many, not too few; ask Luminita which days she\u2019d teach if she were free of her stall in the afternoons; ask Marius if he would fix the hinge on the back door; ask the apothecary if she had a way to keep moths from eating paper that isn\u2019t poisonous or a superstition that requires a hymn. The list looked like a benevolent threat. She understood that the only way to trick fear was to keep it so busy it forgot to show its teeth.\n\nShe signed the lease on a Tuesday at a desk that had seen uniforms and ribbons and ration cards and engagement party decorations. The owner wore her sad eyebrows and the optimistic belt and accepted a lesser deposit than she\u2019d asked for without sighing. \u201cI prefer occupiers of space,\u201d she said, pushing the keys across the desk as if they were small children who must be taught to walk. \u201cEmpty rooms make a neighborhood ill. People start thinking the city is a hallway they can run down without hitting anyone. Bring tea. Put a curtain. Do not put fairy lights. My nerves cannot take them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will put a plant,\u201d Ileana promised, and felt older and sillier for making a promise about a plant. She called Marius as she walked the three streets back with the keys, and the way he answered\u2014one word\u2014felt, by now, as intimate as any endearment she had received in her life. She told him the back door swelled in the frame; he grunted, which meant he would arrive with a plane and a small song he made with the blade without knowing. She told him the floor complained when she walked; he said he would bring wedges and the patience he usually reserved for the gate.\n\nIn the shop the light did its trick, slipping across the floorboards like a visitor who had been here before and was willing to pretend surprise. The walls had been papered and then stripped and then papered again, and they held, in abstract patterns, twenty years of someone else\u2019s taste. The counter served no logical purpose yet, but she wiped it anyway, because wiping it gave it a function: to be cleaned, to receive palms, to brace a woman who might come in with a story. She stuck the kettle in the corner and ran a cord to an outlet that could not be trusted. She put the jar of honey on the shelf at eye level and permitted herself the superstition that it would sweeten something invisible.\n\nWhen Luminita came, she brought the feeling she always brought, like a procession of good ants. Her bracelets chimed against the counter; her daughter-in-law carried a box of crepe like a baby. \u201cWe start with dust,\u201d she announced cheerfully. \u201cIf you sweep before the priest comes, he scolds you for vanity. If you sweep before the city comes, it may give you a pass. Ah. Your windows will be your custom. People like to see their doubts reflected in pretty glass.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople like to see their reflections softened by something with a story,\u201d Ileana said, and Luminita looked at her and grinned, a grin that included wrinkles that deserved their own church icon. \u201cWe will make a story. We will price it in coins and patience.\u201d\n\nMara arrived late, carrying a plant she insisted was a fern and a poster she had designed on her lunch hour when she should have been filing invoices. The poster was black and white with one red flower, more motive than object, a corner accidentally torn because she had taken the tram at rush hour. \u201cIf anyone laughs at the font, we disinvite them from the human race,\u201d she said, and then, seeing the keys on the counter, softened in a way she would deny if accused. \u201cIt smells like glue and ambition. Perfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt smells like the men\u2019s barber used to smell,\u201d said an old woman who had lived on the street since long before anyone started talking about property. She leaned in the door with her shopping bag resting on her shin. \u201cLemn. Marf\u0103 bun\u0103. Good wood. I had my hair set here once, when I could afford to be frivolous and not call it therapy. Are those paper? They look like what my mother made for the icon corner. She used to pin coins at the edge and tell us not to steal them unless we had a truly good plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can come in,\u201d Ileana said, gesturing her closer. \u201cWe have no prices yet, so everything is a gift or a mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cGift,\u201d the woman said, practical, and stepped inside, rubbing one thumb over another the way people do when they\u2019re rehearsing a bill. \u201cMy niece is getting married for the second time, which is the time when people whisper louder. I intend to give her something that makes even ugly mouths close.\u201d\n\nThey worked until the walls felt less like witnesses and more like accomplices. Marius planed the door and whistled without realizing it. He put a new screw in the hinge and told her to rub soap on the edge when it swelled in rain; he wedged the floor where the boards had started to believe in their own drama. He refused a glass of tea and then accepted it without thanks in the way of men who don\u2019t know how to say yes without becoming susceptible to yes. When the first pair of teenage girls slipped in, open-mouthed and tenderly scornful of everything on principle, he pretended he had become a coat rack and let them compare strands of crepe to their nails under their breath. Young men walked by outside with the particular swagger of men who have seen something bad and decided to make it into a joke before it eats them; one stopped and said, \u201cBun\u0103, doamn\u0103, how much for that, to take to a girl who will say no?\u201d and Ileana named a price that made him blink and then grin and dig in his pocket as if the coins had decided, finally, to be brave.\n\nC\u0103t\u0103lin came, of course, as all people who imagine themselves center of a neighborhood come when they sense something is being built without their opining. He stood in the doorway with his arms crossed to reproduce the shape of a judge and said, \u201cSo. Arts and crafts. I suppose this is\u2026 charming.\u201d It was the way he stretched the last word that invited blood. Marius didn\u2019t change position. He wiped the blade of the plane as if it had been used to carve something important. \u201cWe\u2019re building a place where people can hold something in their hands and not harm themselves,\u201d he said, and the simplicity of the sentence did what long arguments couldn\u2019t. C\u0103t\u0103lin shrugged, made a comment about parking, and retreated into the world where he did not have to invent new ways to respect the work of others.\n\nThe first class in the new space was full because there are, always, people hungry for the kind of attention that has nothing to do with pity. A nurse came who had been told by her supervisor that her empathy was causing delays; a woman whose daughter had just emigrated to Germany and who wanted to make something that didn\u2019t require visas; a boy with a shaved head and a scar near his ear who said his aunt had sent him and who spent the first ten minutes scoffing and the next forty watching his own hands with interest he tried to convert into disdain and failed; the man with the tremor returned and took his place in the corner by the window and whispered, as if to the scissors, \u201cNu te gr\u0103bi. Don\u2019t rush.\u201d They cut petals for chrysanthemums, the flower the city had decided could be all purposes if you were clever enough. Luminita made rounds like a ship\u2019s captain; Ileana moved from hand to hand with tape and encouragement and the particular delight that comes from seeing a woman lift her head as if air has improved.\n\nIn between teaching and taping, in the hours where no one watched over her shoulder, Ileana ran numbers with the same reverence she ran her fingers over the good crepe. Rent and light and tape went into columns that did not shiver; the frog-march of expenses lined up; profit failed to appear in the cheeks as often as she liked, but it arrived in places she had not thought to count: in the woman who ignored the pain in her wrist for fifteen minutes because her flower needed one more turn; in the boy who carried a bouquet to the tram with the seriousness of a man who has decided to choose something for his life and is going to defend it; in the old woman who brought a jar of pickles and announced that everything good begins with vinegar and sugar in equal amounts. Mara stuck a small box by the door for contributions and closed her eyes when people dropped coins in it, because she believed money made fools of the generous and the desperate equally.\n\nThe apothecary woman came one afternoon wearing a cardigan that had seen three wars and a pair of shoes that promised nothing. She stood with her hands in the safe place that is the waistband of a skirt and watched without granting approval. When they paused, she said, \u201cI am Viorica. If you insist on calling me doamn\u0103, I will throw this jar of cucumber water at your feet and make you clean it.\u201d The naming felt like a benediction and a dare. She set a small bottle on the counter\u2014the kind with the dropper\u2014and said, \u201cNot homeopathy. Tincture. Real plant. Real burn. For the women whose sleep is not where they left it. I will charge you enough to respect it and not enough to resent me. And when the stubborn ones come\u2014there are always stubborn ones who think will is stronger than chemistry\u2014you send them to me and I will insult them into drinking tea.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeal,\u201d Ileana said, glad to be instructed. \u201cAnd for moths?\u201d\n\n\u201cLavender,\u201d Viorica said, rolling her eyes at the banality of it. \u201cAnd cedar shavings. And a story stuck under the paper about a woman who kept a dress for twenty years because she thought she would be thin again and then wore it to visit the doctor who told her that thinness is a religion invented by people who don\u2019t have to lift sacks of potatoes. Moths appreciate irony. They will go eat someone\u2019s winter sofa instead.\u201d\n\nWhen the storm finally did what it had been rattling its chains to do for days, it threw a branch from the plane tree down like a sentence. The crack woke the courtyard. C\u0103t\u0103lin took the branch in hand like an exhibit and said, \u201cSee? Danger. Lawsuit.\u201d Ileana was at the sink, rinsing glue from her fingers, and when she came out, the courtyard had the particular charge it gets when men are ready to speak the way they think men should speak. Marius stood with his hand on the trunk, palm flat, like a doctor listening to a heart. \u201cOnly this one,\u201d he said, tapping a higher branch with the metal tip of his broom as if the broom were a scalpel. \u201cAnd the one behind it. The wind says these are bouncers. The rest can stand. They know how to bow.\u201d He had a rope over his shoulder, a rope that had hauled fridges and sofas and once, he\u2019d told her, a goat that had refused to negotiate with gravity.\n\n\u201cCall a company,\u201d C\u0103t\u0103lin demanded, waving his printed estimate like a flag. \u201cProfessionals. Insurance. Receipts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a profession,\u201d Marius said, tying the rope around the trunk without looking. \u201cThe wind and I will sign your receipt.\u201d The little boys clustered, lip-chewing, feigning boredom with their hands in their pockets. Ileana had already grabbed the extra coil and fed him slack as he climbed, the rope braced across her waist, her heels dug into the courtyard\u2019s reliable grit. The dog lay down with his nose on his paws, every nerve taut and pretending not to be. The climb was slow, the small movements of a man who had learned that heroism is another word for foolishness if you don\u2019t watch the hinge. He looped the rope and cut with a saw that looked too modest to win and coaxed the branch down in a patient arc so that it landed as if choosing to lie. The second branch came easier; the third, once he was up there, Marius cut because it whispered so obviously of future disaster even C\u0103t\u0103lin quieted. When he came down he sat on the trunk as if on an old friend and breathed as if he\u2019d been holding the breath for an hour, which he had.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to get yourself killed,\u201d Mara said from the doorway of the shop, though her hands shook in the way of admiration looked at sideways. \u201cAnd then who will I mock when my jokes land and need a soft place?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne day,\u201d he said, wiping a scuffed hand across his face, leaving a clean print in the dust, \u201cwe will all be this tree. Someone will decide we are good for shade and also for accidents. If we are lucky, a person who listens to wind will make the call.\u201d He nodded at Ileana, formal as if they were exchanging a medal. \u201cYou held well.\u201d\n\n\u201cI count for a living,\u201d she said. \u201cI can count rope.\u201d\n\nHer mother came to the shop two weeks later, with the gait of a person who had resisted and then, against her own doctrine, given in. She wore her good coat because she did not believe in mixing sorrows and pleasures, and because if anyone photographed her she wanted to be able to show that she had always been dignified. She walked around like a border guard and then took a seat without permission at the corner table, where the papers slid into her possession. \u201cHm,\u201d she said, about everything that might have elicited delight or disdain. \u201cAt least it is clean. At least you are not selling cigarettes to children. At least I can tell people you opened something and they will not imagine a mistake with a man.\u201d\n\n\u201cMami,\u201d Ileana said, cutting a strip and then handing the scissors over, not because her mother had asked but because leaving her hands empty seemed unreasonable, \u201cdo you want to try?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not twelve,\u201d her mother said, and then, two minutes later, holding a petal that had the shape of her own mouth, \u201cHow much do you charge for this? Huh. Too little. People think things are cheap when they are cheap. You must charge enough that they feel they have been forgiven for not doing it themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you approve?\u201d Ileana asked, not because she needed permission but because the old instinct has a long leash. Her mother pursed her lips like a woman swallowing vinegar in order to feel superior to those who use sugar. \u201cI approve of a woman who doesn\u2019t wait for a man to bring her a violet,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you marry a fool, at least when he leaves you will have a room with keys. Did you put rosemary at the door? My mother did. It keeps thieves and melancholy away in equal measure.\u201d\n\n\u201cI put rosemary everywhere,\u201d Ileana said, and when her mother turned the petal between fingers thickened by decades of dough and buckets and lifting another life\u2019s weight, something in the air settled as if furniture had been moved and finally found its right place.\n\nTheft came anyway, because the city cannot resist a window. Two days after the class where they had learned to fold birds until the air looked like it believed in itself, a bouquet disappeared from the front display while she unwrapped a delivery in the back and Luminita was explaining to a man that no, his wife would not like orange lilies if she had said she did not. Ileana stood with the absence in her hand and felt, not anger, but a rush of pride that embarrassed her. \u201cSomeone chose us,\u201d she said, and Marius, adjusting the sign that squeaked when the chock moved, nodded as if he had been waiting for her to understand the law of small losses.\n\n\u201cPeople steal what whispers to them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t bother with things that shout.\u201d He looked toward the street where a woman in a blue dress with a fraying hem walked by, the bouquet tucked under her elbow like a loaf. \u201cMaybe she is going to make trouble and needs courage. Maybe she saw her own hunger in your window and preferred to put it under her arm than admit it. If you like, I will pretend to chase her and scare her into buying two next time.\u201d\n\n\u201cPretend,\u201d Ileana said, laughing into the tightness in her chest. \u201cI do not want paperwork.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the month, the shop looked as if it had always been itself. The good scissors had found their place under an old tin with a picture of peaches that were more fanciful than peaches ever are; the kettle had learned not to sulk when asked to boil; the corner where the floor pitched had become the province of children who preferred to sit on a cushion and cut badly until suddenly they cut well; the shelf near the window held bottles with labels written by a woman with handwriting that could convince goats to behave. People came and stayed beyond the time rational people allot for errands. They told Luminita about their exes. They told Viorica about their kidneys. They told Marius about their gates. They told Ileana about their daughters and their sons and their desire to stay in a city that had always made leaving sound so reasonable.\n\nOne evening, as the light made its little play on the wall, she counted taxis at the crosswalk not because the numbers would save her but because they were another way to keep time that didn\u2019t involve waiting for emails. Seven stopped. Twelve did not. A man ran, his bag slapping his thigh, and made it, and lifted his hand to the driver as if to say, you saved my life. A woman refused to run, stood, let her hair lift in the small wind the cars made, and when a taxi did stop she shook her head, refusing the victory, and a small boy laughed, the delighted laugh of someone who has not yet learned that refusal is an art. She turned back to the table and pressed the edges of a peony between her fingers and knew, with the calm that arrives like a sleep when you stop insisting on it, that she had made a home out of paper that would not betray her as quickly as people did.\n\nAt night, when she closed the shutters and pushed the bolt and left the room to the dust that performs its slow arithmetic without witnesses, she walked home the long way, along the D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba that had decided, this late, to reflect faithfully. The river held, in streaks, the streetlamps and the absurd glow of a billboard promising eternal youth if you are willing to pay enough and a neon cross that blinked as if God had a sense of humor. She thought of the first time she had inhaled the smell of crepe dye and dust and felt something rearrange inside her like furniture moved in heavy rain. She thought of Marius\u2019s mother, who would have laughed at the honey and told her not to forget to buy matches in case the electricity remembered its grudges. She thought of the way the boys had held the pom as if it were a person who needed convincing. She thought of Sorin, whose cologne had finally left the room, and of the way signing a name can feel like either murder or baptism depending on the ink. She thought of lists and felt no itch to write one.\n\nAt the bench, the stray dog lifted his head and watched her pass as if she were the moon and he didn\u2019t want to miss the only show he could afford. The gate breathed when she opened it, no longer moaning, only informing the air. In the stairwell, someone had hung a sprig of basil because the neighbor\u2019s baby had cut a tooth, and the smell felt like medicine trying to pretend it was celebration. On her table, the white birds hung from a wire like a small weather. They cast shadows that were not words yet and that might not become words and that, even so, taught her the patience to wait for a language that would take her, when it was ready, into its mouth.By the time the ginkgo leaves remembered yellow, the D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba had a way of refusing to commit to any one temperament. It woke cold, chiseled by a breeze that smelled of rust and walnuts, then flared to life at noon when light poured itself in like uninvited relatives, and by dusk it had the sullenness of a child denied a fairground ride. Ileana watched it while counting taxis with the same cool attention she gave the spreadsheet column that always tried to frighten her. Four stopped; eight did not; one slid past, saw his own face in the glass of a storefront, and reversed sheepishly as if to apologize to his better nature. She sipped coffee and thought that perhaps it was good training, to keep track of small compliance in a city that rarely offered any, and then she put the mug down and made her morning list longer than it needed to be because she had learned that some days only obeyed if you gave them too many instructions.\n\nThe shop had learned its sounds. The front bell clicked instead of ringing, a modest scrape that let her keep talking without apologizing to the air; the kettle took three tries unless you muttered at it; the scissors made two notes, one when they opened and one when they submitted to what paper wanted, and there were customers who had begun to come not only for flowers but also for that music. On a Tuesday that was bright like clean plates, a woman wearing a hospital badge came in with her shoulders squared in a way that meant she believed in her work and had an equal affection for protocols. She looked at the white lilies with a face trained not to show longing and asked, nothing apologetic in it, whether paper made people feel foolish, because she wanted to put something in rooms where flowers made sick men sneeze and where daughters needed to know that beauty could be permitted to linger.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t die,\u201d Ileana said, hating the sentence as soon as she heard it, because nothing that mattered had the decency to obey that particular law. She softened it with her hands. \u201cThey hold their shape when you ask them to. We can make them wrong on purpose, so they look less like the thing that makes people think of funerals. We can make them brazen. We can make birds, if birds feel easier. Tell me your rooms. I can picture them better if I know which window catches for no good reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe palliative ward,\u201d the woman said, and then, because naming it out loud deserved a counterweight, she smiled and added, \u201cThe windows all catch. We keep a butter knife on a string to pry them. We keep it like an heirloom. They\u2019ll call it kitsch, the old ones. They will call it kitsch until they see that it keeps shape when they forget to look. I can spend this much. If you throw in two extra because I lied and told you I can only spend this much, we will be friends forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cFriends forever is expensive,\u201d Ileana said, and Luminita, behind her at the back table, laughed the generous laugh that had first undone a morning at Obor and turned it into a promise. They made lilies that refused to behave, then taught them manners, and when the woman left with a box that knocked softly against her leg, the shop felt as if it had been entrusted with a seriousness it wanted.\n\nThe call from Constan\u021ba came in the hour of the afternoon when the light loses interest and papers become a duty rather than a reward. The driver breathed into the phone in that way people do when they have bad news to deliver to someone who is not their enemy. \u201cDoamn\u0103,\u201d he said, using the formality as a life raft, \u201cbleah, vame\u0219ii, the customs, they want a paper I do not have, which is to say they want money I pretend we do not carry. The container sits. The crane looks at me like a god. You come? Or you bless? I can wait two days before the warehouse man begins to explain patience to me with his elbow.\u201d\n\nShe had learned to keep certain shoes under the counter for moments like this. She told Mara to hand Viorica the key if she came, to tell Marius where the ladder was if the back door sulked, and she kissed the top of the kettle as if asking it to behave in her absence. On the train, she stood because everyone stood, men pretending not to see her while also moving to give her space in that peculiar choreography of care Bucharest men performed when no one was watching, and she watched the fields scroll by, their green licked brown at the edges, hay rolls thrown like punctuation across flat sentences. She had forgotten the smell of the sea that\u2019s not the sea but the port telling you stories about it; in her head, Constan\u021ba\u2019s cranes were birds with good posture and mean tempers, its stacks of containers were books no one read but everyone quoted, and when she got off and the wind shouldered her, the salt was not romance but the metal kind that leaves its taste on the backs of your teeth.\n\nAt the gate, a man with a clipboard and a hairline that had negotiated terms with his skull looked over her head and past her shoulder and then finally, grudgingly, at her face. \u201cIf you are here to cry,\u201d he said, not unkindly, \u201cdo it on that side. It\u2019s the crying side. If you are here to argue, you need this badge. If you are here to bribe, use small bills. They disrespect big ones, think you\u2019re showing off. Who are you? Don\u2019t answer. I know who you are. You are the woman who refused to pay last time and made me find the paper that should have existed all along.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am the woman who reads footnotes,\u201d Ileana said, and he snorted the snort of a man who had once had dreams and now preferred efficiencies. There was an inspector who said the word \u201cprotocol\u201d like a hymn, there was a worker who had learned to smoke with his lip instead of his fingers to keep both hands on what mattered, there was an office that had not changed since a government that no longer existed and would not change under three more. The paper they wanted did exist, but not in the way they wanted it, and she called the woman in a different office who owed her nothing and asked anyway, and the woman looked up the regulation and said, \u201cIf you promise to stop sending me emails at midnight, I will fax you the world,\u201d and Ileana said \u201cI do not promise,\u201d and the woman faxed her the world anyway because sometimes refusing to be charmed is also a way of being charmed.\n\nShe did not pay. She paid in time, which is also currency, and she earned the container back with the kind of sweat that leaves no stain and that no one in the room will later admit to having noticed. The driver hugged her with his shoulder and said a blessing layered with cursing so that the gods would be amused and not take offense, and she stood there a minute and watched the cranes lower and raise their steel necks like pious dinosaurs and thought: this, too, is breath. She sat in a cafe near the port where the cups were chipped and a television in the corner pretended to be essential and counted, for her own stubborn reasons, how many men dipped sugar directly into their mouths before letting the coffee try its luck.\n\nBack at the shop, the floorboards had survived a small flood, because Marius had heard, through the thin rattle of the radio and the fatter rattle of his own thoughts, a hiss behind the wall, and had pried the panel with a neatness that insulted nails. He had cut off the water with that calm anger that belongs to men who have repaired things in silence their entire lives, and when she returned with salt on her clothes, he pointed with his chin at the bucket and at the place where the floor had been lifted and then put back down as gently as a sleeping child. \u201cIt tried to remember it was a boat,\u201d he said, and she laughed because she was tired enough to be obedient to good metaphors. \u201cI told it no. I told it to be a floor. You owe me a rope. And a sandwich.\u201d\n\n\u201cI owe you three ropes,\u201d she said, thinking of the tree and of the way his breath had come down his throat like a saw\u2019s tooth, \u201cand an entire city that learns to mind its hinges when you ask it to.\u201d\n\nThe boys had been to the shop while she was gone and had pressed their noses to the glass and written names into the steam and then wiped them away quickly because they had begun to understand that the pleasure of naming is sometimes in the privacy. One of them had slipped a paper bird into his jacket and then returned an hour later with his aunt and a folded bill and a face that tried to look like it belonged to a man who considered options. \u201cIt flew,\u201d he said, irritated that anyone might find him remarkable. \u201cThen it fell. It needs a perch.\u201d He helped her tie a clear thread to the lamp and tried not to be proud when the bird did what gravity instructed in a way that made it look like hovering. Marius watched from the door and said nothing, reserving the simple sentence for later when the boy kicked the ball against the wall harder than necessary, and then he turned, fixed the latch with two small turns of his wrist, and told the boy, \u201cWanting is not shameful. Even for men. The trick is to learn where to put it.\u201d\n\nThere were days when Viorica refused to be politic. A man marched into the shop with his chest ahead of his thoughts and demanded pills because his wife would not sleep and believed in drops more than in tea. Viorica stood with her cardigan buttoned up to the throat and her eyes two slits of patience and said, \u201cSir, if I sell you placebos, you will come back tomorrow and buy a more expensive lie. If I sell you sun\u0103toare and tei and teach you where to put it in the cup and when to insist on quiet in your house, you will come back next week and pretend it was your idea and I will let you. Which do you prefer? I am cheap only in insults.\u201d He bought both, of course, a vial to hide and a paper bag to show, and Ileana learned again that commerce, in its noble form, is partly theater.\n\nThe building association attempted one more coup, a meeting called under the pretext of \u201csanitation\u201d where a man with a relative in a paving company unveiled a brochure with pictures of German courtyards pretending to be Romanian. There was so much glass that even the pictures looked cold. Ileana brought a jar of rosemary cuttings to the table like an offering and said nothing for ten minutes, letting the men tire themselves, and then she said, when the complications had been made to sound like inevitabilities, \u201cIf you pave this, heat collects. Children fall and their teeth chip. You will become the man who explains to a mother why her little boy\u2019s mouth learned to be less lovely because your cousin sells stones. Do you want to be that man? Or do you want to be the one who can name three birds?\u201d She did not mean it to be a charm. It worked as one anyway, because the old woman with the white hair who had won the last argument for them said, \u201cCioc\u00e2rlie, mierl\u0103, co\u021bofan\u0103,\u201d with relish, and Marius pointed at the plane tree and said, \u201cAnd the wind,\u201d and the paving company brochure, for once in its life, did not convince.\n\nThe forty days collected themselves like strict beads. The coffee diminished, the towels got washed and returned, the basil at the door of the apartment upstairs went from crisp to tired to brown and then bright again because a clever neighbor coaxed it back. On the fortieth, Marius stood like a guard and then like a son and then like a man who will have to decide how to talk about his mother when no priest is handy, and after the small procession, after the candles and the small rush of children\u2019s hands, after the words that always came too late to be useful, he and Ileana walked, not together but in concert, toward the cemetery where Bucharest becomes quiet not out of respect but out of exhaustion. The path laced itself with old names and proud ones and ones written by a hand that hadn\u2019t been taught to flourish, and every fifth grave had a plastic flower that had dimmed to a color not in nature, and Ileana put the white bird she had tied with thread on the corner of the stone and did not take a photograph because some things want to be proof only for the people who were there.\n\n\u201cHow did you get that?\u201d she asked him finally, when the silence had grown comfortable enough to hold a story without dropping it, touching her wrist in the same place his scar made lace. He looked at his own, turned it, judged it as if he were appraising a tool at the market. \u201cA belt caught my hand at the factory when I was nineteen and thought I was invincible, which is to say stupid,\u201d he said, in that flat tone that refused pity on entry. \u201cIt sent me home for three weeks to learn that I liked the way the courtyard smells after rain more than I liked men yelling at me to hurry with bolts. I went back because you go back. The second time I left because my mother fell, and then I did not go back because things needed fixing closer to our door. I became the man who knows doors. It is not a profession. It pays me in the absence of fire. I do not hate it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI make order out of paper,\u201d she said, like a confession and like a joke, and he nodded because for once the sentence did not need to learn irony to live.\n\nThe newspaper discovered the shop the way newspapers discover things that have been waiting like small friendly traps for years. It sent a woman with a notebook who tried to be invisible and then gave up and asked questions and then stopped asking and cut a petal and taped it badly and decided not to be embarrassed by being taught. The headline, when it came, made her choke on her toast: \u201cFor the Living and the Dead: A Shop Where Paper Holds.\u201d There was a photograph where her hand looked more confident than her face, there was a paragraph that convinced even C\u0103t\u0103lin to stop saying \u201ccrafts\u201d as if he were allergic, there was a sentence that made her mother phone and say, \u201cYou look tired but important,\u201d which was the closest thing to unambiguous praise the woman had in her pantry. Sorin sent a message with no letters, only a half-smile and a question mark, and she moved the message into the folder where she stored other things she refused to feed.\n\nThe hospital ward made its own kind of weather. The lilies sat on the windowsill like brave soldiers. A woman whose granddaughter had braided blue into her hair the day before said, \u201cThey will not die on me,\u201d and picked one up and examined it like a problem she could finally solve. A man with fingers that trembled less when he held wire asked if he could keep the bell until the nurse told him he couldn\u2019t, and the nurse did not. At night, when Ileana lay down, she could see where the paper\u2019s grain had given a petal a line like a life line in a palm, and it pleased her in a way she did not try to explain to herself.\n\nThere was theft, again, delightfully. A bouquet went, a small one, the kind that sits in the bend of an elbow on the way to an apology. Ileana lifted the absence in her hand and felt the flare of anger the city teaches you to keep ready, and then she put it down and let the pride replace it, because she had decided that pride, in reasonable doses, kept a woman from shrinking for no pay. Marius made a show of checking the screws on the display and said, as if instructing her in a recipe, that if you arrange the stems with the cut side toward the door the petty thieves might hesitate because they fear sap, even if there is none. \u201cPeople who take without asking,\u201d he said, \u201care often idioti with manners toward plants.\u201d\n\nThe tailor\u2019s shop became, in the fastest way a room can, a place people started giving addresses with when they wanted a friend to know they were paying attention. \u201cAt the paper,\u201d they said, and meant the corner with the strange light and the woman who tried not to boss you unless her eyebrows lost patience. Viorica started to leave her bottles in a row that made an army of browns; she behaved as if she had always kept office hours there and then scolded a teenager into eating soup with garlic when he confessed he hadn\u2019t breathed through his nose in a week. Luminita, who had taught her bracelets to learn a softer chime in small rooms, started a class made only of people who claimed they did not need companionship and then claimed it anyway. Mara kept a list of the worst fonts people suggested for their poster, and when the list reached ten, she bought a pastry and said she would forgive the city anything for sugar.\n\nOne afternoon, the light decided to show off. It came through the old glass and fractured itself on dust and hung in the air as if it had come to class late and wanted to demonstrate that it could still answer questions. Ileana took down the white birds and dusted the thread with the careful pinch of someone who knows how little frays matter until they suddenly do, and she thought of the first day she had met Luminita and touched crepe without believing in her own fingers, and of the way she had said no to the easy money and yes to the thing with no guarantee, and of the way a man like Marius could hold a rope and tell a branch when to surrender. She wondered if everything she loved now was a way of convincing herself that control existed, even in small clever forms, even in rooms that leak, even in courtyards where men vote on light, and the thought did not shame her. There are worse religions than faith in a hinge that obeys oil.\n\nIn the evening, the D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba did that trick it had not tired of, holding on its back the entire neighborhood in pieces: a window with a woman\u2019s hair in it, a neon pharmacy cross that blinked as if to keep time for ambulances, a lamp that made old paint on a bridge look like a blessing. The wind had learned everyone\u2019s names by now, or at least their whistles; it slipped between buildings the way people slip into rooms where they\u2019re not expected but know they\u2019ll be tolerated. Ileana walked slower than she had when the shop was an idea that pinched; she could afford to take time from herself and hand it back. The bench in the courtyard was free for the first time all afternoon, the dog having decided to inspect a more promising smell near the bins, and she sat and counted not taxis but windows that let their curtains be open, and the number surprised her. She had always imagined the city closed against itself; she had been wrong in a way she could enjoy.\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Marius said from the shadow near the gate, not emerging as if to honor the old liturgy he had invented for them where their most important sentences lived near the edge of seeing, \u201cwe will take down the pom.\u201d He had put off the act not because he was sentimental, which he distrusted in himself, but because he believed in certain arbitrary intervals. \u201cBring your scissors with the black handle. Not the ones your mother used. They bite.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will bring the ones that forgive me when I pull wrong,\u201d she said, and in the way the courtyard accepted the sentence and held it and then let it go, there was the smallest kind of peace. She wrote a list when she climbed the stairs, not because it would save her, but because it would remind the part of her that fussed that there were things she could do while the city made its ancient, ridiculous plans. Wire. Lavender. Receipt book. Rope. Kettle gaskets. A plant that is not rosemary, because we must not demand too much from one soldier. And at the very end, underlined because it had become a form of prayer: call Viorica; ask for a story to get us through winter.They took down the pom in a morning that had the patience of a slow kettle. Light entered the courtyard as if someone had loosened a faucet, a trickle that dared not turn into a rush. The boys, who had carried it with such gravity weeks ago, had already begun to grow in the way boys do when grief makes them pretend to be furniture\u2014useful, quiet, sturdy, a place for other people to put cups. Today they had the twitch in their legs again; they wanted tasks that felt like danger but could be disguised as duty. Marius brought out the old wooden ladder and leaned it into the tree\u2019s shoulder as if it were leaning into a man who had promised not to move. Ileana stood with her black-handled scissors, not the ones her mother had used, and felt for the first time that the blades had moods. The paper was softer where fingers had touched it for weeks, oil turning crispness into a compliant satin. She cut the threads that held bells and leaves and biscuits, and each time a ribbon came loose and fell into her hand she thought of a sentence being unstitched quietly so that the meaning could be used again elsewhere.\n\nThey kept the coins for the church\u2019s box not because anyone needed to be conscientious about accounting but because ritual pays its debts how it can. The apples had shriveled into smaller truths; the youngest boy bit into one, grimaced, and then finished it with the bravado of someone who had decided to be stubborn on principle. A neighbor who had mislaid her spectacles and found them on top of her head twice in the same hour stood to collect the paper bells with the kind of care that would have made you think they were porcelain. \u201cFor Easter,\u201d she said, though no one asked her to justify herself, and then whispered to Ileana as if they were sharing contraband gossip, \u201cI like it when things last too long and make people nervous.\u201d\n\nWhen the wire crown came off the top of the pom, Marius bent it back into a line with his palms, slow, as if he were listening for its permission to be straight again. His face was back to its practiced privacy, but his hands were less stingy. He passed Ileana the bent shape, and she coiled it like a snake that had remembered being a rope. \u201cWe make another,\u201d he said, not to fill the air but because repetition had become a form of respect. \u201cFor someone we do not yet know. That is a good way to spend a day.\u201d\n\nAfter the pom, after the biscuits were redistributed and the stubborn apple core was thrown to the dog by a boy who pretended the dog\u2019s delight was beneath his notice, the courtyard resumed its weekday argument with time. The building\u2019s pipes shouted once and then held their peace. Somewhere an impatient shoe learned the rhythm of the stairwell. In the shop, the kettle did its old trick of sulking until talked to like a friend who might leave, then boiled as if it had never doubted itself. Luminita came late and apologetic, bracelets subdued, a new cut on her thumb that she waved away with the breezy contempt of a woman who has had worse. \u201cMy daughter-in-law says we should put our classes on Facebook,\u201d she announced, as if they were considering inviting an ancient aunt to a party. \u201cI told her Facebook is a square where everyone screams and counts that as conversation. She called me medieval. I told her I prefer ages where people look at you when they lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can do both,\u201d Mara called from the counter, where she had arranged small birds in a row to resemble a sentence only she could read. \u201cThe square and the room. One pays in clicks, the other pays in people. Both currencies are unreliable, but at least the people sometimes bring pickles.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not bait me with pickles,\u201d Viorica said from the doorway, and dropped a bundle of dried lavender on the counter like an assignment. \u201cFor your moths. And for your nerves. A city is a mouth. It will chew you unless you make it bite something else. Today I bring a story about a woman who tried to heal a fever with brandy and then married the man who brought her water instead. It will get us through November.\u201d\n\nShe told it while they cut paper to the width of a thumb. It was a shabby story at first, a story of a woman whose kitchen had a floor that sloped toward the door so that soup was obliged to learn maritime law, and of a doctor who had learned, young, that if you arrive with authority and a clean collar, people forgive you almost anything. The brandy was a neighbor\u2019s prescription, the water was the doctor\u2019s, and the temperature dropped because time did what it sometimes does when you are watching it too closely and decides you do not deserve a lesson you have paid for. \u201cThe woman married the doctor,\u201d Viorica concluded, rolling a piece of green tape between her fingers until it warmed to her will, \u201cand then spent forty years telling him that it had been the water. He let her have it, which is the only reason they lasted. Men are not saved by tinctures. They are saved by choosing which parts of the story to insist on.\u201d She looked at Marius as if to make sure he had heard. He nodded gravely, which in his language was the same as a laugh.\n\nWhen the weather lowered its chin and breathed chill, the shop filled with the kind of customers who had opinions about warmth. A woman with a small dog in her big bag demanded birds with gold edges for a chandelier because the electrician had told her she could not hang anything heavy with the way the ceiling had been compromised by a leak three tenants ago. \u201cGold,\u201d she said, tapping her nail against the counter as if it were a snare drum. \u201cBut tasteful. I do not want my living room to look like a cake.\u201d A man ordered paper poppies to lay at a monument and took offense when Luminita tried to steer him toward a red that wasn\u2019t the exact red his grandfather had mouthed the word for. \u201cThe exact one,\u201d he said, showing a photograph where the colors had been ruined by time into a truth of their own. \u201cOur dead are particular. They do not forgive approximations.\u201d They made the petals darker than any poppy would dare be in an obedient field, and he lifted the finished bouquet with hands that understood receiving instructions and not liking it.\n\nWith the cold came a new logistics problem, which was simply the old problem wearing a thicker coat. The container that had nearly been held in Constan\u021ba arrived wheezing, and the driver called from the hive of trucks near the ring road to say he\u2019d be late because men in reflective vests had decided to argue philosophy with cones. Ileana learned the trick of telling a client that their order was en route in a tone that conceded nothing and apologized for nothing, and when Mara managed to talk a warehouse manager into staying open for an extra hour on the strength of a lie about frozen syrups, they sent each other a message with a single goat emoji and a time, their code for not being entirely defeated by the day. Sorin\u2019s name stopped appearing in the inbox like a sting; when it popped up once, weeks after he had signed the paper that made him a figure in a story rather than a participant, it arrived with an invitation to a holiday party and a tone that imagined itself as magnanimity. She archived it without sentiment and went to check on the heater\u2019s habit of sulking.\n\nOn a morning brittle with a frost that made even the loudest men adjust their voices, the hospital nurse returned to collect a second order. Her badge had slid on its string to the angle that nurses\u2019 badges always adopt, the angle of someone who has brushed against too many tragedies in too narrow a hallway. \u201cThey said it was kitsch,\u201d she admitted, holding the box as if it were a small animal that might startle easily, \u201cand then one of the old men asked if he could take the lily with him when he was transferred, and the young doctor who thinks evidence is a religion said yes with his face and no with his mouth, and the old man found a way to take it anyway. It is sitting on his tray like a friend who has forgiven you for having been boring.\u201d She paused and looked at Ileana with curiosity that had learned its manners. \u201cWhy paper for the dying?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause the shape holds,\u201d Ileana said, only a little rehearsed by now, because some thoughts become furniture and you learn to run your hand over them when you pass. \u201cAnd because a fresh thing decays and reproaches you, and paper keeps its peace. It is not honest; I know. But existence allows cheats when the test is cruel.\u201d She gave the nurse two extra bells because there are economies you can afford when your profit is not entirely counted in bills.\n\nThat same week, the building declared war on its own pipes. A banging began behind the wall like a neighbor practicing the drum without having first discovered rhythm; then came a hiss and then a thin jet of water that had no intention of negotiating. Marius appeared with his little army\u2014the wrench that had belonged to another man\u2019s grandfather, the roll of Teflon tape that resented hurry, the old cloths that had once been a good shirt\u2014and shut off the right valve with the accuracy of a father reaching for a falling glass. He did not curse, which was how she knew it was bad. The downstairs neighbor, whose timeshare with rage had been generous and public, arrived at the shop door with a look that told them the city could be sued and would laugh. \u201cIt dripped on my bread,\u201d he announced, all liturgy. \u201cGod will punish you. Or I will.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring the bread,\u201d Viorica said from the counter, not looking up from a label she was writing that requested that people not take more than two droppers at once unless they wanted their stomachs to learn remarkable new tricks. \u201cI will cut off the wet parts. You will eat. Then you will help carry the bucket. God punishes those who never bring the bucket.\u201d The man looked prepared to be outraged and then, without fanfare, obeyed. Sometimes the pivot between fury and usefulness is only a sentence spoken in no one\u2019s special language.\n\nOn a Thursday, with the window glass dull from the city\u2019s breath, a woman came in with a veil that signaled loss but not how recently it had arrived. She had a small boy by the hand, the kind of boy who counted cracks in the floor and then tried to step on only the light ones. She looked at the white carnations and put her fingers to the base of her throat in the old gesture people make when their body wants to prove it\u2019s still there. \u201cMy mother had these,\u201d she said, the way someone says \u201cThat was my street,\u201d not asking for ownership, only trying on the fit. \u201cShe said the paper forgave her for having to do this twice. I want a cluster. Not too neat. She was not neat. She was\u2026 generous. Generosity makes a mess.\u201d\n\n\u201cMess we can do,\u201d Luminita said, and the way she scattered the petals looked like luck but was, of course, precision disguised. The boy squeezed the end of the green tape until it stuck to itself and then made a little sound of disapproval at his own error. Marius, who pretended not to know children unless they needed a bandage or a door closed, took the tape and reversed it neatly as if errors were a currency he liked to handle. \u201cI wanted to bring real flowers,\u201d the woman said as if confessing greed in a church. \u201cMy sister said they would be a waste. My aunt said paper is for brothels and parastase. I said, then let the brothels and parastase teach us how to keep color.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will never go wrong listening to brothels and parastase,\u201d Viorica remarked without a pause, and when the woman laughed, the room took that laugh and put it carefully on the shelf where they kept small, useful things.\n\nThe tailor\u2019s shop next door let a rumor loose that warmed the street; there was to be a winter fair in the triangle where the tram turned and husbands leaned and watched their breath. It was a shabby sort of fair with a tent that smelled like soup, but there would be a stage and a man with an accordion who owed money to a woman who sold onions and there would be mulled wine in cups that would stain everyone\u2019s mouths the same optimistic red. Mara volunteered their presence before asking, and Ileana said yes before counting because sometimes you must learn to throw yourself into a market and see who catches you. They prepared over-red roses that would laugh in the face of poinsettias, and birds with tails that flickered like small flames, and wreaths that would let a door pretend to be a gate into a more forgiving place.\n\nOn the day, the wind came and left like a lover with an appointment; it tugged hair and made the tent flap like a big mouth trying not to laugh. They arranged their table with the precision of people who were not going to be mocked today, not because they were fragile but because they had decided to refuse the effort of deflecting. C\u0103t\u0103lin came by twice, the first time to remark that the table would do better closer to the stage, the second time to say a man he knew could get them real plastic flowers at such a price that they would think they\u2019d robbed him. \u201cWe are committed to our ridiculousness,\u201d Ileana said simply, and he nodded in the way men nod when they realize no amount of reason will dislodge someone\u2019s pleasure.\n\nThe children loved the birds, to no one\u2019s surprise. They tugged at the invisible thread and delighted in the way the body of the bird refused to be entirely obedient to gravity. A teenager with a face he\u2019d practiced in the mirror bought a small violet because he had been told once that violet was the color of fidelity and he wanted, for once, to be on the right side of a symbol. An old man with hands like bark told them, as if they had asked, that his wife had made paper peonies for the baptisms of all three daughters and then stopped when one daughter decided to be done with the church and the other two moved away and forgot to ask permission to be happy. \u201cI still have them,\u201d he said, and the words carried the grain of both boast and mourning. \u201cThey are ugly with dust. They are also the most beautiful things I own.\u201d\n\nLate in the day, as the stage creaked under a group of boys with a hip-hop song they had written to insult each other lovingly, as Viorica argued bourbon versus rum in mulled wine with a woman whose apron had remembered every soup she had ever made, a woman with a microphone approached the table and asked if anyone would talk into the air about what, exactly, they were selling. \u201cOrder,\u201d Mara said, without looking up, and the woman laughed until she realized the answer would not get better if she waited. Ileana said, because she had learned which sentences to reach for when the air asked, that they made flowers for the living rooms of people who could not be trusted to water a plant and also for the rooms where no one dared bring a bucket, that they made birds for windows that insisted on showing people the wrong scene, and that they made wreaths for doors that had learned to choose who to open for and who to leave on the landing. The woman wrote nothing down and thanked them and tried to summarize and failed, which pleased Ileana more than a clean paragraph would have.\n\nWhen the fair ended and the men unhooked the tent from the sky and folded it badly, the street felt bigger for having been used without injury. They counted their coins not with a miser\u2019s delight but to see if the city had given them its old yes. They had enough to pay for trays of cabbage rolls and extra glue and the bottle of brandy Viorica wanted to keep in the back for the kind of days that only yield to rituals older than science. Marius carried the crate back to the shop with one hand, the other hand in his pocket as if to telegraph that nothing on the street was a threat. When they reached the door, he said, half to himself, half to the hinge, that he could smell snow, and they all looked up like children promised a show.\n\nSnow fell like someone had finally stopped asking the sky to be reasonable. It came in flakes fat enough to be counted and made the D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba look like an old woman\u2019s shawl shaken from a chest. There is a particular hush that happens in Bucharest when snow decides to take its job seriously. For a few hours, even the men who insist on their car\u2019s right to block the tram behave like citizens of a place that can be improved by silence. Ileana watched the river fold itself and then improvise again and counted the taxis that chose to stop because it felt stingy not to. She texted her mother to say \u201cIt snows\u201d and her mother sent back a photo of a pot on the stove, the steam rising like a saint. The shop grew candlelight-fat; people came in to warm their hands and left with birds because birds looked good against winter. A young father bought a single white carnation because his daughter had said at breakfast that the weather made her heart feel like a fish in a jar and he had no idea what to do with such a sentence except take it seriously.\n\nThe cold brings with it a mean-spirited generosity: it clarifies. The building\u2019s windows separated themselves into those that wept and those that held their ground; the gate told them exactly when it would stick and why, and Marius, who carried a crumb of graphite in his pocket like a talisman, drew a line where the metal lied about itself and shaved the lie off. He climbed the plane tree once to knock snow from branches that pretended they were stronger than they were, and when he came down with white pushed into the crook of his cap he looked younger and not at all absurd. He told the boys that snow was the only teacher who could make them quiet; they ignored the insult and built a fort that pretended to be a castle and learned, without admitting it, the sweetness of holding a line together.\n\nIn a pocket of afternoon when the light forgot to be brave, Viorica arrived with a jar of something that moved slowly. \u201cQuince,\u201d she declared, setting it down with the authority of an old cookbook, which is to say, godlike. \u201cFor irritating throats and nostalgia. Both respond to sugar cooked until it tells the truth.\u201d She wore a knitted hat that made her look like a woman who did not tolerate cold if she could insult it into submission. \u201cTell me a problem,\u201d she demanded, and when no one volunteered, she provided one. \u201cI have a niece who reads on her phone until her eyes are the color of old bricks. She refuses to rest because her friends live in her palm. I will not sell her drops; I will sell her boredom. We will learn to sit and watch steam. It is not a modern cure. It is a good one.\u201d\n\n\u201cTeach a class,\u201d Ileana said, because the room had begun to feel eager for such sentences. \u201cNot here. Here, the steam will carry the glue into our lungs and we will die of our own ambitions. In your shop. On days the wind is rude. Call it decanting. People will pretend to understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI refuse to teach,\u201d Viorica said with relish. \u201cI will host. I will let the jars speak for themselves. I have told them to behave in guests\u2019 presence. They are well brought up.\u201d\n\nToward the solstice, when the city eats sausages and waits for it all to be over, Sorin appeared in the shop, smelling like the part of winter that costs extra. He stood in the doorway like a man who has learned to make his silhouette into a signature and smiled in a way he thought charming when it had often, elsewhere, scored points. \u201cSo this is where you hide,\u201d he said, looking past her with the cultivated interest of a collector who has stumbled on an object that might yet become a trend. \u201cI read about it. I thought, surely not. But here you are, with, what do they call it, artisanal\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFlowers,\u201d Ileana said, relieved at how easily her mouth refused to be managed. \u201cThey are not a concept. You can buy one if you intend to take it home and not put it on a conference room table as a conversation piece. If you are here to suggest painting the walls dark and installing a neon sign, I will ask Marius to escort you to the gate and instruct it to close.\u201d\n\nSorin looked at Marius and calculated, for once honestly, and decided to become generous. He picked up a bird with careful fingers, the way men handle small things that might embarrass them, and tilted it so the light traced its back. \u201cFor my daughter,\u201d he said, and she had forgotten for a moment that he contained people who did not smell like his cologne. \u201cShe has become a critic. She will tell me if it is sincere enough to be tolerated. She has learned this word at school: authentic. I cannot stand it, and I am grateful for it.\u201d He put money on the counter and added more than was logical, and Mara started to mock him and then, seeing the way his eyes took stock of the corners as if he were finding a place where he might, in another life, have been useful, decided to be merciful. He left with the bird wrapped in paper that had once been a newspaper story about a politician who had since left the country, and for once the paper served a purpose beyond its assigned pretense.\n\nOn the last day of the year, when fireworks practice all afternoon like untrained brass, the courtyard produced its own rough pageantry. The old woman with the white hair brought a jar of compote she had saved for a moment when someone else\u2019s mouth needed sweetness; the boys lit sparklers and discovered, to general relief, that they were not yet the kind of men who could be trusted with explosives; a teenager kissed another teenager with a bravery that made Marius find a hinge to fix intently; Viorica pretended to disdain the music that came from a neighbor\u2019s radio and then hummed while she counted how many cups had gone missing as if each cup were a person who owed her a debt. At midnight, the D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba reflected the wild and bad decisions of the city with a stoic little shimmy. Ileana stood under the balcony and counted backwards because she liked the way numbers lined up when you granted them an ending. Seven, six, five, and she thought of the list she had written the day the ginkgo went yellow and how most of it had been done by hands other than hers and how this did not offend her at all.\n\nShe went to sleep with the noise lodged in the curtains and woke to a quiet that felt borrowed. In the blunt morning, she wrote in her notebook before coffee because she had learned not to trust herself to remember if she deferred. The list was short; it made her uneasy, as if a day with only four instructions might decide to go feral. She added small things\u2014buy more tape, speak kindly to kettle, ask Marius his mother\u2019s second favorite joke\u2014and then put the notebook down as if it were a pet that had fallen asleep on her lap and didn\u2019t mind being displaced.\n\nIn January, the river grew a small skin that broke when pigeons put their minds to it. The city pretended to be resigned and was, in fact, simply cold. The hospital called for more lilies, because the new doctor who measured his kindness in metastable doses had been converted by a woman who thanked the flowers instead of him, and his resistance to anything he could not measure had wilted in the face of gratitude that recognized allies. The tailor next door closed for two weeks because his daughter had given birth in Spain to a child who would learn to count in a language he would only love second-best, and the shop lended him its key so his son could come in and stand and pretend to be in charge of something while he figured out whether his ribs could carry pride.\n\nThere were bad days that bloomed without warning, as bad days always do. A man came in and insulted the price and the premise and left having given nothing and taken thirty minutes of their time and the energy that they could otherwise have used to be patient with themselves. A box of crepe arrived the wrong weight and the warehouse manager insisted the scales had been calibrated by God and she had to spend an afternoon proving that human hands cheat because life requires us to practice. A child tore a bird and cried, and his mother scolded him with her shame disguised as authority, and Luminita had to take them both in hand and declare that everyone was being ridiculous because paper is a thing that forgives even when people don\u2019t.\n\nOn a day when the light did not rise beyond a reluctantly polite glow, a woman from a cultural institute came in with hair that had learned the hard way to be restrained. She wore a scarf that announced funding and asked, with the eagerness of someone who had been told to go find authenticity and could now bring it to a meeting, whether they would consider a workshop in a room with white walls and a video camera set like a trap. Ileana said yes because she wanted to watch people discover their hands in rooms where their voices had been trained to echo, and she said no to the part where the video clip would be cut with dramatic music because paper did not need violins to be understood. Mara designed a flyer with exactly the right amount of black and exactly the right weight of paper, and the institute woman cried at a petal because she had been forced, by her job, to become an expert at pretend.\n\nThe day after, when it seemed the city had gone back to biting itself out of habit, Marius knocked on Ileana\u2019s door with a hammer tucked under his arm as if it were a polite dog. \u201cYou wrote,\u201d he said, unembarrassed to have read her list where it lay on the counter near the kettle, \u201cto ask my mother\u2019s second joke. Her first was not for polite company. The second was that God made the wind and the priests take credit. It made her laugh alone in the kitchen. It will not sound funny if you say it at a party. That is good. Humor should be private.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will tell it to the kettle,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will boil from relief.\u201d He leaned against the doorframe and looked at her rosemary as if it were an old friend who had learned to pretend to be new. \u201cShe would have liked this shop,\u201d he added after a small silence in which the building considered whether to creak or keep its dignity. \u201cNot because of the flowers. Because people come to be asked for nothing. She would have come and told Luminita she was making too much fringe and then told her a recipe and stolen a spoon. She would have argued with Viorica about licorice root until they fell into agreement out of exhaustion. She would have told you that the gate is your best advertisement, because it opens without complaining.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I am doing something right,\u201d Ileana said, and though she knew better than to ask for approval from the dead, she felt the kind of measurable peace that the living can convert into work.\n\nFebruary tried to be cruel in new ways but found it had already used up its tricks. The boys discovered a new game with the rope and did not hang themselves with it. The building association tried one last resolution to pave the courtyard and lost not because anyone had made a speech but because half the people decided to make soup instead of attend. Sorin sent a postcard from somewhere warm with a photo of a fruit that looked indecent and wrote only \u201cCourage,\u201d which was a word he had never used when it had been needed. Viorica\u2019s jar class became a rumor that made strangers knock and ask, cautiously, whether boredom was, in fact, for sale. Luminita announced that she would teach a session on funerary wreaths that did not insult the dead by pretending they were never rude, and the class filled with women who had learned to love without bleached corners.\n\nOn a morning that held itself upright like a conscientious chair, the apothecary\u2019s bell rang before Viorica had turned her sign, and she barked at the door in a tone that would have made a general sit down. It was a woman with a hat like an apology, who explained in four sentences and a half-swallowed sob that her mother had died the previous night with a curse in her mouth and a request that made no sense. \u201cShe said,\u201d the woman reported, wringing her hands not because it helped but because she needed to see they were still attached, \u201cto bring her girls something that lasts and looks like a lie.\u201d Viorica, who would insult men into health but never laughed at the confused request of a daughter, wrote a list that contained, among practicals\u2014candles, coffee, sugar\u2014only one instruction that mattered. \u201cGo to the paper,\u201d she said. \u201cAsk for white that looks wrong. The dead, sometimes, appreciate our reluctance to be obedient.\u201d\n\nIleana made a wreath with leaves that insisted on their grain and bells that did not line up on purpose. They tied a blue ribbon under the white because the woman\u2019s hat had a single stitch of blue at the brim, and the effect pleased no one and satisfied the truth. When the woman took it, when her hands steadied for the span of two breaths, Ileana felt a fatigue lift off her shoulders like a coat. There are works that repay on delivery; this was one. She wanted to write it down\u2014the exact angle of wrongness that works when grief is a poor audience\u2014and knew that some things refused a ledger.\n\nToward the end of winter, the D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba began its lazy rehearsal for spring. Bottles that had frozen into small sculptures shivered themselves loose; gulls came back in committees and inspected their old arguments; a man washed a car with water from a bucket and made a mess of his ankles and did not mind. The rosemary by the window put out a sprig that looked greener than it had any right to be. The boys\u2019 fort dissolved into reasonable piles. The gate\u2019s hinge needed oil and got it. The shop learned the names of people\u2019s grandchildren as if they were a currency required to be legal, and Luminita taught a class of teenagers to make peonies that would eventually, when photographed in a mirror, become declarations of someone\u2019s new room. Marius repaired a hinge for an old woman who insisted on paying him in string and he accepted without altering his face, and on the way back he stopped at the bench and called the wind by its name in a voice too low for anyone but the plane tree to appreciate.\n\nOne evening, when the light had that thrift-store gold that makes everything look like a bargain, Ileana locked the shop, put the bottle of quince in her bag because it had promised to make a visit to her mother more palatable, and sat on the bench to count taxis not because she needed to but because repetition had become a hobby. Marius sat, not touching, and told her, quite simply and with his voice smaller than usual, that he had had a bad dream. It involved the factory belt and his mother and the gate refusing to open and the wind turning its back. He said it without drama, as if reporting a new sound in the pipes, and she listened in the same key. When he was done, he said, \u201cI went downstairs and stood in the courtyard so it would be stupid to be afraid, and the dog put his nose in my hand like he was paying for something and then ran away. It helped. Or it did not. It is hard to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will ask Viorica for a story,\u201d she said. \u201cOr for a bottle without a label. Sometimes labels make their contents shy.\u201d He nodded and took the quince and said he would tell her if he hated it, because that would be a mercy, and she laughed, a small, exhausted, grateful laugh that made the evening tuck itself in.\n\nSpring would find them. It would arrive not because they had arranged themselves worthily but because the city is generous with its cycles. For now, in a winter that had shown its teeth and then let them rest, they sat with their hands empty, not taking inventory, and watched the small movements\u2014the river\u2019s edge relearning the trick of ripple, the gate agreeing with its hinge, the boys stomping their boots to hear the hollow thud\u2014that make a life you can bear to live.By March the city remembered its old trick of tying red to white and pretending a thread could hold winter away. The first morning of M\u0103r\u021bi\u0219or, tram handles wore tiny tassels, and girls on the tram pretended not to notice who had pinned what to whose coat, and men with the practiced shame of tenderness fumbled in pockets for string like contraband. Obor was a rash of stalls that looked like someone had tipped a sewing basket over Bucharest; plastic clover and silver hearts and the small, miraculous women who made delicate knots with hands that had wrung laundry their whole lives argued for attention in a register that didn\u2019t tax the ears. Luminita had decided, with the briskness of a woman who considered tradition another material to be cut, that paper could be a M\u0103r\u021bi\u0219or, too, and the first morning she had, pinned to a length of string on her table, tiny bells that were irreverent, a red peony no wider than a coin, a white bird that flinched at its own shadow and then held. \u201cThey will say it is too much,\u201d she predicted, slicing the tramp\u2019s red thread with scissors that looked like they might take offense at modernity, \u201cand then their fingers will betray them. People buy excess in March because it is cheap forgiveness.\u201d\n\nIleana bought too many, then talked her way out of shame by delivering half to the hospital nurse who had begun to use the shop as a place to breathe and to finish a thought. The nurse\u2019s badge had learned to sit straight for a change; she pinned a paper bell to its corner and said, in the voice of a person who knew how to make bureaucracy obey desire for ten seconds at a time, that the head of the ward had requested \u201cthe ridiculous white ones.\u201d She was smiling when she said \u201cridiculous,\u201d and her smile suggested that any surgeon who sneered would be made to fetch a butter knife on a string to open a stubborn window as penance. \u201cIf you come Thursday,\u201d she added, \u201cthere will be music. Not the kind you pretend to like. A man with a violin who doesn\u2019t mind if he makes us cry and will also know how to play the thing my grandmother called hora lumii.\u201d\n\nAt the shop, red and white accumulations made the windows look like a small weather system. Mara tied threads around the necks of birds and refused to make a single pun about string theory, which was how Ileana knew she had been charmed against her will. Viorica turned her bottles so their labels faced the light like faces waiting to be kissed and declared that M\u0103r\u021bi\u0219or was a racket and also indispensable. \u201cWe bribed spring before we could bribe officials,\u201d she said, pushing a jar of honey forward for prominence. \u201cIt never worked as well as we hoped, but at least we invented good knots.\u201d\n\nThe city, for its part, felt permitted. Men stopped to look in the window without performing a yawn and then caught themselves and moved on; women came in with the decision to buy already made and only asked permission to enjoy it. An influencer arrived, obligatory as pollen. She had the kind of hair that had a budget, and she pointed her phone at the birds and then at her own mouth and then, mercifully, at the ceiling. \u201cWe adore,\u201d she said to the square rectangle, and Mara stood at the counter like a bouncer in a museum and said, \u201cWe sell,\u201d which ought to have been a collision and became, instead, a sort of public health disclaimer. The woman hesitated, put her phone down, and bought a violet no one had asked her to love. \u201cFor my mother,\u201d she said, a little sheepish in the way of people used to being admired and unprepared for needing to be forgiven. \u201cShe hates the internet.\u201d When she left, Mara wrote a note and stuck it on the counter: we do not accept exposure; we tan badly, and they laughed into the soft space it made.\n\nInspection arrived as all things that begin with a stamp do, unannounced and prepared to be offended. A man whose blazer had outlived two governments whistled through his front teeth at the fire extinguisher and found the kettle cord adventurous and took notes on a pad that had learned to wrinkle its own paper as if it disapproved of what was being written. \u201cAuthorization for assembling foodstuffs?\u201d he asked Viorica with a carnivore\u2019s politeness, gesturing to the corner where quince winked in a jar like a slow eye.\n\n\u201cI am not assembling,\u201d Viorica said, standing on her dignity with the grace of a goat on a roof. \u201cI am decanting. The law has yet to learn the difference because it is busy preventing youth from eating seeds on buses. Do you intend to fine me for syrup?\u201d The inspector smiled, which was alarming; he had the smile of a man who learned long ago to enjoy the sound of the word \u201creceipt.\u201d Ileana stepped in with the other kind of smile\u2014the one that offered a binder before he had asked and pointed with relief at a photocopy of a document obtained at the end of a long line where she had had time to design three classes in her head. \u201cHere,\u201d she said. \u201cAuthorization for sale of non-therapeutic herbal preparations. Here, the extinguisher, recent and enthusiastic. And here\u201d\u2014she placed a little white bird on his clipboard because she had learned the gambler\u2019s art of the inappropriate\u2014\u201cis a gift for your daughter or your mother or the fine woman at the office who does the work for you. Take it now and then decide if you want to find a problem that doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nHe tried very hard to mind his dignity. He took the bird, regretted taking the bird with the entire right side of his face, and looked around as if a hole in the floor would be polite enough to open under him and allow him to fall away from consequence. \u201cThe cord,\u201d he said at last, sighing as if he had hoped to enjoy this more. \u201cYou will change it. And you will tell the kettle to respect the electricity. And you will not boil the city with sentiment.\u201d \u201cWe will not,\u201d Ileana said, and after he left, the kettle boiled in a fit of pique and they all drank without saying the word \u201cmercy.\u201d\n\nIt was the month of mucenici, dough loops that masqueraded as figure-eights and swam in syrup thick with walnuts and orange peel. Mara declared it a religious holiday for her tongue and went missing with a plastic bowl; she returned contrite and sugared and insisted on washing every cup in the place to make up for the syrup that had managed to visit her elbow. On the ninth, Marius told the story of martyrs in a voice flat as the D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba when wind is in a mood to sulk, and the boys pretended to be bored while memorizing the parts where bones outlasted orders. \u201cNine,\u201d he said to the gate, as if gates had an interest in arithmetic. \u201cEnough to make a line. Not enough to fool a wind.\u201d He brought a pot of mucenici someone had pressed into his hands in the courtyard\u2014a pot older than whoever had made the pastries in it\u2014and Viorica declared them sinful and asked for a second bowl that she said was for science and did not elaborate.\n\nThere were complications that did not present themselves as drama, which made them difficult to take seriously and then, predictably, expensive. The landlord who owned the narrow strip of roof above the shop decided to sell his sky to someone who preferred billboards to light, and for two days men in reflective vests looked at the parapet like a problem that could be solved with a louder voice. \u201cNo,\u201d said the old woman with the white hair, who had nerves men respected without discovering they did, and then pointed her cane at the place where rain had always entered the building without first asking how long it could stay. \u201cIf you put your metal there, our damp becomes yours. You will inherit mushrooms in your walls. We are generous people. We share everything.\u201d It bought them a week, and within that week Mara found the regulation no one remembered, the one about heritage sight lines and the obligation to pretend dawn mattered, and Ileana wrote a letter that was more elegant than polite, and they wrote \u201cno\u201d on a piece of paper in a font that made the answer feel older than the men\u2019s patience, and the men went away to install their light somewhere else and claim victory.\n\nWhen she could afford an absence, Ileana took the overnight train east because the wet had lifted for a day and her mother had announced on the phone that she had cooked too much and needed to be prevented from killing herself by thrift. The compartment smelled like old perfume that had learned to live with cabbage. A woman in the upper berth told the story of a man from Tecuci who had built a house alone and had forgotten the bathroom and simply never invited anyone to visit; a boy with a voice that hadn\u2019t decided whether to crack or sing practiced a song under his breath and apologized for nothing. In Foc\u0219ani, her mother met her in the station like a soldier who had decided to greet peace with an argument. \u201cWhy are you so pale?\u201d she asked as if it were a bill. \u201cDo you eat? Do you sleep? You have the face of a saint that no one knows what to do with. Come. I made soup for eight hungry men. You are one.\u201d\n\nThe apartment had new curtains she had not asked permission to admire and a plant with leaves the size of someone\u2019s idea of tropical prosperity. Her mother fussed and then sat and then stood and then consented to sit properly, a choreography she would have disapproved of in any other woman. \u201cYour cousin says he saw you on the internet,\u201d she said, rolling the word as if tasting it for poison. \u201cHe says you have a shop where paper pretends to be something. He says your hair looks good and that you have lost weight, which is an insult disguised as admiration. I told him to send me the article and I read it and it made me cry because they wrote \u2018for the dead\u2019 as if the dead were waiting outside in the cold and you let them in. And also because the photo made you look like a person who stands with her feet apart as if expecting something to try her. Do not stand like that always. Your knees will ache.\u201d\n\nThey ate soup and then quince and then the biscuit that acted like a sponge and then, because sentiment insisted, they opened a box in the wardrobe where her mother kept the things she never let anyone believe she had. There were letters from an aunt who had married a man in Canada and discovered that the supermarket could cure certain homesickness and cause others, there was a small packet of paper birds folded by a neighbor with more patience than faith, and there were photographs of Ileana with hair in a fringe that had seemed, at the time, inconspicuous. Her mother pulled out a paper flower, flatter than it had intended to be, yellow dulled to the color of good butter. \u201cWe used these,\u201d she said, turning it over as if expecting medicine on the other side. \u201cWhen sugar was rationed, we decorated with flori din h\u00e2rtie, and when love was rationed we did not. I made them for your grandmother\u2019s icon, and then I stopped because your father called it ridiculous, and I cannot say he was wrong and I cannot forgive him. Eat more. You will find no forgiveness in your mother\u2019s kitchen.\u201d\n\nOn the train back, she wrote a list of things that had to be done before anyone could accuse her of optimism. Buy more tape. Replace kettle cord with a cord that had no interest in heroics. Sign the paper that would let Viorica sell tincture legally in the shop on Thursdays and that would demand eighty euros and a photostated signature from a man in a room over the police station. Teach the class at the institute and prevent the music man from insinuating a violin. Ask the tailor whether his son wanted to learn to cut crepe without frightening it. Ask Marius if it was too early in the year to plant sweet peas against the courtyard fence without insulting the wind.\n\nThe institute class took place in a room so white it reflected intentions back at you. A camera on a tripod watched, patient and unthreatening in the way of predators that prefer to depress rather than chase. Women came in wearing the kind of faces you wear when your salary depends on both delight and suspicion. Ileana demonstrated the cut that turned a flat petal into something that would catch light like a truth; she talked about wire as if it were behavior, and tape as if it could be forgiven for being green, and the room slowly forgot to be impressed with its own whiteness. A woman with a pen that had \u201cEU\u201d near its clip asked why paper and not silk, and Ileana made a joke that was kind and then did not. \u201cBecause of price,\u201d she said simply, \u201cand because my hands grew up with this and I do not need to become another woman to be good at it. Silk demands ceremonies I am done with. Paper is obedient and then suddenly not. It is like people.\u201d The camera caught her hand more honestly than it caught her mouth. Someone, somewhere, would cut the footage into a minute of sincerity for the internet. It didn\u2019t matter. Three women took scissors home and told themselves that a night could be shortened with cut fringe, and that mattered.\n\nOn a Friday that started with a hinge squeaking just to be dramatic, Luminita arrived flanked by two women from the market who wore indignation as if it were perfume gone sweet with age. \u201cThey want to raise the rent,\u201d she announced, and her bracelets hardly made a sound. \u201cThey say we bring nothing but litter and cheap hats. They say tourists get spooked. They would like us at the back by the shoes that are ashamed of themselves.\u201d She produced a notice printed on paper that had cost more than the thought behind it. \u201cSix months,\u201d she said, \u201cand then double. I told the man who told me that I would teach his wife to cut peonies with her nail, and he said he would prefer a raise.\u201d\n\nThe shop became a planning table with tea. Mara wrote on a piece of cardboard with a marker that had minded its cap, not slogans but lists of names\u2014each woman who would care, and each man who would have to be embarrassed into pretending care. Viorica told them which journalist accepted insults with grace and which one insisted you admire his hair before he would lift a pen. The teenager with the scar near his ear volunteered to bring his cousins and made it sound like muscle; the old woman with the white hair said she would come and sit and refuse to be moved and dared them to call the police on her with a look that would have made an ambulance apologize. \u201cWe will sell birds at the edge of their clean aisle,\u201d Ileana said, feeling the brief reheated anger that bureaucracy served, \u201cand we will price them so low that their receipts leak and so high that their eyes water, and we will be inconvenient and insist on it.\u201d\n\nThey were, and it worked in the way that such things work\u2014bluntly, imperfectly, expensively. A councilor whose face was a collection of courtesies appeared with his hands held just high enough to show he carried nothing; he promised a revision, a reconsideration, a respect. He said the word \u201cHeritage\u201d as if he were freighting it for the first time, and Viorica sniffed like a woman with a better dictionary. The notice that came two weeks later was thinner and more smug; it offered a smaller increase and the privilege of staying where they were if they learned to speak kindly about mops. It was victory edited into survival. Luminita took it, put it in her box under the green tape, and said, \u201cGood. I like fights that end with a joke. Next time, we will make a banner. Perhaps with fringe. They will die of laughter and we will count money.\u201d\n\nThe night they got the notice, a storm did the thing they had learned to expect and then it did something else. The lights went down on the entire block, and the usual chorus of complaints rose and then faltered because it was a clean dark, unpunished by sirens. The shop became a cave that had learned polite lighting: beeswax candles, the gold that makes people forgive one another. The birds, freed from the vanity of electricity, moved in a wind that appeared from nowhere and wrote shadows on the wall that looked like a language. A woman who had come to buy a violet stood and cried because she had been waiting to cry for five weeks and this felt like a room that could hold it. A boy found his mother\u2019s hand and was disgusted by himself and did not let go. Marius arrived with a lamp that had known tents and night watchmen and men who loved dogs more reliably than people, and he set it on the counter with the word he used for announcing events that had the decency to be simple. \u201cSnow,\u201d he said in March, and no one argued.\n\nShe bandaged his hand again when the lamp toasted it, an old intimacy made newer by the way he kept his palm open without asking for privacy. The scar on his wrist lay quiet in the candlelight. He looked at her with the expression he reserved for estimating if a branch would fall if asked, and then turned his head because he did not like to make people feel inspected. \u201cI will go to the market with you tomorrow,\u201d he said, which either meant he worried she would fight too hard or worried she would not fight hard enough, and she appreciated the ambiguity as a romance of its own. \u201cBring rope,\u201d he added, as if every situation could be improved by rope, and perhaps he was not wrong.\n\nApril threatened to become a drumroll and then remembered to stay rain. The plane tree put out buds like tiny truths. The hospital called for color because someone in purchasing had decided to allow joy as a line item. The institute sent a photograph of hands working and asked if they could use it in a program that would travel to a small town that believed itself untouched by trends and would welcome the arrival of a good one disguised as a class. The tailor returned with photographs of a baby and the faint panic of men who realize that time is not something they can negotiate with once, successfully, and then dismiss. He asked if paper birds were good luck in Spain; Ileana said yes in the tone that allowed a lie to become true in a room if told confidently.\n\nOne of the boys brought a football to the shop by mistake and saw it as a test of adulthood to pretend he had meant to. He kicked it against the wall and stopped when he saw a bird quiver. \u201cI did not see it,\u201d he said, outraged at gravity\u2019s presumption. \u201cIt did not see you,\u201d Marius answered, not unkindly. \u201cConsider that a peace.\u201d The boy nodded like a man who had come from a meeting and left with notes. He returned the next day with exact change for a single white bell and the face of someone who did not yet understand that buying beauty can be accompanied by the same concentration you use buying bread.\n\nIn between, there were the small stabbings the city administers to prevent complacency from getting uppity. A neighbor left a note about garbage in a handwriting that made the complaint seem older than paper, and then apologized for his own anger with a basket of tomatoes that had learned sweetness somewhere they did not care to admit. The internet argued with itself about whether paper flowers were betrayal or salvation, and Mara wrote replies for sport and then stopped because sport can outgrow pleasure in an afternoon. A woman came and demanded they make fifty red roses for a politician\u2019s wife who had the face of a person who despises mercy; Luminita accepted and priced them high enough to make the woman blink and then return with a compliment.\n\nThere were also gifts that pretended to be accidents. Viorica fainted, briefly, in the apothecary and woke up furious with her blood for attempting melodrama. \u201cI know what caused it,\u201d she said, calling Ileana later with the self-diagnosis of a woman who trusted her own pulse more than any machine. \u201cLack of sugar. And the sight of a man crying in my shop without discipline. We will pretend it is nothing and we will train the jars to be heavy at night so I do not carry them like a girl. Do not bring me pity. Bring me the rosemary with the strong stem. The one you bully.\u201d\n\nIleana brought rosemary and a new ledger because the old one had a spine that had begun to give in, and they wrote in it the simple things that lend dignity to trade: who owed what, who paid, who promised, who would not be asked again. Viorica wrote her name at the top with that neat aggression you associate with primary school teachers and good cooks. \u201cOne day,\u201d she said, matter-of-factly, as if describing the weather issuing from long-range forecast, \u201cI will leave this to someone who can count and will not sell sugar pills to women who need soup. It might be you. It might be the boy with the scar. It will not be the idiot with the blazer who believes in vitamins and nothing else. Do not argue. It is unbecoming.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo argument,\u201d Ileana said, though the thought of becoming apothecary made a small panicked bird in her chest flutter for the exit. \u201cBut do not hurry. The jars prefer you for now.\u201d\n\nEaster came with its eggs pretending to be new planets and its lamb pretending to be innocent. The church bells did the old trick of making the sky feel like a ceiling that had softened. People who resisted sermons came and accepted wax because they wanted to move in a crowd that pretended to know a song. The shop made wreaths with green that did not apologize to winter; they made birds that blushed on purpose; they made lilies that refused funerals for two weeks and then agreed to accompany them because society had to be humored. The old woman with the white hair brought a story about a priest who had tripped and made everyone laugh and forgiving him had saved them all the trouble of inventing love. \u201cDo not look put upon,\u201d she warned the young ones, wrists cocked, \u201cwhen joy asks for a lift. It is heavy and will sit on the floor if you do not insist.\u201d\n\nOne morning, as the river performed its party trick of holding a new sky in parts, a boy from the hospital came into the shop without his mother and with a dignity that refused to be narrated. He was fourteen; his eyes had learned a story that people ten years older told badly. \u201cThe lilies,\u201d he said, not trying to get sympathy with his mouth. \u201cThey helped my grandfather not hate the room.\u201d He coughed, a necessary punctuation. \u201cHe died yesterday, and my mother says she never wants to see them again and also can she keep one. I told her she is allowed both. She is at home and cannot speak to anyone yet. I would like to buy,\u201d he recited, like a sentence copied from a book that had saved him before, \u201cone that looks like it understands that I know two things at the same time.\u201d\n\nThey made him one that would look wrong in any photograph and perfect on a windowsill under a calendar with kittens. He paid with money folded so carefully it had learned new geometry. When he left, Luminita leaned against the counter and shook her hands as if shaking water off, a superstition to prevent feeling from sinking into the bone. \u201cWe do not deserve our jobs,\u201d she muttered to no one in particular and to half the saints on the wall. \u201cAnd yet here we are.\u201d\n\nOn a warm day that promised heat would be a problem again, the boys insisted on showing Marius the knot they had learned to tie on YouTube and that had convinced them that the internet deserved to exist. He watched, slowed it with his fingers, and taught them the other way, the one his grandfather had forced into his hands until it became preference. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, pressing the ends together and tugging, \u201cyou will forget this if you do not use it. Memory is lazy. Put it somewhere it will be forced to work.\u201d To her surprise, he turned to Ileana as if she were another boy with rope and not a woman who made a shop stay honest. \u201cYou are tying your days strangewise,\u201d he said. \u201cMake the loop bigger. Leave yourself a way out. You do not always have to be cleverer than the wind.\u201d\n\nShe nodded, not pretending to understand, and later, at the river, where the gulls had reclaimed their committee status and the taxis performed their mating rituals at the light, she understood. She wrote a list that was not a chain but a series of small generous instructions to herself: one window open; one day for the hospital without charging; one evening without numbers; one white bird for a neighbor whose voice had been rough with no excuse; one lunch eaten sitting down; one hour to watch steam; one call to her mother where she did not defend; one question to Marius that did not require an answer. She tucked the list under the magnet with the picture long gone and felt as if she had been given rope but not told to hang anything with it.\n\nThe day the inspector returned with a second clipboard and a new haircut, he found a class in session and Fleur-de-lis in progress and a woman telling a story about a favor that had, against the rules, been returned. He observed in silence for a minute, then made a note, then adjusted his tie as if to ask permission to speak. \u201cYou have become,\u201d he said gravely, as if awarding a medal, \u201ca place where my daughter is safe to say things I cannot hear in my kitchen. For this I will fine you less than the law allows for your plug. It would be a sin otherwise.\u201d He wrote the amount, which was rude and manageable, and left without taking a bird because the dignity he had retrieved after the first one now clung to him out of loyalty.\n\nBy the time the acacia remembered how to perfume a street without asking permission, they had made a habit of surviving. The shop had a broom that recognized only one corner as its weakness and leaned there between bouts; the scissors developed favorites among the hands that used them; the radio had been allowed in on Wednesdays when Mara\u2019s patience with her own smart jokes wore thin; the kettle grudgingly consented to a new cord and came to terms with a life that involved discipline. The building association surrendered, through neglect, to the trees. The gate and the hinge took the same measure of each other every evening and agreed to call it friendship. The dog learned to sleep where the sun moved. The D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba held the moon badly or brilliantly, depending on its own opinion that night. And on a Tuesday that was no one\u2019s birthday and everyone\u2019s, Ileana stood with her hands empty and then full, and said yes to a class that had asked nothing rude, and then no to a man who wanted to hang plastic, and then carried a pot of basil up the stairs, and thought, with the contentment that can only come from a day that obeyed no one and still turned out, that perhaps this was habit enough to be called a life.",

Ileana stooped over her balcony and counted\u2014out loud, if no one else was near\u2014the number of taxis that refused to stop at the crosswalk. Numbers steadied her. She could make lists until the coffee cooled. She could balance ledgers while thunder rolled. She had made a company out of a threadbare idea and an empty spare room, and sometimes when she forgot to breathe she would remember that, would hold it like a coin. But lately the numbers had been stubborn as nettles.\n\n\"Three shipments stuck, one client audibly breathing into my ear to intimidate me,\" she told the empty air and the one small rosemary bush that Marius had coaxed onto the sill. \"Singura veselie, rosemary is alive. Good. Bine.\"\n\nThe rosemary wavered. Below, the courtyard rattled with the sounds of buckets, hose, an old radio tuned to a station that played songs from the nineties and advertisements for paint. Marius had the kind of face that didn't reveal much unless he wanted it to. He wore a cap even in sun and a jacket through spring, and every day he swept the same arcs of dust as if they were lines he alone could see. He nodded when he sensed eyes on him\u2014not looking up, not exactly\u2014like an old horse. He had been hired by the building association and somehow ended up trusted with keys to lockers, boiler room, a shed where he stacked sapling stakes, old wires, sacks of gravel. People said he slept somewhere behind the tool wall when it rained.\n\nAt the corner of the kitchen table, Ileana's phone blinked with an email alert like a small heartbeat. Her investor, Sorin, had sent a message at midnight: we need to discuss direction. He always wrote like he was dictating to a mirror. The direction he wanted leaned toward importing cheaper things for faster money, whittling costs until the spine of the business snapped. She had resisted for months, and now they had their first true fight scheduled. She set the coffee down and decided there was no more delaying the tiny errand she'd invented for herself\u2014Obor market, just for twenty minutes, to buy three lemons and maybe something else. Something her hands could carry that wasn't a contract.\n\nOn the tram she stood, because everyone stood, men pretending they hadn't seen her, women with elbows sharper than knives. She watched the city blur and wished it would slow like breath. At the market's edge the air changed\u2014onions, fried dough, clatter\u2014and then she saw a table that made her stop, made everything inside her slow until the noise deferred. The table overflowed with flowers, but not flowers: paper\u2014crepe, tissue, streamers cut into fringes\u2014twisted and dyed into peonies, carnations, scraggly little daisies with yellow centers that were too cheerful to be real. The woman behind the table had bracelets up both arms. Her hair was threaded with ribbon; she had a missing tooth and the most patient eyes.\n\nIleana's fingers reached, ridiculous. One rose, deep red, curled like a tongue. She didn't touch it. She was thirty-six, she knew what a day ought to look like. Numbers. Lemon. Maybe cigarettes, if the stress convinced her into the old habit. Not paper roses.\n\n\"Frumoas\u0103, nu?\" the woman said, tipping her head. \"You can touch. They like it when you touch. Otherwise they think they are just fake, s\u0103racele.\"\n\n\"I didn't bring cash,\" Ileana lied, and then felt her wallet heavy in her bag. She didn't want to be pulled into a conversation. She didn't want to explain why she was paused here like a child at a circus window. \"Maybe next week.\"\n\n\"Next week they will be different.\" The woman pinched the edge of a petal and teased it outward until it cupped perfectly. \"Today they are this shape. Tomorrow they will be that shape. Because of your hands. Because of how you look at them.\"\n\n\"Soft sales pitch,\" Ileana said, and the woman laughed. It was a low, generous laugh that rolled between the stalls, scandalizing a fishmonger who had spent two hours arranging his sardines by angle. \"I'm sorry. I'm late.\"\n\n\"Five minutes,\" the woman said. \"I show you how to make one? Free. For your hands, yes? They are kind hands. I can see.\"\n\n\"I do logistics,\" Ileana said, and felt a strange flinch at how that sounded right then, a gray word in a place full of nail polish and frying oil and fruit. \"Between Constan\u021ba and... this.\" She drew a line in the air. \"I don't make. I order. I nag.\"\n\n\"You breathe,\" the woman said, unfazed. \"That's enough. Sit.\"\n\nIt was an insult to hurry past someone who had offered generosity so directly. Ileana sat on the rickety plastic chair and looked at the woman's hands. They were nicked, strong, motherly. \"I'm Luminita,\" she said, and pushed a wad of crepe paper at Ileana. \"Stretch it. Look. Not too much. It tears if you pull like you pull onto traffic on \u0218tefan cel Mare.\"\n\n\"I never\u2014\" Ileana started to protest, then laughed at the accuracy. Her hands obeyed the paper, making a saucer shape she didn't know she could make. Fold. Pinch. Twist wire. Turn slowly. She did as she was told. The petals formed without drama. A flower with inexact perfection\u2014hers\u2014looked up at her as if expecting to be named.\n\n\"You see?\" Luminita's bracelets clinked softly. \"Everyone thinks it's only for cemeteries. Or for some country wedding where the bride's uncle has money for a B-series but not for tulips. They say it's kitsch. They all say: h\u0103-h\u0103, paper. It can't breathe. They say a lot. But look.\" She held the flower up and turned it so the stall's shadow moved over it like a cloud. \"It catches the same light.\"\n\n\"It's beautiful.\" Ileana blurted it, surprised by the ring of truth, like a glass he had struck. \"It's\u2026 Not just beautiful. It feels like the thing stands in for time. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\"You talk like a woman who has argued for something until she forgot her own ears,\" Luminita said gently. \"Here. Take it. And if you want, Thursday night, a small class in the community room under the stadium. Ten lei. I will teach you to cut the fringe for peonies. Bring scissors that will forgive you.\"\n\n\"I have... I have meetings,\" Ileana said. \"I'm sorry. I...\"\n\n\"Your face says 'meetings' and your hands say 'petals.' Decide which one you listen to later.\" Luminita winked. \"Thursday we are there. If you come, you come.\"\n\nShe put the flower in her tote like a bottle bomb and forced herself to move, to buy lemons that suddenly looked anemic compared to the paper bloom, to contact a driver about a delivery, to avoid looking back. On the tram home she stuck her nose near the paper and inhaled. It smelled like dye and dust, nothing of rose, and yet her throat strained as if it might find sweetness. She shook her head, ashamed of the sentimentality, almost angry at herself for having been the kind of woman who could be kidnapped by red. It was twelve minutes of her life. She would forget.\n\nShe did not forget. That night, after the email exchange with Sorin turned flinty, after a client called to say that he had found a cheaper supplier in Poland and maybe they could talk next quarter, after her mother phoned from Foc\u0219ani to examine the holes in her life\u2014\"Thirty-six, Ileana. The neighbor's daughter has two children and a lavatory with marble. And you? Ansamblul t\u0103u? Apartments are expensive now. I saw on TV\"\u2014after all of that, she took the flower out of her bag and put it on the kitchen table. The kitchen light made the red deepen. It was a modest thing, glued, imperfect, stubborn.\n\n\"Well?\" she demanded of it, as if it were a negotiator. \"What?\"\n\nThe rosemary plant didn't answer. Neither did the flower. The silence made space. She opened her laptop and googled paper flowers, then crepe paper, then flori din h\u00e2rtie like she remembered from childhood, when she had watched her grandmother's neighbor, a Roma seamstress, make coin garlands and paper blossoms for funerals. You made a tree, they said, for the dead. You hung sweets and bright paper birds, and after the ceremony children tore them down and ran away with mouths sticky with ritual. She felt something in her chest tip.\n\nOn Thursday night she went.\n\nShe told herself it was research. Logistics of a different product. She told herself she would be in the building for twenty minutes, and then she would dash to a late dinner with a client who needed handholding. She told herself she was not the kind of person who was swayed by small wonders. She told herself many things and carried her grandmother's old sewing scissors in her bag like talisman. The community room smelled of rain and old gym shoes. Luminita had dragged in folding tables and her box of paper, and four other women already sat, arms crossed, daring themselves not to cry.\n\n\"We don't have to be sentimental,\" Luminita said, as if she'd heard every thought. \"We can make peonies and curse our exes and pay attention. That's enough.\"\n\nThey cut. They fringe-cut everything. Tissue into streamers, streamers into fringes so fine they stuck to their lips. They rolled and twisted and slid stems into green tape. Luminita kept repeating her one instruction\u2014breathe, breathe\u2014and when the tips of Ileana's fingers stained pink, she felt something like mercy. There was accomplishment that didn't involve a delivery window, a discount, a signature, a power suit. There was shape made out of flatness. Inside the bloom, she could see wrinkles she'd left like fingerprints.\n\n\"I used to do nails,\" a woman across the table announced, unwinding a ribbon of white. \"People looked at their phones the whole time. I thought: no more. These, they look back at you. They don't blink.\"\n\n\"At my wedding,\" said another, \"my husband's aunt put paper flowers in the icons. My grandmother said it was a bad sign.\" She shrugged. \"Thirty years and a mortgage later, I think she was wrong.\"\n\n\"I make them for graves too,\" Luminita said without flinching. \"I don't think it's bad. I think people need a color that doesn't leave them the next day.\"\n\nWhen Ileana got home, past eleven, Marius was closing the courtyard shed, the last thing he did before disappearing into whatever his life was. He smelled like wet leaves and cigarette smoke and the sharp tin of the old radio. The hose lay coiled like a sleeping snake. He nodded when he heard her step, as if he had known the pattern of her shoes for months.\n\n\"Is that paper?\" he asked, pointing with his chin at the bouquet peeking from her bag.\n\n\"It is,\" she said. \"Apparently I am twelve years old again.\"\n\n\"No. When we were little,\" he said, unusually talkative, \"my mother made them for parastas. For forty days, for a year. People laughed too. They said, why not real roses? She did both. She said the paper ones don't ask for water. The dead like things that don't ask.\" He looked away at nothing, at the oleanders that never flowered in Bucharest because someone always forgot to bring them inside for winter. \"We had a dog that used to steal one and run. He loved the wire. He thought it was a stick that fought back.\"\n\n\"You know how to make them?\"\n\n\"I know how to hold them,\" he said. His voice had that flatness that turned all statements into fact. \"And I know the wind that blows here. By morning if you leave them out they\u2019ll be in the gutter. The kids play football. They won't see. If you like them, keep them inside. People mistake carelessness for malice.\"\n\n\"I always do,\" she said, surprised that truth had slid out. Maybe it was the hour. \"I always think the missed call means someone hates me.\"\n\n\"You are not so important.\" He said it without meanness, and it stabbed then soothed. \"No one has time to hate you. They only forget. This is better. I like the red.\"\n\nUpstairs, she arranged them in a glass jar because she didn't own a proper vase. The old jar had a label half-peeled, and the glue was gummy under her thumb. She put the arrangement on her desk where, in the morning, it would catch the window's pale. She slept as if the entire day had not been made of sand.\n\nThe morning did not honor her with ease. Sorin arrived at the office with his expensive sad smile and the kind of cologne that left the room ten minutes after he did. He moved chair legs, looked at the flower jar, and chuckled.\n\n\"What are we selling now,\" he said, \"whimsy?\"\n\n\"Don't start,\" Ileana said, hating how small she sounded. \"They're a\u2014present.\"\n\n\"We need to talk margins,\" he said, as if the jar had not been there. \"We need to talk pivot, Ileana.\"\n\n\"I am bone-tired of your words,\" she snapped. \"Pivot. Synergy. The thing you want me to do is also simple to say: cheap. And I can't be that. Not now.\"\n\n\"We can be out,\" he said, looking toward the window the way he always did when he wanted to make an exit sound like an offer. \"Sell the last containers, pay off what we can, let it all set. There is a health products distributor that's buying. They are expanding. Supplements, tinctures. If we\u2014\"\n\n\"Do I look like a woman who can sleep if she gives up?\" she said. The flower in her eye's corner soothed nothing, couldn't even be used as a shield. \"Don't talk to me about health products. I have eaten crackers for dinner all week. I don't want to sell gel caps.\"\n\n\"You are sentimental lately,\" Sorin laughed, and it wasn't kind. \"Is there a man? Is there a\u2014\"\n\n\"Get out,\" she said, very softly. \"Please. Or drop it. We can argue later. Today I need to live out my day and not make a permanent decision that will make me disappointed in myself for five years.\"\n\nHe threw up his hands and gave her three hours, a mercy he would later charge her for. She sat, pressed her fingers between her eyes until little stars burst there, and let numbers line up like soldiers. She emailed and re-emailed. She told herself, when the room dimmed, that she was holding. For now.\n\nHer assistant, Mara, who was twenty-seven and never wasted feelings on things she could fix with sarcasm, leaned in with a box of staples and the look people wear when they're about to tell you a story you didn't consent to hear. \"My cousin saw you at Obor,\" she said. \"She said you were sitting with a woman who sells those tacky flowers. Her words, not mine.\" Mara put the staples down and rolled her eyes at the jar. \"My grandmother used to say paper flowers are either for brothels or for the cemetery. Choose your clientele.\"\n\n\"We have such a rich heritage,\" Ileana said dryly. \"Why are we even in the European Union? We have proverbs. We're full of advice.\"\n\n\"Tissue paper gives me hives,\" Mara said. \"Don't ask me why. You're allowed your eccentricities. Better paper than cats.\"\n\nThe teasing was kinder than the laugh had been. Even so, by lunch, Ileana hid the jar under her desk as if it were contraband. She walked to Baker's on the corner and ate a pretzel she didn't taste. Outside, a man with string-straight hair asked her for a cigarette, and she shook her head. On the way back a poster slapped the side of a bus: a baby smiling down at a bottle of cough syrup. The word \"homeopathy\" shrank and enlarged as the bus moved. It was a word she'd only thrown at in conversation as a joke, a reflex of skepticism. Water with a memory. She had pointed and laughed. But there it was, blue letters you could almost lean on, and something in her remembered her grandmother's cupboard full of tinctures with all the labels written by hand. After a fever, a drop under the tongue, the swell of sleep like wind under a kite.\n\n\"Don't be ridiculous,\" she told herself, hearing Mara's eye roll in her head. \"You are not going to go into sugar pills. You are not going to be a witch.\" Still, when she got home she typed the word into the search bar, then erased it, then retyped it and fell into the rabbit hole of cure-alls and quacks and earnest believers and studies with sample sizes so small you could hold them in a palm. It didn't matter. It was the feeling that did. The feeling that there might exist a way to help, however flawed, that wasn't spreadsheets or ports or Sorin's talk.\n\nOn Saturday, when she carried a paper bouquet to her friend Anca's daughter's birthday party, she did it with shame hot on her cheeks. She had never been embarrassed about taste; she had never been the woman who brought the wrong thing. But it was raining and the party was in a two-room flat in Militari, and Anca's mother came to the door with her hair wrapped in a towel and took the bouquet like it was a stranger who might steal silver. Inside, the children screamed at a purple-clad clown, sugar staining their teeth, and a woman by the window whispered \"mamaie, look, paper\" like an insult. The room coughed out a laugh. Anca hugged her and whispered, \"It's perfect,\" fierce enough to make Ileana believe it for a flicker, and then and then they put the bouquet near the TV, and the fourth child to have a balloon popped cried, and the clown tried to do magic with a coin. The paper flowers didn't wilt. Something about their stubbornness disturbed Ileana. She wanted them to be tender enough to fail.\n\nOn the way out it had stopped raining, the pavement spreading silver underfoot. In the courtyard of her building Marius was puzzling over the hinge on the big iron gate, throwing his weight against it in frustrated increments. \"It moans like a sick thing,\" he grunted.\n\n\"It sings like an opera,\" she said, because she couldn't manage a complaint. \"I brought you a piece of cake. Made of butter and regret.\"\n\n\"Regret is my favorite,\" he said without smiling, accepting the plastic plate. \"You look angry.\"\n\n\"I hate when people whisper. It's like gnats. Too small to squash. Do you know what I mean?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, and for perhaps the first time since she had met him, his face shifted, as if the underneath had moved. \"I do.\"\n\nIn the next week, small things turned and turned. An email thread that had been anemic warmed. A client returned, sheepish, because Poland hadn't sent what they promised. \"Fine,\" she wrote back, and then deleted the word \"fine\" because it felt like she was forgiving. She allowed herself coffee at noon. She let her phone ring without pouncing. She told Sorin she would meet him for a last talk at a cafe with walls painted dark as licorice. For the first time, she offered him a choice: buy her out or let her buy him. He was so surprised he did not speak for seconds. That seemed like progress.\n\nOn Thursday, her hands full of crepe forests, she walked out of Luminita's class and into the kind of evening Bucharest sometimes produced like an apology. The clouds had thinned enough to let bruised light through, and above the stadium's concrete, swifts reeled as if someone had shaken the sky. On the tram she stood again, pressed to the door by a suited man who breathed like a bull, and watched a boy of ten press his forehead to the window to fog it. He wrote a word into the fog. It was a name. The girl next to him blushed and pushed him in the arm and then wrote, below it, a small flower. The petals were lopsided. It was not exactly pretty. It was the best thing Ileana had seen all week.\n\nShe slept badly\u2014thunder took a giant step across the city\u2014and in the morning she went down to the courtyard early because she had left something in her car and also because she wanted air. Marius was there in the gray, tying a sapling to a stake with soft pantyhose strips. He had a cigarette stuck to the side of his mouth. He looked like he had been awake too long.\n\n\"These,\" he said without preamble, tapping the nail on the stake, \"are too thin. They will snap when the wind decides to come for real. I'll find better.\"\n\n\"Does the wind ask your permission?\" she teased, and then swallowed it. There was something in him today. A tension in the hand. The radio was off. The gate was ajar. A stray dog slept under the bench with its belly up like a question.\n\n\"Sometimes it does,\" he said. \"If you know its name.\"\n\n\"Come to the market with me this weekend,\" she said impulsively. \"We can buy better stakes. And\u2014no, sorry, I don't usually. Ask people to spend Saturday with me.\"\n\nHe looked at her as if she had said something very strange. Then he nodded once. \"Also we buy wire. Not the soft one that twists like sugar. The real one, with a bite. For your flowers.\" His face had gone unreadable again.\n\nNo one had asked her about her flowers as if they were anything other than hobby, as if she might require a better grade of supplies. It pierced her. \"Yes,\" she managed. \"For those.\"\n\nAt the market, he moved like a man who had directions from a map inside his bones, even though Ileana had never seen him out of the courtyard. They walked past stalls selling shoes that looked embarrassed to be shoes, past a table of cabbage pyramids so precise you could have split a hair with the lines between leaves. A vendor in a denim vest asked Marius if he wanted to bet on a fight; he ignored him. He chose wire with the way he chose his words: only when necessary; no ornament. Ileana bought paper in colors she had no names for. At Luminita's stall, the teacher pretended not to see Marius until he tipped his cap and then she laughed like a shout.\n\n\"Eh, Marius,\" she said. \"Look at you. Still choosing the straightest staves. Leave the girl the curved ones. It makes prettier stems.\"\n\n\"You know each other?\" Ileana asked, startled.\n\n\"Of course,\" Luminita said easily, using her chin to pry open a new box of green tape. \"He used to bring his mother here. She would sit and I would take her lists and sometimes she would buy nothing, only talk. She had a back that hurt like winter. She told good jokes. You still tell her jokes?\"\n\n\"They were hers,\" he said, and that was that. There was a small silence in which the market seemed to breathe. Then Luminita thrust an extra roll of crepe into Ileana's bag. \"For luck,\" she said, as if luck were a material you could lay by, if you were sensible enough to carry the right bag.\n\nBack in the courtyard, they cut the stakes, and Marius hammered them into the dirt as if killing something invisible. He sweat, but he didn't remove the jacket. He had a scar on his wrist that looked like river-lace. She wanted to ask him where it came from, but she also wanted to keep living in a place where not everything had to be answered at once. Instead she handed him slices of bread with olive paste that she had made at midnight with a spoon and a small sort of fury.\n\n\"My father said paper flowers were for girls who cried too much,\" she said, as if she were commenting on weather. \"I think maybe I am done taking orders from ghosts.\"\n\n\"You could be careful,\" he said, turning his face upward to judge the way the wind recorded itself in the pine tips. \"People like to run their mouths. They can be\u2026 It is not only laughter. It can cut. You pretend not to bleed and then at night. And then at night.\"\n\n\"And then?\" she asked, and he shook his head, finished his slice, put the plate on the bench, and something in him closed like the shed door, tidy, final.\n\nThat evening the building association had one of its meetings in the ground-floor hallway, which smelled of damp and a neighbor's onion soup. C\u0103t\u0103lin, who had moved in three months ago with a white toothbrush and a plan to buy the whole block if his imagination allowed, brought printouts with colored graphs. He wanted to cut down the courtyard trees because \"roots are disruptive\" and because \"shade makes mold.\" He wanted to pave. He wanted to add parking. He wanted, mostly, to see himself reflected in a glazed surface.\n\n\"Do we want more dust?\" Ileana said, surprising herself with the force of her voice. \"More heat? We already breath in cement. I like to see birds that are not pigeons. Is that so frivolous? Are we\u2014\"\n\n\"Ah,\" C\u0103t\u0103lin said, in the tone that had prompted boys to fight him in school but which his shoulders had allowed him to avoid, \"the lady with the... the craft. How sweet. Perhaps we could hang your paper bouquets from the lampposts in the new parking lot. Artisanal.\"\n\n\"Or we could plant geraniums,\" she said. \"Those red ones you like when it is the election.\" Laughter tipped toward her, then away when his face soured. People were cowards; she didn't blame them. Their mortgages were knives they kept in their pockets.\n\nMarius stood at the edge of the gathering, his hands behind his back, his chin tilted in a way that wasn't quite defiant. He did not speak. He did not have to; he had a way of standing that made lawyers and men like C\u0103t\u0103lin push their voices harder, as if they must make something happen to justify themselves. In the end, they voted to do nothing, to \"revisit in six months\" which was to say, to let time decide or to let something quieter find them. It fascinated her\u2014that sometimes the bravest action was to refuse action, to sit in the weeds with your throat quiet and your hands closed around a thing you did not want to relinquish.\n\nAfterwards, she found him at the gate, fitting a piece of rubber into the hinge so the moan softened. \"You did not speak,\" she said.\n\n\"I am the gardener,\" he said. It was the first time she had heard him call himself that. \"They think my vote is leaves. I save my speech for other uses.\"\n\n\"What uses?\"\n\n\"For the day when someone wants to hurt something I can put my body in front of,\" he said, still in that flat tone, and for the first time since she'd known him, a glint of steel showed under the dirt. It frightened and thrilled her to see it.\n\nThe next weeks slipped, but not away. Mara came in with allergies and left with a bouquet that made her sneeze less. \"It's like it scares the pollen,\" she said, amazed. Anca sent a photo of her daughter holding the red rose like a microphone. Luminita introduced a new student at class, a man with hands that shook and eyes that had seen too many dawns.\n\n\"People laugh at you?\" he asked Ileana, when she offered him the green tape like communion.\n\n\"They have always laughed at me,\" she said, smiling, \"for one reason or another. I am a factory of reasons.\"\n\n\"Then we are three,\" he said, and pointed to himself, to the paper in his hand, to the evening spread flat outside the window like a sheet. They bent their heads together over a center of wire and glue and breath.\n\nHer mother phoned again on a Sunday when television shows hurt the air. \"Your cousin Costel says he saw you at the market,\" she announced, as if presenting a nurse with a fever chart. \"He says you were buying carnival supplies. Are you having midlife crisis?\"\n\n\"I am having my life,\" Ileana said, washing strawberries one by one. \"Mami. I am having it.\"\n\n\"What if you get a virus from those papers? They come from somewhere dirty. China. I'm joking, don't start. Listen. The neighbor's daughter. Marble. It's... no, I will not go into it again. Listen, they put sugar in everything, what do I know.\"\n\n\"I'm practicing being wrong,\" Ileana said, lightly now. \"It warms me at night.\"\n\n\"You joke too much,\" her mother sighed. \"Make the sign of the cross. Say a psalm. Be serious one day.\"\n\nWhen they met, Sorin tried to charm her out of the mood she had set like a table. He failed, because she did not reciprocate, and charm needs a second to matter. In the end, there was a document. There was the signature he thought she would not be brave enough to ask for. There was the way the air in the cafe felt different after it was done\u2014thinner, full of particles, as if she could hear her own lungs. She hid in the bathroom for a minute, two, because she had trained herself to leave rooms before she cried. She didn't. She splashed water on her face like every actress in a show, and then she laughed at herself there, in the tarnished mirror.\n\nWhen she came out the day's light had turned gold like a trinket. She walked home the long way, past an old apothecary with green-painted shelves and brown bottles with Latin names that pretended they knew more than they did. The woman behind the counter scowled. \"We close in five,\" she said. \"If you want something, be quick.\"\n\n\"I don't know what I want,\" Ileana said honestly, as if the apothecary could spare the time to solve more than a headache.\n\n\"Then you're not buying,\" the woman said, but her mouth's corner betrayed her, a small kindness. \"Try tomorrow. At least bring me a problem to solve. I hate tourists.\"\n\nShe went to sleep with the crepe paper folded at the foot of her bed like extra sheets. It softened the night. She dreamed a tree with white birds sitting where the leaves would be, and in the dream she could not tell if the birds were alive or made of paper, and it didn't matter because the tree hummed as if it wanted for nothing.\n\nIn the dark morning the air felt wrong. She knew it as she poured coffee. The trams sounded louder. The neighbor's dog didn't bark. Even the rosemary did not look pleated with life. On the stairs on her way down she met an older woman she had never seen in her life; the woman wore a sweater buttoned in the wrong order and gave Ileana the solemn nod you might give someone in a waiting room.\n\nAt the bottom of the stairs, the courtyard was empty in a way that emptied her. The gate was ajar, but not for air. The radio was on but low, as if someone had placed a hand over its mouth. And there was Marius, sitting on the bench, both hands on his knees like a man waiting for judgment. The stray dog lay under his feet, eyes on him, a guard who didn't know what to guard.\n\n\"What?\" Ileana said, not whispering because whispering would make it too real. \"Is something wrong? Are you\u2014\" She stopped. The air was wrong because something had happened. It hadn't happened to her. It was in the smell of condensing breath above dirt. It was in the way the buildings seemed to lean.\n\nMarius looked up at her, and for once his face showed something and did not hide it fast enough. He looked like a man who had done something that could not be undone. He looked like the hinge of the gate, metal cracking around a hole, not yet broken, giving.\n\n\"Later,\" he said, and she heard the word fold as if loaded with wet. \"Later I will ask you if you can make something white.\"\n\nShe sat beside him without touching. The dog put its chin on her shoe and exhaled as if explaining something to her patiently, in a language she should have known. The old radio murmured to itself. The plants were just plants. They stood. They did not know that anything had changed. That was the cruelty and the blessing.\n\n\"I have a class,\" she said, to say anything.\n\n\"You're learning to make petals,\" he said. There was nothing mocking in it. \"Good. Learn.\"\n\nShe sat with him until the concierge began to rattle keys and unlock doors and the city's noise slipped back into place like a coin into a slot. She went upstairs and washed her hands twice, as if guilt were a smell. She returned to the table and looked at the red rose in the jar, which had started to lean like an old man. She took it out and rewrapped the base with stronger tape, then made a note in a small notebook: better wire. She wrote it three times, as if the insistence could keep anything upright that wanted very much to fall.\n\nWhen she finally went to class, late, Luminita looked at her with that slow, telling gaze that had undone her at Obor. \"We make white today,\" she said, simply, and started to teach them the kind of flowers you took into quiet places where people sat with their hands between their knees and listened to the air working hard.\n\nOn the way home, she walked past the apothecary, and this time she went in. The woman behind the counter recognized her enough to soften. \"Today?\" she said.\n\n\"Today I bring a problem,\" Ileana said. \"I don't know if it can be solved with anything you have. But I want to learn names. Of herbs. Of drops. Of anything that helps. Even if it is only a story. I can pay for good stories.\"\n\n\"Sometimes stories are the only things we have to fill our bottles,\" the woman said, reaching for a ledger. \"Start with chamomile. For sleep. For the first night after. Then we talk again.\"\n\nThat night, she put the chamomile under her tongue as if it were a truth. She sat with her scissors threatening silence. She finished three white carnations that were not perfect and looked exactly like the thing she could offer. And the next morning, when she went down, Marius had not slept. He was there, his cap on the bench beside him, the dog under the bench, the gate's hinge quiet. He looked at the white flowers as if they were offering him a kind of grammar. He did not ask questions. She did not tell him a thing. There were other voices for that. But when he stood, the weight he carried made sense in the way that gravity makes sense: not fair, not kind, only true.\n\n\"You have good hands,\" he said, unpracticed gratitude. \"They make order out of\u2014\"\n\n\"Paper,\" she said. \"I make order out of paper.\"\n\n\"It is more than paper,\" he said, and then looked past her, toward the street, toward a siren that had decided to hesitate at the corner, as if waiting for permission, and toward a morning that had already started to break over its own bleeding edge.",

The wind prodded bits of ash off the water, and a plastic bottle moved like a small, stubborn animal. Ileana watched the river while coffee sought its level in the mug. She thought of how, as a child, she had believed the river was a ribbon that someone might pick up and shake to get the city to behave. The thought made her smile in that dry, private way she had when she wanted to test herself for softness. She took her notebook and wrote a list of things that might be needed when someone died, surprising herself with the neatness of her handwriting: candles, sugar cubes, plastic cups, napkins, coffee, coliv\u0103, towels, black scarves, paper icons, matches. She added to the list: white. She closed the notebook and felt, in her capable way, that making a list was a small way of putting a sheet over something you didn't yet have the strength to look at.\n\nWhen she reached the courtyard, the bench held the shape of someone who'd sat a long time and gotten up carefully. The stray dog had claimed the sliver of sun on the concrete and was playing at sleep, one ear cocked like a radio antenna. The gate's hinge had been tamed to a purr. Marius was not there, but the hose lay rolled with military attention, and a plastic bag of bread heels hung from the nail where he left things for the pigeons when he didn't feel like tolerating their greed. On the noticeboard where the association posted its threats about overdue fees, someone had pinned a black ribbon under a handwritten name: Maria G. No dates. People were always stingy with the dates, as if the numbers would make the loss expire faster. Ileana stood with her hands flat on the cool mailbox metal. She whispered, because there was no one to overhear and because saying a thing out loud sometimes lodged it properly in the throat: Dumnezeu s-o ierte.\n\nShe meant to go upstairs and sit on her hands until they admitted what they wanted to do, but instead she found her feet performing a memory she didn't know she had. She walked to the apothecary with the mean-faced woman and bought a stack of beeswax candles that smelled faintly of smoked apples. She went to the supermarket and bought bad coffee that made better coffee taste like mercy, sugar by the kilo, napkins with flowers printed in a red too cheerful for the occasion. She texted Luminita: need white, many, quickly, can we do pom? Luminita wrote back: come, I have wire and patience. She texted Marius with her usual reluctance to cross a line. He answered nothing and then a single word: later. The word had become a bridge; she didn't mind crossing it without knowing what stood on the other side.\n\nAt the market, Luminita had set her table differently, a small act that made the regulars glance and then look away. The reds and ultraviolet candies of last week were gone, replaced with creams and whites and the faint powder blue that old grievers liked, because they remembered the glaze of the Madonna in their grandmother's kitchen. Luminita had brought in her daughter-in-law to help, a woman with a braid like a thick rope who laughed under her breath when the taxi drivers made jokes that were so tired even the pigeons didn't bother to turn their heads. They cut circles and ovals, they tore strips, they stamped fringes so fine they whispered. Ileana's hands remembered to breathe before she did. The paper lifted under her thumbs as if it wanted to become what she wanted. It felt indecent, to be given so much obedience by a flat thing.\n\n\"You have mother's hands today,\" Luminita observed without sentiment, as if she were remarking on the weather. \"Not in the sense of babies. In the sense of care. Put that into the wire. It holds.\"\n\n\"His mother,\" Ileana said, to see what the words did out in the air. \"I met her without meeting.\"\n\n\"She liked to watch the pigeons chew without swallowing,\" Luminita said. \"She said, see, even birds get drunk on plenty. She faked a limp one year to get out of going to some cousin's wedding in Pantelimon. She hated the way people looked at her pain like it was an anecdote. I liked her. I told her finally that the limp was an absurdity. She said, I know, but it helps me gods and neighbors equally. Hold the tape closer. Your stems are loose.\"\n\nThey worked without explaining to anyone else what they were doing. They made lilies that looked less like lilies and more like the idea that lilies wanted to preserve of themselves. They made crepe bells that would clink with the slightest wind. The pom they began to build was a small tree of wire and decency; it would be dressed with apples polished until they wore the faces of ten people; it would hold pretzels threaded with red string, money pinned in the old-fashioned way to paper leaves with the heads of dead kings looking off into a better distance. Ileana had a superstition about doing things right when it mattered; she imagined ghosts took notes the way professors did, head tilted, pencil held lightly, patient with you up to a point and then not patient at all.\n\nWhen she carried the first armful of white through the courtyard, the dog got up and followed her like a senior usher. Men she had only ever known as men with cigarettes and pilled sweaters came forward to take the bags without cheerful talk. In the stairwell, someone had scrubbed the graffiti off the landing without any announcement or threat against future graffiti; it shone, for once, like a clean thought. The elevator had an out-of-order sign in handwriting that looked like a child's, and beneath it someone had drawn a cross with equal arms, as if God could be balanced by care.\n\nThe apartment where death had arrived wore no special costume. It smelled of boiled potatoes and ironed shirts. The curtains were pulled halfway, as if compromise could still be brokered with light. In the front room, the table kidneyed against a wall held the framed photograph that would stand in for a presence that had gone elsewhere. A young woman in a summer dress, a boy next to her making a serious face like men do when they think a camera is also a question. Ears that were not shy about themselves, a mouth that had decided early to be kind and had suffered for it in the small ways only kindness measures.\n\nMarius was taller in that room. Grief steels a spine in a way that makes it look like someone else's. He nodded at her, and the gesture gave her permission to move. She unwrapped the flowers, counting without thinking\u2014twelve, twenty, thirty\u2014and set them in the places where, by custom, roses might have gone if money had wanted to brag. An auntly neighbor crossed herself and said, softly, \"Paper? Eh, well. Better than nothing.\" Another woman, toes in folded sandals, touched one of the white bells the way you test a bruise. \"They keep,\" she said, and then looked embarrassed to have said it like a compliment.\n\nWhen they brought in the pom and dressed it with apples and small packages of biscuits and sugar, someone began to tell stories. It begins like that in rooms where the Christian calendar bends the day into meaning even when the city outside refuses to. A man tried to make a joke and failed and then cried into his fist, ashamed of the water. The priest came and went, leaving the smell of wax and a corridor of words through which the neighbors moved, order restored by syllables no one pretended to fully understand. Ileana found herself pouring coffee like a waitress, counting cups, rolling sugar between her fingers to keep from wringing her hands. Her own mother would have approved of her competence and scolded her for her pride in it.\n\nMarius did not speak until late, when the room had settled into the murmur of women who were not done saying what needed to be said and men who had run out of acceptable places to put their hands. He stood next to the pom as if it had become a close friend. He touched a paper petal and made no show of it. \"She liked white,\" he said, as if to the tree. \"She kept a tablecloth folded under the other tablecloths, for when the right guest came. She said maybe no one is the right guest, but perhaps the impulse is enough. \u015ei cu asta\u2026 That\u2019s life.\" He looked at the photograph and did not look back for a while.\n\nIleana edged closer only to ask, quietly, whether he wanted her to take the pom to the cemetery or leave it for the forty days, a question she only knew to ask because she had sat in rooms with her grandmother when someone went and a pine plank made the table longer. He glanced at her mouth, not her eyes, and said, \"Forty. Children will come. Good. Let them pull. Let them learn to want with their hands. The apples we give away. The paper we can keep. The dog will eat the pretzels if we leave him alone five minutes.\"\n\nAfter the neighbors drifted and the last ring of coffee cups clinked into the sink, she went home and slept with the smell of candles in her hair. She dreamed of a white room with a window that looked not over the city but over a field where wind kept turning the tall grass like a great hand. In the morning her nose stung as if she had cried, though she was not entirely sure she had. She made a list of tasks that had nothing to do with death, because life required that you give it equal time even when it was rude.\n\nAt the office, Mara had lined up invoices with the efficiency of a bored cat arranging trophies. \"We have Belgium back,\" she announced as if returning a loaned coat. \"Poland sent them shoes that were left-right-left. Also, Sorin wrote three emails in a row with the words 'final offer' in them. I ignored the first two. The third came with a smiley face, so I wrote a paragraph about compliance and attached a photo of a baby goat. He hasn't answered.\"\n\n\"I signed,\" Ileana said, and the word went out into the room like a bird that wasn't sure it wanted to leave. \"This week. It's done.\"\n\nMara blinked and then whistled; her respect had always presented itself as irony, but now something else stood behind it, a steadiness that she rarely showed. \"So it's you alone. Congratulations or condolences?\"\n\n\"Both,\" Ileana admitted. \"We owe less than we fear and more than we like. But if I fail, it will be mine. I think I wanted that. I think I was tired of being asked to arrange myself around another person's idea of profit.\"\n\n\"Look at you,\" Mara said, tipping her chin toward the jar on the shelf, where two white bells had migrated overnight as if the flowers traveled in sleep. \"With your crafts and your kingdom. Try not to pay salaries with peonies.\"\n\n\"I can pay salaries with the things peonies taught me,\" Ileana said, surprising herself. She sat and wrote three emails that would either save the month or burden it. Then she opened the spreadsheet with the column that always made her stomach climb her spine, and she looked at it until the numbers behaved.\n\nOn a slow afternoon, when the city dozed in its own heat and the office fan hummed like a plain song, she walked back to the apothecary. The woman behind the counter wore a new blouse with daisies embroidered at the neck; the daisies were uneven, which made Ileana like them more. \"Today,\" the woman said, before being asked, \"you need linden. And a small bottle of valerian if you are not offended by the smell of old socks. It helps when sleep curls under the bed and refuses to come out.\"\n\n\"I am learning to name things,\" Ileana said. \"Chamomile. Tei. Sun\u0103toare. I want to be careful, not become one of those women who sprinkle drops and think it absolves them of kindness. I want to know what is story and what is sap.\"\n\nThe woman snorted, amused. \"You are a rare bird. Most people come here to buy a license for their panic. They want religion in vials. I can provide tea and a scolding. The rest is between you and your breath.\"\n\n\"Do you ever sell the little white pills?\" Ileana asked, and braced, not for the answer but for the argument.\n\n\"I sell anything that won't harm and might persuade,\" the woman said with a weary pragmatism that Ileana admired. \"If a man sleeps because he believes in sugar with a job, I will not wake him to instruct him. Bring me your problems with borders. The ones with no edges are for another shop. Or for the priest. Or for your paper.\"\n\nThe days filled with the kind of work that, if written on a calendar, looked like a list of small defeats and small mercies. She learned to nod differently when clients threatened to leave; the nod said, that is your choice, and also, I am not terrified of it. She rewrote a contract to fit the truth rather than the hope. She calculated how many bouquets of paper peonies would equal one container's profit and then laughed at herself for the stupidity of the math and then recalculated because sometimes foolish exercises teach you where your stubbornness hides. She took three orders for corporate gifts; a law firm wanted white lilies for their conference room, because irony entertained them; a nursing home wanted pink carnations, because the residents had opinions about roses that went back to a summer in '78 and who was worthy of them; a wedding planner called to tell her paper was out and plastic in, and Ileana said \"no thank you\" and hung up with a satisfaction she hadn't known two months ago she could afford.\n\nMarius began to appear at the edges of her days like a drawing that water hadn't washed away. He raked the courtyard with a meticulousness that turned the long strips of fallen plane-tree bark into sentences. He replaced the hinges on the shed door and sanded them lightly, the sound like a cricket that had finally learned to speak softly. He asked her twice to show him how to twist the wire for a certain kind of petal, then left without a word when she fumbled and laughed at herself. He leaned against the gate one late afternoon and told her, in his flat voice that made all experiences sound equal, that the priest had gotten the story of his mother's birthdate wrong twice and that the knitted socks had been too tight on her feet in the casket, and that he had loosened them and felt a shame he did not recognize. Ileana listened the way she had listened to her grandmother when the stories were in danger of ending not with a moral but with a mistake. She did not apologize for the universe. She offered him a piece of sugar and watched him put it in his mouth as if it were medicine.\n\nThe building association, terrified of the momentum created by small groups of people who had felt something together, called another meeting. C\u0103t\u0103lin came with a new stack of proposals: a painting of a parking lot so sleek it looked like a bathroom. He had switched products on them and now sold efficiency dressed as progress. \"Trees,\" he said, with the patronizing tone he believed made him intelligible, \"harbor insects. Children are bitten. People have allergies. We have to consider the quality of life.\"\n\n\"You don't get to define life for us,\" an old woman said from the back, and the voice was so fierce that everyone turned. She was bent, a little, like someone's prized birch. Her hair was the white of a noise that makes you fall asleep. \"I have lived with insects and without. I prefer with. At least they mind their business.\"\n\n\"I can find a compromise,\" Ileana said, because she had not let go of the idea that a clever document might save a tree. \"We can cut what is sick. We can plant under the windows that have mold. We can\u2026\" She saw Marius watching the top of the nearest pine as if it were a radio station in a storm. She saw him not speaking because he was saving the words for when the words had the right value.\n\n\"We can wait,\" Marius said, finally. He did not raise his voice. He did not move. \"Wind comes. It tells you which branches want to break. We cut those, and only those. You do not pave over wind. It refuses. It comes back through the cracks.\"\n\nThe silence that followed sounded, in Ileana's ear, like a kennel full of dogs who had decided to obey. They voted, again, to revisit, again, which meant some trees would live by default. It was not victory. It was, in its way, better\u2014life persisting through neglect as it always had in cities where people had more pressing things to break.\n\nOn a Saturday when the clouds lay like a stubborn duvet and the D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba had exactly the right amount of shine, she met Luminita and two women from the class in the community room and tried something new. Not only flowers. Birds. They cut paper so thin it was like the skin that forms on milk left too long on stovetops. They folded wings and creased beaks and made eyes with the blunt end of a toothpick. In her hand a white bird became a place where you might hang a wish without making a fool of yourself. They strung them with invisible thread, and for an hour the room looked like a chapel of truce.\n\n\"These,\" Luminita said, tying a knot so expertly that it disappeared, \"people will call ridiculous. Then they will ask for ten. Then they will pretend they invented them. That's the progression. Try to be amused.\"\n\n\"I was born amused,\" Ileana said. \"And tired of my own amusement. I want to see if I can ride it like a horse instead of being dragged by it. Does that make sense? No. Ignore me. Tell me which scissors cut without tearing.\"\n\n\"Those,\" Luminita said, pointing, and then, after a pause, \"and also the ones you keep hidden for your own work. You are ready to keep some things.\"\n\nThe apothecary woman, whose name Ileana still hadn't earned, caught her on the way home and thrust a small jar into her hands. \"Honey with propolis,\" she said, forestalling argument. \"For the old ones with coughs that don't intend to leave until the first snow surprises them. Give it to the man with the cap. He pretends he won't accept charity. You do not offer charity. You offer a trade. He gives you stories for your bottles.\"\n\n\"I can pay\u2014\" Ileana began, and the woman shook her head in a way that looked practiced for decades.\n\n\"You will,\" she said. \"By coming back and buying something you do not need, which is the definition of culture. Enough talk. The city is listening.\"\n\nThat evening, Marius stood with his hands in his jacket pockets and looked at the sky as if it were someone speaking a dialect he had only recently learned to love. She handed him the jar and told him there was medicine in it and also bees. He smiled with the edges of his mouth and no one else would have noticed. \"My mother,\" he said, \"used to give me honey in tea and call it a contract. If I drank, I had to sleep. If I slept, I had to be good the next day. If I was good, she would forget to pick up the belt. I will honor old contracts.\"\n\nThey sat on the bench while the dog attempted to dig a hole in a piece of ground that had no interest in being excavated. A woman in a velvet tracksuit walked by with a bouquet of supermarket chrysanthemums and said, with an odd generosity that carried no request inside it, \"Beautiful. Paper?\" Ileana said yes and did not explain herself, and the woman nodded as if it were as reasonable to make flowers as to wear velvet in June. Far away, a kid kicked a ball against a wall and learned something about force and the limits of it. Somewhere closer, someone practiced a trumpet badly and then correctly and then badly again, and the sound leapt across the air like a bright fish.\n\nSunday came with the taste of obligation. Her mother called early. \"I heard about the mother of that man,\" she said, wasting no time on salutation. \"The one with the keys. The one who sleeps with his broom. Dumnezeu s-o ierte. Did you go? Did you bring something? Did you embarrass us?\"\n\n\"I brought coffee. Flowers. And myself,\" Ileana said, putting slices of peach into a bowl so carefully you would have thought an audience watched. \"Mami, do you ever feel like the things you make with your hands are the only honest things you do?\"\n\n\"I make sarmale,\" her mother said. \"They do not lie. They either taste good or they don't. When your father died, the priest told me to knead dough until the salt came out of my eyes. I told him I would knead his head. Then I kneaded the dough. It helped and it didn't. Life is not a recipe. Why are you asking? Are you going to start making sarmale for money? The neighbor's daughter says that is a dignified profession.\"\n\n\"I am thinking,\" Ileana said, \"of renting a small room. To hold classes. To sell what we make. To be poor in a different way.\"\n\n\"You will always be poor in one way or another,\" her mother said with that robust fatalism that had, over the years, produced both miracles and ulcers. \"Better to choose the kind of poverty that suits your face. Call me when you need money. I will say no and then I will say yes and then I will tell you a story about when flour was rationed and I wore my cousin's shoes and my toe went blue.\"\n\nAfter the call, she walked to a building three streets over, a former tailor's shop with windows that had traveled through three kinds of regime and could tell the differences if asked gently. The owner, a woman with sad eyebrows and an optimistic belt, showed her the space and waved her hand as if the air itself were rentable. \"It's damp in winter,\" she said, because she was honest to a fault. \"In summer the floor expands and pretends it's angry. The electricity is a religion we only believe in on Sundays. But look.\" She opened the back door, and a small courtyard revealed itself like a rabbit. A fig tree tried to be brave in a corner. \"The light in the morning does something to paper. I don't know if that matters to you.\"\n\n\"It does,\" Ileana said, and saw, as clearly as she had seen an invoice the week the papers finally made sense, a class of women in cheap sandals and painted nails, a man with hands that shook folding a bird crease, a child who had wandered in trailing a sugar string, a jar with a label crooked, a box under the counter where she would keep money and secrets. She did not say yes, not because she was timid but because timing mattered. She asked for three days to think, and the owner said good, because people who say yes too quickly make expensive tenants.\n\nOn Monday, the city remembered to be cruel. A truck sideswiped a motorbike on \u0218oseaua Mihai Bravu and the ambulance took longer than anyone could bear; two men nearly fought outside the bakery because one had cut the line not out of arrogance but out of an emergency of digestion; Mara cried at her desk and said it was pollen and it was not. The jar with the white bells tipped and the bells stayed together, their wire doing what it was told. At lunch, Ileana signed her name to a transfer that made her stomach cold and her palms hot. She ate bread in the car with keys in her mouth and laughed, a little mad, at the absurdity of surviving via carbohydrates.\n\nBy evening, the wind had rolled a storm in under the balcony and set it down with a thump. She took the rosemary inside and set it next to the jar of paper and thought of ships coming into ports and being told to wait until the water was in a better mood. Marius knocked on her door, an act that made the air stand up. He held his cap in both hands as if it were something that might need soothing. \"Tomorrow,\" he said, not stepping over the threshold, which thrilled and hurt her in equal measure, \"we take the pom to the church. The boys asked if they could carry. I said yes if they wash and do not spit. You come?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" she said, and then, because the whiteness of the day needed an anchor, \"I found a place. Maybe. For classes. For\u2026 something we haven't named. Will you come see?\"\n\n\"I will come stand at the door and pretend to guard,\" he said, and a corner of his mouth moved again. \"And if anyone laughs\u2026\" He didn't finish. He didn't need to.\n\nShe thought, not for the first time that week, that perhaps love, in its early, almost invisible form, took the shape of apprenticeships you didn't agree to in words. She thought, also, that numbers would save her or comfort her or at least keep her honest. She wrote a list on the back of a receipt: rent, light, tape, wire, paper, chairs, tea, cups, a kettle that didn't flip its fuse like a teenager\u2014then paused and added, in a hand that belonged to someone braver than she felt, the word enough. She pinned the receipt under a magnet that had come free in a magazine and that had long ago lost its picture but kept its hold.\n\nWhen night fell, it was the kind that came down like a curtain, fast and unapologetic. The city sighed itself to sleep in dirty fits. In the apartment beneath hers, someone sang off-key for a minute; someone laughed; someone coughed; a baby failed to be consoled and then succeeded. The paper flowers on her desk threw faint shadows that looked, if you were inclined to superstition, like the writing of a language you hadn't yet learned but might, if you sat very still, someday read.",

                              "content": "They carried the pom with the solemnity of boys pretending to be men. The youngest insisted on going in front, his hair smoothed with too much water, his shirt tucked with all the insistence of someone new to buttons; the tallest had a black ribbon pinned to his sleeve and a scab on his knee he thought no one could see. Marius walked beside them, one hand ready to catch if a wire slice wobbled, his cap tucked into the back pocket of his jacket as if he couldn\u2019t bear to cover his head today. Ileana followed with the bag of candles and the matches and the sugar, the smell of beeswax and coffee leaking from the cloth like a confession. On the corner by the kiosk the woman who sold lottery tickets made the sign of the cross without interrupting her sales pitch; the bus driver waiting at the light nodded the slow nod men have for death that doesn\u2019t belong to them but has walked their street before.\n\nThe church\u2019s courtyard was freckled with gravel that pretended to keep shoes clean and failed. A black-coated man with a face like a thumbnail took the apples from the pom and wiped them on a rag that had wiped a hundred apples before; a girl in a pink hoodie asked the priest if she could ring the bell just once and the priest, after pretending to consider, let her tug the rope with two hands. Inside, the air folded around them the way it always did, incense and damp wood and old voices arranged like chairs. Women with scarves tied in knots at the top of their heads\u2014old-fashion knots that said they did not care what magazines instructed\u2014stood with their feet slightly apart, as if bracing for a wave. The candles took light obediently, and the honeyed smoke rose in ribbons that made the saints on the wall look like the people had brought them a weather report.\n\nWhen the first prayer rose, low and droning, the boys fidgeted less. They had been instructed about biting their nails and not spitting, and they seemed glad that there was finally something for them to do that felt like a job: carry, stand straight, not drop. Marius stood close enough to the icon of the Mother that if he had leaned a fraction his cheek would have touched the frame; he did not lean. When the priest said Maria\u2019s name, they said it back in a chorus that sounded like it came from a hundred throats and also from only one, and Ileana had that moment she always had in churches, the old surprise that so many separate bodies could produce one sound as if there were agreement in the universe about anything.\n\nAfter the service, the courtyard woke into the business of grief. The coffee poured into plastic cups steamed like small grief-clouds; sugar cubes softened and broke in mouths that never mentioned sweetness on normal days. The pom stood by the gate, dressed with biscuits and coins, the paper bells pale in the bright. Children flowed around it with the instinctive respect children have for the things that might punish them; when the word came, like a small whistle of permission, they surged and plucked and fled with triumph that made the old women mutter a blessing disguised as condemnation. An old man unpinned a paper leaf and turned it in his fingers with the care he might have given to a photograph. \u201cShe would have liked this,\u201d he said to no one, and the nod that came back belonged to three people and to the pigeons who had arrived to preside.\n\nMarius took the jar of honey without theatrics. He held it in one hand and looked at it as if trying to recall where in the house he would put it so that it could be found by someone other than him. \u201cShe used to tell me the first spoon is the price you pay to be quiet,\u201d he said, and tilted the jar to watch the slow adjust. \u201cThe second spoon is for promises. The third is for lying down.\u201d He put the jar into the flat bag of grocery cloth with an efficiency that could have been mistaken for indifference. \u201cYou come tomorrow? The forty days. Don\u2019t worry, we won\u2019t make you stir the coliv\u0103. It must be someone with wrists like rope.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can wash the cups,\u201d Ileana said. \u201cI can count the candles. I can take orders without thinking I have lost something by doing what I\u2019m told.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you will be useful,\u201d he said, and for the first time that day his mouth became a smile that showed itself and did not flinch away. \u201cIt is good to be useful when the world is trying so hard not to be.\u201d\n\nBack home, she didn\u2019t go upstairs. The air under the plane trees felt like a waiting room with no clock. She sat on the bench and thought of the first time she had seen a pom, when she was five and her grandmother had insisted on pinning a coin to her dress because \u201cthe dead appreciate punctuality.\u201d The pom had been beautiful in a way that frightened her then, all that order and white in a world that was otherwise goose feathers and spilled soup. She had assumed beauty was reserved for weddings, for people who had purchased permission. To see it surround a thing that was mostly absence had made her uneasy, and that unease had, it seemed, decided to live near her bones forever. She breathed, because Luminita had taught her to breathe in the stupid moments and the sacred ones, and the breath did what it always did: insisted she belonged in her body.\n\nUpstairs, the notebook waited, and she opened it as if it might have grown teeth overnight. She wrote a list as a rehearsal in daring: call tailor\u2019s shop owner about terms; ask Mara to design a flyer and pretend not to care if she groaned; buy a kettle, even if it explodes the fuse; find secondhand chairs, not too many, not too few; ask Luminita which days she\u2019d teach if she were free of her stall in the afternoons; ask Marius if he would fix the hinge on the back door; ask the apothecary if she had a way to keep moths from eating paper that isn\u2019t poisonous or a superstition that requires a hymn. The list looked like a benevolent threat. She understood that the only way to trick fear was to keep it so busy it forgot to show its teeth.\n\nShe signed the lease on a Tuesday at a desk that had seen uniforms and ribbons and ration cards and engagement party decorations. The owner wore her sad eyebrows and the optimistic belt and accepted a lesser deposit than she\u2019d asked for without sighing. \u201cI prefer occupiers of space,\u201d she said, pushing the keys across the desk as if they were small children who must be taught to walk. \u201cEmpty rooms make a neighborhood ill. People start thinking the city is a hallway they can run down without hitting anyone. Bring tea. Put a curtain. Do not put fairy lights. My nerves cannot take them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will put a plant,\u201d Ileana promised, and felt older and sillier for making a promise about a plant. She called Marius as she walked the three streets back with the keys, and the way he answered\u2014one word\u2014felt, by now, as intimate as any endearment she had received in her life. She told him the back door swelled in the frame; he grunted, which meant he would arrive with a plane and a small song he made with the blade without knowing. She told him the floor complained when she walked; he said he would bring wedges and the patience he usually reserved for the gate.\n\nIn the shop the light did its trick, slipping across the floorboards like a visitor who had been here before and was willing to pretend surprise. The walls had been papered and then stripped and then papered again, and they held, in abstract patterns, twenty years of someone else\u2019s taste. The counter served no logical purpose yet, but she wiped it anyway, because wiping it gave it a function: to be cleaned, to receive palms, to brace a woman who might come in with a story. She stuck the kettle in the corner and ran a cord to an outlet that could not be trusted. She put the jar of honey on the shelf at eye level and permitted herself the superstition that it would sweeten something invisible.\n\nWhen Luminita came, she brought the feeling she always brought, like a procession of good ants. Her bracelets chimed against the counter; her daughter-in-law carried a box of crepe like a baby. \u201cWe start with dust,\u201d she announced cheerfully. \u201cIf you sweep before the priest comes, he scolds you for vanity. If you sweep before the city comes, it may give you a pass. Ah. Your windows will be your custom. People like to see their doubts reflected in pretty glass.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople like to see their reflections softened by something with a story,\u201d Ileana said, and Luminita looked at her and grinned, a grin that included wrinkles that deserved their own church icon. \u201cWe will make a story. We will price it in coins and patience.\u201d\n\nMara arrived late, carrying a plant she insisted was a fern and a poster she had designed on her lunch hour when she should have been filing invoices. The poster was black and white with one red flower, more motive than object, a corner accidentally torn because she had taken the tram at rush hour. \u201cIf anyone laughs at the font, we disinvite them from the human race,\u201d she said, and then, seeing the keys on the counter, softened in a way she would deny if accused. \u201cIt smells like glue and ambition. Perfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt smells like the men\u2019s barber used to smell,\u201d said an old woman who had lived on the street since long before anyone started talking about property. She leaned in the door with her shopping bag resting on her shin. \u201cLemn. Marf\u0103 bun\u0103. Good wood. I had my hair set here once, when I could afford to be frivolous and not call it therapy. Are those paper? They look like what my mother made for the icon corner. She used to pin coins at the edge and tell us not to steal them unless we had a truly good plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can come in,\u201d Ileana said, gesturing her closer. \u201cWe have no prices yet, so everything is a gift or a mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cGift,\u201d the woman said, practical, and stepped inside, rubbing one thumb over another the way people do when they\u2019re rehearsing a bill. \u201cMy niece is getting married for the second time, which is the time when people whisper louder. I intend to give her something that makes even ugly mouths close.\u201d\n\nThey worked until the walls felt less like witnesses and more like accomplices. Marius planed the door and whistled without realizing it. He put a new screw in the hinge and told her to rub soap on the edge when it swelled in rain; he wedged the floor where the boards had started to believe in their own drama. He refused a glass of tea and then accepted it without thanks in the way of men who don\u2019t know how to say yes without becoming susceptible to yes. When the first pair of teenage girls slipped in, open-mouthed and tenderly scornful of everything on principle, he pretended he had become a coat rack and let them compare strands of crepe to their nails under their breath. Young men walked by outside with the particular swagger of men who have seen something bad and decided to make it into a joke before it eats them; one stopped and said, \u201cBun\u0103, doamn\u0103, how much for that, to take to a girl who will say no?\u201d and Ileana named a price that made him blink and then grin and dig in his pocket as if the coins had decided, finally, to be brave.\n\nC\u0103t\u0103lin came, of course, as all people who imagine themselves center of a neighborhood come when they sense something is being built without their opining. He stood in the doorway with his arms crossed to reproduce the shape of a judge and said, \u201cSo. Arts and crafts. I suppose this is\u2026 charming.\u201d It was the way he stretched the last word that invited blood. Marius didn\u2019t change position. He wiped the blade of the plane as if it had been used to carve something important. \u201cWe\u2019re building a place where people can hold something in their hands and not harm themselves,\u201d he said, and the simplicity of the sentence did what long arguments couldn\u2019t. C\u0103t\u0103lin shrugged, made a comment about parking, and retreated into the world where he did not have to invent new ways to respect the work of others.\n\nThe first class in the new space was full because there are, always, people hungry for the kind of attention that has nothing to do with pity. A nurse came who had been told by her supervisor that her empathy was causing delays; a woman whose daughter had just emigrated to Germany and who wanted to make something that didn\u2019t require visas; a boy with a shaved head and a scar near his ear who said his aunt had sent him and who spent the first ten minutes scoffing and the next forty watching his own hands with interest he tried to convert into disdain and failed; the man with the tremor returned and took his place in the corner by the window and whispered, as if to the scissors, \u201cNu te gr\u0103bi. Don\u2019t rush.\u201d They cut petals for chrysanthemums, the flower the city had decided could be all purposes if you were clever enough. Luminita made rounds like a ship\u2019s captain; Ileana moved from hand to hand with tape and encouragement and the particular delight that comes from seeing a woman lift her head as if air has improved.\n\nIn between teaching and taping, in the hours where no one watched over her shoulder, Ileana ran numbers with the same reverence she ran her fingers over the good crepe. Rent and light and tape went into columns that did not shiver; the frog-march of expenses lined up; profit failed to appear in the cheeks as often as she liked, but it arrived in places she had not thought to count: in the woman who ignored the pain in her wrist for fifteen minutes because her flower needed one more turn; in the boy who carried a bouquet to the tram with the seriousness of a man who has decided to choose something for his life and is going to defend it; in the old woman who brought a jar of pickles and announced that everything good begins with vinegar and sugar in equal amounts. Mara stuck a small box by the door for contributions and closed her eyes when people dropped coins in it, because she believed money made fools of the generous and the desperate equally.\n\nThe apothecary woman came one afternoon wearing a cardigan that had seen three wars and a pair of shoes that promised nothing. She stood with her hands in the safe place that is the waistband of a skirt and watched without granting approval. When they paused, she said, \u201cI am Viorica. If you insist on calling me doamn\u0103, I will throw this jar of cucumber water at your feet and make you clean it.\u201d The naming felt like a benediction and a dare. She set a small bottle on the counter\u2014the kind with the dropper\u2014and said, \u201cNot homeopathy. Tincture. Real plant. Real burn. For the women whose sleep is not where they left it. I will charge you enough to respect it and not enough to resent me. And when the stubborn ones come\u2014there are always stubborn ones who think will is stronger than chemistry\u2014you send them to me and I will insult them into drinking tea.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeal,\u201d Ileana said, glad to be instructed. \u201cAnd for moths?\u201d\n\n\u201cLavender,\u201d Viorica said, rolling her eyes at the banality of it. \u201cAnd cedar shavings. And a story stuck under the paper about a woman who kept a dress for twenty years because she thought she would be thin again and then wore it to visit the doctor who told her that thinness is a religion invented by people who don\u2019t have to lift sacks of potatoes. Moths appreciate irony. They will go eat someone\u2019s winter sofa instead.\u201d\n\nWhen the storm finally did what it had been rattling its chains to do for days, it threw a branch from the plane tree down like a sentence. The crack woke the courtyard. C\u0103t\u0103lin took the branch in hand like an exhibit and said, \u201cSee? Danger. Lawsuit.\u201d Ileana was at the sink, rinsing glue from her fingers, and when she came out, the courtyard had the particular charge it gets when men are ready to speak the way they think men should speak. Marius stood with his hand on the trunk, palm flat, like a doctor listening to a heart. \u201cOnly this one,\u201d he said, tapping a higher branch with the metal tip of his broom as if the broom were a scalpel. \u201cAnd the one behind it. The wind says these are bouncers. The rest can stand. They know how to bow.\u201d He had a rope over his shoulder, a rope that had hauled fridges and sofas and once, he\u2019d told her, a goat that had refused to negotiate with gravity.\n\n\u201cCall a company,\u201d C\u0103t\u0103lin demanded, waving his printed estimate like a flag. \u201cProfessionals. Insurance. Receipts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a profession,\u201d Marius said, tying the rope around the trunk without looking. \u201cThe wind and I will sign your receipt.\u201d The little boys clustered, lip-chewing, feigning boredom with their hands in their pockets. Ileana had already grabbed the extra coil and fed him slack as he climbed, the rope braced across her waist, her heels dug into the courtyard\u2019s reliable grit. The dog lay down with his nose on his paws, every nerve taut and pretending not to be. The climb was slow, the small movements of a man who had learned that heroism is another word for foolishness if you don\u2019t watch the hinge. He looped the rope and cut with a saw that looked too modest to win and coaxed the branch down in a patient arc so that it landed as if choosing to lie. The second branch came easier; the third, once he was up there, Marius cut because it whispered so obviously of future disaster even C\u0103t\u0103lin quieted. When he came down he sat on the trunk as if on an old friend and breathed as if he\u2019d been holding the breath for an hour, which he had.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to get yourself killed,\u201d Mara said from the doorway of the shop, though her hands shook in the way of admiration looked at sideways. \u201cAnd then who will I mock when my jokes land and need a soft place?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne day,\u201d he said, wiping a scuffed hand across his face, leaving a clean print in the dust, \u201cwe will all be this tree. Someone will decide we are good for shade and also for accidents. If we are lucky, a person who listens to wind will make the call.\u201d He nodded at Ileana, formal as if they were exchanging a medal. \u201cYou held well.\u201d\n\n\u201cI count for a living,\u201d she said. \u201cI can count rope.\u201d\n\nHer mother came to the shop two weeks later, with the gait of a person who had resisted and then, against her own doctrine, given in. She wore her good coat because she did not believe in mixing sorrows and pleasures, and because if anyone photographed her she wanted to be able to show that she had always been dignified. She walked around like a border guard and then took a seat without permission at the corner table, where the papers slid into her possession. \u201cHm,\u201d she said, about everything that might have elicited delight or disdain. \u201cAt least it is clean. At least you are not selling cigarettes to children. At least I can tell people you opened something and they will not imagine a mistake with a man.\u201d\n\n\u201cMami,\u201d Ileana said, cutting a strip and then handing the scissors over, not because her mother had asked but because leaving her hands empty seemed unreasonable, \u201cdo you want to try?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not twelve,\u201d her mother said, and then, two minutes later, holding a petal that had the shape of her own mouth, \u201cHow much do you charge for this? Huh. Too little. People think things are cheap when they are cheap. You must charge enough that they feel they have been forgiven for not doing it themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you approve?\u201d Ileana asked, not because she needed permission but because the old instinct has a long leash. Her mother pursed her lips like a woman swallowing vinegar in order to feel superior to those who use sugar. \u201cI approve of a woman who doesn\u2019t wait for a man to bring her a violet,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you marry a fool, at least when he leaves you will have a room with keys. Did you put rosemary at the door? My mother did. It keeps thieves and melancholy away in equal measure.\u201d\n\n\u201cI put rosemary everywhere,\u201d Ileana said, and when her mother turned the petal between fingers thickened by decades of dough and buckets and lifting another life\u2019s weight, something in the air settled as if furniture had been moved and finally found its right place.\n\nTheft came anyway, because the city cannot resist a window. Two days after the class where they had learned to fold birds until the air looked like it believed in itself, a bouquet disappeared from the front display while she unwrapped a delivery in the back and Luminita was explaining to a man that no, his wife would not like orange lilies if she had said she did not. Ileana stood with the absence in her hand and felt, not anger, but a rush of pride that embarrassed her. \u201cSomeone chose us,\u201d she said, and Marius, adjusting the sign that squeaked when the chock moved, nodded as if he had been waiting for her to understand the law of small losses.\n\n\u201cPeople steal what whispers to them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t bother with things that shout.\u201d He looked toward the street where a woman in a blue dress with a fraying hem walked by, the bouquet tucked under her elbow like a loaf. \u201cMaybe she is going to make trouble and needs courage. Maybe she saw her own hunger in your window and preferred to put it under her arm than admit it. If you like, I will pretend to chase her and scare her into buying two next time.\u201d\n\n\u201cPretend,\u201d Ileana said, laughing into the tightness in her chest. \u201cI do not want paperwork.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the month, the shop looked as if it had always been itself. The good scissors had found their place under an old tin with a picture of peaches that were more fanciful than peaches ever are; the kettle had learned not to sulk when asked to boil; the corner where the floor pitched had become the province of children who preferred to sit on a cushion and cut badly until suddenly they cut well; the shelf near the window held bottles with labels written by a woman with handwriting that could convince goats to behave. People came and stayed beyond the time rational people allot for errands. They told Luminita about their exes. They told Viorica about their kidneys. They told Marius about their gates. They told Ileana about their daughters and their sons and their desire to stay in a city that had always made leaving sound so reasonable.\n\nOne evening, as the light made its little play on the wall, she counted taxis at the crosswalk not because the numbers would save her but because they were another way to keep time that didn\u2019t involve waiting for emails. Seven stopped. Twelve did not. A man ran, his bag slapping his thigh, and made it, and lifted his hand to the driver as if to say, you saved my life. A woman refused to run, stood, let her hair lift in the small wind the cars made, and when a taxi did stop she shook her head, refusing the victory, and a small boy laughed, the delighted laugh of someone who has not yet learned that refusal is an art. She turned back to the table and pressed the edges of a peony between her fingers and knew, with the calm that arrives like a sleep when you stop insisting on it, that she had made a home out of paper that would not betray her as quickly as people did.\n\nAt night, when she closed the shutters and pushed the bolt and left the room to the dust that performs its slow arithmetic without witnesses, she walked home the long way, along the D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba that had decided, this late, to reflect faithfully. The river held, in streaks, the streetlamps and the absurd glow of a billboard promising eternal youth if you are willing to pay enough and a neon cross that blinked as if God had a sense of humor. She thought of the first time she had inhaled the smell of crepe dye and dust and felt something rearrange inside her like furniture moved in heavy rain. She thought of Marius\u2019s mother, who would have laughed at the honey and told her not to forget to buy matches in case the electricity remembered its grudges. She thought of the way the boys had held the pom as if it were a person who needed convincing. She thought of Sorin, whose cologne had finally left the room, and of the way signing a name can feel like either murder or baptism depending on the ink. She thought of lists and felt no itch to write one.\n\nAt the bench, the stray dog lifted his head and watched her pass as if she were the moon and he didn\u2019t want to miss the only show he could afford. The gate breathed when she opened it, no longer moaning, only informing the air. In the stairwell, someone had hung a sprig of basil because the neighbor\u2019s baby had cut a tooth, and the smell felt like medicine trying to pretend it was celebration. On her table, the white birds hung from a wire like a small weather. They cast shadows that were not words yet and that might not become words and that, even so, taught her the patience to wait for a language that would take her, when it was ready, into its mouth.",

                              "content": "By the time the ginkgo leaves remembered yellow, the D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba had a way of refusing to commit to any one temperament. It woke cold, chiseled by a breeze that smelled of rust and walnuts, then flared to life at noon when light poured itself in like uninvited relatives, and by dusk it had the sullenness of a child denied a fairground ride. Ileana watched it while counting taxis with the same cool attention she gave the spreadsheet column that always tried to frighten her. Four stopped; eight did not; one slid past, saw his own face in the glass of a storefront, and reversed sheepishly as if to apologize to his better nature. She sipped coffee and thought that perhaps it was good training, to keep track of small compliance in a city that rarely offered any, and then she put the mug down and made her morning list longer than it needed to be because she had learned that some days only obeyed if you gave them too many instructions.\n\nThe shop had learned its sounds. The front bell clicked instead of ringing, a modest scrape that let her keep talking without apologizing to the air; the kettle took three tries unless you muttered at it; the scissors made two notes, one when they opened and one when they submitted to what paper wanted, and there were customers who had begun to come not only for flowers but also for that music. On a Tuesday that was bright like clean plates, a woman wearing a hospital badge came in with her shoulders squared in a way that meant she believed in her work and had an equal affection for protocols. She looked at the white lilies with a face trained not to show longing and asked, nothing apologetic in it, whether paper made people feel foolish, because she wanted to put something in rooms where flowers made sick men sneeze and where daughters needed to know that beauty could be permitted to linger.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t die,\u201d Ileana said, hating the sentence as soon as she heard it, because nothing that mattered had the decency to obey that particular law. She softened it with her hands. \u201cThey hold their shape when you ask them to. We can make them wrong on purpose, so they look less like the thing that makes people think of funerals. We can make them brazen. We can make birds, if birds feel easier. Tell me your rooms. I can picture them better if I know which window catches for no good reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe palliative ward,\u201d the woman said, and then, because naming it out loud deserved a counterweight, she smiled and added, \u201cThe windows all catch. We keep a butter knife on a string to pry them. We keep it like an heirloom. They\u2019ll call it kitsch, the old ones. They will call it kitsch until they see that it keeps shape when they forget to look. I can spend this much. If you throw in two extra because I lied and told you I can only spend this much, we will be friends forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cFriends forever is expensive,\u201d Ileana said, and Luminita, behind her at the back table, laughed the generous laugh that had first undone a morning at Obor and turned it into a promise. They made lilies that refused to behave, then taught them manners, and when the woman left with a box that knocked softly against her leg, the shop felt as if it had been entrusted with a seriousness it wanted.\n\nThe call from Constan\u021ba came in the hour of the afternoon when the light loses interest and papers become a duty rather than a reward. The driver breathed into the phone in that way people do when they have bad news to deliver to someone who is not their enemy. \u201cDoamn\u0103,\u201d he said, using the formality as a life raft, \u201cbleah, vame\u0219ii, the customs, they want a paper I do not have, which is to say they want money I pretend we do not carry. The container sits. The crane looks at me like a god. You come? Or you bless? I can wait two days before the warehouse man begins to explain patience to me with his elbow.\u201d\n\nShe had learned to keep certain shoes under the counter for moments like this. She told Mara to hand Viorica the key if she came, to tell Marius where the ladder was if the back door sulked, and she kissed the top of the kettle as if asking it to behave in her absence. On the train, she stood because everyone stood, men pretending not to see her while also moving to give her space in that peculiar choreography of care Bucharest men performed when no one was watching, and she watched the fields scroll by, their green licked brown at the edges, hay rolls thrown like punctuation across flat sentences. She had forgotten the smell of the sea that\u2019s not the sea but the port telling you stories about it; in her head, Constan\u021ba\u2019s cranes were birds with good posture and mean tempers, its stacks of containers were books no one read but everyone quoted, and when she got off and the wind shouldered her, the salt was not romance but the metal kind that leaves its taste on the backs of your teeth.\n\nAt the gate, a man with a clipboard and a hairline that had negotiated terms with his skull looked over her head and past her shoulder and then finally, grudgingly, at her face. \u201cIf you are here to cry,\u201d he said, not unkindly, \u201cdo it on that side. It\u2019s the crying side. If you are here to argue, you need this badge. If you are here to bribe, use small bills. They disrespect big ones, think you\u2019re showing off. Who are you? Don\u2019t answer. I know who you are. You are the woman who refused to pay last time and made me find the paper that should have existed all along.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am the woman who reads footnotes,\u201d Ileana said, and he snorted the snort of a man who had once had dreams and now preferred efficiencies. There was an inspector who said the word \u201cprotocol\u201d like a hymn, there was a worker who had learned to smoke with his lip instead of his fingers to keep both hands on what mattered, there was an office that had not changed since a government that no longer existed and would not change under three more. The paper they wanted did exist, but not in the way they wanted it, and she called the woman in a different office who owed her nothing and asked anyway, and the woman looked up the regulation and said, \u201cIf you promise to stop sending me emails at midnight, I will fax you the world,\u201d and Ileana said \u201cI do not promise,\u201d and the woman faxed her the world anyway because sometimes refusing to be charmed is also a way of being charmed.\n\nShe did not pay. She paid in time, which is also currency, and she earned the container back with the kind of sweat that leaves no stain and that no one in the room will later admit to having noticed. The driver hugged her with his shoulder and said a blessing layered with cursing so that the gods would be amused and not take offense, and she stood there a minute and watched the cranes lower and raise their steel necks like pious dinosaurs and thought: this, too, is breath. She sat in a cafe near the port where the cups were chipped and a television in the corner pretended to be essential and counted, for her own stubborn reasons, how many men dipped sugar directly into their mouths before letting the coffee try its luck.\n\nBack at the shop, the floorboards had survived a small flood, because Marius had heard, through the thin rattle of the radio and the fatter rattle of his own thoughts, a hiss behind the wall, and had pried the panel with a neatness that insulted nails. He had cut off the water with that calm anger that belongs to men who have repaired things in silence their entire lives, and when she returned with salt on her clothes, he pointed with his chin at the bucket and at the place where the floor had been lifted and then put back down as gently as a sleeping child. \u201cIt tried to remember it was a boat,\u201d he said, and she laughed because she was tired enough to be obedient to good metaphors. \u201cI told it no. I told it to be a floor. You owe me a rope. And a sandwich.\u201d\n\n\u201cI owe you three ropes,\u201d she said, thinking of the tree and of the way his breath had come down his throat like a saw\u2019s tooth, \u201cand an entire city that learns to mind its hinges when you ask it to.\u201d\n\nThe boys had been to the shop while she was gone and had pressed their noses to the glass and written names into the steam and then wiped them away quickly because they had begun to understand that the pleasure of naming is sometimes in the privacy. One of them had slipped a paper bird into his jacket and then returned an hour later with his aunt and a folded bill and a face that tried to look like it belonged to a man who considered options. \u201cIt flew,\u201d he said, irritated that anyone might find him remarkable. \u201cThen it fell. It needs a perch.\u201d He helped her tie a clear thread to the lamp and tried not to be proud when the bird did what gravity instructed in a way that made it look like hovering. Marius watched from the door and said nothing, reserving the simple sentence for later when the boy kicked the ball against the wall harder than necessary, and then he turned, fixed the latch with two small turns of his wrist, and told the boy, \u201cWanting is not shameful. Even for men. The trick is to learn where to put it.\u201d\n\nThere were days when Viorica refused to be politic. A man marched into the shop with his chest ahead of his thoughts and demanded pills because his wife would not sleep and believed in drops more than in tea. Viorica stood with her cardigan buttoned up to the throat and her eyes two slits of patience and said, \u201cSir, if I sell you placebos, you will come back tomorrow and buy a more expensive lie. If I sell you sun\u0103toare and tei and teach you where to put it in the cup and when to insist on quiet in your house, you will come back next week and pretend it was your idea and I will let you. Which do you prefer? I am cheap only in insults.\u201d He bought both, of course, a vial to hide and a paper bag to show, and Ileana learned again that commerce, in its noble form, is partly theater.\n\nThe building association attempted one more coup, a meeting called under the pretext of \u201csanitation\u201d where a man with a relative in a paving company unveiled a brochure with pictures of German courtyards pretending to be Romanian. There was so much glass that even the pictures looked cold. Ileana brought a jar of rosemary cuttings to the table like an offering and said nothing for ten minutes, letting the men tire themselves, and then she said, when the complications had been made to sound like inevitabilities, \u201cIf you pave this, heat collects. Children fall and their teeth chip. You will become the man who explains to a mother why her little boy\u2019s mouth learned to be less lovely because your cousin sells stones. Do you want to be that man? Or do you want to be the one who can name three birds?\u201d She did not mean it to be a charm. It worked as one anyway, because the old woman with the white hair who had won the last argument for them said, \u201cCioc\u00e2rlie, mierl\u0103, co\u021bofan\u0103,\u201d with relish, and Marius pointed at the plane tree and said, \u201cAnd the wind,\u201d and the paving company brochure, for once in its life, did not convince.\n\nThe forty days collected themselves like strict beads. The coffee diminished, the towels got washed and returned, the basil at the door of the apartment upstairs went from crisp to tired to brown and then bright again because a clever neighbor coaxed it back. On the fortieth, Marius stood like a guard and then like a son and then like a man who will have to decide how to talk about his mother when no priest is handy, and after the small procession, after the candles and the small rush of children\u2019s hands, after the words that always came too late to be useful, he and Ileana walked, not together but in concert, toward the cemetery where Bucharest becomes quiet not out of respect but out of exhaustion. The path laced itself with old names and proud ones and ones written by a hand that hadn\u2019t been taught to flourish, and every fifth grave had a plastic flower that had dimmed to a color not in nature, and Ileana put the white bird she had tied with thread on the corner of the stone and did not take a photograph because some things want to be proof only for the people who were there.\n\n\u201cHow did you get that?\u201d she asked him finally, when the silence had grown comfortable enough to hold a story without dropping it, touching her wrist in the same place his scar made lace. He looked at his own, turned it, judged it as if he were appraising a tool at the market. \u201cA belt caught my hand at the factory when I was nineteen and thought I was invincible, which is to say stupid,\u201d he said, in that flat tone that refused pity on entry. \u201cIt sent me home for three weeks to learn that I liked the way the courtyard smells after rain more than I liked men yelling at me to hurry with bolts. I went back because you go back. The second time I left because my mother fell, and then I did not go back because things needed fixing closer to our door. I became the man who knows doors. It is not a profession. It pays me in the absence of fire. I do not hate it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI make order out of paper,\u201d she said, like a confession and like a joke, and he nodded because for once the sentence did not need to learn irony to live.\n\nThe newspaper discovered the shop the way newspapers discover things that have been waiting like small friendly traps for years. It sent a woman with a notebook who tried to be invisible and then gave up and asked questions and then stopped asking and cut a petal and taped it badly and decided not to be embarrassed by being taught. The headline, when it came, made her choke on her toast: \u201cFor the Living and the Dead: A Shop Where Paper Holds.\u201d There was a photograph where her hand looked more confident than her face, there was a paragraph that convinced even C\u0103t\u0103lin to stop saying \u201ccrafts\u201d as if he were allergic, there was a sentence that made her mother phone and say, \u201cYou look tired but important,\u201d which was the closest thing to unambiguous praise the woman had in her pantry. Sorin sent a message with no letters, only a half-smile and a question mark, and she moved the message into the folder where she stored other things she refused to feed.\n\nThe hospital ward made its own kind of weather. The lilies sat on the windowsill like brave soldiers. A woman whose granddaughter had braided blue into her hair the day before said, \u201cThey will not die on me,\u201d and picked one up and examined it like a problem she could finally solve. A man with fingers that trembled less when he held wire asked if he could keep the bell until the nurse told him he couldn\u2019t, and the nurse did not. At night, when Ileana lay down, she could see where the paper\u2019s grain had given a petal a line like a life line in a palm, and it pleased her in a way she did not try to explain to herself.\n\nThere was theft, again, delightfully. A bouquet went, a small one, the kind that sits in the bend of an elbow on the way to an apology. Ileana lifted the absence in her hand and felt the flare of anger the city teaches you to keep ready, and then she put it down and let the pride replace it, because she had decided that pride, in reasonable doses, kept a woman from shrinking for no pay. Marius made a show of checking the screws on the display and said, as if instructing her in a recipe, that if you arrange the stems with the cut side toward the door the petty thieves might hesitate because they fear sap, even if there is none. \u201cPeople who take without asking,\u201d he said, \u201care often idioti with manners toward plants.\u201d\n\nThe tailor\u2019s shop became, in the fastest way a room can, a place people started giving addresses with when they wanted a friend to know they were paying attention. \u201cAt the paper,\u201d they said, and meant the corner with the strange light and the woman who tried not to boss you unless her eyebrows lost patience. Viorica started to leave her bottles in a row that made an army of browns; she behaved as if she had always kept office hours there and then scolded a teenager into eating soup with garlic when he confessed he hadn\u2019t breathed through his nose in a week. Luminita, who had taught her bracelets to learn a softer chime in small rooms, started a class made only of people who claimed they did not need companionship and then claimed it anyway. Mara kept a list of the worst fonts people suggested for their poster, and when the list reached ten, she bought a pastry and said she would forgive the city anything for sugar.\n\nOne afternoon, the light decided to show off. It came through the old glass and fractured itself on dust and hung in the air as if it had come to class late and wanted to demonstrate that it could still answer questions. Ileana took down the white birds and dusted the thread with the careful pinch of someone who knows how little frays matter until they suddenly do, and she thought of the first day she had met Luminita and touched crepe without believing in her own fingers, and of the way she had said no to the easy money and yes to the thing with no guarantee, and of the way a man like Marius could hold a rope and tell a branch when to surrender. She wondered if everything she loved now was a way of convincing herself that control existed, even in small clever forms, even in rooms that leak, even in courtyards where men vote on light, and the thought did not shame her. There are worse religions than faith in a hinge that obeys oil.\n\nIn the evening, the D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba did that trick it had not tired of, holding on its back the entire neighborhood in pieces: a window with a woman\u2019s hair in it, a neon pharmacy cross that blinked as if to keep time for ambulances, a lamp that made old paint on a bridge look like a blessing. The wind had learned everyone\u2019s names by now, or at least their whistles; it slipped between buildings the way people slip into rooms where they\u2019re not expected but know they\u2019ll be tolerated. Ileana walked slower than she had when the shop was an idea that pinched; she could afford to take time from herself and hand it back. The bench in the courtyard was free for the first time all afternoon, the dog having decided to inspect a more promising smell near the bins, and she sat and counted not taxis but windows that let their curtains be open, and the number surprised her. She had always imagined the city closed against itself; she had been wrong in a way she could enjoy.\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Marius said from the shadow near the gate, not emerging as if to honor the old liturgy he had invented for them where their most important sentences lived near the edge of seeing, \u201cwe will take down the pom.\u201d He had put off the act not because he was sentimental, which he distrusted in himself, but because he believed in certain arbitrary intervals. \u201cBring your scissors with the black handle. Not the ones your mother used. They bite.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will bring the ones that forgive me when I pull wrong,\u201d she said, and in the way the courtyard accepted the sentence and held it and then let it go, there was the smallest kind of peace. She wrote a list when she climbed the stairs, not because it would save her, but because it would remind the part of her that fussed that there were things she could do while the city made its ancient, ridiculous plans. Wire. Lavender. Receipt book. Rope. Kettle gaskets. A plant that is not rosemary, because we must not demand too much from one soldier. And at the very end, underlined because it had become a form of prayer: call Viorica; ask for a story to get us through winter.",

Today they had the twitch in their legs again; they wanted tasks that felt like danger but could be disguised as duty. Marius brought out the old wooden ladder and leaned it into the tree\u2019s shoulder as if it were leaning into a man who had promised not to move. Ileana stood with her black-handled scissors, not the ones her mother had used, and felt for the first time that the blades had moods. The paper was softer where fingers had touched it for weeks, oil turning crispness into a compliant satin. She cut the threads that held bells and leaves and biscuits, and each time a ribbon came loose and fell into her hand she thought of a sentence being unstitched quietly so that the meaning could be used again elsewhere.\n\nThey kept the coins for the church\u2019s box not because anyone needed to be conscientious about accounting but because ritual pays its debts how it can. The apples had shriveled into smaller truths; the youngest boy bit into one, grimaced, and then finished it with the bravado of someone who had decided to be stubborn on principle. A neighbor who had mislaid her spectacles and found them on top of her head twice in the same hour stood to collect the paper bells with the kind of care that would have made you think they were porcelain. \u201cFor Easter,\u201d she said, though no one asked her to justify herself, and then whispered to Ileana as if they were sharing contraband gossip, \u201cI like it when things last too long and make people nervous.\u201d\n\nWhen the wire crown came off the top of the pom, Marius bent it back into a line with his palms, slow, as if he were listening for its permission to be straight again. His face was back to its practiced privacy, but his hands were less stingy. He passed Ileana the bent shape, and she coiled it like a snake that had remembered being a rope. \u201cWe make another,\u201d he said, not to fill the air but because repetition had become a form of respect. \u201cFor someone we do not yet know. That is a good way to spend a day.\u201d\n\nAfter the pom, after the biscuits were redistributed and the stubborn apple core was thrown to the dog by a boy who pretended the dog\u2019s delight was beneath his notice, the courtyard resumed its weekday argument with time. The building\u2019s pipes shouted once and then held their peace. Somewhere an impatient shoe learned the rhythm of the stairwell. In the shop, the kettle did its old trick of sulking until talked to like a friend who might leave, then boiled as if it had never doubted itself. Luminita came late and apologetic, bracelets subdued, a new cut on her thumb that she waved away with the breezy contempt of a woman who has had worse. \u201cMy daughter-in-law says we should put our classes on Facebook,\u201d she announced, as if they were considering inviting an ancient aunt to a party. \u201cI told her Facebook is a square where everyone screams and counts that as conversation. She called me medieval. I told her I prefer ages where people look at you when they lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can do both,\u201d Mara called from the counter, where she had arranged small birds in a row to resemble a sentence only she could read. \u201cThe square and the room. One pays in clicks, the other pays in people. Both currencies are unreliable, but at least the people sometimes bring pickles.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not bait me with pickles,\u201d Viorica said from the doorway, and dropped a bundle of dried lavender on the counter like an assignment. \u201cFor your moths. And for your nerves. A city is a mouth. It will chew you unless you make it bite something else. Today I bring a story about a woman who tried to heal a fever with brandy and then married the man who brought her water instead. It will get us through November.\u201d\n\nShe told it while they cut paper to the width of a thumb. It was a shabby story at first, a story of a woman whose kitchen had a floor that sloped toward the door so that soup was obliged to learn maritime law, and of a doctor who had learned, young, that if you arrive with authority and a clean collar, people forgive you almost anything. The brandy was a neighbor\u2019s prescription, the water was the doctor\u2019s, and the temperature dropped because time did what it sometimes does when you are watching it too closely and decides you do not deserve a lesson you have paid for. \u201cThe woman married the doctor,\u201d Viorica concluded, rolling a piece of green tape between her fingers until it warmed to her will, \u201cand then spent forty years telling him that it had been the water. He let her have it, which is the only reason they lasted. Men are not saved by tinctures. They are saved by choosing which parts of the story to insist on.\u201d She looked at Marius as if to make sure he had heard. He nodded gravely, which in his language was the same as a laugh.\n\nWhen the weather lowered its chin and breathed chill, the shop filled with the kind of customers who had opinions about warmth. A woman with a small dog in her big bag demanded birds with gold edges for a chandelier because the electrician had told her she could not hang anything heavy with the way the ceiling had been compromised by a leak three tenants ago. \u201cGold,\u201d she said, tapping her nail against the counter as if it were a snare drum. \u201cBut tasteful. I do not want my living room to look like a cake.\u201d A man ordered paper poppies to lay at a monument and took offense when Luminita tried to steer him toward a red that wasn\u2019t the exact red his grandfather had mouthed the word for. \u201cThe exact one,\u201d he said, showing a photograph where the colors had been ruined by time into a truth of their own. \u201cOur dead are particular. They do not forgive approximations.\u201d They made the petals darker than any poppy would dare be in an obedient field, and he lifted the finished bouquet with hands that understood receiving instructions and not liking it.\n\nWith the cold came a new logistics problem, which was simply the old problem wearing a thicker coat. The container that had nearly been held in Constan\u021ba arrived wheezing, and the driver called from the hive of trucks near the ring road to say he\u2019d be late because men in reflective vests had decided to argue philosophy with cones. Ileana learned the trick of telling a client that their order was en route in a tone that conceded nothing and apologized for nothing, and when Mara managed to talk a warehouse manager into staying open for an extra hour on the strength of a lie about frozen syrups, they sent each other a message with a single goat emoji and a time, their code for not being entirely defeated by the day. Sorin\u2019s name stopped appearing in the inbox like a sting; when it popped up once, weeks after he had signed the paper that made him a figure in a story rather than a participant, it arrived with an invitation to a holiday party and a tone that imagined itself as magnanimity. She archived it without sentiment and went to check on the heater\u2019s habit of sulking.\n\nOn a morning brittle with a frost that made even the loudest men adjust their voices, the hospital nurse returned to collect a second order. Her badge had slid on its string to the angle that nurses\u2019 badges always adopt, the angle of someone who has brushed against too many tragedies in too narrow a hallway. \u201cThey said it was kitsch,\u201d she admitted, holding the box as if it were a small animal that might startle easily, \u201cand then one of the old men asked if he could take the lily with him when he was transferred, and the young doctor who thinks evidence is a religion said yes with his face and no with his mouth, and the old man found a way to take it anyway. It is sitting on his tray like a friend who has forgiven you for having been boring.\u201d She paused and looked at Ileana with curiosity that had learned its manners. \u201cWhy paper for the dying?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause the shape holds,\u201d Ileana said, only a little rehearsed by now, because some thoughts become furniture and you learn to run your hand over them when you pass. \u201cAnd because a fresh thing decays and reproaches you, and paper keeps its peace. It is not honest; I know. But existence allows cheats when the test is cruel.\u201d She gave the nurse two extra bells because there are economies you can afford when your profit is not entirely counted in bills.\n\nThat same week, the building declared war on its own pipes. A banging began behind the wall like a neighbor practicing the drum without having first discovered rhythm; then came a hiss and then a thin jet of water that had no intention of negotiating. Marius appeared with his little army\u2014the wrench that had belonged to another man\u2019s grandfather, the roll of Teflon tape that resented hurry, the old cloths that had once been a good shirt\u2014and shut off the right valve with the accuracy of a father reaching for a falling glass. He did not curse, which was how she knew it was bad. The downstairs neighbor, whose timeshare with rage had been generous and public, arrived at the shop door with a look that told them the city could be sued and would laugh. \u201cIt dripped on my bread,\u201d he announced, all liturgy. \u201cGod will punish you. Or I will.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring the bread,\u201d Viorica said from the counter, not looking up from a label she was writing that requested that people not take more than two droppers at once unless they wanted their stomachs to learn remarkable new tricks. \u201cI will cut off the wet parts. You will eat. Then you will help carry the bucket. God punishes those who never bring the bucket.\u201d The man looked prepared to be outraged and then, without fanfare, obeyed. Sometimes the pivot between fury and usefulness is only a sentence spoken in no one\u2019s special language.\n\nOn a Thursday, with the window glass dull from the city\u2019s breath, a woman came in with a veil that signaled loss but not how recently it had arrived. She had a small boy by the hand, the kind of boy who counted cracks in the floor and then tried to step on only the light ones. She looked at the white carnations and put her fingers to the base of her throat in the old gesture people make when their body wants to prove it\u2019s still there. \u201cMy mother had these,\u201d she said, the way someone says \u201cThat was my street,\u201d not asking for ownership, only trying on the fit. \u201cShe said the paper forgave her for having to do this twice. I want a cluster. Not too neat. She was not neat. She was\u2026 generous. Generosity makes a mess.\u201d\n\n\u201cMess we can do,\u201d Luminita said, and the way she scattered the petals looked like luck but was, of course, precision disguised. The boy squeezed the end of the green tape until it stuck to itself and then made a little sound of disapproval at his own error. Marius, who pretended not to know children unless they needed a bandage or a door closed, took the tape and reversed it neatly as if errors were a currency he liked to handle. \u201cI wanted to bring real flowers,\u201d the woman said as if confessing greed in a church. \u201cMy sister said they would be a waste. My aunt said paper is for brothels and parastase. I said, then let the brothels and parastase teach us how to keep color.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will never go wrong listening to brothels and parastase,\u201d Viorica remarked without a pause, and when the woman laughed, the room took that laugh and put it carefully on the shelf where they kept small, useful things.\n\nThe tailor\u2019s shop next door let a rumor loose that warmed the street; there was to be a winter fair in the triangle where the tram turned and husbands leaned and watched their breath. It was a shabby sort of fair with a tent that smelled like soup, but there would be a stage and a man with an accordion who owed money to a woman who sold onions and there would be mulled wine in cups that would stain everyone\u2019s mouths the same optimistic red. Mara volunteered their presence before asking, and Ileana said yes before counting because sometimes you must learn to throw yourself into a market and see who catches you. They prepared over-red roses that would laugh in the face of poinsettias, and birds with tails that flickered like small flames, and wreaths that would let a door pretend to be a gate into a more forgiving place.\n\nOn the day, the wind came and left like a lover with an appointment; it tugged hair and made the tent flap like a big mouth trying not to laugh. They arranged their table with the precision of people who were not going to be mocked today, not because they were fragile but because they had decided to refuse the effort of deflecting. C\u0103t\u0103lin came by twice, the first time to remark that the table would do better closer to the stage, the second time to say a man he knew could get them real plastic flowers at such a price that they would think they\u2019d robbed him. \u201cWe are committed to our ridiculousness,\u201d Ileana said simply, and he nodded in the way men nod when they realize no amount of reason will dislodge someone\u2019s pleasure.\n\nThe children loved the birds, to no one\u2019s surprise. They tugged at the invisible thread and delighted in the way the body of the bird refused to be entirely obedient to gravity. A teenager with a face he\u2019d practiced in the mirror bought a small violet because he had been told once that violet was the color of fidelity and he wanted, for once, to be on the right side of a symbol. An old man with hands like bark told them, as if they had asked, that his wife had made paper peonies for the baptisms of all three daughters and then stopped when one daughter decided to be done with the church and the other two moved away and forgot to ask permission to be happy. \u201cI still have them,\u201d he said, and the words carried the grain of both boast and mourning. \u201cThey are ugly with dust. They are also the most beautiful things I own.\u201d\n\nLate in the day, as the stage creaked under a group of boys with a hip-hop song they had written to insult each other lovingly, as Viorica argued bourbon versus rum in mulled wine with a woman whose apron had remembered every soup she had ever made, a woman with a microphone approached the table and asked if anyone would talk into the air about what, exactly, they were selling. \u201cOrder,\u201d Mara said, without looking up, and the woman laughed until she realized the answer would not get better if she waited. Ileana said, because she had learned which sentences to reach for when the air asked, that they made flowers for the living rooms of people who could not be trusted to water a plant and also for the rooms where no one dared bring a bucket, that they made birds for windows that insisted on showing people the wrong scene, and that they made wreaths for doors that had learned to choose who to open for and who to leave on the landing. The woman wrote nothing down and thanked them and tried to summarize and failed, which pleased Ileana more than a clean paragraph would have.\n\nWhen the fair ended and the men unhooked the tent from the sky and folded it badly, the street felt bigger for having been used without injury. They counted their coins not with a miser\u2019s delight but to see if the city had given them its old yes. They had enough to pay for trays of cabbage rolls and extra glue and the bottle of brandy Viorica wanted to keep in the back for the kind of days that only yield to rituals older than science. Marius carried the crate back to the shop with one hand, the other hand in his pocket as if to telegraph that nothing on the street was a threat. When they reached the door, he said, half to himself, half to the hinge, that he could smell snow, and they all looked up like children promised a show.\n\nSnow fell like someone had finally stopped asking the sky to be reasonable. It came in flakes fat enough to be counted and made the D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba look like an old woman\u2019s shawl shaken from a chest. There is a particular hush that happens in Bucharest when snow decides to take its job seriously. For a few hours, even the men who insist on their car\u2019s right to block the tram behave like citizens of a place that can be improved by silence. Ileana watched the river fold itself and then improvise again and counted the taxis that chose to stop because it felt stingy not to. She texted her mother to say \u201cIt snows\u201d and her mother sent back a photo of a pot on the stove, the steam rising like a saint. The shop grew candlelight-fat; people came in to warm their hands and left with birds because birds looked good against winter. A young father bought a single white carnation because his daughter had said at breakfast that the weather made her heart feel like a fish in a jar and he had no idea what to do with such a sentence except take it seriously.\n\nThe cold brings with it a mean-spirited generosity: it clarifies. The building\u2019s windows separated themselves into those that wept and those that held their ground; the gate told them exactly when it would stick and why, and Marius, who carried a crumb of graphite in his pocket like a talisman, drew a line where the metal lied about itself and shaved the lie off. He climbed the plane tree once to knock snow from branches that pretended they were stronger than they were, and when he came down with white pushed into the crook of his cap he looked younger and not at all absurd. He told the boys that snow was the only teacher who could make them quiet; they ignored the insult and built a fort that pretended to be a castle and learned, without admitting it, the sweetness of holding a line together.\n\nIn a pocket of afternoon when the light forgot to be brave, Viorica arrived with a jar of something that moved slowly. \u201cQuince,\u201d she declared, setting it down with the authority of an old cookbook, which is to say, godlike. \u201cFor irritating throats and nostalgia. Both respond to sugar cooked until it tells the truth.\u201d She wore a knitted hat that made her look like a woman who did not tolerate cold if she could insult it into submission. \u201cTell me a problem,\u201d she demanded, and when no one volunteered, she provided one. \u201cI have a niece who reads on her phone until her eyes are the color of old bricks. She refuses to rest because her friends live in her palm. I will not sell her drops; I will sell her boredom. We will learn to sit and watch steam. It is not a modern cure. It is a good one.\u201d\n\n\u201cTeach a class,\u201d Ileana said, because the room had begun to feel eager for such sentences. \u201cNot here. Here, the steam will carry the glue into our lungs and we will die of our own ambitions. In your shop. On days the wind is rude. Call it decanting. People will pretend to understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI refuse to teach,\u201d Viorica said with relish. \u201cI will host. I will let the jars speak for themselves. I have told them to behave in guests\u2019 presence. They are well brought up.\u201d\n\nToward the solstice, when the city eats sausages and waits for it all to be over, Sorin appeared in the shop, smelling like the part of winter that costs extra. He stood in the doorway like a man who has learned to make his silhouette into a signature and smiled in a way he thought charming when it had often, elsewhere, scored points. \u201cSo this is where you hide,\u201d he said, looking past her with the cultivated interest of a collector who has stumbled on an object that might yet become a trend. \u201cI read about it. I thought, surely not. But here you are, with, what do they call it, artisanal\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFlowers,\u201d Ileana said, relieved at how easily her mouth refused to be managed. \u201cThey are not a concept. You can buy one if you intend to take it home and not put it on a conference room table as a conversation piece. If you are here to suggest painting the walls dark and installing a neon sign, I will ask Marius to escort you to the gate and instruct it to close.\u201d\n\nSorin looked at Marius and calculated, for once honestly, and decided to become generous. He picked up a bird with careful fingers, the way men handle small things that might embarrass them, and tilted it so the light traced its back. \u201cFor my daughter,\u201d he said, and she had forgotten for a moment that he contained people who did not smell like his cologne. \u201cShe has become a critic. She will tell me if it is sincere enough to be tolerated. She has learned this word at school: authentic. I cannot stand it, and I am grateful for it.\u201d He put money on the counter and added more than was logical, and Mara started to mock him and then, seeing the way his eyes took stock of the corners as if he were finding a place where he might, in another life, have been useful, decided to be merciful. He left with the bird wrapped in paper that had once been a newspaper story about a politician who had since left the country, and for once the paper served a purpose beyond its assigned pretense.\n\nOn the last day of the year, when fireworks practice all afternoon like untrained brass, the courtyard produced its own rough pageantry. The old woman with the white hair brought a jar of compote she had saved for a moment when someone else\u2019s mouth needed sweetness; the boys lit sparklers and discovered, to general relief, that they were not yet the kind of men who could be trusted with explosives; a teenager kissed another teenager with a bravery that made Marius find a hinge to fix intently; Viorica pretended to disdain the music that came from a neighbor\u2019s radio and then hummed while she counted how many cups had gone missing as if each cup were a person who owed her a debt. At midnight, the D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba reflected the wild and bad decisions of the city with a stoic little shimmy. Ileana stood under the balcony and counted backwards because she liked the way numbers lined up when you granted them an ending. Seven, six, five, and she thought of the list she had written the day the ginkgo went yellow and how most of it had been done by hands other than hers and how this did not offend her at all.\n\nShe went to sleep with the noise lodged in the curtains and woke to a quiet that felt borrowed. In the blunt morning, she wrote in her notebook before coffee because she had learned not to trust herself to remember if she deferred. The list was short; it made her uneasy, as if a day with only four instructions might decide to go feral. She added small things\u2014buy more tape, speak kindly to kettle, ask Marius his mother\u2019s second favorite joke\u2014and then put the notebook down as if it were a pet that had fallen asleep on her lap and didn\u2019t mind being displaced.\n\nIn January, the river grew a small skin that broke when pigeons put their minds to it. The city pretended to be resigned and was, in fact, simply cold. The hospital called for more lilies, because the new doctor who measured his kindness in metastable doses had been converted by a woman who thanked the flowers instead of him, and his resistance to anything he could not measure had wilted in the face of gratitude that recognized allies. The tailor next door closed for two weeks because his daughter had given birth in Spain to a child who would learn to count in a language he would only love second-best, and the shop lended him its key so his son could come in and stand and pretend to be in charge of something while he figured out whether his ribs could carry pride.\n\nThere were bad days that bloomed without warning, as bad days always do. A man came in and insulted the price and the premise and left having given nothing and taken thirty minutes of their time and the energy that they could otherwise have used to be patient with themselves. A box of crepe arrived the wrong weight and the warehouse manager insisted the scales had been calibrated by God and she had to spend an afternoon proving that human hands cheat because life requires us to practice. A child tore a bird and cried, and his mother scolded him with her shame disguised as authority, and Luminita had to take them both in hand and declare that everyone was being ridiculous because paper is a thing that forgives even when people don\u2019t.\n\nOn a day when the light did not rise beyond a reluctantly polite glow, a woman from a cultural institute came in with hair that had learned the hard way to be restrained. She wore a scarf that announced funding and asked, with the eagerness of someone who had been told to go find authenticity and could now bring it to a meeting, whether they would consider a workshop in a room with white walls and a video camera set like a trap. Ileana said yes because she wanted to watch people discover their hands in rooms where their voices had been trained to echo, and she said no to the part where the video clip would be cut with dramatic music because paper did not need violins to be understood. Mara designed a flyer with exactly the right amount of black and exactly the right weight of paper, and the institute woman cried at a petal because she had been forced, by her job, to become an expert at pretend.\n\nThe day after, when it seemed the city had gone back to biting itself out of habit, Marius knocked on Ileana\u2019s door with a hammer tucked under his arm as if it were a polite dog. \u201cYou wrote,\u201d he said, unembarrassed to have read her list where it lay on the counter near the kettle, \u201cto ask my mother\u2019s second joke. Her first was not for polite company. The second was that God made the wind and the priests take credit. It made her laugh alone in the kitchen. It will not sound funny if you say it at a party. That is good. Humor should be private.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will tell it to the kettle,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will boil from relief.\u201d He leaned against the doorframe and looked at her rosemary as if it were an old friend who had learned to pretend to be new. \u201cShe would have liked this shop,\u201d he added after a small silence in which the building considered whether to creak or keep its dignity. \u201cNot because of the flowers. Because people come to be asked for nothing. She would have come and told Luminita she was making too much fringe and then told her a recipe and stolen a spoon. She would have argued with Viorica about licorice root until they fell into agreement out of exhaustion. She would have told you that the gate is your best advertisement, because it opens without complaining.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I am doing something right,\u201d Ileana said, and though she knew better than to ask for approval from the dead, she felt the kind of measurable peace that the living can convert into work.\n\nFebruary tried to be cruel in new ways but found it had already used up its tricks. The boys discovered a new game with the rope and did not hang themselves with it. The building association tried one last resolution to pave the courtyard and lost not because anyone had made a speech but because half the people decided to make soup instead of attend. Sorin sent a postcard from somewhere warm with a photo of a fruit that looked indecent and wrote only \u201cCourage,\u201d which was a word he had never used when it had been needed. Viorica\u2019s jar class became a rumor that made strangers knock and ask, cautiously, whether boredom was, in fact, for sale. Luminita announced that she would teach a session on funerary wreaths that did not insult the dead by pretending they were never rude, and the class filled with women who had learned to love without bleached corners.\n\nOn a morning that held itself upright like a conscientious chair, the apothecary\u2019s bell rang before Viorica had turned her sign, and she barked at the door in a tone that would have made a general sit down. It was a woman with a hat like an apology, who explained in four sentences and a half-swallowed sob that her mother had died the previous night with a curse in her mouth and a request that made no sense. \u201cShe said,\u201d the woman reported, wringing her hands not because it helped but because she needed to see they were still attached, \u201cto bring her girls something that lasts and looks like a lie.\u201d Viorica, who would insult men into health but never laughed at the confused request of a daughter, wrote a list that contained, among practicals\u2014candles, coffee, sugar\u2014only one instruction that mattered. \u201cGo to the paper,\u201d she said. \u201cAsk for white that looks wrong. The dead, sometimes, appreciate our reluctance to be obedient.\u201d\n\nIleana made a wreath with leaves that insisted on their grain and bells that did not line up on purpose. They tied a blue ribbon under the white because the woman\u2019s hat had a single stitch of blue at the brim, and the effect pleased no one and satisfied the truth. When the woman took it, when her hands steadied for the span of two breaths, Ileana felt a fatigue lift off her shoulders like a coat. There are works that repay on delivery; this was one. She wanted to write it down\u2014the exact angle of wrongness that works when grief is a poor audience\u2014and knew that some things refused a ledger.\n\nToward the end of winter, the D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba began its lazy rehearsal for spring. Bottles that had frozen into small sculptures shivered themselves loose; gulls came back in committees and inspected their old arguments; a man washed a car with water from a bucket and made a mess of his ankles and did not mind. The rosemary by the window put out a sprig that looked greener than it had any right to be. The boys\u2019 fort dissolved into reasonable piles. The gate\u2019s hinge needed oil and got it. The shop learned the names of people\u2019s grandchildren as if they were a currency required to be legal, and Luminita taught a class of teenagers to make peonies that would eventually, when photographed in a mirror, become declarations of someone\u2019s new room. Marius repaired a hinge for an old woman who insisted on paying him in string and he accepted without altering his face, and on the way back he stopped at the bench and called the wind by its name in a voice too low for anyone but the plane tree to appreciate.\n\nOne evening, when the light had that thrift-store gold that makes everything look like a bargain, Ileana locked the shop, put the bottle of quince in her bag because it had promised to make a visit to her mother more palatable, and sat on the bench to count taxis not because she needed to but because repetition had become a hobby. Marius sat, not touching, and told her, quite simply and with his voice smaller than usual, that he had had a bad dream. It involved the factory belt and his mother and the gate refusing to open and the wind turning its back. He said it without drama, as if reporting a new sound in the pipes, and she listened in the same key. When he was done, he said, \u201cI went downstairs and stood in the courtyard so it would be stupid to be afraid, and the dog put his nose in my hand like he was paying for something and then ran away. It helped. Or it did not. It is hard to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will ask Viorica for a story,\u201d she said. \u201cOr for a bottle without a label. Sometimes labels make their contents shy.\u201d He nodded and took the quince and said he would tell her if he hated it, because that would be a mercy, and she laughed, a small, exhausted, grateful laugh that made the evening tuck itself in.\n\nSpring would find them. It would arrive not because they had arranged themselves worthily but because the city is generous with its cycles. For now, in a winter that had shown its teeth and then let them rest, they sat with their hands empty, not taking inventory, and watched the small movements\u2014the river\u2019s edge relearning the trick of ripple, the gate agreeing with its hinge, the boys stomping their boots to hear the hollow thud\u2014that make a life you can bear to live.",

                              "content": "By March the city remembered its old trick of tying red to white and pretending a thread could hold winter away. The first morning of M\u0103r\u021bi\u0219or, tram handles wore tiny tassels, and girls on the tram pretended not to notice who had pinned what to whose coat, and men with the practiced shame of tenderness fumbled in pockets for string like contraband. Obor was a rash of stalls that looked like someone had tipped a sewing basket over Bucharest; plastic clover and silver hearts and the small, miraculous women who made delicate knots with hands that had wrung laundry their whole lives argued for attention in a register that didn\u2019t tax the ears. Luminita had decided, with the briskness of a woman who considered tradition another material to be cut, that paper could be a M\u0103r\u021bi\u0219or, too, and the first morning she had, pinned to a length of string on her table, tiny bells that were irreverent, a red peony no wider than a coin, a white bird that flinched at its own shadow and then held. \u201cThey will say it is too much,\u201d she predicted, slicing the tramp\u2019s red thread with scissors that looked like they might take offense at modernity, \u201cand then their fingers will betray them. People buy excess in March because it is cheap forgiveness.\u201d\n\nIleana bought too many, then talked her way out of shame by delivering half to the hospital nurse who had begun to use the shop as a place to breathe and to finish a thought. The nurse\u2019s badge had learned to sit straight for a change; she pinned a paper bell to its corner and said, in the voice of a person who knew how to make bureaucracy obey desire for ten seconds at a time, that the head of the ward had requested \u201cthe ridiculous white ones.\u201d She was smiling when she said \u201cridiculous,\u201d and her smile suggested that any surgeon who sneered would be made to fetch a butter knife on a string to open a stubborn window as penance. \u201cIf you come Thursday,\u201d she added, \u201cthere will be music. Not the kind you pretend to like. A man with a violin who doesn\u2019t mind if he makes us cry and will also know how to play the thing my grandmother called hora lumii.\u201d\n\nAt the shop, red and white accumulations made the windows look like a small weather system. Mara tied threads around the necks of birds and refused to make a single pun about string theory, which was how Ileana knew she had been charmed against her will. Viorica turned her bottles so their labels faced the light like faces waiting to be kissed and declared that M\u0103r\u021bi\u0219or was a racket and also indispensable. \u201cWe bribed spring before we could bribe officials,\u201d she said, pushing a jar of honey forward for prominence. \u201cIt never worked as well as we hoped, but at least we invented good knots.\u201d\n\nThe city, for its part, felt permitted. Men stopped to look in the window without performing a yawn and then caught themselves and moved on; women came in with the decision to buy already made and only asked permission to enjoy it. An influencer arrived, obligatory as pollen. She had the kind of hair that had a budget, and she pointed her phone at the birds and then at her own mouth and then, mercifully, at the ceiling. \u201cWe adore,\u201d she said to the square rectangle, and Mara stood at the counter like a bouncer in a museum and said, \u201cWe sell,\u201d which ought to have been a collision and became, instead, a sort of public health disclaimer. The woman hesitated, put her phone down, and bought a violet no one had asked her to love. \u201cFor my mother,\u201d she said, a little sheepish in the way of people used to being admired and unprepared for needing to be forgiven. \u201cShe hates the internet.\u201d When she left, Mara wrote a note and stuck it on the counter: we do not accept exposure; we tan badly, and they laughed into the soft space it made.\n\nInspection arrived as all things that begin with a stamp do, unannounced and prepared to be offended. A man whose blazer had outlived two governments whistled through his front teeth at the fire extinguisher and found the kettle cord adventurous and took notes on a pad that had learned to wrinkle its own paper as if it disapproved of what was being written. \u201cAuthorization for assembling foodstuffs?\u201d he asked Viorica with a carnivore\u2019s politeness, gesturing to the corner where quince winked in a jar like a slow eye.\n\n\u201cI am not assembling,\u201d Viorica said, standing on her dignity with the grace of a goat on a roof. \u201cI am decanting. The law has yet to learn the difference because it is busy preventing youth from eating seeds on buses. Do you intend to fine me for syrup?\u201d The inspector smiled, which was alarming; he had the smile of a man who learned long ago to enjoy the sound of the word \u201creceipt.\u201d Ileana stepped in with the other kind of smile\u2014the one that offered a binder before he had asked and pointed with relief at a photocopy of a document obtained at the end of a long line where she had had time to design three classes in her head. \u201cHere,\u201d she said. \u201cAuthorization for sale of non-therapeutic herbal preparations. Here, the extinguisher, recent and enthusiastic. And here\u201d\u2014she placed a little white bird on his clipboard because she had learned the gambler\u2019s art of the inappropriate\u2014\u201cis a gift for your daughter or your mother or the fine woman at the office who does the work for you. Take it now and then decide if you want to find a problem that doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nHe tried very hard to mind his dignity. He took the bird, regretted taking the bird with the entire right side of his face, and looked around as if a hole in the floor would be polite enough to open under him and allow him to fall away from consequence. \u201cThe cord,\u201d he said at last, sighing as if he had hoped to enjoy this more. \u201cYou will change it. And you will tell the kettle to respect the electricity. And you will not boil the city with sentiment.\u201d \u201cWe will not,\u201d Ileana said, and after he left, the kettle boiled in a fit of pique and they all drank without saying the word \u201cmercy.\u201d\n\nIt was the month of mucenici, dough loops that masqueraded as figure-eights and swam in syrup thick with walnuts and orange peel. Mara declared it a religious holiday for her tongue and went missing with a plastic bowl; she returned contrite and sugared and insisted on washing every cup in the place to make up for the syrup that had managed to visit her elbow. On the ninth, Marius told the story of martyrs in a voice flat as the D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba when wind is in a mood to sulk, and the boys pretended to be bored while memorizing the parts where bones outlasted orders. \u201cNine,\u201d he said to the gate, as if gates had an interest in arithmetic. \u201cEnough to make a line. Not enough to fool a wind.\u201d He brought a pot of mucenici someone had pressed into his hands in the courtyard\u2014a pot older than whoever had made the pastries in it\u2014and Viorica declared them sinful and asked for a second bowl that she said was for science and did not elaborate.\n\nThere were complications that did not present themselves as drama, which made them difficult to take seriously and then, predictably, expensive. The landlord who owned the narrow strip of roof above the shop decided to sell his sky to someone who preferred billboards to light, and for two days men in reflective vests looked at the parapet like a problem that could be solved with a louder voice. \u201cNo,\u201d said the old woman with the white hair, who had nerves men respected without discovering they did, and then pointed her cane at the place where rain had always entered the building without first asking how long it could stay. \u201cIf you put your metal there, our damp becomes yours. You will inherit mushrooms in your walls. We are generous people. We share everything.\u201d It bought them a week, and within that week Mara found the regulation no one remembered, the one about heritage sight lines and the obligation to pretend dawn mattered, and Ileana wrote a letter that was more elegant than polite, and they wrote \u201cno\u201d on a piece of paper in a font that made the answer feel older than the men\u2019s patience, and the men went away to install their light somewhere else and claim victory.\n\nWhen she could afford an absence, Ileana took the overnight train east because the wet had lifted for a day and her mother had announced on the phone that she had cooked too much and needed to be prevented from killing herself by thrift. The compartment smelled like old perfume that had learned to live with cabbage. A woman in the upper berth told the story of a man from Tecuci who had built a house alone and had forgotten the bathroom and simply never invited anyone to visit; a boy with a voice that hadn\u2019t decided whether to crack or sing practiced a song under his breath and apologized for nothing. In Foc\u0219ani, her mother met her in the station like a soldier who had decided to greet peace with an argument. \u201cWhy are you so pale?\u201d she asked as if it were a bill. \u201cDo you eat? Do you sleep? You have the face of a saint that no one knows what to do with. Come. I made soup for eight hungry men. You are one.\u201d\n\nThe apartment had new curtains she had not asked permission to admire and a plant with leaves the size of someone\u2019s idea of tropical prosperity. Her mother fussed and then sat and then stood and then consented to sit properly, a choreography she would have disapproved of in any other woman. \u201cYour cousin says he saw you on the internet,\u201d she said, rolling the word as if tasting it for poison. \u201cHe says you have a shop where paper pretends to be something. He says your hair looks good and that you have lost weight, which is an insult disguised as admiration. I told him to send me the article and I read it and it made me cry because they wrote \u2018for the dead\u2019 as if the dead were waiting outside in the cold and you let them in. And also because the photo made you look like a person who stands with her feet apart as if expecting something to try her. Do not stand like that always. Your knees will ache.\u201d\n\nThey ate soup and then quince and then the biscuit that acted like a sponge and then, because sentiment insisted, they opened a box in the wardrobe where her mother kept the things she never let anyone believe she had. There were letters from an aunt who had married a man in Canada and discovered that the supermarket could cure certain homesickness and cause others, there was a small packet of paper birds folded by a neighbor with more patience than faith, and there were photographs of Ileana with hair in a fringe that had seemed, at the time, inconspicuous. Her mother pulled out a paper flower, flatter than it had intended to be, yellow dulled to the color of good butter. \u201cWe used these,\u201d she said, turning it over as if expecting medicine on the other side. \u201cWhen sugar was rationed, we decorated with flori din h\u00e2rtie, and when love was rationed we did not. I made them for your grandmother\u2019s icon, and then I stopped because your father called it ridiculous, and I cannot say he was wrong and I cannot forgive him. Eat more. You will find no forgiveness in your mother\u2019s kitchen.\u201d\n\nOn the train back, she wrote a list of things that had to be done before anyone could accuse her of optimism. Buy more tape. Replace kettle cord with a cord that had no interest in heroics. Sign the paper that would let Viorica sell tincture legally in the shop on Thursdays and that would demand eighty euros and a photostated signature from a man in a room over the police station. Teach the class at the institute and prevent the music man from insinuating a violin. Ask the tailor whether his son wanted to learn to cut crepe without frightening it. Ask Marius if it was too early in the year to plant sweet peas against the courtyard fence without insulting the wind.\n\nThe institute class took place in a room so white it reflected intentions back at you. A camera on a tripod watched, patient and unthreatening in the way of predators that prefer to depress rather than chase. Women came in wearing the kind of faces you wear when your salary depends on both delight and suspicion. Ileana demonstrated the cut that turned a flat petal into something that would catch light like a truth; she talked about wire as if it were behavior, and tape as if it could be forgiven for being green, and the room slowly forgot to be impressed with its own whiteness. A woman with a pen that had \u201cEU\u201d near its clip asked why paper and not silk, and Ileana made a joke that was kind and then did not. \u201cBecause of price,\u201d she said simply, \u201cand because my hands grew up with this and I do not need to become another woman to be good at it. Silk demands ceremonies I am done with. Paper is obedient and then suddenly not. It is like people.\u201d The camera caught her hand more honestly than it caught her mouth. Someone, somewhere, would cut the footage into a minute of sincerity for the internet. It didn\u2019t matter. Three women took scissors home and told themselves that a night could be shortened with cut fringe, and that mattered.\n\nOn a Friday that started with a hinge squeaking just to be dramatic, Luminita arrived flanked by two women from the market who wore indignation as if it were perfume gone sweet with age. \u201cThey want to raise the rent,\u201d she announced, and her bracelets hardly made a sound. \u201cThey say we bring nothing but litter and cheap hats. They say tourists get spooked. They would like us at the back by the shoes that are ashamed of themselves.\u201d She produced a notice printed on paper that had cost more than the thought behind it. \u201cSix months,\u201d she said, \u201cand then double. I told the man who told me that I would teach his wife to cut peonies with her nail, and he said he would prefer a raise.\u201d\n\nThe shop became a planning table with tea. Mara wrote on a piece of cardboard with a marker that had minded its cap, not slogans but lists of names\u2014each woman who would care, and each man who would have to be embarrassed into pretending care. Viorica told them which journalist accepted insults with grace and which one insisted you admire his hair before he would lift a pen. The teenager with the scar near his ear volunteered to bring his cousins and made it sound like muscle; the old woman with the white hair said she would come and sit and refuse to be moved and dared them to call the police on her with a look that would have made an ambulance apologize. \u201cWe will sell birds at the edge of their clean aisle,\u201d Ileana said, feeling the brief reheated anger that bureaucracy served, \u201cand we will price them so low that their receipts leak and so high that their eyes water, and we will be inconvenient and insist on it.\u201d\n\nThey were, and it worked in the way that such things work\u2014bluntly, imperfectly, expensively. A councilor whose face was a collection of courtesies appeared with his hands held just high enough to show he carried nothing; he promised a revision, a reconsideration, a respect. He said the word \u201cHeritage\u201d as if he were freighting it for the first time, and Viorica sniffed like a woman with a better dictionary. The notice that came two weeks later was thinner and more smug; it offered a smaller increase and the privilege of staying where they were if they learned to speak kindly about mops. It was victory edited into survival. Luminita took it, put it in her box under the green tape, and said, \u201cGood. I like fights that end with a joke. Next time, we will make a banner. Perhaps with fringe. They will die of laughter and we will count money.\u201d\n\nThe night they got the notice, a storm did the thing they had learned to expect and then it did something else. The lights went down on the entire block, and the usual chorus of complaints rose and then faltered because it was a clean dark, unpunished by sirens. The shop became a cave that had learned polite lighting: beeswax candles, the gold that makes people forgive one another. The birds, freed from the vanity of electricity, moved in a wind that appeared from nowhere and wrote shadows on the wall that looked like a language. A woman who had come to buy a violet stood and cried because she had been waiting to cry for five weeks and this felt like a room that could hold it. A boy found his mother\u2019s hand and was disgusted by himself and did not let go. Marius arrived with a lamp that had known tents and night watchmen and men who loved dogs more reliably than people, and he set it on the counter with the word he used for announcing events that had the decency to be simple. \u201cSnow,\u201d he said in March, and no one argued.\n\nShe bandaged his hand again when the lamp toasted it, an old intimacy made newer by the way he kept his palm open without asking for privacy. The scar on his wrist lay quiet in the candlelight. He looked at her with the expression he reserved for estimating if a branch would fall if asked, and then turned his head because he did not like to make people feel inspected. \u201cI will go to the market with you tomorrow,\u201d he said, which either meant he worried she would fight too hard or worried she would not fight hard enough, and she appreciated the ambiguity as a romance of its own. \u201cBring rope,\u201d he added, as if every situation could be improved by rope, and perhaps he was not wrong.\n\nApril threatened to become a drumroll and then remembered to stay rain. The plane tree put out buds like tiny truths. The hospital called for color because someone in purchasing had decided to allow joy as a line item. The institute sent a photograph of hands working and asked if they could use it in a program that would travel to a small town that believed itself untouched by trends and would welcome the arrival of a good one disguised as a class. The tailor returned with photographs of a baby and the faint panic of men who realize that time is not something they can negotiate with once, successfully, and then dismiss. He asked if paper birds were good luck in Spain; Ileana said yes in the tone that allowed a lie to become true in a room if told confidently.\n\nOne of the boys brought a football to the shop by mistake and saw it as a test of adulthood to pretend he had meant to. He kicked it against the wall and stopped when he saw a bird quiver. \u201cI did not see it,\u201d he said, outraged at gravity\u2019s presumption. \u201cIt did not see you,\u201d Marius answered, not unkindly. \u201cConsider that a peace.\u201d The boy nodded like a man who had come from a meeting and left with notes. He returned the next day with exact change for a single white bell and the face of someone who did not yet understand that buying beauty can be accompanied by the same concentration you use buying bread.\n\nIn between, there were the small stabbings the city administers to prevent complacency from getting uppity. A neighbor left a note about garbage in a handwriting that made the complaint seem older than paper, and then apologized for his own anger with a basket of tomatoes that had learned sweetness somewhere they did not care to admit. The internet argued with itself about whether paper flowers were betrayal or salvation, and Mara wrote replies for sport and then stopped because sport can outgrow pleasure in an afternoon. A woman came and demanded they make fifty red roses for a politician\u2019s wife who had the face of a person who despises mercy; Luminita accepted and priced them high enough to make the woman blink and then return with a compliment.\n\nThere were also gifts that pretended to be accidents. Viorica fainted, briefly, in the apothecary and woke up furious with her blood for attempting melodrama. \u201cI know what caused it,\u201d she said, calling Ileana later with the self-diagnosis of a woman who trusted her own pulse more than any machine. \u201cLack of sugar. And the sight of a man crying in my shop without discipline. We will pretend it is nothing and we will train the jars to be heavy at night so I do not carry them like a girl. Do not bring me pity. Bring me the rosemary with the strong stem. The one you bully.\u201d\n\nIleana brought rosemary and a new ledger because the old one had a spine that had begun to give in, and they wrote in it the simple things that lend dignity to trade: who owed what, who paid, who promised, who would not be asked again. Viorica wrote her name at the top with that neat aggression you associate with primary school teachers and good cooks. \u201cOne day,\u201d she said, matter-of-factly, as if describing the weather issuing from long-range forecast, \u201cI will leave this to someone who can count and will not sell sugar pills to women who need soup. It might be you. It might be the boy with the scar. It will not be the idiot with the blazer who believes in vitamins and nothing else. Do not argue. It is unbecoming.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo argument,\u201d Ileana said, though the thought of becoming apothecary made a small panicked bird in her chest flutter for the exit. \u201cBut do not hurry. The jars prefer you for now.\u201d\n\nEaster came with its eggs pretending to be new planets and its lamb pretending to be innocent. The church bells did the old trick of making the sky feel like a ceiling that had softened. People who resisted sermons came and accepted wax because they wanted to move in a crowd that pretended to know a song. The shop made wreaths with green that did not apologize to winter; they made birds that blushed on purpose; they made lilies that refused funerals for two weeks and then agreed to accompany them because society had to be humored. The old woman with the white hair brought a story about a priest who had tripped and made everyone laugh and forgiving him had saved them all the trouble of inventing love. \u201cDo not look put upon,\u201d she warned the young ones, wrists cocked, \u201cwhen joy asks for a lift. It is heavy and will sit on the floor if you do not insist.\u201d\n\nOne morning, as the river performed its party trick of holding a new sky in parts, a boy from the hospital came into the shop without his mother and with a dignity that refused to be narrated. He was fourteen; his eyes had learned a story that people ten years older told badly. \u201cThe lilies,\u201d he said, not trying to get sympathy with his mouth. \u201cThey helped my grandfather not hate the room.\u201d He coughed, a necessary punctuation. \u201cHe died yesterday, and my mother says she never wants to see them again and also can she keep one. I told her she is allowed both. She is at home and cannot speak to anyone yet. I would like to buy,\u201d he recited, like a sentence copied from a book that had saved him before, \u201cone that looks like it understands that I know two things at the same time.\u201d\n\nThey made him one that would look wrong in any photograph and perfect on a windowsill under a calendar with kittens. He paid with money folded so carefully it had learned new geometry. When he left, Luminita leaned against the counter and shook her hands as if shaking water off, a superstition to prevent feeling from sinking into the bone. \u201cWe do not deserve our jobs,\u201d she muttered to no one in particular and to half the saints on the wall. \u201cAnd yet here we are.\u201d\n\nOn a warm day that promised heat would be a problem again, the boys insisted on showing Marius the knot they had learned to tie on YouTube and that had convinced them that the internet deserved to exist. He watched, slowed it with his fingers, and taught them the other way, the one his grandfather had forced into his hands until it became preference. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, pressing the ends together and tugging, \u201cyou will forget this if you do not use it. Memory is lazy. Put it somewhere it will be forced to work.\u201d To her surprise, he turned to Ileana as if she were another boy with rope and not a woman who made a shop stay honest. \u201cYou are tying your days strangewise,\u201d he said. \u201cMake the loop bigger. Leave yourself a way out. You do not always have to be cleverer than the wind.\u201d\n\nShe nodded, not pretending to understand, and later, at the river, where the gulls had reclaimed their committee status and the taxis performed their mating rituals at the light, she understood. She wrote a list that was not a chain but a series of small generous instructions to herself: one window open; one day for the hospital without charging; one evening without numbers; one white bird for a neighbor whose voice had been rough with no excuse; one lunch eaten sitting down; one hour to watch steam; one call to her mother where she did not defend; one question to Marius that did not require an answer. She tucked the list under the magnet with the picture long gone and felt as if she had been given rope but not told to hang anything with it.\n\nThe day the inspector returned with a second clipboard and a new haircut, he found a class in session and Fleur-de-lis in progress and a woman telling a story about a favor that had, against the rules, been returned. He observed in silence for a minute, then made a note, then adjusted his tie as if to ask permission to speak. \u201cYou have become,\u201d he said gravely, as if awarding a medal, \u201ca place where my daughter is safe to say things I cannot hear in my kitchen. For this I will fine you less than the law allows for your plug. It would be a sin otherwise.\u201d He wrote the amount, which was rude and manageable, and left without taking a bird because the dignity he had retrieved after the first one now clung to him out of loyalty.\n\nBy the time the acacia remembered how to perfume a street without asking permission, they had made a habit of surviving. The shop had a broom that recognized only one corner as its weakness and leaned there between bouts; the scissors developed favorites among the hands that used them; the radio had been allowed in on Wednesdays when Mara\u2019s patience with her own smart jokes wore thin; the kettle grudgingly consented to a new cord and came to terms with a life that involved discipline. The building association surrendered, through neglect, to the trees. The gate and the hinge took the same measure of each other every evening and agreed to call it friendship. The dog learned to sleep where the sun moved. The D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba held the moon badly or brilliantly, depending on its own opinion that night. And on a Tuesday that was no one\u2019s birthday and everyone\u2019s, Ileana stood with her hands empty and then full, and said yes to a class that had asked nothing rude, and then no to a man who wanted to hang plastic, and then carried a pot of basil up the stairs, and thought, with the contentment that can only come from a day that obeyed no one and still turned out, that perhaps this was habit enough to be called a life.",
