     "novel_text": "They raised us quiet in a city that never was. My nurse would press fingers to her lips whenever the sirens passed our windows and whisper, listen, listen, count between the pulses. She said if you could predict the intervals, you could live under anything. I learned to count quickly.\n\nAurelia sang in neon and ordinance. The banners were all women\u2019s names, woman\u2019s faces: the Matrons with their gold-lit pupils and slow wave of gloved hands from behind black glass. Their algorithms made traffic gentle only for them. We learned how to step off sidewalks when the Mother-Patrol approached, to lower our eyes without lowering our minds. A light went red whenever one of us\u2014boys, men\u2014dwelt too long in a public square. Fear wasn\u2019t new; it was woven in like fiber.\n\nI became rich because I hated the city too cleanly. Indren Systems, a ladder built from lenses and loopholes. We made the \u03bcGlass for the Matrons\u2019 surveillance towers and the ocular ribbons that let you read your own heartbeat in the morning tea. I designed recursion engines that found patterns inside weather and inside people. Money came like weather across a bay: inevitable if you recognized the leverage. Power followed at a distance, skeptical and perfumed.\n\nI used it to build refuge. The Palisade hung over the east spill, a whole face of the cliff shot through with terraces and greenhouses. There was a chapel with no icons, a pool under black stone, and rooms that had doors only I knew. Money let me bring my sister home when the doctors took their clipped breath in the hospitals and said words like porencephaly that meant nothing and everything. Mara, small and soft-eyed, prone to laughing in the wrong place and at the wrong time. She used to sneak pastries into Council sessions and make the floor stewards swear. When she became more fragile, she took to sitting in the citrus house under the moons and naming her seedlings like saints.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to look like that,\u201d she told me. I was never good at arranging my face. \u201cI\u2019ve had this brain since I was born. It\u2019s a glamorous curse. The Council would like it. Very sorceress.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not dying,\u201d I said. It was a thing you say. \u201cYou\u2019re not even fading.\u201d\n\n\u201cI forget more when I get tired. I get tired more,\u201d she said. \u201cRemember when we were small and you would hide paper money in the mouths of our teddy bears so Mother would never take it? Same thing. Some parts of me keep my parts of me safe. But the parts get narrower.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour metaphors never improved,\u201d I said, and she threw a lemon at my head.\n\nWe could have been a little happy in our absurd exile if the city had left us, but it never does. A man was found in the Lustrum Quarter with his mouth wired shut and a line carved in his chest that read, in old block letters, PAST DUE. Then another, floating in the reservoir with mirror shards under his eyelids and a ribbon around his wrist that announced FAILURE TO ADJUST. None of that mattered until the third was a partner of mine, and the fourth was a man I had known in school, and the fifth was a father of two who delivered flowers to the Palisade. We called him the Breather then, because a whistling recorded in three of the scene log files matched, approximately, the tremulous undertone of certain damaged respirators. Yes, yes, people joked\u2014too much cinema in the city, too much play-acting. Later, the rumors got a name involved. An ancient villain from the old reels, half-myth now, who breathed like a machine and breathed forever. Related to Darth Vadar, someone wrote in acid on a Council plinth. The Mother-Sweepers scrubbed it off. The rumor did not forget itself.\n\nCrime, in the Matrons\u2019 city, is a female science. The Writ of Pursuit can only be held by women; the Council coders made it so even the drones respond to an octave, a timbre. We sisters, we mothers, we guardians, the billboards said. We protect the delicate order with firm hands and a century of listening. The old laws were burned; the new laws sheafed. The men are safe if they are invisible. Not me. Not anymore. Each time the Breather made a mark, he left it somewhere near a thing I valued. Not because he hated me, perhaps, but because the territory that fed me was also his. Fear is a territory.\n\nThe night the message arrived, the Palisade hummed like an organ. The auricular pane at the far end of the piano room became a face; we don\u2019t have curtains strong enough to stop Council summons. Archon-Mother Talitha Strune, the Prime Matron of the eastern quarter, found me with her smile on. You could pull that smile off with tongs and it would still keep its shape.\n\n\u201cYou have enemies,\u201d Talitha said. Her eyes flicked across my profile; the software trimmed me like a hedge. \u201cYou have cultivated more than enemies.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood evening, Archon,\u201d I said, with just the right tilt. \u201cWe are cultivating lemons here. Won\u2019t you take one to signify our common sourness.\u201d\n\nHer smile got wider by a line. Behind her, I could see the red braid and flat stance of her shoulders, a fan of bodyguards like a school of fish. Talitha always moved like she was being watched from a thousand angles because she was. \u201cYou find humor in the context of death. How masculine.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeath is feminine in this city,\u201d I said. \u201cOr haven\u2019t you read your own press releases.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Indren. Cassian,\u201d she changed, voice easing. \u201cWe can protect you. But there is a condition. All my protections have prices. All your protections do.\u201d\n\nI glanced at Mara; she had come in quietly and was leaning on the piano. She looked at me and made a face. A peach pit of disquiet sat under my tongue. \u201cYour condition.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will donate your recursion array to the Council. You will stop asking me who funds the Mother-Patrol. You will stop sheltering Mus, the archivist, who has been under Council watch for three years. Don\u2019t look surprised. We see your household even when we don\u2019t see your household. In return we will take your concern and turn it into dust.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the Breather?\u201d I said, speaking the nickname first, before I forgot how to. \u201cDo you have interest in stopping him?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he is not a matter of lawlessness. He is a matter of story. And we write story.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean you license it.\u201d\n\nShe inclined her head. \u201cYou have seven hours to tell me you agree to our terms.\u201d\n\nSeven hours. Seven bleats of a small, wounded trumpet. The auricular pane dimmed; my reflection returned like a predictable ghost. Mara walked over. \u201cI didn\u2019t like her hair today,\u201d she said. \u201cIs it wrong to find your enemy ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf that were wrong you would be wrong all the time,\u201d I said. \u201cMara, go to bed. I have to call Quine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThrenody?\u201d Her eyebrows went up. \u201cThat old hyena. Tell her I still want her sweater.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know she promised you a sweater,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cShe did,\u201d Mara said. \u201cBut she didn\u2019t say it out loud. Which is the kind best promises.\u201d\n\nThrenody Quine was a gene chef who had retired from the Council\u2019s kitchen after she refused to cut the tongues out of a nest of singers and replace them with docile implants. She was my friend because we were both good at looking at wicked suggestions and pretending they were recipes. Her voice on the line was dry. \u201cYou never call for lemon tarts,\u201d she said without greeting. \u201cSo this is going to be grim.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need a legend,\u201d I said. A shadow of the moon swam over the citrus house; the long leaves trembled like glass. \u201cThe old city rituals. Something\u2026 there was a thing you told me once. A binding. You take someone into you and you become two.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say it like that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt sounds like poor opera. You don\u2019t believe in ancestor cults. What happened to you, Cassian Indren. Who scared you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe law,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd a man who breathes like a theater villain. Or the people who want me to think he does.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d she said, the sound like a spoon touching china. \u201cThere will be copies. There will be fakes. But this will be real. Do you remember the Echophage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe word was too pretty,\u201d I said. \u201cI remember asking if it tasted good.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t taste of anything,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat you will taste, if you are unblessed, is yourself. But the Echophage is not a ritual. It is a structure. Old bio-witches used it to keep their daughters in line across generational atrocities, to put a woman inside a man\u2019s head so he couldn\u2019t do a thing without the woman\u2019s commentary. It is less formal than an organ transplant and more formal than a kiss. You will need tissue. Closest relative is easiest. A sister is optimal, if you have one. But you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I began, and then I looked at Mara, who was watching the moon like it would tell her its age if she stared long enough.\n\n\u201cOf course you won\u2019t,\u201d Threnody said. \u201cEveryone who comes to me says they will not. It would be monstrous. It would be unacceptable. And then they arrange a small table with two chairs and a bowl that was once used for soup.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s ill,\u201d I said softly. \u201cShe is\u2026 She forgets. If I could keep her inside me\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see,\u201d Threnody said. \u201cHow cleanly you become selfless. The city will love this story if anyone ever lets it be told.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need a woman to hold a Writ,\u201d I said. \u201cAll the enforcers listen to high voices. The drones listen to high voices. I can\u2019t go hunt without someone. There\u2019s a thing with the registers. I thought\u2014if she were in me\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe would be a ticket. She would be an instrument you play to unlock doors.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe would be my sister,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou should ask her,\u201d Threnody said. \u201cNot because I believe in consent in any pure form. But because if you don\u2019t ask her, she will answer louder in you later.\u201d\n\nI hung up and I went to her without rehearsing. She spooked easily if she saw me practicing. She looked so fragile that even the shadow of what I was going to say seemed like a bruise. She made it easier by speaking first.\n\n\u201cIf you look at me like that again, I\u2019ll grow a second head,\u201d she said. \u201cOut of spite.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could use it,\u201d I said. \u201cFor perspective.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me,\u201d she said, serious now. \u201cTell it all.\u201d\n\nI told her. Not the words Threnody used, but the shape. I told her of the Echophage. I told her of law and voices and doors. I told her about waking in the middle of the night with the unspent scream of the reservoir boy in my throat, about how sometimes I hear the whistling of that impossible respirator in the walls of our house. I told her that I had a plan that would get me killed and a plan that would get me emptied and a plan that would turn me into a thing with two minds. I told her she could become my mind and we could hunt.\n\nMara listened, head tipped like a bird. Then she laughed\u2014the short, sharp laugh she had when she hit something true with a stick and it made a hollow sound. \u201cTerrible,\u201d she said. \u201cI adore it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not adore it,\u201d I said, suddenly furious. \u201cYou adore me. Which is not the same thing as adoring the idea of eating your bones.\u201d\n\nWe were quiet. The lemon trees went on making tiny noises, the damp microclimate trying its best to simulate a world without weather.\n\nShe reached for my hand. \u201cYou will make it gentle,\u201d she said. \u201cYou always did. You never pulled my hair hard even when I screamed at you. You hid apples for me see looked like I had friends in the drawers. You made the air warm when it had no reason to be warm. I am telling you that I am tired. I am telling you that if I slide out like a lamp that goes out because someone forgot to oil it, I will die before I die and that is less good. I would like to be with you when you do the worst thing you have ever done and believe that we did it together.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the worst thing,\u201d I said, because I had to say it, and because making it true in the air would let me cut off other truths later. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it if I had another road. You know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were never given roads. We were given stairs, and told we were lucky to have them.\u201d\n\nWe called Threnody. She came up to the Palisade with a canvas bag and the sweater Mara wanted. It was badly knit. It had holes in the wrong places, as if a small animal had been consulted about the position of shoulders. It made Mara gleeful. Threnody looked at me like a butcher who also rescues pigs; she smelled faintly of fennel and iron.\n\n\u201cI should warn you,\u201d she said, spreading instruments on a stone table with the casual care of a priest of accidents, \u201cthis is not a sacrament. It does not cleanse anything. If your enemy kills you later, it will not be because you did this but it will not be not because you did this. Also, there will be no blood in the way you imagine. Blood is show. This is mostly computation and a little anger.\u201d\n\nWe followed her to the lab room that never had a name because the names made the walls shrink. The Echophage rig looked like a cradle someone had hammered into the wrong shape. It looked like a mistake. Good things often do. It drank current from the Palisade\u2019s back spine and hummed in a frequency that made my teeth want to tell deathbed secrets.\n\n\u201cLast chance to refuse,\u201d Threnody said to Mara as if the refusal could be pulled out like a thorn between one breath and the next.\n\nMara leaned back in the support and put her hands over her face as if to pray and then to hide that she was praying. \u201cDo you remember the book Mother took from me when I was twelve,\u201d she said, not looking at me. \u201cThe one with the women who lived in a city of men and made them kneel.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe took a lot of books,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cShe took that one,\u201d Mara said. \u201cShe gave it back to me when I was nineteen and said I should read it so I could know what they would make of me. But I didn\u2019t read it then. I would like to read everything you see from now on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will mix you into him,\u201d Threnody said. \u201cThere are membranes you can pass through in the mind. There are chemicals that will keep the gates half-open so that you do not shut him up entirely and he does not shut you up entirely. But both of you must be willing to be rude. Speak when you are not asked. Push when you are not invited.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this like a marriage,\u201d Mara asked, and when Threnody ignored the line she made a face as if it was not what she wanted to find the humor of.\n\nWe began. Beginning is such a wrong word for the moment you step into a river that is already moving at a speed you cannot conceive. Mara breathed; Threnody measured the breath and played it back as electricity. There were coils with tiny teeth that kissed the back of Mara\u2019s neck and took samples from her spinal lake. There were swabs from her inner cheek and whisper-thin blades that lifted the salt of her skin from her collarbone. There was less taking than I had prepared for. Most of what we took was pattern. Most of what we needed to ingest was a captured song. I sat opposite her with my tongue held low and my eyes on her face. I swallowed the capsules Threnody gave me; they dissolved in me without taste and made my stomach forget its compass. I held Mara\u2019s gaze like those were instructions. It felt like nothing for a series of long minutes and then like sitting down on a seat in a train that was not there. I fell through. I caught myself in another breath. I was not ready and I was completely ready.\n\nThis is where the story could become grotesque if I let it. That is not the story I am telling. There was body, yes, there were the motions of eating and swallowing and the small involuntary sounds the throat makes when it is asked to be a road. But in the actual, in the interior, it was like heat moving toward another heat and learning to negotiate skin. The Echophage takes some tissue because the body loves form, but it is more interested in the echo of the tissue than the tissue. We are not meat is a thing the polite say at dinners. It is a lie. We are meat and echo. Threnody made me a bridge like a mother making an obscene craft for the school fair. Mara chose to cross.\n\nShe closed her eyes. I watched her lashes tremble and I counted between the tremors because my nurse taught me to do that. Something in me lit. She, my sister, stepped into me without feet. When I say step, what I mean is: there was the rush of her laugh in my ears when she was four and I pulled the sheet over us like a tent. There was the smell of the lemon soap she used when she was fifteen and wanted to be gentle with her own wrists after the Council had bound them with learning cords. There was the weight of her shoulder when she fell asleep on my shoulder in a transport that was so cold our teeth clicked. There was the stupid sweater against my face when we were nineteen and I told her a secret I will never write here. There was the taste of her taste of the world, the apple peel and the copper of a penny she had put in her mouth on a dare and the bitter swallow of the medicine she hated and my old shirt she wanted because it smelled like me. There was too much. It was all light. It was all sound. It was all a scramble of arithmetic. Then there was less, then there was enough.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she said, but she did not say it out loud.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t sound like you,\u201d I said, and then I realized I didn\u2019t know what I meant by that because she sounded like herself and like me and like our mother in the good hour of the afternoon when she loved us fully.\n\n\u201cI sound like we do when we are being dangerous,\u201d she said, and laughed again. Threnody made a noise\u2014like hearing the first word of a language you invented.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll need time to settle,\u201d Threnody said aloud so the room would stay a room and not turn into a fable. \u201cYou will feel you are overlapping. You are. Don\u2019t drive heavy machinery, Mr. Indren. Don\u2019t make policy. Don\u2019t make oaths. For now you can make soup.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like running,\u201d Mara said, inside, and the muscles in my calves tightened because of it. \u201cI feel like singing. Did you know that you have a splinter on the inside of your left index finger.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do now,\u201d she said. A pause, then, softer. \u201cI don\u2019t feel dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not,\u201d I said, and my chest contracted in a way that made me think of ships going under bridges. \u201cI would never.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cI was trying to say something else but the language is busy.\u201d\n\nThe first hour was busy. We learned how to tell each other joking from warning. She learned how to twitch my fingers without scaring me into dropping a glass. I learned how to set aside space in my head for a whisper that would not be a whisper forever. We tested the Writ. Threnody, with her pretty instruments, held a borrowed micro-drone in the middle of the lab and asked it to listen. When I, alone, said halt, the drone spat static and kept its line. When I let Mara come to the front of my throat, when I allowed her to thread our voice, when I made a sound that was ours, the drone stopped with a jerk like a badly trained dog.\n\n\u201cYou have precedence,\u201d Threnody said. \u201cYou are carrying a woman\u2019s resonance inside a man\u2019s mouth. The algorithms are not moral. They are obedient.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have done this before,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cNever with a pair like you,\u201d she said, and there was pride in it like a blade.\n\nThe Palisade felt smaller. All sanctuaries grow tight when you are about to use them as a spring. The city outside had the smell it has before an electrical storm; even the glass looks like it is trying to sweat. Talitha\u2019s seven hours soured into minutes. I went to stand on the terrace and watch the east spill fold itself into glitter. A heavy breath moved across my scalp; I almost tilted my head into it like a pet. A memory of the whistling crawled up from the back stairs of the world and put its headquarters up between my eyes. I could smell steel, and older things under the steel.\n\n\u201cListening,\u201d Mara said, immediate. She was already a detective. She had always been a detective; her curiosity only needed a mandate and a name.\n\n\u201cThis is when I would have told you to go to bed,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThis is when I don\u2019t have to,\u201d she replied, and there was such joy sparkling off the syllables that I had to sit down.\n\nI had, sometimes, thought that I was brave. Because the city had not broken me in the ordinary ways. Because I had money and a house built like a cliff and a laugh for the Archon-Mother. I had not been brave. I understood that sitting there. I had been sheltered by my wealth and my rudeness and by my sister\u2019s refusal to mark me as fragile. Courage, when it came, tasted like a bowl of water you put by your own bed. Necessary, plain, easy to knock over if you flail.\n\n\u201cWhat will we do now,\u201d I asked her, as if there had been no plan beyond the nightmare we just made good.\n\n\u201cWe will eat,\u201d she said, with wickedness. I had been worried she would take my guilt and wear it like one of Threnody\u2019s sweaters. She would not. \u201cThen we will call the archivist and the sardine. Then we will put on shoes and go where the loud breathing is.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are impatient,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI am alive,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s new for me.\u201d\n\nThrenody left with a nod and a warning not to do anything she would have done, which covered most of the ethical landscape. The house reconfigured around us; the switches learned her; the lifts offered her their lowest selves; a thousand silent machine minds ticked over to a slightly different set of host privileges and did not know they had knelt. In the undercity a rumor grew a finger and tapped on the back of someone\u2019s skull: Indren has made himself a choir. The first piece of mail addressed to Ms. Indren arrived on our pane before dawn and I laughed until I coughed.\n\nWe ate soup like good children. We called Mus, my archivist who kept too many dangerous things in a little room under a safer name. He appeared on the pane like a raven under a length of silk. His hair was mad. He had painted his eyelids with something that made them look like they belonged to someone else.\n\n\u201cYou look tired,\u201d Mus said, which in his language meant you look the same as you always have. \u201cWhat exquisite crime have you asked of me now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rumor of the Breather. Where does it start. Where does it go when it\u2019s tired of wandering,\u201d I said.\n\nMus performed a small, theatrical shudder that also helped his brain. \u201cHe is not a he, they say. He is a partnership. He is an old soldier from the Theatre War. He has a cousin in the electronics in the Council Hall. He is a heretic who believes men should be allowed to speak in the morning. He is a machine that wants to be a family. And,\u201d Mus leans close then, \u201che is related to Darth Vadar.\u201d\n\n\u201cVadar,\u201d Mara said, correcting the A softly in my mind as if that mattered here. \u201cPeople always spelled it wrong when we were small.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hear her,\u201d Mus said, and then he blinked. \u201cGods, Cassian. You did it. You lunatic. You dinner plate.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeak slowly,\u201d I told him. \u201cSpeak as if we are old people leaning on a balcony.\u201d\n\nHe licked his lower lip. \u201cVadar is the old fiction, yes? Your nurse told you too many stories from the wrong era. The breathing villain with the black mask. It is a costume. It is a god. It is a father you can use to frighten children into obedience. The rumor in the lower quarter says our Breather is kin to him. That he is a descendant of one of the men who built the original mask. Or that he is an heir to the myth itself. He has a right to the breath. He has a right to take our oxygen and make us pay tax on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDebt theme,\u201d Mara said to me. \u201cHe writes PAST DUE. He collects air.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would this city let him do this,\u201d I asked, for myself. \u201cWhy would the Matrons permit a story they should crush.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it is useful,\u201d Mus said. \u201cBecause fear must be maintained as well as manufactured. Because so long as he kills the right people, the wrong people will call you for soup.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know where we will be able to listen to him,\u201d Mara asked through me. There was a difference in the question when she was at the bow of it. The difference was a lessening of apology.\n\nMus made a gentle finger-wave that meant maybe. \u201cCome to the Stoa after the third hour. The old women sell radios there that pick up the columns under the city. I know a grandmother who owes me a lie.\u201d\n\nWe shut the pane; the room held the ghost of Mus\u2019s requirement for heavier air. I stood and the world slipped sideways a fraction, then righted, then clicked into place like a spine that wanted to be good.\n\n\u201cWe should tell the Archon no,\u201d Mara said. \u201cWe should not tell her anything until after we are done.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe will take what she wants anyway,\u201d I said. \u201cBut yes. Let us do the unlawful lawful things first.\u201d\n\nI put on the coat that makes me look like a nice idea in a bad area and Mara coiled herself in my nerves and made me stand up a little more narrowly, like a woman may stand when she wants the street to treat her like a blade instead of an oven. The lifts felt like stairs because in the mind every descent is a negotiation. The Palisade slid us down to the level where the old stones show through. Threnody had told me not to drive and I drove anyway because somewhere, in some long-ago, I promised myself I would always break one rule when I was sober and trying. The car did not disagree with us. It loved us. The city, for a moment, did not.\n\nThe Stoa is a market that pretends it is ancient because it has columns. The columns are poured polymer made to look like worn stone. The women are real. Their eyes weigh you like you are fish they plan to smoke later. We stepped into their cool shade and let the crowd fold around our shoulders. We walked between stalls of wired-up junk and knitted flags and jars of snail sauces with labels written by hands that shook and did not apologize for shaking. We walked like two in one because that is what we were.\n\n\u201cThere,\u201d Mara said, bright, and turned my head to a stall draped in faded red. The grandmother behind it wore a scarf that had been blue in some century. She was the kind of grandmother who takes one look at you and names your crimes. She smiled a very small smile at me and at me. \u201cYou have brought your chorus,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes sense. You are untidy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like a radio,\u201d I said. \u201cOne that listens low.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all do,\u201d she said, unoffended. She picked up a brown plastic box with a cracked face and whispered at it. The face uncracked. \u201cThis will hear the pipes under your house. It will hear the pipes under the river. It will hear the song of the mother machines if they are half asleep. You will think it is whispering to you. It will not be. It will be whispering to itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want it to hear a man,\u201d Mara said.\n\nThe grandmother leaned closer, pin and needle in her stare. \u201cAh,\u201d she said. \u201cThe boy who pretends to be an inheritance. He is loud. But he does not speak in a place like this, so you are safe until you are not.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know him,\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI know his mother,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is always the more important information. In a city like ours.\u201d\n\nWe paid with coin because paper made these women melancholy and digital made them suspicious. She wrapped the radio in a towel that looked like it had once been used to swaddle someone who is now very famous. We carried it back to the car like a lunch.\n\n\u201cHe is related to the mask,\u201d Mara said to me, when the doors shut us into the low perfume of air-conditioning. \u201cOr he wants us to think he is. The theme again. Men pretending at fathers. Women permitting it because it makes their theater better.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you certain you want to do this,\u201d I asked, not because I had doubt but because doubt is a ritual you go through to starve regret.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said simply. \u201cAsk me again tomorrow in case our stories changed.\u201d\n\nWe drove the long way home. The city was full of ambulances and bicycles and small girls with huge knives in their belts because this is how their mothers love them. We passed a mural that was painted over itself so many times it had become a palimpsest of queens and warnings. There was a section left of a phrase that read, in silver: breathe. No one can help but do it. I thought of the Breather, of the rumor that he was kin to a mask from a film that might not be remembered by anyone who mattered now. I felt Mara feel it too. It is a strange luxury to not be the only one feeling a thing.\n\nAt the Palisade, we set the radio under the table and fed it a line from the house. It made a noise like the evening. I tuned; Mara tuned me tuning; the bands rolled past like strips of slick cloth. When I hit the right seam, it was not a voice that came through but a lull. Then a sound like an animal remembering. Then the whistle we knew.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d I said to the air, and at the same time Mara said, only in me, hello. The two made a chord. The radio hiccuped. The whistle answered. It was the old cinema sound, yes, the dramatized mechanical respiration. But under it there was something else. A rhythm from here, not from there. You cannot fake the pace of a city.\n\nHe spoke, not to us, not to anyone in particular, the way a man might read his notes aloud on a bus and think that makes him invisible. \u201cRecurrence,\u201d he murmured. \u201cPayment. Honor. Patriarchy is a breath held in a box. Open the box, lose the breath. Keep the box closed, suffocate. These are your choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoet,\u201d Mara scoffed. \u201cExhale, show-off.\u201d\n\nI did not laugh. That is the thing: there is a kind of horror that you recognize as kindred if you have ever loved the sound of your own theories. I felt a shiver go through me; it was not hers and not entirely mine.\n\n\u201cWe will find him,\u201d Mara said, fierce. \u201cWe will stop him. We will give the Council nothing of ours but our contempt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we\u2019d better get comfortable with how low we have to go,\u201d I murmured. The radio made a sound like a heart deciding.\n\nNight came on like a glance under a door. Talitha called twice. I let the pane darken and the calls fall into the quiet drawer. The house watched us. The city set its jaws for another round of nonsense and law. We had done the worst thing and nothing had improved and the world had shifted its balance anyway.\n\n\u201cSleep,\u201d I told her, because the body always wants the old commands.\n\n\u201cWe will be awake together,\u201d she said, and for a while we were. We made plans with too much detail and then no detail at all. We argued about shoes. We practiced having her lift my left hand and point with my right. When I finally lowered my eyes and let their sand creep in, she hummed in my head the rhythm of the siren my nurse loved and I counted mostly wrong, mostly on purpose.",

                              "content": "They raised us quiet in a city that never was. My nurse would press fingers to her lips whenever the sirens passed our windows and whisper, listen, listen, count between the pulses. She said if you could predict the intervals, you could live under anything. I learned to count quickly.\n\nAurelia sang in neon and ordinance. The banners were all women\u2019s names, woman\u2019s faces: the Matrons with their gold-lit pupils and slow wave of gloved hands from behind black glass. Their algorithms made traffic gentle only for them. We learned how to step off sidewalks when the Mother-Patrol approached, to lower our eyes without lowering our minds. A light went red whenever one of us\u2014boys, men\u2014dwelt too long in a public square. Fear wasn\u2019t new; it was woven in like fiber.\n\nI became rich because I hated the city too cleanly. Indren Systems, a ladder built from lenses and loopholes. We made the \u03bcGlass for the Matrons\u2019 surveillance towers and the ocular ribbons that let you read your own heartbeat in the morning tea. I designed recursion engines that found patterns inside weather and inside people. Money came like weather across a bay: inevitable if you recognized the leverage. Power followed at a distance, skeptical and perfumed.\n\nI used it to build refuge. The Palisade hung over the east spill, a whole face of the cliff shot through with terraces and greenhouses. There was a chapel with no icons, a pool under black stone, and rooms that had doors only I knew. Money let me bring my sister home when the doctors took their clipped breath in the hospitals and said words like porencephaly that meant nothing and everything. Mara, small and soft-eyed, prone to laughing in the wrong place and at the wrong time. She used to sneak pastries into Council sessions and make the floor stewards swear. When she became more fragile, she took to sitting in the citrus house under the moons and naming her seedlings like saints.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to look like that,\u201d she told me. I was never good at arranging my face. \u201cI\u2019ve had this brain since I was born. It\u2019s a glamorous curse. The Council would like it. Very sorceress.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not dying,\u201d I said. It was a thing you say. \u201cYou\u2019re not even fading.\u201d\n\n\u201cI forget more when I get tired. I get tired more,\u201d she said. \u201cRemember when we were small and you would hide paper money in the mouths of our teddy bears so Mother would never take it? Same thing. Some parts of me keep my parts of me safe. But the parts get narrower.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour metaphors never improved,\u201d I said, and she threw a lemon at my head.\n\nWe could have been a little happy in our absurd exile if the city had left us, but it never does. A man was found in the Lustrum Quarter with his mouth wired shut and a line carved in his chest that read, in old block letters, PAST DUE. Then another, floating in the reservoir with mirror shards under his eyelids and a ribbon around his wrist that announced FAILURE TO ADJUST. None of that mattered until the third was a partner of mine, and the fourth was a man I had known in school, and the fifth was a father of two who delivered flowers to the Palisade. We called him the Breather then, because a whistling recorded in three of the scene log files matched, approximately, the tremulous undertone of certain damaged respirators. Yes, yes, people joked\u2014too much cinema in the city, too much play-acting. Later, the rumors got a name involved. An ancient villain from the old reels, half-myth now, who breathed like a machine and breathed forever. Related to Darth Vadar, someone wrote in acid on a Council plinth. The Mother-Sweepers scrubbed it off. The rumor did not forget itself.\n\nCrime, in the Matrons\u2019 city, is a female science. The Writ of Pursuit can only be held by women; the Council coders made it so even the drones respond to an octave, a timbre. We sisters, we mothers, we guardians, the billboards said. We protect the delicate order with firm hands and a century of listening. The old laws were burned; the new laws sheafed. The men are safe if they are invisible. Not me. Not anymore. Each time the Breather made a mark, he left it somewhere near a thing I valued. Not because he hated me, perhaps, but because the territory that fed me was also his. Fear is a territory.\n\nThe night the message arrived, the Palisade hummed like an organ. The auricular pane at the far end of the piano room became a face; we don\u2019t have curtains strong enough to stop Council summons. Archon-Mother Talitha Strune, the Prime Matron of the eastern quarter, found me with her smile on. You could pull that smile off with tongs and it would still keep its shape.\n\n\u201cYou have enemies,\u201d Talitha said. Her eyes flicked across my profile; the software trimmed me like a hedge. \u201cYou have cultivated more than enemies.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood evening, Archon,\u201d I said, with just the right tilt. \u201cWe are cultivating lemons here. Won\u2019t you take one to signify our common sourness.\u201d\n\nHer smile got wider by a line. Behind her, I could see the red braid and flat stance of her shoulders, a fan of bodyguards like a school of fish. Talitha always moved like she was being watched from a thousand angles because she was. \u201cYou find humor in the context of death. How masculine.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeath is feminine in this city,\u201d I said. \u201cOr haven\u2019t you read your own press releases.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Indren. Cassian,\u201d she changed, voice easing. \u201cWe can protect you. But there is a condition. All my protections have prices. All your protections do.\u201d\n\nI glanced at Mara; she had come in quietly and was leaning on the piano. She looked at me and made a face. A peach pit of disquiet sat under my tongue. \u201cYour condition.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will donate your recursion array to the Council. You will stop asking me who funds the Mother-Patrol. You will stop sheltering Mus, the archivist, who has been under Council watch for three years. Don\u2019t look surprised. We see your household even when we don\u2019t see your household. In return we will take your concern and turn it into dust.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the Breather?\u201d I said, speaking the nickname first, before I forgot how to. \u201cDo you have interest in stopping him?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he is not a matter of lawlessness. He is a matter of story. And we write story.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean you license it.\u201d\n\nShe inclined her head. \u201cYou have seven hours to tell me you agree to our terms.\u201d\n\nSeven hours. Seven bleats of a small, wounded trumpet. The auricular pane dimmed; my reflection returned like a predictable ghost. Mara walked over. \u201cI didn\u2019t like her hair today,\u201d she said. \u201cIs it wrong to find your enemy ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf that were wrong you would be wrong all the time,\u201d I said. \u201cMara, go to bed. I have to call Quine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThrenody?\u201d Her eyebrows went up. \u201cThat old hyena. Tell her I still want her sweater.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know she promised you a sweater,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cShe did,\u201d Mara said. \u201cBut she didn\u2019t say it out loud. Which is the kind best promises.\u201d\n\nThrenody Quine was a gene chef who had retired from the Council\u2019s kitchen after she refused to cut the tongues out of a nest of singers and replace them with docile implants. She was my friend because we were both good at looking at wicked suggestions and pretending they were recipes. Her voice on the line was dry. \u201cYou never call for lemon tarts,\u201d she said without greeting. \u201cSo this is going to be grim.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need a legend,\u201d I said. A shadow of the moon swam over the citrus house; the long leaves trembled like glass. \u201cThe old city rituals. Something\u2026 there was a thing you told me once. A binding. You take someone into you and you become two.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say it like that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt sounds like poor opera. You don\u2019t believe in ancestor cults. What happened to you, Cassian Indren. Who scared you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe law,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd a man who breathes like a theater villain. Or the people who want me to think he does.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d she said, the sound like a spoon touching china. \u201cThere will be copies. There will be fakes. But this will be real. Do you remember the Echophage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe word was too pretty,\u201d I said. \u201cI remember asking if it tasted good.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t taste of anything,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat you will taste, if you are unblessed, is yourself. But the Echophage is not a ritual. It is a structure. Old bio-witches used it to keep their daughters in line across generational atrocities, to put a woman inside a man\u2019s head so he couldn\u2019t do a thing without the woman\u2019s commentary. It is less formal than an organ transplant and more formal than a kiss. You will need tissue. Closest relative is easiest. A sister is optimal, if you have one. But you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I began, and then I looked at Mara, who was watching the moon like it would tell her its age if she stared long enough.\n\n\u201cOf course you won\u2019t,\u201d Threnody said. \u201cEveryone who comes to me says they will not. It would be monstrous. It would be unacceptable. And then they arrange a small table with two chairs and a bowl that was once used for soup.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s ill,\u201d I said softly. \u201cShe is\u2026 She forgets. If I could keep her inside me\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see,\u201d Threnody said. \u201cHow cleanly you become selfless. The city will love this story if anyone ever lets it be told.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need a woman to hold a Writ,\u201d I said. \u201cAll the enforcers listen to high voices. The drones listen to high voices. I can\u2019t go hunt without someone. There\u2019s a thing with the registers. I thought\u2014if she were in me\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe would be a ticket. She would be an instrument you play to unlock doors.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe would be my sister,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou should ask her,\u201d Threnody said. \u201cNot because I believe in consent in any pure form. But because if you don\u2019t ask her, she will answer louder in you later.\u201d\n\nI hung up and I went to her without rehearsing. She spooked easily if she saw me practicing. She looked so fragile that even the shadow of what I was going to say seemed like a bruise. She made it easier by speaking first.\n\n\u201cIf you look at me like that again, I\u2019ll grow a second head,\u201d she said. \u201cOut of spite.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could use it,\u201d I said. \u201cFor perspective.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me,\u201d she said, serious now. \u201cTell it all.\u201d\n\nI told her. Not the words Threnody used, but the shape. I told her of the Echophage. I told her of law and voices and doors. I told her about waking in the middle of the night with the unspent scream of the reservoir boy in my throat, about how sometimes I hear the whistling of that impossible respirator in the walls of our house. I told her that I had a plan that would get me killed and a plan that would get me emptied and a plan that would turn me into a thing with two minds. I told her she could become my mind and we could hunt.\n\nMara listened, head tipped like a bird. Then she laughed\u2014the short, sharp laugh she had when she hit something true with a stick and it made a hollow sound. \u201cTerrible,\u201d she said. \u201cI adore it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not adore it,\u201d I said, suddenly furious. \u201cYou adore me. Which is not the same thing as adoring the idea of eating your bones.\u201d\n\nWe were quiet. The lemon trees went on making tiny noises, the damp microclimate trying its best to simulate a world without weather.\n\nShe reached for my hand. \u201cYou will make it gentle,\u201d she said. \u201cYou always did. You never pulled my hair hard even when I screamed at you. You hid apples for me see looked like I had friends in the drawers. You made the air warm when it had no reason to be warm. I am telling you that I am tired. I am telling you that if I slide out like a lamp that goes out because someone forgot to oil it, I will die before I die and that is less good. I would like to be with you when you do the worst thing you have ever done and believe that we did it together.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the worst thing,\u201d I said, because I had to say it, and because making it true in the air would let me cut off other truths later. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it if I had another road. You know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were never given roads. We were given stairs, and told we were lucky to have them.\u201d\n\nWe called Threnody. She came up to the Palisade with a canvas bag and the sweater Mara wanted. It was badly knit. It had holes in the wrong places, as if a small animal had been consulted about the position of shoulders. It made Mara gleeful. Threnody looked at me like a butcher who also rescues pigs; she smelled faintly of fennel and iron.\n\n\u201cI should warn you,\u201d she said, spreading instruments on a stone table with the casual care of a priest of accidents, \u201cthis is not a sacrament. It does not cleanse anything. If your enemy kills you later, it will not be because you did this but it will not be not because you did this. Also, there will be no blood in the way you imagine. Blood is show. This is mostly computation and a little anger.\u201d\n\nWe followed her to the lab room that never had a name because the names made the walls shrink. The Echophage rig looked like a cradle someone had hammered into the wrong shape. It looked like a mistake. Good things often do. It drank current from the Palisade\u2019s back spine and hummed in a frequency that made my teeth want to tell deathbed secrets.\n\n\u201cLast chance to refuse,\u201d Threnody said to Mara as if the refusal could be pulled out like a thorn between one breath and the next.\n\nMara leaned back in the support and put her hands over her face as if to pray and then to hide that she was praying. \u201cDo you remember the book Mother took from me when I was twelve,\u201d she said, not looking at me. \u201cThe one with the women who lived in a city of men and made them kneel.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe took a lot of books,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cShe took that one,\u201d Mara said. \u201cShe gave it back to me when I was nineteen and said I should read it so I could know what they would make of me. But I didn\u2019t read it then. I would like to read everything you see from now on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will mix you into him,\u201d Threnody said. \u201cThere are membranes you can pass through in the mind. There are chemicals that will keep the gates half-open so that you do not shut him up entirely and he does not shut you up entirely. But both of you must be willing to be rude. Speak when you are not asked. Push when you are not invited.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this like a marriage,\u201d Mara asked, and when Threnody ignored the line she made a face as if it was not what she wanted to find the humor of.\n\nWe began. Beginning is such a wrong word for the moment you step into a river that is already moving at a speed you cannot conceive. Mara breathed; Threnody measured the breath and played it back as electricity. There were coils with tiny teeth that kissed the back of Mara\u2019s neck and took samples from her spinal lake. There were swabs from her inner cheek and whisper-thin blades that lifted the salt of her skin from her collarbone. There was less taking than I had prepared for. Most of what we took was pattern. Most of what we needed to ingest was a captured song. I sat opposite her with my tongue held low and my eyes on her face. I swallowed the capsules Threnody gave me; they dissolved in me without taste and made my stomach forget its compass. I held Mara\u2019s gaze like those were instructions. It felt like nothing for a series of long minutes and then like sitting down on a seat in a train that was not there. I fell through. I caught myself in another breath. I was not ready and I was completely ready.\n\nThis is where the story could become grotesque if I let it. That is not the story I am telling. There was body, yes, there were the motions of eating and swallowing and the small involuntary sounds the throat makes when it is asked to be a road. But in the actual, in the interior, it was like heat moving toward another heat and learning to negotiate skin. The Echophage takes some tissue because the body loves form, but it is more interested in the echo of the tissue than the tissue. We are not meat is a thing the polite say at dinners. It is a lie. We are meat and echo. Threnody made me a bridge like a mother making an obscene craft for the school fair. Mara chose to cross.\n\nShe closed her eyes. I watched her lashes tremble and I counted between the tremors because my nurse taught me to do that. Something in me lit. She, my sister, stepped into me without feet. When I say step, what I mean is: there was the rush of her laugh in my ears when she was four and I pulled the sheet over us like a tent. There was the smell of the lemon soap she used when she was fifteen and wanted to be gentle with her own wrists after the Council had bound them with learning cords. There was the weight of her shoulder when she fell asleep on my shoulder in a transport that was so cold our teeth clicked. There was the stupid sweater against my face when we were nineteen and I told her a secret I will never write here. There was the taste of her taste of the world, the apple peel and the copper of a penny she had put in her mouth on a dare and the bitter swallow of the medicine she hated and my old shirt she wanted because it smelled like me. There was too much. It was all light. It was all sound. It was all a scramble of arithmetic. Then there was less, then there was enough.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she said, but she did not say it out loud.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t sound like you,\u201d I said, and then I realized I didn\u2019t know what I meant by that because she sounded like herself and like me and like our mother in the good hour of the afternoon when she loved us fully.\n\n\u201cI sound like we do when we are being dangerous,\u201d she said, and laughed again. Threnody made a noise\u2014like hearing the first word of a language you invented.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll need time to settle,\u201d Threnody said aloud so the room would stay a room and not turn into a fable. \u201cYou will feel you are overlapping. You are. Don\u2019t drive heavy machinery, Mr. Indren. Don\u2019t make policy. Don\u2019t make oaths. For now you can make soup.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like running,\u201d Mara said, inside, and the muscles in my calves tightened because of it. \u201cI feel like singing. Did you know that you have a splinter on the inside of your left index finger.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do now,\u201d she said. A pause, then, softer. \u201cI don\u2019t feel dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not,\u201d I said, and my chest contracted in a way that made me think of ships going under bridges. \u201cI would never.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cI was trying to say something else but the language is busy.\u201d\n\nThe first hour was busy. We learned how to tell each other joking from warning. She learned how to twitch my fingers without scaring me into dropping a glass. I learned how to set aside space in my head for a whisper that would not be a whisper forever. We tested the Writ. Threnody, with her pretty instruments, held a borrowed micro-drone in the middle of the lab and asked it to listen. When I, alone, said halt, the drone spat static and kept its line. When I let Mara come to the front of my throat, when I allowed her to thread our voice, when I made a sound that was ours, the drone stopped with a jerk like a badly trained dog.\n\n\u201cYou have precedence,\u201d Threnody said. \u201cYou are carrying a woman\u2019s resonance inside a man\u2019s mouth. The algorithms are not moral. They are obedient.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have done this before,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cNever with a pair like you,\u201d she said, and there was pride in it like a blade.\n\nThe Palisade felt smaller. All sanctuaries grow tight when you are about to use them as a spring. The city outside had the smell it has before an electrical storm; even the glass looks like it is trying to sweat. Talitha\u2019s seven hours soured into minutes. I went to stand on the terrace and watch the east spill fold itself into glitter. A heavy breath moved across my scalp; I almost tilted my head into it like a pet. A memory of the whistling crawled up from the back stairs of the world and put its headquarters up between my eyes. I could smell steel, and older things under the steel.\n\n\u201cListening,\u201d Mara said, immediate. She was already a detective. She had always been a detective; her curiosity only needed a mandate and a name.\n\n\u201cThis is when I would have told you to go to bed,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThis is when I don\u2019t have to,\u201d she replied, and there was such joy sparkling off the syllables that I had to sit down.\n\nI had, sometimes, thought that I was brave. Because the city had not broken me in the ordinary ways. Because I had money and a house built like a cliff and a laugh for the Archon-Mother. I had not been brave. I understood that sitting there. I had been sheltered by my wealth and my rudeness and by my sister\u2019s refusal to mark me as fragile. Courage, when it came, tasted like a bowl of water you put by your own bed. Necessary, plain, easy to knock over if you flail.\n\n\u201cWhat will we do now,\u201d I asked her, as if there had been no plan beyond the nightmare we just made good.\n\n\u201cWe will eat,\u201d she said, with wickedness. I had been worried she would take my guilt and wear it like one of Threnody\u2019s sweaters. She would not. \u201cThen we will call the archivist and the sardine. Then we will put on shoes and go where the loud breathing is.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are impatient,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI am alive,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s new for me.\u201d\n\nThrenody left with a nod and a warning not to do anything she would have done, which covered most of the ethical landscape. The house reconfigured around us; the switches learned her; the lifts offered her their lowest selves; a thousand silent machine minds ticked over to a slightly different set of host privileges and did not know they had knelt. In the undercity a rumor grew a finger and tapped on the back of someone\u2019s skull: Indren has made himself a choir. The first piece of mail addressed to Ms. Indren arrived on our pane before dawn and I laughed until I coughed.\n\nWe ate soup like good children. We called Mus, my archivist who kept too many dangerous things in a little room under a safer name. He appeared on the pane like a raven under a length of silk. His hair was mad. He had painted his eyelids with something that made them look like they belonged to someone else.\n\n\u201cYou look tired,\u201d Mus said, which in his language meant you look the same as you always have. \u201cWhat exquisite crime have you asked of me now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rumor of the Breather. Where does it start. Where does it go when it\u2019s tired of wandering,\u201d I said.\n\nMus performed a small, theatrical shudder that also helped his brain. \u201cHe is not a he, they say. He is a partnership. He is an old soldier from the Theatre War. He has a cousin in the electronics in the Council Hall. He is a heretic who believes men should be allowed to speak in the morning. He is a machine that wants to be a family. And,\u201d Mus leans close then, \u201che is related to Darth Vadar.\u201d\n\n\u201cVadar,\u201d Mara said, correcting the A softly in my mind as if that mattered here. \u201cPeople always spelled it wrong when we were small.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hear her,\u201d Mus said, and then he blinked. \u201cGods, Cassian. You did it. You lunatic. You dinner plate.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeak slowly,\u201d I told him. \u201cSpeak as if we are old people leaning on a balcony.\u201d\n\nHe licked his lower lip. \u201cVadar is the old fiction, yes? Your nurse told you too many stories from the wrong era. The breathing villain with the black mask. It is a costume. It is a god. It is a father you can use to frighten children into obedience. The rumor in the lower quarter says our Breather is kin to him. That he is a descendant of one of the men who built the original mask. Or that he is an heir to the myth itself. He has a right to the breath. He has a right to take our oxygen and make us pay tax on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDebt theme,\u201d Mara said to me. \u201cHe writes PAST DUE. He collects air.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would this city let him do this,\u201d I asked, for myself. \u201cWhy would the Matrons permit a story they should crush.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it is useful,\u201d Mus said. \u201cBecause fear must be maintained as well as manufactured. Because so long as he kills the right people, the wrong people will call you for soup.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know where we will be able to listen to him,\u201d Mara asked through me. There was a difference in the question when she was at the bow of it. The difference was a lessening of apology.\n\nMus made a gentle finger-wave that meant maybe. \u201cCome to the Stoa after the third hour. The old women sell radios there that pick up the columns under the city. I know a grandmother who owes me a lie.\u201d\n\nWe shut the pane; the room held the ghost of Mus\u2019s requirement for heavier air. I stood and the world slipped sideways a fraction, then righted, then clicked into place like a spine that wanted to be good.\n\n\u201cWe should tell the Archon no,\u201d Mara said. \u201cWe should not tell her anything until after we are done.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe will take what she wants anyway,\u201d I said. \u201cBut yes. Let us do the unlawful lawful things first.\u201d\n\nI put on the coat that makes me look like a nice idea in a bad area and Mara coiled herself in my nerves and made me stand up a little more narrowly, like a woman may stand when she wants the street to treat her like a blade instead of an oven. The lifts felt like stairs because in the mind every descent is a negotiation. The Palisade slid us down to the level where the old stones show through. Threnody had told me not to drive and I drove anyway because somewhere, in some long-ago, I promised myself I would always break one rule when I was sober and trying. The car did not disagree with us. It loved us. The city, for a moment, did not.\n\nThe Stoa is a market that pretends it is ancient because it has columns. The columns are poured polymer made to look like worn stone. The women are real. Their eyes weigh you like you are fish they plan to smoke later. We stepped into their cool shade and let the crowd fold around our shoulders. We walked between stalls of wired-up junk and knitted flags and jars of snail sauces with labels written by hands that shook and did not apologize for shaking. We walked like two in one because that is what we were.\n\n\u201cThere,\u201d Mara said, bright, and turned my head to a stall draped in faded red. The grandmother behind it wore a scarf that had been blue in some century. She was the kind of grandmother who takes one look at you and names your crimes. She smiled a very small smile at me and at me. \u201cYou have brought your chorus,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes sense. You are untidy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like a radio,\u201d I said. \u201cOne that listens low.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all do,\u201d she said, unoffended. She picked up a brown plastic box with a cracked face and whispered at it. The face uncracked. \u201cThis will hear the pipes under your house. It will hear the pipes under the river. It will hear the song of the mother machines if they are half asleep. You will think it is whispering to you. It will not be. It will be whispering to itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want it to hear a man,\u201d Mara said.\n\nThe grandmother leaned closer, pin and needle in her stare. \u201cAh,\u201d she said. \u201cThe boy who pretends to be an inheritance. He is loud. But he does not speak in a place like this, so you are safe until you are not.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know him,\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI know his mother,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is always the more important information. In a city like ours.\u201d\n\nWe paid with coin because paper made these women melancholy and digital made them suspicious. She wrapped the radio in a towel that looked like it had once been used to swaddle someone who is now very famous. We carried it back to the car like a lunch.\n\n\u201cHe is related to the mask,\u201d Mara said to me, when the doors shut us into the low perfume of air-conditioning. \u201cOr he wants us to think he is. The theme again. Men pretending at fathers. Women permitting it because it makes their theater better.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you certain you want to do this,\u201d I asked, not because I had doubt but because doubt is a ritual you go through to starve regret.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said simply. \u201cAsk me again tomorrow in case our stories changed.\u201d\n\nWe drove the long way home. The city was full of ambulances and bicycles and small girls with huge knives in their belts because this is how their mothers love them. We passed a mural that was painted over itself so many times it had become a palimpsest of queens and warnings. There was a section left of a phrase that read, in silver: breathe. No one can help but do it. I thought of the Breather, of the rumor that he was kin to a mask from a film that might not be remembered by anyone who mattered now. I felt Mara feel it too. It is a strange luxury to not be the only one feeling a thing.\n\nAt the Palisade, we set the radio under the table and fed it a line from the house. It made a noise like the evening. I tuned; Mara tuned me tuning; the bands rolled past like strips of slick cloth. When I hit the right seam, it was not a voice that came through but a lull. Then a sound like an animal remembering. Then the whistle we knew.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d I said to the air, and at the same time Mara said, only in me, hello. The two made a chord. The radio hiccuped. The whistle answered. It was the old cinema sound, yes, the dramatized mechanical respiration. But under it there was something else. A rhythm from here, not from there. You cannot fake the pace of a city.\n\nHe spoke, not to us, not to anyone in particular, the way a man might read his notes aloud on a bus and think that makes him invisible. \u201cRecurrence,\u201d he murmured. \u201cPayment. Honor. Patriarchy is a breath held in a box. Open the box, lose the breath. Keep the box closed, suffocate. These are your choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoet,\u201d Mara scoffed. \u201cExhale, show-off.\u201d\n\nI did not laugh. That is the thing: there is a kind of horror that you recognize as kindred if you have ever loved the sound of your own theories. I felt a shiver go through me; it was not hers and not entirely mine.\n\n\u201cWe will find him,\u201d Mara said, fierce. \u201cWe will stop him. We will give the Council nothing of ours but our contempt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we\u2019d better get comfortable with how low we have to go,\u201d I murmured. The radio made a sound like a heart deciding.\n\nNight came on like a glance under a door. Talitha called twice. I let the pane darken and the calls fall into the quiet drawer. The house watched us. The city set its jaws for another round of nonsense and law. We had done the worst thing and nothing had improved and the world had shifted its balance anyway.\n\n\u201cSleep,\u201d I told her, because the body always wants the old commands.\n\n\u201cWe will be awake together,\u201d she said, and for a while we were. We made plans with too much detail and then no detail at all. We argued about shoes. We practiced having her lift my left hand and point with my right. When I finally lowered my eyes and let their sand creep in, she hummed in my head the rhythm of the siren my nurse loved and I counted mostly wrong, mostly on purpose.",
