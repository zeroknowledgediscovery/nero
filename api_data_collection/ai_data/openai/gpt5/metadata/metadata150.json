     "novel_text": "At dusk the city\u2019s teeth came out. Copper roofs and black spires, banners hissing like serpents in the wind. Eydolon balanced between its two Declares\u2014the Treaty of Red and the Charter of Sound\u2014while the Night Lancers massed in their marble barracks like patient thunder. People pretended not to notice the vampires striding down the lantern avenues with shields like broken moons. People pretended a lot of things after the Ash Wars. That was how you lived here. Pretend, then nod, then watch. Some of us sang. Or we tried.\n\nMara Ives stood in the queue outside the Glass District\u2019s third-most-important recording house, Hollow Sun, and tried not to scratch at the faded itch on her left hand. The sigil there had never quite gone away, a ghost of warmth beneath her knuckles, as if ink that wasn\u2019t ink had sunk down into the veins. It had showed up when she was seven and had been, at the time, a crescent the colour of tea. Now it was a whisper. She curved her fingers to hide it and felt silly for caring.\n\n\u201cYou going in or not?\u201d said the girl behind her, eyeliner like a storm.\n\nMara shuffled forward. The line jerked, a chorus of nervous laughter rose and fell, someone dropped a bottle cap and it rolled forever. Above them, a billboard flashed: ANTHEMS FOR A NEW EYDOLON. A fang-white smile, a male soloist with hair like lacquer. The tag line: We Don\u2019t Do Ballads, We Do Blood.\n\n\u201cFirst time?\u201d the eyeliner girl asked.\n\n\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Mara lied, even though everything about her was first time. First time in the Glass District at night without her mother. First time in a queue where the front of the room was a panel of A&Rs linked to Night Lancer rotations. First time wearing boots her father would have called impractical for running.\n\nThe girl gave her a once-over. \u201cCute jacket. You look like you don\u2019t want to be here. Always a help.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to be here,\u201d Mara said, and swallowed. Her throat was dry. \u201cI just\u2014my mother says if I get chosen I\u2019ll need to sleep during the day and she can\u2019t stand people sleeping during the day. The light offends her.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes your mother eat soup with a fork too?\u201d said the girl, and then grinned before turning away to scroll a mirror into existence with her thumb. A privacy charm shimmered, then faded.\n\nMara\u2019s phone vibrated. A message from her mother shot to the top of the screen: back by third bell. no deals with men in coats. if they offer food don\u2019t take it unless you watch them cook it. call me if your feet hurt i\u2019ll tell you to sit down. love.\n\nShe typed, i am not five. also my feet are fine. also love.\n\nHer mother\u2019s typing bubble appeared immediately. you\u2019re never not five.\n\nThe queue twitched again and the heavy glass doors breathed. Inside: a cruise ship of a lobby, crisscrossed by gold escalators and humming with the kind of music that eats its own tail. Mara clutched her zippered portfolio, which held a handful of song scraps written in cramped pencil: sticky pop hooks that came to her like embroidery, and two ballads she would never show these people in a million years because they were about grief and aftertaste and the sound of the cellar when the wind was under it. Grief didn\u2019t sell. Eydolon only wanted songs they could chant in unison in the combat tunnels, layered atop the march-steps of the Night Lancers.\n\nShe had come because a friend\u2014okay, the eyeliner girl\u2019s cousin\u2014had said the A&R director himself, Pax Lumen, could grant an audience with the Lancer Lord. She had come because the Charter of Sound had returned to public fashion, and the city wanted a saint with a pop chorus.\n\nAnd she had come because the ring had sung to her in the kitchen two nights ago, and she had spent forty minutes pretending it was the faucet squealing, and then an hour not breathing at all.\n\nThat ring lay in her pocket, wrapped in a napkin, wrapped in superstition. It was the wrong colour for silver, the wrong weight for glass. Her mother had called it a tourist trinket when it arrived in the post, no sender, no note. Mara had snorted and put it in a drawer. Then the crows knew her name, and every time she walked under the viaduct the pigeons paused.\n\nThe line burbled forward. The guard at the door took her name like a thief. Inside, the chill of money. The lobby wall shimmered with a slow loop of Night Lancers training in the rain, gear spinning, swords collapsing into baton-like rods. A tagline scrolled beneath: WE WERE MONSTERS. NOW WE\u2019RE YOURS.\n\nA man folded himself from a couch nearby, lifting a scarf. He looked like a story about youth written by someone who\u2019d never been young. A scar chiseled his cheekbone.\n\n\u201cPax Lumen,\u201d said the eyeliner girl under her breath, as if spitting out a fruit seed. \u201cCareful\u2014he with the bright teeth.\u201d\n\nPax scanned the room like a lighthouse. He always knew when someone was pretending. His gaze snagged on Mara and held, like a thumb on a string.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d he said. \u201cMara Ives?\u201d\n\nShe nodded. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\nHe winced. \u201cDon\u2019t do that to me. I\u2019m not the one with gloves. Come upstairs. I\u2019ve got ten minutes before the Command Council calls me for another lecture on tone.\u201d\n\nShe could feel every eye in the lobby snap to her back as she followed. There were whispers, the word ring, she thought she heard. Or she thought she hoped someone had finally said it out loud so it wasn\u2019t just hers to carry, a foolish thing and a dangerous thing both. Pax moved like a man who never worried about what his back looked like to anybody.\n\nHe took her through a hallway of dark wood and colder music, past doors that breathed sound, past a wall of framed gold discs and silver helmets. He opened a door at the end with a palm and ushered her into a chamber that felt like a deep-bellied instrument. A low table. A couch that tried to be seductive. Floor-to-ceiling windows showing the war barracks across the river, their steady lights.\n\n\u201cYou know why I pulled you,\u201d Pax said, and didn\u2019t make it a question.\n\nMara shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re honest. That makes this briefly easier.\u201d Pax leaned his elbows on his knees. He had a dimple and the tired eyes of a man who has held too many funerals. \u201cTell me about the song in your kitchen.\u201d\n\nMara closed her eyes because embarrassment was easier to manage in the dark. She folded her hands together, thumb over thumb, as if praying. \u201cThere was a\u2026tone. Not a melody, not at first. A hum, only it wasn\u2019t coming from anywhere. It was\u2026being wavelengths, you know? It\u2019s not a good explanation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect explanation,\u201d Pax said, and his voice was a little softer. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told myself it was a pipe. And then\u2014\u201d She groped for the right stupidity. \u201cI put on water to boil. I touched the ring. Just to, I don\u2019t know. Test it and get it over with. It burned. But not like burning. Like cold. Like I could see my hands light up without them really doing it.\u201d Mara opened her eyes. \u201cDo you think\u2014my mother says there are devices for that. Prank rings.\u201d\n\nPax laughed, and it was like an engine misfiring. \u201cSure, and sometimes the moon is a paper lantern hung by a kindly God so the children won\u2019t be scared. Do you have it?\u201d\n\nMara hesitated. \u201cWhat happens if I do?\u201d\n\nPax shrugged. \u201cThen I perhaps offer you a job. And someone else in a different building has an easier time sleeping because they know the Charter is not a relic. And eventually, if you consent, the vampires swing their batons just a little cleaner because the city\u2019s song is a live wire again instead of a museum piece.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy consent?\u201d she said, too sharp.\n\nHis smile flicked. \u201cThat part is real. There are, however, civic urgencies. The Lancers can\u2019t compel a cantor. Not anymore. The wars ruined that sort of convenience in us. But the ring\u2014and I suspect you know this even if you don\u2019t know how you know\u2014likes to be used. It doesn\u2019t enjoy drawers.\u201d\n\nSlowly, as if she were negotiating with a wild animal, Mara pulled the napkin bundle from her pocket and set it on the table. Pax didn\u2019t reach for it. He waited. The napkin\u2019s threads trembled under her fingers. She unwound it. The ring lay like a small planet on the cloth: pale metal with flecks of something like ash beneath its translucent surface, a lens with a darkness at the center, as if it had been made to see through time to water and ruin.\n\nPax\u2019s mouth pressed thin. \u201cI thought it would be ugly,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone always says it was the most beautiful thing they\u2019ve ever held, because that\u2019s the only way they can justify what it asks. But I think\u2014I think honesty might be the new glamour.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not mine,\u201d Mara said quickly. \u201cIt just arrived. No one told me. I only, I haven\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\nHe held up a hand. \u201cThe ring is nobody\u2019s. It chooses a throat and a heart. The old stories say it was forged in the last days of the Quietites by a woman who promised that sound could shape a city if it were honest and ungentle enough. The Night Lancers of Oris have always listened for it. But the ring goes where it goes. It found you. It passed through hands to find you. That isn\u2019t theft. It\u2019s how fate misbehaves.\u201d\n\nFate misbehaves, she thought, and then\u2014\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask my age.\u201d\n\nPax blinked. \u201cI read your file. You turned twenty last winter. Your mother made a pistachio-cheery cake; I am jealous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean\u2014\u201d She flushed. It was ridiculous. \u201cThere are rumours. That the ring requires\u2026purity.\u201d\n\nHe looked at her as if she were telling him he was a fish. \u201cIgnorance is purity,\u201d he said. \u201cNot stupid, mind you. Untethered. Uncontext. The ring needs a throat that hasn\u2019t been taught to steady itself for convenience. People think virginal means flesh. It\u2019s not that. It\u2019s an unused vow. It\u2019s a person who hasn\u2019t yet promised away their voice. You\u2019ve never signed a contract, not even at the open mic level. You\u2019ve never bent yourself to suit a room, I can hear it when you speak. There are edges. The ring likes edges.\u201d\n\nMara exhaled and felt a little dizzy. \u201cSo it\u2019s not\u2014that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot that,\u201d he said, his tone rueful. \u201cThough I cannot stop a city from making up stories to entertain itself.\u201d\n\nHe slid the ring closer to her with one knuckle. She didn\u2019t pick it up. She wasn\u2019t sure whether she wanted to leave the room or throw the windows open and scream. The weight in the air was heavy with potential and the memory of rain.\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d Pax said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do this carefully. There will be contracts but they will not own you. The Lancers will take your measure but they will not taste you. The city will press itself against your face but you may say no. The Charter of Sound is clear, despite what the old men on the Council think. You release one song. Just one. A pop song. It\u2019s a rite, it\u2019s a\u2014call it a broadcast. It resonates through the wards. We need it to wake the Gates. And after that you decide if you\u2019re a singer or if you\u2019re just a particular miracle, once.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow much time do I have?\u201d Her voice trembled. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014my mother will make onion soup. She\u2019ll expect me at the table.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen to you,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThe sound of a city that has not yet got hold of you. Time\u2014we have none. Or we have hours. There is a reconnaissance report at dusk. The Ash Sovereign is stirring again. The Lancers will march before dawn if they must. Your song could tilt the night. No pressure. Tea after. Onion soup before morning if you insist.\u201d\n\nHe sat back and the room exhaled with him. Mara looked at the ring and saw\u2014not a future, no, but a hundred half-futures. All of them had music in them, and in some of them she was free at the end. In others she wasn\u2019t. Her stomach did something unwise.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. Then, again, like an oath. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nIn Marrowgate Prison, in a cell that had seen five names burn into the door and fade, a man wrote a sentence, crossed it out, and wrote it again. The sentence was about a woman who had never been born. He called her by names that tasted like the river in winter. He was a killer if you asked the city and also if you asked the ledger. There was very little to argue about. His name was Silas Brune and he had made a choice twelve years ago that made the world narrower. There had been a boy and a corridor and a blade that fit a hand that seemed too ready. The story in the papers had been efficient. The story in his head never shut up.\n\nSilas wrote: In another life I make masks instead of knives. In another life the city of Eydolon is all round windows and red clay and you can plant lavender on the roofs. In another life there are no Night Lancers because there is no night.\n\nHe stopped and laughed, and the laugh wasn\u2019t a nice thing. It shook out of him like a cough. The guard on the far end of the tier glanced up and then down again. Silas dipped his pen. The prison library had given him four sheets of real paper for the week, which was a kindness they told him he was wasting. He wasted them anyway. He thought about the girl he had seen once at the edge of a crowd when they brought the vampires back from the southern gates with broken shields: she had a look that made your hunger stop. Not pity. Not worship. He thought maybe if he wrote her, the alternative would write itself, and in that other city he did not make a corridor dim with the end of someone.\n\nHe wrote: In this alternative, there is a ring made of a window that was shattered without sound. It makes songs. You think you cannot imagine that? I cannot imagine much else anymore.\n\nThe paper received it, sallow and patient. He held the pen poised. He liked to think he could make a different world if he wrote fast enough. He liked to think he had been in jail all along, even before the cell. Inside the sentence. Inside the knife. Writing the story of a life he didn\u2019t get to live. A man must build a room and live in it when the city refuses one.\n\nHe closed his eyes and saw a kitchen. He didn\u2019t know why. He saw a young woman with a beautiful ignorance and a napkin she wouldn\u2019t unwrap at first. He wrote her singing, though he had never heard her voice.\n\nThe Night Lancers rode past Hollow Sun at dusk as Mara stood in front of the studio microphone and tried not to vomit. The glass room was a cathedral. The boards under her boots had been polished by the fear of a hundred voices. Pax Lumen stood in the booth with two techs, an old witch of a sound engineer named Roe, and a vampire with eyes like a paper cut.\n\nThe vampire wore his crest over a simple black shirt: a narrow shield with an iron tree. He looked like a man who lost his temper and then wrote apology notes in calligraphy. He said his name was Caelan Varro, in a voice like metal singing.\n\n\u201cThe Lord of the Night Lancers,\u201d Pax had said when they shook hands, as if she\u2019d wandered into a fable with the wrong shoes on.\n\nCaelan Varro did not overstare her. He had the discipline of a man who believed that restraint could hold a city together. He waited. He did not smile because smiling at a girl when you are a vampire carries a thousand wrong meanings and he wasn\u2019t interested in any of them.\n\n\u201cDo you hum?\u201d Roe asked. \u201cBefore you sing? Some singers do, some don\u2019t. Some pray.\u201d\n\n\u201cI count,\u201d Mara said. \u201cBut quietly.\u201d\n\n\u201cCount then,\u201d Roe said, turning a dial. \u201cCount us a road to walk you down.\u201d\n\nMara counted, lips parted but no sound at first. She counted the way she had as a child, when a storm broke the sky and she had to pretend that numbers were stones, reliable and breathable. She counted to seven, because seven was where you could stop if you had to and say you were only tuning and not failing.\n\nPax pressed the talk-back button. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready. Remember, it doesn\u2019t have to be good. It has to be true. Pop is just truth with a beat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the same thing,\u201d Roe said grumpily, and turned another dial.\n\nMara looked at the ring on her finger for the first time as something owned. It didn\u2019t fit so much as adapt, subtly adjusting in minuscule sighs. She swallowed. She lifted her hands because something in her wanted to summon or push away or both. She wanted her mother, who would stand next to her and put a palm on her back and say, This is going to hurt but it\u2019s going to be ours.\n\nAcross the glass, Caelan Varro watched her with a tactical attention that should have been terrifying and wasn\u2019t. There was something in it that recognized her, as if he had been waiting at different doors his whole long life and here was the one with someone behind it.\n\nShe sang a single note first, and it broke.\n\nShe laughed, and the laugh sounded like chalk down a slate. It startled her. She tried again. The second note found a place to sit.\n\n\u201cAgain,\u201d Pax said gently.\n\nShe let the ring warm. She thought of the kitchen and the faucet yelling. She thought of the pigeons listening. She thought of the city\u2019s teeth. She thought of what it meant to not promise yourself away yet. She opened her mouth and a melody came that wasn\u2019t careful. It jittered, it hopped, it refused to be elegant. But the words fell into it like stones into a steady river, splashing, making rings.\n\n\u201cI am a wire,\u201d she sang, and the line surprised her. \u201cI am a voice on fire. You don\u2019t know my name yet, but you will by the morning light\u2014\u201d\n\nHer boots found the beat because Roe found it first and laid it down under her, a thump like a door opening. Pax held up a hand and the tech muttered \u201cLive,\u201d and the red light went on that meant the city could be invited if you wanted. We do this as a private rite first, Pax had said, and if it holds, we send it through the Gate towers, we feed it to the rails. The ring would decide too. That was the part that was both fair and not.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a blade not drawn yet, I\u2019m a vow you haven\u2019t heard,\u201d said the next line, and she wanted to argue with herself about being melodramatic but the melody knocked all argument down. \u201cI won\u2019t be quiet, no, I won\u2019t be\u2014quiet you\u2014quiet you\u2014\u201d\n\nThe ring threw sparks on the inside of her knuckles. It showed her the city\u2019s map flipped inside out. It showed her the river walking. The air in the studio thickened with math.\n\nIn the booth, Roe swore in a useful way and pulled two channels down. Pax was grinning now, not in triumph but in relief so honest it stung to see. Caelan Varro inclined his head, and the small movement had the weight of a vow.\n\n\u201cKeep it dirty,\u201d Roe said into the talk-back. \u201cDon\u2019t polish. Pop hates clean. Pop wants the thing that almost fell out of your mouth.\u201d\n\nMara nodded, a small soundless yes. She did not think the words. She let the drum do the thinking. She let herself say it like a dare to every corridor she had ever walked without looking up.\n\n\u201cI am the ring and I am the finger,\u201d she sang, and Pax twitched because he had wanted to skip that, ancient and on the nose and maybe wrong. But the ring wanted it and she wanted it and the two of them together were not interested in a marketing plan.\n\n\u201cIf you touch me you\u2019ll remember,\u201d she sang, and then it went sideways into light. The chord she chose should not have fit. It slid off the beat like a glass on a wet table. And then it found a groove that had been waiting under the city for years, the one that made people breathe on the offbeat. It was a pop song, glitzy and shameless, and the power in it didn\u2019t come from shame or red hunger. It came from the audacity of saying: we are here, we are ridiculous and venomous and brave, we are going to dance while we strap on armor.\n\nPax hit the button that said Send. It was small and he had sworn he would wait. But the room felt bigger now than a room. The walls were more perforation than wall. The city wanted the song as much as the song wanted the city. He pressed and the lightning went forth.\n\nIn Marrowgate, Silas Brune heard the hum through stone. It tickled his ear and made his pen skip. He sat up, slow, like a dog in a new house. He had heard a thousand sounds in that prison, water dividing itself, the whisper of a rat designing a universe, the long rope of scar tissue that was a man\u2019s snore. He had never heard this. It was like someone plucked a thread that ran through him twenty miles away.\n\nHe wrote: In another life, I do not kill him. In another life, I hear this song earlier.\n\nHe went to the bars and pressed his forehead to the cold. The guard looked up and then looked away. There was the tiniest smile trying its foolish luck at the corner of Silas\u2019s mouth. He let it. He wasn\u2019t sure whether it was his.\n\nIn Eydolon, the Gate towers drank the song. Music bloomed along the rails, ran down into the tunnels, bounced off the shields at the training grounds, slipped into the pockets of civilians like a charm slipped into a hand. People stopped mid-step. In the bakery on Bridge Street, a woman with flour on her knuckles put down the proofing basket and laughed. In the barracks, soldiers looked at each other with the stranded expression of someone remembering how to be happy and not liking the suddenness of it. The Ash flicker along the far walls of the city guttered and steadied. Above the floodgates, the old runes breathed.\n\nCaelan closed his eyes and let the song pass through him. He was old enough to remember the last time a Charter Song had been done properly, before the Councils fractured and the Church lost its mirror. That had been a boy\u2019s voice, as sharp as new gin. This one was a woman\u2019s voice. It got itself dirty. It made a promise it might regret. He liked that. Cities needed regret as much as they needed teeth.\n\nHe opened his eyes and saw Pax looking at him, and something like a conversation passed between them without a word. There would be trouble. There were always rumours when a man like Pax pressed the red button earlier than the men with medals liked. There would be the matter of consent, of the Charter\u2019s clauses. There would be the old wives with their old complaints and the new wolves with their new strategies. There would be, above all, the Ash Sovereign\u2019s answer.\n\nMara sang a last line that wasn\u2019t part of the plan, because there had never been a plan except the ring\u2019s and hers, and then she stopped because it was correct to stop. The final syllable hung like a drop of resin, then hardened.\n\nSilence in the studio was elegant. It did not apologize for itself.\n\nMara took the ring off and put it on the table. Her hands were trembling. She had sweat through the cute jacket. She had never felt more tired or more proud or more terrified.\n\nPax exhaled so gently you could have mistaken it for man trying not to cry. He clicked the button and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be gentle now, and then later I\u2019ll go be un-gentle to the men with chairs. You did it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did a song,\u201d Mara said, dazed. She did not quite yet feel the city hearing her. She felt doorways. She felt the electric after of a kiss she hadn\u2019t had.\n\nRoe came out and hugged her awkwardly from one side. Caelan did not move, which was his hug. Pax did what he always did when he loved someone a little: he arranged a bottle of water three inches closer.\n\n\u201cYou need a statement,\u201d Pax said. \u201cThey will ask why a Charter Song is also a pop song and you will tell them the Charter never said a song had to wear a robe.\u201d\n\nMara laughed, burned out and high. \u201cDo I get to go home after this?\u201d\n\nPax\u2019s smile folded. \u201cYes. For tonight. A car will take you. And a guard.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need\u2014\u201d She stopped when Caelan raised an eyebrow.\n\n\u201cYou did a thing that changes the light in the city,\u201d Caelan said. \u201cYou will take a guard so that fools feel deterred from using the dark to rearrange you.\u201d\n\n\u201cRearrange me,\u201d she repeated, and almost grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s polite.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are very polite when we are about to scare people,\u201d Caelan said, and the corners of his mouth did a peculiar, almost human thing. \u201cI will walk you to the car.\u201d\n\nThe elevator ride down was an elongated breath. Mara looked at the neon of the Glass District smeared on the doors. Her phone was vibrating again. She thought of her mother\u2019s onion soup and almost wept. She thought of Silas Brune and didn\u2019t know why she thought of him, a name that was a news story, a monster behind a headline, a man who lived at the fringe of every cautionary tale in Eydolon. The ring had showed her a corridor for a moment while she sang. It had been darker than any hallway she\u2019d ever been in. There had been a feeling of someone unsaying his life.\n\n\u201cWill it hurt?\u201d she asked without meaning to ask it out loud.\n\nCaelan tilted his head. \u201cWill what?\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing this. Doing that again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, not unkind. \u201cBut that is\u2014life. And the ring does not like liars.\u201d\n\nShe felt stupid tears gather. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be\u2014owned by it. Or by anyone. I don\u2019t want to end up one of those, you know, cautionary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you must be very busy being otherwise,\u201d Caelan said. \u201cThere is not much else to do about being a cautionary tale except refuse to end when the story says you ought to.\u201d\n\nThe elevator opened into the lobby and the world rushed at them. The song had been out for nine minutes and the Glass District was a tongue. People were filming. People were crying. People pretended again and then failed at pretending. Mara felt invisible and too visible simultaneously. A child with red hair stared at her with a concentration that pinned butterflies to boards.\n\nShe almost asked Pax to hold her hand. He would have. But she did not. She walked shoulder to shoulder with a vampire lord instead and it made her feel ridiculous, and strong, and like a rumor in her own bones.\n\nIn Marrowgate, Silas put his hand against the concrete and whispered, \u201cIn another life I hold a thread that is not a throat.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou talking to the wall, Brune?\u201d the guard said, bored more than unkind.\n\n\u201cWriting,\u201d Silas said, and the guard laughed exactly once and then looked like he regretted it.\n\nHe lay down with his arm over his face and tried to dream an alternative where the song had come before the boy in the corridor. He didn\u2019t get there. He got instead a window he couldn\u2019t see out of and the sense of someone speaking on the other side, very close.\n\nAt home in a small apartment that smelled like thyme and laundry, Edda Ives set out two bowls and stirred a pot with a spoon that had belonged to her mother. She had the news on. She had a panicked cat pretending to be indifferent under the table. She felt the song when it passed down the wall. She stopped stirring and put her hand to her chest and said, \u201cOh.\u201d\n\nHer daughter was a woman, yes, and also\u2014still a ridiculous child who had once tried to teach the kettle to purr. Edda hoped the city deserved her for one night. It often did not deserve anything for longer than that.\n\nMara sat in the back of the car and counted again. Seven. She looked at the ring on the seat beside her where she had set it, as if it were a passenger prone to carsickness. Caelan sat across from her like a story told to furniture. Pax was on the phone in the front seat saying, \u201cYes, but listen, it worked. Yes, I know the Charter. I can read. No, I will not tell her to wear white.\u201d\n\nThere was a siren slice somewhere and then quiet again. Eydolon wore the song now like a wet dress, clinging and cold, revealing. Mara wondered if she would be recognized at the market, buying cucumbers, next week. She wondered if any of this would be a market next week.\n\nShe had wanted to be smaller than this. She had wanted to make songs that were silly and made girls put glitter on their cheeks in bathrooms. She had wanted to be the person who knew all the songs but not the person who wrote the ones that moved rivers. She had wanted the ring to be a prank. And yet now that it wasn\u2019t, something inside her uncrossed its arms and said, Fine. Let\u2019s find out who I am if I can\u2019t wriggle out of this.\n\n\u201cDo the Night Lancers like pop?\u201d she said, just to see Caelan\u2019s face.\n\nHe met her joke with a straight answer. \u201cThey like whatever carries them through the nonnegotiable darkness between here and where they must be. Some of them pretend not to. Some of them write letters to the songs they pretend not to like.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you like?\u201d She knew she should stop. She wasn\u2019t going to stop.\n\n\u201cDrums,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd unembarrassed singing. And the silence after a victory that was not expected. And onion soup.\u201d\n\nMara blinked. \u201cI\u2019m starting to like you, and I think that\u2019s a mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are untrustworthy. But we are honest about it, which confuses people.\u201d\n\nThe car turned left where it should have turned right and the driver apologized without being told to. Pax was off the phone now and looking at two devices at once, his hands making the kind of motion that calms tech and inflames men who want to be calm. The city outside the window was its own armour: bridges like rib bones, corners like elbows, the river carrying on.\n\n\u201cYour mother will hate me,\u201d Pax said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll bring you soup,\u201d Mara said. \u201cIt will change your life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a life,\u201d Pax said, which may have been a joke.\n\nShe watched the night. She watched her future walk next to the car like a stranger who kept pace uninvited. She closed her eyes and saw the song. She opened them and saw a woman on a balcony with her hands over her mouth. She saw a group of kids hanging out of a window with their phones held up, the screen glow like secret fires. She saw a man on a step who had chosen not to go inside just yet in case the song asked him to.\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Pax said, \u201cwe do the part where we argue that the Charter is not a museum display. And you do the part where you breathe and try to sleep. And I go to the Tower and tell the Lord Governor that if he uses the word maiden I will bite him.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease do,\u201d Mara said, tired and evil.\n\nThe car pulled up to her building, old brick like bread crust. Caelan stepped out first and looked at the roofline as if roofs told him stories. To her right, a shadow moved in the alley and then decided not to be a problem. The ring sat on the seat between them like an answer nobody had asked yet.\n\n\u201cKeep it,\u201d Caelan said when he saw her look. \u201cDon\u2019t leave it on tables. Rings are famous for getting bored and leaving when you make them wait.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to\u2014I was.\u201d\n\nHe picked the ring up with two fingers. It glinted and his lip curled the tiniest degree, like something that had a taste he didn\u2019t expect. He handed it to her. The metal was warm. It took her back like a cat that wasn\u2019t angry enough to stay gone.\n\n\u201cThank you for the guard deterring fools,\u201d she said, with more sincerity than she had expected to have.\n\nHe bowed, an old-world thing that should have looked ridiculous and didn\u2019t. \u201cWe are very good at frightening fools. It is our most civic denomination.\u201d\n\nThen he left because a vampire lord should not be in your stairwell when you are about to hug your mother. Pax squeezed her shoulder like the man he wasn\u2019t allowed to be in public and said, \u201cSleep, little miracle. The city will still be rude in the morning.\u201d\n\nMara went upstairs. She knocked the three knocks that said I\u2019m not a stranger and I\u2019m not the landlord. Her mother opened the door and then there was soup and a cat and a chair and a short silence like a blanket. Her phone was still vibrating on the table. She put it face down. The world could be loud outside. Inside, there was onion and bread and the two of them not pretending for a minute that any of this was normal.\n\n\u201cMy girl,\u201d Edda said, and used a word that was completely denuded of childishness.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know if I could,\u201d Mara said, and didn\u2019t specify.\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d Edda said, as if that solved anything and maybe it did. She put her hand on Mara\u2019s forehead and then, like a woman casting a spell she had no training for, tapped the ring once with her knuckle. The ring made the tiniest noise, heard only by two women and a cat.\n\nLater, when the building slept and the city wore stranger faces, Mara stood at her window and looked at the river. She touched the pane. She imagined she could see where the magic ran, like veins in a wrist. She thought of a man in a prison writing an alternative life that included her. She thought of vampires as warriors who would be at the bridge at dawn, bearing people\u2019s songs like armour. She thought of promises and of refusing to be rearranged. She thought of being a particular miracle, once.\n\nShe hummed, hardly more than breath. The ring didn\u2019t answer. It had done enough for one day. It lay against her skin and behaved like a piece of jewelry.\n\nAt Marrowgate, Silas dreamed of balconies and laughter and a river unbraiding itself. He woke to the thin light of almost morning and the sound of his own voice saying into the stale air, \u201cIn another life, I choose not to choose the knife.\u201d\n\nFor once, the room was kind enough not to echo him. Outside, the Night Lancers lined up in disciplined geometry. Caelan Varro looked down the rank of his warriors and thought, Our city has a voice again. He did not know yet what price it would be. He only knew that the song had threaded their nights together with a string that would make it harder for them to forget one another in the dark.\n\nIn a world where the vampires were the ones you prayed for when the shadows moved, a girl who had not yet promised away her throat had released a pop song using a magic ring, and the city pretended and then stopped pretending and then danced in place. Somewhere a killer wrote a better life. Somewhere, someone waited for dawn as if dawn were a person they might love. The river carried on. The Gates breathed. The soup cooled. The song replayed whether you wanted it to or not. And above the Glass District, the billboards tried to catch up with what had already happened and failed, slowly, with such human precision it almost made them endearing.Morning in Eydolon wore its halo crooked and pretended not to be tired. The river made the sort of noise a person makes when they find out they have to go to work again. Smoke from the bread ovens came up slow and silver, and every cornice wore a little dew like sweat. The city\u2019s billboards were late to the party; they still showed hot faces from last night\u2019s releases, a boy with lacquer hair and a fang-white smile, a drink brand pretending to be a revolution. Between them, the Gate towers did their own kind of advertising: a faint pulse along the old Quietite runes, a beating that made pigeons rotate on their ledges and steeple spiders move their webs three inches left like they knew something about geometry and fate.\n\nCaelan Varro stood at the edge of the east drill field and watched his Lancers go through the first forms. Their boots struck in time to a rhythm the city had given them, and he did not correct that. He let his officers make the small noises that made the discipline hold, that kept men attached to their bodies when they wanted to drift into song and leave their edges behind. He had slept an hour and a half in a chair with a square back that tried to reduce him; it didn\u2019t, and after he woke he felt a little like he had been sanded and then polished with river grit.\n\nHe listened to the reports from the night face him out of other men\u2019s mouths. There had been a disturbance by the Third Gate, a scuffing like a door trying to decide whether to be polite. There had been a gathering in the Glass District that started as happiness and threatened for a twitching moment to become a riot, because joy made people brave as often as it made them fools. One of the western rails had vibrated hard enough that a man on the platform had dropped his coffee and swore an oath to the sort of god who accepted oaths about coffee. The north riverlight flickered once without wind. And someone had nailed a copy of the Charter of Sound to the door of a flower shop with bright pins, as if to say, Remember, this is not yours alone.\n\nHis adjutant, a woman whose hair had gone white on the forward edge first and who wore it cropped to make the most of the white, handed him two pages of paper that had been pressed flat with palm and ring. He took them because he dealt in paper almost as often as he dealt in war, and he read them while his Lancers finished the sequence that put their bodies into the shape of a promise.\n\nThe first paper was a schedule he had no chance of honoring. The second was a summary of the Lord Governor\u2019s feelings about last night in language carefully shaved of profanity. The Lord Governor wanted the word maiden used in three separate statements and had been advised by three separate staffers not to. Caelan laughed to himself, and the laugh was like a small stone skipped across his ribs. He folded the papers, put them into the pocket beneath his crest, and made a mental note to send Pax a message that would begin with a courteous insult and end with a compliment Pax would pretend he was not hungry for.\n\n\u201cLord Varro,\u201d said his quartermaster, appearing the way good quartermasters did, like a necessary thought. \u201cThere\u2019s ash dust on the south parapet. Not blow-in. More like shed.\u201d\n\nCaelan\u2019s mouth made the shape his officers called the hinge, which meant a door in him swung, careful and clean. \u201cShow me,\u201d he said, and walked with her along the edge of the field where the stone wall rose chest-high and held back the long drop to the river flats. The ash dust wasn\u2019t much, a pinch here and there, a smudge like extinguished charcoal where it didn\u2019t belong. It made a small shape if you wanted to see a shape. He wanted to. It looked like fingertips. It looked like someone had held their hands above the parapet and shaken them clean.\n\n\u201cThe Sovereign\u2019s flies?\u201d the quartermaster said. \u201cOr some boy with a pack and a grudge.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet us pretend to be optimistic before we get to be correct,\u201d he said, and sent for a warder who could read ash the way Roe read sound curves. His Lancers beat their boots five more times and then stopped together. The field hung in the pause as if the world would applaud them and then remembered it wasn\u2019t a theater, it was a training ground for a war you had to be inventive enough to survive without becoming the reason it had to be fought again in twenty years.\n\nCaelan dismissed them with a hand and stood a moment longer with the south light on his face. The song was still faint in him. He could find it if he wanted, the way a scar can be found with a fingertip in the dark. He let it go. He would call for it later when he needed men to march across a bridge toward things that were not supposed to exist and did. He had, however, other logistics to wage before noon, including a Council session that would require the strategic placement of patience like caltrops on a road.\n\nIn an apartment in the Old Weavers, where the stairwell smelled like everyone\u2019s lunch and someone\u2019s laundry and you lived your way into other people\u2019s business whether you wanted to or not, Mara Ives woke to the sound of her mother drying the bottoms of bowls with a dishcloth as if bowls scratching the table were a form of original sin. The cat was on her stomach, a weight that suggested loyalty and a refusal to move until bribed. She had slept in the blue-threaded light that belonged to people who had done something too big the day before. Her mouth tasted like the inside of a battery mixed with onion soup and an apology.\n\nShe did not open her eyes immediately. She kept them closed and called the ring slowly into her awareness the way you call a nervous creature out from under a table. It came when it wanted to. It sat, dumb as metal. She exhaled and couldn\u2019t decide if that made her glad or frightened. She did not want to be someone who felt abandoned when magic took a nap.\n\nEdda knocked on her door and did not wait for agreement because sometimes the trick of mothering was not asking, it was knowing. \u201cThere is tea and there is a man on the screen saying you are the death of culture, so things are moving along at a normal rate,\u201d Edda said, and kept her voice as ordinary as broccoli, because panic would only make this worse.\n\nMara opened her eyes to the slow calculus of morning. She sat up and slid the ring off where she had slept with it palmed in case it decided to go wandering. She put it on the windowsill and it made a small noise that may have been glass making space for metal. Her body felt heavier than she was used to being. There was a bruise blooming on her left forearm she did not remember earning, and it looked like a fingerprint left by a thing too cold to be a person.\n\nIn the small kitchen, the morning news had been bullied into public service. The woman reading it wore a mouth line like she had once operated a ferry in a storm. The words under her were a collection of the city\u2019s favorite arguments: pop or sacred, Charter or stunt, harm or help, maiden or not your business. There was a small box with a priest in it, and another small box with a historian who had published a book about the Quietites and was good at behaving like he was born in the wrong century and that was the city\u2019s fault. There were calls queued from men with chain-store shirts and women from the laundry cooperatives who had noticed their machines sing back to them a note lower this morning.\n\nEdda poured her tea with the attention of a surgeon. \u201cPax sent a message at six like he was afraid he would get in trouble if he didn\u2019t tell me where my daughter was. A car will pick you up at ten. He says wear what makes you feel least compromised. He did not explain how you are meant to know what that is.\u201d\n\nMara leaned against the counter with her cup and felt like she had smuggled something back from a country she had been told did not exist. \u201cYou should have been at the studio,\u201d she said, immediate guilt rising like a habit. \u201cI should have asked them to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should have sung the song and come home. Which you did,\u201d Edda said, and tapped the ring with an index finger the way you touch the fur of an animal you suspect might be venomous and also knows it\u2019s very pretty. \u201cI watched you on the replay while you were asleep. The end made me want to swear too loudly for the cat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have an end,\u201d Mara said. \u201cIt just came and then there wasn\u2019t anything else after it, so stopping felt like the only honest thing. I suppose that is art. Or a lapse.\u201d\n\nEdda folded the dishcloth like folding could bring peace to the world. \u201cYou are going to tell men with medals that their medals are on the wrong jackets, eventually. That is not art; that is a personality trait. Eat something so you don\u2019t faint and let them say it was nerves. You will faint when the doctor tells you bad news at sixty-eight and you don\u2019t want me to worry. You will not faint on television.\u201d\n\nMara chewed the bread like a person making a pact. The cat looked up and then put his head back down like fragile men in fragile times everywhere. Her phone vibrated and she picked it up because the habit was stronger than her resolve. Messages jammed themselves into a stream, a messy river of hearts and knives and the sort of anonymous earnestness that smelled weirdly like loneliness. There were four from Kestrel, whose eyeliner could declare a small war, each a different form of profanity that meant I saw you, which was a love letter of its own.\n\nShe sent a reply that was a heart and a thundercloud and a sentence Kestrel would not forgive her for softening. She set the phone back down because it felt like a small animal that might bite her, and she did not have time to be bitten by small animals. She went to the window and looked at the river and thought of how she was supposed to go from here to a building with doors that wanted to close on women like her and call it an accident.\n\nOn the other side of the city, in a place that had learned to be quiet because being loud was disallowed and punished, Silas Brune held a piece of old mortar and drew a circle on the floor with it. The circle wasn\u2019t very good. It had a place that went indented like a soft body under a thumb. He tried again, and the guard on the end of the tier did not tell him to stop because the guard was reading something that pretended to be a magazine and was actually a pamphlet about going south in the spring and growing peppers. Silas had managed to beg another sheet of paper out of the librarian with the soft shoulders and the less soft smile. He had bribed her with a sentence that made her laugh against her will. He wasn\u2019t proud of using his language like that, but he used his hands and his head for worse things; he was economical with his sins when he could be.\n\nThe prison had hummed all night, the way old buildings hum when the pipes have a secret. He had got up twice because the bed had tried to break him into the parts he had tried to avoid thinking about. He had stood at the bars and put his face into the cold and thought of the woman\u2019s voice threaded through the stone like the river got lost in walls. He had not expected music to be a kindness; he was suspicious of kindness under any circumstances. It had not asked him to feel better. It had not forgiven him anything. It had put its arm around his shoulders for three breaths and then gone on to do other work. He respected that sort of love.\n\nThe circle was for a test he had read about in a book someone had smuggled in when he had been a younger man who thought tricks would save him. The book had been confiscated and then thrown back at him because the guard who had opened it had thought the sentences were outside of their job description. Silas closed his eyes and tried to hear one note from the song again. He tried to find the thin thread that had wrapped around his tongue like a wire. He held the pen he had hidden under his mattress and put the tip to the floor and wrote a letter to a woman who did not know his name except in the way a city knows the names of its thieves and its singers.\n\nHe wrote: I do not think you are a miracle. I think you are an accident with exactly the right edges. I think you arrived the way knives arrive in corridors, which is to say someone left a door open and a life went from one room to another.\n\nHe stopped and looked at the sentence and hated himself for the way it assumed he had the right to name her. He wanted to scratch it out and cannot because stone holds what you write on it like a promise. He made the second circle around the first and told himself it was geometry, not superstition. The wall beyond his cell had a seam in it now he could feel with the heel of his hand if he pressed in the right place, a hairline that caught skin like a whisper. He did not intend to dig. He was past intending. He was not past listening.\n\nShortly before ten, the car came for Mara as they had said it would. It had windows that made people look like they were made of a more expensive glass than people generally are. Pax\u2019s driver had the face of a man who had left a war halfway down a hill and would cheerfully drive a car through a wall for the right reasons. Pax was not in the car, which was a relief and a disappointment both. There was a folder on the seat next to her, and the folder contained papers with Pax\u2019s handwriting on them, which looked like a person doing calligraphy while the building burned. There were three talking points in case she needed them. There were eight lines telling her to not read the talking points if she could stand it.\n\nCaelan took the steps up to the Council Tower with a grace that did not belong to a man who had been dead and had been told to walk anyway. The Tower still had the smell of the old Church in it. It did not always acknowledge the difference between men who wore collars because they had saved a city and men who wore collars because they had decided God needed an assistant. He passed under the carved names of those who had drafted the Charter, and he touched two of them out of habit. The third he did not touch because the man had been a genius about sound and a cruel husband, and Caelan tried not to make that sort of compromise before noon.\n\nThe Council chamber had a table that pretended to be a circle and was actually a horseshoe, which was the city in furniture. There were place cards with names and the preference a man had for water with or without lemon. There were microphones like flowers. The Lord Governor sat and did not stand to greet anyone, because it was one of his small pleasures; Caelan did not penalize a man for taking small pleasures, but he kept a ledger of them just in case. Pax was there with a suit jacket his mother would have called impertinent. He had no tie and a pocket square so dark it was almost a laugh about blood.\n\n\u201cI would like to begin with a word we do not often use in this room,\u201d Pax said before anyone else could get their throat around a phrase like public safety. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nThe Lord Governor did not roll his eyes because he had improved his public face in the last year and a half. He made the more subtle move of smoothing his moustache. \u201cWe will dispense with courtesy and go to obligation,\u201d he said, and the clerk\u2019s pencil made a noise like a match striking as if it had independent feelings. \u201cThe Charter of Sound requires consent given in writing and before witnesses before any broadcast intended to awaken the Gates. The singer last night was a young woman with no previous appearance in this chamber and no posted contract on file. You circumvented\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI spoke to her,\u201d Pax said, with his hand flat on the table like he could nail his argument down with it. \u201cI explained the Charter and its protections. She agreed. We recorded her agreement; Roe has the minutes and the time stamp. The Charter is not offended by pop. It is offended by coercion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe city is offended by midnight stunts,\u201d said a man Caelan didn\u2019t particularly care for, whose family owned the rights to most of the city\u2019s night markets and therefore believed himself both a merchant and a poet. \u201cThe city is offended by surprises that make guards call in and wives call out and people stop what they are doing to dance on the kerb. We could have had a panic.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did not,\u201d Caelan said, and allowed his voice to be a little more metal than usual. He preferred to hold tone like a baton rather than swing it, but sometimes it was useful to let the sound show its teeth. \u201cWe had an adjustment. The men and women under my charge yesterday sang at their posts while they did their jobs. Their jobs went well. The ash along the south parapet tells me we made someone across the river think, which is one of my favorite things to make an enemy do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was ash on the parapet?\u201d said the Lord Governor, doing a small acting like he had not known. He had known. \u201cThat should have been sent to the Division.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Division will have their pinch,\u201d Caelan said, and did not smile. \u201cThis is not a meeting about ash. This is a meeting about control. I am here to tell you that sometimes the control you think you hold is the thing that will strangle you. The Charter is alive. It has slept. Last night someone shook it awake. It will snarl if you try to put it in a glass case and admire your reflections upon it.\u201d\n\nPax made a small grateful nonsense noise he probably believed no one heard. Caelan heard everything. He did not turn his head to look at the door when it opened because men who believe themselves to own rooms look at doors. They did not. He could smell her in the hallway before she came in, a sweat that was very clean and very honest, a note of onion and something like metal after rain. The clerk announced her the way clerks do when the room is full and the person in the doorway is the occasion.\n\nMara walked in and her boots made a sound that was not embarrassed. She had put her hair up and then let one piece fall on purpose because she had practiced and then given up and that was the piece that refused her. Her jacket was less cute than last night and more deliberate. She had a small notebook in her hand like a talisman and a look on her face that said she had slept and had not slept, which was the look of every person who had done something their city asked for and then could not decide whether to present a bill.\n\n\u201cThey would like to ask me whether I consent to having consented,\u201d she whispered to Pax when she stood beside him, and he made a small pained parent laugh he would deny until his dying day.\n\n\u201cWe would like to ask you if you understand the role you have thrust yourself into,\u201d the Lord Governor said, and then realized thrust had been a poor choice because the older women on the Council all made the same small face at once. He coughed the kind of cough that means a man has been interrupted by his own vocabulary. \u201cMiss Ives. Thank you for attending. You are very young.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am twenty,\u201d she said, and her voice did not apologize for being twenty. \u201cYou are using words like maiden in my letters. Do you know what it is like to have a city discuss your sexual status before breakfast. I don\u2019t recommend it. I recommend you discuss whether last night helped the Gates breathe and whether I am allowed to decide what to do with my throat.\u201d\n\nThere was a long, delicate silence in which several men moved pens and shuffled papers as if papers might save them from words. Caelan had to restrain an unprofessional noise. He looked down the table and saw two women he had fought beside in the last sick summer hide smiles in their water glasses. The Lord Governor folded his hands as if he could make a church between them.\n\n\u201cWe do not intend to strip you,\u201d he began, and then stopped because he was not that clumsy a man, and yet the word had been standing there waiting and he had walked right into it. \u201cWe do not intend to deprive you of any Charter right. The Charter is the reason the Lancers are yours and not enemies. The Charter restrains us all. The Charter also provides for responsibility. If you wield the Charter ring without the backing of the Choir, you open us to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is the Choir now?\u201d Mara said, and there was no quite successful way for him to say a word like Interim because it would make the room smell of the ruined church on Grave Lane. He did not answer. She put her notebook down so she wouldn\u2019t squeeze it. \u201cThe Choir are women who didn\u2019t want to be told when to sing or what to wear to sing. They left. We wrote new songs in kitchens. The city kept itself from becoming the wrong sort of quiet. I am here as a woman who wants very badly to be small and who can\u2019t be, not now, because someone sent me a ring. My consent is a moving thing. I gave it last night. I am not giving it to you for forever. If I write another song using the Charter, it will be because I have to, not because this room told me it was what nice girls do.\u201d\n\nPax exhaled in a way that was performed for him alone. Caelan took the tenor of the room again and found it had shifted a half step toward honesty and discomfort, which was where things could be done. The Lord Governor adjusted his lemon water and nodded a nod that was both a concession and an investment in later arguments. He glanced down the line at one of his advisors, a thin man whose forefinger had ink under the nail, and the man made a note that would become a policy by afternoon.\n\nThey asked her then the questions they were allowed to ask because they had memorized the Charter\u2019s limits. Did she understand the Gate\u2019s temper, the city\u2019s tendency to vibrate at certain frequencies until people could not hear themselves think and then did dangerous things? Did she have anyone advising her besides Pax, and could Roe be compelled to share the tapes, and did the ring injure her, and had she seen anything while she sang that she interpreted as an omen? She said yes where yes was true and no where no was not untrue. She said Roe was a witch who would eat anyone who tried to compel her and that the tapes were safer with Roe than with any of the men in this room. She said the ring did not injure and also it did, and both were correct. She said she had seen a corridor where a bad choice had been made and that she had no plan to sing in corridors for fun.\n\nThey released her when they realized she was the sort of person whose yeses and nos were not transactions in the way their yeses and nos were. Pax walked her out and then put his back to the closed door and breathed like a man who had come down five flights of stairs too fast. He shook his hands out as if to remove electricity and failed because electricity liked him. He did not hug her because she would have bitten him on instinct.\n\n\u201cYou said what you had to say and you did not give them the parts they wanted,\u201d he said, which was a review and a benediction. \u201cWe have an appearance at noon to explain pop to the sort of person who thinks drums are a conspiracy. Then I will try to stop three newspapers from printing the word virgin in your headline. I will fail at two and win at one because that is the ratio of sin to grace we get in this city.\u201d\n\nMara stood in the corridor and looked at the place where the stone met the wood and thought she could feel a hum that did not belong to buildings and was not hers. It ran along the baseboard like a thin vein. She stepped lightly and it stepped with her for a moment and then hid. \u201cI would like to eat a pastry,\u201d she said. \u201cI would like the pastry to be so sugary it offends someone. I would like to do that before anyone asks me to carry a sword, metaphorical or otherwise.\u201d\n\n\u201cDone,\u201d Pax said, and the relief in his face at a practical request made her want to kick him and pat him on the shoulder at once. \u201cThere is a place with a woman who pretends to hate me and will give you the last perfect thing on the tray if I give her a look that says I remember the war and let her call me names.\u201d\n\nThey went out through the northern doors because the western ones were guarded by people with lenses and Pax had a sense of humor but it did not extend to handing his singer to the people who made their wages out of getting you to say the thing that started the fire. The northern steps were an acceptable small descent into being looked at. A woman with a baby in a sling called, \u201cYou did good,\u201d and then clapped a hand over her mouth as if she had sworn. A man with paint under his nails and the smell of fixative said, \u201cThat chord was illegal,\u201d with the expression of a person who has been waiting his entire life for someone to give him permission to make an error on purpose. A boy with braces yelled her name wrong and looked as if the metal were burning him.\n\nCaelan watched them go from the shade of a column and did not follow. His job this hour was to go to the south parapet and read ash and then to take a dozen Lancers into the tunnels because a scout had heard things he did not like and he was not a man who left dislike alone to behave itself. He sent a single message to Pax that was a warning disguised as a joke: The Division\u2019s eyes have turned foxward. Keep your birds inside. Pax replied with a lightning bolt and a knife and the word soup, because he believed in code as a way to comfort himself.\n\nMarrowgate Prison woke to breakfast like it always did: the sound of trays and the steam that made men think of other kitchens and the sudden loudness of men existing in a space together without the buffers they had in the world. Silas did not get up immediately. He watched the seam in the wall across from him expand a fraction and then stop as if it had changed its mind. He sat up slowly because rushing made the day worse. He put his feet on the floor like they were new and might not trust him yet.\n\nThe guard with the pepper pamphlet came down the tier with his belt jangling like a small bell. He slid the tray into Silas\u2019s cell and did not make a joke about porridge because that had been done for three hundred years too many. \u201cYou get a visitor this afternoon,\u201d he said, as if he were saying a word like shampoo. \u201cDon\u2019t stab him.\u201d\n\nSilas looked up at him and let the silence sit one count longer than comfortable and then asked, \u201cWho?\u201d\n\nThe guard shrugged and failed to make it a movement that did not mean something. \u201cSome woman in a coat with a patch that says she\u2019s a friend of music. Says she\u2019s doing a survey of men who wrote songs when they were young and then made mistakes. I said we didn\u2019t have any of those. She said, \u2018Then I will take a man who used to write letters and forgot how.\u2019 She gave me an apple and it didn\u2019t look poisoned. You should shave. You look like you sawed your face with a spoon.\u201d\n\nSilas did not laugh at the spoon because he had once seen a man open another man with a spoon, and you can only laugh at some things in some rooms and live. He waited until the guard had gone and then he put his hands against the seam again and the seam did not respond because it was morning and the song was not throbbing through the stone the way it had last night. He told himself not to imagine that a woman with a coat was going to bring him a rope made of sound. He told himself he would be polite and not tell her the alternative life he was writing had her room in it. He told himself and did not believe himself because the morning had arrived and with it the small unnatural hope that comes when magic has crossed a city you lived in long enough to think you had mapped.\n\nThe pastry shop was the sort of place you bring secrets and pretend they are crumbs. It had windows with hand lettering and a woman behind the counter with a mouth that could stop a clock. Pax went in like a man entering confession. The woman said his name with the precise weight that suggests you once took a bullet together and also that she believes he owes her five favors. She looked at Mara and made the small noise mothers make when a child is in the room who has done a thing for the house and is now standing there with their hair not quite combed.\n\n\u201cI have nothing left but the things no one else can carry,\u201d the woman said, and lifted a tray where three squares rested with sugar on them like the first snow on a roof. \u201cAlso a doughnut that is having an identity crisis.\u201d\n\nMara chose a square and regretted not being able to choose all of them the way a person regrets not being able to live all their lives. She put the first bite in her mouth and nearly cried because it tasted like butter and sugar and the absence of violence. Pax ate the identity crisis and looked like a man who deserved his fate. The shop was full of people being ordinary at high volume. A girl at the corner table had taken a guitar out and was playing the wrong chords with such determination you had to approve. A boy at the window was drawing a map of the city onto his sleeve with a pen because sometimes you had to carry the place you belonged on your body like a threat.\n\n\u201cI got a letter,\u201d the woman said to Pax, and put her hands on the counter to force him to be serious. \u201cIt says they will audit me. It says I had twenty-two rolls go missing in a week and the City thinks that means I am paying for certain things with bread. I am paying for nothing with bread except my rent and a boy who insists hot chocolate is a human right.\u201d\n\nPax made a face at the word audit the way men made faces in the old days when a priest said confession and meant theater. \u201cYou give the Lancers a tray twice a week when something goes wrong at their training. I pull you out of the audit by afternoon. You plan in case I cannot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have never been without a plan,\u201d she said, and glanced at Mara the way you glance when you are making sure someone eats enough to do what you know they have to do. \u201cDon\u2019t let them tell you you are a thing they own. A room full of men is a room full of wishful thinking. You do the part you can live with. You give the rest to whoever pretends to like suffering and suits.\u201d\n\nOutside, the street had decided that looking was not impolite if you did it with admiration instead of intrusiveness, which would have been flattering if admiration did not have a way of turning to hunger without warning. Kestrel found her outside the pastry shop the way bird dogs find things they have flushed, with her eyeliner like two precise wounds and her grin like a charm twice used and still potent. She grabbed Mara\u2019s wrist and then remembered she was a person and not her scarf and let go.\n\n\u201cYou did it,\u201d Kestrel said, and then shook her head hard enough to upset her balance. \u201cNo. You did a thing no one else can be caught doing. That\u2019s ruder, which I respect more. I heard men trying to decide if they could still like ballads. I told them their grandmothers listened to laments while they repaired roof tiles and they made babies to the sound of rain, so yes.\u201d\n\nMara breathed in Kestrel\u2019s smell of cigarettes she didn\u2019t smoke and perfume she pretended she couldn\u2019t afford. \u201cThe city is being very loud,\u201d she said, and Kestrel bumped her shoulder the way women bump each other when pushing a car out of mud.\n\n\u201cThey are going to eat you and then worship you and then want your skin as wallpaper. That\u2019s the ritual. You are going to have to learn to want things loudly so there\u2019s no room for their wants. I brought you this,\u201d Kestrel said, and shoved a pair of sunglasses at her that looked like they belonged to someone who lived on a balcony. \u201cThey will not help. They will make you feel like they help, which sometimes is the only help anyone can give.\u201d\n\nThey were laughing, the kind of laughing that has claws and helps anyway, when a man stepped away from the shadow of a doorway and smiled with the flexible mouth of a person trained to convince you of nice things and bad things at once. He wore a coat that belonged to the office called Annotations, a coat that said, We like documents and order and we would like to know the details of the life you are living so we can make a better list. He held a white envelope the way you hold bread. He was careful with his eyes; he did not look directly at the ring.\n\n\u201cMiss Ives,\u201d he said, and somehow the way he said it made Pax appear between Mara and the space the man was standing like a very elegant storm. \u201cApologies for the abruptness. My name\u2019s Aron Tull, from Annotations. We\u2019re all very proud. We would like to make certain your documents smile in the correct places. Small thing. A signature on a form that says\u2014officially, you know\u2014that the ring is presently in your custody and that you understanding its chain of provenance is under investigation.\u201d\n\nPax had been built for moments when men came with paper and tried to turn the world into a series of squares they could move around without looking up. He took the envelope like a man accepts a compliment, with half a smile and three teeth. \u201cMy documents will giggle when they see yours,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will bring them to your office after we have taught them manners. Good morning.\u201d\n\nThe man moved as if to insist and then had the rare survival instinct that told him a bad morning could become a very bad morning if he moved his hand in a particular way. He left his card. He walked away the way men walk when they think you are going to watch them. Pax put the envelope into his coat because he never threw anything away until he had read it three times with and without the lights on. He did not tell Mara not to worry because that is a useless sentence.\n\n\u201cMen in coats,\u201d said Kestrel, because some advice you carry with you because your mother was right the first time and you don\u2019t need to improve it. \u201cEdda will cut him to ribbons with a bread knife.\u201d\n\nThere was a tremor underfoot that made all three of them adjust their balance. It was not a subway or a cart. It was not the wind. It was the Gates giving a breath and then holding it. People on the street went quiet the way city people do when the thing that keeps their corners in place reminds them that it can move. Mara felt the ring against her bone though she wasn\u2019t touching it, which was alarming and then embarrassing because it meant she had thought she could leave it on the windowsill and be its boss.\n\nCaelan and a dozen Lancers were already underground by then, not beneath the Gates themselves but beneath the parts of the city the Gates had loved in other lives. The tunnels smelled like drowned metal and stories. Their lights made the sort of small sound lights make when they touch old magic and pretend it is dust. Jaro, a soldier with a laugh that had survived too many things, was to his right, and Ran, who had once taken a vow that she didn\u2019t realize tied her to nine years of being angry and then broke it in a courtyard with rain, was to his left.\n\nThey moved along the curve of a maintenance passage until it opened onto a chamber that had been a place for sorting before the Ash Wars. The Chamber of Numbers had seen the movement of as many people as any cathedral. Caelan told them to hold, because holding could save lives as often as it cost them. He closed his eyes with a soldier\u2019s arrogance and he looked with the kind of looking that had nothing to do with sight. The song had left a residue here. It had dusted the old markings into relief the way a child rubs charcoal over paper to show a coin\u2019s face.\n\nThere was ash, but it wasn\u2019t scattered. It was arranged in a shape that had no reason to be alive and was. It looked like a door when you squinted. It looked like a hand when you didn\u2019t. It looked like someone had tried to teach the ash to speak and had gotten as far as a letter O and then had to run. Caelan stepped closer and the ash formed itself in the smallest shiver that could be written off as your own heart. He put his hand out and stopped before his palm touched empty air. He left it there like a man considering a handshake.\n\n\u201cDo we touch it,\u201d Jaro said, and stood like a man who has decided not to die today if he can help it.\n\n\u201cWe ask it a question first,\u201d Caelan said. He pitched his voice to the tone you use for dogs you trust and children you love and old gods you suspect might have finally improved their tempers. \u201cWho sent you.\u201d\n\nThe ash moved with the delicacy of falling hair. The O became a shape the warders would recognize as a sign from before. It wasn\u2019t a word, not in their alphabet. It was a pressure that made you think of a body leaning against a door. Ran swore and then apologized to a deity she did not believe in because swearing is sometimes a social reflex.\n\n\u201cSomeone is pushing,\u201d Caelan said. \u201cIt is not the Sovereign. He does not knock. He makes holes and calls them entrances.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen who,\u201d Ran said, and got no answer because the city was busy and had not scheduled a moment for that answer to arrive. The ash dropped as if a hand had withdrawn. The chamber returned to being a place where numbers had been sorted. Caelan inhaled and tasted sugar in the air where there should have been rust. He filed that away next to the word Kestrel in his mind because he needed the women in eyeliner to live and keep their secrets and there was only so much space for sugar underground.\n\nMara stood on the steps of a building that would like to have been in a different argument and answered three questions before she was asked. She said the ring did not make her sane or insane. She said she liked drums and ballads and songs that made a street stop spinning. She said she would finish a pastry before she finished a thought if she could manage it. Then she did the thing that was going to make Pax say Please don\u2019t hurt me later. She took the ring out and put it on her finger in front of the cameras and nothing happened for a heartbeat and then, because the world could not help itself, something did.\n\nThe lights on the street flickered in time to the memory of the song and then steadied. The Gates two bridges away inhaled and exhaled like men in a line preparing to step into their night. Edda right then at her kitchen table slapped a hand down over the headlines that tried to enter her house like rude relatives and said, \u201cStop it,\u201d and then laughed at herself because she had just told the city to mind its manners.\n\nIn Marrowgate, Silas\u2019s visitor came in smelling like lavender and dust and the inside of new books. She wore a coat with a patch that did say Friend of Music, which was a polite lie. Silas stood because he believed in theater when there was very little else to believe in. She had a file in her hands and a look in her eyes like she enjoyed finding holes and putting names into them. She set the file down and looked at his circles on the floor and at his face and then at the seam in the wall and he saw the moment she decided to pretend she had not seen anything. He admired that sort of professionalism. It was a hell of a thing to pretend to miss something and then make sure your job remembered you had.\n\n\u201cYou wrote songs once,\u201d she said, and the vowels admitted she had parents who had wanted her to speak like a teacher and a child who had taught her how not to. \u201cLetters after that. We have a program. We take men who are good with sentences and teach them how to put them into places where the city can\u2019t do much damage. Grant writing. Public notices. A pamphlet about teaching kettles to purr.\u201d\n\nSilas looked at her hands and noticed they were too clean for a person who handled files. He wondered if her desk had been invented for her so she could put out her hands to make people think she came from paper. \u201cI killed a boy in a corridor,\u201d he said, and he did not soften it because softening things is lying and this was not a room that wanted lies; it was a room that wanted unpleasantries said with a flat tone so they could be filed.\n\nShe did not flinch the way men flinch. She made a small noise in her throat like a woman who had once cut her hand on a jar and did not tell anyone and got on with the soup. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cThe boy was part of a list I keep. The list is in my head because paper is too kind. You do not get out of jail because you write a pamphlet. Don\u2019t ask. It makes the conversation long and then makes me late to the next conversation. You could write in here. You could make lines other people will read and keep. You could stop writing to a woman you think you can save if you call her in the right tense.\u201d\n\nSilas put his hands on the table and thought if he pressed hard enough his palms would grow roots and he would be a tree with a man\u2019s head and birds would nest in his hair. \u201cI am not writing to save anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cI am writing so there is a version of me somewhere that does not deserve what he has and does not try to make that mean anything.\u201d\n\nShe nodded. She slid a stapled packet across the table, which was the shape of this conversation. He could either staple himself to something or not. There was a line on the second page where he could let words become wages in a place that had none. She reached into her bag and put an apple on the table because apparently this week men in rooms with no fruit got apples. He wanted to make a joke about it but no joke was as funny as living. She said her name was Lale. She did not tell him where she bought the coat patch. He signed, because there are forms of hope that do not embarrass you and this was one.\n\nWhen the second noon had got itself done, and the city had decided it still existed, Mara sat in the back of another car and stared at her hands and tried to decide if they were hers. Pax had a voice left and used it to tell someone that if they wanted to film her mother\u2019s building they should wear nicer shoes. He had a voice left because Roe had given him a throat lozenge that made you feel like a library was opening in your chest. Caelan had sent a message that said simply, south tunnels. Later. Because he had set aside a sliver of a day to tell her something about swords and the parts of a city that refused to be drawn on a map, and because he could smell the other thing coming and wanted not to waste time when time made faces.\n\nThere was a gift waiting when she got upstairs that made Edda say three syllables of an old prayer, which is two syllables and a hand. It was a bouquet of paper flowers, folded with such care it almost made you like their maker, except that when Mara touched the edge of a petal it turned to ash. There was a small card with handwriting too polite. It said: Return the ring to sleep. It said: We will be gentle first.\n\nEdda took the flowers to the sink and ran water over them as if water could outvote ritual, and they did not turn to ash under the tap. They stayed paper and ugly. Mara put her hand on the counter and tried to decide if she was a person who would be frightened now or later. The ring lay where she had left it on the sill and did not hum. Pax\u2019s messages burned holes in her pocket. Caelan\u2019s promise sat like a stone at the bottom of a river. The city was being very honest about wanting to rearrange her.\n\nThat night, when men in coats had drunk their tea and gone home to houses in neighborhoods that didn\u2019t get ash on the parapets, when the Lancers had eaten something like food and laughed at jokes they would not remember next week, when Kestrel came by and pretended she needed to borrow salt and left with three jars of jam and a glare, Mara took the ring into the bathroom like it was a confidante. She sat on the closed lid of the toilet and looked at her face and did not decide whether she liked it. She put the ring on and said a number out loud she had not said in public in fifteen years. The ring made a sound like a kettle remembering itself.\n\nThe melody that arrived was not the one she had made. It was narrower. It was the sort of tune an alley might sing to announce that it was safe to leave a back door unlatched for someone who needed to come in and sit on the floor for a minute. She hummed into it and let words catch. She did not think about audiences. She did not think about Ash. She thought about men in rooms who wrote their other lives on stone and women who hit rings with their knuckles and made them behave. She thought about drums and onion soup and the way sugar can taste underground if you are careful.\n\nDown in the south tunnels, Caelan put his hand to the place where the ash had been and felt nothing but cool stone and the memory of a pressure like a stranger\u2019s forehead against yours. Jaro said something obscene about luck and Ran reminded him luck is a person and she charges rent. They turned to go and three of them turned back because they thought they heard a man laughing. It wasn\u2019t a nice laugh. It was the kind of laugh that shakes out of a person like a cough. The sound didn\u2019t come from the door shape or the O or any of the places a sensible man would look. It came from a seam in the wall that would not be a seam unless you were the sort of person who had read too many names and asked for more.\n\nCaelan touched the seam without touching it. He thought of a corridor and a boy and a knife and a long thin wire of a song pulled taut through someone else\u2019s throat. He did not know that across the city a man in a cell had just signed his name to a program that would teach him to name objects until naming them made him less of one. He did not know that a woman upstairs in a bathroom on a street with old trees had just found a tune you could carry home in your pocket without anyone noticing.\n\nHe did know the difference between knocking and not. He knew that the Ash Sovereign did not ask for permission. He knew someone else might. He kept his hand steady over the seam and said the sort of sentence you say to a room when you would like it to believe you are not afraid and would like to believe that too. He said, \u201cNot tonight.\u201d\n\nThe seam held. The room did not open. The ash did not return. The city, tired of pretending, rolled itself onto the other shoulder and slept the kind of sleep that admits it has a problem. In apartments like explosives and closets like boats, people relistened because relistening is a form of prayer. In a prison like a throat, a man fell asleep with ink on his fingers. In a kitchen like a safe place, a mother put a bowl over a paper flower and decided it wasn\u2019t allowed to harm her house because she said so. In a tower like a mistake, a governor wrote a sentence in a speech that included the word maiden, and then crossed it out, and wrote it again, and crossed it out again, and settled for citizen because he had to live with the women who would hear him.\n\nAt the window in the blue-threaded light of three in the morning, Mara pressed her palm flat to the pane. The ring was warm. The river moved as if someone had put a chord under it. She did not promise herself away. She did not promise herself to herself, either; the world had taught her that was a dangerous sort of vow. She breathed and counted to seven and then lost the numbers because a rhythm had found her that was not counting and was not silence and was not the city taking what it wanted. It was the small sound you make when you decide to be brave again tomorrow. It was not an anthem. It did not have a beat you could dance to, unless your dance was the sort where you lean on a counter and laugh too loud so you will know you are alive.Morning took a long time deciding to arrive in the Old Weavers and, when it did, it came through the kitchen window like someone late to a party bringing bread to apologize. Edda had already done the practical warfare of wiping down the table twice, not because it was dirty but because doing so put the world temporarily into her jurisdiction. The paper flower sat under a mixing bowl, which made the cat very religious about the bowl, circling it and saying quiet cat things to it as if prayer would keep unfortunate paper from learning new tricks. Mara poured tea and did not put the ring on until she had watched the steam for three long breaths and decided she had the edges for it. The weight on her finger altered the taste of the tea; she could taste a faint metal that was not cup and not spoon, an optimism that made her want to swear and knock on wood simultaneously.\n\nKestrel arrived with a speed that made you suspect she had been downstairs on the second-floor landing timing the moments between footsteps. She threw herself into a chair like it was about to be stolen and put a folded piece of onion-skin paper on the table with reverence and profanity co-existing in the gesture. The paper was thinner than a whisper and twice as sure of itself. Inside it, a hand had written with a nib that had a lot of opinions: We have hot water and we do not waste it on men. Bring your throat. Old Baths, noon. It smelled faintly of rosemary, the way old sweat can if it has been mixed with years of soap and women\u2019s conversations about things no council ever included on their agendas.\n\nEdda dried her hands and looked at the paper like it came from a school friend she had laughed with three governments ago. She touched the edge and then touched Mara\u2019s wrist. \u201cYou should go,\u201d she said, and the should had a weight to it like a bowl you set down firmly so that it doesn\u2019t try to participate in the argument. \u201cIf you are going to carry a ring with this much bad manners, you should at least speak with the women who taught the last one to mind its shoes indoors.\u201d\n\nMara wanted to say she had a meeting with Pax and another meeting with a man whose job title was a form of apology, but the paper\u2019s rosemary smell reached into her and arranged her objections into less useful shapes. She drank the tea. She ate the end of a heel of bread she did not want. She put her hand flat over the bowl with the paper flower and felt nothing but porcelain and inherited stubbornness, which relieved her more than she expected it to. \u201cNoon,\u201d she said, and saw the way both women in the room half exhaled like a bellows releasing.\n\nThe Old Baths had been retired three times\u2014by war, by fashion, by men who liked to put taxes on things women enjoyed\u2014and survived each retirement by pretending to be a ruin until the new rules forgot they existed. The street outside them did not remember when carriages had clattered and men had tipped hats; it remembered quilts hung on lines and steam like early fog and small, savage arguments over which soap made the best lather for hair that behaved like weather. The door had a polite sign that said Closed for Private Restoration, which was the city\u2019s way of saying You do not have enough knowledge to come in right now. Kestrel knocked the knock women knock in funny corners to tell other women they are not here to rearrange anybody. The lock took a moment to remember who it had been forged for and then yielded with a sound like a small regret.\n\nInside, the air was gratitude and humidity. The tiled room had not been allowed to be pretty; it had insisted on it instead. On the far wall, under a fresco of women with hair like rivers who had lasted out three faiths and never been repainted, sat six women and a kettle. They were not old or young. They were all the ages that mattered. Three of them were now-famous cowards who had refused to stand up and sing when asked by a dead church with a live appetite and the city had survived anyway. Two wore smocks. One wore a coat with pockets that were either full of instruments or full of small knives. None of them stood. None of them smiled in the preliminary way.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d said the one in the coat, who had salt on her cuffs and steam in her voice. \u201cYou argued with the water last night until it remembered it needed to boil. Sit. Shoes off. Rings off. We do not drop things in the hot that we haven\u2019t named.\u201d\n\nMara took off her boots and set them aside with the care you use for friends. She slipped the ring and put it on her palm. It hummed exactly once like a short laugh, and then made a display of being obedient. She sat on the tile, which cooled her at once and made her feel like a child at kitchen level. Kestrel sat cross-legged beside her, and the eyeliner made her look like a very precise heretic. The kettle poured into small cups as if pouring were a sacrament and not a mechanics of gravity.\n\n\u201cWe are not the Choir,\u201d said a woman with a line of scars that disappeared under the neck of her shirt and reappeared near her wrist like a small river that got lost and then found itself again. \u201cWe were the whisper behind the Choir, the aunties, the thieves, the ones who wrote the lists when the men thought lists were theirs. The Choir scattered rather than be told when to inhale. We did not scatter. We went to make soap and raise boys and teach girls that singing is not performance, it is barricade. The card you got was rude. We do apologies after. I am Soria.\u201d\n\nMara balanced the cup in both hands and dared to smell it. It was not rosemary. It was lavender and something like iron. It was the smell of the basin in her grandmother\u2019s yard, the one she remembered without ever having seen. \u201cI am Mara,\u201d she said, and felt foolish at introducing herself to women who had already decided what she was to them. \u201cI have something that doesn\u2019t belong to me and I used it and it worked and now the city is making noises like furniture being dragged upstairs at an hour when furniture should not be dragged anywhere. I don\u2019t want to be owned by it. Or by the city. Or by anyone with a patch. I also don\u2019t want to let the Gates go back to sleep. How ridiculous to want anything at all.\u201d\n\nKestrel put a shoulder lightly against Mara\u2019s as if to stop her from listing too hard. Soria made a how-old-are-you face that had nothing to do with numbers and everything to do with what you had given up to keep your throat for yourself. \u201cIt does not belong to anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cThe ring belongs to the city we want, not to the city we have. It is not obedient. It prefers cleverness. You have some. You will need more. They will ask you to give it back to sleep. They will say that sleep is safer. Perhaps for them. You will go on not sleeping well for a while. The only thing you must not do is pretend to be quiet when you are not built for it. That will ruin you. We prefer our girls unruined, or at least ruined in interesting ways that annoy the correct men.\u201d\n\nA laugh went around the tile like quick water. Mara tried out the smile that was showing up on the faces of women who were not her and found that it fit her mouth as if it had been there before. \u201cThe song last night,\u201d said the one with the pockets of tools or knives, and her voice had a tiny line in it that said she had once been paid to sing to men who could not find sleep any other way. \u201cThere was a bleed. Did you feel it.\u201d\n\nMara thought of sugar underground and men in tunnels tasting sweets that had no business in rust. \u201cSomething else rode it,\u201d she said, and the women made the sound women make when they have been waiting to hear someone else say the thing their bodies had already told them. \u201cI was told to keep it dirty and I did and something took the dirt and drew in it. It made an O. It pressed itself against a door and did not knock.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ash faction isn\u2019t interested in asking,\u201d said Soria, which made the tile feel briefly colder. \u201cThat is someone else. We thought perhaps one of the Quiets had gotten out of a grave and decided to be polite before being unkind. But the politeness smelled like sugar, which they thought was a sin and which we know to be breakfast. There is a girl under the river who uses sugar to teach ash to be letters. She is either going to save us or make a very beautiful mess. Both, probably.\u201d\n\nKestrel made a face that announced her two opinions about girls under rivers and both of those opinions involved rescuing and lecturing. Mara looked down at the ring and thought about letters that were almost doors and men laughing where they should not be allowed to. \u201cI heard a laugh,\u201d she said, and watched the flinch happen not on Soria\u2019s face but in the shoulders of the woman three over, who had put her cup down without quite knowing she was going to. \u201cIt was not near me. It was near a seam someone I don\u2019t know was not touching. I dislike laughter without a body. It makes my skin feel like it\u2019s being written on.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will have to learn seams,\u201d said Soria. \u201cThey are where the city keeps its forgettings. They are often next to places where men are stored. You will leave those alone unless you intend to open them and what comes out is your responsibility forever. We will teach you the vowel that tells seams they are unattractive to you. It is a vowel men cannot make well because it requires a flexibility they do not cultivate.\u201d\n\nThey did not sing in the way Mara had expected women in an old bath to sing. They breathed on a note together and the room shifted the way a large animal adjusts under your hand so your palm rests in the right place for its bones. They showed her how to shape her mouth to make the safer-latch tune she had invented last night sit on her tongue and ready itself to be given away without robbing her more than she could spare. They put her feet in hot water and told her to count until she forgot numbers and remembered rhythm. They told her to think of onion soup and then of knives. They told her to invent for herself an ugly cheer so that when she had to sing beautiful she would still have an unbeautiful thing she could hold that was just for her.\n\nWhen they were done teaching her the vowel and three bad-tempered consonants that belonged with it, Soria took the ring on her palm and let the water fog roll over it. The ring fogged and then cleared itself without anyone making a move. The women nodded because sometimes your tools are alive and it is good to see them wipe their own mouth after eating. \u201cThey will want to audit you,\u201d Soria said, passing the ring back. \u201cThey will want to list your body and the parts of it they think belong to documents. If you sign, make sure the paper becomes yours. Name it. Bite it a little if you have to.\u201d\n\nOutside, noon made light like a man whittling a piece of wood and getting too much pleasure out of the neatness of the curls. Pax was in the car because of course he was; he had a way of being where you had decided you would need him five minutes before you knew you would. He wore a tie now as a personal experiment in not cursing at men older than him when he had to say sentences with words like proper channels in them. He opened the door and his face made the expression a person makes when they see a room has rinsed you and given you back your skin. It was both admiration and end-of-the-world relief. Kestrel did a little bow so low it upset two pigeons and slid in after Mara like she had paid to be there and refused a refund.\n\n\u201cThey want to log the ring as an object of city interest,\u201d Pax said without saying hello, because hello felt like a word you used when nothing was on fire. \u201cAnnotations sent a form that is almost reasonable, which makes me suspicious. The Division wants a copy. The Lord Governor wants a statement we write for him that makes him sound less like a man who was delivered to this job as a prank. Roe wants to know if you swallowed a bee on that fifth phrase because she can weave it out if it starts to sting the wrong place. Also the pastry woman sent me a note that says she will accept my promise and my favor and would I like jam.\u201d\n\nMara held the ring in her fist because it made her feel less like a thing with a handle. \u201cI went to the Baths,\u201d she said, and Pax\u2019s eyes did the small close-lid thing like a man closing the door to his better nature before he said something careless. \u201cThey taught me a vowel. They told me not to open seams even if someone with a laugh asks me to. They used sugar to talk about ash. There is a girl under the river doing geometry with candy and we should either help her or steal her, and I find that I am too tired to know which is moral.\u201d\n\nPax turned his head just enough that she could see the part of his face that would never be televised, the part that got young when he was letting himself be more dangerous than useful. \u201cGood,\u201d he said softly. \u201cIf they like you they will save your life two or three times in ways that aren\u2019t dramatic enough to be fun. If they don\u2019t like you they will merely keep you from embarrassing yourself in public, which is kindness of another order. We have to go to Annotations. We will smile and use the word consent until a man tries to bite his tongue off.\u201d\n\nAnnotations lived in a building that had been a bank and had not learned to be different. The foyer had floors that made your heel sound seditious. The elevator smelled oily and safe. The reception desk was a beautiful woman with a mouth like a ledger. Aron Tull met them with a card already in his hand, which meant he had practiced the smile he wanted to wear when the person he intended to put in a folder arrived not wanting to be a folder. He wore gray the way some men wear wars, like a garment they were never meant to take off.\n\n\u201cThe form is a form,\u201d he said, and even his hands looked like paper. \u201cIt says the object is declared, the chain of provenance is under inquiry, and the bearer is recognized as temporarily authorized for civic broadcast activities under supervision. It protects you. It protects us from you. It protects the city from both of us.\u201d\n\nPax sat with the elegant violence of a man who knows the power of chairs and is prepared to wield it. \u201cIt is ten words too long,\u201d he said, and smiled with nine teeth and not the tenth. \u201cIt says supervision. The Charter says counsel. It is a famous difference. It says chain of provenance, which would be a lovely phrase to write poetry about if you were a poet and it did not mean men with stamps get to tell stories about women\u2019s throats. You may have a form. It may not have that language.\u201d\n\nAron\u2019s expression did a small calculation that would have been attractive if it were not being performed on a person he wanted to inventory. \u201cWe can change a word,\u201d he conceded as if he were lowering a drawbridge in a house with no moat. \u201cWe would also like an impression of the ring. For the registry.\u201d\n\nMara put her hands on the table and her ring hand not on the paper. She could feel Kestrel next to her making a silent scream face because Kestrel had never met a registry she liked. She looked at the page and thought of Soria\u2019s advice. She thought of biting. She thought of naming paper until it belonged to her instead of to the man who had printed it. She picked up the pen and wrote her name and then, without asking, wrote: I name this paper and its brothers a comfort. You may not be used to being named. Learn.\n\nAron read the sentence and smiled in the way men smile when they have been outflanked in a petty way and intend to win later when no one is watching. \u201cWe respect language,\u201d he said, and put a stamp on the bottom that made the sheet buzz very gently like it had swallowed a fly. \u201cWe will get out of your hair. Do remember to return our calls. If the Sovereign\u2019s ash starts to shake itself onto our chairs and leave shape-words, we will wish we had more forms, not fewer.\u201d\n\nThey left with a copy of the paper that had learned its new name and with a memory of Aron\u2019s smile that would be useful later in identifying which weapon he thought he was holding. Pax put his hand on the low of Mara\u2019s back as they walked out, his fingers an inch away from contact as if he were restraining himself from being the sort of man who guided women with his palm. \u201cThey are going to try very nicely,\u201d he said in the tone men used to talk about storms when the windows were already rattling. \u201cThe Division will not be nice. I have a friend on the lower stairs who thinks he can keep the word custodian off your file. That friend will either become our problem soon or our prayer. Meanwhile, Roe is in a mood. She found something in the recording she has not seen since\u2014well. Since I had a different hairstyle and did not believe in my own death.\u201d\n\nHollow Sun was a different building by daylight. It had been designed to make you love it at night, which meant that in the morning it looked like the aftermath of a party you were too clever to attend. Roe was in her chair, which was not a throne because she would have burned a throne for warmth. She had four screens up: one with waveforms, one with a map of the old Quietite runes lit to show passage, one with a cartoon cat, and one with a list of equipment requests she had previously been told were extravagant and would now be met because the city had remembered to be frightened.\n\n\u201cYou invited a passenger,\u201d she said without saying hello, and pointed with her chin at the waveform where, under Mara\u2019s vocal, there ran the faintest of other voices like a silk thread under a coarse seam. \u201cYou left the line open and something leaned in and said its name without saying it. This is not ash. This is\u2014this is something that knows the old way a door opens and has been respectful about knocking because it wants to be invited to dinner rather than let itself in and eat the cat.\u201d\n\nPax took his jacket off as if he had been dying to do so since breakfast. \u201cSugar,\u201d he said, because he liked to get there first sometimes even when it didn\u2019t matter. \u201cCaelan smelled sugar underground. Soria says there\u2019s a girl with lessons in candy. You\u2019re telling us the ring chased itself down a sweet and found a seam.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am telling you not to open it,\u201d Roe said, and looked at Mara with the unsmiling courtesy of someone who had stood beside enough disasters to have a palate for their taste. \u201cYou are tired and tired people make bargains with doors because doors look like answers when your feet hurt. The seam has a frequency. I will write you the note that tells it to mind its business for a day and a night. After that, if it is still polite, we ask it if its mother taught it to rinse cups or put them in the sink dirty. That will tell us which side raised it.\u201d\n\nThe day tried very hard, then, to behave like a day. They did three interviews. Mara answered questions while wearing sunglasses that did not make her invisible and did make her feel like a friend of theirs would appear if she reached for her pocket. Pax lied successfully on her behalf twice and was honest once on accident. Roe delivered the note handwritten on the back of a bus schedule: a set of bars with no clef and the barest notations in the corner in an alphabet that did not announce itself to strangers. Kestrel stole three pastries and shared two. Edda called twice to ask if anyone would be home to eat the stew that had suddenly decided it needed to exist.\n\nBy late afternoon, the part of a city\u2019s day when everyone\u2019s temper gets thin and their posture worse, Caelan sent a message that was not a message, because he did not believe in making himself easy to subpoena. It was a bouquet of words delivered by a boy who smelled of coal dust and soup: bridge, south, sugar again, be clever, no heroics. Pax read it and did a thing with his mouth that meant he would be heroic in a way no one could blame him for later. Mara read it and felt an irritation that was almost relief. Kestrel read it and said absolutely not out loud and then yes under her breath because the under-breath is where your bravery negotiates with your sense.\n\nThe bridge at South Span had several moods, and that afternoon it wore the one that said it had put up with hurricanes and weddings and men who thought a proposal needed an audience; it would put up with this as well. Lancers in plain clothes had made the crowd look like a crowd that did not intend to panic. Caelan was where he belonged in a space like that: nowhere obvious and everywhere at once, the way a sound can come from a wall you didn\u2019t realize had a body behind it. The ash traces were not dramatic. They were less than the dust from a baker\u2019s sleeve and more than should be, arranged in a shape that had gotten to the second letter and been interrupted by a hand that decided to behave. There was sugar too, which glittered when the light hit it and sank into the ash with the tenderness of ingredients in a batter.\n\n\u201cWe are going to keep people moving,\u201d Caelan said into the small boil of attention Pax carried with him into any scene. \u201cWe are not going to say the words you must not say. We are going to stand here like the city watching the river and we are not going to be impressed. We are not going to be provoked. If the seam shows its teeth, you are going to sing that note Roe gave you quietly enough that only doors hear it. If the ash tries to be beautiful, you will not praise it.\u201d\n\nMara nodded because nodding was safer than promising. The ring warmed without asking her permission to do so. She took a position not in the middle and not on the edge and watched the light change along the surface of the river with the kind of attention that makes you forget where your hands are. The crowd, being a crowd, did crowd things: moved forward, moved back, made a sound that was half complaint and half thrill. Kestrel started a conversation with a woman whose job was cutting keys and who had strong opinions about the way men understood locks and none of those opinions were positive. Pax, as was his religious habit, refused to stand still and therefore could be in four very necessary places in five minutes.\n\nThe seam made the smallest surrender of itself and then stopped. The ash became an O again the way a mouth does when it has decided to say one thing and thinks better of it. The sugar glinted as if some ridiculous child under the river had whispered Now. Mara put the note in her mouth and hummed it inward like a coin you swallow because someone is trying to take it from you. The seam did not open. It acknowledged and retreated. Caelan relaxed a degree no one else on the bridge was trained to detect.\n\nIt would have ended as well as anything ends in a city like Eydolon\u2014untidily and almost\u2014if three men had not decided they were very tired of quiet. They were not ash. They were not sugar. They were the sort of men who sell other men maps to places that never existed and then get offended when those men show up at their doors and ask for a refund. They had knives they were proud of and jackets that made them look like they had joined a club which would let in any man who liked jackets. One of them had a paper flower pinned to his lapel with a safety pin, and the paper did not turn to ash because whoever had made it had calculated the weather.\n\nThey moved toward the place where the seam had let its O be visible and Caelan was there before their forward momentum could get them into any useful trouble. He did not draw a weapon. He did not need to. The particular way he put his foot down was architectural; the air around a step like that gets busy making a wall because it suspects it might be safer to be masonry right now. The man with the paper flower smiled a smile he had practiced in front of a mirror with the sound of other people\u2019s fear as his accompaniment. \u201cWe just want a look,\u201d he said, inserting his voice into the public space the way you insert a knife into a letter you are not meant to read. \u201cWant to see what the city thinks it\u2019s hiding.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the city keeps to itself,\u201d Caelan said, and his tone did not rise, \u201cis the reason you can stand here this afternoon and pretend to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nThe man looked past him with the audacity of fools. He saw Mara and did a small calculation almost as quickly as Aron Tull had and came up with different numbers. He did not look at her hands because some men are very good at not looking where you ought to look and very bad at looking where you must not. \u201cSinger,\u201d he said, with the tone that makes the word an accusation and a proposition at once. \u201cYou brought a song down here. Sing again. Let it through.\u201d\n\nMara had spent a long time in rooms where men told her to smile and did not believe her when she said, No. The old baths had put a vowel in her mouth that told the city to look elsewhere. Roe\u2019s bus-schedule had drawn her a line to keep her feet on. She touched the ring with the thumb of her other hand because a part of her was still a fool for ritual. Then she said, very pleasantly, as if she were at the pastry counter and the last beautiful thing had just been bought by someone else, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nThe man smiled because he thought he was owed another word. He reached for her because men who think they are owed say more with their arms than with their mouths. He did not reach her. Caelan moved without the flourish he could allow himself when he fought men with practice. He put two fingers against the man\u2019s wrist and reminded the man of the anatomy he had forgotten, that there is a bone under the skin that will tell you stories you cannot pretend are not true. The knife dropped, which was undramatic but helpful. Jaro relieved a second man of the pretense he had ever been allowed to be dangerous in public, and Ran spoke softly into the ear of the third until his body remembered that breathing is a condition and not a promise.\n\nThere was a moment when it could have become a thing people wrote speeches about. The seam did its small not-enough trick. The ash lifted and made the barest flourish of a new shape. The sugar drifted like snow. Kestrel grabbed Mara\u2019s elbow and pretended she was the one holding her up when what she was doing was making herself a wall you had to go through if you wanted to put your hands on her friend. Pax moved a half step forward and then stopped because he was learning, which looked like hesitation but was the bravest thing he could teach himself.\n\nMara hummed the note again. She put her mouth near the seam without touching it and said the vowel Soria had pressed into her like a seed pressed into dirt. The seam made a disappointed sound very few people heard because it was a sound you know only if you have ever been a door with excellent intentions. The ash fell. The men were collected by the city the way a spill is collected by good rags. The bridge, having seen better and worse, pretended it had been an afternoon like any other.\n\nThey did not celebrate. They went home the way you go home after you have refused to let the wrong thing happen in public: with the particular quiet of people who do not want to give the day the satisfaction of not having ruined them. Pax made stew consumption an official requirement. Kestrel made Edda laugh with three new words she had invented on the way over. Caelan stood at the parapet and looked at the place where the ash had tried to spell a second letter and let his face admit to the sort of fear that wakes you and makes you check, at four in the morning, that the doors are all still on the hinges.\n\nMarrowgate breathed in the way big buildings breathe when dusk pushes the heat back into the core. Silas had written a paragraph he did not hate, which made him distrust the paragraph immediately. Lale returned his papers with a note on the top in a handwriting that looked like a good staircase: If you write three more, I can pay you in something other than apples. I am thinking of stamps. Try to keep your sentences from killing anyone. It will make my job with the censors shorter. He read it twice and then put it under the thin pillow because people steal fewer jokes than food, and he would rather be hungry than humorless.\n\nHe felt the seam when the city let out that small disappointed door-sound. He did not know what the sound was and his body learned it anyway. He looked at the wall as if it had learned his name and then politely forgotten it because it had company. He stood without deciding to stand and put his hand to the place the seam had taught him to find with the blind second sight people grow in cages. Across the city a woman pressed a vowel into stone and a vampire told a door to behave. The vibration through his bones ended at a frequency that made the skin at the back of his neck try to climb into his hair. He laughed, not nicely, and immediately apologized to the room without using any words because he had long since learned walls hold grudges.\n\nNight behaved for a few hours. Men in coats stopped working at their desks and looked at their children as if they were borrowed and due back. The pastry shop shooed the last people out with the sort of bedtime stories only sugar can make. Roe fell asleep in her chair with her hand on the mouse and the mouse had the decency not to go waking things up while she wasn\u2019t watching. Soria locked the Baths and then unlocked them because she remembered a girl used the back entrance when she needed to sit in the heat alone and talk herself out of making a glorious mistake. Edda put the bowl back over the paper flower because the devil does not get tired even when you do.\n\nThen the city did what it always does when you believe you have negotiated one more day from it. It asked a price in a different currency. At three a great many windows hummed. Not screaming, not singing, not shattering. Humming, like a throat warming up. Mara sat up in the bed without the part where she wakes and sat and in the sitting was a wakefulness that had nothing to do with sleep or the absence of it. The ring warmed and then cooled as if it had put on a coat and taken it off again in the wrong season. Outside, low and along the river, a small procession of light moved like a thought a man doesn\u2019t want to finish.\n\nCaelan was on the parapet; that was his foolishness and his virtue. He saw the procession and did not call for trumpets. He did not like trumpets for first drafts. He sent the small signal that meant bring me twelve and the kind who know that knees matter as much as shoulders. The procession was too orderly to be ash and too cautious to be Lancers and too quiet to be the city being itself on a night it could get away with it. It looked like men carrying something that had been heavy once and had remembered to be light.\n\nThey brought the thing into the switchyard and put it down with the care you give equipment that saved you once and could break you now if you looked like you didn\u2019t respect it. It was a door in a frame with no wall, and the door was made of glass that had been broken and mended with metal that had learned humility late and was very good at pretending. The men stepped back. They were not ash. They were not officers. They were city workers with good shoulders and the kind of look you acquire when a supervisor tells you to do a thing and you do it but you also decide privately whether that thing belongs to this city or some other you do not consent to.\n\nCaelan put his hand out the way you put your hand out to an animal that has already decided whether it will bite you. The door did not move. Behind him, Jaro said a word that would have made Soria throw a bar of soap at his head. Ran sucked her teeth and then asked, because she was the one with a questions inventory, \u201cWhere did you find a Quietite door you could carry.\u201d\n\nThe man in front with the practical shoulders scratched his nose, which made him human, and said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t. It was leaned up under the bridge. Like somebody had needed to take it out for air.\u201d\n\nThe door hummed. The same hum the windows had. The same hum the seam had admitted but not consented to. Caelan did not call Pax because this had gone past art and into religion and he disliked to be observed while taking sacraments. He did not call Mara because three in the morning belonged to her for sleeping even if the city wanted to make it otherwise. He did not call the Division because once you invite them to your party you will find your guest list has been altered for the rest of your social life. He put his hand on the glass with the insolent humility that had kept him alive longer than many. The glass was not cold and not warm. It tasted in his bones like sugar and ash have a child together and no one wants to talk about whose eyes it got.\n\nHe said, because it had worked once, \u201cNot tonight.\u201d\n\nThe door hummed exactly once and then shut itself, which was a neat trick given it was already closed. The hum ran off into the rails and along the river and into small kitchens where kettles tried to remember if they were alive. Mara lay back down and counted until numbers were not numbers again. Silas sat on the floor with his back to the seam and sang under his breath very badly on purpose because it was a song that did not belong to him and he thought perhaps if he were rude to it, it would go away like a wrong cat.\n\nBy dawn the door was gone. Someone had moved it or it had decided to move itself and the Lancers looked at the empty space and did the particular shoulder motion that meant a thing had happened and they would deal with the next thing instead. Roe woke with a stiff neck and a flood of messages and one note under her mouse, which made her feel homicidal and fond at once. The note said: sugar is not the enemy. It had no signature, and three grains of sugar glued themselves to her thumb as if to prove a point.\n\nAt breakfast, Edda lifted the bowl and the paper flower was still paper. She took it in both hands, went to the sink, and held it over the drain. She looked at her daughter, and her daughter nodded as if in a ritual someone would write down later. Edda tore the paper gently into small pieces and then smaller. She turned on the tap and held the pieces in the water until they were pulp. She did not wash them away. She took the pulp and pressed it flat and set it by the window to dry as a new sheet. \u201cYou do not get to say what you are,\u201d she told it. \u201cI do.\u201d\n\nMara ate bread and stew and sugar off her thumb and watched the world be very brave in small ways. She had a meeting at ten with a woman whose job was to make men in another building believe there was a budget for art and a ferocity at noon with Pax about where the money would come from if there was not. She had a promise with Caelan for later about south tunnels and the kind of map you do not draw on paper. She had to send Roe a recording of a humming because the engineer wanted to build a fence out of it. She had to write to Kestrel a message that said I will not be brave if brave means being stupid. She had to breathe.\n\nOutside, the billboards had finally changed. They did not have the right face up yet\u2014the city is always late to its own party\u2014but they had stopped pretending nothing had happened. The Gate towers did their quiet advertisement. The pigeons tilted their heads like old men remembering a joke. The river carried on. Somewhere under it, a girl with sticky fingers counted sugar grains like notes. Somewhere in a building with a seam, a man wrote three more paragraphs and did not write the boy\u2019s name because he had written it enough for one life. Somewhere on a parapet, a vampire lord looked at a place where a door had been and rolled his shoulders and felt ancient and, against his will, interested.\n\nAnd somewhere in a bath where the mural\u2019s women had new water on their hair, Soria wrote a line on the wall with steam that said, in a hand the city used to pick locks, If you are going to ruin yourself, do it to a rhythm that makes a decent story. Then the water ran and the steam blurred it and the line went into the tile, which is where the city keeps the advice it refuses to frame.Chapter 8\n\nThe budget woman had a smile like a stapler and a wall of framed certificates that tried to convince you she had been born at a desk and had never known the indignity of a kitchen towel. She wore her hair in the kind of bun mothers save for funerals and for days when their daughters say they want to learn to ride other people\u2019s motorcycles. Her office window faced a brick wall because no one trusted cultural funding to survive a view. She introduced herself as Deputy Comptroller Riane Pell in a tone that made each syllable an invoice and asked Mara to sit without looking at the chair, as if chairs had chosen her long ago and she no longer had to negotiate with them.\n\nPax did not sit because he believed in the psychology of legs and because he liked to make paper-heavy rooms remember a body. He spoke first, not to antagonize but to put a layer of plausible charm over the fact that his mere arrival made her budget sheets itch. He laid out the arithmetic the way a man tells you a story with the fair parts in it. Charter Song broadcast. Training morale. The small measurable reductions in injury during patrols when men marched with something to hum under their teeth instead of the tired version of themselves. The tiny uptick in bread sales in the northern quarter at dawn which meant bakers were confident enough to bake extra and people had decided to mix yeast with hope, not scarcity.\n\nDeputy Pell listened with her eyes on a point beyond Pax\u2019s shoulder, which was where she kept a picture of her grandmother in a hat you only wore when there were parades. She let him free-climb the side of her building without a rope and then gave him nothing but a handkerchief. Grants were closed for the quarter. Emergency disbursement required an Event Code number. In-kind support could be offered if they registered the ring as an asset under City Holdings. The phrase in-kind tasted like paper dipped in broth and called a meal. She said it with a clean mouth anyway.\n\nMara had expected to be bored and then to be angry in a small, elegant way that carried no calories. She found herself instead watching the woman\u2019s hands. They were older than the hair and younger than the mouth and they hold a pen like a wand someone had told her was a sword before she learned what swords are for. She thought of all the ways women learned to negotiate with men who came asking for money to make noise and how sometimes the cheapest thing you could spend was affection. She did not spend it. She explained instead that if the city decided to hold the ring in a room with inventory numbers on pegs, then the city could keep the keys and she would go back to singing in kitchens with the taps yelling, and the Night Lancers could march to the sound of their own boots, which was a fine beat for a funeral.\n\nDeputy Pell\u2019s stapler-smile flickered, which was not victory but a movement some women make when another woman says No in public and the room does not fall down. She asked how much, then, if money could be convinced to wear a dress and meet them in a hallway for five minutes. Roe had given Pax numbers written in two inks, one that said truth and one that said lie for the Lord Governor. Pax gave the truth and cut off the last digit because he intended to get it back in favors and hardware. Deputy Pell wrote a figure down and Mara watched the ink turn into a kind of altar. The woman had a budget for clean water and broken windows and paying the six men who wrote speeches and the two women who made those speeches into sentences someone could keep in their mouths. Somewhere she had found a pocket where you keep money for the kind of days that shake your hand and the bone under your hand at once. She opened it enough to be insulting if you were greedy or a blessing if you had their sense of humor.\n\nWhen they left, Pax kissed the air near the Deputy\u2019s temple as if to say we have both survived worse and I will not tell if you do not. On the steps in the sun, he leaned against a column like a man who had fallen in love with architecture and knew better. He told Mara that he had once thought money could be sung into existence and learned it could only be conned, cajoled, borrowed, and wedged under doors until the door couldn\u2019t close on you without admitting its bad manners. He asked her if she could bear to sing again by nightfall if someone else\u2019s bad manners insisted we must. She said she would eat stew first and then perhaps set a small fire in the bath to keep her courage hot. He promised stew, bath, courage, fire, and then gave her the kind of smile he hid from crowds because it made them forgiving and forgiveness was a commodity the city refused to trade honestly.\n\nThe south tunnels were a temperature you usually only found inside rivers and behind old church doors. Caelan met them where the rail dipped and was forced to confess it had never been properly level. He wore his crest without polish and had a smear of something on his sleeve that could have been oil or old blood and which he had not had time to decide on in a way he approved. Ran went ahead like a thought you had on purpose; Jaro brought up the rear like the line at a bakery after rain. Mara felt the ring like a dog that refuses to heel and also refuses to run away. She hummed Roe\u2019s seam-note under her breath because sometimes warding is rehearsing not to scream.\n\nThe sugar was not a dust now. It was a logic. Somebody had arranged bright grains along the line of old runes that hadn\u2019t been pressed by a foot in a generation. The pattern didn\u2019t match the book the Division printed and issued to warders in a package with a brass whistle and an oath you were meant to revise as needed. It matched something else, something the room liked and had been embarrassed about remembering. The ash had set in little hairline patches where the sugar stuck rather than melted, as if it had decided it wanted to touch sweetness and did not know how to behave on a first meeting.\n\nA girl sat twelve yards ahead on a crate that had once held apples and now held a chemistry of items the city would not list under ingredients. She had a sack of sugar tied at three points so that any thief who cut it would split it into three petty disappointments. She had a tin of salt, a glass jar of borrowed honey sealed with wax like a promise someone made in a kitchen with witnesses, and a box of hard candy stolen from a hospital cart or gifted by a nurse with a look that said keep your mouth shut when you enjoy this. Her hair was tied with a ribbon that had been string in its past life and would be a handle in its next. She looked at Mara and Caelan the way gulls look at storms and did not move. It took Mara a too-long second to realize why the girl\u2019s face carried the kind of stillness people try to cultivate in meditation and achieve once at most, usually in a disaster. The stillness was not composure. It was the habit of someone who had not been spoken to often enough to get good at performing speech for other people\u2019s comfort.\n\nKestrel, who had insisted on coming because she had made an appointment with her own regret to meet at the end of the day and did not intend to be late, stopped just behind Mara and took the exact measure of the sugar in one glance because women like her grew up measuring grams with their eyes and deciding if you could get away with stealing one. She swallowed something that might have been the impulse to be the first to speak.\n\nCaelan did it for all of them and took his gloves off first because he was not stupid enough to reach for a child with his hands dressed for war. He tilted his head and let his mouth be less severe. He asked, in a voice a dog would bring a shoe to, \u201cIs this your work.\u201d\n\nThe girl looked at the ash like it had offered her a ride and she had declined. She did not nod and did not shake her head, because koans are fine at noon and useless in tunnels. She took a hard candy from the box, unwrapped it with fingers that did not tremble and held it out to Caelan as if to say you might not be allowed this, and I will enjoy seeing if you refuse. He put out his hand and she walked the steps between crate and angle of his wrist like someone who had learned to count to keep from drowning. She placed the candy in his palm with a precision that made you want to apologize for ever having been clumsy. He put it on his tongue without looking down, because he understood rites he had not invented.\n\nMara tried to find where the room\u2019s hum lay without asking it to hum for her. Roe\u2019s note tucked itself against her palate on instinct. The girl\u2019s eyes moved; there was a river in them and also a city and neither felt proprietary about which parts belonged to whom. She took the tin of salt and let two grains fall onto the sugar diagram as if letting birds out of a pocket. The ash lifted very slightly, a contented animal repositioning. The girl smiled once, quick as a coin in a magician\u2019s hand and as unhelpful to anyone trying to make a lesson of it.\n\n\u201cWhat are we calling you,\u201d Kestrel asked, because names are knives and you hand people the handles you mean them to hold.\n\nThe girl put her finger through the ribbon at her wrist and pulled it tighter like a tourniquet made from sentiment. Her mouth shaped two sounds without letting sound out. She showed them to Mara the way you show someone a paper airplane right before you throw it. The shape of those mouth-movements mattered more than any letters that might get written. They were the vowels you make when you taste something you have never tasted that might be poisonous and you decide to finish anyway. Mara nodded as if she had been told, and repeated the shape, quieter. \u201cAnise,\u201d she said, and the girl\u2019s mouth moved again in a way that admitted this was approximate and adequate and for the moment enough.\n\nCaelan finished the candy and did not flinch at the generosity of a child who lives under a bridge giving a vampire sugar. He asked her with a care a man uses for dynamite and orphanages, \u201cAnise, does the ash write back if you feed it. Do you teach it letters.\u201d\n\nAnise tilted her head half-over and you could imagine her once being told not to spill by a woman who was still alive then and did not use a kind voice for instructions. She held out her hand and asked for Mara\u2019s with a glance that did not seek permission so much as to confirm a ritual. Mara stepped forward because the absence of fear is not a virtue, but refusing to perform it can be. Anise took Mara\u2019s ring-hand in both of hers and turned it, palm up, with a delicacy that made the ring feel shy. She blew on the metal once like cooling a spoon. She touched the ash line with the tip of her smallest finger and then touched the ring and then touched her tongue, which was either how she called a god or how she proved to herself that they are not always bright. The ash lifted again, less a word than a breath that had been waiting to speak since before the Charter had been a set of clauses and not a song.\n\n\u201cIt knows to knock,\u201d Mara said, and Anise\u2019s mouth made the shadow of a yes that didn\u2019t want the work of being a yes. Roe\u2019s note held the seam quiet this time the way a hand on the back of a child\u2019s neck says don\u2019t. Anise scattered three tiny cubes from the honey jar, sugar turned glass by a stove and a patience that had learned its edges burning itself. The ash made an O. Then a line. Then a lopsided spiral that made Kestrel whisper a profanity you only say when you realize the geometry you need is going to make your life longer and your sleep shorter.\n\n\u201cThe old script,\u201d Caelan said under his breath, and it sounded like a man reciting a catechism he pretended not to remember in case his mother were listening. \u201cNot the letter for door. The letter for threshold.\u201d\n\n\u201cDifference,\u201d said Ran, who had a family that had never in its history let a distinction die of neglect. \u201cA door belongs to the room. A threshold belongs to the house. You can break a door. You have to bribe a threshold.\u201d\n\nAnise touched Mara\u2019s wrist again, quick, like please don\u2019t look at this part in front of him. She made a motion with her head that could have meant leave or stay or bring me up where the air remembers the sky. Mara looked at Caelan and then at Kestrel and then at the ash and made a decision you could not revise once you made it. She nodded and said to Anise, \u201cWe\u2019ll go up. Your choice of stairs. Then you can teach me if I am to sing so the threshold decides it would like me enough to not tell its friends later that I was rude.\u201d\n\nThey found the easiest rung-ladder and took it like a prayer you don\u2019t believe but rattles along the inside of your teeth anyway. The street above was the kind with four languages on the signage and washing hung like flags that meant we have survived and intend to continue. The river smell argued with frying and both lost. Anise squinted once, which was a thing she did not do underground, and then put a hand in Kestrel\u2019s coat pocket without asking and came up with a piece of chalk Kestrel had not been aware of carrying because the city slips you tools when it wants to see what you will build. Anise wrote on the pavement a shape that would not have meant anything to a person from a place that had never heard what Quietites told themselves about stones. It looked like a house that had reconsidered and become a hand. It looked like a set of teeth that had not decided whether to smile.\n\nThree children stopped mid-chase and watched her write as if a cart had overturned and spilled sugar in front of them. A woman with her wrists deep in dough at a ground-floor window leaned out with her elbows, a childhood she hadn\u2019t realized she remembered appearing on her face and staying there without her permission. Pax, who had managed to arrive in spite of three mid-level executives with titles like Liaison attempting to intercept him so they could say they were useful to history by keeping it from being itself, kept his body where it looked theatrical to his enemies and supportive to his friends. The chalk made a sound like a small door opening in rooms where doors are only allowed to be decorative.\n\nAnise finished the shape and put her fingertip to her tongue again and grinned for real, evil and childish and proud. All it did was lighten the air for one second the way a window lightens when a bird flies past. If you hadn\u2019t been born here you would have missed it. If you had, you would remember it the way you remember that one day when you were six and someone you love laughed so loud you forgot to pretend to be shy.\n\n\u201cShow me what to sing at thresholds,\u201d Mara said, and Anise shook her head and pointed at Mara\u2019s mouth and then at her own and then at the chalk, which even Pax understood, which was that there are songs you write with breath and songs you write with your feet on stones. Anise took Mara\u2019s hand and placed it on the drawn threshold and pressed until Mara could feel the grit come up into her palm like words that had not been spoken because no one had the right last night. Mara listened. The listening took a piece from her. She gave it and did not ask for change. She hummed the vowel Soria had given her and moved it three inches right because Anise tapped her wrist and you do what you\u2019re told when a child who knows more than you do tells you to.\n\nThe chalk line did not glow because good magic in this city has terrible taste and refuses to make itself easy. It steadied. It felt like a floor deciding now would be an excellent time to hold.\n\nIn Annotations, Aron Tull sat at his desk and rolled a stamp across a bill of lading the way men smoke cigarettes when they are trying not to break a promise they made to themselves that morning. He looked up when the windows hummed, not with surprise but with that tired condescension some men think will keep magic from embarrassing them in front of their receipts. He had a file on his desk that said IVES, MARA\u2014CUSTODY: DECLARATION and he did not touch it because touching things makes them feel invited, and he had learned to be careful which invitations were written in his hands.\n\nIn Marrowgate, Lale set three staplers in a row and told a room full of men with very particular resentments that sentences were not accountable for the men who used them badly. She gave Silas a sheaf of notices that needed writing and a time by which they needed to be written, which is a form of love available in only a few rooms. When the hum came through the building like a thought someone had remembered in the middle of an argument and did not want to admit was a good one, she turned her head toward the wall and let her face do two or three things before she put the face back she used for keeping men from throwing their pens. Silas put his hand on the seam with the matter-of-factness of a man checking a fever in the dark and felt it hold instead of wanting something from him. He kept writing because he had found that you can be more than one man at once if the work is the kind that keeps your hands in one place.\n\nEdda took the pulp of the paper flower from the windowsill where it had dried into a stubborn, unattractive sheet and wrote a list on it, not because lists save the world but because lists on particular paper can be told what to do with their lives. Milk. Soap. Salt. A note to Soria that said Come by and bring me the gossip and I will feed you something you will pretend is not sweet. She folded the paper and did not think about the way her fingers learned a knot as she tied the string around it, a knot she had learned in a street when a man with a commendation pin had come to ask if her husband wanted to help the city be better and had not left until the soup was cold. She put the list in her pocket and went to the market with a determined normality that made three people on the stair rest their backs against the wall and breathe a breath they had not realized they were holding.\n\nBy late afternoon, when the glass buildings begin to believe they are lakes and everyone who has a pride makes the mistake of falling into it, the Division decided to stop pretending not to have noticed anything. They came to the south tunnels with the politeness of men trained to enter rooms without making the dust complain. Their inspector wore a coat with the peculiar, glossy grief of new leather and a badge that had not had time to learn its place on his chest. His name, like his tie, had been chosen by someone else and handed to him. He asked Caelan for access with sentences that had been approved by a lawyer who did not enjoy poetry. Caelan let him finish because he respected tactics and because refusing quickly is sometimes weaker than refusing slowly.\n\n\u201cThe tunnels are not the business of men who write reports unless invited,\u201d Caelan said, very politely, with the slight turn to the last word that made the inspector remember he had a stomach and a memory of being told not to go in water you could not see the bottom of. \u201cConsider this a partial invitation. You may look where we look. You will not touch where we would not.\u201d\n\nThe inspector made a note as if notes could force stone to become a paragraph. He said the word custodian because men in his building had decided to try it on the city\u2019s throat. Pax, who had arrived specifically to prevent that word from getting any more exercise than necessary, laughed softly as if someone had told a joke that should have been better, and said the Charter does not create custodians of voices any more than it creates owners of rivers. He offered the inspector a sweet, because sometimes sugaring a mouth prevents it from saying things badly. The inspector declined because he had eaten today already and would not be bought for less than an ambition.\n\nThey walked together to the place where Anise had taught the ash to mind its manners with sugar and patience and the lack of adult supervision that does real miracles. Anise was gone of course, not because she was afraid but because you do not leave a child in a room once you know which men have learned the way to it, not even a room with ashes trained to draw ovals instead of knives. The inspector knelt and sniffed and immediately tried to make his face not confess how much joy sugar can carry even when it is on stone. He drew a circle with his pen and the ash did not indulge him. Ran coughed into her hand and did not say you are not a woman with a chalk; the ash is not interested in your little thoughts.\n\nIt would have been a manageable day of measured confrontations and narrowly averted errors if the city had not decided to show off in the one way it knows how. At the tail end of evening, when even the river blinks slow, the door appeared again, not under the bridge or in a switchyard but propped with great courtesy against the newly whitewashed wall of a school where girls had learned to slap hands in rhythm that made boys on the other side of the fence wonder what game they were missing. It hummed with an amiable presumption that made the chalk in Mara\u2019s pocket vibrate against her leg. The custodians of that street were women with aprons and men with pennons because the school had a team that threw balls through rings and insulted other teams in songs they had learned from their grandmothers. They gathered at a curious, well-behaved distance around the door and did not touch it because touching things before you have decided whether you\u2019re in love with them is a habit this city tries to beat out of you early.\n\nCaelan came and did not touch it either. He put the back of his hand near the glass as if he might be asking it to be friends without asking for any of its time. The Girls\u2019 Principal, a woman with a neck like a column and a voice you didn\u2019t want to owe late homework to, folded her arms and said, \u201cIf that thing is going to ruin my wall, I will make a song out of its name and be very unkind to it.\u201d Pax promised her money for paint whether the wall needed it or not. The principal said she would take new balls and a better net, because girls need something to throw at where their aim is not suspected.\n\nAnise was there before any of them saw her, which is a trick only certain children learn and usually to their detriment. She touched the chalk line of threshold Mara had drawn that morning on a different street and moved it four finger-widths to the left, which would not have changed anything if the world were a place where precision was not magic. It changed everything there, the little bit that matters. The door\u2019s hum softened. Roe\u2019s note in Mara\u2019s mouth went still and then changed key not because Roe told it to but because the door had decided it would rather be a friend than an opening.\n\n\u201cWhatever is behind it likes us,\u201d Kestrel murmured, not comforted, exactly, by that fact. \u201cLet\u2019s not like it back until it pays rent.\u201d\n\nMara did not sing. She put her palm against the glass because sometimes you cannot expect a city to allow you to be clever when you can be honest. The ring made a small heat. She did not pull her hand away because she had learned last night that sometimes pain is a conversation. \u201cNot tonight,\u201d she said softly, because her throat had learned that sentence from a man who refused to use it lightly, and then, because she was not him and because she had been taught by Soria and because Anise had made a chalk house out of a hand, she added, \u201cBut come talk through the wall. We are tired of monologues. Teach me your question instead of pushing with it.\u201d\n\nNo one who had been to church wanted to write down what happened without cheapening it. The door did not open. The glass did not shatter. The hum took a more interesting shape. Mara felt along it the way you feel along a piano when you are learning which notes your grandmother sang when she did not know anyone was listening. She found there a sweetness that was not sugar and a stubbornness that was not ash. She felt a presence that was not a person and not not a person reading her hand the way women read fortunes and then looking up to see if her face belonged to the hand. It decided three things in a row about her and forgot the first two because the third was more interesting.\n\nSilas woke at the exact moment the hum changed and put his pen down and put his hand against the seam and felt the seam answer in a thickness that did not belong to stone. He spoke without saying anything because words would make a mess. Somewhere in a room without a wall, a door leaned toward the place his voice would be if his throat were allowed to be its own animal, and then leaned back because it had been taught caution by engineers long dead and girls who draw houses with chalk.\n\nThe Division\u2019s inspector wrote the words anomalous artifact in his book as if the book had asked for this sentence as a reward. He asked for the door to be taken into custody. The Girls\u2019 Principal made a sound that meant not while I am here. Pax asked him if he would like to be photographed saying the word custody at an object women and children were standing near with their palms open and their hands honest. Caelan noted how the shadow at the base of the frame lengthened in a way that belonged to a room that did not exist in the world and kept his body between the door and the crowd with a stillness that is what courage looks like before and after banners.\n\nAnise took Mara\u2019s wrist again and guided her hand down a fraction the way you show someone the proper placement of a thread through a needle. Mara let the hand-hum go slack and then taut and then slack again and the door\u2019s humming settled into a stave Roe would later be able to write down in a notation that would make other engineers happy and annoyed. The moment passed the way traffic passes and leaves you alone with the knowledge that all those other lives are going somewhere you can neither prevent nor assist.\n\nAfter, in the hush that always looks like a dignity but is actually relief being too tired to do anything else, Soria arrived carrying a towel and a bag of bread ends that had been soaking in milk and onions since yesterday. She took one look at the number of men whose mouths had opinions and the number of girls who had stopped pretending not to watch and said, as if she were introducing herself to a room full of misbehaving soap, \u201cWe will need bowls. We will need to sit down. We will need to make the street a kitchen now before it becomes a kind of theater worse than any we can write ourselves.\u201d\n\nThey did. The Girls\u2019 Principal had bowls because girls always need them; bread requires them and so does blood. Soria tore the bread and ladled stew and put a bowl in Mara\u2019s hands like a benediction and shoved another at the inspector so that he could not say the word custody with his mouth full. Caelan took one and ate with a soldier\u2019s gratitude, which is to say he ate as if he might not get to again and would not complain if someone interrupted him with a war. Pax ate and licked his thumb and said he could write a law that would codify bread in streets during incidents as a required line item, and Soria told him she would take his tie instead.\n\nWhen it was almost dark, when the ash under the bridge wrote O one more time and then forgot how to finish its second letter because a child somewhere was asleep, when a door had leaned and decided it would come back to find out whether anyone in this city knew how to answer a question without making it a sermon, when the Division had gone home and written a report they tried to convince themselves did not make them frightened in their suits, Mara stood with Anise at the edge of the water and let the river breathe on her face. Anise reached into the sack of sugar and drew a line on the stone so thin even the river pretended it didn\u2019t notice. She put the last hard candy from the box into Mara\u2019s mouth because there are certain favors between girls that do not require signatures. Mara let it break and let the sweetness hurt and then melt because survival is often a series of small decisions to let something dissolve rather than spit it out.\n\n\u201cYou could come home with me,\u201d Mara said softly, knowing what the answer was and saying it anyway because hospitality is not a trick; it is a vow that makes you bigger. Anise shook her head and looked in the direction of the old Baths and then the tunnels and then the bridge as if to say I am home in too many places to choose and your walls will feel narrow and you will think it is about me when it is about your walls. She tapped the ring and then tapped Mara\u2019s forehead in the exact place Edda tapped when she was trying to correct a thought without naming it. She pointed at Kestrel and mimed eyeliner with her thumb and forefinger and made a face that meant you need a wall with a mouth who can talk at men while you look for the seam, and then she laughed without sound and ran because running is still a freedom in this city and some girls refuse to be cured of it.\n\nNight came with its crooked halo and the city pretended for three hours that it was normal to hum through the windows of people who had done nothing to deserve it. The billboards failed again slowly in a way that made them endearing. The Lancers made the kind of jokes they make when the enemy is, for the moment, smarter than they want it to be. The Friends of Music wrote three notes on a wall and rubbed them away with steam so that only the tile remembered. Roe slept and dreamed of cats standing on knobs and refused to tell anyone because she would never be done being mortified by joy. The Lord Governor wrote citizen in a speech and for once did not cross it out. Aron Tull put his head in his hands in a room full of files and said aloud, to no one and to the part of himself that might yet be interesting, \u201cWe do not own doors,\u201d and then wrote it down because words make cowards brave when they believe they can read them later and pretend it was always their idea.\n\nEdda laid two spoons on the table and rolled her eyes when the cat pretended not to want to stand on the chair and then stood anyway with the innate rightness of cats. She tasted the stew and swore under her breath about lava and love. She listened for her daughter\u2019s step and felt the ring from across the room the way you feel thunder coming in your molars when you are old enough to have learned to count between flash and sound. She put a plate of bread under a dishcloth and said to the kitchen, which had never betrayed her and never would, \u201cIf the door wants in, it learns to knock. We are not barbarians.\u201d\n\nSilas wrote his three paragraphs and the joke Lale would like and a line on his own wall, in chalk, that would wash in the morning: I am not a door. He sat with his back to the seam and did not pretend to be brave, which made him more useful than he had been in years to something he could not name. He thought of a girl\u2019s ring tapping his forehead and what would have happened in a corridor if someone had knocked and someone else had answered instead of barging and ending.\n\nOn the parapet Caelan looked at the dark and thought about thresholds and the men he had lost who shouldn\u2019t have had to be brave that night, and the girls who built new vowels out of old chalk, and the way a door had behaved better than most men. He let the night stand next to him and did not ask it for anything and it liked him better for that. He thought that he would tell Mara tomorrow the names of every part of a bridge you never put on a map because men think bridges are simple and thus break them with confidence. He thought he would tell her what you paid and how to make sure you paid only once. Then he stopped thinking for a measured quarter hour and let his body count a rhythm that had nothing to do with drums or boots or the turnstiles in his ribs when he put on armor, and everything to do with the way a city breathes when it has been allowed to believe itself for one day.\n\nMorning would bring another audit, another door, another seam refusing to explain itself like a gallant. It would bring Deputy Pell counting her own mercy and Anise making a line thinner than a thought. It would bring Pax\u2019s tie being stolen and returned, and Soria\u2019s bath a degree too hot on purpose so that girls would remember their edges. It would bring an old boy with a broken shield writing a letter to a song he didn\u2019t like and didn\u2019t know how to live without. It would bring the river doing what rivers do, which is carry you away if you stand still and carry you away if you move. It would bring paint for the school wall because girls always win when paint is involved. It would bring the sovereign made of ash deciding if he could be offended by something that had not been meant for him and trying anyway. It would bring Edda cutting paper she had made into squares and drawing boxes in which to put the words she didn\u2019t intend to write, and then writing them and letting the cat judge her.\n\nFor the moment, there was breath. There was soup. There were doors that did not own you. There was sugar in stone and chalk under a child\u2019s fingernail and a ring behaving, for the space of a sleeping house, like jewelry. There were Lancers waiting to become monsters you could pray for again, which is the city\u2019s oddest blessing, and singers learning to say Not tonight with enough vowels to make it hold. There were bad men with paper flowers on their jackets going home to mirrors that could not be persuaded to become doors. There were good women with pockets with knives and tools and sweets, and their pockets will be written about later by clever men pretending they discovered them, and that will be fine because those men will be very entertained by their own work and the women will still be alive.

Eydolon balanced between its two Declares\u2014the Treaty of Red and the Charter of Sound\u2014while the Night Lancers massed in their marble barracks like patient thunder. People pretended not to notice the vampires striding down the lantern avenues with shields like broken moons. People pretended a lot of things after the Ash Wars. That was how you lived here. Pretend, then nod, then watch. Some of us sang. Or we tried.\n\nMara Ives stood in the queue outside the Glass District\u2019s third-most-important recording house, Hollow Sun, and tried not to scratch at the faded itch on her left hand. The sigil there had never quite gone away, a ghost of warmth beneath her knuckles, as if ink that wasn\u2019t ink had sunk down into the veins. It had showed up when she was seven and had been, at the time, a crescent the colour of tea. Now it was a whisper. She curved her fingers to hide it and felt silly for caring.\n\n\u201cYou going in or not?\u201d said the girl behind her, eyeliner like a storm.\n\nMara shuffled forward. The line jerked, a chorus of nervous laughter rose and fell, someone dropped a bottle cap and it rolled forever. Above them, a billboard flashed: ANTHEMS FOR A NEW EYDOLON. A fang-white smile, a male soloist with hair like lacquer. The tag line: We Don\u2019t Do Ballads, We Do Blood.\n\n\u201cFirst time?\u201d the eyeliner girl asked.\n\n\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Mara lied, even though everything about her was first time. First time in the Glass District at night without her mother. First time in a queue where the front of the room was a panel of A&Rs linked to Night Lancer rotations. First time wearing boots her father would have called impractical for running.\n\nThe girl gave her a once-over. \u201cCute jacket. You look like you don\u2019t want to be here. Always a help.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to be here,\u201d Mara said, and swallowed. Her throat was dry. \u201cI just\u2014my mother says if I get chosen I\u2019ll need to sleep during the day and she can\u2019t stand people sleeping during the day. The light offends her.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes your mother eat soup with a fork too?\u201d said the girl, and then grinned before turning away to scroll a mirror into existence with her thumb. A privacy charm shimmered, then faded.\n\nMara\u2019s phone vibrated. A message from her mother shot to the top of the screen: back by third bell. no deals with men in coats. if they offer food don\u2019t take it unless you watch them cook it. call me if your feet hurt i\u2019ll tell you to sit down. love.\n\nShe typed, i am not five. also my feet are fine. also love.\n\nHer mother\u2019s typing bubble appeared immediately. you\u2019re never not five.\n\nThe queue twitched again and the heavy glass doors breathed. Inside: a cruise ship of a lobby, crisscrossed by gold escalators and humming with the kind of music that eats its own tail. Mara clutched her zippered portfolio, which held a handful of song scraps written in cramped pencil: sticky pop hooks that came to her like embroidery, and two ballads she would never show these people in a million years because they were about grief and aftertaste and the sound of the cellar when the wind was under it. Grief didn\u2019t sell. Eydolon only wanted songs they could chant in unison in the combat tunnels, layered atop the march-steps of the Night Lancers.\n\nShe had come because a friend\u2014okay, the eyeliner girl\u2019s cousin\u2014had said the A&R director himself, Pax Lumen, could grant an audience with the Lancer Lord. She had come because the Charter of Sound had returned to public fashion, and the city wanted a saint with a pop chorus.\n\nAnd she had come because the ring had sung to her in the kitchen two nights ago, and she had spent forty minutes pretending it was the faucet squealing, and then an hour not breathing at all.\n\nThat ring lay in her pocket, wrapped in a napkin, wrapped in superstition. It was the wrong colour for silver, the wrong weight for glass. Her mother had called it a tourist trinket when it arrived in the post, no sender, no note. Mara had snorted and put it in a drawer. Then the crows knew her name, and every time she walked under the viaduct the pigeons paused.\n\nThe line burbled forward. The guard at the door took her name like a thief. Inside, the chill of money. The lobby wall shimmered with a slow loop of Night Lancers training in the rain, gear spinning, swords collapsing into baton-like rods. A tagline scrolled beneath: WE WERE MONSTERS. NOW WE\u2019RE YOURS.\n\nA man folded himself from a couch nearby, lifting a scarf. He looked like a story about youth written by someone who\u2019d never been young. A scar chiseled his cheekbone.\n\n\u201cPax Lumen,\u201d said the eyeliner girl under her breath, as if spitting out a fruit seed. \u201cCareful\u2014he with the bright teeth.\u201d\n\nPax scanned the room like a lighthouse. He always knew when someone was pretending. His gaze snagged on Mara and held, like a thumb on a string.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d he said. \u201cMara Ives?\u201d\n\nShe nodded. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\nHe winced. \u201cDon\u2019t do that to me. I\u2019m not the one with gloves. Come upstairs. I\u2019ve got ten minutes before the Command Council calls me for another lecture on tone.\u201d\n\nShe could feel every eye in the lobby snap to her back as she followed. There were whispers, the word ring, she thought she heard. Or she thought she hoped someone had finally said it out loud so it wasn\u2019t just hers to carry, a foolish thing and a dangerous thing both. Pax moved like a man who never worried about what his back looked like to anybody.\n\nHe took her through a hallway of dark wood and colder music, past doors that breathed sound, past a wall of framed gold discs and silver helmets. He opened a door at the end with a palm and ushered her into a chamber that felt like a deep-bellied instrument. A low table. A couch that tried to be seductive. Floor-to-ceiling windows showing the war barracks across the river, their steady lights.\n\n\u201cYou know why I pulled you,\u201d Pax said, and didn\u2019t make it a question.\n\nMara shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re honest. That makes this briefly easier.\u201d Pax leaned his elbows on his knees. He had a dimple and the tired eyes of a man who has held too many funerals. \u201cTell me about the song in your kitchen.\u201d\n\nMara closed her eyes because embarrassment was easier to manage in the dark. She folded her hands together, thumb over thumb, as if praying. \u201cThere was a\u2026tone. Not a melody, not at first. A hum, only it wasn\u2019t coming from anywhere. It was\u2026being wavelengths, you know? It\u2019s not a good explanation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect explanation,\u201d Pax said, and his voice was a little softer. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told myself it was a pipe. And then\u2014\u201d She groped for the right stupidity. \u201cI put on water to boil. I touched the ring. Just to, I don\u2019t know. Test it and get it over with. It burned. But not like burning. Like cold. Like I could see my hands light up without them really doing it.\u201d Mara opened her eyes. \u201cDo you think\u2014my mother says there are devices for that. Prank rings.\u201d\n\nPax laughed, and it was like an engine misfiring. \u201cSure, and sometimes the moon is a paper lantern hung by a kindly God so the children won\u2019t be scared. Do you have it?\u201d\n\nMara hesitated. \u201cWhat happens if I do?\u201d\n\nPax shrugged. \u201cThen I perhaps offer you a job. And someone else in a different building has an easier time sleeping because they know the Charter is not a relic. And eventually, if you consent, the vampires swing their batons just a little cleaner because the city\u2019s song is a live wire again instead of a museum piece.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy consent?\u201d she said, too sharp.\n\nHis smile flicked. \u201cThat part is real. There are, however, civic urgencies. The Lancers can\u2019t compel a cantor. Not anymore. The wars ruined that sort of convenience in us. But the ring\u2014and I suspect you know this even if you don\u2019t know how you know\u2014likes to be used. It doesn\u2019t enjoy drawers.\u201d\n\nSlowly, as if she were negotiating with a wild animal, Mara pulled the napkin bundle from her pocket and set it on the table. Pax didn\u2019t reach for it. He waited. The napkin\u2019s threads trembled under her fingers. She unwound it. The ring lay like a small planet on the cloth: pale metal with flecks of something like ash beneath its translucent surface, a lens with a darkness at the center, as if it had been made to see through time to water and ruin.\n\nPax\u2019s mouth pressed thin. \u201cI thought it would be ugly,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone always says it was the most beautiful thing they\u2019ve ever held, because that\u2019s the only way they can justify what it asks. But I think\u2014I think honesty might be the new glamour.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not mine,\u201d Mara said quickly. \u201cIt just arrived. No one told me. I only, I haven\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\nHe held up a hand. \u201cThe ring is nobody\u2019s. It chooses a throat and a heart. The old stories say it was forged in the last days of the Quietites by a woman who promised that sound could shape a city if it were honest and ungentle enough. The Night Lancers of Oris have always listened for it. But the ring goes where it goes. It found you. It passed through hands to find you. That isn\u2019t theft. It\u2019s how fate misbehaves.\u201d\n\nFate misbehaves, she thought, and then\u2014\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask my age.\u201d\n\nPax blinked. \u201cI read your file. You turned twenty last winter. Your mother made a pistachio-cheery cake; I am jealous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean\u2014\u201d She flushed. It was ridiculous. \u201cThere are rumours. That the ring requires\u2026purity.\u201d\n\nHe looked at her as if she were telling him he was a fish. \u201cIgnorance is purity,\u201d he said. \u201cNot stupid, mind you. Untethered. Uncontext. The ring needs a throat that hasn\u2019t been taught to steady itself for convenience. People think virginal means flesh. It\u2019s not that. It\u2019s an unused vow. It\u2019s a person who hasn\u2019t yet promised away their voice. You\u2019ve never signed a contract, not even at the open mic level. You\u2019ve never bent yourself to suit a room, I can hear it when you speak. There are edges. The ring likes edges.\u201d\n\nMara exhaled and felt a little dizzy. \u201cSo it\u2019s not\u2014that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot that,\u201d he said, his tone rueful. \u201cThough I cannot stop a city from making up stories to entertain itself.\u201d\n\nHe slid the ring closer to her with one knuckle. She didn\u2019t pick it up. She wasn\u2019t sure whether she wanted to leave the room or throw the windows open and scream. The weight in the air was heavy with potential and the memory of rain.\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d Pax said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do this carefully. There will be contracts but they will not own you. The Lancers will take your measure but they will not taste you. The city will press itself against your face but you may say no. The Charter of Sound is clear, despite what the old men on the Council think. You release one song. Just one. A pop song. It\u2019s a rite, it\u2019s a\u2014call it a broadcast. It resonates through the wards. We need it to wake the Gates. And after that you decide if you\u2019re a singer or if you\u2019re just a particular miracle, once.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow much time do I have?\u201d Her voice trembled. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014my mother will make onion soup. She\u2019ll expect me at the table.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen to you,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThe sound of a city that has not yet got hold of you. Time\u2014we have none. Or we have hours. There is a reconnaissance report at dusk. The Ash Sovereign is stirring again. The Lancers will march before dawn if they must. Your song could tilt the night. No pressure. Tea after. Onion soup before morning if you insist.\u201d\n\nHe sat back and the room exhaled with him. Mara looked at the ring and saw\u2014not a future, no, but a hundred half-futures. All of them had music in them, and in some of them she was free at the end. In others she wasn\u2019t. Her stomach did something unwise.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. Then, again, like an oath. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nIn Marrowgate Prison, in a cell that had seen five names burn into the door and fade, a man wrote a sentence, crossed it out, and wrote it again. The sentence was about a woman who had never been born. He called her by names that tasted like the river in winter. He was a killer if you asked the city and also if you asked the ledger. There was very little to argue about. His name was Silas Brune and he had made a choice twelve years ago that made the world narrower. There had been a boy and a corridor and a blade that fit a hand that seemed too ready. The story in the papers had been efficient. The story in his head never shut up.\n\nSilas wrote: In another life I make masks instead of knives. In another life the city of Eydolon is all round windows and red clay and you can plant lavender on the roofs. In another life there are no Night Lancers because there is no night.\n\nHe stopped and laughed, and the laugh wasn\u2019t a nice thing. It shook out of him like a cough. The guard on the far end of the tier glanced up and then down again. Silas dipped his pen. The prison library had given him four sheets of real paper for the week, which was a kindness they told him he was wasting. He wasted them anyway. He thought about the girl he had seen once at the edge of a crowd when they brought the vampires back from the southern gates with broken shields: she had a look that made your hunger stop. Not pity. Not worship. He thought maybe if he wrote her, the alternative would write itself, and in that other city he did not make a corridor dim with the end of someone.\n\nHe wrote: In this alternative, there is a ring made of a window that was shattered without sound. It makes songs. You think you cannot imagine that? I cannot imagine much else anymore.\n\nThe paper received it, sallow and patient. He held the pen poised. He liked to think he could make a different world if he wrote fast enough. He liked to think he had been in jail all along, even before the cell. Inside the sentence. Inside the knife. Writing the story of a life he didn\u2019t get to live. A man must build a room and live in it when the city refuses one.\n\nHe closed his eyes and saw a kitchen. He didn\u2019t know why. He saw a young woman with a beautiful ignorance and a napkin she wouldn\u2019t unwrap at first. He wrote her singing, though he had never heard her voice.\n\nThe Night Lancers rode past Hollow Sun at dusk as Mara stood in front of the studio microphone and tried not to vomit. The glass room was a cathedral. The boards under her boots had been polished by the fear of a hundred voices. Pax Lumen stood in the booth with two techs, an old witch of a sound engineer named Roe, and a vampire with eyes like a paper cut.\n\nThe vampire wore his crest over a simple black shirt: a narrow shield with an iron tree. He looked like a man who lost his temper and then wrote apology notes in calligraphy. He said his name was Caelan Varro, in a voice like metal singing.\n\n\u201cThe Lord of the Night Lancers,\u201d Pax had said when they shook hands, as if she\u2019d wandered into a fable with the wrong shoes on.\n\nCaelan Varro did not overstare her. He had the discipline of a man who believed that restraint could hold a city together. He waited. He did not smile because smiling at a girl when you are a vampire carries a thousand wrong meanings and he wasn\u2019t interested in any of them.\n\n\u201cDo you hum?\u201d Roe asked. \u201cBefore you sing? Some singers do, some don\u2019t. Some pray.\u201d\n\n\u201cI count,\u201d Mara said. \u201cBut quietly.\u201d\n\n\u201cCount then,\u201d Roe said, turning a dial. \u201cCount us a road to walk you down.\u201d\n\nMara counted, lips parted but no sound at first. She counted the way she had as a child, when a storm broke the sky and she had to pretend that numbers were stones, reliable and breathable. She counted to seven, because seven was where you could stop if you had to and say you were only tuning and not failing.\n\nPax pressed the talk-back button. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready. Remember, it doesn\u2019t have to be good. It has to be true. Pop is just truth with a beat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the same thing,\u201d Roe said grumpily, and turned another dial.\n\nMara looked at the ring on her finger for the first time as something owned. It didn\u2019t fit so much as adapt, subtly adjusting in minuscule sighs. She swallowed. She lifted her hands because something in her wanted to summon or push away or both. She wanted her mother, who would stand next to her and put a palm on her back and say, This is going to hurt but it\u2019s going to be ours.\n\nAcross the glass, Caelan Varro watched her with a tactical attention that should have been terrifying and wasn\u2019t. There was something in it that recognized her, as if he had been waiting at different doors his whole long life and here was the one with someone behind it.\n\nShe sang a single note first, and it broke.\n\nShe laughed, and the laugh sounded like chalk down a slate. It startled her. She tried again. The second note found a place to sit.\n\n\u201cAgain,\u201d Pax said gently.\n\nShe let the ring warm. She thought of the kitchen and the faucet yelling. She thought of the pigeons listening. She thought of the city\u2019s teeth. She thought of what it meant to not promise yourself away yet. She opened her mouth and a melody came that wasn\u2019t careful. It jittered, it hopped, it refused to be elegant. But the words fell into it like stones into a steady river, splashing, making rings.\n\n\u201cI am a wire,\u201d she sang, and the line surprised her. \u201cI am a voice on fire. You don\u2019t know my name yet, but you will by the morning light\u2014\u201d\n\nHer boots found the beat because Roe found it first and laid it down under her, a thump like a door opening. Pax held up a hand and the tech muttered \u201cLive,\u201d and the red light went on that meant the city could be invited if you wanted. We do this as a private rite first, Pax had said, and if it holds, we send it through the Gate towers, we feed it to the rails. The ring would decide too. That was the part that was both fair and not.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a blade not drawn yet, I\u2019m a vow you haven\u2019t heard,\u201d said the next line, and she wanted to argue with herself about being melodramatic but the melody knocked all argument down. \u201cI won\u2019t be quiet, no, I won\u2019t be\u2014quiet you\u2014quiet you\u2014\u201d\n\nThe ring threw sparks on the inside of her knuckles. It showed her the city\u2019s map flipped inside out. It showed her the river walking. The air in the studio thickened with math.\n\nIn the booth, Roe swore in a useful way and pulled two channels down. Pax was grinning now, not in triumph but in relief so honest it stung to see. Caelan Varro inclined his head, and the small movement had the weight of a vow.\n\n\u201cKeep it dirty,\u201d Roe said into the talk-back. \u201cDon\u2019t polish. Pop hates clean. Pop wants the thing that almost fell out of your mouth.\u201d\n\nMara nodded, a small soundless yes. She did not think the words. She let the drum do the thinking. She let herself say it like a dare to every corridor she had ever walked without looking up.\n\n\u201cI am the ring and I am the finger,\u201d she sang, and Pax twitched because he had wanted to skip that, ancient and on the nose and maybe wrong. But the ring wanted it and she wanted it and the two of them together were not interested in a marketing plan.\n\n\u201cIf you touch me you\u2019ll remember,\u201d she sang, and then it went sideways into light. The chord she chose should not have fit. It slid off the beat like a glass on a wet table. And then it found a groove that had been waiting under the city for years, the one that made people breathe on the offbeat. It was a pop song, glitzy and shameless, and the power in it didn\u2019t come from shame or red hunger. It came from the audacity of saying: we are here, we are ridiculous and venomous and brave, we are going to dance while we strap on armor.\n\nPax hit the button that said Send. It was small and he had sworn he would wait. But the room felt bigger now than a room. The walls were more perforation than wall. The city wanted the song as much as the song wanted the city. He pressed and the lightning went forth.\n\nIn Marrowgate, Silas Brune heard the hum through stone. It tickled his ear and made his pen skip. He sat up, slow, like a dog in a new house. He had heard a thousand sounds in that prison, water dividing itself, the whisper of a rat designing a universe, the long rope of scar tissue that was a man\u2019s snore. He had never heard this. It was like someone plucked a thread that ran through him twenty miles away.\n\nHe wrote: In another life, I do not kill him. In another life, I hear this song earlier.\n\nHe went to the bars and pressed his forehead to the cold. The guard looked up and then looked away. There was the tiniest smile trying its foolish luck at the corner of Silas\u2019s mouth. He let it. He wasn\u2019t sure whether it was his.\n\nIn Eydolon, the Gate towers drank the song. Music bloomed along the rails, ran down into the tunnels, bounced off the shields at the training grounds, slipped into the pockets of civilians like a charm slipped into a hand. People stopped mid-step. In the bakery on Bridge Street, a woman with flour on her knuckles put down the proofing basket and laughed. In the barracks, soldiers looked at each other with the stranded expression of someone remembering how to be happy and not liking the suddenness of it. The Ash flicker along the far walls of the city guttered and steadied. Above the floodgates, the old runes breathed.\n\nCaelan closed his eyes and let the song pass through him. He was old enough to remember the last time a Charter Song had been done properly, before the Councils fractured and the Church lost its mirror. That had been a boy\u2019s voice, as sharp as new gin. This one was a woman\u2019s voice. It got itself dirty. It made a promise it might regret. He liked that. Cities needed regret as much as they needed teeth.\n\nHe opened his eyes and saw Pax looking at him, and something like a conversation passed between them without a word. There would be trouble. There were always rumours when a man like Pax pressed the red button earlier than the men with medals liked. There would be the matter of consent, of the Charter\u2019s clauses. There would be the old wives with their old complaints and the new wolves with their new strategies. There would be, above all, the Ash Sovereign\u2019s answer.\n\nMara sang a last line that wasn\u2019t part of the plan, because there had never been a plan except the ring\u2019s and hers, and then she stopped because it was correct to stop. The final syllable hung like a drop of resin, then hardened.\n\nSilence in the studio was elegant. It did not apologize for itself.\n\nMara took the ring off and put it on the table. Her hands were trembling. She had sweat through the cute jacket. She had never felt more tired or more proud or more terrified.\n\nPax exhaled so gently you could have mistaken it for man trying not to cry. He clicked the button and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be gentle now, and then later I\u2019ll go be un-gentle to the men with chairs. You did it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did a song,\u201d Mara said, dazed. She did not quite yet feel the city hearing her. She felt doorways. She felt the electric after of a kiss she hadn\u2019t had.\n\nRoe came out and hugged her awkwardly from one side. Caelan did not move, which was his hug. Pax did what he always did when he loved someone a little: he arranged a bottle of water three inches closer.\n\n\u201cYou need a statement,\u201d Pax said. \u201cThey will ask why a Charter Song is also a pop song and you will tell them the Charter never said a song had to wear a robe.\u201d\n\nMara laughed, burned out and high. \u201cDo I get to go home after this?\u201d\n\nPax\u2019s smile folded. \u201cYes. For tonight. A car will take you. And a guard.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need\u2014\u201d She stopped when Caelan raised an eyebrow.\n\n\u201cYou did a thing that changes the light in the city,\u201d Caelan said. \u201cYou will take a guard so that fools feel deterred from using the dark to rearrange you.\u201d\n\n\u201cRearrange me,\u201d she repeated, and almost grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s polite.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are very polite when we are about to scare people,\u201d Caelan said, and the corners of his mouth did a peculiar, almost human thing. \u201cI will walk you to the car.\u201d\n\nThe elevator ride down was an elongated breath. Mara looked at the neon of the Glass District smeared on the doors. Her phone was vibrating again. She thought of her mother\u2019s onion soup and almost wept. She thought of Silas Brune and didn\u2019t know why she thought of him, a name that was a news story, a monster behind a headline, a man who lived at the fringe of every cautionary tale in Eydolon. The ring had showed her a corridor for a moment while she sang. It had been darker than any hallway she\u2019d ever been in. There had been a feeling of someone unsaying his life.\n\n\u201cWill it hurt?\u201d she asked without meaning to ask it out loud.\n\nCaelan tilted his head. \u201cWill what?\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing this. Doing that again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, not unkind. \u201cBut that is\u2014life. And the ring does not like liars.\u201d\n\nShe felt stupid tears gather. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be\u2014owned by it. Or by anyone. I don\u2019t want to end up one of those, you know, cautionary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you must be very busy being otherwise,\u201d Caelan said. \u201cThere is not much else to do about being a cautionary tale except refuse to end when the story says you ought to.\u201d\n\nThe elevator opened into the lobby and the world rushed at them. The song had been out for nine minutes and the Glass District was a tongue. People were filming. People were crying. People pretended again and then failed at pretending. Mara felt invisible and too visible simultaneously. A child with red hair stared at her with a concentration that pinned butterflies to boards.\n\nShe almost asked Pax to hold her hand. He would have. But she did not. She walked shoulder to shoulder with a vampire lord instead and it made her feel ridiculous, and strong, and like a rumor in her own bones.\n\nIn Marrowgate, Silas put his hand against the concrete and whispered, \u201cIn another life I hold a thread that is not a throat.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou talking to the wall, Brune?\u201d the guard said, bored more than unkind.\n\n\u201cWriting,\u201d Silas said, and the guard laughed exactly once and then looked like he regretted it.\n\nHe lay down with his arm over his face and tried to dream an alternative where the song had come before the boy in the corridor. He didn\u2019t get there. He got instead a window he couldn\u2019t see out of and the sense of someone speaking on the other side, very close.\n\nAt home in a small apartment that smelled like thyme and laundry, Edda Ives set out two bowls and stirred a pot with a spoon that had belonged to her mother. She had the news on. She had a panicked cat pretending to be indifferent under the table. She felt the song when it passed down the wall. She stopped stirring and put her hand to her chest and said, \u201cOh.\u201d\n\nHer daughter was a woman, yes, and also\u2014still a ridiculous child who had once tried to teach the kettle to purr. Edda hoped the city deserved her for one night. It often did not deserve anything for longer than that.\n\nMara sat in the back of the car and counted again. Seven. She looked at the ring on the seat beside her where she had set it, as if it were a passenger prone to carsickness. Caelan sat across from her like a story told to furniture. Pax was on the phone in the front seat saying, \u201cYes, but listen, it worked. Yes, I know the Charter. I can read. No, I will not tell her to wear white.\u201d\n\nThere was a siren slice somewhere and then quiet again. Eydolon wore the song now like a wet dress, clinging and cold, revealing. Mara wondered if she would be recognized at the market, buying cucumbers, next week. She wondered if any of this would be a market next week.\n\nShe had wanted to be smaller than this. She had wanted to make songs that were silly and made girls put glitter on their cheeks in bathrooms. She had wanted to be the person who knew all the songs but not the person who wrote the ones that moved rivers. She had wanted the ring to be a prank. And yet now that it wasn\u2019t, something inside her uncrossed its arms and said, Fine. Let\u2019s find out who I am if I can\u2019t wriggle out of this.\n\n\u201cDo the Night Lancers like pop?\u201d she said, just to see Caelan\u2019s face.\n\nHe met her joke with a straight answer. \u201cThey like whatever carries them through the nonnegotiable darkness between here and where they must be. Some of them pretend not to. Some of them write letters to the songs they pretend not to like.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you like?\u201d She knew she should stop. She wasn\u2019t going to stop.\n\n\u201cDrums,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd unembarrassed singing. And the silence after a victory that was not expected. And onion soup.\u201d\n\nMara blinked. \u201cI\u2019m starting to like you, and I think that\u2019s a mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are untrustworthy. But we are honest about it, which confuses people.\u201d\n\nThe car turned left where it should have turned right and the driver apologized without being told to. Pax was off the phone now and looking at two devices at once, his hands making the kind of motion that calms tech and inflames men who want to be calm. The city outside the window was its own armour: bridges like rib bones, corners like elbows, the river carrying on.\n\n\u201cYour mother will hate me,\u201d Pax said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll bring you soup,\u201d Mara said. \u201cIt will change your life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a life,\u201d Pax said, which may have been a joke.\n\nShe watched the night. She watched her future walk next to the car like a stranger who kept pace uninvited. She closed her eyes and saw the song. She opened them and saw a woman on a balcony with her hands over her mouth. She saw a group of kids hanging out of a window with their phones held up, the screen glow like secret fires. She saw a man on a step who had chosen not to go inside just yet in case the song asked him to.\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Pax said, \u201cwe do the part where we argue that the Charter is not a museum display. And you do the part where you breathe and try to sleep. And I go to the Tower and tell the Lord Governor that if he uses the word maiden I will bite him.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease do,\u201d Mara said, tired and evil.\n\nThe car pulled up to her building, old brick like bread crust. Caelan stepped out first and looked at the roofline as if roofs told him stories. To her right, a shadow moved in the alley and then decided not to be a problem. The ring sat on the seat between them like an answer nobody had asked yet.\n\n\u201cKeep it,\u201d Caelan said when he saw her look. \u201cDon\u2019t leave it on tables. Rings are famous for getting bored and leaving when you make them wait.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to\u2014I was.\u201d\n\nHe picked the ring up with two fingers. It glinted and his lip curled the tiniest degree, like something that had a taste he didn\u2019t expect. He handed it to her. The metal was warm. It took her back like a cat that wasn\u2019t angry enough to stay gone.\n\n\u201cThank you for the guard deterring fools,\u201d she said, with more sincerity than she had expected to have.\n\nHe bowed, an old-world thing that should have looked ridiculous and didn\u2019t. \u201cWe are very good at frightening fools. It is our most civic denomination.\u201d\n\nThen he left because a vampire lord should not be in your stairwell when you are about to hug your mother. Pax squeezed her shoulder like the man he wasn\u2019t allowed to be in public and said, \u201cSleep, little miracle. The city will still be rude in the morning.\u201d\n\nMara went upstairs. She knocked the three knocks that said I\u2019m not a stranger and I\u2019m not the landlord. Her mother opened the door and then there was soup and a cat and a chair and a short silence like a blanket. Her phone was still vibrating on the table. She put it face down. The world could be loud outside. Inside, there was onion and bread and the two of them not pretending for a minute that any of this was normal.\n\n\u201cMy girl,\u201d Edda said, and used a word that was completely denuded of childishness.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know if I could,\u201d Mara said, and didn\u2019t specify.\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d Edda said, as if that solved anything and maybe it did. She put her hand on Mara\u2019s forehead and then, like a woman casting a spell she had no training for, tapped the ring once with her knuckle. The ring made the tiniest noise, heard only by two women and a cat.\n\nLater, when the building slept and the city wore stranger faces, Mara stood at her window and looked at the river. She touched the pane. She imagined she could see where the magic ran, like veins in a wrist. She thought of a man in a prison writing an alternative life that included her. She thought of vampires as warriors who would be at the bridge at dawn, bearing people\u2019s songs like armour. She thought of promises and of refusing to be rearranged. She thought of being a particular miracle, once.\n\nShe hummed, hardly more than breath. The ring didn\u2019t answer. It had done enough for one day. It lay against her skin and behaved like a piece of jewelry.\n\nAt Marrowgate, Silas dreamed of balconies and laughter and a river unbraiding itself. He woke to the thin light of almost morning and the sound of his own voice saying into the stale air, \u201cIn another life, I choose not to choose the knife.\u201d\n\nFor once, the room was kind enough not to echo him. Outside, the Night Lancers lined up in disciplined geometry. Caelan Varro looked down the rank of his warriors and thought, Our city has a voice again. He did not know yet what price it would be. He only knew that the song had threaded their nights together with a string that would make it harder for them to forget one another in the dark.\n\nIn a world where the vampires were the ones you prayed for when the shadows moved, a girl who had not yet promised away her throat had released a pop song using a magic ring, and the city pretended and then stopped pretending and then danced in place. Somewhere a killer wrote a better life. Somewhere, someone waited for dawn as if dawn were a person they might love. The river carried on. The Gates breathed. The soup cooled. The song replayed whether you wanted it to or not. And above the Glass District, the billboards tried to catch up with what had already happened and failed, slowly, with such human precision it almost made them endearing.",

                              "content": "Morning in Eydolon wore its halo crooked and pretended not to be tired. The river made the sort of noise a person makes when they find out they have to go to work again. Smoke from the bread ovens came up slow and silver, and every cornice wore a little dew like sweat. The city\u2019s billboards were late to the party; they still showed hot faces from last night\u2019s releases, a boy with lacquer hair and a fang-white smile, a drink brand pretending to be a revolution. Between them, the Gate towers did their own kind of advertising: a faint pulse along the old Quietite runes, a beating that made pigeons rotate on their ledges and steeple spiders move their webs three inches left like they knew something about geometry and fate.\n\nCaelan Varro stood at the edge of the east drill field and watched his Lancers go through the first forms. Their boots struck in time to a rhythm the city had given them, and he did not correct that. He let his officers make the small noises that made the discipline hold, that kept men attached to their bodies when they wanted to drift into song and leave their edges behind. He had slept an hour and a half in a chair with a square back that tried to reduce him; it didn\u2019t, and after he woke he felt a little like he had been sanded and then polished with river grit.\n\nHe listened to the reports from the night face him out of other men\u2019s mouths. There had been a disturbance by the Third Gate, a scuffing like a door trying to decide whether to be polite. There had been a gathering in the Glass District that started as happiness and threatened for a twitching moment to become a riot, because joy made people brave as often as it made them fools. One of the western rails had vibrated hard enough that a man on the platform had dropped his coffee and swore an oath to the sort of god who accepted oaths about coffee. The north riverlight flickered once without wind. And someone had nailed a copy of the Charter of Sound to the door of a flower shop with bright pins, as if to say, Remember, this is not yours alone.\n\nHis adjutant, a woman whose hair had gone white on the forward edge first and who wore it cropped to make the most of the white, handed him two pages of paper that had been pressed flat with palm and ring. He took them because he dealt in paper almost as often as he dealt in war, and he read them while his Lancers finished the sequence that put their bodies into the shape of a promise.\n\nThe first paper was a schedule he had no chance of honoring. The second was a summary of the Lord Governor\u2019s feelings about last night in language carefully shaved of profanity. The Lord Governor wanted the word maiden used in three separate statements and had been advised by three separate staffers not to. Caelan laughed to himself, and the laugh was like a small stone skipped across his ribs. He folded the papers, put them into the pocket beneath his crest, and made a mental note to send Pax a message that would begin with a courteous insult and end with a compliment Pax would pretend he was not hungry for.\n\n\u201cLord Varro,\u201d said his quartermaster, appearing the way good quartermasters did, like a necessary thought. \u201cThere\u2019s ash dust on the south parapet. Not blow-in. More like shed.\u201d\n\nCaelan\u2019s mouth made the shape his officers called the hinge, which meant a door in him swung, careful and clean. \u201cShow me,\u201d he said, and walked with her along the edge of the field where the stone wall rose chest-high and held back the long drop to the river flats. The ash dust wasn\u2019t much, a pinch here and there, a smudge like extinguished charcoal where it didn\u2019t belong. It made a small shape if you wanted to see a shape. He wanted to. It looked like fingertips. It looked like someone had held their hands above the parapet and shaken them clean.\n\n\u201cThe Sovereign\u2019s flies?\u201d the quartermaster said. \u201cOr some boy with a pack and a grudge.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet us pretend to be optimistic before we get to be correct,\u201d he said, and sent for a warder who could read ash the way Roe read sound curves. His Lancers beat their boots five more times and then stopped together. The field hung in the pause as if the world would applaud them and then remembered it wasn\u2019t a theater, it was a training ground for a war you had to be inventive enough to survive without becoming the reason it had to be fought again in twenty years.\n\nCaelan dismissed them with a hand and stood a moment longer with the south light on his face. The song was still faint in him. He could find it if he wanted, the way a scar can be found with a fingertip in the dark. He let it go. He would call for it later when he needed men to march across a bridge toward things that were not supposed to exist and did. He had, however, other logistics to wage before noon, including a Council session that would require the strategic placement of patience like caltrops on a road.\n\nIn an apartment in the Old Weavers, where the stairwell smelled like everyone\u2019s lunch and someone\u2019s laundry and you lived your way into other people\u2019s business whether you wanted to or not, Mara Ives woke to the sound of her mother drying the bottoms of bowls with a dishcloth as if bowls scratching the table were a form of original sin. The cat was on her stomach, a weight that suggested loyalty and a refusal to move until bribed. She had slept in the blue-threaded light that belonged to people who had done something too big the day before. Her mouth tasted like the inside of a battery mixed with onion soup and an apology.\n\nShe did not open her eyes immediately. She kept them closed and called the ring slowly into her awareness the way you call a nervous creature out from under a table. It came when it wanted to. It sat, dumb as metal. She exhaled and couldn\u2019t decide if that made her glad or frightened. She did not want to be someone who felt abandoned when magic took a nap.\n\nEdda knocked on her door and did not wait for agreement because sometimes the trick of mothering was not asking, it was knowing. \u201cThere is tea and there is a man on the screen saying you are the death of culture, so things are moving along at a normal rate,\u201d Edda said, and kept her voice as ordinary as broccoli, because panic would only make this worse.\n\nMara opened her eyes to the slow calculus of morning. She sat up and slid the ring off where she had slept with it palmed in case it decided to go wandering. She put it on the windowsill and it made a small noise that may have been glass making space for metal. Her body felt heavier than she was used to being. There was a bruise blooming on her left forearm she did not remember earning, and it looked like a fingerprint left by a thing too cold to be a person.\n\nIn the small kitchen, the morning news had been bullied into public service. The woman reading it wore a mouth line like she had once operated a ferry in a storm. The words under her were a collection of the city\u2019s favorite arguments: pop or sacred, Charter or stunt, harm or help, maiden or not your business. There was a small box with a priest in it, and another small box with a historian who had published a book about the Quietites and was good at behaving like he was born in the wrong century and that was the city\u2019s fault. There were calls queued from men with chain-store shirts and women from the laundry cooperatives who had noticed their machines sing back to them a note lower this morning.\n\nEdda poured her tea with the attention of a surgeon. \u201cPax sent a message at six like he was afraid he would get in trouble if he didn\u2019t tell me where my daughter was. A car will pick you up at ten. He says wear what makes you feel least compromised. He did not explain how you are meant to know what that is.\u201d\n\nMara leaned against the counter with her cup and felt like she had smuggled something back from a country she had been told did not exist. \u201cYou should have been at the studio,\u201d she said, immediate guilt rising like a habit. \u201cI should have asked them to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should have sung the song and come home. Which you did,\u201d Edda said, and tapped the ring with an index finger the way you touch the fur of an animal you suspect might be venomous and also knows it\u2019s very pretty. \u201cI watched you on the replay while you were asleep. The end made me want to swear too loudly for the cat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have an end,\u201d Mara said. \u201cIt just came and then there wasn\u2019t anything else after it, so stopping felt like the only honest thing. I suppose that is art. Or a lapse.\u201d\n\nEdda folded the dishcloth like folding could bring peace to the world. \u201cYou are going to tell men with medals that their medals are on the wrong jackets, eventually. That is not art; that is a personality trait. Eat something so you don\u2019t faint and let them say it was nerves. You will faint when the doctor tells you bad news at sixty-eight and you don\u2019t want me to worry. You will not faint on television.\u201d\n\nMara chewed the bread like a person making a pact. The cat looked up and then put his head back down like fragile men in fragile times everywhere. Her phone vibrated and she picked it up because the habit was stronger than her resolve. Messages jammed themselves into a stream, a messy river of hearts and knives and the sort of anonymous earnestness that smelled weirdly like loneliness. There were four from Kestrel, whose eyeliner could declare a small war, each a different form of profanity that meant I saw you, which was a love letter of its own.\n\nShe sent a reply that was a heart and a thundercloud and a sentence Kestrel would not forgive her for softening. She set the phone back down because it felt like a small animal that might bite her, and she did not have time to be bitten by small animals. She went to the window and looked at the river and thought of how she was supposed to go from here to a building with doors that wanted to close on women like her and call it an accident.\n\nOn the other side of the city, in a place that had learned to be quiet because being loud was disallowed and punished, Silas Brune held a piece of old mortar and drew a circle on the floor with it. The circle wasn\u2019t very good. It had a place that went indented like a soft body under a thumb. He tried again, and the guard on the end of the tier did not tell him to stop because the guard was reading something that pretended to be a magazine and was actually a pamphlet about going south in the spring and growing peppers. Silas had managed to beg another sheet of paper out of the librarian with the soft shoulders and the less soft smile. He had bribed her with a sentence that made her laugh against her will. He wasn\u2019t proud of using his language like that, but he used his hands and his head for worse things; he was economical with his sins when he could be.\n\nThe prison had hummed all night, the way old buildings hum when the pipes have a secret. He had got up twice because the bed had tried to break him into the parts he had tried to avoid thinking about. He had stood at the bars and put his face into the cold and thought of the woman\u2019s voice threaded through the stone like the river got lost in walls. He had not expected music to be a kindness; he was suspicious of kindness under any circumstances. It had not asked him to feel better. It had not forgiven him anything. It had put its arm around his shoulders for three breaths and then gone on to do other work. He respected that sort of love.\n\nThe circle was for a test he had read about in a book someone had smuggled in when he had been a younger man who thought tricks would save him. The book had been confiscated and then thrown back at him because the guard who had opened it had thought the sentences were outside of their job description. Silas closed his eyes and tried to hear one note from the song again. He tried to find the thin thread that had wrapped around his tongue like a wire. He held the pen he had hidden under his mattress and put the tip to the floor and wrote a letter to a woman who did not know his name except in the way a city knows the names of its thieves and its singers.\n\nHe wrote: I do not think you are a miracle. I think you are an accident with exactly the right edges. I think you arrived the way knives arrive in corridors, which is to say someone left a door open and a life went from one room to another.\n\nHe stopped and looked at the sentence and hated himself for the way it assumed he had the right to name her. He wanted to scratch it out and cannot because stone holds what you write on it like a promise. He made the second circle around the first and told himself it was geometry, not superstition. The wall beyond his cell had a seam in it now he could feel with the heel of his hand if he pressed in the right place, a hairline that caught skin like a whisper. He did not intend to dig. He was past intending. He was not past listening.\n\nShortly before ten, the car came for Mara as they had said it would. It had windows that made people look like they were made of a more expensive glass than people generally are. Pax\u2019s driver had the face of a man who had left a war halfway down a hill and would cheerfully drive a car through a wall for the right reasons. Pax was not in the car, which was a relief and a disappointment both. There was a folder on the seat next to her, and the folder contained papers with Pax\u2019s handwriting on them, which looked like a person doing calligraphy while the building burned. There were three talking points in case she needed them. There were eight lines telling her to not read the talking points if she could stand it.\n\nCaelan took the steps up to the Council Tower with a grace that did not belong to a man who had been dead and had been told to walk anyway. The Tower still had the smell of the old Church in it. It did not always acknowledge the difference between men who wore collars because they had saved a city and men who wore collars because they had decided God needed an assistant. He passed under the carved names of those who had drafted the Charter, and he touched two of them out of habit. The third he did not touch because the man had been a genius about sound and a cruel husband, and Caelan tried not to make that sort of compromise before noon.\n\nThe Council chamber had a table that pretended to be a circle and was actually a horseshoe, which was the city in furniture. There were place cards with names and the preference a man had for water with or without lemon. There were microphones like flowers. The Lord Governor sat and did not stand to greet anyone, because it was one of his small pleasures; Caelan did not penalize a man for taking small pleasures, but he kept a ledger of them just in case. Pax was there with a suit jacket his mother would have called impertinent. He had no tie and a pocket square so dark it was almost a laugh about blood.\n\n\u201cI would like to begin with a word we do not often use in this room,\u201d Pax said before anyone else could get their throat around a phrase like public safety. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nThe Lord Governor did not roll his eyes because he had improved his public face in the last year and a half. He made the more subtle move of smoothing his moustache. \u201cWe will dispense with courtesy and go to obligation,\u201d he said, and the clerk\u2019s pencil made a noise like a match striking as if it had independent feelings. \u201cThe Charter of Sound requires consent given in writing and before witnesses before any broadcast intended to awaken the Gates. The singer last night was a young woman with no previous appearance in this chamber and no posted contract on file. You circumvented\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI spoke to her,\u201d Pax said, with his hand flat on the table like he could nail his argument down with it. \u201cI explained the Charter and its protections. She agreed. We recorded her agreement; Roe has the minutes and the time stamp. The Charter is not offended by pop. It is offended by coercion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe city is offended by midnight stunts,\u201d said a man Caelan didn\u2019t particularly care for, whose family owned the rights to most of the city\u2019s night markets and therefore believed himself both a merchant and a poet. \u201cThe city is offended by surprises that make guards call in and wives call out and people stop what they are doing to dance on the kerb. We could have had a panic.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did not,\u201d Caelan said, and allowed his voice to be a little more metal than usual. He preferred to hold tone like a baton rather than swing it, but sometimes it was useful to let the sound show its teeth. \u201cWe had an adjustment. The men and women under my charge yesterday sang at their posts while they did their jobs. Their jobs went well. The ash along the south parapet tells me we made someone across the river think, which is one of my favorite things to make an enemy do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was ash on the parapet?\u201d said the Lord Governor, doing a small acting like he had not known. He had known. \u201cThat should have been sent to the Division.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Division will have their pinch,\u201d Caelan said, and did not smile. \u201cThis is not a meeting about ash. This is a meeting about control. I am here to tell you that sometimes the control you think you hold is the thing that will strangle you. The Charter is alive. It has slept. Last night someone shook it awake. It will snarl if you try to put it in a glass case and admire your reflections upon it.\u201d\n\nPax made a small grateful nonsense noise he probably believed no one heard. Caelan heard everything. He did not turn his head to look at the door when it opened because men who believe themselves to own rooms look at doors. They did not. He could smell her in the hallway before she came in, a sweat that was very clean and very honest, a note of onion and something like metal after rain. The clerk announced her the way clerks do when the room is full and the person in the doorway is the occasion.\n\nMara walked in and her boots made a sound that was not embarrassed. She had put her hair up and then let one piece fall on purpose because she had practiced and then given up and that was the piece that refused her. Her jacket was less cute than last night and more deliberate. She had a small notebook in her hand like a talisman and a look on her face that said she had slept and had not slept, which was the look of every person who had done something their city asked for and then could not decide whether to present a bill.\n\n\u201cThey would like to ask me whether I consent to having consented,\u201d she whispered to Pax when she stood beside him, and he made a small pained parent laugh he would deny until his dying day.\n\n\u201cWe would like to ask you if you understand the role you have thrust yourself into,\u201d the Lord Governor said, and then realized thrust had been a poor choice because the older women on the Council all made the same small face at once. He coughed the kind of cough that means a man has been interrupted by his own vocabulary. \u201cMiss Ives. Thank you for attending. You are very young.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am twenty,\u201d she said, and her voice did not apologize for being twenty. \u201cYou are using words like maiden in my letters. Do you know what it is like to have a city discuss your sexual status before breakfast. I don\u2019t recommend it. I recommend you discuss whether last night helped the Gates breathe and whether I am allowed to decide what to do with my throat.\u201d\n\nThere was a long, delicate silence in which several men moved pens and shuffled papers as if papers might save them from words. Caelan had to restrain an unprofessional noise. He looked down the table and saw two women he had fought beside in the last sick summer hide smiles in their water glasses. The Lord Governor folded his hands as if he could make a church between them.\n\n\u201cWe do not intend to strip you,\u201d he began, and then stopped because he was not that clumsy a man, and yet the word had been standing there waiting and he had walked right into it. \u201cWe do not intend to deprive you of any Charter right. The Charter is the reason the Lancers are yours and not enemies. The Charter restrains us all. The Charter also provides for responsibility. If you wield the Charter ring without the backing of the Choir, you open us to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is the Choir now?\u201d Mara said, and there was no quite successful way for him to say a word like Interim because it would make the room smell of the ruined church on Grave Lane. He did not answer. She put her notebook down so she wouldn\u2019t squeeze it. \u201cThe Choir are women who didn\u2019t want to be told when to sing or what to wear to sing. They left. We wrote new songs in kitchens. The city kept itself from becoming the wrong sort of quiet. I am here as a woman who wants very badly to be small and who can\u2019t be, not now, because someone sent me a ring. My consent is a moving thing. I gave it last night. I am not giving it to you for forever. If I write another song using the Charter, it will be because I have to, not because this room told me it was what nice girls do.\u201d\n\nPax exhaled in a way that was performed for him alone. Caelan took the tenor of the room again and found it had shifted a half step toward honesty and discomfort, which was where things could be done. The Lord Governor adjusted his lemon water and nodded a nod that was both a concession and an investment in later arguments. He glanced down the line at one of his advisors, a thin man whose forefinger had ink under the nail, and the man made a note that would become a policy by afternoon.\n\nThey asked her then the questions they were allowed to ask because they had memorized the Charter\u2019s limits. Did she understand the Gate\u2019s temper, the city\u2019s tendency to vibrate at certain frequencies until people could not hear themselves think and then did dangerous things? Did she have anyone advising her besides Pax, and could Roe be compelled to share the tapes, and did the ring injure her, and had she seen anything while she sang that she interpreted as an omen? She said yes where yes was true and no where no was not untrue. She said Roe was a witch who would eat anyone who tried to compel her and that the tapes were safer with Roe than with any of the men in this room. She said the ring did not injure and also it did, and both were correct. She said she had seen a corridor where a bad choice had been made and that she had no plan to sing in corridors for fun.\n\nThey released her when they realized she was the sort of person whose yeses and nos were not transactions in the way their yeses and nos were. Pax walked her out and then put his back to the closed door and breathed like a man who had come down five flights of stairs too fast. He shook his hands out as if to remove electricity and failed because electricity liked him. He did not hug her because she would have bitten him on instinct.\n\n\u201cYou said what you had to say and you did not give them the parts they wanted,\u201d he said, which was a review and a benediction. \u201cWe have an appearance at noon to explain pop to the sort of person who thinks drums are a conspiracy. Then I will try to stop three newspapers from printing the word virgin in your headline. I will fail at two and win at one because that is the ratio of sin to grace we get in this city.\u201d\n\nMara stood in the corridor and looked at the place where the stone met the wood and thought she could feel a hum that did not belong to buildings and was not hers. It ran along the baseboard like a thin vein. She stepped lightly and it stepped with her for a moment and then hid. \u201cI would like to eat a pastry,\u201d she said. \u201cI would like the pastry to be so sugary it offends someone. I would like to do that before anyone asks me to carry a sword, metaphorical or otherwise.\u201d\n\n\u201cDone,\u201d Pax said, and the relief in his face at a practical request made her want to kick him and pat him on the shoulder at once. \u201cThere is a place with a woman who pretends to hate me and will give you the last perfect thing on the tray if I give her a look that says I remember the war and let her call me names.\u201d\n\nThey went out through the northern doors because the western ones were guarded by people with lenses and Pax had a sense of humor but it did not extend to handing his singer to the people who made their wages out of getting you to say the thing that started the fire. The northern steps were an acceptable small descent into being looked at. A woman with a baby in a sling called, \u201cYou did good,\u201d and then clapped a hand over her mouth as if she had sworn. A man with paint under his nails and the smell of fixative said, \u201cThat chord was illegal,\u201d with the expression of a person who has been waiting his entire life for someone to give him permission to make an error on purpose. A boy with braces yelled her name wrong and looked as if the metal were burning him.\n\nCaelan watched them go from the shade of a column and did not follow. His job this hour was to go to the south parapet and read ash and then to take a dozen Lancers into the tunnels because a scout had heard things he did not like and he was not a man who left dislike alone to behave itself. He sent a single message to Pax that was a warning disguised as a joke: The Division\u2019s eyes have turned foxward. Keep your birds inside. Pax replied with a lightning bolt and a knife and the word soup, because he believed in code as a way to comfort himself.\n\nMarrowgate Prison woke to breakfast like it always did: the sound of trays and the steam that made men think of other kitchens and the sudden loudness of men existing in a space together without the buffers they had in the world. Silas did not get up immediately. He watched the seam in the wall across from him expand a fraction and then stop as if it had changed its mind. He sat up slowly because rushing made the day worse. He put his feet on the floor like they were new and might not trust him yet.\n\nThe guard with the pepper pamphlet came down the tier with his belt jangling like a small bell. He slid the tray into Silas\u2019s cell and did not make a joke about porridge because that had been done for three hundred years too many. \u201cYou get a visitor this afternoon,\u201d he said, as if he were saying a word like shampoo. \u201cDon\u2019t stab him.\u201d\n\nSilas looked up at him and let the silence sit one count longer than comfortable and then asked, \u201cWho?\u201d\n\nThe guard shrugged and failed to make it a movement that did not mean something. \u201cSome woman in a coat with a patch that says she\u2019s a friend of music. Says she\u2019s doing a survey of men who wrote songs when they were young and then made mistakes. I said we didn\u2019t have any of those. She said, \u2018Then I will take a man who used to write letters and forgot how.\u2019 She gave me an apple and it didn\u2019t look poisoned. You should shave. You look like you sawed your face with a spoon.\u201d\n\nSilas did not laugh at the spoon because he had once seen a man open another man with a spoon, and you can only laugh at some things in some rooms and live. He waited until the guard had gone and then he put his hands against the seam again and the seam did not respond because it was morning and the song was not throbbing through the stone the way it had last night. He told himself not to imagine that a woman with a coat was going to bring him a rope made of sound. He told himself he would be polite and not tell her the alternative life he was writing had her room in it. He told himself and did not believe himself because the morning had arrived and with it the small unnatural hope that comes when magic has crossed a city you lived in long enough to think you had mapped.\n\nThe pastry shop was the sort of place you bring secrets and pretend they are crumbs. It had windows with hand lettering and a woman behind the counter with a mouth that could stop a clock. Pax went in like a man entering confession. The woman said his name with the precise weight that suggests you once took a bullet together and also that she believes he owes her five favors. She looked at Mara and made the small noise mothers make when a child is in the room who has done a thing for the house and is now standing there with their hair not quite combed.\n\n\u201cI have nothing left but the things no one else can carry,\u201d the woman said, and lifted a tray where three squares rested with sugar on them like the first snow on a roof. \u201cAlso a doughnut that is having an identity crisis.\u201d\n\nMara chose a square and regretted not being able to choose all of them the way a person regrets not being able to live all their lives. She put the first bite in her mouth and nearly cried because it tasted like butter and sugar and the absence of violence. Pax ate the identity crisis and looked like a man who deserved his fate. The shop was full of people being ordinary at high volume. A girl at the corner table had taken a guitar out and was playing the wrong chords with such determination you had to approve. A boy at the window was drawing a map of the city onto his sleeve with a pen because sometimes you had to carry the place you belonged on your body like a threat.\n\n\u201cI got a letter,\u201d the woman said to Pax, and put her hands on the counter to force him to be serious. \u201cIt says they will audit me. It says I had twenty-two rolls go missing in a week and the City thinks that means I am paying for certain things with bread. I am paying for nothing with bread except my rent and a boy who insists hot chocolate is a human right.\u201d\n\nPax made a face at the word audit the way men made faces in the old days when a priest said confession and meant theater. \u201cYou give the Lancers a tray twice a week when something goes wrong at their training. I pull you out of the audit by afternoon. You plan in case I cannot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have never been without a plan,\u201d she said, and glanced at Mara the way you glance when you are making sure someone eats enough to do what you know they have to do. \u201cDon\u2019t let them tell you you are a thing they own. A room full of men is a room full of wishful thinking. You do the part you can live with. You give the rest to whoever pretends to like suffering and suits.\u201d\n\nOutside, the street had decided that looking was not impolite if you did it with admiration instead of intrusiveness, which would have been flattering if admiration did not have a way of turning to hunger without warning. Kestrel found her outside the pastry shop the way bird dogs find things they have flushed, with her eyeliner like two precise wounds and her grin like a charm twice used and still potent. She grabbed Mara\u2019s wrist and then remembered she was a person and not her scarf and let go.\n\n\u201cYou did it,\u201d Kestrel said, and then shook her head hard enough to upset her balance. \u201cNo. You did a thing no one else can be caught doing. That\u2019s ruder, which I respect more. I heard men trying to decide if they could still like ballads. I told them their grandmothers listened to laments while they repaired roof tiles and they made babies to the sound of rain, so yes.\u201d\n\nMara breathed in Kestrel\u2019s smell of cigarettes she didn\u2019t smoke and perfume she pretended she couldn\u2019t afford. \u201cThe city is being very loud,\u201d she said, and Kestrel bumped her shoulder the way women bump each other when pushing a car out of mud.\n\n\u201cThey are going to eat you and then worship you and then want your skin as wallpaper. That\u2019s the ritual. You are going to have to learn to want things loudly so there\u2019s no room for their wants. I brought you this,\u201d Kestrel said, and shoved a pair of sunglasses at her that looked like they belonged to someone who lived on a balcony. \u201cThey will not help. They will make you feel like they help, which sometimes is the only help anyone can give.\u201d\n\nThey were laughing, the kind of laughing that has claws and helps anyway, when a man stepped away from the shadow of a doorway and smiled with the flexible mouth of a person trained to convince you of nice things and bad things at once. He wore a coat that belonged to the office called Annotations, a coat that said, We like documents and order and we would like to know the details of the life you are living so we can make a better list. He held a white envelope the way you hold bread. He was careful with his eyes; he did not look directly at the ring.\n\n\u201cMiss Ives,\u201d he said, and somehow the way he said it made Pax appear between Mara and the space the man was standing like a very elegant storm. \u201cApologies for the abruptness. My name\u2019s Aron Tull, from Annotations. We\u2019re all very proud. We would like to make certain your documents smile in the correct places. Small thing. A signature on a form that says\u2014officially, you know\u2014that the ring is presently in your custody and that you understanding its chain of provenance is under investigation.\u201d\n\nPax had been built for moments when men came with paper and tried to turn the world into a series of squares they could move around without looking up. He took the envelope like a man accepts a compliment, with half a smile and three teeth. \u201cMy documents will giggle when they see yours,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will bring them to your office after we have taught them manners. Good morning.\u201d\n\nThe man moved as if to insist and then had the rare survival instinct that told him a bad morning could become a very bad morning if he moved his hand in a particular way. He left his card. He walked away the way men walk when they think you are going to watch them. Pax put the envelope into his coat because he never threw anything away until he had read it three times with and without the lights on. He did not tell Mara not to worry because that is a useless sentence.\n\n\u201cMen in coats,\u201d said Kestrel, because some advice you carry with you because your mother was right the first time and you don\u2019t need to improve it. \u201cEdda will cut him to ribbons with a bread knife.\u201d\n\nThere was a tremor underfoot that made all three of them adjust their balance. It was not a subway or a cart. It was not the wind. It was the Gates giving a breath and then holding it. People on the street went quiet the way city people do when the thing that keeps their corners in place reminds them that it can move. Mara felt the ring against her bone though she wasn\u2019t touching it, which was alarming and then embarrassing because it meant she had thought she could leave it on the windowsill and be its boss.\n\nCaelan and a dozen Lancers were already underground by then, not beneath the Gates themselves but beneath the parts of the city the Gates had loved in other lives. The tunnels smelled like drowned metal and stories. Their lights made the sort of small sound lights make when they touch old magic and pretend it is dust. Jaro, a soldier with a laugh that had survived too many things, was to his right, and Ran, who had once taken a vow that she didn\u2019t realize tied her to nine years of being angry and then broke it in a courtyard with rain, was to his left.\n\nThey moved along the curve of a maintenance passage until it opened onto a chamber that had been a place for sorting before the Ash Wars. The Chamber of Numbers had seen the movement of as many people as any cathedral. Caelan told them to hold, because holding could save lives as often as it cost them. He closed his eyes with a soldier\u2019s arrogance and he looked with the kind of looking that had nothing to do with sight. The song had left a residue here. It had dusted the old markings into relief the way a child rubs charcoal over paper to show a coin\u2019s face.\n\nThere was ash, but it wasn\u2019t scattered. It was arranged in a shape that had no reason to be alive and was. It looked like a door when you squinted. It looked like a hand when you didn\u2019t. It looked like someone had tried to teach the ash to speak and had gotten as far as a letter O and then had to run. Caelan stepped closer and the ash formed itself in the smallest shiver that could be written off as your own heart. He put his hand out and stopped before his palm touched empty air. He left it there like a man considering a handshake.\n\n\u201cDo we touch it,\u201d Jaro said, and stood like a man who has decided not to die today if he can help it.\n\n\u201cWe ask it a question first,\u201d Caelan said. He pitched his voice to the tone you use for dogs you trust and children you love and old gods you suspect might have finally improved their tempers. \u201cWho sent you.\u201d\n\nThe ash moved with the delicacy of falling hair. The O became a shape the warders would recognize as a sign from before. It wasn\u2019t a word, not in their alphabet. It was a pressure that made you think of a body leaning against a door. Ran swore and then apologized to a deity she did not believe in because swearing is sometimes a social reflex.\n\n\u201cSomeone is pushing,\u201d Caelan said. \u201cIt is not the Sovereign. He does not knock. He makes holes and calls them entrances.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen who,\u201d Ran said, and got no answer because the city was busy and had not scheduled a moment for that answer to arrive. The ash dropped as if a hand had withdrawn. The chamber returned to being a place where numbers had been sorted. Caelan inhaled and tasted sugar in the air where there should have been rust. He filed that away next to the word Kestrel in his mind because he needed the women in eyeliner to live and keep their secrets and there was only so much space for sugar underground.\n\nMara stood on the steps of a building that would like to have been in a different argument and answered three questions before she was asked. She said the ring did not make her sane or insane. She said she liked drums and ballads and songs that made a street stop spinning. She said she would finish a pastry before she finished a thought if she could manage it. Then she did the thing that was going to make Pax say Please don\u2019t hurt me later. She took the ring out and put it on her finger in front of the cameras and nothing happened for a heartbeat and then, because the world could not help itself, something did.\n\nThe lights on the street flickered in time to the memory of the song and then steadied. The Gates two bridges away inhaled and exhaled like men in a line preparing to step into their night. Edda right then at her kitchen table slapped a hand down over the headlines that tried to enter her house like rude relatives and said, \u201cStop it,\u201d and then laughed at herself because she had just told the city to mind its manners.\n\nIn Marrowgate, Silas\u2019s visitor came in smelling like lavender and dust and the inside of new books. She wore a coat with a patch that did say Friend of Music, which was a polite lie. Silas stood because he believed in theater when there was very little else to believe in. She had a file in her hands and a look in her eyes like she enjoyed finding holes and putting names into them. She set the file down and looked at his circles on the floor and at his face and then at the seam in the wall and he saw the moment she decided to pretend she had not seen anything. He admired that sort of professionalism. It was a hell of a thing to pretend to miss something and then make sure your job remembered you had.\n\n\u201cYou wrote songs once,\u201d she said, and the vowels admitted she had parents who had wanted her to speak like a teacher and a child who had taught her how not to. \u201cLetters after that. We have a program. We take men who are good with sentences and teach them how to put them into places where the city can\u2019t do much damage. Grant writing. Public notices. A pamphlet about teaching kettles to purr.\u201d\n\nSilas looked at her hands and noticed they were too clean for a person who handled files. He wondered if her desk had been invented for her so she could put out her hands to make people think she came from paper. \u201cI killed a boy in a corridor,\u201d he said, and he did not soften it because softening things is lying and this was not a room that wanted lies; it was a room that wanted unpleasantries said with a flat tone so they could be filed.\n\nShe did not flinch the way men flinch. She made a small noise in her throat like a woman who had once cut her hand on a jar and did not tell anyone and got on with the soup. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cThe boy was part of a list I keep. The list is in my head because paper is too kind. You do not get out of jail because you write a pamphlet. Don\u2019t ask. It makes the conversation long and then makes me late to the next conversation. You could write in here. You could make lines other people will read and keep. You could stop writing to a woman you think you can save if you call her in the right tense.\u201d\n\nSilas put his hands on the table and thought if he pressed hard enough his palms would grow roots and he would be a tree with a man\u2019s head and birds would nest in his hair. \u201cI am not writing to save anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cI am writing so there is a version of me somewhere that does not deserve what he has and does not try to make that mean anything.\u201d\n\nShe nodded. She slid a stapled packet across the table, which was the shape of this conversation. He could either staple himself to something or not. There was a line on the second page where he could let words become wages in a place that had none. She reached into her bag and put an apple on the table because apparently this week men in rooms with no fruit got apples. He wanted to make a joke about it but no joke was as funny as living. She said her name was Lale. She did not tell him where she bought the coat patch. He signed, because there are forms of hope that do not embarrass you and this was one.\n\nWhen the second noon had got itself done, and the city had decided it still existed, Mara sat in the back of another car and stared at her hands and tried to decide if they were hers. Pax had a voice left and used it to tell someone that if they wanted to film her mother\u2019s building they should wear nicer shoes. He had a voice left because Roe had given him a throat lozenge that made you feel like a library was opening in your chest. Caelan had sent a message that said simply, south tunnels. Later. Because he had set aside a sliver of a day to tell her something about swords and the parts of a city that refused to be drawn on a map, and because he could smell the other thing coming and wanted not to waste time when time made faces.\n\nThere was a gift waiting when she got upstairs that made Edda say three syllables of an old prayer, which is two syllables and a hand. It was a bouquet of paper flowers, folded with such care it almost made you like their maker, except that when Mara touched the edge of a petal it turned to ash. There was a small card with handwriting too polite. It said: Return the ring to sleep. It said: We will be gentle first.\n\nEdda took the flowers to the sink and ran water over them as if water could outvote ritual, and they did not turn to ash under the tap. They stayed paper and ugly. Mara put her hand on the counter and tried to decide if she was a person who would be frightened now or later. The ring lay where she had left it on the sill and did not hum. Pax\u2019s messages burned holes in her pocket. Caelan\u2019s promise sat like a stone at the bottom of a river. The city was being very honest about wanting to rearrange her.\n\nThat night, when men in coats had drunk their tea and gone home to houses in neighborhoods that didn\u2019t get ash on the parapets, when the Lancers had eaten something like food and laughed at jokes they would not remember next week, when Kestrel came by and pretended she needed to borrow salt and left with three jars of jam and a glare, Mara took the ring into the bathroom like it was a confidante. She sat on the closed lid of the toilet and looked at her face and did not decide whether she liked it. She put the ring on and said a number out loud she had not said in public in fifteen years. The ring made a sound like a kettle remembering itself.\n\nThe melody that arrived was not the one she had made. It was narrower. It was the sort of tune an alley might sing to announce that it was safe to leave a back door unlatched for someone who needed to come in and sit on the floor for a minute. She hummed into it and let words catch. She did not think about audiences. She did not think about Ash. She thought about men in rooms who wrote their other lives on stone and women who hit rings with their knuckles and made them behave. She thought about drums and onion soup and the way sugar can taste underground if you are careful.\n\nDown in the south tunnels, Caelan put his hand to the place where the ash had been and felt nothing but cool stone and the memory of a pressure like a stranger\u2019s forehead against yours. Jaro said something obscene about luck and Ran reminded him luck is a person and she charges rent. They turned to go and three of them turned back because they thought they heard a man laughing. It wasn\u2019t a nice laugh. It was the kind of laugh that shakes out of a person like a cough. The sound didn\u2019t come from the door shape or the O or any of the places a sensible man would look. It came from a seam in the wall that would not be a seam unless you were the sort of person who had read too many names and asked for more.\n\nCaelan touched the seam without touching it. He thought of a corridor and a boy and a knife and a long thin wire of a song pulled taut through someone else\u2019s throat. He did not know that across the city a man in a cell had just signed his name to a program that would teach him to name objects until naming them made him less of one. He did not know that a woman upstairs in a bathroom on a street with old trees had just found a tune you could carry home in your pocket without anyone noticing.\n\nHe did know the difference between knocking and not. He knew that the Ash Sovereign did not ask for permission. He knew someone else might. He kept his hand steady over the seam and said the sort of sentence you say to a room when you would like it to believe you are not afraid and would like to believe that too. He said, \u201cNot tonight.\u201d\n\nThe seam held. The room did not open. The ash did not return. The city, tired of pretending, rolled itself onto the other shoulder and slept the kind of sleep that admits it has a problem. In apartments like explosives and closets like boats, people relistened because relistening is a form of prayer. In a prison like a throat, a man fell asleep with ink on his fingers. In a kitchen like a safe place, a mother put a bowl over a paper flower and decided it wasn\u2019t allowed to harm her house because she said so. In a tower like a mistake, a governor wrote a sentence in a speech that included the word maiden, and then crossed it out, and wrote it again, and crossed it out again, and settled for citizen because he had to live with the women who would hear him.\n\nAt the window in the blue-threaded light of three in the morning, Mara pressed her palm flat to the pane. The ring was warm. The river moved as if someone had put a chord under it. She did not promise herself away. She did not promise herself to herself, either; the world had taught her that was a dangerous sort of vow. She breathed and counted to seven and then lost the numbers because a rhythm had found her that was not counting and was not silence and was not the city taking what it wanted. It was the small sound you make when you decide to be brave again tomorrow. It was not an anthem. It did not have a beat you could dance to, unless your dance was the sort where you lean on a counter and laugh too loud so you will know you are alive.",

                              "content": "Morning took a long time deciding to arrive in the Old Weavers and, when it did, it came through the kitchen window like someone late to a party bringing bread to apologize. Edda had already done the practical warfare of wiping down the table twice, not because it was dirty but because doing so put the world temporarily into her jurisdiction. The paper flower sat under a mixing bowl, which made the cat very religious about the bowl, circling it and saying quiet cat things to it as if prayer would keep unfortunate paper from learning new tricks. Mara poured tea and did not put the ring on until she had watched the steam for three long breaths and decided she had the edges for it. The weight on her finger altered the taste of the tea; she could taste a faint metal that was not cup and not spoon, an optimism that made her want to swear and knock on wood simultaneously.\n\nKestrel arrived with a speed that made you suspect she had been downstairs on the second-floor landing timing the moments between footsteps. She threw herself into a chair like it was about to be stolen and put a folded piece of onion-skin paper on the table with reverence and profanity co-existing in the gesture. The paper was thinner than a whisper and twice as sure of itself. Inside it, a hand had written with a nib that had a lot of opinions: We have hot water and we do not waste it on men. Bring your throat. Old Baths, noon. It smelled faintly of rosemary, the way old sweat can if it has been mixed with years of soap and women\u2019s conversations about things no council ever included on their agendas.\n\nEdda dried her hands and looked at the paper like it came from a school friend she had laughed with three governments ago. She touched the edge and then touched Mara\u2019s wrist. \u201cYou should go,\u201d she said, and the should had a weight to it like a bowl you set down firmly so that it doesn\u2019t try to participate in the argument. \u201cIf you are going to carry a ring with this much bad manners, you should at least speak with the women who taught the last one to mind its shoes indoors.\u201d\n\nMara wanted to say she had a meeting with Pax and another meeting with a man whose job title was a form of apology, but the paper\u2019s rosemary smell reached into her and arranged her objections into less useful shapes. She drank the tea. She ate the end of a heel of bread she did not want. She put her hand flat over the bowl with the paper flower and felt nothing but porcelain and inherited stubbornness, which relieved her more than she expected it to. \u201cNoon,\u201d she said, and saw the way both women in the room half exhaled like a bellows releasing.\n\nThe Old Baths had been retired three times\u2014by war, by fashion, by men who liked to put taxes on things women enjoyed\u2014and survived each retirement by pretending to be a ruin until the new rules forgot they existed. The street outside them did not remember when carriages had clattered and men had tipped hats; it remembered quilts hung on lines and steam like early fog and small, savage arguments over which soap made the best lather for hair that behaved like weather. The door had a polite sign that said Closed for Private Restoration, which was the city\u2019s way of saying You do not have enough knowledge to come in right now. Kestrel knocked the knock women knock in funny corners to tell other women they are not here to rearrange anybody. The lock took a moment to remember who it had been forged for and then yielded with a sound like a small regret.\n\nInside, the air was gratitude and humidity. The tiled room had not been allowed to be pretty; it had insisted on it instead. On the far wall, under a fresco of women with hair like rivers who had lasted out three faiths and never been repainted, sat six women and a kettle. They were not old or young. They were all the ages that mattered. Three of them were now-famous cowards who had refused to stand up and sing when asked by a dead church with a live appetite and the city had survived anyway. Two wore smocks. One wore a coat with pockets that were either full of instruments or full of small knives. None of them stood. None of them smiled in the preliminary way.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d said the one in the coat, who had salt on her cuffs and steam in her voice. \u201cYou argued with the water last night until it remembered it needed to boil. Sit. Shoes off. Rings off. We do not drop things in the hot that we haven\u2019t named.\u201d\n\nMara took off her boots and set them aside with the care you use for friends. She slipped the ring and put it on her palm. It hummed exactly once like a short laugh, and then made a display of being obedient. She sat on the tile, which cooled her at once and made her feel like a child at kitchen level. Kestrel sat cross-legged beside her, and the eyeliner made her look like a very precise heretic. The kettle poured into small cups as if pouring were a sacrament and not a mechanics of gravity.\n\n\u201cWe are not the Choir,\u201d said a woman with a line of scars that disappeared under the neck of her shirt and reappeared near her wrist like a small river that got lost and then found itself again. \u201cWe were the whisper behind the Choir, the aunties, the thieves, the ones who wrote the lists when the men thought lists were theirs. The Choir scattered rather than be told when to inhale. We did not scatter. We went to make soap and raise boys and teach girls that singing is not performance, it is barricade. The card you got was rude. We do apologies after. I am Soria.\u201d\n\nMara balanced the cup in both hands and dared to smell it. It was not rosemary. It was lavender and something like iron. It was the smell of the basin in her grandmother\u2019s yard, the one she remembered without ever having seen. \u201cI am Mara,\u201d she said, and felt foolish at introducing herself to women who had already decided what she was to them. \u201cI have something that doesn\u2019t belong to me and I used it and it worked and now the city is making noises like furniture being dragged upstairs at an hour when furniture should not be dragged anywhere. I don\u2019t want to be owned by it. Or by the city. Or by anyone with a patch. I also don\u2019t want to let the Gates go back to sleep. How ridiculous to want anything at all.\u201d\n\nKestrel put a shoulder lightly against Mara\u2019s as if to stop her from listing too hard. Soria made a how-old-are-you face that had nothing to do with numbers and everything to do with what you had given up to keep your throat for yourself. \u201cIt does not belong to anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cThe ring belongs to the city we want, not to the city we have. It is not obedient. It prefers cleverness. You have some. You will need more. They will ask you to give it back to sleep. They will say that sleep is safer. Perhaps for them. You will go on not sleeping well for a while. The only thing you must not do is pretend to be quiet when you are not built for it. That will ruin you. We prefer our girls unruined, or at least ruined in interesting ways that annoy the correct men.\u201d\n\nA laugh went around the tile like quick water. Mara tried out the smile that was showing up on the faces of women who were not her and found that it fit her mouth as if it had been there before. \u201cThe song last night,\u201d said the one with the pockets of tools or knives, and her voice had a tiny line in it that said she had once been paid to sing to men who could not find sleep any other way. \u201cThere was a bleed. Did you feel it.\u201d\n\nMara thought of sugar underground and men in tunnels tasting sweets that had no business in rust. \u201cSomething else rode it,\u201d she said, and the women made the sound women make when they have been waiting to hear someone else say the thing their bodies had already told them. \u201cI was told to keep it dirty and I did and something took the dirt and drew in it. It made an O. It pressed itself against a door and did not knock.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ash faction isn\u2019t interested in asking,\u201d said Soria, which made the tile feel briefly colder. \u201cThat is someone else. We thought perhaps one of the Quiets had gotten out of a grave and decided to be polite before being unkind. But the politeness smelled like sugar, which they thought was a sin and which we know to be breakfast. There is a girl under the river who uses sugar to teach ash to be letters. She is either going to save us or make a very beautiful mess. Both, probably.\u201d\n\nKestrel made a face that announced her two opinions about girls under rivers and both of those opinions involved rescuing and lecturing. Mara looked down at the ring and thought about letters that were almost doors and men laughing where they should not be allowed to. \u201cI heard a laugh,\u201d she said, and watched the flinch happen not on Soria\u2019s face but in the shoulders of the woman three over, who had put her cup down without quite knowing she was going to. \u201cIt was not near me. It was near a seam someone I don\u2019t know was not touching. I dislike laughter without a body. It makes my skin feel like it\u2019s being written on.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will have to learn seams,\u201d said Soria. \u201cThey are where the city keeps its forgettings. They are often next to places where men are stored. You will leave those alone unless you intend to open them and what comes out is your responsibility forever. We will teach you the vowel that tells seams they are unattractive to you. It is a vowel men cannot make well because it requires a flexibility they do not cultivate.\u201d\n\nThey did not sing in the way Mara had expected women in an old bath to sing. They breathed on a note together and the room shifted the way a large animal adjusts under your hand so your palm rests in the right place for its bones. They showed her how to shape her mouth to make the safer-latch tune she had invented last night sit on her tongue and ready itself to be given away without robbing her more than she could spare. They put her feet in hot water and told her to count until she forgot numbers and remembered rhythm. They told her to think of onion soup and then of knives. They told her to invent for herself an ugly cheer so that when she had to sing beautiful she would still have an unbeautiful thing she could hold that was just for her.\n\nWhen they were done teaching her the vowel and three bad-tempered consonants that belonged with it, Soria took the ring on her palm and let the water fog roll over it. The ring fogged and then cleared itself without anyone making a move. The women nodded because sometimes your tools are alive and it is good to see them wipe their own mouth after eating. \u201cThey will want to audit you,\u201d Soria said, passing the ring back. \u201cThey will want to list your body and the parts of it they think belong to documents. If you sign, make sure the paper becomes yours. Name it. Bite it a little if you have to.\u201d\n\nOutside, noon made light like a man whittling a piece of wood and getting too much pleasure out of the neatness of the curls. Pax was in the car because of course he was; he had a way of being where you had decided you would need him five minutes before you knew you would. He wore a tie now as a personal experiment in not cursing at men older than him when he had to say sentences with words like proper channels in them. He opened the door and his face made the expression a person makes when they see a room has rinsed you and given you back your skin. It was both admiration and end-of-the-world relief. Kestrel did a little bow so low it upset two pigeons and slid in after Mara like she had paid to be there and refused a refund.\n\n\u201cThey want to log the ring as an object of city interest,\u201d Pax said without saying hello, because hello felt like a word you used when nothing was on fire. \u201cAnnotations sent a form that is almost reasonable, which makes me suspicious. The Division wants a copy. The Lord Governor wants a statement we write for him that makes him sound less like a man who was delivered to this job as a prank. Roe wants to know if you swallowed a bee on that fifth phrase because she can weave it out if it starts to sting the wrong place. Also the pastry woman sent me a note that says she will accept my promise and my favor and would I like jam.\u201d\n\nMara held the ring in her fist because it made her feel less like a thing with a handle. \u201cI went to the Baths,\u201d she said, and Pax\u2019s eyes did the small close-lid thing like a man closing the door to his better nature before he said something careless. \u201cThey taught me a vowel. They told me not to open seams even if someone with a laugh asks me to. They used sugar to talk about ash. There is a girl under the river doing geometry with candy and we should either help her or steal her, and I find that I am too tired to know which is moral.\u201d\n\nPax turned his head just enough that she could see the part of his face that would never be televised, the part that got young when he was letting himself be more dangerous than useful. \u201cGood,\u201d he said softly. \u201cIf they like you they will save your life two or three times in ways that aren\u2019t dramatic enough to be fun. If they don\u2019t like you they will merely keep you from embarrassing yourself in public, which is kindness of another order. We have to go to Annotations. We will smile and use the word consent until a man tries to bite his tongue off.\u201d\n\nAnnotations lived in a building that had been a bank and had not learned to be different. The foyer had floors that made your heel sound seditious. The elevator smelled oily and safe. The reception desk was a beautiful woman with a mouth like a ledger. Aron Tull met them with a card already in his hand, which meant he had practiced the smile he wanted to wear when the person he intended to put in a folder arrived not wanting to be a folder. He wore gray the way some men wear wars, like a garment they were never meant to take off.\n\n\u201cThe form is a form,\u201d he said, and even his hands looked like paper. \u201cIt says the object is declared, the chain of provenance is under inquiry, and the bearer is recognized as temporarily authorized for civic broadcast activities under supervision. It protects you. It protects us from you. It protects the city from both of us.\u201d\n\nPax sat with the elegant violence of a man who knows the power of chairs and is prepared to wield it. \u201cIt is ten words too long,\u201d he said, and smiled with nine teeth and not the tenth. \u201cIt says supervision. The Charter says counsel. It is a famous difference. It says chain of provenance, which would be a lovely phrase to write poetry about if you were a poet and it did not mean men with stamps get to tell stories about women\u2019s throats. You may have a form. It may not have that language.\u201d\n\nAron\u2019s expression did a small calculation that would have been attractive if it were not being performed on a person he wanted to inventory. \u201cWe can change a word,\u201d he conceded as if he were lowering a drawbridge in a house with no moat. \u201cWe would also like an impression of the ring. For the registry.\u201d\n\nMara put her hands on the table and her ring hand not on the paper. She could feel Kestrel next to her making a silent scream face because Kestrel had never met a registry she liked. She looked at the page and thought of Soria\u2019s advice. She thought of biting. She thought of naming paper until it belonged to her instead of to the man who had printed it. She picked up the pen and wrote her name and then, without asking, wrote: I name this paper and its brothers a comfort. You may not be used to being named. Learn.\n\nAron read the sentence and smiled in the way men smile when they have been outflanked in a petty way and intend to win later when no one is watching. \u201cWe respect language,\u201d he said, and put a stamp on the bottom that made the sheet buzz very gently like it had swallowed a fly. \u201cWe will get out of your hair. Do remember to return our calls. If the Sovereign\u2019s ash starts to shake itself onto our chairs and leave shape-words, we will wish we had more forms, not fewer.\u201d\n\nThey left with a copy of the paper that had learned its new name and with a memory of Aron\u2019s smile that would be useful later in identifying which weapon he thought he was holding. Pax put his hand on the low of Mara\u2019s back as they walked out, his fingers an inch away from contact as if he were restraining himself from being the sort of man who guided women with his palm. \u201cThey are going to try very nicely,\u201d he said in the tone men used to talk about storms when the windows were already rattling. \u201cThe Division will not be nice. I have a friend on the lower stairs who thinks he can keep the word custodian off your file. That friend will either become our problem soon or our prayer. Meanwhile, Roe is in a mood. She found something in the recording she has not seen since\u2014well. Since I had a different hairstyle and did not believe in my own death.\u201d\n\nHollow Sun was a different building by daylight. It had been designed to make you love it at night, which meant that in the morning it looked like the aftermath of a party you were too clever to attend. Roe was in her chair, which was not a throne because she would have burned a throne for warmth. She had four screens up: one with waveforms, one with a map of the old Quietite runes lit to show passage, one with a cartoon cat, and one with a list of equipment requests she had previously been told were extravagant and would now be met because the city had remembered to be frightened.\n\n\u201cYou invited a passenger,\u201d she said without saying hello, and pointed with her chin at the waveform where, under Mara\u2019s vocal, there ran the faintest of other voices like a silk thread under a coarse seam. \u201cYou left the line open and something leaned in and said its name without saying it. This is not ash. This is\u2014this is something that knows the old way a door opens and has been respectful about knocking because it wants to be invited to dinner rather than let itself in and eat the cat.\u201d\n\nPax took his jacket off as if he had been dying to do so since breakfast. \u201cSugar,\u201d he said, because he liked to get there first sometimes even when it didn\u2019t matter. \u201cCaelan smelled sugar underground. Soria says there\u2019s a girl with lessons in candy. You\u2019re telling us the ring chased itself down a sweet and found a seam.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am telling you not to open it,\u201d Roe said, and looked at Mara with the unsmiling courtesy of someone who had stood beside enough disasters to have a palate for their taste. \u201cYou are tired and tired people make bargains with doors because doors look like answers when your feet hurt. The seam has a frequency. I will write you the note that tells it to mind its business for a day and a night. After that, if it is still polite, we ask it if its mother taught it to rinse cups or put them in the sink dirty. That will tell us which side raised it.\u201d\n\nThe day tried very hard, then, to behave like a day. They did three interviews. Mara answered questions while wearing sunglasses that did not make her invisible and did make her feel like a friend of theirs would appear if she reached for her pocket. Pax lied successfully on her behalf twice and was honest once on accident. Roe delivered the note handwritten on the back of a bus schedule: a set of bars with no clef and the barest notations in the corner in an alphabet that did not announce itself to strangers. Kestrel stole three pastries and shared two. Edda called twice to ask if anyone would be home to eat the stew that had suddenly decided it needed to exist.\n\nBy late afternoon, the part of a city\u2019s day when everyone\u2019s temper gets thin and their posture worse, Caelan sent a message that was not a message, because he did not believe in making himself easy to subpoena. It was a bouquet of words delivered by a boy who smelled of coal dust and soup: bridge, south, sugar again, be clever, no heroics. Pax read it and did a thing with his mouth that meant he would be heroic in a way no one could blame him for later. Mara read it and felt an irritation that was almost relief. Kestrel read it and said absolutely not out loud and then yes under her breath because the under-breath is where your bravery negotiates with your sense.\n\nThe bridge at South Span had several moods, and that afternoon it wore the one that said it had put up with hurricanes and weddings and men who thought a proposal needed an audience; it would put up with this as well. Lancers in plain clothes had made the crowd look like a crowd that did not intend to panic. Caelan was where he belonged in a space like that: nowhere obvious and everywhere at once, the way a sound can come from a wall you didn\u2019t realize had a body behind it. The ash traces were not dramatic. They were less than the dust from a baker\u2019s sleeve and more than should be, arranged in a shape that had gotten to the second letter and been interrupted by a hand that decided to behave. There was sugar too, which glittered when the light hit it and sank into the ash with the tenderness of ingredients in a batter.\n\n\u201cWe are going to keep people moving,\u201d Caelan said into the small boil of attention Pax carried with him into any scene. \u201cWe are not going to say the words you must not say. We are going to stand here like the city watching the river and we are not going to be impressed. We are not going to be provoked. If the seam shows its teeth, you are going to sing that note Roe gave you quietly enough that only doors hear it. If the ash tries to be beautiful, you will not praise it.\u201d\n\nMara nodded because nodding was safer than promising. The ring warmed without asking her permission to do so. She took a position not in the middle and not on the edge and watched the light change along the surface of the river with the kind of attention that makes you forget where your hands are. The crowd, being a crowd, did crowd things: moved forward, moved back, made a sound that was half complaint and half thrill. Kestrel started a conversation with a woman whose job was cutting keys and who had strong opinions about the way men understood locks and none of those opinions were positive. Pax, as was his religious habit, refused to stand still and therefore could be in four very necessary places in five minutes.\n\nThe seam made the smallest surrender of itself and then stopped. The ash became an O again the way a mouth does when it has decided to say one thing and thinks better of it. The sugar glinted as if some ridiculous child under the river had whispered Now. Mara put the note in her mouth and hummed it inward like a coin you swallow because someone is trying to take it from you. The seam did not open. It acknowledged and retreated. Caelan relaxed a degree no one else on the bridge was trained to detect.\n\nIt would have ended as well as anything ends in a city like Eydolon\u2014untidily and almost\u2014if three men had not decided they were very tired of quiet. They were not ash. They were not sugar. They were the sort of men who sell other men maps to places that never existed and then get offended when those men show up at their doors and ask for a refund. They had knives they were proud of and jackets that made them look like they had joined a club which would let in any man who liked jackets. One of them had a paper flower pinned to his lapel with a safety pin, and the paper did not turn to ash because whoever had made it had calculated the weather.\n\nThey moved toward the place where the seam had let its O be visible and Caelan was there before their forward momentum could get them into any useful trouble. He did not draw a weapon. He did not need to. The particular way he put his foot down was architectural; the air around a step like that gets busy making a wall because it suspects it might be safer to be masonry right now. The man with the paper flower smiled a smile he had practiced in front of a mirror with the sound of other people\u2019s fear as his accompaniment. \u201cWe just want a look,\u201d he said, inserting his voice into the public space the way you insert a knife into a letter you are not meant to read. \u201cWant to see what the city thinks it\u2019s hiding.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the city keeps to itself,\u201d Caelan said, and his tone did not rise, \u201cis the reason you can stand here this afternoon and pretend to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nThe man looked past him with the audacity of fools. He saw Mara and did a small calculation almost as quickly as Aron Tull had and came up with different numbers. He did not look at her hands because some men are very good at not looking where you ought to look and very bad at looking where you must not. \u201cSinger,\u201d he said, with the tone that makes the word an accusation and a proposition at once. \u201cYou brought a song down here. Sing again. Let it through.\u201d\n\nMara had spent a long time in rooms where men told her to smile and did not believe her when she said, No. The old baths had put a vowel in her mouth that told the city to look elsewhere. Roe\u2019s bus-schedule had drawn her a line to keep her feet on. She touched the ring with the thumb of her other hand because a part of her was still a fool for ritual. Then she said, very pleasantly, as if she were at the pastry counter and the last beautiful thing had just been bought by someone else, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nThe man smiled because he thought he was owed another word. He reached for her because men who think they are owed say more with their arms than with their mouths. He did not reach her. Caelan moved without the flourish he could allow himself when he fought men with practice. He put two fingers against the man\u2019s wrist and reminded the man of the anatomy he had forgotten, that there is a bone under the skin that will tell you stories you cannot pretend are not true. The knife dropped, which was undramatic but helpful. Jaro relieved a second man of the pretense he had ever been allowed to be dangerous in public, and Ran spoke softly into the ear of the third until his body remembered that breathing is a condition and not a promise.\n\nThere was a moment when it could have become a thing people wrote speeches about. The seam did its small not-enough trick. The ash lifted and made the barest flourish of a new shape. The sugar drifted like snow. Kestrel grabbed Mara\u2019s elbow and pretended she was the one holding her up when what she was doing was making herself a wall you had to go through if you wanted to put your hands on her friend. Pax moved a half step forward and then stopped because he was learning, which looked like hesitation but was the bravest thing he could teach himself.\n\nMara hummed the note again. She put her mouth near the seam without touching it and said the vowel Soria had pressed into her like a seed pressed into dirt. The seam made a disappointed sound very few people heard because it was a sound you know only if you have ever been a door with excellent intentions. The ash fell. The men were collected by the city the way a spill is collected by good rags. The bridge, having seen better and worse, pretended it had been an afternoon like any other.\n\nThey did not celebrate. They went home the way you go home after you have refused to let the wrong thing happen in public: with the particular quiet of people who do not want to give the day the satisfaction of not having ruined them. Pax made stew consumption an official requirement. Kestrel made Edda laugh with three new words she had invented on the way over. Caelan stood at the parapet and looked at the place where the ash had tried to spell a second letter and let his face admit to the sort of fear that wakes you and makes you check, at four in the morning, that the doors are all still on the hinges.\n\nMarrowgate breathed in the way big buildings breathe when dusk pushes the heat back into the core. Silas had written a paragraph he did not hate, which made him distrust the paragraph immediately. Lale returned his papers with a note on the top in a handwriting that looked like a good staircase: If you write three more, I can pay you in something other than apples. I am thinking of stamps. Try to keep your sentences from killing anyone. It will make my job with the censors shorter. He read it twice and then put it under the thin pillow because people steal fewer jokes than food, and he would rather be hungry than humorless.\n\nHe felt the seam when the city let out that small disappointed door-sound. He did not know what the sound was and his body learned it anyway. He looked at the wall as if it had learned his name and then politely forgotten it because it had company. He stood without deciding to stand and put his hand to the place the seam had taught him to find with the blind second sight people grow in cages. Across the city a woman pressed a vowel into stone and a vampire told a door to behave. The vibration through his bones ended at a frequency that made the skin at the back of his neck try to climb into his hair. He laughed, not nicely, and immediately apologized to the room without using any words because he had long since learned walls hold grudges.\n\nNight behaved for a few hours. Men in coats stopped working at their desks and looked at their children as if they were borrowed and due back. The pastry shop shooed the last people out with the sort of bedtime stories only sugar can make. Roe fell asleep in her chair with her hand on the mouse and the mouse had the decency not to go waking things up while she wasn\u2019t watching. Soria locked the Baths and then unlocked them because she remembered a girl used the back entrance when she needed to sit in the heat alone and talk herself out of making a glorious mistake. Edda put the bowl back over the paper flower because the devil does not get tired even when you do.\n\nThen the city did what it always does when you believe you have negotiated one more day from it. It asked a price in a different currency. At three a great many windows hummed. Not screaming, not singing, not shattering. Humming, like a throat warming up. Mara sat up in the bed without the part where she wakes and sat and in the sitting was a wakefulness that had nothing to do with sleep or the absence of it. The ring warmed and then cooled as if it had put on a coat and taken it off again in the wrong season. Outside, low and along the river, a small procession of light moved like a thought a man doesn\u2019t want to finish.\n\nCaelan was on the parapet; that was his foolishness and his virtue. He saw the procession and did not call for trumpets. He did not like trumpets for first drafts. He sent the small signal that meant bring me twelve and the kind who know that knees matter as much as shoulders. The procession was too orderly to be ash and too cautious to be Lancers and too quiet to be the city being itself on a night it could get away with it. It looked like men carrying something that had been heavy once and had remembered to be light.\n\nThey brought the thing into the switchyard and put it down with the care you give equipment that saved you once and could break you now if you looked like you didn\u2019t respect it. It was a door in a frame with no wall, and the door was made of glass that had been broken and mended with metal that had learned humility late and was very good at pretending. The men stepped back. They were not ash. They were not officers. They were city workers with good shoulders and the kind of look you acquire when a supervisor tells you to do a thing and you do it but you also decide privately whether that thing belongs to this city or some other you do not consent to.\n\nCaelan put his hand out the way you put your hand out to an animal that has already decided whether it will bite you. The door did not move. Behind him, Jaro said a word that would have made Soria throw a bar of soap at his head. Ran sucked her teeth and then asked, because she was the one with a questions inventory, \u201cWhere did you find a Quietite door you could carry.\u201d\n\nThe man in front with the practical shoulders scratched his nose, which made him human, and said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t. It was leaned up under the bridge. Like somebody had needed to take it out for air.\u201d\n\nThe door hummed. The same hum the windows had. The same hum the seam had admitted but not consented to. Caelan did not call Pax because this had gone past art and into religion and he disliked to be observed while taking sacraments. He did not call Mara because three in the morning belonged to her for sleeping even if the city wanted to make it otherwise. He did not call the Division because once you invite them to your party you will find your guest list has been altered for the rest of your social life. He put his hand on the glass with the insolent humility that had kept him alive longer than many. The glass was not cold and not warm. It tasted in his bones like sugar and ash have a child together and no one wants to talk about whose eyes it got.\n\nHe said, because it had worked once, \u201cNot tonight.\u201d\n\nThe door hummed exactly once and then shut itself, which was a neat trick given it was already closed. The hum ran off into the rails and along the river and into small kitchens where kettles tried to remember if they were alive. Mara lay back down and counted until numbers were not numbers again. Silas sat on the floor with his back to the seam and sang under his breath very badly on purpose because it was a song that did not belong to him and he thought perhaps if he were rude to it, it would go away like a wrong cat.\n\nBy dawn the door was gone. Someone had moved it or it had decided to move itself and the Lancers looked at the empty space and did the particular shoulder motion that meant a thing had happened and they would deal with the next thing instead. Roe woke with a stiff neck and a flood of messages and one note under her mouse, which made her feel homicidal and fond at once. The note said: sugar is not the enemy. It had no signature, and three grains of sugar glued themselves to her thumb as if to prove a point.\n\nAt breakfast, Edda lifted the bowl and the paper flower was still paper. She took it in both hands, went to the sink, and held it over the drain. She looked at her daughter, and her daughter nodded as if in a ritual someone would write down later. Edda tore the paper gently into small pieces and then smaller. She turned on the tap and held the pieces in the water until they were pulp. She did not wash them away. She took the pulp and pressed it flat and set it by the window to dry as a new sheet. \u201cYou do not get to say what you are,\u201d she told it. \u201cI do.\u201d\n\nMara ate bread and stew and sugar off her thumb and watched the world be very brave in small ways. She had a meeting at ten with a woman whose job was to make men in another building believe there was a budget for art and a ferocity at noon with Pax about where the money would come from if there was not. She had a promise with Caelan for later about south tunnels and the kind of map you do not draw on paper. She had to send Roe a recording of a humming because the engineer wanted to build a fence out of it. She had to write to Kestrel a message that said I will not be brave if brave means being stupid. She had to breathe.\n\nOutside, the billboards had finally changed. They did not have the right face up yet\u2014the city is always late to its own party\u2014but they had stopped pretending nothing had happened. The Gate towers did their quiet advertisement. The pigeons tilted their heads like old men remembering a joke. The river carried on. Somewhere under it, a girl with sticky fingers counted sugar grains like notes. Somewhere in a building with a seam, a man wrote three more paragraphs and did not write the boy\u2019s name because he had written it enough for one life. Somewhere on a parapet, a vampire lord looked at a place where a door had been and rolled his shoulders and felt ancient and, against his will, interested.\n\nAnd somewhere in a bath where the mural\u2019s women had new water on their hair, Soria wrote a line on the wall with steam that said, in a hand the city used to pick locks, If you are going to ruin yourself, do it to a rhythm that makes a decent story. Then the water ran and the steam blurred it and the line went into the tile, which is where the city keeps the advice it refuses to frame.",

                              "content": "Chapter 8\n\nThe budget woman had a smile like a stapler and a wall of framed certificates that tried to convince you she had been born at a desk and had never known the indignity of a kitchen towel. She wore her hair in the kind of bun mothers save for funerals and for days when their daughters say they want to learn to ride other people\u2019s motorcycles. Her office window faced a brick wall because no one trusted cultural funding to survive a view. She introduced herself as Deputy Comptroller Riane Pell in a tone that made each syllable an invoice and asked Mara to sit without looking at the chair, as if chairs had chosen her long ago and she no longer had to negotiate with them.\n\nPax did not sit because he believed in the psychology of legs and because he liked to make paper-heavy rooms remember a body. He spoke first, not to antagonize but to put a layer of plausible charm over the fact that his mere arrival made her budget sheets itch. He laid out the arithmetic the way a man tells you a story with the fair parts in it. Charter Song broadcast. Training morale. The small measurable reductions in injury during patrols when men marched with something to hum under their teeth instead of the tired version of themselves. The tiny uptick in bread sales in the northern quarter at dawn which meant bakers were confident enough to bake extra and people had decided to mix yeast with hope, not scarcity.\n\nDeputy Pell listened with her eyes on a point beyond Pax\u2019s shoulder, which was where she kept a picture of her grandmother in a hat you only wore when there were parades. She let him free-climb the side of her building without a rope and then gave him nothing but a handkerchief. Grants were closed for the quarter. Emergency disbursement required an Event Code number. In-kind support could be offered if they registered the ring as an asset under City Holdings. The phrase in-kind tasted like paper dipped in broth and called a meal. She said it with a clean mouth anyway.\n\nMara had expected to be bored and then to be angry in a small, elegant way that carried no calories. She found herself instead watching the woman\u2019s hands. They were older than the hair and younger than the mouth and they hold a pen like a wand someone had told her was a sword before she learned what swords are for. She thought of all the ways women learned to negotiate with men who came asking for money to make noise and how sometimes the cheapest thing you could spend was affection. She did not spend it. She explained instead that if the city decided to hold the ring in a room with inventory numbers on pegs, then the city could keep the keys and she would go back to singing in kitchens with the taps yelling, and the Night Lancers could march to the sound of their own boots, which was a fine beat for a funeral.\n\nDeputy Pell\u2019s stapler-smile flickered, which was not victory but a movement some women make when another woman says No in public and the room does not fall down. She asked how much, then, if money could be convinced to wear a dress and meet them in a hallway for five minutes. Roe had given Pax numbers written in two inks, one that said truth and one that said lie for the Lord Governor. Pax gave the truth and cut off the last digit because he intended to get it back in favors and hardware. Deputy Pell wrote a figure down and Mara watched the ink turn into a kind of altar. The woman had a budget for clean water and broken windows and paying the six men who wrote speeches and the two women who made those speeches into sentences someone could keep in their mouths. Somewhere she had found a pocket where you keep money for the kind of days that shake your hand and the bone under your hand at once. She opened it enough to be insulting if you were greedy or a blessing if you had their sense of humor.\n\nWhen they left, Pax kissed the air near the Deputy\u2019s temple as if to say we have both survived worse and I will not tell if you do not. On the steps in the sun, he leaned against a column like a man who had fallen in love with architecture and knew better. He told Mara that he had once thought money could be sung into existence and learned it could only be conned, cajoled, borrowed, and wedged under doors until the door couldn\u2019t close on you without admitting its bad manners. He asked her if she could bear to sing again by nightfall if someone else\u2019s bad manners insisted we must. She said she would eat stew first and then perhaps set a small fire in the bath to keep her courage hot. He promised stew, bath, courage, fire, and then gave her the kind of smile he hid from crowds because it made them forgiving and forgiveness was a commodity the city refused to trade honestly.\n\nThe south tunnels were a temperature you usually only found inside rivers and behind old church doors. Caelan met them where the rail dipped and was forced to confess it had never been properly level. He wore his crest without polish and had a smear of something on his sleeve that could have been oil or old blood and which he had not had time to decide on in a way he approved. Ran went ahead like a thought you had on purpose; Jaro brought up the rear like the line at a bakery after rain. Mara felt the ring like a dog that refuses to heel and also refuses to run away. She hummed Roe\u2019s seam-note under her breath because sometimes warding is rehearsing not to scream.\n\nThe sugar was not a dust now. It was a logic. Somebody had arranged bright grains along the line of old runes that hadn\u2019t been pressed by a foot in a generation. The pattern didn\u2019t match the book the Division printed and issued to warders in a package with a brass whistle and an oath you were meant to revise as needed. It matched something else, something the room liked and had been embarrassed about remembering. The ash had set in little hairline patches where the sugar stuck rather than melted, as if it had decided it wanted to touch sweetness and did not know how to behave on a first meeting.\n\nA girl sat twelve yards ahead on a crate that had once held apples and now held a chemistry of items the city would not list under ingredients. She had a sack of sugar tied at three points so that any thief who cut it would split it into three petty disappointments. She had a tin of salt, a glass jar of borrowed honey sealed with wax like a promise someone made in a kitchen with witnesses, and a box of hard candy stolen from a hospital cart or gifted by a nurse with a look that said keep your mouth shut when you enjoy this. Her hair was tied with a ribbon that had been string in its past life and would be a handle in its next. She looked at Mara and Caelan the way gulls look at storms and did not move. It took Mara a too-long second to realize why the girl\u2019s face carried the kind of stillness people try to cultivate in meditation and achieve once at most, usually in a disaster. The stillness was not composure. It was the habit of someone who had not been spoken to often enough to get good at performing speech for other people\u2019s comfort.\n\nKestrel, who had insisted on coming because she had made an appointment with her own regret to meet at the end of the day and did not intend to be late, stopped just behind Mara and took the exact measure of the sugar in one glance because women like her grew up measuring grams with their eyes and deciding if you could get away with stealing one. She swallowed something that might have been the impulse to be the first to speak.\n\nCaelan did it for all of them and took his gloves off first because he was not stupid enough to reach for a child with his hands dressed for war. He tilted his head and let his mouth be less severe. He asked, in a voice a dog would bring a shoe to, \u201cIs this your work.\u201d\n\nThe girl looked at the ash like it had offered her a ride and she had declined. She did not nod and did not shake her head, because koans are fine at noon and useless in tunnels. She took a hard candy from the box, unwrapped it with fingers that did not tremble and held it out to Caelan as if to say you might not be allowed this, and I will enjoy seeing if you refuse. He put out his hand and she walked the steps between crate and angle of his wrist like someone who had learned to count to keep from drowning. She placed the candy in his palm with a precision that made you want to apologize for ever having been clumsy. He put it on his tongue without looking down, because he understood rites he had not invented.\n\nMara tried to find where the room\u2019s hum lay without asking it to hum for her. Roe\u2019s note tucked itself against her palate on instinct. The girl\u2019s eyes moved; there was a river in them and also a city and neither felt proprietary about which parts belonged to whom. She took the tin of salt and let two grains fall onto the sugar diagram as if letting birds out of a pocket. The ash lifted very slightly, a contented animal repositioning. The girl smiled once, quick as a coin in a magician\u2019s hand and as unhelpful to anyone trying to make a lesson of it.\n\n\u201cWhat are we calling you,\u201d Kestrel asked, because names are knives and you hand people the handles you mean them to hold.\n\nThe girl put her finger through the ribbon at her wrist and pulled it tighter like a tourniquet made from sentiment. Her mouth shaped two sounds without letting sound out. She showed them to Mara the way you show someone a paper airplane right before you throw it. The shape of those mouth-movements mattered more than any letters that might get written. They were the vowels you make when you taste something you have never tasted that might be poisonous and you decide to finish anyway. Mara nodded as if she had been told, and repeated the shape, quieter. \u201cAnise,\u201d she said, and the girl\u2019s mouth moved again in a way that admitted this was approximate and adequate and for the moment enough.\n\nCaelan finished the candy and did not flinch at the generosity of a child who lives under a bridge giving a vampire sugar. He asked her with a care a man uses for dynamite and orphanages, \u201cAnise, does the ash write back if you feed it. Do you teach it letters.\u201d\n\nAnise tilted her head half-over and you could imagine her once being told not to spill by a woman who was still alive then and did not use a kind voice for instructions. She held out her hand and asked for Mara\u2019s with a glance that did not seek permission so much as to confirm a ritual. Mara stepped forward because the absence of fear is not a virtue, but refusing to perform it can be. Anise took Mara\u2019s ring-hand in both of hers and turned it, palm up, with a delicacy that made the ring feel shy. She blew on the metal once like cooling a spoon. She touched the ash line with the tip of her smallest finger and then touched the ring and then touched her tongue, which was either how she called a god or how she proved to herself that they are not always bright. The ash lifted again, less a word than a breath that had been waiting to speak since before the Charter had been a set of clauses and not a song.\n\n\u201cIt knows to knock,\u201d Mara said, and Anise\u2019s mouth made the shadow of a yes that didn\u2019t want the work of being a yes. Roe\u2019s note held the seam quiet this time the way a hand on the back of a child\u2019s neck says don\u2019t. Anise scattered three tiny cubes from the honey jar, sugar turned glass by a stove and a patience that had learned its edges burning itself. The ash made an O. Then a line. Then a lopsided spiral that made Kestrel whisper a profanity you only say when you realize the geometry you need is going to make your life longer and your sleep shorter.\n\n\u201cThe old script,\u201d Caelan said under his breath, and it sounded like a man reciting a catechism he pretended not to remember in case his mother were listening. \u201cNot the letter for door. The letter for threshold.\u201d\n\n\u201cDifference,\u201d said Ran, who had a family that had never in its history let a distinction die of neglect. \u201cA door belongs to the room. A threshold belongs to the house. You can break a door. You have to bribe a threshold.\u201d\n\nAnise touched Mara\u2019s wrist again, quick, like please don\u2019t look at this part in front of him. She made a motion with her head that could have meant leave or stay or bring me up where the air remembers the sky. Mara looked at Caelan and then at Kestrel and then at the ash and made a decision you could not revise once you made it. She nodded and said to Anise, \u201cWe\u2019ll go up. Your choice of stairs. Then you can teach me if I am to sing so the threshold decides it would like me enough to not tell its friends later that I was rude.\u201d\n\nThey found the easiest rung-ladder and took it like a prayer you don\u2019t believe but rattles along the inside of your teeth anyway. The street above was the kind with four languages on the signage and washing hung like flags that meant we have survived and intend to continue. The river smell argued with frying and both lost. Anise squinted once, which was a thing she did not do underground, and then put a hand in Kestrel\u2019s coat pocket without asking and came up with a piece of chalk Kestrel had not been aware of carrying because the city slips you tools when it wants to see what you will build. Anise wrote on the pavement a shape that would not have meant anything to a person from a place that had never heard what Quietites told themselves about stones. It looked like a house that had reconsidered and become a hand. It looked like a set of teeth that had not decided whether to smile.\n\nThree children stopped mid-chase and watched her write as if a cart had overturned and spilled sugar in front of them. A woman with her wrists deep in dough at a ground-floor window leaned out with her elbows, a childhood she hadn\u2019t realized she remembered appearing on her face and staying there without her permission. Pax, who had managed to arrive in spite of three mid-level executives with titles like Liaison attempting to intercept him so they could say they were useful to history by keeping it from being itself, kept his body where it looked theatrical to his enemies and supportive to his friends. The chalk made a sound like a small door opening in rooms where doors are only allowed to be decorative.\n\nAnise finished the shape and put her fingertip to her tongue again and grinned for real, evil and childish and proud. All it did was lighten the air for one second the way a window lightens when a bird flies past. If you hadn\u2019t been born here you would have missed it. If you had, you would remember it the way you remember that one day when you were six and someone you love laughed so loud you forgot to pretend to be shy.\n\n\u201cShow me what to sing at thresholds,\u201d Mara said, and Anise shook her head and pointed at Mara\u2019s mouth and then at her own and then at the chalk, which even Pax understood, which was that there are songs you write with breath and songs you write with your feet on stones. Anise took Mara\u2019s hand and placed it on the drawn threshold and pressed until Mara could feel the grit come up into her palm like words that had not been spoken because no one had the right last night. Mara listened. The listening took a piece from her. She gave it and did not ask for change. She hummed the vowel Soria had given her and moved it three inches right because Anise tapped her wrist and you do what you\u2019re told when a child who knows more than you do tells you to.\n\nThe chalk line did not glow because good magic in this city has terrible taste and refuses to make itself easy. It steadied. It felt like a floor deciding now would be an excellent time to hold.\n\nIn Annotations, Aron Tull sat at his desk and rolled a stamp across a bill of lading the way men smoke cigarettes when they are trying not to break a promise they made to themselves that morning. He looked up when the windows hummed, not with surprise but with that tired condescension some men think will keep magic from embarrassing them in front of their receipts. He had a file on his desk that said IVES, MARA\u2014CUSTODY: DECLARATION and he did not touch it because touching things makes them feel invited, and he had learned to be careful which invitations were written in his hands.\n\nIn Marrowgate, Lale set three staplers in a row and told a room full of men with very particular resentments that sentences were not accountable for the men who used them badly. She gave Silas a sheaf of notices that needed writing and a time by which they needed to be written, which is a form of love available in only a few rooms. When the hum came through the building like a thought someone had remembered in the middle of an argument and did not want to admit was a good one, she turned her head toward the wall and let her face do two or three things before she put the face back she used for keeping men from throwing their pens. Silas put his hand on the seam with the matter-of-factness of a man checking a fever in the dark and felt it hold instead of wanting something from him. He kept writing because he had found that you can be more than one man at once if the work is the kind that keeps your hands in one place.\n\nEdda took the pulp of the paper flower from the windowsill where it had dried into a stubborn, unattractive sheet and wrote a list on it, not because lists save the world but because lists on particular paper can be told what to do with their lives. Milk. Soap. Salt. A note to Soria that said Come by and bring me the gossip and I will feed you something you will pretend is not sweet. She folded the paper and did not think about the way her fingers learned a knot as she tied the string around it, a knot she had learned in a street when a man with a commendation pin had come to ask if her husband wanted to help the city be better and had not left until the soup was cold. She put the list in her pocket and went to the market with a determined normality that made three people on the stair rest their backs against the wall and breathe a breath they had not realized they were holding.\n\nBy late afternoon, when the glass buildings begin to believe they are lakes and everyone who has a pride makes the mistake of falling into it, the Division decided to stop pretending not to have noticed anything. They came to the south tunnels with the politeness of men trained to enter rooms without making the dust complain. Their inspector wore a coat with the peculiar, glossy grief of new leather and a badge that had not had time to learn its place on his chest. His name, like his tie, had been chosen by someone else and handed to him. He asked Caelan for access with sentences that had been approved by a lawyer who did not enjoy poetry. Caelan let him finish because he respected tactics and because refusing quickly is sometimes weaker than refusing slowly.\n\n\u201cThe tunnels are not the business of men who write reports unless invited,\u201d Caelan said, very politely, with the slight turn to the last word that made the inspector remember he had a stomach and a memory of being told not to go in water you could not see the bottom of. \u201cConsider this a partial invitation. You may look where we look. You will not touch where we would not.\u201d\n\nThe inspector made a note as if notes could force stone to become a paragraph. He said the word custodian because men in his building had decided to try it on the city\u2019s throat. Pax, who had arrived specifically to prevent that word from getting any more exercise than necessary, laughed softly as if someone had told a joke that should have been better, and said the Charter does not create custodians of voices any more than it creates owners of rivers. He offered the inspector a sweet, because sometimes sugaring a mouth prevents it from saying things badly. The inspector declined because he had eaten today already and would not be bought for less than an ambition.\n\nThey walked together to the place where Anise had taught the ash to mind its manners with sugar and patience and the lack of adult supervision that does real miracles. Anise was gone of course, not because she was afraid but because you do not leave a child in a room once you know which men have learned the way to it, not even a room with ashes trained to draw ovals instead of knives. The inspector knelt and sniffed and immediately tried to make his face not confess how much joy sugar can carry even when it is on stone. He drew a circle with his pen and the ash did not indulge him. Ran coughed into her hand and did not say you are not a woman with a chalk; the ash is not interested in your little thoughts.\n\nIt would have been a manageable day of measured confrontations and narrowly averted errors if the city had not decided to show off in the one way it knows how. At the tail end of evening, when even the river blinks slow, the door appeared again, not under the bridge or in a switchyard but propped with great courtesy against the newly whitewashed wall of a school where girls had learned to slap hands in rhythm that made boys on the other side of the fence wonder what game they were missing. It hummed with an amiable presumption that made the chalk in Mara\u2019s pocket vibrate against her leg. The custodians of that street were women with aprons and men with pennons because the school had a team that threw balls through rings and insulted other teams in songs they had learned from their grandmothers. They gathered at a curious, well-behaved distance around the door and did not touch it because touching things before you have decided whether you\u2019re in love with them is a habit this city tries to beat out of you early.\n\nCaelan came and did not touch it either. He put the back of his hand near the glass as if he might be asking it to be friends without asking for any of its time. The Girls\u2019 Principal, a woman with a neck like a column and a voice you didn\u2019t want to owe late homework to, folded her arms and said, \u201cIf that thing is going to ruin my wall, I will make a song out of its name and be very unkind to it.\u201d Pax promised her money for paint whether the wall needed it or not. The principal said she would take new balls and a better net, because girls need something to throw at where their aim is not suspected.\n\nAnise was there before any of them saw her, which is a trick only certain children learn and usually to their detriment. She touched the chalk line of threshold Mara had drawn that morning on a different street and moved it four finger-widths to the left, which would not have changed anything if the world were a place where precision was not magic. It changed everything there, the little bit that matters. The door\u2019s hum softened. Roe\u2019s note in Mara\u2019s mouth went still and then changed key not because Roe told it to but because the door had decided it would rather be a friend than an opening.\n\n\u201cWhatever is behind it likes us,\u201d Kestrel murmured, not comforted, exactly, by that fact. \u201cLet\u2019s not like it back until it pays rent.\u201d\n\nMara did not sing. She put her palm against the glass because sometimes you cannot expect a city to allow you to be clever when you can be honest. The ring made a small heat. She did not pull her hand away because she had learned last night that sometimes pain is a conversation. \u201cNot tonight,\u201d she said softly, because her throat had learned that sentence from a man who refused to use it lightly, and then, because she was not him and because she had been taught by Soria and because Anise had made a chalk house out of a hand, she added, \u201cBut come talk through the wall. We are tired of monologues. Teach me your question instead of pushing with it.\u201d\n\nNo one who had been to church wanted to write down what happened without cheapening it. The door did not open. The glass did not shatter. The hum took a more interesting shape. Mara felt along it the way you feel along a piano when you are learning which notes your grandmother sang when she did not know anyone was listening. She found there a sweetness that was not sugar and a stubbornness that was not ash. She felt a presence that was not a person and not not a person reading her hand the way women read fortunes and then looking up to see if her face belonged to the hand. It decided three things in a row about her and forgot the first two because the third was more interesting.\n\nSilas woke at the exact moment the hum changed and put his pen down and put his hand against the seam and felt the seam answer in a thickness that did not belong to stone. He spoke without saying anything because words would make a mess. Somewhere in a room without a wall, a door leaned toward the place his voice would be if his throat were allowed to be its own animal, and then leaned back because it had been taught caution by engineers long dead and girls who draw houses with chalk.\n\nThe Division\u2019s inspector wrote the words anomalous artifact in his book as if the book had asked for this sentence as a reward. He asked for the door to be taken into custody. The Girls\u2019 Principal made a sound that meant not while I am here. Pax asked him if he would like to be photographed saying the word custody at an object women and children were standing near with their palms open and their hands honest. Caelan noted how the shadow at the base of the frame lengthened in a way that belonged to a room that did not exist in the world and kept his body between the door and the crowd with a stillness that is what courage looks like before and after banners.\n\nAnise took Mara\u2019s wrist again and guided her hand down a fraction the way you show someone the proper placement of a thread through a needle. Mara let the hand-hum go slack and then taut and then slack again and the door\u2019s humming settled into a stave Roe would later be able to write down in a notation that would make other engineers happy and annoyed. The moment passed the way traffic passes and leaves you alone with the knowledge that all those other lives are going somewhere you can neither prevent nor assist.\n\nAfter, in the hush that always looks like a dignity but is actually relief being too tired to do anything else, Soria arrived carrying a towel and a bag of bread ends that had been soaking in milk and onions since yesterday. She took one look at the number of men whose mouths had opinions and the number of girls who had stopped pretending not to watch and said, as if she were introducing herself to a room full of misbehaving soap, \u201cWe will need bowls. We will need to sit down. We will need to make the street a kitchen now before it becomes a kind of theater worse than any we can write ourselves.\u201d\n\nThey did. The Girls\u2019 Principal had bowls because girls always need them; bread requires them and so does blood. Soria tore the bread and ladled stew and put a bowl in Mara\u2019s hands like a benediction and shoved another at the inspector so that he could not say the word custody with his mouth full. Caelan took one and ate with a soldier\u2019s gratitude, which is to say he ate as if he might not get to again and would not complain if someone interrupted him with a war. Pax ate and licked his thumb and said he could write a law that would codify bread in streets during incidents as a required line item, and Soria told him she would take his tie instead.\n\nWhen it was almost dark, when the ash under the bridge wrote O one more time and then forgot how to finish its second letter because a child somewhere was asleep, when a door had leaned and decided it would come back to find out whether anyone in this city knew how to answer a question without making it a sermon, when the Division had gone home and written a report they tried to convince themselves did not make them frightened in their suits, Mara stood with Anise at the edge of the water and let the river breathe on her face. Anise reached into the sack of sugar and drew a line on the stone so thin even the river pretended it didn\u2019t notice. She put the last hard candy from the box into Mara\u2019s mouth because there are certain favors between girls that do not require signatures. Mara let it break and let the sweetness hurt and then melt because survival is often a series of small decisions to let something dissolve rather than spit it out.\n\n\u201cYou could come home with me,\u201d Mara said softly, knowing what the answer was and saying it anyway because hospitality is not a trick; it is a vow that makes you bigger. Anise shook her head and looked in the direction of the old Baths and then the tunnels and then the bridge as if to say I am home in too many places to choose and your walls will feel narrow and you will think it is about me when it is about your walls. She tapped the ring and then tapped Mara\u2019s forehead in the exact place Edda tapped when she was trying to correct a thought without naming it. She pointed at Kestrel and mimed eyeliner with her thumb and forefinger and made a face that meant you need a wall with a mouth who can talk at men while you look for the seam, and then she laughed without sound and ran because running is still a freedom in this city and some girls refuse to be cured of it.\n\nNight came with its crooked halo and the city pretended for three hours that it was normal to hum through the windows of people who had done nothing to deserve it. The billboards failed again slowly in a way that made them endearing. The Lancers made the kind of jokes they make when the enemy is, for the moment, smarter than they want it to be. The Friends of Music wrote three notes on a wall and rubbed them away with steam so that only the tile remembered. Roe slept and dreamed of cats standing on knobs and refused to tell anyone because she would never be done being mortified by joy. The Lord Governor wrote citizen in a speech and for once did not cross it out. Aron Tull put his head in his hands in a room full of files and said aloud, to no one and to the part of himself that might yet be interesting, \u201cWe do not own doors,\u201d and then wrote it down because words make cowards brave when they believe they can read them later and pretend it was always their idea.\n\nEdda laid two spoons on the table and rolled her eyes when the cat pretended not to want to stand on the chair and then stood anyway with the innate rightness of cats. She tasted the stew and swore under her breath about lava and love. She listened for her daughter\u2019s step and felt the ring from across the room the way you feel thunder coming in your molars when you are old enough to have learned to count between flash and sound. She put a plate of bread under a dishcloth and said to the kitchen, which had never betrayed her and never would, \u201cIf the door wants in, it learns to knock. We are not barbarians.\u201d\n\nSilas wrote his three paragraphs and the joke Lale would like and a line on his own wall, in chalk, that would wash in the morning: I am not a door. He sat with his back to the seam and did not pretend to be brave, which made him more useful than he had been in years to something he could not name. He thought of a girl\u2019s ring tapping his forehead and what would have happened in a corridor if someone had knocked and someone else had answered instead of barging and ending.\n\nOn the parapet Caelan looked at the dark and thought about thresholds and the men he had lost who shouldn\u2019t have had to be brave that night, and the girls who built new vowels out of old chalk, and the way a door had behaved better than most men. He let the night stand next to him and did not ask it for anything and it liked him better for that. He thought that he would tell Mara tomorrow the names of every part of a bridge you never put on a map because men think bridges are simple and thus break them with confidence. He thought he would tell her what you paid and how to make sure you paid only once. Then he stopped thinking for a measured quarter hour and let his body count a rhythm that had nothing to do with drums or boots or the turnstiles in his ribs when he put on armor, and everything to do with the way a city breathes when it has been allowed to believe itself for one day.\n\nMorning would bring another audit, another door, another seam refusing to explain itself like a gallant. It would bring Deputy Pell counting her own mercy and Anise making a line thinner than a thought. It would bring Pax\u2019s tie being stolen and returned, and Soria\u2019s bath a degree too hot on purpose so that girls would remember their edges. It would bring an old boy with a broken shield writing a letter to a song he didn\u2019t like and didn\u2019t know how to live without. It would bring the river doing what rivers do, which is carry you away if you stand still and carry you away if you move. It would bring paint for the school wall because girls always win when paint is involved. It would bring the sovereign made of ash deciding if he could be offended by something that had not been meant for him and trying anyway. It would bring Edda cutting paper she had made into squares and drawing boxes in which to put the words she didn\u2019t intend to write, and then writing them and letting the cat judge her.\n\nFor the moment, there was breath. There was soup. There were doors that did not own you. There was sugar in stone and chalk under a child\u2019s fingernail and a ring behaving, for the space of a sleeping house, like jewelry. There were Lancers waiting to become monsters you could pray for again, which is the city\u2019s oddest blessing, and singers learning to say Not tonight with enough vowels to make it hold. There were bad men with paper flowers on their jackets going home to mirrors that could not be persuaded to become doors. There were good women with pockets with knives and tools and sweets, and their pockets will be written about later by clever men pretending they discovered them, and that will be fine because those men will be very entertained by their own work and the women will still be alive. There were names on walls and names in throats and names that were not yet names but would come when someone knocked and somebody else, for once, will deserve to be the one to answer.",
