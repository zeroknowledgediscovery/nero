     "novel_text": "The first time he saw the Capitol rise out of the fog like a ghost ship, Jack was ten and miserable in a too-tight shirt. His mother had dragged him and his sister to a school tour where a docent in a blue blazer explained that the building was designed by Jefferson, modeled after a Roman temple. He liked the way she said those things, the calm certainty, and he liked the ramp that let you roll a quarter downhill, sending it flickering like a startled fish into your palm. He didn\u2019t like the way his collar scratched his throat.\n\nYears later he learned that many truths came wrapped in scratchy collars. He learned to live with it.\n\nBy thirty-five the Capitol was simply there when he rose early and drove in with the news radio low, the river a black seam at the edge of the city, the lights on Ninth Street blinking yellow in the empty dawn. He stood some mornings at the back steps, drinking coffee that tasted like pennies, and watched stray cats slink along the brick. He nodded to custodians. He carried a leather portfolio his sister had given him when he\u2019d won the special election, as if the object could stitch him up into a certain man.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t certain.\n\n\u201cDelegate Crowder?\u201d The security guard with the bored eyes and gentle baritone called from the desk. \u201cYou forgot your badge yesterday. Again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, Warren,\u201d Jack said. He smiled that careful smile people had told him looked good in photos, surprised to find that, this morning, it also worked in his face. He clipped the badge to his lapel. In the low windows the white columns were faint through the trees, the steps worn smooth with all the wishful and angry feet.\n\nHe went upstairs. The office smelled like printer toner and clementines, because Mason had a habit of buying a huge bag of clementines in December and then eating them all by himself, leaving their skins curled like orange quotation marks in the trash.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Mason said without looking up. He was typing with two fingers. He always looked like this on a morning when Jack knew the day would be long\u2014shirt sleeves rolled twice, tie loosened, flinty eyes soft and over-caffeinated. The color in Mason\u2019s eyes was a thing you couldn\u2019t capture exactly; sometimes it was straight slate, sometimes it had a greenish halo, like the ring in the river where eddies formed around rocks. \u201cYou\u2019re early. Good. We\u2019ve got Ms. Pettigrew at eight\u2014bus routes again\u2014and then Channel 12 wants ten minutes before lunch on the tax credit. Also:\u201d here he finally looked up, fingers still on keys, face not careful at all, because with him it never needed to be, \u201cYour mother called. Twice.\u201d\n\n\u201cTerrible new development,\u201d Jack said. He set the coffee cup down on the desk, missing a stack of mail by a miracle. \u201cWe must legislate immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou going to call her back?\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter nine,\u201d he said, and took a breath, long like a swimmer. \u201cIf you remind me.\u201d\n\n\u201cReminding is literally my job,\u201d Mason said in the tone that somehow managed to be both caustic and fond. He slid an envelope across the desk. \u201cAlso, this.\u201d\n\nJack picked it up. The weight of certain kinds of paper. He knew what it was before he saw the letterhead: a donor who wished to remind him their generosity was tied to a specific vision of the world. He tucked it into the portfolio, feeling the heat rise in his face, replaced by the practiced cool. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk to them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk.\u201d\n\nMason nodded as if he had expected nothing else. He returned his gaze to the screen. He had that way of making quiet feel like some kind of pact.\n\nThey\u2019d met when they were kids, but not the way people tell it, not with a fistfight and a reconciliation, not with instant recognition. They had been assigned to the same table in middle school science, where the teacher kept a fish tank on the counter that made everyone have to pee. Mason had a notebook full of sloppy stars. Jack had a binder his mother had labeled for him. They shared a pizza on Fridays sometimes, in seventh grade, with three other boys who went on to light things on fire and get very good at throwing a football. They learned each other in layers, the way you learn the city. The place where the sidewalk buckled by the old elm. The alley with the sweet gum that dripped beads of amber. The tiny bakery that made a liar out of your budget and your intentions.\n\nHigh school tightened certain ways around them. Mason\u2019s father took off. Jack\u2019s father had already gone. They found each other at study hall and the smoking area they didn\u2019t smoke in and the decaying baseball diamond that no one\u2019s parents wanted to fix. They would lie on their backs and look at planes and tell each other lies. The lies were the seams inside truth: \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s just go,\u201d said with a laugh, said with the exact right amount of weight to let the words float.\n\nAfter college Jack had come back and worked as a policy analyst for a nonprofit until he was tired of writing other people\u2019s speeches. He saw the vacancy open when a longtime delegate shuffled into retirement, and it was like a shout inside him. He called Mason without thinking\u2014because that was the habit\u2014and Mason said, \u201cOkay, so, then you\u2019re going to run.\u201d\n\nThey were older but not old. Mason had been a reporter for a while, a midnight DJ for much longer, a bartender in a place whose lights were so dim your eyes turned to hands and felt their way around faces. He knew what people said when they thought no one important could hear them. He knew how to write sentences that were not pretty but would swing their weight at a crowd and hit something.\n\nOn the day Jack announced in Monroe Park, with brittle leaves and someone\u2019s dog barking absurdly at the statue of a horse without its rider, he felt the first small catch in his throat when he was trying to say the word \u201chome.\u201d He said it wrong. No one noticed. Mason did.\n\nAfter that, the years flattened and stretched like roads. Jack learned posture and patience and which elevators could be counted on to shut without trying to crush you. He learned he could live with sleep in six small doses and that, sometimes, compromise meant you got something instead of nothing. He also learned that Mason had three different smiles: the good one, where his left dimple crumpled, the fake one he used when he was so tired of someone he would rather eat paper than listen, and the small one he kept like a secret, which showed exactly one tooth and made Jack want to leave the room, just in case anyone could see the way it wrecked him.\n\nHe could have said that last part out loud, some nights, in the elevator that carried them down to where the cars waited like obedient animals, or in the corner booth at Millie\u2019s where the waitress knew that Mason would ask for extra hot sauce and that Jack would pick broccoli out of his omelet. He held it instead like a coin in his mouth. He held it until it melted, until he couldn\u2019t tell if it was the coin that burned or his tongue.\n\nThe day moved like any other. It was winter, which in Richmond meant a sympathizer\u2019s cold \u2014willing, but not committed. Ms. Pettigrew arrived composed and trembling, because she was like that, because she had grandchildren who waited forty-five minutes for one bus and then had to sprint to catch the transfer to the second. She wore a church hat. She never took the hat off, but she took off each fact and set it on the desk: times, intersections, dates. Mason leaned forward and asked questions like he was building a small bridge.\n\nLater, when she left, flattening a gloved hand on Jack\u2019s as if to anchor him to her insistence, Jack stood in the doorway watching the hallway fill with staffers, lobbyists, school groups with bright lanyards. He felt it then: love as the pressure at the center of his chest. Not the love that made headlines, not the love his donors put on brochures with soft-focus families on the cover. The kind of love that made him say yes to sitting in rooms where people talked themselves into circles, just to pull the line straight again. The kind that made him look at Mason and see\u2014he refused the word fate, because he\u2019d been taught to be suspicious of easy language. But. But.\n\n\u201cYou had the pivot, but you didn\u2019t take it,\u201d Mason said, coming to stand beside him, shoulder just not touching the frame of the door, the smell of clementines threaded through like an indecent thought.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Jack said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll take it next time,\u201d Mason said. He meant it like he meant all things\u2014with accuracy, with confidence that could be mistaken for cruelty if you didn\u2019t know him. Jack had known him long enough to see the shadow of fear behind that confidence. He had known him long enough to keep it a secret.\n\n\u201cLunch?\u201d Jack said.\n\n\u201cAt noon we\u2019re doing ten with Channel 12\u2014don\u2019t say the word fairness; they\u2019ll trap you with it\u2014and then I guess we can do lunch if by lunch you mean protein bars and a shared bag of chips.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou used to dream,\u201d Jack said.\n\n\u201cI upgraded. I dream in bullet points. It\u2019s very efficient.\u201d\n\nWhen the camera crew arrived, and the reporter\u2014thin jacket, chapped cheeks\u2014asked her questions and then asked the question that was not on the list, about the rumor that a certain caucus would withhold support, Jack did the thing he was good at: He stood very still. He did not blink too fast. He acknowledged the premise. He gave the pivot Mason had placed under his tongue like a communion wafer. He smiled just so. Later, in the car, he let his head slide against the fogged window and whispered, \u201cI lied.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou avoided a trap,\u201d Mason said. \u201cEvaded. Boy-scouted your way around it. Can we drop you at the committee room? I\u2019ve got to run across town to the school board office and will swing back before the caucus meets.\u201d\n\nJack nodded, and Mason turned the radio low. The air between them hummed the way it always did when they had gotten through something all right. The peace after a fight won in the last yard. The humming same as summer cicadas, only colder.\n\n\u201cYou want to stop at the river later?\u201d Mason said as they idled at a light. \u201cAfter. It\u2019s a day for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always say that,\u201d Jack said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always true.\u201d\n\nHe thought of the river as the place their friendship lived in its purest form. As if something in them ran exactly that way\u2014fast and slow at once, threaded silk suddenly frothing, rocks that looked like whales when you were young. Boys had jumped there with terrible bravado. Another boy had broken his arm. Boys, when they were trying to be men, had gone there to kiss men in the dark and then returned to their girlfriends with abject, certain hands. Jack had not been that boy. He had been, he tells himself, careful. But the river knew him anyway. It knew his ankles and his compromises, his way of saying yes too many times in a row and then being washed out by the sudden word no.\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMaybe is a yes that needs a nap,\u201d Mason said, and then the light turned and they went.\n\nIn the committee room, a delegate with a mustache like a small animal lectured the room about sin in the tones of a man who hid a picture of himself in a drawer that would be embarrassing to show his grandson. Jack nodded when people spoke and wrote in the margins: Look up numbers. He wasn\u2019t always the thing he performed. He knew the shapes people required, but he wanted to know what the numbers did when they ran into each other, what the lines did when they crossed in the middle like a kiss.\n\nWhen he was done, when the afternoon was thinner and the sun low in the slats of the blinds, he went back to the office. Mason was there on the floor, cross-legged in his tie, papers spread like an unruly deck of cards, phone under his chin. He was trying, Jack could tell, to persuade someone not to do something stupid to themselves in public. His voice had that brightness like the rim of a glass, almost too sharp. \u201cI hear you,\u201d he was saying, making a small motion at Jack to sit. \u201cBut we both know\u2014no, we do know, come on, I\u2019ve known you since you were beating me at community trivia nights, which is to say I know you hate this idea.\u201d Then: \u201cUh-huh. Okay. Okay. Give me an hour and then I\u2019ll call you back.\u201d He smiled, the smallest one. He ended the call with a soft exhale like he\u2019d just stepped off a curb without falling.\n\n\u201cWho was that?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone who wants to make a statement outside the caucus dinner that would probably solve their short-term problem and set their car on fire long-term. We\u2019re going to fix it with pie.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou believe in pie a lot,\u201d Jack said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because pie is one of the only true things left to us in this world. Also, they make a chocolate chess you\u2019d leave me for.\u201d\n\nJack was silent. He looked at the curve of Mason\u2019s wrist where the cuff had slipped back, and he thought something unprintable. He said, instead, \u201cI\u2019m never leaving you.\u201d\n\nMason looked up, quickly, face opened. Not opened like hope. Opened like a reflex, like surprise that hurt. \u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause who would tell you when you\u2019re about to sound like a person who has never met an actual human? Who would keep clementines in season and almonds when they\u2019re not?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho indeed,\u201d Jack said, and the room seemed to tilt, just a degree, like a boat catching a new current. He set his portfolio down very carefully on the desk, then needed to put his hands somewhere. He slid them into his pockets. He could feel the coin he\u2019d carried for years: the marble one from the dome. He rolled it with his thumb until the edges gave him a map.\n\nThey went to the dinner, which was fluorescent and acrid and full of the kind of earnest conversation that wears you out. They steered a man toward pie and obscurity. They stood in a hallway with a woman from the teachers\u2019 union and promised not to forget her. When the crowd thinned and the chairs were exhausted and a janitor began stacking them with a bored clang, Mason looked at him and tilted his chin toward the door.\n\n\u201cNow?\u201d Jack said.\n\n\u201cNow.\u201d\n\nThey drove to the river, to the place below the bridge where the rocks lay like cows in a pasture. The air cut his cheeks when he got out. He was suddenly aware of all the ways he had learned to move through rooms and how none of those movements worked here. The river made everyone awkward again. It was good that way.\n\nThey walked until the path narrowed and then widened and the graffiti on the concrete feasted on color. PURPLE SKUNKS FOR GOV. Names and dates, lovers exalting their perfect and temporary graffiti selves, someone who had drawn a cartoon of a possum with a crown. Mason touched the crown and laughed. Maybe he said something. The river louded, made words optional.\n\nOn the rocks the cold ran up through the soles of their shoes, insisting. They sat with their knees taken away from each other at first, then closer, then aligned like they had always been built to stack just so.\n\n\u201cSometimes I think about what you\u2019d be doing if you hadn\u2019t run,\u201d Mason said. The sky made a soundless declaration of winter above them. \u201cProbably you\u2019d be running something else.\u201d\n\n\u201cA bagel shop,\u201d Jack said.\n\n\u201cGod, you\u2019d be the worst bagel shop owner. You\u2019d give away everything. Here, ma\u2019am, take these bagels, take my shirt, take my\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Jack said, laughing, both hands up. \u201cStop before we lose all our points with heaven.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost too late for you anyway,\u201d Mason said, then looked at him, eyes not flinty now but wet silver. He wanted, Jack thought, to say a thing and didn\u2019t know how to land it. He watched the thought float around Mason\u2019s head like a drunk moth. He waited for it to land on his sleeve.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Mason said, and lay back on the rock. He stared up as if there were an answer there. \u201cJust. The way you carry this with your whole body. Sometimes I think: put it down, Jack. Let me pick it up for a while. I\u2019m strong enough. I don\u2019t mind the weight.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean the district? Do you mean the world?\u201d He wanted to add Do you mean me.\n\nMason squinted. \u201cYes. Also no. Stop making me define my terms.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were a reporter,\u201d Jack said. \u201cIt\u2019s literally your job.\u201d\n\nMason huffed. \u201cI was a terrible reporter. I fell in love with too many people.\u201d He threw an arm over his eyes. \u201cNot like that. Not like that,\u201d he said again quickly, voice sudden as a scraped knee. \u201cJust. Everyone looked so like someone who was going to outsmart their life, and then.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then,\u201d Jack said, because he knew how that sentence ended.\n\nThey were both quiet. The river did its old work. A runner passed, breath a ghost behind him. Somewhere a child insisted on being carried and was refused and then was carried. Jack pulled his coat tighter. He knew what he wanted to say. It was there like a dark fruit hanging just above reach. He could stand. He could reach. He could break off the stem and eat and let it stain him.\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d he began, and Mason turned his face toward him, and Jack lost the second half of the sentence wholly and without hope. He switched lanes. \u201cWe should revisit the transit language. You were right about the verb. It should be expand, not enhance. Enhance sounds like what you do to a photo of a sandwich.\u201d\n\nMason let out a breath he had been holding. \u201cGod, yes,\u201d he said, laughing from relief. He sat up, shivering a little. \u201cI knew we were in trouble. You almost said something like \u2018synergy.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI would never.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have.\u201d\n\nJack made a face. \u201cI would never on purpose.\u201d\n\nThey walked back under the bridge. Mason\u2019s shoulder bumped his and then didn\u2019t. There are whole languages of touch that never need a grammar. On the way up to the lot, Mason fished in his coat. \u201cI think I\u2019ve got another clementine,\u201d he said, and came up triumphant, the tiny orange the color of a child\u2019s toy. He held it up. \u201cFor you or for me?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor you,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou stole the last cookie at that meeting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was a cracked cookie,\u201d Mason said, already peeling. \u201cCracked cookies aren\u2019t real cookies. They\u2019re ethics assignments with sugar.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways with the ethics,\u201d Jack said, quiet, too quiet, because the word caught at something. It scraped on something that had been smooth only because of careful sanding down.\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Mason\u2019s eyes were on him. Immediate. That commonness between them like a shared coat.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Jack said automatically, then took the clementine piece Mason offered. It burst in his mouth, too sweet. He swallowed. He breathed. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said again, and felt both the truth and the lie of it in his chest, like a coin rolling in a bowl.\n\nHis mother called again that night. He answered and leaned in the kitchen door with his forehead against the cool painted wood and listened as she told him about the neighbor\u2019s new fence, which was an abomination, and the recipe she had tried that would be better if you doubled the garlic. She asked, only once, if he was eating, if he was sleeping. He said yes to both, because these were the easy lies, because these were the lies that kept people from crying on the phone. He thought of the hat Ms. Pettigrew had not removed. He thought of the weight of envelopes. He thought of the river making a covenant with itself to return to the sea.\n\nWhen he hung up, the apartment was quiet in the way that meant someone else had just turned off their TV and the building was acclimating to the new lack. He poured a glass of water and drank half and left the glass on the counter with a ring of sweat like a lesson. He sat at the little table not quite big enough for company and took the marble coin from his pocket and set it on the wood. He never told anyone where he got it. He never told anyone who he wanted to be when he held it tight.\n\nMason texted: \u201cYour answers tonight were clean. You probably saved us three thousand phone calls.\u201d\n\nHe typed and deleted. He typed and deleted. He typed: \u201cYou did all the work.\u201d\n\nMason wrote: \u201cWe\u2019re a team. Don\u2019t go soft on me after midnight.\u201d\n\nJack stared at that. The words were not romantic ones. They weren\u2019t even kind in the way people recognized. But his heart pulled in his chest as if someone had tied a ribbon and yanked. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBreakfast with Wyatt?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Mason wrote. \u201cThe place on Broad. Also the city\u2019s pretending it might snow. You might have to be photographed in a very serious coat.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay God grant me the composure to resist the serious coat picture.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnlikely,\u201d Mason wrote. \u201cSleep. For once.\u201d\n\nHe turned his phone facedown and then couldn\u2019t stand it and turned it faceup again, as if it were a body he had to be certain kept breathing. He wanted to write the thing\u2014he always wanted to write the thing. He wanted to say, with that scary plainness he admired in the hard women from Gillies Creek who didn\u2019t ask anyone\u2019s permission to speak: I am the man who waits for your text even when I\u2019m sitting across from you. I am the man who thinks of you when he hears the garbage truck. I am the one who wants to take your tie off and fold it because I know you\u2019ll wad it in your pocket and ruin it. He wanted to say it and he wanted to turn off his phone and walk into a different life.\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d he told himself, not for the first time. He had a voice he used on himself that was both his own and not. \u201cStop and go to bed.\u201d\n\nIn the morning, the city was doing that hesitant winter thing where it threatened snow and then didn\u2019t deliver, the air chalky with intent. He dressed in a dark suit and the scarf his sister had given him for Christmas that had been chosen by his niece and therefore had small embroidered whales on the ends. He liked the whales. They made people smile and then give him more of themselves than they meant to.\n\nAt Wyatt\u2019s, with the clatter and the heavy smell of butter and coffee, they slid into a booth. The waitress came and smacked down two mugs like cards. \u201cSugar?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAlways,\u201d Mason said. \u201cBring us whatever you think we deserve.\u201d\n\nShe snorted and left. Mason had that effect on service professionals: they either adored him or tried to murder him with their eyes. \u201cWe should get ahead of the property tax thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going away, even if it\u2019s dumb. Also, be prepared: I heard there\u2019s a rumor about you and that yoga instructor from Carytown.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no yoga instructor from Carytown,\u201d Jack said.\n\n\u201cI know that and you know that but some people need their lies to come with mats.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d Jack said, the word too sharp. \u201cWho\u2019s spreading it?\u201d\n\nMason waved a hand. \u201cIrrelevant. We starve it. Don\u2019t give it air. We say, \u2018His schedule doesn\u2019t allow for yoga,\u2019 and then we talk about potholes. People like potholes. They can see them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a genius,\u201d Jack said.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m an old bartender,\u201d Mason said. \u201cPeople tell me what they really want when they think I\u2019m not staring.\u201d\n\nThe door chimes tinkled. A councilman they both knew nodded at them and then made a show of ignoring them demonstrably. Jack felt the fatigue slide into his bones. Politicians were like actors who refused to break character while they were buying detergent. It was exhausting even to watch.\n\n\u201cWhat was the thing you almost said last night?\u201d Mason asked abruptly, setting his mug down too hard, sloshing coffee, and then reaching for napkins with the frantic precision of a man who refuses to stain.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou almost said something and then you said \u2018transit verbs\u2019 and saved us both. What was it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Jack said, and his tone betrayed him, that thing he couldn\u2019t quite file off no matter how he smoothed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything.\u201d\n\nMason didn\u2019t lean in, didn\u2019t push. He looked past Jack to the window where an old man was arguing lovingly with his dog. His jaw worked the way it did when he couldn\u2019t decide whether to fight or make a joke. He chose the joke. \u201cWell, if it was a compliment about my hair, you can save it. I already know I\u2019m a tragic figure in winter humidity.\u201d\n\nJack laughed and dissolved and refused himself. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about your hair,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was about\u2014\u201d\n\nTheir waitress arrived with a plate of biscuits and the decision was carried away on the smell of butter and smoke.\n\nThe days stacked. The colors changed in the windows. They lived inside the rhythm that kept them together without saying the name of it. Jack learned to disappear into the crowd and be seen. He learned which elevators were for someone else. He learned that every time Mason brushed past him in the hall he felt the heat coordinate his muscles into readiness, some part of him living six inches to the left of his body, where touch was an event and not a theory.\n\nThere were nights. There were the nights when they went to community meetings in rooms that smelled like old trophies and heard men stand and say the word \u201ctransparency\u201d like it was a hymn. There were the nights when someone cried in a folding chair, when someone sat very still with folded hands because they had been taught from birth not to take up space and could not unlearn it at thirty-six. There were the nights they went to a neighborhood on the south side where the streetlights did not exist in a hopeful sense, and they walked, and a boy in a black hoodie said, \u201cYo, that your man?\u201d with a grin like a dare. Jack said, \u201cHe is,\u201d too quickly, and Mason looked at the ground and grinned to himself and threw his empty coffee cup into a trash can from five feet away and missed.\n\nThere was a night the power went out and the city screamed, not from terror but annoyance, and they worked by lamplight in his apartment, and the lamplight made Mason\u2019s face look like a painting you might find in an attic, something someone loved and hid. He fell asleep on the sofa, one arm thrown over his head, his mouth at an angle that made him look young. Jack watched him because he couldn\u2019t not. He covered him with a blanket. He sat there on the opposite chair and let the room go quiet around them, and the only sound was the tick of the building settling into itself and Mason\u2019s even sleeping breath, and something loosened that would not be tightened again.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said into the lamplight, meaning very many things. The lamp didn\u2019t answer, having the good sense not to.\n\nIn the morning, Mason woke and scolded him for not sleeping and made eggs in a pan that was too small, and the smell lifted his heart and broke it.\n\nA week later, Jack stood in front of a little TV camera to talk about the tax credit again and he could see in the periphery that Mason had chosen the tie he always told him made him look like he had a plan. He held his place in the script without looking. He said the number. He said it again. He smiled and said, \u201cWe can do better,\u201d and watched the anchor\u2019s face bend to the shape of that hope and had the inappropriate thought that maybe he could live in this in-between forever, that maybe he could live in the long hallway where he did not say and Mason did not ask.\n\nHe knew that wasn\u2019t how this went. He knew, in his bones, that the hallway ended. He could not see the door yet. It was there anyway.\n\nAfter they packed up that day, after the papers went back into their folders and the coffee cups went to die in the recycling bin that didn\u2019t later recycle anything, Mason leaned in the door and said, abruptly, as if it hurt, \u201cYou know I love you, right?\u201d\n\nIt was a joke made in a tone that one might use to tell a dog it was beautiful. It was both a joke and not. Jack looked up. The room stretched very far away from him. The floor became a field, the windows open to winter. He said, without thinking, \u201cI know,\u201d which was the right and wrong answer, which was the only thing he could have said without making the ceiling come down with too much honesty.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Mason said, and looked down at his hands as if they had embarrassed him. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want you to forget.\u201d\n\n\u201cForget?\u201d The word was too strange on his tongue. \u201cHow would I\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mother always liked me better,\u201d Mason said, and there it was: the dodge, wearing a bright little hat. He pushed off the door frame. \u201cI\u2019m going to get you a salad you won\u2019t eat.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet me something real,\u201d Jack said, but his heart was making a noise he didn\u2019t recognize. \u201cGet me a cookie.\u201d\n\n\u201cCracked cookie,\u201d Mason said over his shoulder. \u201cEthics assignment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhole cookie, then,\u201d Jack called, and the door clicked shut like a day finishing.\n\nHe sat for a second in the fluttering silence, papers sighing faintly. He could feel everything he had not said standing there in the room, looking out the window, checking their phones. He could feel the river moving under the floorboards.\n\nHe picked up a pen. He wrote the word expand on a sticky note. He stuck it to the corner of the computer, pale yellow with his slanted, overly careful letters. He could have written a thousand words that afternoon and none of them would have been the one he needed.\n\nThat night, when the cold was real for once and the prediction of snow came through as an honest, hesitant dusting, he walked home. He could have called for a ride, but he wanted the walk, the way it let his brain unwind, his shoes making civilized small noises on the sidewalk. A woman passed him with a baby zipped into her coat like a kangaroo. He said hello. She said, \u201cStay warm, baby,\u201d and he felt the startling goodness of strangers wash him.\n\nThe city changed when it pretended to be someplace else, transformed by weather into a town out of a movie where people got stuck on trains and had to kiss before dawn. He turned at the corner where there was a mural of a woman who looked like someone\u2019s aunt, hair rolled just so, laughing into a sun that did not need to be real to give them light. He walked up three flights. He turned his key. He stood in the doorway, listening to his apartment remember it was his.\n\nHe thought of the workshop he had taken once\u2014how he had needed it like a hamster needs a wheel, busy but not necessary\u2014where the teacher had said, \u201cThe first chapter is the whole book in miniature,\u201d and he had rolled his eyes because he was not twenty and could not afford the earnestness of absolutes. He thought, now, standing barefoot on his kitchen tile, of that certainty. He thought: It is all here. The city and the cold and the boy who said I know and the boy who said good and the river. The river under everything. He poured himself a glass of water and drank it, and drank it, and then set the empty glass next to the first, collected evidence.\n\nHe slept. He dreamed in bullet points and whales and the chalky taste of snow. He woke and watched the light move slow around the edges of the blinds and thought, for a second, this is the day I will choose to be brave. Then his phone vibrated like a heart and the day was the day, was the day, was only a day again, asking him the usual things\u2014show up, speak, smile, lift, carry, compromise.\n\nMason texted: \u201cThere\u2019s an early hearing on the zoning thing. Can you be there? Also wear the serious coat. It\u2019s your destiny.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy destiny is my nose getting red,\u201d Jack wrote.\n\n\u201cThen destiny shapeshifts,\u201d Mason wrote. \u201cBring tissues. You always forget.\u201d He added a photograph he had taken and not meant to\u2014Jack laughing, head tipped back, eyes closed, the river behind him a slow band of polished pewter. It wasn\u2019t a good photo, technically; it was crooked and the light was allergic to flattery and Jack wanted to rip it off his screen and shove it into his chest and carry it around until it bent. He didn\u2019t know whether to be grateful or furious. He wrote, carefully: \u201cWhen did you take that?\u201d\n\n\u201cLast week,\u201d Mason said. \u201cYou were saying something mean about bacon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would never,\u201d Jack wrote. He thought to say it. He thought to say it for real, openly, with both hands. He was not brave today either. He wrote: \u201cYou\u2019re a menace,\u201d which, between them, already meant: Stay. Which already meant: Don\u2019t go too far away. Which already meant the thing he couldn\u2019t say.\n\nHe put on the serious coat. He went downstairs. He breathed the air, clean and hurtful, and watched his breath go up like a suggestion. He walked toward the Capitol that lifted behind the trees like a memory of a promise, and he thought: maybe the second chapter will be easier, which he knew was a lie, which he said anyway, because he believed in small mercies, in temporary hope, in getting through the day without breaking. In clementines in winter. In whole cookies when you had earned them and when you had not.\n\nBefore the hearing, standing by the window while the clerk arranged papers that would be mislaid by lunch, Mason came to stand too close at his elbow. They watched a white dog gallop unsupervised across the snowy lawn, delighted with its own ungovernable motion. \u201cThat\u2019s you,\u201d Mason said. \u201cThat dumb dog. So pleased to be alive he forgets to look where he\u2019s going.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re the guy yelling at the dog to come back.\u201d\n\nMason made the small smile. \u201cI\u2019m the guy carrying the leash and pretending it\u2019s not mine.\u201d He bumped Jack\u2019s arm with his once, twice. The motion was nothing and everything. \u201cLet\u2019s give them the better verb,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s do the boring thing and call it a win, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Jack said carefully, because it was all he could do. He didn\u2019t look at Mason. He did not move his arm away.\n\nThe hearing was the hearing. People mispronounced his name and then apologized. People said his name with love as if it would soften the thing they wanted. He made his voice lower because people listen more when a low voice tells them what they needed was already what they wanted. He left the hearing more awake and more tired than when he had arrived, which was the default. They walked out together at noon and the sun was making treacherous promises with the snow.\n\n\u201cYou eating?\u201d Mason asked.\n\n\u201cIs this real lunch or ethics lunch?\u201d\n\n\u201cReal lunch, for once, if we can get to it. If you answer any calls in the next twenty minutes I\u2019ll glue your phone to a pigeon and let it fly into the river.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like how you think my phone is capable of flight.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is capable of flight under the right conditions,\u201d Mason murmured, not really to him, maybe to himself. He watched the woman with the baby at the bus stop pull the blanket higher. \u201cYou know that. You always knew.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre we talking about physics or hope?\u201d Jack said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about wanting things,\u201d Mason said softly. He rubbed his thumb along the seam of his coat pocket, the motion tiny and frantic. He looked down at their shoes. He went on in a voice like a neutral news anchor would use to deliver a devastating piece of information about an earthquake: \u201cI need to tell you something and I don\u2019t know how to do it without sounding like a headline.\u201d\n\nJack felt the air leave. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, and he was smiling, and it wasn\u2019t a practiced smile, it was the kind of smile you make when someone pushes you into a pool and you\u2019re pretending you didn\u2019t just swallow chlorinated water.\n\n\u201cNot now,\u201d Mason said, rolling his eyes at himself. \u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014it can wait. It shouldn\u2019t, but it can. Lunch first. Then ruin something.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Jack said, because ruin sounded like an honest word, and he preferred those. He matched his pace to Mason\u2019s, which was not a thing he admitted to doing aloud, and they moved along the sidewalk together, briefly in step, briefly without the push and pull of the building behind them, briefly only two men in coats, the world flecked with white, the river invisible and nevertheless under their feet, running on and on toward the mouth where it would be lost and find itself again.They chose lunch at the place with the plastic plants and the slow-circling ceiling fans that made every conversation sound like it had been softened with a thumb. It was the kind of restaurant that had been itself for so long it was impervious to trends, the kind where the waitress addressed them as \u201cyou two\u201d and refilled their water without being asked. Mason ordered the stew that stained your lips if you weren\u2019t careful. Jack ordered a grilled cheese like a child because he was exhausted enough to want to be taken care of and because he\u2019d learned that sometimes you got stronger if you let yourself be small for a minute. The windows were fogged in at their edges where the snow outside auditioned for real weather and failed charmingly. Mason took off his coat but left his scarf looped, an uncharacteristic indecision he disguised by joking with the waitress about the way the word plantain made people confess their childhoods.\n\nThey did the first ten minutes the way they always did, in a litany that anchored them to the ordinary. There were committee rumors and a water main break on Leigh Street and a man who had written four emails at midnight explaining how taxes were unconstitutional because of his reading of Leviticus. They were careful, like people stepping around a hole in the floor they knew was there because they had made it together and covered it with a rug. Jack asked if the school board had stopped making pronouncements on social media and tightened the lid on his temper so that it only steamed and didn\u2019t lift. Mason made three small, accurate predictions about a reporter\u2019s angles that would save them both two hours later. The stew arrived. The sandwich came with fries that tasted of something like paprika and heat, and he was grateful for them like a man is grateful for a blanket on a church pew during a winter funeral.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not one thing,\u201d Mason said finally, when the food had made the first pass through their systems and the waitress had left without judgment. He had been watching his hands as if he needed a teleprompter in his palm. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem. The headline wants it to be one thing, but the copy is crowded. It\u2019s like a school bus at three-thirty. Everyone\u2019s sticky and yelling and carrying a trumpet.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to let me on the bus anyway,\u201d Jack said. He kept his voice even, patient in the way he reserved for other people\u2019s fear because he had learned to be decent in that specific way, and because he had gotten good at it from practice. \u201cGive me the headline you don\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nMason opened his mouth to answer, and then his phone lit up and the light from it cut his face into halves. He swore softly, and even his swears had a weather system. \u201cIt\u2019s Ms. Pettigrew,\u201d he said. \u201cI told her to call if they were delayed again. I didn\u2019t think she meant today.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnswer it,\u201d Jack said. He could feel his own body shift into the muscle memory of moving toward a problem, even when moving meant sitting still to listen. The stew breathed steam into the air like a horse in winter, and he watched Mason\u2019s eyes change shape as he listened, flattening into a focus he loved because it was almost the same as tenderness.\n\n\u201cShe says the crosstown bus is hung up at Lombardy because of the plows, and a driver let them out to walk to the transfer and her grandson fell and cracked his chin,\u201d Mason said, phone pressed to his ear with his shoulder, writing on the back of a receipt with the pen the waitress had left. \u201cNo one is hurt-hurt, but she\u2019s mad enough to file a lawsuit against the entire system and the sky.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll call Operations,\u201d Jack said, already reaching for his own phone. \u201cWe\u2019ll get someone to meet her at the stop with a kit, and we\u2019ll ask the route manager to explain why they decided to ignore the contingency plan they told me they had in writing.\u201d\n\nThey divided and did it, the way they always divided and did it, a small choreography performed with their napkins in their laps. Jack threaded his voice down the line into the place where decisions were made and asked that the people who were always a little sidelined be made central for an hour. He didn\u2019t shout. He didn\u2019t accuse. He said, \u201cHelp me,\u201d and the dispatcher on the other end, who had a cousin who had once danced with Jack\u2019s sister at a wedding, said, \u201cI will.\u201d Mason spoke to Ms. Pettigrew until she was laughing in her own grudging way, which was to say she agreed to be angry again later when it would be more useful. He arranged for a school nurse to meet them at the transfer point with a butterfly bandage that would have to stand in for a better world.\n\nWhen he hung up, Mason set the pen down carefully so it wouldn\u2019t roll. He looked at Jack with his mouth a little open, like someone who had walked up a long hill and was trying to look fine. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him you were the delegate,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou said your name like it was just your name.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes it works better,\u201d Jack said, and tried to make his grin a modest thing instead of the pride that wanted to leap up and flash its teeth. \u201cSometimes people just need a person and not a title.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Mason said, and rubbed the bridge of his nose like he was smoothing a crease in a bedsheet. \u201cOkay. Where were we. Crammed copy. Headline I hate.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive it to me,\u201d Jack said again, and then the door opened and a gust of cold came with a man who had been a mentor to Jack\u2019s mentor and liked to tell stories about the days when politeness governed men like a religion. The man\u2019s hair had been a work of engineering when Jack was a kid. Now it was a bright, marvelous white that made him look like a dandelion that meant to grant your wish whether you deserved it or not. He saw Jack, made himself surprised in a way that was both theater and kindness, and came over with his hand extended.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you two look industrious,\u201d he said, performing magnanimity because he had discovered years ago it fit him as well as anything else. \u201cCrowder, my boy, I keep hearing your name in sentences that sound like congratulations and worry. That means you\u2019re doing something.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to do the boring thing and call it a win,\u201d Jack said, which made the old man bark a laugh and clap him on the shoulder like he had been waiting to be given back that joke since his own first term.\n\n\u201cKeep at it,\u201d he said, his gaze flicking to Mason and softening with the kind of appreciation he reserved for people who did not need to be told they were essential but deserved to hear it all the same. \u201cYou taking care of him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI try,\u201d Mason said, the smile he wore the size of a playing card. \u201cIt\u2019s a two-man job.\u201d\n\nAfter the old man left, eels of other obligations swam up around them. Texts strung beads between their phones. A staffer appeared at the window and made eyebrows at Jack until he looked. The waitress dropped the check and said, \u201cDon\u2019t tip me with pennies, sugar,\u201d and smiled in a way that made him wonder whether telling the truth in small things had trained him for the bigger trying truths he still refused to set loose. They paid. They gathered their coats. At the door, Mason put his hand on Jack\u2019s elbow to steer him around a boy whose boots looked like they were older than he was, and Jack felt that touch like news.\n\nOn the walk back, the streets were that winter gray that could be either elegant or a threat depending on whether the wind decided to harass you. The snow had thinned into sugar on the grass. Traffic hissed wetly, the sound of cars discovering they weren\u2019t invincible. By the statue of the woman with the book on her lap, a man in a suit talked into his earbud and apologized to someone he loved for something he\u2019d meant to do and hadn\u2019t. Jack breathed in the cold and out the steam and counted five streetlights in a row that needed replacing. Mason walked with his hands in his coat pockets the way he did when he was trying not to smoke, which he didn\u2019t do anymore except in his head.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let me run from this,\u201d Mason said in a voice that pretended they were in the middle of a conversation and not at the edge of a cliff. \u201cI\u2019ve been training for avoidance my whole life. I can make a detour look like a destination.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can wait,\u201d Jack said, and discovered he meant it with a patience that might have looked like nobility if you didn\u2019t also see the cowardice stitched into its lining. \u201cIf you need the right place to say it.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight place,\u201d Mason repeated, as if the words were a map he was suspicious of. He laughed very quietly. \u201cOkay. Not in front of a statue and a man having a public apology, then.\u201d\n\nThe afternoon folded them up, as afternoons did. There were decisions to be nudged and a meeting that produced a sentence they would use thirty-seven times in the next month until it felt like chewing cardboard and something inside it still, obstinately, nourished. He called his mother from the stairwell and she told him to stop wearing suits like a funeral director\u2019s. He nodded and promised and didn\u2019t change anything. Mason left for forty minutes and came back with cheeks made red by weather and a pie in a box that perfumed the entire office. He set it on the file cabinet like a shrine. They fed sugar to three people who had come close to making public mistakes. They kept the mistakes private and exacted the quiet debt those rescues always cost, payable in support when a bill came down the line that needed a skeleton.\n\nClose to dusk, which was early and fierce the way it is when winter has been pretending all day that she\u2019s not serious and then remembers she is, they stood shoulder to shoulder at the window again. The dog who had galloped earlier had either learned obedience or had been leashed by someone with a stern voice and warm pockets. The dog pranced anyway, the leash an accessory, not a sentence. Mason\u2019s shoulder pressed for a second and then did not move away. Jack could feel the heat of him through both their coats as a definite fact.\n\n\u201cI need a better verb,\u201d Mason said, and the word was like a sign swung out into the path that said, Now. \u201cI\u2019ve been using admire. I\u2019ve been using care like seventy times a day, the way you say a word so often it turns into a sound that lives under your tongue and stops meaning itself. I could be cheap and say adore, but I\u2019m not that much of a liar. I could say want, but I\u2019m not only talking about hands.\u201d\n\nJack stood very still. He had learned so recently the usefulness of standing very still that it was beginning to feel like one more muscle he could flex when he needed it, and that frightened him because he could feel how that same muscle might calcify if he let it. \u201cYou could say love,\u201d he said, low, almost amused, like a man coaxing a cat out from under a bed with a trail of treats. \u201cYou could say the thing you already said and stop pretending you didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said it like a joke to keep the ceiling up,\u201d Mason said, and when he turned, his mouth was set as if he were about to make an argument before a hostile crowd and he didn\u2019t mind. \u201cI don\u2019t want the ceiling anymore, Jack. I want the weather. I want the roof off and the rain if we have to get the rain. I love you. Not as a disruptor of sentences, not as a strategy that\u2019s gotten out of hand, not as a trick to keep us tethered to the best parts of ourselves. I love you in the way that\u2019s a fact I wake up to like a sore tooth that I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m done with ignoring.\u201d\n\nThere was a length of silence after that sentence that could have been measured in phone vibrations or heartbeats or the distance between one streetlight and the next, which earlier he\u2019d counted without thinking. He hadn\u2019t been counting the space for this. He looked at him. He looked at his friend who had put his whole weight of careful onto Jack\u2019s life for years. He lifted the marble coin in his pocket with his thumb and the edges bit him, a kindness that kept him in his body. He imagined the headline anyway, because both of them would always be people who cared about how the story looked when you set it in bold: Local Man Loses Every Good Thing by Wanting One That Is Not Allowed. He took a breath that tasted like dust and clementine and something close to the first time he\u2019d seen the Capitol out of fog.\n\nHe didn\u2019t say the thing he wanted to say, because the thing he wanted to say would end them and begin them and he couldn\u2019t do both that and make sure the woman with a baby at the bus stop was warm. He set his hands flat on the window sill, a posture like prayer that he refused to name as such out of habit and superstition. \u201cI know,\u201d he said, and his voice broke at the top in a place he didn\u2019t know it had to break to be honest. \u201cI know. I think\u2014I think I have been pretending not to know so it wouldn\u2019t ask anything of me. That is a bad reason and I am sorry for it.\u201d\n\nMason huffed, which in him was the laugh he did when he did not want to be cruel to himself any longer than necessary. He was not looking at Jack now; he was looking at the dog, who had chosen to lie down in the snow and eat some of it with solemn purpose. \u201cNothing in you is a bad reason,\u201d he said. \u201cYour reasons might be inconvenient and shaped like institutions and dressed in scratchy collars, but you don\u2019t get to call them bad because you hate them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate them,\u201d Jack said, and realized he was trying to be fair to his fear. Then, because fairness was a trap and also a virtue he loved like a hymn, he amended, \u201cI hate what they do to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the rest of the headline,\u201d Mason said, as if he had been saving it behind his teeth to bring out if the air survived the first sentence. \u201cI got asked to take a job in D.C. If I want it. A real one with a salary that doesn\u2019t keep breaking its ankle, a team, a title that would mean my mother would stop telling people she raised a night owl with no prospects. They want me to start in six weeks. It would make me the kind of person people call when they want to get places I always told myself I didn\u2019t want. I didn\u2019t say yes yet. Because of you. Because of everything. Because I am so tired of wanting a thing and walking away from it like it belongs to someone else.\u201d\n\nJack had the unkind thought that love and the job offer were a tandem he should have anticipated. He had the kind thought that maybe this was a test in the good sense of tests, a way to see what they were made of, whether the labels they had stuck on themselves would hold if they got wet. He had a hundred petty thoughts and one large generous one, and the trick now was choosing which to let out into the room. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said, and meant it so hard his voice got soft to make room. \u201cOf course they want you. Of course they do. Anyone not trying to get you in their corner is a fool.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you in a room full of fools,\u201d Mason said, and now he did look at him, finally, as if he were letting himself look without guarding the door of that looking. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you where you have to pretend you aren\u2019t a man who would give away the bagels and your shirt and whatever else you shouldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to wake up in a city where the river is efficient instead of itself and not know whether you ate anything green that wasn\u2019t a hope.\u201d\n\nThere are ways to be brave that don\u2019t look like declarations. There are ways to be cowards that look like kindness. Jack tried to put his hands in the right place between those. He reached for the truth that would hurt the least and do the least damage and still be a truth. \u201cIf you want it, you should take it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should take the job. You\u2019ve carried me so far and so well. You should get to carry something else that loves you back without hiding behind a window. I am selfish as a man and as an elected official when I say, also, that I don\u2019t know how to stand in these rooms without the way you tilt your head when I\u2019m about to make a bad sentence.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll learn,\u201d Mason said, and his smile was not the one with both dimples or the fake one he made for the unendurable. It was the small one that showed one tooth and which always made Jack want to leave the room so no one else would see what it did to him. \u201cOr you won\u2019t. And I\u2019ll say no. Or I\u2019ll say yes and we\u2019ll write down every way we can keep this from pulling us apart like a cheap seam. Or I\u2019ll say nothing and let the window do the talking. We have six weeks of winter to pretend we don\u2019t need to decide any of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to decide it now,\u201d Jack said, and hated himself instantly for the relief that washed through him like heat when you come in from the cold. \u201cLunch first. Then ruin something. That was the promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe already ruined it a little,\u201d Mason said, which was true and released something in both of them like a wire springing loose. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Some things don\u2019t work until you take them apart.\u201d\n\nThe light went gold for a second, slutty and generous as if it had forgiven them in advance. The hearing at two o\u2019clock loomed, and then a meeting in a basement where the chairs made everyone tilt forward like supplicants. They turned from the window toward the slow machine of the day again. Jack cleared his throat and found the next small thing to carry. There was a stray boy in the vestibule when they came out of the office, the kind of teenager who looked like all their clothes had cost too much and nothing at all, his hands jammed deep in his hoodie, his mouth stubborn because he was living with someone else\u2019s ruin. \u201cAre you the guy,\u201d the boy said to Jack, not a question anyone had asked in exactly that way before. \u201cThe guy who keeps making my grandmother cry on TV?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope not,\u201d Jack said gently. \u201cDo you mean a good cry or a bad cry?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe says you say things like a preacher but don\u2019t make her want to hit you,\u201d the boy said, and hid his grin behind the collar of his sweatshirt like a man practicing for later. \u201cShe says you are the only one who got the trash guys to come down our street when the cans got froze-shut like they were people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about the cans,\u201d Jack said, because apology was a tool that did work if you didn\u2019t spend it too cheaply. \u201cTell your grandmother I said\u2014I said I will try to say the things I mean when I say them. And tell her if she needs me, I live at Ninth and grace, which comes in two meanings, both of which I\u2019m trying for.\u201d\n\nThe boy nodded, a solemnity older than he should have had flickering across his face like a trick of light. \u201cShe says you smell like oranges,\u201d he said, which made Mason laugh behind him and made the boy pleased, because he had made a grownup laugh without hurting him. Then he left, as if he had been conjured, as if he had only existed to deliver a line that put a pin in their map.\n\nAt two, they went to the basement with the slanted tables where men who had money made a point of sitting in folding chairs anyway to prove they were still of the people. The air was warmer than it ought to be because someone had tried to compensate for the snow by turning the heat to a number that meant sweat would become their civic contribution. Jack spoke and made himself slow enough to find the place where a sentence holds without having to be braced by a hand at its back, and he watched the nods move around the room like a current, hitting the corners where they needed to. He thought of verbs and chose expand without apology. He thought of his hands on the window sill and let them rest at the sides of the podium, as if to say he knew how to let something stand on its own legs.\n\nWhen it was over, he stood in the doorway and took a deep breath because he was alive, and because that had stopped being something he took for granted when he started letting the job draw lines on his ribs. Mason was across the room in the space where people discovered they were the kind of person who could confide in a stranger if the stranger had eyes like his. He looked up and found Jack and made the smallest shrug in the world, which meant something like, We\u2019re not done and also, That went fine and also, I\u2019m walking toward you now because there isn\u2019t any other direction to go.\n\nAt the end of the day there was the river again because the river is what you go to if you live here long enough that you don\u2019t even call it by its name more than once a month. They did not decide to go so much as find themselves there the way you find yourself on a porch you didn\u2019t realize you wanted to sit on. The light was thin, picked over. A boy with a stick was persuading a pile of snow to be a fort and then a spaceship and then a mountain for an ant to climb. In the trees a hawk had done something violent and was busy being beautiful about it. They walked until the bridge sounded like the wind was combing it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to take it,\u201d Jack said into his scarf without making it sound like he was giving an order, which he was not and could not be with him. \u201cI can hear it in your voice when you say the word team. You want it and you think wanting it is an indictment. It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s the part of you I fell in\u2014\u201d He stopped and did not let the word end itself. He reached for his coin, his old dare to himself. He swallowed the rest because he could not change time with a mouth.\n\n\u201cI want to want it without leaving the part where I stand in a hallway and bump your arm and watch a dog lie down in snow like he\u2019s been practicing contentment his whole life,\u201d Mason said. \u201cI want both, which is why I am either a greedy bastard or a man who is finally admitting he\u2019s tired of letting the city make his decisions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could be people who get both things,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe could be. I know how that sounds. I can hear myself. But I also know that when I was ten and the Capitol looked like a magic trick and then I learned how to see the trapdoor and still clap, I thought, maybe the trick is agreeing not to ruin the magic for yourself.\u201d He squinted at the water where it ran quick as sentences through the rock teeth. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make us small because the world is easier to carry when you\u2019re on your knees.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not good on my knees,\u201d Mason said with that crooked grin that hurt and carried medicine. \u201cI\u2019m too tall. I\u2019m good at holding. I\u2019m good at saying the word no for the right reasons and the word yes when it saves someone from drowning. I\u2019m good at your tie. I\u2019m good at the tiny bag of almonds in my pocket when you start to go shake-faint. I am so tired of being good at all of those and bad at telling you I want you enough to put my name on it and deal with the bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod,\u201d Jack said, and the word was not a prayer, but it was not not one. \u201cMe too.\u201d\n\nThe wind found the strip of skin between glove and coat cuff and made it argued with. He flexed his fingers because he didn\u2019t want to lose the sensation that they were his. Downriver, a train crossed, slow as a sermon, and the sound stitched the river to the sky and back to their boots. He wanted to kiss him with a ferocity that had almost no romance in it, only a desire to be done with not knowing. He wanted to put his mouth on his to make any kind of certainty. He thought of the yoga rumor, his mother\u2019s call, the pie that had saved them, the boy in the vestibule. He thought of their names in someone else\u2019s mouth.\n\n\u201cWhat if we don\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d Mason said suddenly, as if he had just been presented with a blackboard and a stub of chalk and a math problem that delighted him. \u201cWhat if we do it like every righteous woman in this city does it. What if we build a room that belongs to us and we lock the door and we don\u2019t apologize for the sound that leaks under it. What if we get to be complicated without letting anyone put their labels on our complication.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a secret I want to keep,\u201d Jack said, and the sentence came out clear and awful. He added, because mercy is a habit, \u201cBut. I understand the room. I understand the lock. I understand that there are some truths you put in your pocket because you can\u2019t walk otherwise. This\u2014\u201d He almost laughed because he had spent days and years refusing to name it as a this. \u201cThis can be a coin I carry. For a while. If you want to see what happens next and he doesn\u2019t end up hating us for doing it wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is the hawk,\u201d Mason said, tilting his head toward the tree where the bird kept being perfect and terrible. \u201cHe is the he with sharp feet and old eyes, and he already knows we are stupid and delicious. He will judge us no matter what we do.\u201d\n\nJack snorted, and the sound broke some concentration the wind had had on being cruel. He reached without permission and put his hand on the sleeve of Mason\u2019s coat. He left it there long enough that it became a fact. He felt the flit of muscles under the wool, small and fierce like birds startled and not flying away. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll write new rules. You\u2019ll take the job, if you want it, and we\u2019ll write new rules. We\u2019ll try to do it without making the kind of mistake we can\u2019t take back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will make mistakes that we can take back,\u201d Mason said, almost cheerful, which was his kind of optimism. \u201cWe\u2019ll make the kind that mean you have to say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I forgot the tissues,\u2019 and I\u2019ll say, \u2018I got you,\u2019 and we\u2019ll fix the draft before it goes to print.\u201d\n\n\u201cPromise me we don\u2019t turn into people who only talk in metaphors about work because it\u2019s easier than saying what we need,\u201d Jack said. \u201cPromise me proof. Even if it\u2019s a stupid proof. Even if it\u2019s just that you let me buy you a new tie like an old man who doesn\u2019t know how to say he wants to touch your neck.\u201d\n\n\u201cI accept the stupid proof,\u201d Mason said. \u201cI will wear the tie to a place where no one else is looking. I will take it off in a way that does not damage the fabric. I will bring a clementine to make sure it doesn\u2019t feel too serious.\u201d He looked out at the water the way a man looks at a thing he has loved longer than he admits. \u201cDo you ever get tired of being the person people think you are supposed to be?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d Jack said. \u201cAnd then someone asks me if I can make the bus stop closer to their house, and I remember I want to be the person who can try.\u201d\n\nThey stood there until the cold did what it always does and insisted. They walked back with their shoulders again doing that near, not touching dance that had a book\u2019s worth of grammar and none of the rules written down. They stopped at the grocery not because either of them needed anything but because the fluorescent lights and absurdist abundance of a suburban-style market inside the city made you feel you were in a place where choices could be made without consequence. They bought milk as if they were the kind of people who regularly drank milk. They bought batteries because winter reminded you of power lines. Mason put two clementines in the basket like a joke to themselves they were suddenly allowed to have.\n\nBack at the office, there was a message from a donor who had been patient and now wasn\u2019t. There was a letter from a little girl with gel pen hearts along the margin asking why people with wheelchairs had to take the long way around. There was an email from Channel 12 asking if he would come on to talk about potholes. He answered the letter first, carefully, because gel pen hearts rearrange a day whether or not they should. He wrote, I am sorry about the steps and the detours and also I am sorry about the ways I have become a person who accepts them because it\u2019s easier in the moment than saying the word ramp out loud in rooms with tight budgets. He wrote, I will try. He did not send it until Mason read it and nodded once like a judge who had decided to deliver mercy for good behavior.\n\nWhen the building cleared, when the last lobbyist had packed up their charts and left their coffee cup to sweat a ring onto a wood surface that had been polished with a paternal fervor by men in coveralls, when the lights hummed and then were kind, Mason shut the door with his hip and leaned the back of his head against the cool of it. He watched Jack with an attention that still, after all these years, made Jack want to straighten his tie and then take it off. He said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to mess this up. And we\u2019re going to be very good at it. Both. At once.\u201d\n\nJack sat back in the chair that always felt a little too big in triumph and a little too small when he was scared. He put the coin on the desk without hiding it. He said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been very good at so many wrong things. This would be a nice change.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome here,\u201d Mason said softly, the words shaped like an order and a plea, both gentle. Jack did, crossing the space in three steps that could have been a mile or a second, he couldn\u2019t tell. Mason didn\u2019t kiss him because if he did they might not stop, and stopping mattered more than giving in for now. He put his forehead against Jack\u2019s forehead and the pressure was the kind you get when someone presses a stone into your palm and says, This is yours for luck. He breathed in, and Jack breathed in, and it was as if they were taking turns being the person who remembered how.\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Mason said, voice steady now that there was meaning lodged behind it. \u201cWe\u2019ll be brilliant and hilarious and full of talking points. We will move the needle, perhaps even the whole sewing machine. And then we can be exactly this again for a minute before we run back into the building we built that keeps trying to catch fire and write its name in smoke.\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Jack agreed, and felt something inside him agree that had been refusing to pick a side. He laughed a little and could not help it. \u201cAlso the serious coat is doing a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour destiny,\u201d Mason said gravely, but his mouth betrayed him and grinned. \u201cYour nose is so red we could hang ornaments on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you ever hang an ornament on my face, I\u2019m calling the ethics commission,\u201d Jack said. He stepped back reluctantly and it was not just reluctant; it was a decision they had made together without a word. \u201cI have to call my mother. She will know anyway if I try to avoid it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell her the yoga instructor is a lie,\u201d Mason said. \u201cTell her the delicious scandal she will hear in the produce section has been replaced by the more nutritious fact of you eating soup like a person who understands winter.\u201d\n\nJack nodded and lifted his phone like a man lifting a heavy baby. He dialed. He said hello and listened to her relief deploy itself in a gentle scold that made him remember the wrong tie at his high school graduation and the right tie at his father\u2019s funeral. He told her about potholes and pie. He did not tell her about the river. He did not tell her about the coin or the room with a lock. He told her, unprompted, that he was eating, which was the closest he could come without the ceiling giving up entirely. When he hung up, the office did that settling thing that old buildings do when you remind them you are leaving them to do what they like best, which is hold.\n\nOn his walk home, the night had decided to be serious after all. The cold had the clean sound of something finished being polite. He stopped at the mural of the woman who laughed and put his palm against the painted sun because it made him feel like he was making good on an old bargain. He turned the corner where the drunk moth of his earlier thought had finally landed and was now resting. He reached his building and climbed the stairs and let his apartment remember him. He stood in the kitchen with its habit of being kind at exactly the wrong moments and took the coin out of his pocket again and placed it on the table like a period.\n\nHis phone buzzed once: a photo from Mason of a clementine peeled into one long coil like a ribbon left on a chair at a party, the caption a single word that was a verb and both a command and a description: Stay. He wrote back nothing because sometimes the answer to a verb is to obey it in your body and not waste language making it pretty. He washed his face. He folded the serious coat over the back of a chair as if it were a person he was asking to stay as well. He slept with the coin in reach, which was childish, and he woke halfway to morning from a dream where the Capitol lifted like a ship out of fog and he had to decide whether to wave or run to the dock. He didn\u2019t pick. He stood there in the dream and did not miss the boat, and when his alarm tapped his shoulder later he understood in the unexpected clean space of dawn that sometimes not missing the boat looks like waiting.\n\nSnow fell again, a stingy lace. He made coffee that tasted less like pennies because he\u2019d cleaned the machine. He opened the refrigerator and discovered there was nothing in it he wanted and then reminded himself that wanting was different now. He sent a text to Mason that said, Bring the almonds, and another that said, I\u2019m wearing the tie you hate, which already meant the opposite. He put the coin in his pocket. He went out into his city, which kept choosing them back even when they disappointed it, which kept offering up its dogs and its boys with grudges and its women in hats and its bridges like outstretched hands. He headed for the building with columns that had learned how to stand through so many loud seasons, and he told himself again the lie he needed not to cry on the bus: Maybe today will be the day the hallway turns into a room with more than one door. He walked into the day. He carried every verb he had. He did not forget the noun.Chapter 5\n\nThe hearing room on the third floor liked to pretend it was a courtroom, which it wasn\u2019t and never would be, but it had the flags and the pew-hard chairs and the corner where acoustics went to die. Jack took his place at the table with a legal pad he didn\u2019t intend to write on and a cup of coffee he would forget to drink. The city\u2019s winter light came through the blinds as if unsure it had the right to be there. He had slept with the coin under his pillow and the sleep had been full of trains, which made sense only if you didn\u2019t try to make sense of it. When Mason came in he looked like the same person who had leaned his forehead against Jack\u2019s last night and also like a stranger who had borrowed that person\u2019s coat. He slid into the chair beside him with the whisper of wool and paper and gave him a look that said, We are going to pull this off because the alternative is letting the day run errands for us and we don\u2019t allow that.\n\nThe first speaker was a man who had come to bless and scold in equal measures. He wore a tie that had once been festive and was now just tired. He called Jack by his full name and then shortened it without permission, as if intimacy could speed the passage of his grievance through the pipeline. Jack listened the way he had taught himself to listen, which was with his head slightly cocked and his mouth in a position that communicated both humility and willingness to say the word no. He thought, as the man read from a paper he had folded into a geometry the night before, about the word they had chosen together. Expand. It sat between his teeth like a seed. It would need watering. It would need sun. He would have to keep people from stepping on it just to feel the satisfaction of crushing something that wasn\u2019t theirs.\n\nBetween speakers he leaned in and said, very low, \u201cYou didn\u2019t text me when you got home.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t trust my sentences,\u201d Mason said without looking at him, his pen poised above the yellow pad like he was sketching a map no one else could see. \u201cI thought I might build a bridge to a place we weren\u2019t ready to stand. I sent you citrus instead. It seemed less dangerous and more honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI put the peel on my windowsill,\u201d Jack said, and then a woman approached with a folder, and he folded the confession into his pocket and smiled with the part of his face that could smile without betraying the rest.\n\nAfter the hearing, a reporter ambushed them in the hallway that smelled like a cross between soap and old anger. She had red ears from the cold and a voice she used when she wanted to sound like your aunt and your interrogator. \u201cDelegate Crowder,\u201d she said, holding her mic like it was a truce flag she might snap in half. \u201cThere\u2019s buzz that donor pressure is shaping your transit bill. Have you changed the language in response to contributions?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll language is a response to something,\u201d Jack said, buying himself two seconds with a truism he could almost defend. He felt Mason to his left and slightly behind, a position that meant I am watching the angles and also I will pull you out by your collar if you walk where there\u2019s no floor. \u201cWe\u2019ve updated the bill because riders showed us where we could do better. If someone wrote a check and also rides the bus, I\u2019m happy that those two good habits can coexist.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if someone wrote a check and doesn\u2019t ride the bus?\u201d she said, her eyebrow lifting like the arm of a crane.\n\n\u201cThen I hope they\u2019ll consider trying one,\u201d Jack said, and he used the bright version of the smile because sometimes humor disarmed people who wanted to sharpen you into a cautionary tale. Mason stepped in so gently no one could call it interference and said, \u201cWe\u2019re expanding access. That\u2019s the headline. Expanding. You can call us at four if you want specifics on cost recovery. We love to make numbers sing.\u201d\n\nBy the time they got back upstairs the office smelled not like clementines but like the plastic clamshell of pie Mason had set on the file cabinet the day before. He had tucked a fork under the lip of the lid as if he knew future versions of them would need it. On Jack\u2019s chair there was an envelope with the donor letterhead he recognized. It had the weight of expectation and a font that assumed it would be obeyed. He put it in the drawer without opening it and felt almost brave. He would open it later and consider the bargain it tried to write for him and then, if he was lucky, he would write another sentence on top of it that did not scream but also did not kneel.\n\n\u201cWyatt wants you for three minutes alive at five,\u201d Mason said, perched on the edge of the desk with the ease of a man who had only recently learned how to take up the space his body required. \u201cIf you go, he won\u2019t ask about the yoga instructor. If you don\u2019t go, he will, and he\u2019ll bring a mat.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we have to pay for the mat?\u201d Jack said, and it felt good to let the joke come like muscle memory. \u201cI have a serious coat and a serious tie. I can do serious at five.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can do serious at any hour,\u201d Mason said, but his eyes did a small, private thing, like a shutter opening and closing. \u201cMs. Pettigrew\u2019s grandson got glued. Not literally. They got him to the nurse, she glued the chin, no stitches. There\u2019s a rumor he showed his scar off to his math class and got someone\u2019s phone number out of it. The righteous sometimes prosper.\u201d\n\n\u201cSend them flowers,\u201d Jack said, and then thought about high school boys and felt the complication bloom in his chest. \u201cNo, not flowers. That\u2019ll embarrass him. Send her a card. And\u2014I don\u2019t know. Soup?\u201d\n\n\u201cSoup is safe and declarative,\u201d Mason said, writing it down. \u201cSoup says we see you and we will not make you do dishes.\u201d\n\nThe afternoon was a parade of useful tedium. The zoning subcommittee turned its chair into a throne for an hour and then climbed down and apologized for the height. A woman with a planner full of neon flags wanted to know if they could make dogs legal on the bus on Sundays because that was the day their owner\u2019s depression was worst and walking in the cold felt like a punishment. Jack said he would ask, and he would ask, and maybe he would make a rule that dogs on Sundays were allowed if they were carried, which would be both adorable and likely to cause an allergic incident that would land on Channel 12 with a thud. He learned the route of yet another elevator that claimed to be out of service but would grudgingly carry you if you held the door and spoke kindly to it. He ate half a granola bar and discovered it was the kind meant to imitate dessert badly.\n\nAt three, his mother texted him a picture of a floral arrangement at her church with the caption, Ugly as sin, which made him milk-laugh and promise God in his head he would not hold the blasphemy against her. He sent back a photograph Mason had taken that morning of the dog in the snow with the caption, Joyful sinner and let the exchange be instead of a phone call. He thought briefly, painfully, about what it would mean to say the word boyfriend out loud to his mother in a kitchen with laminate like old teeth. He imagined her face, how it would go through its stages like thunderheads, and then he put the thought down because it wasn\u2019t fair to make her do the work in his head and then fault her imagined performance.\n\nAt four-thirty, the donor called. It wasn\u2019t someone with a checkbook; it was the assistant with a schedule and a script. She had the voice of a girl who had placed fifth in debate and never recovered from the shock. \u201cDelegate Crowder,\u201d she said, \u201cMr. Halloran wanted to follow up on his letter regarding the TIF expansion. He\u2019s concerned about the rhetorical direction of your office.\u201d\n\nJack put the call on speaker because it made it less intimate to be told he was disappointing someone with money. He watched Mason as the voice went on about job creators and the business climate and the way a phrase like expand could sound like promise to the wrong ears. Mason did what he did best. He did not blink much. He did not roll his eyes. He wrote in the corner of the yellow pad, writes checks but not bus poetry, which made Jack have to cough to disguise the laugh.\n\n\u201cMr. Halloran\u2019s concern is duly noted,\u201d Jack said, when the assistant paused, either to breathe or to reload. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to working with the business community to produce predictable outcomes. We\u2019re also committed to making sure that a mother with two jobs doesn\u2019t have to take three buses to get to a shift that pays less than your intern\u2019s rent.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d love to help you find a middle ground,\u201d she said, as if the ground had to be strained through her approval to be middle enough. \u201cCould you send us your draft language by the end of the day?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can send you a summary,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe\u2019ll release the text when we release the text. I think that\u2019s fair.\u201d\n\n\u201cFairness can be subjective,\u201d she said, probably because she had been told it was a good line that made legislators sweat. \u201cWe want to remain supportive.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe too,\u201d Jack said, and he let his voice get warm like a sun that doesn\u2019t owe anyone anything.\n\nWhen he hung up, Mason blew out his cheeks in a performance of annoyance that didn\u2019t even begin to cover his affection for the ridiculousness of people who thought access meant ownership. \u201cIf Mr. Halloran would like to ride the crosstown at six a.m., I will buy him a pastry so he doesn\u2019t die on his way to empathy,\u201d he said. \u201cI will personally pick him up from his freshly paved driveway and hold his mitten while he waits.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will lose all your points with heaven,\u201d Jack said, and he no longer had to tuck the affection back behind his teeth. \u201cHeaven hates sarcasm.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeaven runs press,\u201d Mason said. \u201cHeaven knows a good line when it hears one.\u201d\n\nAt ten to five, they walked over to the station through air that smelled like whatever came before snow in a city like this. The sidewalks were busy with people who were pretending they didn\u2019t have to watch their steps. Wyatt\u2019s producer corralled them with a smile sharp as a safety pin. Wyatt himself was wearing a tie that had not been ironed in this decade and the visible relief of a man who had wrestled his rundown into submission. He had the good kind of hunger, the kind that made him lean in without trying to bite. \u201cWe\u2019ll toss you a softball and then something with two seams,\u201d he said, recoiling slightly from Mason\u2019s scarf like a cat from a cucumber and then recovering with professional grace. \u201cAvoid yoga. Embrace potholes. We\u2019re all going to be heroes.\u201d\n\nIn the two minutes before they went live, Mason stood off-camera and ran his thumb along the seam of his coat the way he did when he wanted to smoke and wouldn\u2019t. He mouthed expand like an absurdist religious devotion, and Jack looked at the monitor because if he looked at Mason he would forget the number he had memorized. He answered the questions and didn\u2019t let his hands talk too much because the cameraman had once told him they unsettled viewers. He said the phrase predictable outcomes again and managed not to smirk. He remembered to thank the anchor by her name, which made her eyes soften for a split second, not for him but for the place where his name and hers lived briefly in the same air.\n\nAfter, in the hallway that was always three degrees colder than any other hallway in the city, Mason said, \u201cYou threaded it. You threaded a needle while someone was trying to shake your elbow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to say fuck,\u201d Jack said, and the swearing felt like a small rebellion that would never make the news.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll put it on a mug,\u201d Mason said, and then, more quietly, \u201cSix weeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cSix weeks,\u201d Jack repeated. He had thought the words would make him feel the drop he had learned to anticipate in elevators that didn\u2019t warn you they were going to stop between floors. Instead he felt the brief steadiness you get when you\u2019ve decided to keep walking even if the sidewalk turns out to be ice. \u201cWhen do you go to look?\u201d\n\n\u201cTuesday,\u201d Mason said. \u201cTwo days of meetings and the ritual of pretending we don\u2019t know what each other\u2019s jobs are. I\u2019ll be back in time for the school board if the train remembers itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t wear that green tie,\u201d Jack said, and he heard the way the sentence was both trivial and not. \u201cWear the one with the small squares. It makes people think you\u2019re not bored even when you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the worst bagel shop owner but you\u2019re excellent at ties,\u201d Mason said, and the grin he gave him was the one that had always done something to Jack\u2019s equilibrium that science should study. \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay without me for forty-eight hours. You will not be allowed to rearrange your desk to punish me while I\u2019m gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be busy not swearing on television,\u201d Jack said, and he felt, absurdly, like he wanted to take Mason\u2019s hand, not to kiss it or clutch it, just to demonstrate to the air the simple physics of it. He put his hands in his pockets instead and touched the coin with his thumb until it was a compass again.\n\nThey did not go to the river that night, which felt like an omission and also like restraint. They went instead to a neighborhood meeting in a room that had once been a kindergarten and still smelled faintly of paste and two-year-old sweats. A woman in a denim jacket stood up and talked about her mother\u2019s porch, how the developers had promised it wouldn\u2019t be shadowed by anything new and now you could put a hand on the siding at noon and feel you were pressing your palm against dusk. A man snorted when someone said equity, and then apologized, and then said equity again without the snort, which is its own kind of miracle. Mason passed Jack a note that said, Not allowed to fix everyone and then drew a jellyfish wearing a top hat. Jack felt laughter move through him and settle into a braid with his ache.\n\nOn the way out, under the weak shout of the streetlight, a kid with a skateboard pretending to be a sled nearly ran into Jack\u2019s knees and then apologized by swearing with a sincerity Jack envied. \u201cWatch your mouth,\u201d an aunt in a pink beret said without heat, and the boy did not. Mason wrapped his scarf higher and said, \u201cWe need to write a rule about us and community meetings.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the rule?\u201d Jack said, and it made him shy to say the word us even though it should have been the easiest word he had.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t sit next to each other,\u201d Mason said. \u201cWe don\u2019t look at each other when someone says synergy. We don\u2019t let our faces finish sentences we have decided not to speak.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll fail,\u201d Jack said, but he nodded, because some kinds of failure you plan for and then execute with grace, like falling on ice without shattering your coffee. \u201cWe\u2019ll fail and then we\u2019ll make a joke and call it training.\u201d\n\n\u201cTraining is for the river,\u201d Mason said, and then, shrugging into the coat, \u201cI lied. Training is for us.\u201d\n\nSunday came, though it had the indecisive weather of a weekday in disguise. Jack went to his mother\u2019s house because some obligations were love in work clothes. She opened the door with a dishtowel in her hand and a look on her face that said she had been waiting on the landing for fifteen minutes, listening for his step like a girl. The house smelled like onions and the salt of somebody else\u2019s happiness. On the counter, she had set out a plate of cookies that were the wrong shape and therefore perfect. She asked about potholes with more interest than anyone on television. She touched his cheek with two fingers and then pretended she hadn\u2019t.\n\nAt the table, she told a story about a woman from choir whose nephew had been invited to D.C. to work for someone who believed in good shoes and bad health insurance. She watched him watch her and he watched himself watching her and it was like the three of them were looking into a mirror that kept changing who it reflected. \u201cD.C. is for people who like to hear themselves buzz,\u201d she said, and then softened it, because she was always kinder than her first sentence. \u201cD.C. is for people who like trains.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome trains are good,\u201d Jack said carefully, and he took a cookie and didn\u2019t break it in half. \u201cSome trains take you exactly where you meant to go but you didn\u2019t know it until you got off.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always were a boy who took too long to go to bed,\u201d she said, which was not the sentence he\u2019d expected and therefore the right one. \u201cI can hear you at night in my head, walking circles. That\u2019s not a criticism. It\u2019s a fact I wake up with like a sore tooth.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t borrow my metaphors,\u201d he said, and his voice went thin and he let it. \u201cThey don\u2019t sit right on you.\u201d\n\nShe made a face, which on her meant affection disguised as disapproval. \u201cBring your friend around for supper,\u201d she said, as if that were a thing they did all the time and not a small astonishment. \u201cThe one with the scarf. He looks cold half the time. I\u2019ll make something that makes him stop looking that way.\u201d\n\nHe would have sworn the air in the kitchen tilted. He would have sworn the light did something generous without warning. He swallowed and discovered his mouth had gone dry with gratitude. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be away for a couple of days,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter, maybe. When the trains are done with him.\u201d\n\nShe nodded as if trains were a reasonable adversary and then pinched his ear like he was ten and said, \u201cWear a hat,\u201d which was her way of saying I know and I\u2019m trying.\n\nWhen Mason left on Tuesday, he left the office looking like itself on purpose. He set the pie fork in the drawer. He angled the stapler a degree to the left because he knew Jack would notice and pretend he hadn\u2019t. He put a clementine in the pocket of the serious coat like a benediction he didn\u2019t have the vanity to speak. At the station, he texted a photograph of the departures board and wrote, God is a schedule and then another of his own shoes with the caption, These are the ones that don\u2019t make me look like a man who makes speeches and Jack wanted more than anything to be sitting beside him, knees touching briefly at the turn of a curve. He wrote back, Don\u2019t fall in love with a policy analyst in a gray suit, and Mason wrote, Too late.\n\nThe office felt loud in the wrong ways without him. The copier took it as a personal challenge to jam when no one else was around to listen to its song of grief. People came in and said their sentences and left and he found himself looking at the doorway as if the building might spit up the person he wanted like a blessing. He wrote an op-ed about sidewalks with the tone of a man who knows people think sidewalks aren\u2019t exciting and is determined to seduce them anyway. He took two meetings alone and didn\u2019t say a joke where Mason would have said one and afterwards got an email from a man who had been present that said simply You were kind and true and is there a word for that in Greek, which made him put his head down for thirty seconds to let the compliment do what it needed to do without cracking him open.\n\nAt lunch he took his sandwich to the stairs because stairs have always been a good place for people who want to be dramatic without asking for witnesses. He ate slowly and did not text Mason because he didn\u2019t want to knit the day tight around the absence and call that comfort. He counted the number of blue coats going by and then made himself stop because counting could become a superstition if you let it. He thought of the room with the lock and of the hawk and of his mother\u2019s cookies, which had made a silt of sugar on the plate that looked like someone\u2019s home planet flecked with stars.\n\nAt three, the assistant from Mr. Halloran\u2019s office called again, which was a surprise he recognized as an omen. \u201cWe\u2019d love to offer you an amendment you can call your own,\u201d she said, like a woman opening a jewelry box to show you a trinket she would lend you for a night and then take back at the door. \u201cIt\u2019ll keep the developers from wandering off.\u201d\n\n\u201cDevelopers aren\u2019t toddlers,\u201d Jack said, and he made sure the tone had no spike in it. \u201cIf they need a nap, we\u2019ll talk to them about their schedules. We\u2019re not going to gut the funding mechanism so you can call it bipartisanship and I can call it nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mayor will be disappointed,\u201d she said cheerfully, which is another thing people say when they mean, Someone else will try to make you pay.\n\n\u201cThe mayor gets disappointed sometimes,\u201d Jack said, and he looked out the window at the dog running without a leash again, delighted by his mission to be exactly himself. \u201cHe gets over it.\u201d\n\nWhen Mason called from D.C. that night, the connection made them sound like they had cotton in their mouths. The city the phone built between them was a clumsy one but serviceable. \u201cEverything here is extra,\u201d Mason said, and Jack could hear traffic like a misplaced symphony. \u201cThe compliments wear sequins. The insults wear cologne. A man walked past me talking about bipartisan stakeholder synergy with tears in his eyes. It was almost moving. I almost believed him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your headline you hate?\u201d Jack said, and he stood at his window and watched a couple fight kindly on the sidewalk about their groceries. \u201cGive me the worst version so I can write the better one while you\u2019re asleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate the one that says I left you to be important,\u201d Mason said, quiet in the way he got when he was nearest to saying what he meant. \u201cI hate the one that says I traded the river for an efficient canal and called it love. I hate the one that says I didn\u2019t try to choose both, and I hate the one that says I did and everyone laughed at us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will be laughed at for worse,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe will be laughed at for the tie you hate and the serious coat and the word equity when we put it in a sentence without apology. We can live with that, if we have to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI found a bakery that made me think of your niece\u2019s whales,\u201d Mason said, because sometimes he could not allow himself the direct sentence. \u201cNot because of whales. Because of the tiny ridiculous frosting that only exists to make someone stop being mean to themselves for an hour. I bought a cookie. I did not eat it. I carried it around like a scandal and then I stopped on a bench and I ate it and no one arrested me for joy and I thought, I can do this for six weeks. I can learn the names of the subway stops and pretend they are ours.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring me a cookie if it travels,\u201d Jack said. \u201cBring me a rumor about yourself that is not about yoga.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlready in circulation,\u201d Mason said. \u201cSomeone said I was seen smiling sincerely at a lobbyist. Don\u2019t tell anyone. It will ruin me.\u201d\n\nHe slept badly without the knowledge of Mason\u2019s breath on a sofa across a room, which made him ashamed because he had always prided himself on being a person who slept like the dead and did not ask others for the favor of unbroken rest. In the morning, he woke with the conviction that this was manageable if he kept his day small enough to carry in one hand. He drank coffee that had not improved in his absence. He wrote three sentences for a speech about alley lights that sounded like hymns in his ear and then laughed at himself because he knew better than to be that man in public.\n\nHe was not prepared for the boy\u2019s grandmother in the lobby mid-morning, wrapped in green wool and righteous posture, scar-chin boy trailing behind her with the wounded pride of a person whose injury had made him briefly holy and then just a regular kid again. \u201cI brought you a pie,\u201d she said, and she set it down on the desk with the soft thud of a present that came with a condition. \u201cI brought you a pie because you called the man who knows the manager who knows the driver who knows the nurse. You didn\u2019t tell them who you were until they asked, and even then you said it like a person and not a program. I wanted to do a thing in a pan that would make that true longer.\u201d\n\nJack tried to say thank you in the way that matched. He failed, but he failed in the direction of sincerity. The boy rolled his eyes at him with affection like a gift he wasn\u2019t sure how to accept yet. \u201cHe says you smell like oranges,\u201d the boy said, as if this were a criticism, which it probably was and that was fine. \u201cHe says you say things like a preacher and then you say sorry when you should and not when you shouldn\u2019t. You want us to help you get you on the news? We know a guy with a drone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re okay for drones,\u201d Jack said, and he took the pie and didn\u2019t pretend he wasn\u2019t honored. \u201cBut if you want to tell your friends that we\u2019re going to try to make the bus not treat you like a secret, I wouldn\u2019t argue with that.\u201d\n\nAfter they left, he put the pie beside the old pie and marveled, briefly, at the abundance in this tiny economy of sweetness. He wrote to Mason, Two pies, which he knew would be read as more than two pies and Mason wrote back, Keep one in the lock room, which made him laugh aloud in the empty office and then look around as if the walls could be offended.\n\nThat afternoon, he stood under the mural of the aunt with the rolled hair and answered a call from the mayor, who was in a mood that could have been called \u201cpractical terrorism.\u201d The mayor wanted the word \u201cpredictable\u201d more times in the bill than there were buses in the city. He wanted \u201cexpedite\u201d and \u201csunset\u201d and \u201curban fabric\u201d like a magic trick that could make gentrification a rug they swept regret under. Jack said a set of sentences that felt like walking through a room with a low ceiling and avoided hitting his head on the light fixture only because he had been in that room before. When he hung up, he put his hand on the painted sun and it felt warm not because paint can do that, but because touch makes its own heat.\n\nBy the time Mason came back, the river had frozen briefly in the corners that didn\u2019t matter. He walked in with his scarf in the self-satisfied loop of a man who had charmed a train into being on time. He looked like the same person and like someone who had been looked at by strangers for two days and had to remake his face. He put his bag down on the chair visitors pretended was comfortable and he didn\u2019t say anything for four seconds because the silence between them had to remember how to be a bridge and not a moat.\n\n\u201cI brought you a cookie,\u201d he said, and he held up a small white box with a string like a storybook. \u201cIt has traveled. It has suffered. It is still itself.\u201d\n\nJack took it and the string came undone as if the box had been waiting to be relieved. The cookie inside was absurdly delicate for a thing made to be destroyed. It was piped with a border of sugar that thought it was lace. He broke it in half and handed the larger piece to Mason without theatrics and they ate, leaning against the desk like two boys in a kitchen who had never learned to stand up straight when the world had something good for them. The sweetness went chemical and then clean and then brief, as all sweetness does when you don\u2019t chase it with something rude.\n\n\u201cTell me the worst thing,\u201d Jack said once the sugar had settled, because he could not resist asking for the bruise.\n\n\u201cThe worst thing is how much I liked being important to strangers,\u201d Mason said, looking down at his own shoes like they might tell him a kinder story. \u201cThe worst thing is I thought, I can do this and I can do us, and then I walked past a man sleeping under a stone lion and I thought, I can\u2019t be in two cities and pretend that\u2019s not a decision and also pretend I\u2019m delicate about the right things. The worst thing,\u201d he added, and his mouth was the shape of a man who might bite himself to stop a sentence, \u201cis that for two hours today I didn\u2019t think about you at all and I thought, This is what the job would be like, and I was relieved and then I hated myself and then I forgave myself because I am learning not to be cruel to me when I am honestly trying.\u201d\n\nJack felt the coin bite his thumb. He set it on the desk because he was tired of hiding the way he stayed. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t punish ourselves for being good at more than one thing. We don\u2019t pretend we\u2019re saints when we\u2019re men with calendars. We write a rule that says we get to want the job and the river, and when we fail the rule we try again. We can try again until we\u2019re dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re terrible at bagels but excellent at rules,\u201d Mason said, and the grin came like the light across the river when the clouds move just enough to make you believe you could walk the water without sinking. \u201cI put a deposit on a place for six months. Not there. Here. My lease is up. I\u2019m going to keep a bed that\u2019s mine and a room that\u2019s ours. If I take it, I go, and then I come back. If I don\u2019t, I sleep there and you can find the key in the place I\u2019ll show you once and never text.\u201d\n\nJack felt his eyes get hot, which he hated. He nodded because nodding was safer than speaking. He breathed and thought about the hallway and the room with more than one door. He thought about the word stay and how sometimes the bravest thing it asked of you was to mean it. He reached forward, not across a desk, not in the river\u2019s permission, but here, in the ordinary light of their ordinary office, and he put his hand over Mason\u2019s hand and did not move it away. They stood like that, the day waiting politely for them to notice it again, the pie aging gracefully on the cabinet, the coin a small faithful circle between them. Outside the window, the dog lay down in the snow and ate it with the same solemnity as before, unwavering in his belief that nourishment could come from cold.\n\nThey were interrupted, of course, because that was how their lives were arranged\u2014grace with a doorbell. The intern stuck his head in without knocking and said, \u201cChannel 12 is here with a camera to ask you about sidewalks,\u201d and then winced because he had surprised himself with his own bluntness. Jack removed his hand and they both took a breath that sounded ridiculous on the quiet. Mason straightened his tie like something you do when you aren\u2019t sure what else to fix.\n\n\u201cSidewalks,\u201d Mason said, turning toward the door and rolling his shoulders back into the shape of the man who could make sentences carry their own weight. \u201cLet\u2019s go tell the city we want them to stop tripping on their own feet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll say expand ninety times,\u201d Jack said, and the joke steadied him like a palm on his back, firm and unembarrassed. \u201cWe\u2019ll say fair without letting it bite us.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd after,\u201d Mason said, his voice back to that bright rim that meant he was comfortable in the difficulty, \u201cwe\u2019ll go buy a tie I will hate so thoroughly I will love it.\u201d He lifted the clementine from the coat pocket where he had stowed it for luck and set it on the desk by the coin as if the two of them were a matched set. \u201cProof,\u201d he said, and the word did its work in the air, a hinge between their separate motions and the place they were building to come back to.Chapter 7\n\nBy the time the daffodils appeared in trapped triangles along the medians like cheerful warning signs, the city had decided, briefly, to forgive winter for its indecision. The river loosened its shoulders where it had stiffened around rocks, the ice shrugging itself into harmless, bright shards. Jack woke before his alarm because light, at last, wanted to be counted on, and he lay there with the coin under his pillow, aware of its small, insistent circle the way you\u2019re aware of a promise you haven\u2019t yet paid. He dressed without the serious coat and let the whales at the ends of his scarf grin at the elevator door as it opened and shut, a tiny rebellion against the halls that preferred their men in unblemished tones. In the car he turned the radio low and didn\u2019t hear the headline because his brain was busy rehearsing the sentence he would say if someone tried to modify expand into a weaker flirtation. He passed a man jogging in a sweatshirt that declared his allegiance to a team that hadn\u2019t existed in three decades and thought, with a tenderness that surprised him, about all the ways people chose to belong.\n\nUpstairs, the office had that morning plainness he had learned to love because it meant nothing had been set on fire in his absence. Mason was there before him, which meant the train had remembered its duty and returned him with the particular smugness of public transit that behaves. He was humming under his breath, not a song exactly, but the sound he made when he was lining up the day\u2019s obstacles and assigning them numbers. He looked good in the way that made Jack want to sit down and pretend he had always been in the chair; travel had put a faint windburn into his cheeks, and his hair had discovered a part it didn\u2019t usually admit to. He said, as if they were mid-conversation, \u201cI missed the man with the dog. I kept expecting to see him on the sidewalk up there, going rogue around a marble fountain. He didn\u2019t show,\u201d and then he smiled because he understood he was saying, I missed you, and they were the kind of people who gave the truth a face it could bear.\n\nThey divided the morning the way you divide a piece of cake you want the other person to steal bites of. Mason set up the pre-brief for the noon presser about streetlight repair, and he did it with the care of a person who understands that saying the word luminaire incorrectly can make a room decide you don\u2019t deserve electricity. Jack called the route manager from Operations and made him explain, again and without sighing, how a change in snow protocol had stranded a bus on a hill it had no business trying to conquer. Ms. Pettigrew called to tell them the boy\u2019s scar had turned into bragging rights he was using judiciously. She delivered the update like a woman reading from the minutes of a meeting you hadn\u2019t been invited to and then concluded, \u201cI brought a slice of pie to the driver and I said, \u2018Don\u2019t do it again,\u2019 and he promised and also asked me for the recipe. That seems fair,\u201d to which Jack replied that fairness, when attached to pie, was the only version that never disappointed him.\n\nNear ten, Warren from downstairs brought up an envelope again that had the weight of either a threat or an apology. He put it on the desk with the gentleness of a man setting down an egg he wasn\u2019t sure was hard-boiled. The letterhead was the same as before; the assistant had typed their concern into a new shape as if rearranging the furniture could make a smaller apartment bigger. Jack left it unopened, letting the paper do the small work of appearing ominous while he spent himself elsewhere, and he said, to no one but the air, \u201cLater,\u201d which in his mouth meant both never and as soon as I can afford it.\n\nThey had promised themselves a rule about community meetings, and like most rules they\u2019d ever written, its value increased when they broke it. At eleven, a neighborhood association with a fondness for capital letters brought a delegation into the office to explain how a proposed bike lane would steal their peace and their parking and possibly their firstborns. Mason stood slightly to the side and let Jack do the patience, and then he entered with a story about a woman he\u2019d known who\u2019d walked four blocks with her groceries in heat that made your skin into fabric. He never said the word equity. He didn\u2019t have to. When they left, one of the men shook Jack\u2019s hand for too long and whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re not like the others,\u201d which was a kindness and an accusation, both of which were useless and lovely in equal measure.\n\nJack\u2019s mother called at eight after sending a test text that said simply Hat? as if to remind him that there were promises she kept track of that weren\u2019t connected to a committee schedule. He answered and heard the apology in her breath for the tone she\u2019d used last week that had come out sharper than she\u2019d planned. She asked, in a voice that wanted to be casual and couldn\u2019t be, whether his friend\u2014no name, as if to say she wasn\u2019t sure if names were safe\u2014would come Sunday for supper. He told her yes, and she said, \u201cI have a roast that needs an audience,\u201d which was as close as she could come to happy about a thing she knew she might not understand. He hung up and relayed the invitation to Mason by sliding a sticky note across the desk with the word audience written on it in a hand he\u2019d made deliberately slanted, and Mason nodded with the sober joy of a man who had been given permission to belong at a table.\n\nSunday came with the smell of onions like a hymn you didn\u2019t grow up with but learned to hum. Jack\u2019s mother wore her sweater that made her look like a lighthouse keeper on leave, and she had set the table with the good plates that had flowers someone else would have called old-fashioned. She said, \u201cYou\u2019re skinny,\u201d to Jack, which is what she always said, and then she turned to Mason and said, \u201cYou need a hat,\u201d which made Mason grin and lift the hem of his scarf as if to say he was trying, and she pretended to be unmoved by the charm that would have worked on her even if she had insisted for a decade that it did not. They ate with the careful ferocity of people who know the difference between hunger and appetite, and they told the stories they could tell, the ones whose edges were dull enough not to cut. Jack listened to his mother talk about choir as if it were a legislature with a better alto section, and he watched Mason ask questions like he was folding himself into a family and not simply making conversation. After, Mason did dishes without being asked, his sleeves rolled, the river of his forearm working in quiet ways, and Jack\u2019s mother stood with a towel and said nothing for a while and then said, \u201cI like the way you pay attention to pots,\u201d which was the way she knew to say, I see you looking out for the things that are good for my son.\n\nWhen she went upstairs to search for the recipe she had promised and would not find because recipes in her house were more folklore than math, Mason leaned his hip against the counter and said, in a voice that had less air in it than usual, \u201cI think she likes me in the way that matters, and also she scares me just enough to make me behave.\u201d Jack laughed and wanted to put his hands on the square of counter between them and his chest, to anchor the surprise of feeling soft in his mother\u2019s kitchen without the fear that softness would cost him something irretrievable. He brushed his knuckles against Mason\u2019s wrist, a motion that might as well have been a confession, and Mason did not move away. The contact made him briefly brave enough to imagine telling the truth on this tile, in this light, and then his mother\u2019s footsteps sounded on the stairs and he put the thought back in his pocket with the coin and told himself, later, which was a lie he could live with for another hour.\n\nThe hour gave itself up as hours always do, and Monday did its familiar magic of pretending it was a stranger. The morning paper folded itself around a photograph of Jack in the serious coat from two weeks earlier with a headline that tried to be kind to his bill while insulting his haircut, which is how you could tell the editor had managed the compromise of affection and skepticism. Channel 12 called to ask whether he had a comment about a rumor that had stopped being about yoga and started being about money, which was a relief in a way; it is always easier to be accused of the venial sins of funding than the mortal ones of longing. He said, \u201cI have many comments about money. I have none about gossip,\u201d and the anchor laughed, delighted to be given something she could use between a weather map and a story about a squirrel that had gotten into a drafty attic and refused to leave.\n\nHe would have liked the day to stay in those manageable lanes, but instead it decided it wished to be a highway. Before lunch, an email arrived from a news outlet up the road that had discovered FOIA not as an instrument of transparency but as a toy. The subject line was customer-service cheery: FOIA Request: Selected Texts Regarding Transit Policy, and Mason whistled when he saw the sender because he knew the games people played when they wanted to put you on the defensive without saying so. They\u2019d asked for texts from Jack to anyone within a list that included two journalists, a scheduler, and \u201cany consultant or informal advisor.\u201d It was both precise and vague in the way that punished you for refusing to have a staff of fifty. Jack felt his fingers go cold on the keyboard as he read the dates. He thought instantly, absurdly, of the clementine ribbon photograph, and then he told himself to breathe because the photograph did not contain a crime unless you counted the possibility that joy could be evidence.\n\nMason sat on the edge of the desk and made the face he made when he was deciding whether to bring the cousins to the family reunion. \u201cWe have options, and some of them are almost not terrible,\u201d he said, and he listed them the way he would list parts of a speech. \u201cWe can fight scope and look defensive, or we can comply clean and look boring. We can say we used personal devices for personal things and will cull the work texts, which is true, and then everyone will print the single interesting thing and ignore the two hundred logistics about chairs and microphones. We can write our own version first and make sure the headline has our verb in it and not theirs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is their verb?\u201d Jack asked, because he had learned that asking that question made some battles less likely to be lost purely out of stubbornness.\n\n\u201cExpose,\u201d Mason said, and rolled his shoulders as if the word had put a burr under his shirt. \u201cWhat is ours?\u201d\n\n\u201cExplain,\u201d Jack said, and he thought of the boy in the lobby and his grandmother\u2019s pie and the way language shifts when the person using it allows you to sit down.\n\nThey pulled the texts, which felt a little like undressing in the doctor\u2019s office\u2014humiliating only if you imagined an audience you didn\u2019t actually believe deserved a seat. There were long stretches filled with what they had always understood was their true work: Where are you, Fifth and Main, Bring the binder, This microphone hates me, Ms. Pettigrew says the driver sang to the little kids, Call Warren, Channel 12 wants numbers not adjectives, I left you coffee by the window. The clementine coil photo was there, and the caption with its single disobedient verb. There were three separate texts where one of them had typed the word fairness and then corrected it to something else, as if the word itself were a superstition they wouldn\u2019t say aloud in a house that creaked. There was nothing that made their private life into a scandal because they had not let themselves have one, but there was enough to make a certain reader feel they\u2019d been allowed to peek behind a curtain that had always been symbolic more than sturdy.\n\nThe reporter called, as they knew he would, and asked the question as if he was embarrassed for both of them. \u201cIs your staffer your partner?\u201d he said, and the pity in the tone made Jack\u2019s back go up as effectively as an insult would have. He replied with the voice he saved for nurses and for women who came to ask him to hold what they were ashamed to admit they\u2019d been carrying alone. He said, \u201cMy staffer is one of the reasons I can do my job. He buys me almonds and refuses to let me embarrass myself in public. Our texts will show you that I can forget to eat lunch and that he believes in clementines. They will also show we talk about bus stops more than is healthy, and that we used the word expand in a way that will improve the life of a woman with a stroller.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are saying,\u201d the reporter said, and the phrase unrolled like a rug you had to choose whether to admire or trip on. \u201cPeople are saying you\u2019ve misled your constituents about who is whispering in your ear.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are saying a lot,\u201d Jack said, and he kept his voice from going brittle by thinking about the whale scarf and the hawk in the tree. \u201cI\u2019m telling you that the whispering is almost always about verbs and chairs, and sometimes about pie.\u201d\n\nWhen he hung up, he realized his hands were shaking, which was an indignity he hadn\u2019t suffered with any regularity since the day he\u2019d sat in a basement hallway and discovered his father\u2019s tie was a knot he could untie by himself. Mason stood close and then closer, not touching, but making the kind of heat that made touching almost unnecessary. He said, in a register that noticed the tremor without making it the whole story, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be thanked for any version of this. We can at least decide who we\u2019d rather be blamed by. I vote we choose the people who bring us pie.\u201d\n\nThe news did what the news does and grazed them on its way to the next bright thing. The story ran online with a photograph of a bus that did not belong to their city and a headline that managed to put Jack\u2019s name next to the word ally as if they had invented each other. The comments learned nothing. The donors decided to wait, though Mr. Halloran\u2019s assistant sent a friendly note that translated to, The way you bury the lede could use work, which made Mason laugh hard enough to have to put a hand on the file cabinet. The mayor called and did the thing where he pretended he had never said the word predictable. Ms. Pettigrew texted, simply, Pie forever, and the boy added an emoji that Mason had to explain to Jack with a straight face.\n\nThe floor vote on transit came scheduled like bad weather. Jack counted heads as carefully as a mother counts children in a crosswalk and found, every time, that one of them had wandered off to look at a squirrel. He had five speeches he could give depending on the direction of the wind and one he wanted to give that made no mention of cost recovery and many mentions of people who do their jobs while being insulted by strangers. Mason, in the gallery, wore the tie Jack had told him made him look like he had a plan, and he sat so still he might have been an architectural feature. They rehearsed their verbs by eye contact until it was time for the vote, and then they stopped speaking even that language because the quiet you owe a vote is like the quiet you owe a prayer.\n\nIt went as good and as dumb as these things go. A man who had told Jack in the elevator that he believed in the bill as a gift to the city rose and said a string of sentences that made the thing sound like a boogeyman stealing silverware. A freshman with his hair still in the shape of the rush he\u2019d ridden in on told a story about a bus driver who had saved his grandmother from a thunderstorm when he was nine, and the metaphor got lost in the thunder, but the room clapped anyway because sometimes clapping is the only correct answer. When it was his turn, Jack did the sentence he had been practicing in his mouth all morning, and it sat in the air the way a sturdy bench sits where you can find it when you need to sit down. He said the number and didn\u2019t swagger. He said the word expand only twice because too much of a good word can turn it greedy. He said, toward the end when he could feel some of the heads turn toward him instead of toward the clock, \u201cWe can do better,\u201d and the anchor\u2019s face who had shaved his hair into politeness the night before softened in the second row, which shouldn\u2019t have mattered and did.\n\nThe board lit the way boards do, like a bell that doesn\u2019t want to ring, and names turned green and red with a rhythm that was almost vulgar because of how easily it reduced the air to yes and no. He realized he had been holding his breath when he heard himself exhale and thought, absurdly, of the coin and of Mason\u2019s breath across a sofa months ago when the lamps had made them both look like they had been discovered in an attic and brought back into use. The bill passed by the margin he had predicted in the way that makes a man want to stop predicting and let himself be surprised. There was clapping, not polite but not ecstatic; there were handshakes from men who wanted to be in the photograph without having to vote to be in the photograph; there was a note that slid into his palm from a woman who had voted no and was brave enough to put a heart next to her apology.\n\nHe found Mason in the corridor, because of course he did; the building arranged itself so they could always perform the trick of bumping into each other as if it were fate and not choreography. They didn\u2019t speak at first because the air in the hall belonged to everyone and they had decided, recently and without a formal declaration, that they would not take things that weren\u2019t theirs. Mason touched his sleeve lightly, as if to confirm the fabric had not been changed by victory. He said, not in a whisper because whispering admits guilt too easily, \u201cYou were precise. You didn\u2019t give away any bagels,\u201d and Jack grinned and allowed himself the smallest cruelty of thinking of Mr. Halloran\u2019s face. He wanted foolishly to put his hand against Mason\u2019s tie and smooth it, not because it needed smoothing but because his fingers needed proof, and instead he gestured vaguely toward the river and then remembered they had agreed not to deploy that as a code every time the world made them too large for rooms.\n\n\u201cTonight,\u201d Mason said, reading the gesture anyway and translating it to something that wouldn\u2019t be mistaken by the wrong ears. \u201cWe can go and watch the water pretend to be going somewhere else. Or we can eat in a place where no one knows us and pretend food can fix everything,\u201d and Jack said they could do both because he had decided they were now people who got both when there were honest ways to take it.\n\nThey chose a diner with a cracked checkerboard floor and a waitress who had been calling men honey since Reagan and had perfected the art so it never sounded like insult. They slid into a booth where the vinyl protested with a sound like someone older than them getting up. Mason ordered pancakes because he refused to believe you needed permission to have them after noon, and Jack ordered an omelet and decided, loudly enough for the waitress to snort, to leave the broccoli in. They did not speak about the bill until after the plates had been set down because sometimes victory is a fragile creature you must let settle before you ask it to perform. They talked instead about the man counting change at the counter who had a smile that made every tooth look like a confession, and about the woman in the corner teaching her mother to use a phone with that stern humor daughters learn when they have had to ask their mothers to be young and their mothers have refused.\n\nWhen they did talk about the bill, they didn\u2019t talk about it in terms of triumph. Mason said, \u201cHere is the list of the first ten people who will be outraged when the bus changes route for five minutes to pick up a woman with a stroller,\u201d and Jack said, \u201cHere is the draft of the apology letter that is not an apology,\u201d and they laughed because that was the only correct answer when faced with the fact that doing a thing cracks a different thing. The waitress refilled their coffee and said, \u201cYou two boys look tired like you\u2019re proud of it,\u201d and Jack felt something physical in his chest loosen because someone had called them boys as a tenderness and not a diminution. He wanted to hold the word and examine it for impurities, and then he let it go because hoarding kindness ruins it.\n\nOutside, the sky had the scraped-clean look it gets after weather has tried and failed to keep your attention. They didn\u2019t need to say river; they found their feet pointing that way because habit is its own language. The bridge hummed like a machine that meant well. On the rocks, the light had changed to that late-day pewter that made even the graffiti look deliberate. The possum with the crown had been painted over by a hand that didn\u2019t know reverence when it saw it, and someone had written in chalk beneath the new, less charming cartoon: YOU CAN\u2019T ERASE JOY, which was a claim and a dare. They sat and the cold ran up through their shoes in a way that wasn\u2019t unkind. Everything in him wanted to decide fast and be done with wanting. He let himself be slow because speed had never made him braver, only louder.\n\n\u201cSix weeks,\u201d Mason said, almost smiling at the number\u2019s neatness as if a clean integer could discipline the chaos. \u201cIt turns out time is both a schedule and a weapon. I have learned the names of three people I am supposed to call when I want something to be two floors away in five minutes. I have also learned the name of the woman who runs the coffee stand and knows when I am lying to her about sugar. I stood outside a building made of glass that announces itself without humility and thought, I could be good here and hate it, or I could be lonely and call it merit. And then I got on a train that thought itself very important and came home because there is a dog here that refuses a leash and a boy with a scar and your mother\u2019s roast and a bill written with the right verb.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you do with the letter?\u201d Jack asked him, because that was his way of asking laboriously, What are you going to do with me, and he could not bear to pose it naked.\n\n\u201cI wrote the subject line,\u201d Mason said, and it made Jack laugh when he didn\u2019t expect to. \u201cI wrote, In which I attempt to choose both, and then I didn\u2019t write the body because I wanted to see whether the river could make the rest of the sentences honest. They will be about the way I am greedy for rooms where I can be someone who says sentences like these without the ceiling deciding to fall. They will be about how I intend to keep a key in a place you can find by feel.\u201d\n\nThey were careful for a long minute not to look at each other because looking makes things either grow or die, and neither of them had the courage to watch for that. A train slid across the far bridge as if it were the border of a slow-motion film, and he could feel the vibration in the rock beneath him the way you feel a lover pass your chair at midnight in a kitchen full of laughter. He thought of the word kiss and did not make it into a sentence. He thought of the word stay and did not believe it would bring the ceiling down if he spoke it to a man who had already read it into a picture of fruit.\n\n\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, which was the same sentence as before and not at all the same, because now he meant a different kind of closeness. He didn\u2019t stand. He didn\u2019t perform. He put his hand on the back of Mason\u2019s neck because that part of the body is a hinge, and he pressed his mouth to Mason\u2019s mouth with the care of a man who had rehearsed this gesture unconsciously for so long he was a professional at restraint. It wasn\u2019t cinematic; there was neither music nor perfection. It was a learning. It was a press and a breath and the discovery of a heat he had carried alone so long he had forgotten it could belong to two people without violating a statute. When they separated, which they did before the world had a chance to catch them at it, they sat back slightly and let their faces be blank for the birds and the teenagers practicing adulthood on the far bank. The only hint anything had changed at all was the way Jack\u2019s breath came like a man who had been underwater and had not drowned.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make mistakes,\u201d Mason said, and his voice had the stability of someone who had finally decided to stop arguing with gravity. \u201cI am going to choose the wrong hour to call and the wrong joke at a meeting and the wrong shirt to meet your mother. I am going to forget which elevator is the one that behaves and I am going to be asked by a man I don\u2019t respect to give up things I do. I am going to hate D.C. in a sincere way and then I am going to hate the way it stops making me feel special, and both will be ugly on me. I am also going to carry almonds and learn the word luminaire without rolling my eyes and I am going to remember where you keep the coin even when you move it to punish me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am going to say sorry for things that don\u2019t deserve it and not say it when it matters,\u201d Jack said, feeling his mouth warm with the list as if he had been waiting years to audition for a part. \u201cI am going to allow men to talk themselves into circles because it loosens their collars, and then I am going to resent the clock for not being the companion I want. I am going to refuse to be small in rooms where people would like me to be smaller, and then I am going to be tempted to make myself into a shadow so I can keep my good things. I am going to fail at privacy in public and privacy in private. I am going to forget to eat and remember to bring soup. I am going to bring you a tie that is wrong and you will love me and the tie anyway.\u201d\n\nThey sat until cold did its particular preaching. They stood carefully because you can fall out of happiness if you move too fast. They walked back not touching and touching, a choreography they could perform without rehearsal, and when they reached the path where the chalked message about joy insisted on itself, they stepped around it because they had no interest in becoming the kind of men who put their feet on declarations for the irony of it. Back at the office, the pie on the file cabinet had settled into itself and had probably begun to give up on them. Mason cut two slices like a man performing a ritual he did not want an audience for and worshiped anyway. He placed the coin beside the plate like a sacrament. They ate with forks they didn\u2019t deserve and they laughed when sugar did its bright sting.\n\nThat night, because the city had a calendar, they went to a vigil in a park for a man nobody important had learned and everybody in his block had loved. Candles sputtered in paper cups like fight surrenders into heat, and a woman with a voice that did not need amplification sang a line that made the hair on Jack\u2019s forearms stand at attention. He saw men in suits pretending they had stumbled upon the event and quietly calculating where to stand for maximum empathy per square inch. He saw the boy from the lobby holding his scarf like a mouth and not crying because he had told himself he wasn\u2019t a kid anymore and then deciding to cry anyway because being a person is better than performing a version of one. He felt Mason\u2019s shoulder a rumor against his. When the song ended, a woman stood and said, \u201cWe do not ask for permission to grieve,\u201d and since grief and joy are sometimes the same discipline in different outfits, Jack thought, We do not ask for permission to love either, and he held that line like a rail as the night shifted toward cold and broke without warning into kind.\n\nAt home, he put the coin into the bowl where he kept keys and imagined it adding its small weight to the other things he needed to leave and return. He called his mother and told her nothing and everything in the careful way they had perfected: that he ate, that he slept, that his day had done the thing days do and insisted, that the roast had been exactly right, that her kitchen had been the safest place in the city for an hour even though the smoke alarm had asserted itself with unnecessary drama. She told him, unprompted, \u201cTell your friend that he can borrow a hat,\u201d which made him laugh into the receiver and say he would, and then she said, \u201cYou sound less alone,\u201d in a tone that wanted to be brisk and failed, and he said, \u201cI am,\u201d and that was enough for a night.\n\nMorning put on its business clothes and demanded their receipt. The mayor sent a statement that did its best to take credit for everything and blame for nothing, which is his species\u2019 native tongue. Mr. Halloran\u2019s assistant wrote, Emotions aside, can we talk TIF language, which made Mason write a reply that said, Emotions are how people live in a city, also yes, which was the compromise he\u2019d trained himself to be good at. Ms. Pettigrew sent a photograph of the boy with his butterflied chin at an angle that made him look far too ready for a life in which he would have to insist, and a caption that read, Baby thinks he invented hardship, bless his heart, and Jack loved her with a fierceness that had nothing to do with legislative obligations. The dog ran leashless again and looked back only once, and it was at them. Warren told them he was thinking of retiring and then smiled to make them panic and then said, Not yet, which was his favorite joke because it proved he could still feel indispensable.\n\nOn Wednesday, the city decided it had not had a proper argument in weeks and supplied one. The streetlight contractor failed to deliver three poles and a promise, and a reporter with a flair for theater balanced herself on an unlit corner and demanded to know if Jack had ever walked in the dark himself. He considered saying, Every day, and then decided to talk instead about bulbs and timelines and the way darkness covers everyone in a way that is both democratic and cruel. He said, \u201cWe will not allow infrastructure to be a metaphor,\u201d and Mason pinched the bridge of his nose, because sentences that pretty were both medicine and opiate in his view, and they had made a rule about those too.\n\nThe letter to D.C. got written in the quiet after a meeting where three expensive men had advised them to stop talking about buses like people. Mason closed the office door with his foot and leaned on the glass as if trying to impress upon the building itself the importance of being exhausted at the right time. He wrote with his hand in a way that hurt and then, at the end because there are rituals and he honored some of them, he typed it for form. He gave it the subject line he\u2019d promised and then he sent it and then he stood there with his palms on the desk like a man who had pushed a car up a hill and was waiting for the engine to decide whether it would catch. He said, without looking up, \u201cI chose both,\u201d and Jack said, \u201cGood,\u201d and he meant, I know what that costs and I will pay some of it with you even when that is inconvenient and ungenerous in equal measure.\n\nThey told no one who would make it smaller by knowing. They told the pie. They told the coin. They told the river, which did its old work and didn\u2019t need their sentences to keep going. They told the dog by bumping his shoulder on the way past and letting him forgive them because forgiveness is a skill dogs practice for the joy of it. They left their office light on a few minutes past the hour because the building liked that and they were sentimental men and trained themselves to pretend they weren\u2019t.\n\nThe next weekend, his mother called and said, \u201cI bought a hat,\u201d and the word made a perfect circle in his ear like the coin he did not carry to her kitchen. She added, because she knew who she was in this story and did not wish to shirk it, \u201cI bought two. One is uglier. He gets the other.\u201d He laughed and said he would tell him, and when he relayed it, Mason put his forehead against the door frame the way he had done that night when all they had to declare was proximity. He said, \u201cYour mother and I will collude against you,\u201d and Jack said, \u201cI know,\u201d and stood there with his hands in his pockets like a boy who has decided he can take more than one kind of risk and still keep his shoes tied.\n\nThe city continued in its stubborn, beloved way. A new mural went up of three women with their arms around each other looking like they\u2019d been told to smile and had chosen, instead, to smirk because that would last longer. A man in a suit fell on the ice in front of a church and stood and bowed to no one, as if to insist that dignity could be made out of a good fall. Ms. Pettigrew\u2019s boy learned to make a pie crust that did not crumble and then pretended he had invented pastry. The boy at the meeting who had asked about drones sent him a direct message that said, I got into art school, which made Jack sit with his phone in his hand for a long minute and then type, I am proud of a person I have only technically met, and then erase it and send a heart, which was both less and more.\n\nOn a Tuesday that had not announced itself as important, a bus driver pulled over because the boy with the scar had stood and recited to him the schedule changes with such authority that the driver had laughed and invited him to sit up front and use the microphone if he thought he could do better. The boy did, and Ms. Pettigrew filmed it, and the clip made a small, honest noise on the internet, a noise that was neither outrage nor cynicism, only a cheer in a register people had forgotten was permitted. Channel 12 called and offered to do a spot that was not about potholes, and Jack said yes because sometimes you say yes just to prove your mouth remembers how.\n\nThat night, at the edge of the river where night puts its elbows on the rail and listens, they stood without touching and touched without moving, which had become, accidentally, their new talent. Mason said, \u201cTell me the worst thing,\u201d and Jack said, \u201cThe worst thing is that I will want to hide you when I should want to show you,\u201d and then he asked it back and Mason said, \u201cThe worst thing is I will want to show you when I should want to hide you,\u201d and they both laughed because this, at least, could be a game they played to remind themselves there were limits and there were none. He took the coin from his pocket and set it on the rail and then put his hand over it as if he were daring the wind, and he felt Mason\u2019s palm over his, the warm architecture of fingers and a wrist he had learned like a street. For a second he let himself believe they were the only two people awake. Then the train crossed and the city breathed and the night applauded them for simply staying, and he allowed himself to think, briefly and without punishment, that maybe, after all, the second chapter had decided to be easier.Chapter 9\n\nBudget season arrived the way humidity does\u2014first as a rumor in the air and then as a fact you could taste whether or not you wanted to. The white dog went missing for a week, which made everyone in the building superstitious without admitting it, and then reappeared wearing a bandanna like a pirate who had been rescued and returned a little prouder. The river, indifferent to appropriations, shouldered along the same rock spines, and Jack smoothed the bills and the numbers and the grins that turned into demands as if he were ironing the sheets of a small hotel where you wanted the guests to think the beds made themselves. Mason came and went on trains that began to feel like a third person in the room, and in the way of good trains they were sometimes early and sometimes a weapon and often an alibi no one had requested and everyone used.\n\nOn a Tuesday that had pretended to be a Thursday all morning, the mayor invited seven of them to a breakfast in a hotel ballroom that had spent real money on chandeliers and none on the coffee. The pancakes came in a stack that looked like a photograph of a stack, and a councilman whose default setting was contrite gave a toast that ended with the phrase \u201cpublic-private partnership\u201d like a promise he thought he could make and keep with the same sentence. Jack ate a bite of egg too big to be elegant because hunger doesn\u2019t wait for applause, and he felt rather than saw the movement at the far door where the donors did theater about arriving late. Mr. Halloran\u2019s assistant gave him a smile that admitted she had read all the same memos he had and liked some of them more than he did, and then she angled through the crowd like someone who had practiced moving through water in a dress that had opinions.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate your willingness to be reasonable,\u201d she said, which was the warmest version of what she meant, and he admired her for choosing the nice word even when the instrument she wanted was a wrench. He told her, politely, that reasonableness was in his pocket next to the coin and that he would bring it out in public when the city could be trusted not to spend it on the wrong thing. Mason watched him from the edge of the dais that wanted to be a stage and texted him a drawing of a man juggling four lamps and a bus, and underneath it he wrote, Smile with your eyes and not your mouth, which sounded like a joke and was a technique, and Jack followed it as if the second row were a mirror he could trust.\n\nThe photograph of them at the river had been taken by no one and also by everyone, because the world by now and for years had taught itself how to see without asking permission. It wasn\u2019t a kiss, because they were not careless or brave in that particular way yet, and it wasn\u2019t nothing, because you could see the way their shoulders had decided to be honest even when their mouths were not. Someone sent it to Channel 12 and to a blog that was less interested in transit than it was in the transit of feelings across men\u2019s faces, and then the photographs did what photographs do and showed up in places that had no business being interested in them and therefore were. The anchor with the neat hair called to warn him because courtesy had not yet gone wholly out of style, and she added with a tone that tried to balance a weighing pan, \u201cThey\u2019ll say it says something. You can decide what.\u201d\n\nHe walked to the window because the window had never lied to him. In the lawn a school group tried to listen with the patience of their teacher\u2019s faith, and one boy had peeled off from the line to put his whole face to the ground to see a bug, which felt like the moral he never had time to make himself learn. Mason read the article with the kind of attention he usually reserved for punctuation in a contract, and when he finished he looked at Jack the way he\u2019d looked at the serious coat the first time, as if to say, You can wear this, but you do not have to let it choose you. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t accuse,\u201d he said mildly, tapping the screen with a finger he had disciplined. \u201cIt insinuates. It winks. It will force you to respond to a tone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am better at numbers than tone,\u201d Jack said, and he wasn\u2019t wrong about that even if a good day made him wish he could afford to be. \u201cWe could say nothing and let it spend itself. We could say too much and teach it to reproduce.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could write our own headline again,\u201d Mason said, and he made the small smile that had never stopped being a risk in a room, even now. \u201cWe can say this: A man who rides the bus and carries almonds loves a man who says expand instead of enhance, and together they intend to lower your wait time and raise your expectations. That\u2019s either the end of something or the beginning of a new chapter in which the city minds its business in the way that means it gets done.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be the story,\u201d Jack said, and the honesty of it made him sound like someone he would have mocked on the floor five years ago. \u201cI want the bus to be the story. I want Ms. Pettigrew\u2019s boy and his glued chin to be the story. I want the dog to be the story every day before my tie.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are the story when they decide you are the story,\u201d Mason said gently, and he didn\u2019t put his hand on Jack\u2019s wrist even though he wanted to. \u201cWe can make the story tell itself better. Or we can stand here and force it to write its own shabby copy.\u201d\n\nThey had talked for months in rooms with and without locks about telling. They had made a list on a napkin once of the words they would not accept in any article about them and then laughed like men who know lists are exactly the kind of control that goes slack at the first bend in the road. They had practiced sentences, not because they planned to perform all of them but because rehearsal is its own kind of courage and kept the panic from turning into improvisation. At the end of every practice, they had rummaged around for proof, for the little objects that made the day feel attached to their bodies and not to the current running through the building. Sometimes the proof was a clementine, which was happy and difficult to argue with. Sometimes the proof was a list of names of women who had given up lunch to get to a hearing. Sometimes the proof was the coin, a brazen admission that he held luck where he could and that he refused to let the marble apologize for being beautiful.\n\nThey wrote a statement at the little table in the office where they wrote everything important, because small tables make honesty feel heavier than the room can get away with. They did the sentences in pieces and then stood them up and walked around them the way you walk around a chair someone has built for you, checking for wobble you can sand out before you ask people to sit. They started with the bill because it was true that this day had been meant to be about sidewalks and timing and the way light can protect you and the way it can fail you and how both of those are the council\u2019s fault if they are asleep, and they moved to verbs because verbs had become a bridge for them more than once. The paragraph about what you call two men who lean toward each other and refuse to be ashamed took all the time it was going to take, and they let it because speed is not a virtue on certain kinds of roads.\n\n\u201cWe could say it is none of your business and also I love him,\u201d Jack said, and he heard how it could sound like arrogance and also like a man with a kitchen table and no intention of inviting anyone to judge the soup. \u201cWe could skip the love and say we\u2019re colleagues and friends and keep pretending the rest, which would be the old honesty that did not deserve its name.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeak the first sentence,\u201d Mason said, and his voice had gone into the register where it got quiet because he was being brave and needed oxygen. \u201cWe owe them only the first sentence. The rest we owe ourselves.\u201d\n\nWhen the statement ran, it sat there like a chair in the middle of a room where some people had been pretending they were not tired. People either ignored it because their list of things to ignore was longer than their list of things to attend to, or they read it twice and then sent it to their sister, or they said the word finally like a souvenir from another city they had visited once and thought about moving to. Some of them said rude things because rudeness is free and requires nothing but an underused thumb and an imagination that runs only on insult. Some of them said beautiful things that did not belong to them because they had never had to be brave like this and wanted to borrow. Ms. Pettigrew called and said, \u201cBaby, I do not care who you kiss if you keep that bus from being late,\u201d which was the best and truest sentence his phone would ever carry and he wanted to put it in his wallet and present it like a card when someone at a podium tried to make him into a moral they had written in advance. His mother said, \u201cI already bought him a hat,\u201d and then she said, after the deliberate pause that proved she had considered all the ways she might be unkind and rejected them, \u201cBring him for supper.\u201d\n\nThe outrage that had been promised by those who needed it to feel important lasted through lunch and became the kind of complaining that makes a room seem busier than it is. Jack went down to the plaza with a sandwich he did not intend to eat and found the dog sprawled in the thin sun like an old man remembering being fast. A child in a frog-green jacket asked if the dog belonged to him, and he said, \u201cI think he belongs to the weather,\u201d and the child nodded because children have a better sense for ownership than anyone and knew that some things can be shared by everyone and held by no one. Two teenagers sat on the edge of the planter making a video that involved both of them falling on purpose and one of them laughing more than the other, and a woman with an umbrella used it like an extension of her arm to point to the part of the railing she wanted fixed because her mother used it to lower herself and that should have been in the budget last time and was not.\n\nThe first person who said something cruel said it as a test, which is always a kindness compared to saying it as a sport. He stood too close and smiled too big and used the word traditional the way you use a door that should have been oiled. He said that Jack had lost his mind to a coastal agenda even though the nearest coast was perennially shocked to discover how often the river ate its own edges. Jack let him finish because you owe people the dignity of finishing when they want to be rude to your face. Then he said, \u201cWe\u2019re talking about your streetlight, sir. We\u2019re talking about timing and dollars and the fact that we can do better by the walker you haven\u2019t noticed because you use a garage,\u201d and the man got flustered because decency was not the reply he had rehearsed for his own applause. He backed away and muttered something that had furniture words in it and then he fell silent because the dog had decided the man might have a treat and had laid his head on the man\u2019s knee in a way that was a plea and an absolution. The man reached down and scratched the dog\u2019s ears and then left without telling Jack his name, which was the best ending to that story they could have asked for.\n\nMason\u2019s train that night was late and late again. He texted apologies as if the train were a toddler who needed you to point to the clock to understand responsibility, and Jack wanted to send him an old paper schedule of buses to remind him that lateness is a language they had both learned as children and had been trying to translate into kindness. He walked down to the river alone because the air felt like the throat of a song and he didn\u2019t want to stand in his kitchen pretending to be patient. The rocks were a study in how unromantic the truth looks in daylight and how it becomes a chapel when it wants to. He sat with his knees apart the way you sit when you refuse to fold yourself for the comfort of a bench, and he watched two boys in jackets that had cost both too much and not enough light one cigarette and then correct themselves and put it out because their own lungs gave them the sermon their mothers had tried to. The red of the butt against the patches of old snow made him think of his niece\u2019s whales and the way small absurdities keep people honest.\n\nHe heard the footsteps he wanted before he saw the person he wanted, which should have felt like a metaphor and was only the relief of someone you loved not being a ghost. Mason sat without the drama of a sigh because he had always been careful about not giving the river reasons to think him theatrical. They didn\u2019t speak for long enough that the cold could make their bones aware of themselves. Then Mason said, \u201cMy mother called to tell me the news as if I didn\u2019t know, and then she told me about a woman at church who is sure she invented kindness in 1972 and wants to license it,\u201d and Jack laughed because Mason could make a complicated love for his mother sound like an accurate weather report. He told him about the dog being owned by the weather, and Mason nodded and said, \u201cThat checks,\u201d and put his hand on the rock near Jack\u2019s hand but not over it because the night still felt like it would forgive them only in increments.\n\n\u201cI thought it would be worse,\u201d Jack said, and he meant the day, and he meant that he had been braced since adolescence for a disaster that would carry the angle of a headline. \u201cI thought the building would turn its back. It only tilted. People said beautiful things with too many exclamation points and rude things with too many capital letters, and then they went back to worrying about the bus.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey went back to worrying about themselves,\u201d Mason said, and there was no judgment in it. \u201cIt\u2019s the only honest way to live in a city. I kept waiting for a man in a suit to pat me on the head and say he forgave me for existing, and instead a woman at the coffee stand called me darling and gave me the wrong change and I gave it back, and we both behaved like we\u2019d done something radical.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d Jack said, and he wanted to lean his head on Mason\u2019s shoulder the way a boy puts his head on a desk late in the day when the numbers turn to soup. \u201cWe did. I feel lighter in a way I do not trust yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll learn to carry it,\u201d Mason said, and he said the words like he was opening a cupboard to show Jack where the bowls lived. \u201cNot because we are noble. Because we have to lift other things and we can\u2019t do that with one arm.\u201d\n\nTheir privacy didn\u2019t shatter so much as rearrange. People who hadn\u2019t felt permitted to ask now felt permitted to ask and then discovered their questions were poor and deserved to be replaced with better ones. People who had known all along because the world teaches you how to recognize people who are breathing for each other said nothing and started bringing them information you can only get when you\u2019re trusted not to waste it. Mothers brought hats. Boys brought jokes. The white dog brought his own face to press against their knee and expected nothing but a message sent through skin: you belong. In the building, eyes had always watched them for other reasons, and now they watched them for this as if this were the most interesting part of the work, which it wasn\u2019t and was. They set rules for themselves and then they broke them two at a time, and then they wrote new ones because the point was not to be perfect but to be decent and the only way to be decent is to admit failure while attempting repair.\n\nWhat broke was not the ceiling or the floor; it was a small restraint Jack had learned at fourteen and refined at twenty-five, the one that kept his hand from reaching across the desk when no one would think to look. He was distracted in new ways that felt like old ones. He stood by the window and watched the boy with the scar touch his chin and pretend he had survived a war when he had only survived adolescence, which might be harder, and he let himself be happy in front of Warren, who clucked his tongue and hid a grin in the paperwork he had been threatening to retire behind for a decade. He wrote sentences for a hearing about alley lights that had nearly too much light in them, and he took one out because he could hear Mason\u2019s throat clearing in the margin and wanted to beat him to it.\n\nThe next wave broke as small and mean as gossip always is, curled around a convenience store on the edge of a district that had been promised more than it got. The photo of the river drew out a man who ran a weekly that was running out of weeks and liked to resuscitate himself with oxygen stolen from other people\u2019s lungs. He wrote about \u201cthe whisper network\u201d and \u201cthe corridor grapevine\u201d and pretended he was quoting someone when he put the word compromised in a sentence with Jack\u2019s name, as if love were a contaminant and not the only reason anyone stayed long enough to write a better paragraph. In the comments a woman wrote, \u201cI do not care who he loves, I care where the bus is,\u201d and a man wrote, \u201cI do not care where the bus is, I care about sin,\u201d and a third person wrote, \u201cThe bus is on Broad if you\u2019d like to go see it,\u201d and then the thread degenerated, and that was a mercy because degenerating threads do less harm than tidy arguments.\n\nMason wanted to punch a wall in the way of men who have learned not to and instead walked around the block and pretended to be on the phone with a cousin. He came back with red in his cheeks and a plan that involved writing entirely too much down and then throwing half of it away. He said, \u201cWe could sue, and then we would be men who sued and lost time we could be spending on alley lights, so we won\u2019t. We could ignore it and let it calcify into something that keeps us from breathing, so we won\u2019t. We are going to do the boring thing that works. We are going to say, again, that love is not a line item, and that all the lines we care about are on a schedule.\u201d\n\nThey walked to a barber shop everyone agreed was neutral ground because its owner had learned the art of letting people lie to themselves while he cut their hair into honesty. The televisions played old Warriors footage and a rerun of a game show that had never been as kind as the host pretended, and the clippings fell like tough confetti. When the barber finished with a man who had come in angry and left with his eyebrows in a new arrangement named \u201cMaybe,\u201d he looked at Jack and said, \u201cI got your picture in my window,\u201d and Jack braced himself and then saw the photograph with the caption HANDSOME MEN, BAD HAIRCUTS, VOTE ANYWAY, and he laughed with the kind of relief that makes your knees untrustworthy.\n\nIt was almost a relief when the actual scandal arrived with a budget line you could circle and a name you could pronounce. The contractor with the streetlight poles had bid low enough to get the job and high enough to pay for three beach houses, and he had done it with the help of a nephew who had not technically joined the firm and had technically joined every person in the building\u2019s holiday party photographs. A reporter with freckles and a merciless affection for documents brought a printout to Jack the way a woman used to bring a pie to a man who had helped her with a fence, and she said, \u201cYou want to yell at me about timing,\u201d and he said, \u201cNo, I want to tell you thank you and also to bring a sweater because the hearing room thinks it is a church that punishes knees.\u201d\n\nThey called the committee to a special session and Mason did the thing where he stood still enough to be mistaken for an architectural feature and then moved just enough to make a row of men adjust their ties. Jack did the careful anger that works better than thunder, and he put the words transparent and predictable in the same sentence and almost didn\u2019t flinch at the double-edged nature of both. They asked for invoices and got shrugs, and asked for contracts and got this\u2019ll-take-a-minute, and he watched two men discover on television that they had not known how to hide a favor with any competence and breathed, uncharitably, like a man who is relieved he got to call someone else to the carpet. The mayor\u2019s office sent over a man with a voice like the sound of a credit card being declined and asked to be allowed to pretend they had been surprised by the sunrise, and Jack gave him that dignity because he knew he would need the mayor for a vote on alley lights in two days and because meanness glues itself to you long after the applause is over.\n\nThe boy with the scar came to sit in the back row and made a show of not listening, which is to say he listened like a man getting ready to tell the story later in a way that would make him the hero and also honest. Ms. Pettigrew wore a hat that had acquired a small bird that must have been sent over by a niece with an eye for mischief, and when a delegate who had never ridden the bus attempted to make a joke about how nice it was to have company in the public seats, she fixed him with a look that had seen through enough men to fill an index and said, \u201cWe are the public here,\u201d which ended the attempt with the kind of grace that doesn\u2019t need applause to be fulfilling. The white dog, as if to support the idea that not everything was about them, chose that moment to gallop past the open door in pursuit of a pigeon that did not care to be pursued, and everyone watched it because animals are the appropriate intermission for human nonsense.\n\nMason\u2019s letter from D.C. came back with a tone that had practiced sounding reasonable. They wanted him for more hours and fewer complications, which translated to \u201cWe are going to pretend this is a meritocracy while we count your steps,\u201d and he read it with the same face he used for line edits on a draft that had good bones but had been decorated with adjectives like cheap jewelry. \u201cI can do this,\u201d he said, and then, because rehearsal is honesty, he added, \u201cI can hate this and still do it, but I am not going to pretend my hate is nobler than my want.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou once told me that you are happiest when you are interesting to yourself,\u201d Jack said, and he didn\u2019t know that the sentence would land in Mason\u2019s chest and rearrange furniture. \u201cIf they take that from you, leave. If they let you keep it, stay, and write the stupid reports we will both use to make a thing we cannot make here without permission. Then come home, and we will commit the wild sin of trying to have more than one city.\u201d\n\nHe did not lose the coin because he kept it where he was: in his pocket during hearings, on the desk like a talisman in the afternoons, under the pillow on nights when the building made noises that sounded like bad news getting dressed. He found a second coin without meaning to, a token from a carousel they had found half-lit at a church fair in a neighborhood that wanted more light than it had. He put the carousel coin next to the marble one one night and thought, a little giddy with the metaphor pressing too hard, that he was collecting circles in the hope that their perfect shapes would teach his life how to make good turns. He did not tell Mason about the second coin because he was learning the difference between secrecy and the slow pleasure of saving an anecdote for later. He brought it out once when they were at his mother\u2019s and the world had arranged itself precisely enough that small presents and soft jokes were appropriate and did not have to be explained.\n\nHis mother, who had trained herself to call Mason by his name and then, without fanfare, to add \u201cbaby\u201d when she forgot, watched the two of them move plates like men who had done this since they were boys and said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen worse pairs try to carry a sofa,\u201d which was as much as she was prepared to indulge poetic metaphor in her kitchen. She did not pry beyond the kind of questions that let her own heart stop rehearsing catastrophe\u2014Are you eating, are you sleeping, when are you both coming next, and have you seen the neighbor\u2019s begonias\u2014and she did not look at them for longer than she needed to make the space around the table big enough for what they had decided to allow. When Mason broke a glass and cursed the way you curse when you\u2019re annoyed more than sorry, she laughed and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll pay with a pie,\u201d which was not a penalty in any world they believed in.\n\nThe week of the budget vote, the photographer who had taken the river picture sent a note in a hand that went sidewise politely asking for credit. She wrote that she hadn\u2019t meant to make trouble and had wanted only to save something. She said that she had cried in her car after she saw the article because she had known what she was doing when she took the photo and had not known what the world would do with it, which is an ignorance that should be protected with fences and kindness. Jack wrote back that it was all right and that she had done no harm that had stuck, and he added that her eye was honest and if she wanted a job that didn\u2019t pay but did feed pie he could introduce her to a world where men wore ties and women carried the day and everyone needed someone who saw.\n\nThe meeting ran long because men liked to hear themselves explain why other people\u2019s needs were smaller when their own were big. Jack sat with his hands folded the way you fold them when you want to keep from pointing, and he unbent a finger only when he had to call a vote. He watched the board light up like a county fair sign and decided, for the hundredth time, that democracy was an ugly horse you kept because it brought you home, and he resisted the urge to use that phrasing in a sentence because he knew Mason would accuse him of writing bumper stickers. When it was over he was too tired to celebrate with grace, which is why the clementine in his pocket felt like mercy; peeling it arranged his mind as if he were proofing a page and discovering he had not committed libel.\n\nThere was a primary, and even though every woman in his office had assured him it would not generate the kind of heat that melts resolve, there was heat. A retired gym teacher who owned four shirts that all had the same idea about stripes declared he intended to take the district back from big-city concerns and also back from road diets and back from the absolute meltdown of manners he associated with men who refused to have lived exactly like his father. He raised money by selling yard signs with fonts that did violence to typography and by telling three cities\u2019 worth of lies about where Jack put his hand when no one was watching. Jack smiled the way you smile when most of the city is kind and part of it, as it must, is not, and he went to living rooms where a woman with a clutch of petitions always had her reading glasses on her head because she had long ago learned that glasses are a gesture as much as a device. He did the slow, ordinary holy work of elections: he asked for trust, he asked for time, he asked for patience, and he learned the names of two more cats and four more children and twelve more men who wanted to tell him about the day they had gone to jail because a police officer had had a bad morning.\n\nMason did not attend every living-room, because they were men who had jobs and a need to keep some air in them, but he came to the ones that mattered in a way you only learn to recognize if you have watched a person make choices over years. He stood by the mantel and made the room better by existing, and he introduced Jack not as a saint but as a man who tries, which is the most you can say and have it be both true and useful. He shook the hand of the retired gym teacher because a day without grace is a day that proves you are not listening to the river, and afterward he said, \u201cI cannot wait for the day when I am allowed to despise people in public,\u201d and Jack laughed so hard he had to sit down for a second on a couch that had been upholstered in the year of someone\u2019s birth.\n\nThe gym teacher conceded on a Tuesday around three, which is when concessions either mean something or don\u2019t, and then he called to accuse Jack of having cheated in a race that had been run in slow motion under three dozen eyes and a camera. Jack told him he had won because more people believed he was the one who would make the bus come on time, and the man said, \u201cI don\u2019t ride the bus,\u201d as if it were a confession of virtue rather than a failure of community. They hung up, and Mason wrote a sentence on the pad that read, Some people will be born atoms, which is the kind of scientific metaphor Jack had trained himself to accept without quibbling about physics in front of a pollster.\n\nOn the night of the concession, they went to a place with bad lighting and a jukebox that insisted on playing songs in the key of 1996. Their waitress wore hair like a siren and remembered every person who had ever tried to talk her into believing he was funny, and when she set their plates down she said, \u201cYou boys looked like a before and after but I can\u2019t tell which one is which,\u201d and she winked as if to tell them not to waste time trying to be cleverer than hunger. They ate with their heads close because noise requires strategy, and afterward they walked to the river because nothing else made sense. The bridge hummed. The water said nothing it hadn\u2019t said last night, which is how you trust it. They stood and let the cold make them aware of their wrists, which had learned each other like streets they knew they could navigate in the dark without running the stop sign.\n\n\u201cAre we brave enough to be boring,\u201d Mason asked, and it was only half a joke because boredom is a solid, noble goal when your days have insisted on performing for an audience. \u201cCan we be men who go home and turn on a television show and yell at the commercials like my grandfather and allow our bodies to be furniture next to each other without making it into a statement?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe built a lock and a room,\u201d Jack said, and he used the hand that was free to balance the coin on two fingers, a cheap trick he was finally getting good at. \u201cWe let people into the hallway. That feels like a compromise I can stand in. I can be on the sofa because I am going to the meeting in the morning, and you can send me three photographs of your ridiculous coffee stand and I will not pretend to be above being charmed.\u201d\n\nThey did go home and be furniture. They watched a show about a hospital where no one should have been allowed to practice medicine, and Jack learned he was the kind of person who yells at fictional doctors about sanitation. He let his head fall back during the second commercial and allowed himself to notice the weight of Mason\u2019s leg pressed against his without making it into a speech. Outside the window, the city was being polite about noise for once, as if it had remembered pace is not always a war. Inside, his phone did what phones do and tried to convince him that attention is the same as care, and he turned it face down and discovered it was easier than he had thought. He fell asleep halfway through a storyline about a man who never learned, and he woke with the coin under his palm and a neck that would require apology and three ibuprofen to forgive him.\n\nSpring turned itself over and showed its underside, which was pollen and loud birds and the structural integrity of hope. The white dog had a puppy show up beside him for two mornings in a row, and then an old woman in a jacket that had the dignity of wool came to collect it because it had jumped her tiny fence and was too sure of its right to happiness for its own good. The boy with the scar came to the office with a backpack and an appointment for what he called a \u201cshadow day,\u201d which he interpreted as an opportunity to be more honest than he needed to and to call strangers sir in a way that made them feel both seventy and blessed. Ms. Pettigrew introduced herself to a donor on the elevator with the kind of handshake that made a donor remember his teacher\u2019s name and his college debt, and later the donor wrote a check and called it a gift, which it was, and also a tax decision, which it was too.\n\nOn a Friday so clean it looked like it had been polished by an older aunt, they took the train north not because they had to but because they had decided they were allowed. They walked a mile to a museum that had an exhibit about maps and how the people who draw them are always admitting a bias and asking you to pretend they haven\u2019t. They read plaques that were the same size as the plaques at home and did not use words more honest than the ones they used at home, and they stood in front of a painting of a river that had been made by a man who had never seen their river and who nevertheless had understood how to make light argument with dark without declaring victory. They went to a diner that had reinvented itself as something else and decided to pretend not to notice except to ask for more salt, and afterward they walked down a block that had seen five revolutions and named none of them correctly. On the train back, Mason leaned his head against the window and counted the minutes the way you count when you are persuading yourself time is an accomplice and not a thief, and Jack watched the trees go by with a gratitude that had less to do with the trees than with the simple fact of being in a seat next to the person he wanted to be next to when the world was boring.\n\nBy summer, the boys on the rocks drew different names and harder lines, and the graffiti had learned a new hand that loved serpentines and words that curled into themselves like rope. The heat made the office hold smells more closely than it had any right to, and the pie, when it came, arrived with a resigned air as if it understood keeping its texture was a losing battle it would fight anyway. The white dog shed into a visible cloud you could have taken a handful of and made into a small sweater, and the man who seemed to belong to the dog installed himself under the elm on the corner like a benevolent monarch who refused to sit on the throne and instead asked to be consulted in the ordinary way. Ms. Pettigrew bought a fan and put it in the window, and her hat became a summer hat and then an argument with heat, and the boy with the scar took it upon himself to correct three men about the route change with a politeness that was so sharp it left them surprised they were bleeding.\n\nThey had a fight one night, and the fight was about nothing and also about the loop that anger can get into when it has no place to be placed. It began with a tie and the correct angle of a knot and moved with ruthless efficiency to the proper use of a word, and then Mason did the thing where he made a joke to keep the ceiling from falling and Jack refused to catch it because he wanted the ceiling to admit it had been creaking. They were careful not to be unkind because they were men who had learned unkindness spills and ruins the shoes you need for work, but they did raise their voices and then lower them because the building was old and had learned too many secrets already. It ended not with a kiss because they were stupid in exactly the proper way, but with a clementine, because idiocy should be fed and not taught to fight on an empty stomach. Jack peeled one half and handed it across the line they had drawn and Mason took it and said, \u201cWe need to write a rule about what happens when we both want to be the person who gets to be right,\u201d and Jack said, \u201cWe write two rules, and we change which one we use every other Thursday,\u201d and then they laughed because the sentence had rescued them, and then they touched the back of each other\u2019s wrists because touching wrists had become a religion they could practice without anyone outside reading their hymn book.\n\nWhen Mason\u2019s six months were up, the letter he sent to D.C. was not a resignation and not a recommitment. He wrote in a voice they had taught him to use, one that sounded as if he trusted the reader to be a person and not just a position. He said he wanted the work when it worked and wanted the river when it did not and that he refused to apologize for wanting both. He said he would keep his apartment and his space and his keys and that he would learn again the names of the three women who run the city and pretend the men do, because names are the most important currency in a town like theirs. He said he would go north when it served the work and south when the work demanded it and that no part of that sentence furnished anyone with permission to demand more. When he read it to Jack on the sofa that had finally learned the exact shape of their two bodies sitting at their favorite distance, Jack said, \u201cThis is honest enough to be impolite,\u201d and Mason said, \u201cThen it\u2019s useful,\u201d and they decided to mail it not because they believed in the mail but because they liked the weight of a thing landing on a desk without a chime.\n\nThe white dog was there the morning they found out the letter had been accepted, woofless as a benediction. Ms. Pettigrew called to say the boy had been hired to announce the stops on the summer rec bus because someone at Operations had a sense of humor and a respect for lunacy, and the boy came by to practice his voice with a solemnity that made him into a man for five minutes and then back into a child who had invented public transit. Jack\u2019s mother made sandwiches that were as ugly as sin and better for it and brought them in a bag as if she were a deliverer of mercy and not a woman who had taught herself the routes to the buildings she used to think were not for her. The mayor sent a text with a confetti emoji he misused in a way that made the confetti a truce and not a party, and Mr. Halloran\u2019s assistant sent a sentence that both congratulated them and reminded them the streetlight poles would not buy themselves.\n\nThey celebrated by not celebrating, because gratitude is easier for them when it looks like ordinary time. They walked by the mural where the women had learned to smirk in a way that frightened men into admiring them, and they got coffee so bad it tasted like nostalgia, and they argued about whether to replace the filing cabinet that stuck, and they did none of the grand things that television men think men do when the world gives them a portion of their own desire. In the office, the coin and the clementine sat next to each other like a joke they could always tell, and Jack said, \u201cProof,\u201d and Mason said, \u201cProof,\u201d and the building consented to be the kind of structure that held their weight without noticing it was doing so on purpose.",

                              "content": "The first time he saw the Capitol rise out of the fog like a ghost ship, Jack was ten and miserable in a too-tight shirt. His mother had dragged him and his sister to a school tour where a docent in a blue blazer explained that the building was designed by Jefferson, modeled after a Roman temple. He liked the way she said those things, the calm certainty, and he liked the ramp that let you roll a quarter downhill, sending it flickering like a startled fish into your palm. He didn\u2019t like the way his collar scratched his throat.\n\nYears later he learned that many truths came wrapped in scratchy collars. He learned to live with it.\n\nBy thirty-five the Capitol was simply there when he rose early and drove in with the news radio low, the river a black seam at the edge of the city, the lights on Ninth Street blinking yellow in the empty dawn. He stood some mornings at the back steps, drinking coffee that tasted like pennies, and watched stray cats slink along the brick. He nodded to custodians. He carried a leather portfolio his sister had given him when he\u2019d won the special election, as if the object could stitch him up into a certain man.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t certain.\n\n\u201cDelegate Crowder?\u201d The security guard with the bored eyes and gentle baritone called from the desk. \u201cYou forgot your badge yesterday. Again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, Warren,\u201d Jack said. He smiled that careful smile people had told him looked good in photos, surprised to find that, this morning, it also worked in his face. He clipped the badge to his lapel. In the low windows the white columns were faint through the trees, the steps worn smooth with all the wishful and angry feet.\n\nHe went upstairs. The office smelled like printer toner and clementines, because Mason had a habit of buying a huge bag of clementines in December and then eating them all by himself, leaving their skins curled like orange quotation marks in the trash.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Mason said without looking up. He was typing with two fingers. He always looked like this on a morning when Jack knew the day would be long\u2014shirt sleeves rolled twice, tie loosened, flinty eyes soft and over-caffeinated. The color in Mason\u2019s eyes was a thing you couldn\u2019t capture exactly; sometimes it was straight slate, sometimes it had a greenish halo, like the ring in the river where eddies formed around rocks. \u201cYou\u2019re early. Good. We\u2019ve got Ms. Pettigrew at eight\u2014bus routes again\u2014and then Channel 12 wants ten minutes before lunch on the tax credit. Also:\u201d here he finally looked up, fingers still on keys, face not careful at all, because with him it never needed to be, \u201cYour mother called. Twice.\u201d\n\n\u201cTerrible new development,\u201d Jack said. He set the coffee cup down on the desk, missing a stack of mail by a miracle. \u201cWe must legislate immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou going to call her back?\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter nine,\u201d he said, and took a breath, long like a swimmer. \u201cIf you remind me.\u201d\n\n\u201cReminding is literally my job,\u201d Mason said in the tone that somehow managed to be both caustic and fond. He slid an envelope across the desk. \u201cAlso, this.\u201d\n\nJack picked it up. The weight of certain kinds of paper. He knew what it was before he saw the letterhead: a donor who wished to remind him their generosity was tied to a specific vision of the world. He tucked it into the portfolio, feeling the heat rise in his face, replaced by the practiced cool. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk to them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk.\u201d\n\nMason nodded as if he had expected nothing else. He returned his gaze to the screen. He had that way of making quiet feel like some kind of pact.\n\nThey\u2019d met when they were kids, but not the way people tell it, not with a fistfight and a reconciliation, not with instant recognition. They had been assigned to the same table in middle school science, where the teacher kept a fish tank on the counter that made everyone have to pee. Mason had a notebook full of sloppy stars. Jack had a binder his mother had labeled for him. They shared a pizza on Fridays sometimes, in seventh grade, with three other boys who went on to light things on fire and get very good at throwing a football. They learned each other in layers, the way you learn the city. The place where the sidewalk buckled by the old elm. The alley with the sweet gum that dripped beads of amber. The tiny bakery that made a liar out of your budget and your intentions.\n\nHigh school tightened certain ways around them. Mason\u2019s father took off. Jack\u2019s father had already gone. They found each other at study hall and the smoking area they didn\u2019t smoke in and the decaying baseball diamond that no one\u2019s parents wanted to fix. They would lie on their backs and look at planes and tell each other lies. The lies were the seams inside truth: \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s just go,\u201d said with a laugh, said with the exact right amount of weight to let the words float.\n\nAfter college Jack had come back and worked as a policy analyst for a nonprofit until he was tired of writing other people\u2019s speeches. He saw the vacancy open when a longtime delegate shuffled into retirement, and it was like a shout inside him. He called Mason without thinking\u2014because that was the habit\u2014and Mason said, \u201cOkay, so, then you\u2019re going to run.\u201d\n\nThey were older but not old. Mason had been a reporter for a while, a midnight DJ for much longer, a bartender in a place whose lights were so dim your eyes turned to hands and felt their way around faces. He knew what people said when they thought no one important could hear them. He knew how to write sentences that were not pretty but would swing their weight at a crowd and hit something.\n\nOn the day Jack announced in Monroe Park, with brittle leaves and someone\u2019s dog barking absurdly at the statue of a horse without its rider, he felt the first small catch in his throat when he was trying to say the word \u201chome.\u201d He said it wrong. No one noticed. Mason did.\n\nAfter that, the years flattened and stretched like roads. Jack learned posture and patience and which elevators could be counted on to shut without trying to crush you. He learned he could live with sleep in six small doses and that, sometimes, compromise meant you got something instead of nothing. He also learned that Mason had three different smiles: the good one, where his left dimple crumpled, the fake one he used when he was so tired of someone he would rather eat paper than listen, and the small one he kept like a secret, which showed exactly one tooth and made Jack want to leave the room, just in case anyone could see the way it wrecked him.\n\nHe could have said that last part out loud, some nights, in the elevator that carried them down to where the cars waited like obedient animals, or in the corner booth at Millie\u2019s where the waitress knew that Mason would ask for extra hot sauce and that Jack would pick broccoli out of his omelet. He held it instead like a coin in his mouth. He held it until it melted, until he couldn\u2019t tell if it was the coin that burned or his tongue.\n\nThe day moved like any other. It was winter, which in Richmond meant a sympathizer\u2019s cold \u2014willing, but not committed. Ms. Pettigrew arrived composed and trembling, because she was like that, because she had grandchildren who waited forty-five minutes for one bus and then had to sprint to catch the transfer to the second. She wore a church hat. She never took the hat off, but she took off each fact and set it on the desk: times, intersections, dates. Mason leaned forward and asked questions like he was building a small bridge.\n\nLater, when she left, flattening a gloved hand on Jack\u2019s as if to anchor him to her insistence, Jack stood in the doorway watching the hallway fill with staffers, lobbyists, school groups with bright lanyards. He felt it then: love as the pressure at the center of his chest. Not the love that made headlines, not the love his donors put on brochures with soft-focus families on the cover. The kind of love that made him say yes to sitting in rooms where people talked themselves into circles, just to pull the line straight again. The kind that made him look at Mason and see\u2014he refused the word fate, because he\u2019d been taught to be suspicious of easy language. But. But.\n\n\u201cYou had the pivot, but you didn\u2019t take it,\u201d Mason said, coming to stand beside him, shoulder just not touching the frame of the door, the smell of clementines threaded through like an indecent thought.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Jack said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll take it next time,\u201d Mason said. He meant it like he meant all things\u2014with accuracy, with confidence that could be mistaken for cruelty if you didn\u2019t know him. Jack had known him long enough to see the shadow of fear behind that confidence. He had known him long enough to keep it a secret.\n\n\u201cLunch?\u201d Jack said.\n\n\u201cAt noon we\u2019re doing ten with Channel 12\u2014don\u2019t say the word fairness; they\u2019ll trap you with it\u2014and then I guess we can do lunch if by lunch you mean protein bars and a shared bag of chips.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou used to dream,\u201d Jack said.\n\n\u201cI upgraded. I dream in bullet points. It\u2019s very efficient.\u201d\n\nWhen the camera crew arrived, and the reporter\u2014thin jacket, chapped cheeks\u2014asked her questions and then asked the question that was not on the list, about the rumor that a certain caucus would withhold support, Jack did the thing he was good at: He stood very still. He did not blink too fast. He acknowledged the premise. He gave the pivot Mason had placed under his tongue like a communion wafer. He smiled just so. Later, in the car, he let his head slide against the fogged window and whispered, \u201cI lied.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou avoided a trap,\u201d Mason said. \u201cEvaded. Boy-scouted your way around it. Can we drop you at the committee room? I\u2019ve got to run across town to the school board office and will swing back before the caucus meets.\u201d\n\nJack nodded, and Mason turned the radio low. The air between them hummed the way it always did when they had gotten through something all right. The peace after a fight won in the last yard. The humming same as summer cicadas, only colder.\n\n\u201cYou want to stop at the river later?\u201d Mason said as they idled at a light. \u201cAfter. It\u2019s a day for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always say that,\u201d Jack said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always true.\u201d\n\nHe thought of the river as the place their friendship lived in its purest form. As if something in them ran exactly that way\u2014fast and slow at once, threaded silk suddenly frothing, rocks that looked like whales when you were young. Boys had jumped there with terrible bravado. Another boy had broken his arm. Boys, when they were trying to be men, had gone there to kiss men in the dark and then returned to their girlfriends with abject, certain hands. Jack had not been that boy. He had been, he tells himself, careful. But the river knew him anyway. It knew his ankles and his compromises, his way of saying yes too many times in a row and then being washed out by the sudden word no.\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMaybe is a yes that needs a nap,\u201d Mason said, and then the light turned and they went.\n\nIn the committee room, a delegate with a mustache like a small animal lectured the room about sin in the tones of a man who hid a picture of himself in a drawer that would be embarrassing to show his grandson. Jack nodded when people spoke and wrote in the margins: Look up numbers. He wasn\u2019t always the thing he performed. He knew the shapes people required, but he wanted to know what the numbers did when they ran into each other, what the lines did when they crossed in the middle like a kiss.\n\nWhen he was done, when the afternoon was thinner and the sun low in the slats of the blinds, he went back to the office. Mason was there on the floor, cross-legged in his tie, papers spread like an unruly deck of cards, phone under his chin. He was trying, Jack could tell, to persuade someone not to do something stupid to themselves in public. His voice had that brightness like the rim of a glass, almost too sharp. \u201cI hear you,\u201d he was saying, making a small motion at Jack to sit. \u201cBut we both know\u2014no, we do know, come on, I\u2019ve known you since you were beating me at community trivia nights, which is to say I know you hate this idea.\u201d Then: \u201cUh-huh. Okay. Okay. Give me an hour and then I\u2019ll call you back.\u201d He smiled, the smallest one. He ended the call with a soft exhale like he\u2019d just stepped off a curb without falling.\n\n\u201cWho was that?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone who wants to make a statement outside the caucus dinner that would probably solve their short-term problem and set their car on fire long-term. We\u2019re going to fix it with pie.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou believe in pie a lot,\u201d Jack said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because pie is one of the only true things left to us in this world. Also, they make a chocolate chess you\u2019d leave me for.\u201d\n\nJack was silent. He looked at the curve of Mason\u2019s wrist where the cuff had slipped back, and he thought something unprintable. He said, instead, \u201cI\u2019m never leaving you.\u201d\n\nMason looked up, quickly, face opened. Not opened like hope. Opened like a reflex, like surprise that hurt. \u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause who would tell you when you\u2019re about to sound like a person who has never met an actual human? Who would keep clementines in season and almonds when they\u2019re not?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho indeed,\u201d Jack said, and the room seemed to tilt, just a degree, like a boat catching a new current. He set his portfolio down very carefully on the desk, then needed to put his hands somewhere. He slid them into his pockets. He could feel the coin he\u2019d carried for years: the marble one from the dome. He rolled it with his thumb until the edges gave him a map.\n\nThey went to the dinner, which was fluorescent and acrid and full of the kind of earnest conversation that wears you out. They steered a man toward pie and obscurity. They stood in a hallway with a woman from the teachers\u2019 union and promised not to forget her. When the crowd thinned and the chairs were exhausted and a janitor began stacking them with a bored clang, Mason looked at him and tilted his chin toward the door.\n\n\u201cNow?\u201d Jack said.\n\n\u201cNow.\u201d\n\nThey drove to the river, to the place below the bridge where the rocks lay like cows in a pasture. The air cut his cheeks when he got out. He was suddenly aware of all the ways he had learned to move through rooms and how none of those movements worked here. The river made everyone awkward again. It was good that way.\n\nThey walked until the path narrowed and then widened and the graffiti on the concrete feasted on color. PURPLE SKUNKS FOR GOV. Names and dates, lovers exalting their perfect and temporary graffiti selves, someone who had drawn a cartoon of a possum with a crown. Mason touched the crown and laughed. Maybe he said something. The river louded, made words optional.\n\nOn the rocks the cold ran up through the soles of their shoes, insisting. They sat with their knees taken away from each other at first, then closer, then aligned like they had always been built to stack just so.\n\n\u201cSometimes I think about what you\u2019d be doing if you hadn\u2019t run,\u201d Mason said. The sky made a soundless declaration of winter above them. \u201cProbably you\u2019d be running something else.\u201d\n\n\u201cA bagel shop,\u201d Jack said.\n\n\u201cGod, you\u2019d be the worst bagel shop owner. You\u2019d give away everything. Here, ma\u2019am, take these bagels, take my shirt, take my\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Jack said, laughing, both hands up. \u201cStop before we lose all our points with heaven.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost too late for you anyway,\u201d Mason said, then looked at him, eyes not flinty now but wet silver. He wanted, Jack thought, to say a thing and didn\u2019t know how to land it. He watched the thought float around Mason\u2019s head like a drunk moth. He waited for it to land on his sleeve.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Mason said, and lay back on the rock. He stared up as if there were an answer there. \u201cJust. The way you carry this with your whole body. Sometimes I think: put it down, Jack. Let me pick it up for a while. I\u2019m strong enough. I don\u2019t mind the weight.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean the district? Do you mean the world?\u201d He wanted to add Do you mean me.\n\nMason squinted. \u201cYes. Also no. Stop making me define my terms.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were a reporter,\u201d Jack said. \u201cIt\u2019s literally your job.\u201d\n\nMason huffed. \u201cI was a terrible reporter. I fell in love with too many people.\u201d He threw an arm over his eyes. \u201cNot like that. Not like that,\u201d he said again quickly, voice sudden as a scraped knee. \u201cJust. Everyone looked so like someone who was going to outsmart their life, and then.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then,\u201d Jack said, because he knew how that sentence ended.\n\nThey were both quiet. The river did its old work. A runner passed, breath a ghost behind him. Somewhere a child insisted on being carried and was refused and then was carried. Jack pulled his coat tighter. He knew what he wanted to say. It was there like a dark fruit hanging just above reach. He could stand. He could reach. He could break off the stem and eat and let it stain him.\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d he began, and Mason turned his face toward him, and Jack lost the second half of the sentence wholly and without hope. He switched lanes. \u201cWe should revisit the transit language. You were right about the verb. It should be expand, not enhance. Enhance sounds like what you do to a photo of a sandwich.\u201d\n\nMason let out a breath he had been holding. \u201cGod, yes,\u201d he said, laughing from relief. He sat up, shivering a little. \u201cI knew we were in trouble. You almost said something like \u2018synergy.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI would never.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have.\u201d\n\nJack made a face. \u201cI would never on purpose.\u201d\n\nThey walked back under the bridge. Mason\u2019s shoulder bumped his and then didn\u2019t. There are whole languages of touch that never need a grammar. On the way up to the lot, Mason fished in his coat. \u201cI think I\u2019ve got another clementine,\u201d he said, and came up triumphant, the tiny orange the color of a child\u2019s toy. He held it up. \u201cFor you or for me?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor you,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou stole the last cookie at that meeting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was a cracked cookie,\u201d Mason said, already peeling. \u201cCracked cookies aren\u2019t real cookies. They\u2019re ethics assignments with sugar.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways with the ethics,\u201d Jack said, quiet, too quiet, because the word caught at something. It scraped on something that had been smooth only because of careful sanding down.\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Mason\u2019s eyes were on him. Immediate. That commonness between them like a shared coat.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Jack said automatically, then took the clementine piece Mason offered. It burst in his mouth, too sweet. He swallowed. He breathed. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said again, and felt both the truth and the lie of it in his chest, like a coin rolling in a bowl.\n\nHis mother called again that night. He answered and leaned in the kitchen door with his forehead against the cool painted wood and listened as she told him about the neighbor\u2019s new fence, which was an abomination, and the recipe she had tried that would be better if you doubled the garlic. She asked, only once, if he was eating, if he was sleeping. He said yes to both, because these were the easy lies, because these were the lies that kept people from crying on the phone. He thought of the hat Ms. Pettigrew had not removed. He thought of the weight of envelopes. He thought of the river making a covenant with itself to return to the sea.\n\nWhen he hung up, the apartment was quiet in the way that meant someone else had just turned off their TV and the building was acclimating to the new lack. He poured a glass of water and drank half and left the glass on the counter with a ring of sweat like a lesson. He sat at the little table not quite big enough for company and took the marble coin from his pocket and set it on the wood. He never told anyone where he got it. He never told anyone who he wanted to be when he held it tight.\n\nMason texted: \u201cYour answers tonight were clean. You probably saved us three thousand phone calls.\u201d\n\nHe typed and deleted. He typed and deleted. He typed: \u201cYou did all the work.\u201d\n\nMason wrote: \u201cWe\u2019re a team. Don\u2019t go soft on me after midnight.\u201d\n\nJack stared at that. The words were not romantic ones. They weren\u2019t even kind in the way people recognized. But his heart pulled in his chest as if someone had tied a ribbon and yanked. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBreakfast with Wyatt?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Mason wrote. \u201cThe place on Broad. Also the city\u2019s pretending it might snow. You might have to be photographed in a very serious coat.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay God grant me the composure to resist the serious coat picture.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnlikely,\u201d Mason wrote. \u201cSleep. For once.\u201d\n\nHe turned his phone facedown and then couldn\u2019t stand it and turned it faceup again, as if it were a body he had to be certain kept breathing. He wanted to write the thing\u2014he always wanted to write the thing. He wanted to say, with that scary plainness he admired in the hard women from Gillies Creek who didn\u2019t ask anyone\u2019s permission to speak: I am the man who waits for your text even when I\u2019m sitting across from you. I am the man who thinks of you when he hears the garbage truck. I am the one who wants to take your tie off and fold it because I know you\u2019ll wad it in your pocket and ruin it. He wanted to say it and he wanted to turn off his phone and walk into a different life.\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d he told himself, not for the first time. He had a voice he used on himself that was both his own and not. \u201cStop and go to bed.\u201d\n\nIn the morning, the city was doing that hesitant winter thing where it threatened snow and then didn\u2019t deliver, the air chalky with intent. He dressed in a dark suit and the scarf his sister had given him for Christmas that had been chosen by his niece and therefore had small embroidered whales on the ends. He liked the whales. They made people smile and then give him more of themselves than they meant to.\n\nAt Wyatt\u2019s, with the clatter and the heavy smell of butter and coffee, they slid into a booth. The waitress came and smacked down two mugs like cards. \u201cSugar?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAlways,\u201d Mason said. \u201cBring us whatever you think we deserve.\u201d\n\nShe snorted and left. Mason had that effect on service professionals: they either adored him or tried to murder him with their eyes. \u201cWe should get ahead of the property tax thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going away, even if it\u2019s dumb. Also, be prepared: I heard there\u2019s a rumor about you and that yoga instructor from Carytown.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no yoga instructor from Carytown,\u201d Jack said.\n\n\u201cI know that and you know that but some people need their lies to come with mats.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d Jack said, the word too sharp. \u201cWho\u2019s spreading it?\u201d\n\nMason waved a hand. \u201cIrrelevant. We starve it. Don\u2019t give it air. We say, \u2018His schedule doesn\u2019t allow for yoga,\u2019 and then we talk about potholes. People like potholes. They can see them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a genius,\u201d Jack said.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m an old bartender,\u201d Mason said. \u201cPeople tell me what they really want when they think I\u2019m not staring.\u201d\n\nThe door chimes tinkled. A councilman they both knew nodded at them and then made a show of ignoring them demonstrably. Jack felt the fatigue slide into his bones. Politicians were like actors who refused to break character while they were buying detergent. It was exhausting even to watch.\n\n\u201cWhat was the thing you almost said last night?\u201d Mason asked abruptly, setting his mug down too hard, sloshing coffee, and then reaching for napkins with the frantic precision of a man who refuses to stain.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou almost said something and then you said \u2018transit verbs\u2019 and saved us both. What was it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Jack said, and his tone betrayed him, that thing he couldn\u2019t quite file off no matter how he smoothed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything.\u201d\n\nMason didn\u2019t lean in, didn\u2019t push. He looked past Jack to the window where an old man was arguing lovingly with his dog. His jaw worked the way it did when he couldn\u2019t decide whether to fight or make a joke. He chose the joke. \u201cWell, if it was a compliment about my hair, you can save it. I already know I\u2019m a tragic figure in winter humidity.\u201d\n\nJack laughed and dissolved and refused himself. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about your hair,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was about\u2014\u201d\n\nTheir waitress arrived with a plate of biscuits and the decision was carried away on the smell of butter and smoke.\n\nThe days stacked. The colors changed in the windows. They lived inside the rhythm that kept them together without saying the name of it. Jack learned to disappear into the crowd and be seen. He learned which elevators were for someone else. He learned that every time Mason brushed past him in the hall he felt the heat coordinate his muscles into readiness, some part of him living six inches to the left of his body, where touch was an event and not a theory.\n\nThere were nights. There were the nights when they went to community meetings in rooms that smelled like old trophies and heard men stand and say the word \u201ctransparency\u201d like it was a hymn. There were the nights when someone cried in a folding chair, when someone sat very still with folded hands because they had been taught from birth not to take up space and could not unlearn it at thirty-six. There were the nights they went to a neighborhood on the south side where the streetlights did not exist in a hopeful sense, and they walked, and a boy in a black hoodie said, \u201cYo, that your man?\u201d with a grin like a dare. Jack said, \u201cHe is,\u201d too quickly, and Mason looked at the ground and grinned to himself and threw his empty coffee cup into a trash can from five feet away and missed.\n\nThere was a night the power went out and the city screamed, not from terror but annoyance, and they worked by lamplight in his apartment, and the lamplight made Mason\u2019s face look like a painting you might find in an attic, something someone loved and hid. He fell asleep on the sofa, one arm thrown over his head, his mouth at an angle that made him look young. Jack watched him because he couldn\u2019t not. He covered him with a blanket. He sat there on the opposite chair and let the room go quiet around them, and the only sound was the tick of the building settling into itself and Mason\u2019s even sleeping breath, and something loosened that would not be tightened again.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said into the lamplight, meaning very many things. The lamp didn\u2019t answer, having the good sense not to.\n\nIn the morning, Mason woke and scolded him for not sleeping and made eggs in a pan that was too small, and the smell lifted his heart and broke it.\n\nA week later, Jack stood in front of a little TV camera to talk about the tax credit again and he could see in the periphery that Mason had chosen the tie he always told him made him look like he had a plan. He held his place in the script without looking. He said the number. He said it again. He smiled and said, \u201cWe can do better,\u201d and watched the anchor\u2019s face bend to the shape of that hope and had the inappropriate thought that maybe he could live in this in-between forever, that maybe he could live in the long hallway where he did not say and Mason did not ask.\n\nHe knew that wasn\u2019t how this went. He knew, in his bones, that the hallway ended. He could not see the door yet. It was there anyway.\n\nAfter they packed up that day, after the papers went back into their folders and the coffee cups went to die in the recycling bin that didn\u2019t later recycle anything, Mason leaned in the door and said, abruptly, as if it hurt, \u201cYou know I love you, right?\u201d\n\nIt was a joke made in a tone that one might use to tell a dog it was beautiful. It was both a joke and not. Jack looked up. The room stretched very far away from him. The floor became a field, the windows open to winter. He said, without thinking, \u201cI know,\u201d which was the right and wrong answer, which was the only thing he could have said without making the ceiling come down with too much honesty.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Mason said, and looked down at his hands as if they had embarrassed him. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want you to forget.\u201d\n\n\u201cForget?\u201d The word was too strange on his tongue. \u201cHow would I\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mother always liked me better,\u201d Mason said, and there it was: the dodge, wearing a bright little hat. He pushed off the door frame. \u201cI\u2019m going to get you a salad you won\u2019t eat.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet me something real,\u201d Jack said, but his heart was making a noise he didn\u2019t recognize. \u201cGet me a cookie.\u201d\n\n\u201cCracked cookie,\u201d Mason said over his shoulder. \u201cEthics assignment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhole cookie, then,\u201d Jack called, and the door clicked shut like a day finishing.\n\nHe sat for a second in the fluttering silence, papers sighing faintly. He could feel everything he had not said standing there in the room, looking out the window, checking their phones. He could feel the river moving under the floorboards.\n\nHe picked up a pen. He wrote the word expand on a sticky note. He stuck it to the corner of the computer, pale yellow with his slanted, overly careful letters. He could have written a thousand words that afternoon and none of them would have been the one he needed.\n\nThat night, when the cold was real for once and the prediction of snow came through as an honest, hesitant dusting, he walked home. He could have called for a ride, but he wanted the walk, the way it let his brain unwind, his shoes making civilized small noises on the sidewalk. A woman passed him with a baby zipped into her coat like a kangaroo. He said hello. She said, \u201cStay warm, baby,\u201d and he felt the startling goodness of strangers wash him.\n\nThe city changed when it pretended to be someplace else, transformed by weather into a town out of a movie where people got stuck on trains and had to kiss before dawn. He turned at the corner where there was a mural of a woman who looked like someone\u2019s aunt, hair rolled just so, laughing into a sun that did not need to be real to give them light. He walked up three flights. He turned his key. He stood in the doorway, listening to his apartment remember it was his.\n\nHe thought of the workshop he had taken once\u2014how he had needed it like a hamster needs a wheel, busy but not necessary\u2014where the teacher had said, \u201cThe first chapter is the whole book in miniature,\u201d and he had rolled his eyes because he was not twenty and could not afford the earnestness of absolutes. He thought, now, standing barefoot on his kitchen tile, of that certainty. He thought: It is all here. The city and the cold and the boy who said I know and the boy who said good and the river. The river under everything. He poured himself a glass of water and drank it, and drank it, and then set the empty glass next to the first, collected evidence.\n\nHe slept. He dreamed in bullet points and whales and the chalky taste of snow. He woke and watched the light move slow around the edges of the blinds and thought, for a second, this is the day I will choose to be brave. Then his phone vibrated like a heart and the day was the day, was the day, was only a day again, asking him the usual things\u2014show up, speak, smile, lift, carry, compromise.\n\nMason texted: \u201cThere\u2019s an early hearing on the zoning thing. Can you be there? Also wear the serious coat. It\u2019s your destiny.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy destiny is my nose getting red,\u201d Jack wrote.\n\n\u201cThen destiny shapeshifts,\u201d Mason wrote. \u201cBring tissues. You always forget.\u201d He added a photograph he had taken and not meant to\u2014Jack laughing, head tipped back, eyes closed, the river behind him a slow band of polished pewter. It wasn\u2019t a good photo, technically; it was crooked and the light was allergic to flattery and Jack wanted to rip it off his screen and shove it into his chest and carry it around until it bent. He didn\u2019t know whether to be grateful or furious. He wrote, carefully: \u201cWhen did you take that?\u201d\n\n\u201cLast week,\u201d Mason said. \u201cYou were saying something mean about bacon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would never,\u201d Jack wrote. He thought to say it. He thought to say it for real, openly, with both hands. He was not brave today either. He wrote: \u201cYou\u2019re a menace,\u201d which, between them, already meant: Stay. Which already meant: Don\u2019t go too far away. Which already meant the thing he couldn\u2019t say.\n\nHe put on the serious coat. He went downstairs. He breathed the air, clean and hurtful, and watched his breath go up like a suggestion. He walked toward the Capitol that lifted behind the trees like a memory of a promise, and he thought: maybe the second chapter will be easier, which he knew was a lie, which he said anyway, because he believed in small mercies, in temporary hope, in getting through the day without breaking. In clementines in winter. In whole cookies when you had earned them and when you had not.\n\nBefore the hearing, standing by the window while the clerk arranged papers that would be mislaid by lunch, Mason came to stand too close at his elbow. They watched a white dog gallop unsupervised across the snowy lawn, delighted with its own ungovernable motion. \u201cThat\u2019s you,\u201d Mason said. \u201cThat dumb dog. So pleased to be alive he forgets to look where he\u2019s going.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re the guy yelling at the dog to come back.\u201d\n\nMason made the small smile. \u201cI\u2019m the guy carrying the leash and pretending it\u2019s not mine.\u201d He bumped Jack\u2019s arm with his once, twice. The motion was nothing and everything. \u201cLet\u2019s give them the better verb,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s do the boring thing and call it a win, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Jack said carefully, because it was all he could do. He didn\u2019t look at Mason. He did not move his arm away.\n\nThe hearing was the hearing. People mispronounced his name and then apologized. People said his name with love as if it would soften the thing they wanted. He made his voice lower because people listen more when a low voice tells them what they needed was already what they wanted. He left the hearing more awake and more tired than when he had arrived, which was the default. They walked out together at noon and the sun was making treacherous promises with the snow.\n\n\u201cYou eating?\u201d Mason asked.\n\n\u201cIs this real lunch or ethics lunch?\u201d\n\n\u201cReal lunch, for once, if we can get to it. If you answer any calls in the next twenty minutes I\u2019ll glue your phone to a pigeon and let it fly into the river.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like how you think my phone is capable of flight.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is capable of flight under the right conditions,\u201d Mason murmured, not really to him, maybe to himself. He watched the woman with the baby at the bus stop pull the blanket higher. \u201cYou know that. You always knew.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre we talking about physics or hope?\u201d Jack said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about wanting things,\u201d Mason said softly. He rubbed his thumb along the seam of his coat pocket, the motion tiny and frantic. He looked down at their shoes. He went on in a voice like a neutral news anchor would use to deliver a devastating piece of information about an earthquake: \u201cI need to tell you something and I don\u2019t know how to do it without sounding like a headline.\u201d\n\nJack felt the air leave. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, and he was smiling, and it wasn\u2019t a practiced smile, it was the kind of smile you make when someone pushes you into a pool and you\u2019re pretending you didn\u2019t just swallow chlorinated water.\n\n\u201cNot now,\u201d Mason said, rolling his eyes at himself. \u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014it can wait. It shouldn\u2019t, but it can. Lunch first. Then ruin something.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Jack said, because ruin sounded like an honest word, and he preferred those. He matched his pace to Mason\u2019s, which was not a thing he admitted to doing aloud, and they moved along the sidewalk together, briefly in step, briefly without the push and pull of the building behind them, briefly only two men in coats, the world flecked with white, the river invisible and nevertheless under their feet, running on and on toward the mouth where it would be lost and find itself again.",

                              "content": "They chose lunch at the place with the plastic plants and the slow-circling ceiling fans that made every conversation sound like it had been softened with a thumb. It was the kind of restaurant that had been itself for so long it was impervious to trends, the kind where the waitress addressed them as \u201cyou two\u201d and refilled their water without being asked. Mason ordered the stew that stained your lips if you weren\u2019t careful. Jack ordered a grilled cheese like a child because he was exhausted enough to want to be taken care of and because he\u2019d learned that sometimes you got stronger if you let yourself be small for a minute. The windows were fogged in at their edges where the snow outside auditioned for real weather and failed charmingly. Mason took off his coat but left his scarf looped, an uncharacteristic indecision he disguised by joking with the waitress about the way the word plantain made people confess their childhoods.\n\nThey did the first ten minutes the way they always did, in a litany that anchored them to the ordinary. There were committee rumors and a water main break on Leigh Street and a man who had written four emails at midnight explaining how taxes were unconstitutional because of his reading of Leviticus. They were careful, like people stepping around a hole in the floor they knew was there because they had made it together and covered it with a rug. Jack asked if the school board had stopped making pronouncements on social media and tightened the lid on his temper so that it only steamed and didn\u2019t lift. Mason made three small, accurate predictions about a reporter\u2019s angles that would save them both two hours later. The stew arrived. The sandwich came with fries that tasted of something like paprika and heat, and he was grateful for them like a man is grateful for a blanket on a church pew during a winter funeral.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not one thing,\u201d Mason said finally, when the food had made the first pass through their systems and the waitress had left without judgment. He had been watching his hands as if he needed a teleprompter in his palm. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem. The headline wants it to be one thing, but the copy is crowded. It\u2019s like a school bus at three-thirty. Everyone\u2019s sticky and yelling and carrying a trumpet.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to let me on the bus anyway,\u201d Jack said. He kept his voice even, patient in the way he reserved for other people\u2019s fear because he had learned to be decent in that specific way, and because he had gotten good at it from practice. \u201cGive me the headline you don\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nMason opened his mouth to answer, and then his phone lit up and the light from it cut his face into halves. He swore softly, and even his swears had a weather system. \u201cIt\u2019s Ms. Pettigrew,\u201d he said. \u201cI told her to call if they were delayed again. I didn\u2019t think she meant today.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnswer it,\u201d Jack said. He could feel his own body shift into the muscle memory of moving toward a problem, even when moving meant sitting still to listen. The stew breathed steam into the air like a horse in winter, and he watched Mason\u2019s eyes change shape as he listened, flattening into a focus he loved because it was almost the same as tenderness.\n\n\u201cShe says the crosstown bus is hung up at Lombardy because of the plows, and a driver let them out to walk to the transfer and her grandson fell and cracked his chin,\u201d Mason said, phone pressed to his ear with his shoulder, writing on the back of a receipt with the pen the waitress had left. \u201cNo one is hurt-hurt, but she\u2019s mad enough to file a lawsuit against the entire system and the sky.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll call Operations,\u201d Jack said, already reaching for his own phone. \u201cWe\u2019ll get someone to meet her at the stop with a kit, and we\u2019ll ask the route manager to explain why they decided to ignore the contingency plan they told me they had in writing.\u201d\n\nThey divided and did it, the way they always divided and did it, a small choreography performed with their napkins in their laps. Jack threaded his voice down the line into the place where decisions were made and asked that the people who were always a little sidelined be made central for an hour. He didn\u2019t shout. He didn\u2019t accuse. He said, \u201cHelp me,\u201d and the dispatcher on the other end, who had a cousin who had once danced with Jack\u2019s sister at a wedding, said, \u201cI will.\u201d Mason spoke to Ms. Pettigrew until she was laughing in her own grudging way, which was to say she agreed to be angry again later when it would be more useful. He arranged for a school nurse to meet them at the transfer point with a butterfly bandage that would have to stand in for a better world.\n\nWhen he hung up, Mason set the pen down carefully so it wouldn\u2019t roll. He looked at Jack with his mouth a little open, like someone who had walked up a long hill and was trying to look fine. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him you were the delegate,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou said your name like it was just your name.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes it works better,\u201d Jack said, and tried to make his grin a modest thing instead of the pride that wanted to leap up and flash its teeth. \u201cSometimes people just need a person and not a title.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Mason said, and rubbed the bridge of his nose like he was smoothing a crease in a bedsheet. \u201cOkay. Where were we. Crammed copy. Headline I hate.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive it to me,\u201d Jack said again, and then the door opened and a gust of cold came with a man who had been a mentor to Jack\u2019s mentor and liked to tell stories about the days when politeness governed men like a religion. The man\u2019s hair had been a work of engineering when Jack was a kid. Now it was a bright, marvelous white that made him look like a dandelion that meant to grant your wish whether you deserved it or not. He saw Jack, made himself surprised in a way that was both theater and kindness, and came over with his hand extended.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you two look industrious,\u201d he said, performing magnanimity because he had discovered years ago it fit him as well as anything else. \u201cCrowder, my boy, I keep hearing your name in sentences that sound like congratulations and worry. That means you\u2019re doing something.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to do the boring thing and call it a win,\u201d Jack said, which made the old man bark a laugh and clap him on the shoulder like he had been waiting to be given back that joke since his own first term.\n\n\u201cKeep at it,\u201d he said, his gaze flicking to Mason and softening with the kind of appreciation he reserved for people who did not need to be told they were essential but deserved to hear it all the same. \u201cYou taking care of him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI try,\u201d Mason said, the smile he wore the size of a playing card. \u201cIt\u2019s a two-man job.\u201d\n\nAfter the old man left, eels of other obligations swam up around them. Texts strung beads between their phones. A staffer appeared at the window and made eyebrows at Jack until he looked. The waitress dropped the check and said, \u201cDon\u2019t tip me with pennies, sugar,\u201d and smiled in a way that made him wonder whether telling the truth in small things had trained him for the bigger trying truths he still refused to set loose. They paid. They gathered their coats. At the door, Mason put his hand on Jack\u2019s elbow to steer him around a boy whose boots looked like they were older than he was, and Jack felt that touch like news.\n\nOn the walk back, the streets were that winter gray that could be either elegant or a threat depending on whether the wind decided to harass you. The snow had thinned into sugar on the grass. Traffic hissed wetly, the sound of cars discovering they weren\u2019t invincible. By the statue of the woman with the book on her lap, a man in a suit talked into his earbud and apologized to someone he loved for something he\u2019d meant to do and hadn\u2019t. Jack breathed in the cold and out the steam and counted five streetlights in a row that needed replacing. Mason walked with his hands in his coat pockets the way he did when he was trying not to smoke, which he didn\u2019t do anymore except in his head.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let me run from this,\u201d Mason said in a voice that pretended they were in the middle of a conversation and not at the edge of a cliff. \u201cI\u2019ve been training for avoidance my whole life. I can make a detour look like a destination.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can wait,\u201d Jack said, and discovered he meant it with a patience that might have looked like nobility if you didn\u2019t also see the cowardice stitched into its lining. \u201cIf you need the right place to say it.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight place,\u201d Mason repeated, as if the words were a map he was suspicious of. He laughed very quietly. \u201cOkay. Not in front of a statue and a man having a public apology, then.\u201d\n\nThe afternoon folded them up, as afternoons did. There were decisions to be nudged and a meeting that produced a sentence they would use thirty-seven times in the next month until it felt like chewing cardboard and something inside it still, obstinately, nourished. He called his mother from the stairwell and she told him to stop wearing suits like a funeral director\u2019s. He nodded and promised and didn\u2019t change anything. Mason left for forty minutes and came back with cheeks made red by weather and a pie in a box that perfumed the entire office. He set it on the file cabinet like a shrine. They fed sugar to three people who had come close to making public mistakes. They kept the mistakes private and exacted the quiet debt those rescues always cost, payable in support when a bill came down the line that needed a skeleton.\n\nClose to dusk, which was early and fierce the way it is when winter has been pretending all day that she\u2019s not serious and then remembers she is, they stood shoulder to shoulder at the window again. The dog who had galloped earlier had either learned obedience or had been leashed by someone with a stern voice and warm pockets. The dog pranced anyway, the leash an accessory, not a sentence. Mason\u2019s shoulder pressed for a second and then did not move away. Jack could feel the heat of him through both their coats as a definite fact.\n\n\u201cI need a better verb,\u201d Mason said, and the word was like a sign swung out into the path that said, Now. \u201cI\u2019ve been using admire. I\u2019ve been using care like seventy times a day, the way you say a word so often it turns into a sound that lives under your tongue and stops meaning itself. I could be cheap and say adore, but I\u2019m not that much of a liar. I could say want, but I\u2019m not only talking about hands.\u201d\n\nJack stood very still. He had learned so recently the usefulness of standing very still that it was beginning to feel like one more muscle he could flex when he needed it, and that frightened him because he could feel how that same muscle might calcify if he let it. \u201cYou could say love,\u201d he said, low, almost amused, like a man coaxing a cat out from under a bed with a trail of treats. \u201cYou could say the thing you already said and stop pretending you didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said it like a joke to keep the ceiling up,\u201d Mason said, and when he turned, his mouth was set as if he were about to make an argument before a hostile crowd and he didn\u2019t mind. \u201cI don\u2019t want the ceiling anymore, Jack. I want the weather. I want the roof off and the rain if we have to get the rain. I love you. Not as a disruptor of sentences, not as a strategy that\u2019s gotten out of hand, not as a trick to keep us tethered to the best parts of ourselves. I love you in the way that\u2019s a fact I wake up to like a sore tooth that I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m done with ignoring.\u201d\n\nThere was a length of silence after that sentence that could have been measured in phone vibrations or heartbeats or the distance between one streetlight and the next, which earlier he\u2019d counted without thinking. He hadn\u2019t been counting the space for this. He looked at him. He looked at his friend who had put his whole weight of careful onto Jack\u2019s life for years. He lifted the marble coin in his pocket with his thumb and the edges bit him, a kindness that kept him in his body. He imagined the headline anyway, because both of them would always be people who cared about how the story looked when you set it in bold: Local Man Loses Every Good Thing by Wanting One That Is Not Allowed. He took a breath that tasted like dust and clementine and something close to the first time he\u2019d seen the Capitol out of fog.\n\nHe didn\u2019t say the thing he wanted to say, because the thing he wanted to say would end them and begin them and he couldn\u2019t do both that and make sure the woman with a baby at the bus stop was warm. He set his hands flat on the window sill, a posture like prayer that he refused to name as such out of habit and superstition. \u201cI know,\u201d he said, and his voice broke at the top in a place he didn\u2019t know it had to break to be honest. \u201cI know. I think\u2014I think I have been pretending not to know so it wouldn\u2019t ask anything of me. That is a bad reason and I am sorry for it.\u201d\n\nMason huffed, which in him was the laugh he did when he did not want to be cruel to himself any longer than necessary. He was not looking at Jack now; he was looking at the dog, who had chosen to lie down in the snow and eat some of it with solemn purpose. \u201cNothing in you is a bad reason,\u201d he said. \u201cYour reasons might be inconvenient and shaped like institutions and dressed in scratchy collars, but you don\u2019t get to call them bad because you hate them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate them,\u201d Jack said, and realized he was trying to be fair to his fear. Then, because fairness was a trap and also a virtue he loved like a hymn, he amended, \u201cI hate what they do to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the rest of the headline,\u201d Mason said, as if he had been saving it behind his teeth to bring out if the air survived the first sentence. \u201cI got asked to take a job in D.C. If I want it. A real one with a salary that doesn\u2019t keep breaking its ankle, a team, a title that would mean my mother would stop telling people she raised a night owl with no prospects. They want me to start in six weeks. It would make me the kind of person people call when they want to get places I always told myself I didn\u2019t want. I didn\u2019t say yes yet. Because of you. Because of everything. Because I am so tired of wanting a thing and walking away from it like it belongs to someone else.\u201d\n\nJack had the unkind thought that love and the job offer were a tandem he should have anticipated. He had the kind thought that maybe this was a test in the good sense of tests, a way to see what they were made of, whether the labels they had stuck on themselves would hold if they got wet. He had a hundred petty thoughts and one large generous one, and the trick now was choosing which to let out into the room. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said, and meant it so hard his voice got soft to make room. \u201cOf course they want you. Of course they do. Anyone not trying to get you in their corner is a fool.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you in a room full of fools,\u201d Mason said, and now he did look at him, finally, as if he were letting himself look without guarding the door of that looking. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you where you have to pretend you aren\u2019t a man who would give away the bagels and your shirt and whatever else you shouldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to wake up in a city where the river is efficient instead of itself and not know whether you ate anything green that wasn\u2019t a hope.\u201d\n\nThere are ways to be brave that don\u2019t look like declarations. There are ways to be cowards that look like kindness. Jack tried to put his hands in the right place between those. He reached for the truth that would hurt the least and do the least damage and still be a truth. \u201cIf you want it, you should take it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should take the job. You\u2019ve carried me so far and so well. You should get to carry something else that loves you back without hiding behind a window. I am selfish as a man and as an elected official when I say, also, that I don\u2019t know how to stand in these rooms without the way you tilt your head when I\u2019m about to make a bad sentence.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll learn,\u201d Mason said, and his smile was not the one with both dimples or the fake one he made for the unendurable. It was the small one that showed one tooth and which always made Jack want to leave the room so no one else would see what it did to him. \u201cOr you won\u2019t. And I\u2019ll say no. Or I\u2019ll say yes and we\u2019ll write down every way we can keep this from pulling us apart like a cheap seam. Or I\u2019ll say nothing and let the window do the talking. We have six weeks of winter to pretend we don\u2019t need to decide any of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to decide it now,\u201d Jack said, and hated himself instantly for the relief that washed through him like heat when you come in from the cold. \u201cLunch first. Then ruin something. That was the promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe already ruined it a little,\u201d Mason said, which was true and released something in both of them like a wire springing loose. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Some things don\u2019t work until you take them apart.\u201d\n\nThe light went gold for a second, slutty and generous as if it had forgiven them in advance. The hearing at two o\u2019clock loomed, and then a meeting in a basement where the chairs made everyone tilt forward like supplicants. They turned from the window toward the slow machine of the day again. Jack cleared his throat and found the next small thing to carry. There was a stray boy in the vestibule when they came out of the office, the kind of teenager who looked like all their clothes had cost too much and nothing at all, his hands jammed deep in his hoodie, his mouth stubborn because he was living with someone else\u2019s ruin. \u201cAre you the guy,\u201d the boy said to Jack, not a question anyone had asked in exactly that way before. \u201cThe guy who keeps making my grandmother cry on TV?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope not,\u201d Jack said gently. \u201cDo you mean a good cry or a bad cry?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe says you say things like a preacher but don\u2019t make her want to hit you,\u201d the boy said, and hid his grin behind the collar of his sweatshirt like a man practicing for later. \u201cShe says you are the only one who got the trash guys to come down our street when the cans got froze-shut like they were people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about the cans,\u201d Jack said, because apology was a tool that did work if you didn\u2019t spend it too cheaply. \u201cTell your grandmother I said\u2014I said I will try to say the things I mean when I say them. And tell her if she needs me, I live at Ninth and grace, which comes in two meanings, both of which I\u2019m trying for.\u201d\n\nThe boy nodded, a solemnity older than he should have had flickering across his face like a trick of light. \u201cShe says you smell like oranges,\u201d he said, which made Mason laugh behind him and made the boy pleased, because he had made a grownup laugh without hurting him. Then he left, as if he had been conjured, as if he had only existed to deliver a line that put a pin in their map.\n\nAt two, they went to the basement with the slanted tables where men who had money made a point of sitting in folding chairs anyway to prove they were still of the people. The air was warmer than it ought to be because someone had tried to compensate for the snow by turning the heat to a number that meant sweat would become their civic contribution. Jack spoke and made himself slow enough to find the place where a sentence holds without having to be braced by a hand at its back, and he watched the nods move around the room like a current, hitting the corners where they needed to. He thought of verbs and chose expand without apology. He thought of his hands on the window sill and let them rest at the sides of the podium, as if to say he knew how to let something stand on its own legs.\n\nWhen it was over, he stood in the doorway and took a deep breath because he was alive, and because that had stopped being something he took for granted when he started letting the job draw lines on his ribs. Mason was across the room in the space where people discovered they were the kind of person who could confide in a stranger if the stranger had eyes like his. He looked up and found Jack and made the smallest shrug in the world, which meant something like, We\u2019re not done and also, That went fine and also, I\u2019m walking toward you now because there isn\u2019t any other direction to go.\n\nAt the end of the day there was the river again because the river is what you go to if you live here long enough that you don\u2019t even call it by its name more than once a month. They did not decide to go so much as find themselves there the way you find yourself on a porch you didn\u2019t realize you wanted to sit on. The light was thin, picked over. A boy with a stick was persuading a pile of snow to be a fort and then a spaceship and then a mountain for an ant to climb. In the trees a hawk had done something violent and was busy being beautiful about it. They walked until the bridge sounded like the wind was combing it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to take it,\u201d Jack said into his scarf without making it sound like he was giving an order, which he was not and could not be with him. \u201cI can hear it in your voice when you say the word team. You want it and you think wanting it is an indictment. It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s the part of you I fell in\u2014\u201d He stopped and did not let the word end itself. He reached for his coin, his old dare to himself. He swallowed the rest because he could not change time with a mouth.\n\n\u201cI want to want it without leaving the part where I stand in a hallway and bump your arm and watch a dog lie down in snow like he\u2019s been practicing contentment his whole life,\u201d Mason said. \u201cI want both, which is why I am either a greedy bastard or a man who is finally admitting he\u2019s tired of letting the city make his decisions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could be people who get both things,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe could be. I know how that sounds. I can hear myself. But I also know that when I was ten and the Capitol looked like a magic trick and then I learned how to see the trapdoor and still clap, I thought, maybe the trick is agreeing not to ruin the magic for yourself.\u201d He squinted at the water where it ran quick as sentences through the rock teeth. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make us small because the world is easier to carry when you\u2019re on your knees.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not good on my knees,\u201d Mason said with that crooked grin that hurt and carried medicine. \u201cI\u2019m too tall. I\u2019m good at holding. I\u2019m good at saying the word no for the right reasons and the word yes when it saves someone from drowning. I\u2019m good at your tie. I\u2019m good at the tiny bag of almonds in my pocket when you start to go shake-faint. I am so tired of being good at all of those and bad at telling you I want you enough to put my name on it and deal with the bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod,\u201d Jack said, and the word was not a prayer, but it was not not one. \u201cMe too.\u201d\n\nThe wind found the strip of skin between glove and coat cuff and made it argued with. He flexed his fingers because he didn\u2019t want to lose the sensation that they were his. Downriver, a train crossed, slow as a sermon, and the sound stitched the river to the sky and back to their boots. He wanted to kiss him with a ferocity that had almost no romance in it, only a desire to be done with not knowing. He wanted to put his mouth on his to make any kind of certainty. He thought of the yoga rumor, his mother\u2019s call, the pie that had saved them, the boy in the vestibule. He thought of their names in someone else\u2019s mouth.\n\n\u201cWhat if we don\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d Mason said suddenly, as if he had just been presented with a blackboard and a stub of chalk and a math problem that delighted him. \u201cWhat if we do it like every righteous woman in this city does it. What if we build a room that belongs to us and we lock the door and we don\u2019t apologize for the sound that leaks under it. What if we get to be complicated without letting anyone put their labels on our complication.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a secret I want to keep,\u201d Jack said, and the sentence came out clear and awful. He added, because mercy is a habit, \u201cBut. I understand the room. I understand the lock. I understand that there are some truths you put in your pocket because you can\u2019t walk otherwise. This\u2014\u201d He almost laughed because he had spent days and years refusing to name it as a this. \u201cThis can be a coin I carry. For a while. If you want to see what happens next and he doesn\u2019t end up hating us for doing it wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is the hawk,\u201d Mason said, tilting his head toward the tree where the bird kept being perfect and terrible. \u201cHe is the he with sharp feet and old eyes, and he already knows we are stupid and delicious. He will judge us no matter what we do.\u201d\n\nJack snorted, and the sound broke some concentration the wind had had on being cruel. He reached without permission and put his hand on the sleeve of Mason\u2019s coat. He left it there long enough that it became a fact. He felt the flit of muscles under the wool, small and fierce like birds startled and not flying away. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll write new rules. You\u2019ll take the job, if you want it, and we\u2019ll write new rules. We\u2019ll try to do it without making the kind of mistake we can\u2019t take back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will make mistakes that we can take back,\u201d Mason said, almost cheerful, which was his kind of optimism. \u201cWe\u2019ll make the kind that mean you have to say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I forgot the tissues,\u2019 and I\u2019ll say, \u2018I got you,\u2019 and we\u2019ll fix the draft before it goes to print.\u201d\n\n\u201cPromise me we don\u2019t turn into people who only talk in metaphors about work because it\u2019s easier than saying what we need,\u201d Jack said. \u201cPromise me proof. Even if it\u2019s a stupid proof. Even if it\u2019s just that you let me buy you a new tie like an old man who doesn\u2019t know how to say he wants to touch your neck.\u201d\n\n\u201cI accept the stupid proof,\u201d Mason said. \u201cI will wear the tie to a place where no one else is looking. I will take it off in a way that does not damage the fabric. I will bring a clementine to make sure it doesn\u2019t feel too serious.\u201d He looked out at the water the way a man looks at a thing he has loved longer than he admits. \u201cDo you ever get tired of being the person people think you are supposed to be?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d Jack said. \u201cAnd then someone asks me if I can make the bus stop closer to their house, and I remember I want to be the person who can try.\u201d\n\nThey stood there until the cold did what it always does and insisted. They walked back with their shoulders again doing that near, not touching dance that had a book\u2019s worth of grammar and none of the rules written down. They stopped at the grocery not because either of them needed anything but because the fluorescent lights and absurdist abundance of a suburban-style market inside the city made you feel you were in a place where choices could be made without consequence. They bought milk as if they were the kind of people who regularly drank milk. They bought batteries because winter reminded you of power lines. Mason put two clementines in the basket like a joke to themselves they were suddenly allowed to have.\n\nBack at the office, there was a message from a donor who had been patient and now wasn\u2019t. There was a letter from a little girl with gel pen hearts along the margin asking why people with wheelchairs had to take the long way around. There was an email from Channel 12 asking if he would come on to talk about potholes. He answered the letter first, carefully, because gel pen hearts rearrange a day whether or not they should. He wrote, I am sorry about the steps and the detours and also I am sorry about the ways I have become a person who accepts them because it\u2019s easier in the moment than saying the word ramp out loud in rooms with tight budgets. He wrote, I will try. He did not send it until Mason read it and nodded once like a judge who had decided to deliver mercy for good behavior.\n\nWhen the building cleared, when the last lobbyist had packed up their charts and left their coffee cup to sweat a ring onto a wood surface that had been polished with a paternal fervor by men in coveralls, when the lights hummed and then were kind, Mason shut the door with his hip and leaned the back of his head against the cool of it. He watched Jack with an attention that still, after all these years, made Jack want to straighten his tie and then take it off. He said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to mess this up. And we\u2019re going to be very good at it. Both. At once.\u201d\n\nJack sat back in the chair that always felt a little too big in triumph and a little too small when he was scared. He put the coin on the desk without hiding it. He said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been very good at so many wrong things. This would be a nice change.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome here,\u201d Mason said softly, the words shaped like an order and a plea, both gentle. Jack did, crossing the space in three steps that could have been a mile or a second, he couldn\u2019t tell. Mason didn\u2019t kiss him because if he did they might not stop, and stopping mattered more than giving in for now. He put his forehead against Jack\u2019s forehead and the pressure was the kind you get when someone presses a stone into your palm and says, This is yours for luck. He breathed in, and Jack breathed in, and it was as if they were taking turns being the person who remembered how.\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Mason said, voice steady now that there was meaning lodged behind it. \u201cWe\u2019ll be brilliant and hilarious and full of talking points. We will move the needle, perhaps even the whole sewing machine. And then we can be exactly this again for a minute before we run back into the building we built that keeps trying to catch fire and write its name in smoke.\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Jack agreed, and felt something inside him agree that had been refusing to pick a side. He laughed a little and could not help it. \u201cAlso the serious coat is doing a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour destiny,\u201d Mason said gravely, but his mouth betrayed him and grinned. \u201cYour nose is so red we could hang ornaments on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you ever hang an ornament on my face, I\u2019m calling the ethics commission,\u201d Jack said. He stepped back reluctantly and it was not just reluctant; it was a decision they had made together without a word. \u201cI have to call my mother. She will know anyway if I try to avoid it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell her the yoga instructor is a lie,\u201d Mason said. \u201cTell her the delicious scandal she will hear in the produce section has been replaced by the more nutritious fact of you eating soup like a person who understands winter.\u201d\n\nJack nodded and lifted his phone like a man lifting a heavy baby. He dialed. He said hello and listened to her relief deploy itself in a gentle scold that made him remember the wrong tie at his high school graduation and the right tie at his father\u2019s funeral. He told her about potholes and pie. He did not tell her about the river. He did not tell her about the coin or the room with a lock. He told her, unprompted, that he was eating, which was the closest he could come without the ceiling giving up entirely. When he hung up, the office did that settling thing that old buildings do when you remind them you are leaving them to do what they like best, which is hold.\n\nOn his walk home, the night had decided to be serious after all. The cold had the clean sound of something finished being polite. He stopped at the mural of the woman who laughed and put his palm against the painted sun because it made him feel like he was making good on an old bargain. He turned the corner where the drunk moth of his earlier thought had finally landed and was now resting. He reached his building and climbed the stairs and let his apartment remember him. He stood in the kitchen with its habit of being kind at exactly the wrong moments and took the coin out of his pocket again and placed it on the table like a period.\n\nHis phone buzzed once: a photo from Mason of a clementine peeled into one long coil like a ribbon left on a chair at a party, the caption a single word that was a verb and both a command and a description: Stay. He wrote back nothing because sometimes the answer to a verb is to obey it in your body and not waste language making it pretty. He washed his face. He folded the serious coat over the back of a chair as if it were a person he was asking to stay as well. He slept with the coin in reach, which was childish, and he woke halfway to morning from a dream where the Capitol lifted like a ship out of fog and he had to decide whether to wave or run to the dock. He didn\u2019t pick. He stood there in the dream and did not miss the boat, and when his alarm tapped his shoulder later he understood in the unexpected clean space of dawn that sometimes not missing the boat looks like waiting.\n\nSnow fell again, a stingy lace. He made coffee that tasted less like pennies because he\u2019d cleaned the machine. He opened the refrigerator and discovered there was nothing in it he wanted and then reminded himself that wanting was different now. He sent a text to Mason that said, Bring the almonds, and another that said, I\u2019m wearing the tie you hate, which already meant the opposite. He put the coin in his pocket. He went out into his city, which kept choosing them back even when they disappointed it, which kept offering up its dogs and its boys with grudges and its women in hats and its bridges like outstretched hands. He headed for the building with columns that had learned how to stand through so many loud seasons, and he told himself again the lie he needed not to cry on the bus: Maybe today will be the day the hallway turns into a room with more than one door. He walked into the day. He carried every verb he had. He did not forget the noun.",

Jack took his place at the table with a legal pad he didn\u2019t intend to write on and a cup of coffee he would forget to drink. The city\u2019s winter light came through the blinds as if unsure it had the right to be there. He had slept with the coin under his pillow and the sleep had been full of trains, which made sense only if you didn\u2019t try to make sense of it. When Mason came in he looked like the same person who had leaned his forehead against Jack\u2019s last night and also like a stranger who had borrowed that person\u2019s coat. He slid into the chair beside him with the whisper of wool and paper and gave him a look that said, We are going to pull this off because the alternative is letting the day run errands for us and we don\u2019t allow that.\n\nThe first speaker was a man who had come to bless and scold in equal measures. He wore a tie that had once been festive and was now just tired. He called Jack by his full name and then shortened it without permission, as if intimacy could speed the passage of his grievance through the pipeline. Jack listened the way he had taught himself to listen, which was with his head slightly cocked and his mouth in a position that communicated both humility and willingness to say the word no. He thought, as the man read from a paper he had folded into a geometry the night before, about the word they had chosen together. Expand. It sat between his teeth like a seed. It would need watering. It would need sun. He would have to keep people from stepping on it just to feel the satisfaction of crushing something that wasn\u2019t theirs.\n\nBetween speakers he leaned in and said, very low, \u201cYou didn\u2019t text me when you got home.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t trust my sentences,\u201d Mason said without looking at him, his pen poised above the yellow pad like he was sketching a map no one else could see. \u201cI thought I might build a bridge to a place we weren\u2019t ready to stand. I sent you citrus instead. It seemed less dangerous and more honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI put the peel on my windowsill,\u201d Jack said, and then a woman approached with a folder, and he folded the confession into his pocket and smiled with the part of his face that could smile without betraying the rest.\n\nAfter the hearing, a reporter ambushed them in the hallway that smelled like a cross between soap and old anger. She had red ears from the cold and a voice she used when she wanted to sound like your aunt and your interrogator. \u201cDelegate Crowder,\u201d she said, holding her mic like it was a truce flag she might snap in half. \u201cThere\u2019s buzz that donor pressure is shaping your transit bill. Have you changed the language in response to contributions?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll language is a response to something,\u201d Jack said, buying himself two seconds with a truism he could almost defend. He felt Mason to his left and slightly behind, a position that meant I am watching the angles and also I will pull you out by your collar if you walk where there\u2019s no floor. \u201cWe\u2019ve updated the bill because riders showed us where we could do better. If someone wrote a check and also rides the bus, I\u2019m happy that those two good habits can coexist.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if someone wrote a check and doesn\u2019t ride the bus?\u201d she said, her eyebrow lifting like the arm of a crane.\n\n\u201cThen I hope they\u2019ll consider trying one,\u201d Jack said, and he used the bright version of the smile because sometimes humor disarmed people who wanted to sharpen you into a cautionary tale. Mason stepped in so gently no one could call it interference and said, \u201cWe\u2019re expanding access. That\u2019s the headline. Expanding. You can call us at four if you want specifics on cost recovery. We love to make numbers sing.\u201d\n\nBy the time they got back upstairs the office smelled not like clementines but like the plastic clamshell of pie Mason had set on the file cabinet the day before. He had tucked a fork under the lip of the lid as if he knew future versions of them would need it. On Jack\u2019s chair there was an envelope with the donor letterhead he recognized. It had the weight of expectation and a font that assumed it would be obeyed. He put it in the drawer without opening it and felt almost brave. He would open it later and consider the bargain it tried to write for him and then, if he was lucky, he would write another sentence on top of it that did not scream but also did not kneel.\n\n\u201cWyatt wants you for three minutes alive at five,\u201d Mason said, perched on the edge of the desk with the ease of a man who had only recently learned how to take up the space his body required. \u201cIf you go, he won\u2019t ask about the yoga instructor. If you don\u2019t go, he will, and he\u2019ll bring a mat.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we have to pay for the mat?\u201d Jack said, and it felt good to let the joke come like muscle memory. \u201cI have a serious coat and a serious tie. I can do serious at five.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can do serious at any hour,\u201d Mason said, but his eyes did a small, private thing, like a shutter opening and closing. \u201cMs. Pettigrew\u2019s grandson got glued. Not literally. They got him to the nurse, she glued the chin, no stitches. There\u2019s a rumor he showed his scar off to his math class and got someone\u2019s phone number out of it. The righteous sometimes prosper.\u201d\n\n\u201cSend them flowers,\u201d Jack said, and then thought about high school boys and felt the complication bloom in his chest. \u201cNo, not flowers. That\u2019ll embarrass him. Send her a card. And\u2014I don\u2019t know. Soup?\u201d\n\n\u201cSoup is safe and declarative,\u201d Mason said, writing it down. \u201cSoup says we see you and we will not make you do dishes.\u201d\n\nThe afternoon was a parade of useful tedium. The zoning subcommittee turned its chair into a throne for an hour and then climbed down and apologized for the height. A woman with a planner full of neon flags wanted to know if they could make dogs legal on the bus on Sundays because that was the day their owner\u2019s depression was worst and walking in the cold felt like a punishment. Jack said he would ask, and he would ask, and maybe he would make a rule that dogs on Sundays were allowed if they were carried, which would be both adorable and likely to cause an allergic incident that would land on Channel 12 with a thud. He learned the route of yet another elevator that claimed to be out of service but would grudgingly carry you if you held the door and spoke kindly to it. He ate half a granola bar and discovered it was the kind meant to imitate dessert badly.\n\nAt three, his mother texted him a picture of a floral arrangement at her church with the caption, Ugly as sin, which made him milk-laugh and promise God in his head he would not hold the blasphemy against her. He sent back a photograph Mason had taken that morning of the dog in the snow with the caption, Joyful sinner and let the exchange be instead of a phone call. He thought briefly, painfully, about what it would mean to say the word boyfriend out loud to his mother in a kitchen with laminate like old teeth. He imagined her face, how it would go through its stages like thunderheads, and then he put the thought down because it wasn\u2019t fair to make her do the work in his head and then fault her imagined performance.\n\nAt four-thirty, the donor called. It wasn\u2019t someone with a checkbook; it was the assistant with a schedule and a script. She had the voice of a girl who had placed fifth in debate and never recovered from the shock. \u201cDelegate Crowder,\u201d she said, \u201cMr. Halloran wanted to follow up on his letter regarding the TIF expansion. He\u2019s concerned about the rhetorical direction of your office.\u201d\n\nJack put the call on speaker because it made it less intimate to be told he was disappointing someone with money. He watched Mason as the voice went on about job creators and the business climate and the way a phrase like expand could sound like promise to the wrong ears. Mason did what he did best. He did not blink much. He did not roll his eyes. He wrote in the corner of the yellow pad, writes checks but not bus poetry, which made Jack have to cough to disguise the laugh.\n\n\u201cMr. Halloran\u2019s concern is duly noted,\u201d Jack said, when the assistant paused, either to breathe or to reload. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to working with the business community to produce predictable outcomes. We\u2019re also committed to making sure that a mother with two jobs doesn\u2019t have to take three buses to get to a shift that pays less than your intern\u2019s rent.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d love to help you find a middle ground,\u201d she said, as if the ground had to be strained through her approval to be middle enough. \u201cCould you send us your draft language by the end of the day?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can send you a summary,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe\u2019ll release the text when we release the text. I think that\u2019s fair.\u201d\n\n\u201cFairness can be subjective,\u201d she said, probably because she had been told it was a good line that made legislators sweat. \u201cWe want to remain supportive.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe too,\u201d Jack said, and he let his voice get warm like a sun that doesn\u2019t owe anyone anything.\n\nWhen he hung up, Mason blew out his cheeks in a performance of annoyance that didn\u2019t even begin to cover his affection for the ridiculousness of people who thought access meant ownership. \u201cIf Mr. Halloran would like to ride the crosstown at six a.m., I will buy him a pastry so he doesn\u2019t die on his way to empathy,\u201d he said. \u201cI will personally pick him up from his freshly paved driveway and hold his mitten while he waits.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will lose all your points with heaven,\u201d Jack said, and he no longer had to tuck the affection back behind his teeth. \u201cHeaven hates sarcasm.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeaven runs press,\u201d Mason said. \u201cHeaven knows a good line when it hears one.\u201d\n\nAt ten to five, they walked over to the station through air that smelled like whatever came before snow in a city like this. The sidewalks were busy with people who were pretending they didn\u2019t have to watch their steps. Wyatt\u2019s producer corralled them with a smile sharp as a safety pin. Wyatt himself was wearing a tie that had not been ironed in this decade and the visible relief of a man who had wrestled his rundown into submission. He had the good kind of hunger, the kind that made him lean in without trying to bite. \u201cWe\u2019ll toss you a softball and then something with two seams,\u201d he said, recoiling slightly from Mason\u2019s scarf like a cat from a cucumber and then recovering with professional grace. \u201cAvoid yoga. Embrace potholes. We\u2019re all going to be heroes.\u201d\n\nIn the two minutes before they went live, Mason stood off-camera and ran his thumb along the seam of his coat the way he did when he wanted to smoke and wouldn\u2019t. He mouthed expand like an absurdist religious devotion, and Jack looked at the monitor because if he looked at Mason he would forget the number he had memorized. He answered the questions and didn\u2019t let his hands talk too much because the cameraman had once told him they unsettled viewers. He said the phrase predictable outcomes again and managed not to smirk. He remembered to thank the anchor by her name, which made her eyes soften for a split second, not for him but for the place where his name and hers lived briefly in the same air.\n\nAfter, in the hallway that was always three degrees colder than any other hallway in the city, Mason said, \u201cYou threaded it. You threaded a needle while someone was trying to shake your elbow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to say fuck,\u201d Jack said, and the swearing felt like a small rebellion that would never make the news.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll put it on a mug,\u201d Mason said, and then, more quietly, \u201cSix weeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cSix weeks,\u201d Jack repeated. He had thought the words would make him feel the drop he had learned to anticipate in elevators that didn\u2019t warn you they were going to stop between floors. Instead he felt the brief steadiness you get when you\u2019ve decided to keep walking even if the sidewalk turns out to be ice. \u201cWhen do you go to look?\u201d\n\n\u201cTuesday,\u201d Mason said. \u201cTwo days of meetings and the ritual of pretending we don\u2019t know what each other\u2019s jobs are. I\u2019ll be back in time for the school board if the train remembers itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t wear that green tie,\u201d Jack said, and he heard the way the sentence was both trivial and not. \u201cWear the one with the small squares. It makes people think you\u2019re not bored even when you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the worst bagel shop owner but you\u2019re excellent at ties,\u201d Mason said, and the grin he gave him was the one that had always done something to Jack\u2019s equilibrium that science should study. \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay without me for forty-eight hours. You will not be allowed to rearrange your desk to punish me while I\u2019m gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be busy not swearing on television,\u201d Jack said, and he felt, absurdly, like he wanted to take Mason\u2019s hand, not to kiss it or clutch it, just to demonstrate to the air the simple physics of it. He put his hands in his pockets instead and touched the coin with his thumb until it was a compass again.\n\nThey did not go to the river that night, which felt like an omission and also like restraint. They went instead to a neighborhood meeting in a room that had once been a kindergarten and still smelled faintly of paste and two-year-old sweats. A woman in a denim jacket stood up and talked about her mother\u2019s porch, how the developers had promised it wouldn\u2019t be shadowed by anything new and now you could put a hand on the siding at noon and feel you were pressing your palm against dusk. A man snorted when someone said equity, and then apologized, and then said equity again without the snort, which is its own kind of miracle. Mason passed Jack a note that said, Not allowed to fix everyone and then drew a jellyfish wearing a top hat. Jack felt laughter move through him and settle into a braid with his ache.\n\nOn the way out, under the weak shout of the streetlight, a kid with a skateboard pretending to be a sled nearly ran into Jack\u2019s knees and then apologized by swearing with a sincerity Jack envied. \u201cWatch your mouth,\u201d an aunt in a pink beret said without heat, and the boy did not. Mason wrapped his scarf higher and said, \u201cWe need to write a rule about us and community meetings.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the rule?\u201d Jack said, and it made him shy to say the word us even though it should have been the easiest word he had.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t sit next to each other,\u201d Mason said. \u201cWe don\u2019t look at each other when someone says synergy. We don\u2019t let our faces finish sentences we have decided not to speak.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll fail,\u201d Jack said, but he nodded, because some kinds of failure you plan for and then execute with grace, like falling on ice without shattering your coffee. \u201cWe\u2019ll fail and then we\u2019ll make a joke and call it training.\u201d\n\n\u201cTraining is for the river,\u201d Mason said, and then, shrugging into the coat, \u201cI lied. Training is for us.\u201d\n\nSunday came, though it had the indecisive weather of a weekday in disguise. Jack went to his mother\u2019s house because some obligations were love in work clothes. She opened the door with a dishtowel in her hand and a look on her face that said she had been waiting on the landing for fifteen minutes, listening for his step like a girl. The house smelled like onions and the salt of somebody else\u2019s happiness. On the counter, she had set out a plate of cookies that were the wrong shape and therefore perfect. She asked about potholes with more interest than anyone on television. She touched his cheek with two fingers and then pretended she hadn\u2019t.\n\nAt the table, she told a story about a woman from choir whose nephew had been invited to D.C. to work for someone who believed in good shoes and bad health insurance. She watched him watch her and he watched himself watching her and it was like the three of them were looking into a mirror that kept changing who it reflected. \u201cD.C. is for people who like to hear themselves buzz,\u201d she said, and then softened it, because she was always kinder than her first sentence. \u201cD.C. is for people who like trains.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome trains are good,\u201d Jack said carefully, and he took a cookie and didn\u2019t break it in half. \u201cSome trains take you exactly where you meant to go but you didn\u2019t know it until you got off.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always were a boy who took too long to go to bed,\u201d she said, which was not the sentence he\u2019d expected and therefore the right one. \u201cI can hear you at night in my head, walking circles. That\u2019s not a criticism. It\u2019s a fact I wake up with like a sore tooth.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t borrow my metaphors,\u201d he said, and his voice went thin and he let it. \u201cThey don\u2019t sit right on you.\u201d\n\nShe made a face, which on her meant affection disguised as disapproval. \u201cBring your friend around for supper,\u201d she said, as if that were a thing they did all the time and not a small astonishment. \u201cThe one with the scarf. He looks cold half the time. I\u2019ll make something that makes him stop looking that way.\u201d\n\nHe would have sworn the air in the kitchen tilted. He would have sworn the light did something generous without warning. He swallowed and discovered his mouth had gone dry with gratitude. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be away for a couple of days,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter, maybe. When the trains are done with him.\u201d\n\nShe nodded as if trains were a reasonable adversary and then pinched his ear like he was ten and said, \u201cWear a hat,\u201d which was her way of saying I know and I\u2019m trying.\n\nWhen Mason left on Tuesday, he left the office looking like itself on purpose. He set the pie fork in the drawer. He angled the stapler a degree to the left because he knew Jack would notice and pretend he hadn\u2019t. He put a clementine in the pocket of the serious coat like a benediction he didn\u2019t have the vanity to speak. At the station, he texted a photograph of the departures board and wrote, God is a schedule and then another of his own shoes with the caption, These are the ones that don\u2019t make me look like a man who makes speeches and Jack wanted more than anything to be sitting beside him, knees touching briefly at the turn of a curve. He wrote back, Don\u2019t fall in love with a policy analyst in a gray suit, and Mason wrote, Too late.\n\nThe office felt loud in the wrong ways without him. The copier took it as a personal challenge to jam when no one else was around to listen to its song of grief. People came in and said their sentences and left and he found himself looking at the doorway as if the building might spit up the person he wanted like a blessing. He wrote an op-ed about sidewalks with the tone of a man who knows people think sidewalks aren\u2019t exciting and is determined to seduce them anyway. He took two meetings alone and didn\u2019t say a joke where Mason would have said one and afterwards got an email from a man who had been present that said simply You were kind and true and is there a word for that in Greek, which made him put his head down for thirty seconds to let the compliment do what it needed to do without cracking him open.\n\nAt lunch he took his sandwich to the stairs because stairs have always been a good place for people who want to be dramatic without asking for witnesses. He ate slowly and did not text Mason because he didn\u2019t want to knit the day tight around the absence and call that comfort. He counted the number of blue coats going by and then made himself stop because counting could become a superstition if you let it. He thought of the room with the lock and of the hawk and of his mother\u2019s cookies, which had made a silt of sugar on the plate that looked like someone\u2019s home planet flecked with stars.\n\nAt three, the assistant from Mr. Halloran\u2019s office called again, which was a surprise he recognized as an omen. \u201cWe\u2019d love to offer you an amendment you can call your own,\u201d she said, like a woman opening a jewelry box to show you a trinket she would lend you for a night and then take back at the door. \u201cIt\u2019ll keep the developers from wandering off.\u201d\n\n\u201cDevelopers aren\u2019t toddlers,\u201d Jack said, and he made sure the tone had no spike in it. \u201cIf they need a nap, we\u2019ll talk to them about their schedules. We\u2019re not going to gut the funding mechanism so you can call it bipartisanship and I can call it nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mayor will be disappointed,\u201d she said cheerfully, which is another thing people say when they mean, Someone else will try to make you pay.\n\n\u201cThe mayor gets disappointed sometimes,\u201d Jack said, and he looked out the window at the dog running without a leash again, delighted by his mission to be exactly himself. \u201cHe gets over it.\u201d\n\nWhen Mason called from D.C. that night, the connection made them sound like they had cotton in their mouths. The city the phone built between them was a clumsy one but serviceable. \u201cEverything here is extra,\u201d Mason said, and Jack could hear traffic like a misplaced symphony. \u201cThe compliments wear sequins. The insults wear cologne. A man walked past me talking about bipartisan stakeholder synergy with tears in his eyes. It was almost moving. I almost believed him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your headline you hate?\u201d Jack said, and he stood at his window and watched a couple fight kindly on the sidewalk about their groceries. \u201cGive me the worst version so I can write the better one while you\u2019re asleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate the one that says I left you to be important,\u201d Mason said, quiet in the way he got when he was nearest to saying what he meant. \u201cI hate the one that says I traded the river for an efficient canal and called it love. I hate the one that says I didn\u2019t try to choose both, and I hate the one that says I did and everyone laughed at us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will be laughed at for worse,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe will be laughed at for the tie you hate and the serious coat and the word equity when we put it in a sentence without apology. We can live with that, if we have to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI found a bakery that made me think of your niece\u2019s whales,\u201d Mason said, because sometimes he could not allow himself the direct sentence. \u201cNot because of whales. Because of the tiny ridiculous frosting that only exists to make someone stop being mean to themselves for an hour. I bought a cookie. I did not eat it. I carried it around like a scandal and then I stopped on a bench and I ate it and no one arrested me for joy and I thought, I can do this for six weeks. I can learn the names of the subway stops and pretend they are ours.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring me a cookie if it travels,\u201d Jack said. \u201cBring me a rumor about yourself that is not about yoga.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlready in circulation,\u201d Mason said. \u201cSomeone said I was seen smiling sincerely at a lobbyist. Don\u2019t tell anyone. It will ruin me.\u201d\n\nHe slept badly without the knowledge of Mason\u2019s breath on a sofa across a room, which made him ashamed because he had always prided himself on being a person who slept like the dead and did not ask others for the favor of unbroken rest. In the morning, he woke with the conviction that this was manageable if he kept his day small enough to carry in one hand. He drank coffee that had not improved in his absence. He wrote three sentences for a speech about alley lights that sounded like hymns in his ear and then laughed at himself because he knew better than to be that man in public.\n\nHe was not prepared for the boy\u2019s grandmother in the lobby mid-morning, wrapped in green wool and righteous posture, scar-chin boy trailing behind her with the wounded pride of a person whose injury had made him briefly holy and then just a regular kid again. \u201cI brought you a pie,\u201d she said, and she set it down on the desk with the soft thud of a present that came with a condition. \u201cI brought you a pie because you called the man who knows the manager who knows the driver who knows the nurse. You didn\u2019t tell them who you were until they asked, and even then you said it like a person and not a program. I wanted to do a thing in a pan that would make that true longer.\u201d\n\nJack tried to say thank you in the way that matched. He failed, but he failed in the direction of sincerity. The boy rolled his eyes at him with affection like a gift he wasn\u2019t sure how to accept yet. \u201cHe says you smell like oranges,\u201d the boy said, as if this were a criticism, which it probably was and that was fine. \u201cHe says you say things like a preacher and then you say sorry when you should and not when you shouldn\u2019t. You want us to help you get you on the news? We know a guy with a drone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re okay for drones,\u201d Jack said, and he took the pie and didn\u2019t pretend he wasn\u2019t honored. \u201cBut if you want to tell your friends that we\u2019re going to try to make the bus not treat you like a secret, I wouldn\u2019t argue with that.\u201d\n\nAfter they left, he put the pie beside the old pie and marveled, briefly, at the abundance in this tiny economy of sweetness. He wrote to Mason, Two pies, which he knew would be read as more than two pies and Mason wrote back, Keep one in the lock room, which made him laugh aloud in the empty office and then look around as if the walls could be offended.\n\nThat afternoon, he stood under the mural of the aunt with the rolled hair and answered a call from the mayor, who was in a mood that could have been called \u201cpractical terrorism.\u201d The mayor wanted the word \u201cpredictable\u201d more times in the bill than there were buses in the city. He wanted \u201cexpedite\u201d and \u201csunset\u201d and \u201curban fabric\u201d like a magic trick that could make gentrification a rug they swept regret under. Jack said a set of sentences that felt like walking through a room with a low ceiling and avoided hitting his head on the light fixture only because he had been in that room before. When he hung up, he put his hand on the painted sun and it felt warm not because paint can do that, but because touch makes its own heat.\n\nBy the time Mason came back, the river had frozen briefly in the corners that didn\u2019t matter. He walked in with his scarf in the self-satisfied loop of a man who had charmed a train into being on time. He looked like the same person and like someone who had been looked at by strangers for two days and had to remake his face. He put his bag down on the chair visitors pretended was comfortable and he didn\u2019t say anything for four seconds because the silence between them had to remember how to be a bridge and not a moat.\n\n\u201cI brought you a cookie,\u201d he said, and he held up a small white box with a string like a storybook. \u201cIt has traveled. It has suffered. It is still itself.\u201d\n\nJack took it and the string came undone as if the box had been waiting to be relieved. The cookie inside was absurdly delicate for a thing made to be destroyed. It was piped with a border of sugar that thought it was lace. He broke it in half and handed the larger piece to Mason without theatrics and they ate, leaning against the desk like two boys in a kitchen who had never learned to stand up straight when the world had something good for them. The sweetness went chemical and then clean and then brief, as all sweetness does when you don\u2019t chase it with something rude.\n\n\u201cTell me the worst thing,\u201d Jack said once the sugar had settled, because he could not resist asking for the bruise.\n\n\u201cThe worst thing is how much I liked being important to strangers,\u201d Mason said, looking down at his own shoes like they might tell him a kinder story. \u201cThe worst thing is I thought, I can do this and I can do us, and then I walked past a man sleeping under a stone lion and I thought, I can\u2019t be in two cities and pretend that\u2019s not a decision and also pretend I\u2019m delicate about the right things. The worst thing,\u201d he added, and his mouth was the shape of a man who might bite himself to stop a sentence, \u201cis that for two hours today I didn\u2019t think about you at all and I thought, This is what the job would be like, and I was relieved and then I hated myself and then I forgave myself because I am learning not to be cruel to me when I am honestly trying.\u201d\n\nJack felt the coin bite his thumb. He set it on the desk because he was tired of hiding the way he stayed. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t punish ourselves for being good at more than one thing. We don\u2019t pretend we\u2019re saints when we\u2019re men with calendars. We write a rule that says we get to want the job and the river, and when we fail the rule we try again. We can try again until we\u2019re dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re terrible at bagels but excellent at rules,\u201d Mason said, and the grin came like the light across the river when the clouds move just enough to make you believe you could walk the water without sinking. \u201cI put a deposit on a place for six months. Not there. Here. My lease is up. I\u2019m going to keep a bed that\u2019s mine and a room that\u2019s ours. If I take it, I go, and then I come back. If I don\u2019t, I sleep there and you can find the key in the place I\u2019ll show you once and never text.\u201d\n\nJack felt his eyes get hot, which he hated. He nodded because nodding was safer than speaking. He breathed and thought about the hallway and the room with more than one door. He thought about the word stay and how sometimes the bravest thing it asked of you was to mean it. He reached forward, not across a desk, not in the river\u2019s permission, but here, in the ordinary light of their ordinary office, and he put his hand over Mason\u2019s hand and did not move it away. They stood like that, the day waiting politely for them to notice it again, the pie aging gracefully on the cabinet, the coin a small faithful circle between them. Outside the window, the dog lay down in the snow and ate it with the same solemnity as before, unwavering in his belief that nourishment could come from cold.\n\nThey were interrupted, of course, because that was how their lives were arranged\u2014grace with a doorbell. The intern stuck his head in without knocking and said, \u201cChannel 12 is here with a camera to ask you about sidewalks,\u201d and then winced because he had surprised himself with his own bluntness. Jack removed his hand and they both took a breath that sounded ridiculous on the quiet. Mason straightened his tie like something you do when you aren\u2019t sure what else to fix.\n\n\u201cSidewalks,\u201d Mason said, turning toward the door and rolling his shoulders back into the shape of the man who could make sentences carry their own weight. \u201cLet\u2019s go tell the city we want them to stop tripping on their own feet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll say expand ninety times,\u201d Jack said, and the joke steadied him like a palm on his back, firm and unembarrassed. \u201cWe\u2019ll say fair without letting it bite us.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd after,\u201d Mason said, his voice back to that bright rim that meant he was comfortable in the difficulty, \u201cwe\u2019ll go buy a tie I will hate so thoroughly I will love it.\u201d He lifted the clementine from the coat pocket where he had stowed it for luck and set it on the desk by the coin as if the two of them were a matched set. \u201cProof,\u201d he said, and the word did its work in the air, a hinge between their separate motions and the place they were building to come back to.",

The river loosened its shoulders where it had stiffened around rocks, the ice shrugging itself into harmless, bright shards. Jack woke before his alarm because light, at last, wanted to be counted on, and he lay there with the coin under his pillow, aware of its small, insistent circle the way you\u2019re aware of a promise you haven\u2019t yet paid. He dressed without the serious coat and let the whales at the ends of his scarf grin at the elevator door as it opened and shut, a tiny rebellion against the halls that preferred their men in unblemished tones. In the car he turned the radio low and didn\u2019t hear the headline because his brain was busy rehearsing the sentence he would say if someone tried to modify expand into a weaker flirtation. He passed a man jogging in a sweatshirt that declared his allegiance to a team that hadn\u2019t existed in three decades and thought, with a tenderness that surprised him, about all the ways people chose to belong.\n\nUpstairs, the office had that morning plainness he had learned to love because it meant nothing had been set on fire in his absence. Mason was there before him, which meant the train had remembered its duty and returned him with the particular smugness of public transit that behaves. He was humming under his breath, not a song exactly, but the sound he made when he was lining up the day\u2019s obstacles and assigning them numbers. He looked good in the way that made Jack want to sit down and pretend he had always been in the chair; travel had put a faint windburn into his cheeks, and his hair had discovered a part it didn\u2019t usually admit to. He said, as if they were mid-conversation, \u201cI missed the man with the dog. I kept expecting to see him on the sidewalk up there, going rogue around a marble fountain. He didn\u2019t show,\u201d and then he smiled because he understood he was saying, I missed you, and they were the kind of people who gave the truth a face it could bear.\n\nThey divided the morning the way you divide a piece of cake you want the other person to steal bites of. Mason set up the pre-brief for the noon presser about streetlight repair, and he did it with the care of a person who understands that saying the word luminaire incorrectly can make a room decide you don\u2019t deserve electricity. Jack called the route manager from Operations and made him explain, again and without sighing, how a change in snow protocol had stranded a bus on a hill it had no business trying to conquer. Ms. Pettigrew called to tell them the boy\u2019s scar had turned into bragging rights he was using judiciously. She delivered the update like a woman reading from the minutes of a meeting you hadn\u2019t been invited to and then concluded, \u201cI brought a slice of pie to the driver and I said, \u2018Don\u2019t do it again,\u2019 and he promised and also asked me for the recipe. That seems fair,\u201d to which Jack replied that fairness, when attached to pie, was the only version that never disappointed him.\n\nNear ten, Warren from downstairs brought up an envelope again that had the weight of either a threat or an apology. He put it on the desk with the gentleness of a man setting down an egg he wasn\u2019t sure was hard-boiled. The letterhead was the same as before; the assistant had typed their concern into a new shape as if rearranging the furniture could make a smaller apartment bigger. Jack left it unopened, letting the paper do the small work of appearing ominous while he spent himself elsewhere, and he said, to no one but the air, \u201cLater,\u201d which in his mouth meant both never and as soon as I can afford it.\n\nThey had promised themselves a rule about community meetings, and like most rules they\u2019d ever written, its value increased when they broke it. At eleven, a neighborhood association with a fondness for capital letters brought a delegation into the office to explain how a proposed bike lane would steal their peace and their parking and possibly their firstborns. Mason stood slightly to the side and let Jack do the patience, and then he entered with a story about a woman he\u2019d known who\u2019d walked four blocks with her groceries in heat that made your skin into fabric. He never said the word equity. He didn\u2019t have to. When they left, one of the men shook Jack\u2019s hand for too long and whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re not like the others,\u201d which was a kindness and an accusation, both of which were useless and lovely in equal measure.\n\nJack\u2019s mother called at eight after sending a test text that said simply Hat? as if to remind him that there were promises she kept track of that weren\u2019t connected to a committee schedule. He answered and heard the apology in her breath for the tone she\u2019d used last week that had come out sharper than she\u2019d planned. She asked, in a voice that wanted to be casual and couldn\u2019t be, whether his friend\u2014no name, as if to say she wasn\u2019t sure if names were safe\u2014would come Sunday for supper. He told her yes, and she said, \u201cI have a roast that needs an audience,\u201d which was as close as she could come to happy about a thing she knew she might not understand. He hung up and relayed the invitation to Mason by sliding a sticky note across the desk with the word audience written on it in a hand he\u2019d made deliberately slanted, and Mason nodded with the sober joy of a man who had been given permission to belong at a table.\n\nSunday came with the smell of onions like a hymn you didn\u2019t grow up with but learned to hum. Jack\u2019s mother wore her sweater that made her look like a lighthouse keeper on leave, and she had set the table with the good plates that had flowers someone else would have called old-fashioned. She said, \u201cYou\u2019re skinny,\u201d to Jack, which is what she always said, and then she turned to Mason and said, \u201cYou need a hat,\u201d which made Mason grin and lift the hem of his scarf as if to say he was trying, and she pretended to be unmoved by the charm that would have worked on her even if she had insisted for a decade that it did not. They ate with the careful ferocity of people who know the difference between hunger and appetite, and they told the stories they could tell, the ones whose edges were dull enough not to cut. Jack listened to his mother talk about choir as if it were a legislature with a better alto section, and he watched Mason ask questions like he was folding himself into a family and not simply making conversation. After, Mason did dishes without being asked, his sleeves rolled, the river of his forearm working in quiet ways, and Jack\u2019s mother stood with a towel and said nothing for a while and then said, \u201cI like the way you pay attention to pots,\u201d which was the way she knew to say, I see you looking out for the things that are good for my son.\n\nWhen she went upstairs to search for the recipe she had promised and would not find because recipes in her house were more folklore than math, Mason leaned his hip against the counter and said, in a voice that had less air in it than usual, \u201cI think she likes me in the way that matters, and also she scares me just enough to make me behave.\u201d Jack laughed and wanted to put his hands on the square of counter between them and his chest, to anchor the surprise of feeling soft in his mother\u2019s kitchen without the fear that softness would cost him something irretrievable. He brushed his knuckles against Mason\u2019s wrist, a motion that might as well have been a confession, and Mason did not move away. The contact made him briefly brave enough to imagine telling the truth on this tile, in this light, and then his mother\u2019s footsteps sounded on the stairs and he put the thought back in his pocket with the coin and told himself, later, which was a lie he could live with for another hour.\n\nThe hour gave itself up as hours always do, and Monday did its familiar magic of pretending it was a stranger. The morning paper folded itself around a photograph of Jack in the serious coat from two weeks earlier with a headline that tried to be kind to his bill while insulting his haircut, which is how you could tell the editor had managed the compromise of affection and skepticism. Channel 12 called to ask whether he had a comment about a rumor that had stopped being about yoga and started being about money, which was a relief in a way; it is always easier to be accused of the venial sins of funding than the mortal ones of longing. He said, \u201cI have many comments about money. I have none about gossip,\u201d and the anchor laughed, delighted to be given something she could use between a weather map and a story about a squirrel that had gotten into a drafty attic and refused to leave.\n\nHe would have liked the day to stay in those manageable lanes, but instead it decided it wished to be a highway. Before lunch, an email arrived from a news outlet up the road that had discovered FOIA not as an instrument of transparency but as a toy. The subject line was customer-service cheery: FOIA Request: Selected Texts Regarding Transit Policy, and Mason whistled when he saw the sender because he knew the games people played when they wanted to put you on the defensive without saying so. They\u2019d asked for texts from Jack to anyone within a list that included two journalists, a scheduler, and \u201cany consultant or informal advisor.\u201d It was both precise and vague in the way that punished you for refusing to have a staff of fifty. Jack felt his fingers go cold on the keyboard as he read the dates. He thought instantly, absurdly, of the clementine ribbon photograph, and then he told himself to breathe because the photograph did not contain a crime unless you counted the possibility that joy could be evidence.\n\nMason sat on the edge of the desk and made the face he made when he was deciding whether to bring the cousins to the family reunion. \u201cWe have options, and some of them are almost not terrible,\u201d he said, and he listed them the way he would list parts of a speech. \u201cWe can fight scope and look defensive, or we can comply clean and look boring. We can say we used personal devices for personal things and will cull the work texts, which is true, and then everyone will print the single interesting thing and ignore the two hundred logistics about chairs and microphones. We can write our own version first and make sure the headline has our verb in it and not theirs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is their verb?\u201d Jack asked, because he had learned that asking that question made some battles less likely to be lost purely out of stubbornness.\n\n\u201cExpose,\u201d Mason said, and rolled his shoulders as if the word had put a burr under his shirt. \u201cWhat is ours?\u201d\n\n\u201cExplain,\u201d Jack said, and he thought of the boy in the lobby and his grandmother\u2019s pie and the way language shifts when the person using it allows you to sit down.\n\nThey pulled the texts, which felt a little like undressing in the doctor\u2019s office\u2014humiliating only if you imagined an audience you didn\u2019t actually believe deserved a seat. There were long stretches filled with what they had always understood was their true work: Where are you, Fifth and Main, Bring the binder, This microphone hates me, Ms. Pettigrew says the driver sang to the little kids, Call Warren, Channel 12 wants numbers not adjectives, I left you coffee by the window. The clementine coil photo was there, and the caption with its single disobedient verb. There were three separate texts where one of them had typed the word fairness and then corrected it to something else, as if the word itself were a superstition they wouldn\u2019t say aloud in a house that creaked. There was nothing that made their private life into a scandal because they had not let themselves have one, but there was enough to make a certain reader feel they\u2019d been allowed to peek behind a curtain that had always been symbolic more than sturdy.\n\nThe reporter called, as they knew he would, and asked the question as if he was embarrassed for both of them. \u201cIs your staffer your partner?\u201d he said, and the pity in the tone made Jack\u2019s back go up as effectively as an insult would have. He replied with the voice he saved for nurses and for women who came to ask him to hold what they were ashamed to admit they\u2019d been carrying alone. He said, \u201cMy staffer is one of the reasons I can do my job. He buys me almonds and refuses to let me embarrass myself in public. Our texts will show you that I can forget to eat lunch and that he believes in clementines. They will also show we talk about bus stops more than is healthy, and that we used the word expand in a way that will improve the life of a woman with a stroller.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are saying,\u201d the reporter said, and the phrase unrolled like a rug you had to choose whether to admire or trip on. \u201cPeople are saying you\u2019ve misled your constituents about who is whispering in your ear.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are saying a lot,\u201d Jack said, and he kept his voice from going brittle by thinking about the whale scarf and the hawk in the tree. \u201cI\u2019m telling you that the whispering is almost always about verbs and chairs, and sometimes about pie.\u201d\n\nWhen he hung up, he realized his hands were shaking, which was an indignity he hadn\u2019t suffered with any regularity since the day he\u2019d sat in a basement hallway and discovered his father\u2019s tie was a knot he could untie by himself. Mason stood close and then closer, not touching, but making the kind of heat that made touching almost unnecessary. He said, in a register that noticed the tremor without making it the whole story, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be thanked for any version of this. We can at least decide who we\u2019d rather be blamed by. I vote we choose the people who bring us pie.\u201d\n\nThe news did what the news does and grazed them on its way to the next bright thing. The story ran online with a photograph of a bus that did not belong to their city and a headline that managed to put Jack\u2019s name next to the word ally as if they had invented each other. The comments learned nothing. The donors decided to wait, though Mr. Halloran\u2019s assistant sent a friendly note that translated to, The way you bury the lede could use work, which made Mason laugh hard enough to have to put a hand on the file cabinet. The mayor called and did the thing where he pretended he had never said the word predictable. Ms. Pettigrew texted, simply, Pie forever, and the boy added an emoji that Mason had to explain to Jack with a straight face.\n\nThe floor vote on transit came scheduled like bad weather. Jack counted heads as carefully as a mother counts children in a crosswalk and found, every time, that one of them had wandered off to look at a squirrel. He had five speeches he could give depending on the direction of the wind and one he wanted to give that made no mention of cost recovery and many mentions of people who do their jobs while being insulted by strangers. Mason, in the gallery, wore the tie Jack had told him made him look like he had a plan, and he sat so still he might have been an architectural feature. They rehearsed their verbs by eye contact until it was time for the vote, and then they stopped speaking even that language because the quiet you owe a vote is like the quiet you owe a prayer.\n\nIt went as good and as dumb as these things go. A man who had told Jack in the elevator that he believed in the bill as a gift to the city rose and said a string of sentences that made the thing sound like a boogeyman stealing silverware. A freshman with his hair still in the shape of the rush he\u2019d ridden in on told a story about a bus driver who had saved his grandmother from a thunderstorm when he was nine, and the metaphor got lost in the thunder, but the room clapped anyway because sometimes clapping is the only correct answer. When it was his turn, Jack did the sentence he had been practicing in his mouth all morning, and it sat in the air the way a sturdy bench sits where you can find it when you need to sit down. He said the number and didn\u2019t swagger. He said the word expand only twice because too much of a good word can turn it greedy. He said, toward the end when he could feel some of the heads turn toward him instead of toward the clock, \u201cWe can do better,\u201d and the anchor\u2019s face who had shaved his hair into politeness the night before softened in the second row, which shouldn\u2019t have mattered and did.\n\nThe board lit the way boards do, like a bell that doesn\u2019t want to ring, and names turned green and red with a rhythm that was almost vulgar because of how easily it reduced the air to yes and no. He realized he had been holding his breath when he heard himself exhale and thought, absurdly, of the coin and of Mason\u2019s breath across a sofa months ago when the lamps had made them both look like they had been discovered in an attic and brought back into use. The bill passed by the margin he had predicted in the way that makes a man want to stop predicting and let himself be surprised. There was clapping, not polite but not ecstatic; there were handshakes from men who wanted to be in the photograph without having to vote to be in the photograph; there was a note that slid into his palm from a woman who had voted no and was brave enough to put a heart next to her apology.\n\nHe found Mason in the corridor, because of course he did; the building arranged itself so they could always perform the trick of bumping into each other as if it were fate and not choreography. They didn\u2019t speak at first because the air in the hall belonged to everyone and they had decided, recently and without a formal declaration, that they would not take things that weren\u2019t theirs. Mason touched his sleeve lightly, as if to confirm the fabric had not been changed by victory. He said, not in a whisper because whispering admits guilt too easily, \u201cYou were precise. You didn\u2019t give away any bagels,\u201d and Jack grinned and allowed himself the smallest cruelty of thinking of Mr. Halloran\u2019s face. He wanted foolishly to put his hand against Mason\u2019s tie and smooth it, not because it needed smoothing but because his fingers needed proof, and instead he gestured vaguely toward the river and then remembered they had agreed not to deploy that as a code every time the world made them too large for rooms.\n\n\u201cTonight,\u201d Mason said, reading the gesture anyway and translating it to something that wouldn\u2019t be mistaken by the wrong ears. \u201cWe can go and watch the water pretend to be going somewhere else. Or we can eat in a place where no one knows us and pretend food can fix everything,\u201d and Jack said they could do both because he had decided they were now people who got both when there were honest ways to take it.\n\nThey chose a diner with a cracked checkerboard floor and a waitress who had been calling men honey since Reagan and had perfected the art so it never sounded like insult. They slid into a booth where the vinyl protested with a sound like someone older than them getting up. Mason ordered pancakes because he refused to believe you needed permission to have them after noon, and Jack ordered an omelet and decided, loudly enough for the waitress to snort, to leave the broccoli in. They did not speak about the bill until after the plates had been set down because sometimes victory is a fragile creature you must let settle before you ask it to perform. They talked instead about the man counting change at the counter who had a smile that made every tooth look like a confession, and about the woman in the corner teaching her mother to use a phone with that stern humor daughters learn when they have had to ask their mothers to be young and their mothers have refused.\n\nWhen they did talk about the bill, they didn\u2019t talk about it in terms of triumph. Mason said, \u201cHere is the list of the first ten people who will be outraged when the bus changes route for five minutes to pick up a woman with a stroller,\u201d and Jack said, \u201cHere is the draft of the apology letter that is not an apology,\u201d and they laughed because that was the only correct answer when faced with the fact that doing a thing cracks a different thing. The waitress refilled their coffee and said, \u201cYou two boys look tired like you\u2019re proud of it,\u201d and Jack felt something physical in his chest loosen because someone had called them boys as a tenderness and not a diminution. He wanted to hold the word and examine it for impurities, and then he let it go because hoarding kindness ruins it.\n\nOutside, the sky had the scraped-clean look it gets after weather has tried and failed to keep your attention. They didn\u2019t need to say river; they found their feet pointing that way because habit is its own language. The bridge hummed like a machine that meant well. On the rocks, the light had changed to that late-day pewter that made even the graffiti look deliberate. The possum with the crown had been painted over by a hand that didn\u2019t know reverence when it saw it, and someone had written in chalk beneath the new, less charming cartoon: YOU CAN\u2019T ERASE JOY, which was a claim and a dare. They sat and the cold ran up through their shoes in a way that wasn\u2019t unkind. Everything in him wanted to decide fast and be done with wanting. He let himself be slow because speed had never made him braver, only louder.\n\n\u201cSix weeks,\u201d Mason said, almost smiling at the number\u2019s neatness as if a clean integer could discipline the chaos. \u201cIt turns out time is both a schedule and a weapon. I have learned the names of three people I am supposed to call when I want something to be two floors away in five minutes. I have also learned the name of the woman who runs the coffee stand and knows when I am lying to her about sugar. I stood outside a building made of glass that announces itself without humility and thought, I could be good here and hate it, or I could be lonely and call it merit. And then I got on a train that thought itself very important and came home because there is a dog here that refuses a leash and a boy with a scar and your mother\u2019s roast and a bill written with the right verb.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you do with the letter?\u201d Jack asked him, because that was his way of asking laboriously, What are you going to do with me, and he could not bear to pose it naked.\n\n\u201cI wrote the subject line,\u201d Mason said, and it made Jack laugh when he didn\u2019t expect to. \u201cI wrote, In which I attempt to choose both, and then I didn\u2019t write the body because I wanted to see whether the river could make the rest of the sentences honest. They will be about the way I am greedy for rooms where I can be someone who says sentences like these without the ceiling deciding to fall. They will be about how I intend to keep a key in a place you can find by feel.\u201d\n\nThey were careful for a long minute not to look at each other because looking makes things either grow or die, and neither of them had the courage to watch for that. A train slid across the far bridge as if it were the border of a slow-motion film, and he could feel the vibration in the rock beneath him the way you feel a lover pass your chair at midnight in a kitchen full of laughter. He thought of the word kiss and did not make it into a sentence. He thought of the word stay and did not believe it would bring the ceiling down if he spoke it to a man who had already read it into a picture of fruit.\n\n\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, which was the same sentence as before and not at all the same, because now he meant a different kind of closeness. He didn\u2019t stand. He didn\u2019t perform. He put his hand on the back of Mason\u2019s neck because that part of the body is a hinge, and he pressed his mouth to Mason\u2019s mouth with the care of a man who had rehearsed this gesture unconsciously for so long he was a professional at restraint. It wasn\u2019t cinematic; there was neither music nor perfection. It was a learning. It was a press and a breath and the discovery of a heat he had carried alone so long he had forgotten it could belong to two people without violating a statute. When they separated, which they did before the world had a chance to catch them at it, they sat back slightly and let their faces be blank for the birds and the teenagers practicing adulthood on the far bank. The only hint anything had changed at all was the way Jack\u2019s breath came like a man who had been underwater and had not drowned.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make mistakes,\u201d Mason said, and his voice had the stability of someone who had finally decided to stop arguing with gravity. \u201cI am going to choose the wrong hour to call and the wrong joke at a meeting and the wrong shirt to meet your mother. I am going to forget which elevator is the one that behaves and I am going to be asked by a man I don\u2019t respect to give up things I do. I am going to hate D.C. in a sincere way and then I am going to hate the way it stops making me feel special, and both will be ugly on me. I am also going to carry almonds and learn the word luminaire without rolling my eyes and I am going to remember where you keep the coin even when you move it to punish me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am going to say sorry for things that don\u2019t deserve it and not say it when it matters,\u201d Jack said, feeling his mouth warm with the list as if he had been waiting years to audition for a part. \u201cI am going to allow men to talk themselves into circles because it loosens their collars, and then I am going to resent the clock for not being the companion I want. I am going to refuse to be small in rooms where people would like me to be smaller, and then I am going to be tempted to make myself into a shadow so I can keep my good things. I am going to fail at privacy in public and privacy in private. I am going to forget to eat and remember to bring soup. I am going to bring you a tie that is wrong and you will love me and the tie anyway.\u201d\n\nThey sat until cold did its particular preaching. They stood carefully because you can fall out of happiness if you move too fast. They walked back not touching and touching, a choreography they could perform without rehearsal, and when they reached the path where the chalked message about joy insisted on itself, they stepped around it because they had no interest in becoming the kind of men who put their feet on declarations for the irony of it. Back at the office, the pie on the file cabinet had settled into itself and had probably begun to give up on them. Mason cut two slices like a man performing a ritual he did not want an audience for and worshiped anyway. He placed the coin beside the plate like a sacrament. They ate with forks they didn\u2019t deserve and they laughed when sugar did its bright sting.\n\nThat night, because the city had a calendar, they went to a vigil in a park for a man nobody important had learned and everybody in his block had loved. Candles sputtered in paper cups like fight surrenders into heat, and a woman with a voice that did not need amplification sang a line that made the hair on Jack\u2019s forearms stand at attention. He saw men in suits pretending they had stumbled upon the event and quietly calculating where to stand for maximum empathy per square inch. He saw the boy from the lobby holding his scarf like a mouth and not crying because he had told himself he wasn\u2019t a kid anymore and then deciding to cry anyway because being a person is better than performing a version of one. He felt Mason\u2019s shoulder a rumor against his. When the song ended, a woman stood and said, \u201cWe do not ask for permission to grieve,\u201d and since grief and joy are sometimes the same discipline in different outfits, Jack thought, We do not ask for permission to love either, and he held that line like a rail as the night shifted toward cold and broke without warning into kind.\n\nAt home, he put the coin into the bowl where he kept keys and imagined it adding its small weight to the other things he needed to leave and return. He called his mother and told her nothing and everything in the careful way they had perfected: that he ate, that he slept, that his day had done the thing days do and insisted, that the roast had been exactly right, that her kitchen had been the safest place in the city for an hour even though the smoke alarm had asserted itself with unnecessary drama. She told him, unprompted, \u201cTell your friend that he can borrow a hat,\u201d which made him laugh into the receiver and say he would, and then she said, \u201cYou sound less alone,\u201d in a tone that wanted to be brisk and failed, and he said, \u201cI am,\u201d and that was enough for a night.\n\nMorning put on its business clothes and demanded their receipt. The mayor sent a statement that did its best to take credit for everything and blame for nothing, which is his species\u2019 native tongue. Mr. Halloran\u2019s assistant wrote, Emotions aside, can we talk TIF language, which made Mason write a reply that said, Emotions are how people live in a city, also yes, which was the compromise he\u2019d trained himself to be good at. Ms. Pettigrew sent a photograph of the boy with his butterflied chin at an angle that made him look far too ready for a life in which he would have to insist, and a caption that read, Baby thinks he invented hardship, bless his heart, and Jack loved her with a fierceness that had nothing to do with legislative obligations. The dog ran leashless again and looked back only once, and it was at them. Warren told them he was thinking of retiring and then smiled to make them panic and then said, Not yet, which was his favorite joke because it proved he could still feel indispensable.\n\nOn Wednesday, the city decided it had not had a proper argument in weeks and supplied one. The streetlight contractor failed to deliver three poles and a promise, and a reporter with a flair for theater balanced herself on an unlit corner and demanded to know if Jack had ever walked in the dark himself. He considered saying, Every day, and then decided to talk instead about bulbs and timelines and the way darkness covers everyone in a way that is both democratic and cruel. He said, \u201cWe will not allow infrastructure to be a metaphor,\u201d and Mason pinched the bridge of his nose, because sentences that pretty were both medicine and opiate in his view, and they had made a rule about those too.\n\nThe letter to D.C. got written in the quiet after a meeting where three expensive men had advised them to stop talking about buses like people. Mason closed the office door with his foot and leaned on the glass as if trying to impress upon the building itself the importance of being exhausted at the right time. He wrote with his hand in a way that hurt and then, at the end because there are rituals and he honored some of them, he typed it for form. He gave it the subject line he\u2019d promised and then he sent it and then he stood there with his palms on the desk like a man who had pushed a car up a hill and was waiting for the engine to decide whether it would catch. He said, without looking up, \u201cI chose both,\u201d and Jack said, \u201cGood,\u201d and he meant, I know what that costs and I will pay some of it with you even when that is inconvenient and ungenerous in equal measure.\n\nThey told no one who would make it smaller by knowing. They told the pie. They told the coin. They told the river, which did its old work and didn\u2019t need their sentences to keep going. They told the dog by bumping his shoulder on the way past and letting him forgive them because forgiveness is a skill dogs practice for the joy of it. They left their office light on a few minutes past the hour because the building liked that and they were sentimental men and trained themselves to pretend they weren\u2019t.\n\nThe next weekend, his mother called and said, \u201cI bought a hat,\u201d and the word made a perfect circle in his ear like the coin he did not carry to her kitchen. She added, because she knew who she was in this story and did not wish to shirk it, \u201cI bought two. One is uglier. He gets the other.\u201d He laughed and said he would tell him, and when he relayed it, Mason put his forehead against the door frame the way he had done that night when all they had to declare was proximity. He said, \u201cYour mother and I will collude against you,\u201d and Jack said, \u201cI know,\u201d and stood there with his hands in his pockets like a boy who has decided he can take more than one kind of risk and still keep his shoes tied.\n\nThe city continued in its stubborn, beloved way. A new mural went up of three women with their arms around each other looking like they\u2019d been told to smile and had chosen, instead, to smirk because that would last longer. A man in a suit fell on the ice in front of a church and stood and bowed to no one, as if to insist that dignity could be made out of a good fall. Ms. Pettigrew\u2019s boy learned to make a pie crust that did not crumble and then pretended he had invented pastry. The boy at the meeting who had asked about drones sent him a direct message that said, I got into art school, which made Jack sit with his phone in his hand for a long minute and then type, I am proud of a person I have only technically met, and then erase it and send a heart, which was both less and more.\n\nOn a Tuesday that had not announced itself as important, a bus driver pulled over because the boy with the scar had stood and recited to him the schedule changes with such authority that the driver had laughed and invited him to sit up front and use the microphone if he thought he could do better. The boy did, and Ms. Pettigrew filmed it, and the clip made a small, honest noise on the internet, a noise that was neither outrage nor cynicism, only a cheer in a register people had forgotten was permitted. Channel 12 called and offered to do a spot that was not about potholes, and Jack said yes because sometimes you say yes just to prove your mouth remembers how.\n\nThat night, at the edge of the river where night puts its elbows on the rail and listens, they stood without touching and touched without moving, which had become, accidentally, their new talent. Mason said, \u201cTell me the worst thing,\u201d and Jack said, \u201cThe worst thing is that I will want to hide you when I should want to show you,\u201d and then he asked it back and Mason said, \u201cThe worst thing is I will want to show you when I should want to hide you,\u201d and they both laughed because this, at least, could be a game they played to remind themselves there were limits and there were none. He took the coin from his pocket and set it on the rail and then put his hand over it as if he were daring the wind, and he felt Mason\u2019s palm over his, the warm architecture of fingers and a wrist he had learned like a street. For a second he let himself believe they were the only two people awake. Then the train crossed and the city breathed and the night applauded them for simply staying, and he allowed himself to think, briefly and without punishment, that maybe, after all, the second chapter had decided to be easier.",

The white dog went missing for a week, which made everyone in the building superstitious without admitting it, and then reappeared wearing a bandanna like a pirate who had been rescued and returned a little prouder. The river, indifferent to appropriations, shouldered along the same rock spines, and Jack smoothed the bills and the numbers and the grins that turned into demands as if he were ironing the sheets of a small hotel where you wanted the guests to think the beds made themselves. Mason came and went on trains that began to feel like a third person in the room, and in the way of good trains they were sometimes early and sometimes a weapon and often an alibi no one had requested and everyone used.\n\nOn a Tuesday that had pretended to be a Thursday all morning, the mayor invited seven of them to a breakfast in a hotel ballroom that had spent real money on chandeliers and none on the coffee. The pancakes came in a stack that looked like a photograph of a stack, and a councilman whose default setting was contrite gave a toast that ended with the phrase \u201cpublic-private partnership\u201d like a promise he thought he could make and keep with the same sentence. Jack ate a bite of egg too big to be elegant because hunger doesn\u2019t wait for applause, and he felt rather than saw the movement at the far door where the donors did theater about arriving late. Mr. Halloran\u2019s assistant gave him a smile that admitted she had read all the same memos he had and liked some of them more than he did, and then she angled through the crowd like someone who had practiced moving through water in a dress that had opinions.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate your willingness to be reasonable,\u201d she said, which was the warmest version of what she meant, and he admired her for choosing the nice word even when the instrument she wanted was a wrench. He told her, politely, that reasonableness was in his pocket next to the coin and that he would bring it out in public when the city could be trusted not to spend it on the wrong thing. Mason watched him from the edge of the dais that wanted to be a stage and texted him a drawing of a man juggling four lamps and a bus, and underneath it he wrote, Smile with your eyes and not your mouth, which sounded like a joke and was a technique, and Jack followed it as if the second row were a mirror he could trust.\n\nThe photograph of them at the river had been taken by no one and also by everyone, because the world by now and for years had taught itself how to see without asking permission. It wasn\u2019t a kiss, because they were not careless or brave in that particular way yet, and it wasn\u2019t nothing, because you could see the way their shoulders had decided to be honest even when their mouths were not. Someone sent it to Channel 12 and to a blog that was less interested in transit than it was in the transit of feelings across men\u2019s faces, and then the photographs did what photographs do and showed up in places that had no business being interested in them and therefore were. The anchor with the neat hair called to warn him because courtesy had not yet gone wholly out of style, and she added with a tone that tried to balance a weighing pan, \u201cThey\u2019ll say it says something. You can decide what.\u201d\n\nHe walked to the window because the window had never lied to him. In the lawn a school group tried to listen with the patience of their teacher\u2019s faith, and one boy had peeled off from the line to put his whole face to the ground to see a bug, which felt like the moral he never had time to make himself learn. Mason read the article with the kind of attention he usually reserved for punctuation in a contract, and when he finished he looked at Jack the way he\u2019d looked at the serious coat the first time, as if to say, You can wear this, but you do not have to let it choose you. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t accuse,\u201d he said mildly, tapping the screen with a finger he had disciplined. \u201cIt insinuates. It winks. It will force you to respond to a tone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am better at numbers than tone,\u201d Jack said, and he wasn\u2019t wrong about that even if a good day made him wish he could afford to be. \u201cWe could say nothing and let it spend itself. We could say too much and teach it to reproduce.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could write our own headline again,\u201d Mason said, and he made the small smile that had never stopped being a risk in a room, even now. \u201cWe can say this: A man who rides the bus and carries almonds loves a man who says expand instead of enhance, and together they intend to lower your wait time and raise your expectations. That\u2019s either the end of something or the beginning of a new chapter in which the city minds its business in the way that means it gets done.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be the story,\u201d Jack said, and the honesty of it made him sound like someone he would have mocked on the floor five years ago. \u201cI want the bus to be the story. I want Ms. Pettigrew\u2019s boy and his glued chin to be the story. I want the dog to be the story every day before my tie.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are the story when they decide you are the story,\u201d Mason said gently, and he didn\u2019t put his hand on Jack\u2019s wrist even though he wanted to. \u201cWe can make the story tell itself better. Or we can stand here and force it to write its own shabby copy.\u201d\n\nThey had talked for months in rooms with and without locks about telling. They had made a list on a napkin once of the words they would not accept in any article about them and then laughed like men who know lists are exactly the kind of control that goes slack at the first bend in the road. They had practiced sentences, not because they planned to perform all of them but because rehearsal is its own kind of courage and kept the panic from turning into improvisation. At the end of every practice, they had rummaged around for proof, for the little objects that made the day feel attached to their bodies and not to the current running through the building. Sometimes the proof was a clementine, which was happy and difficult to argue with. Sometimes the proof was a list of names of women who had given up lunch to get to a hearing. Sometimes the proof was the coin, a brazen admission that he held luck where he could and that he refused to let the marble apologize for being beautiful.\n\nThey wrote a statement at the little table in the office where they wrote everything important, because small tables make honesty feel heavier than the room can get away with. They did the sentences in pieces and then stood them up and walked around them the way you walk around a chair someone has built for you, checking for wobble you can sand out before you ask people to sit. They started with the bill because it was true that this day had been meant to be about sidewalks and timing and the way light can protect you and the way it can fail you and how both of those are the council\u2019s fault if they are asleep, and they moved to verbs because verbs had become a bridge for them more than once. The paragraph about what you call two men who lean toward each other and refuse to be ashamed took all the time it was going to take, and they let it because speed is not a virtue on certain kinds of roads.\n\n\u201cWe could say it is none of your business and also I love him,\u201d Jack said, and he heard how it could sound like arrogance and also like a man with a kitchen table and no intention of inviting anyone to judge the soup. \u201cWe could skip the love and say we\u2019re colleagues and friends and keep pretending the rest, which would be the old honesty that did not deserve its name.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeak the first sentence,\u201d Mason said, and his voice had gone into the register where it got quiet because he was being brave and needed oxygen. \u201cWe owe them only the first sentence. The rest we owe ourselves.\u201d\n\nWhen the statement ran, it sat there like a chair in the middle of a room where some people had been pretending they were not tired. People either ignored it because their list of things to ignore was longer than their list of things to attend to, or they read it twice and then sent it to their sister, or they said the word finally like a souvenir from another city they had visited once and thought about moving to. Some of them said rude things because rudeness is free and requires nothing but an underused thumb and an imagination that runs only on insult. Some of them said beautiful things that did not belong to them because they had never had to be brave like this and wanted to borrow. Ms. Pettigrew called and said, \u201cBaby, I do not care who you kiss if you keep that bus from being late,\u201d which was the best and truest sentence his phone would ever carry and he wanted to put it in his wallet and present it like a card when someone at a podium tried to make him into a moral they had written in advance. His mother said, \u201cI already bought him a hat,\u201d and then she said, after the deliberate pause that proved she had considered all the ways she might be unkind and rejected them, \u201cBring him for supper.\u201d\n\nThe outrage that had been promised by those who needed it to feel important lasted through lunch and became the kind of complaining that makes a room seem busier than it is. Jack went down to the plaza with a sandwich he did not intend to eat and found the dog sprawled in the thin sun like an old man remembering being fast. A child in a frog-green jacket asked if the dog belonged to him, and he said, \u201cI think he belongs to the weather,\u201d and the child nodded because children have a better sense for ownership than anyone and knew that some things can be shared by everyone and held by no one. Two teenagers sat on the edge of the planter making a video that involved both of them falling on purpose and one of them laughing more than the other, and a woman with an umbrella used it like an extension of her arm to point to the part of the railing she wanted fixed because her mother used it to lower herself and that should have been in the budget last time and was not.\n\nThe first person who said something cruel said it as a test, which is always a kindness compared to saying it as a sport. He stood too close and smiled too big and used the word traditional the way you use a door that should have been oiled. He said that Jack had lost his mind to a coastal agenda even though the nearest coast was perennially shocked to discover how often the river ate its own edges. Jack let him finish because you owe people the dignity of finishing when they want to be rude to your face. Then he said, \u201cWe\u2019re talking about your streetlight, sir. We\u2019re talking about timing and dollars and the fact that we can do better by the walker you haven\u2019t noticed because you use a garage,\u201d and the man got flustered because decency was not the reply he had rehearsed for his own applause. He backed away and muttered something that had furniture words in it and then he fell silent because the dog had decided the man might have a treat and had laid his head on the man\u2019s knee in a way that was a plea and an absolution. The man reached down and scratched the dog\u2019s ears and then left without telling Jack his name, which was the best ending to that story they could have asked for.\n\nMason\u2019s train that night was late and late again. He texted apologies as if the train were a toddler who needed you to point to the clock to understand responsibility, and Jack wanted to send him an old paper schedule of buses to remind him that lateness is a language they had both learned as children and had been trying to translate into kindness. He walked down to the river alone because the air felt like the throat of a song and he didn\u2019t want to stand in his kitchen pretending to be patient. The rocks were a study in how unromantic the truth looks in daylight and how it becomes a chapel when it wants to. He sat with his knees apart the way you sit when you refuse to fold yourself for the comfort of a bench, and he watched two boys in jackets that had cost both too much and not enough light one cigarette and then correct themselves and put it out because their own lungs gave them the sermon their mothers had tried to. The red of the butt against the patches of old snow made him think of his niece\u2019s whales and the way small absurdities keep people honest.\n\nHe heard the footsteps he wanted before he saw the person he wanted, which should have felt like a metaphor and was only the relief of someone you loved not being a ghost. Mason sat without the drama of a sigh because he had always been careful about not giving the river reasons to think him theatrical. They didn\u2019t speak for long enough that the cold could make their bones aware of themselves. Then Mason said, \u201cMy mother called to tell me the news as if I didn\u2019t know, and then she told me about a woman at church who is sure she invented kindness in 1972 and wants to license it,\u201d and Jack laughed because Mason could make a complicated love for his mother sound like an accurate weather report. He told him about the dog being owned by the weather, and Mason nodded and said, \u201cThat checks,\u201d and put his hand on the rock near Jack\u2019s hand but not over it because the night still felt like it would forgive them only in increments.\n\n\u201cI thought it would be worse,\u201d Jack said, and he meant the day, and he meant that he had been braced since adolescence for a disaster that would carry the angle of a headline. \u201cI thought the building would turn its back. It only tilted. People said beautiful things with too many exclamation points and rude things with too many capital letters, and then they went back to worrying about the bus.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey went back to worrying about themselves,\u201d Mason said, and there was no judgment in it. \u201cIt\u2019s the only honest way to live in a city. I kept waiting for a man in a suit to pat me on the head and say he forgave me for existing, and instead a woman at the coffee stand called me darling and gave me the wrong change and I gave it back, and we both behaved like we\u2019d done something radical.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d Jack said, and he wanted to lean his head on Mason\u2019s shoulder the way a boy puts his head on a desk late in the day when the numbers turn to soup. \u201cWe did. I feel lighter in a way I do not trust yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll learn to carry it,\u201d Mason said, and he said the words like he was opening a cupboard to show Jack where the bowls lived. \u201cNot because we are noble. Because we have to lift other things and we can\u2019t do that with one arm.\u201d\n\nTheir privacy didn\u2019t shatter so much as rearrange. People who hadn\u2019t felt permitted to ask now felt permitted to ask and then discovered their questions were poor and deserved to be replaced with better ones. People who had known all along because the world teaches you how to recognize people who are breathing for each other said nothing and started bringing them information you can only get when you\u2019re trusted not to waste it. Mothers brought hats. Boys brought jokes. The white dog brought his own face to press against their knee and expected nothing but a message sent through skin: you belong. In the building, eyes had always watched them for other reasons, and now they watched them for this as if this were the most interesting part of the work, which it wasn\u2019t and was. They set rules for themselves and then they broke them two at a time, and then they wrote new ones because the point was not to be perfect but to be decent and the only way to be decent is to admit failure while attempting repair.\n\nWhat broke was not the ceiling or the floor; it was a small restraint Jack had learned at fourteen and refined at twenty-five, the one that kept his hand from reaching across the desk when no one would think to look. He was distracted in new ways that felt like old ones. He stood by the window and watched the boy with the scar touch his chin and pretend he had survived a war when he had only survived adolescence, which might be harder, and he let himself be happy in front of Warren, who clucked his tongue and hid a grin in the paperwork he had been threatening to retire behind for a decade. He wrote sentences for a hearing about alley lights that had nearly too much light in them, and he took one out because he could hear Mason\u2019s throat clearing in the margin and wanted to beat him to it.\n\nThe next wave broke as small and mean as gossip always is, curled around a convenience store on the edge of a district that had been promised more than it got. The photo of the river drew out a man who ran a weekly that was running out of weeks and liked to resuscitate himself with oxygen stolen from other people\u2019s lungs. He wrote about \u201cthe whisper network\u201d and \u201cthe corridor grapevine\u201d and pretended he was quoting someone when he put the word compromised in a sentence with Jack\u2019s name, as if love were a contaminant and not the only reason anyone stayed long enough to write a better paragraph. In the comments a woman wrote, \u201cI do not care who he loves, I care where the bus is,\u201d and a man wrote, \u201cI do not care where the bus is, I care about sin,\u201d and a third person wrote, \u201cThe bus is on Broad if you\u2019d like to go see it,\u201d and then the thread degenerated, and that was a mercy because degenerating threads do less harm than tidy arguments.\n\nMason wanted to punch a wall in the way of men who have learned not to and instead walked around the block and pretended to be on the phone with a cousin. He came back with red in his cheeks and a plan that involved writing entirely too much down and then throwing half of it away. He said, \u201cWe could sue, and then we would be men who sued and lost time we could be spending on alley lights, so we won\u2019t. We could ignore it and let it calcify into something that keeps us from breathing, so we won\u2019t. We are going to do the boring thing that works. We are going to say, again, that love is not a line item, and that all the lines we care about are on a schedule.\u201d\n\nThey walked to a barber shop everyone agreed was neutral ground because its owner had learned the art of letting people lie to themselves while he cut their hair into honesty. The televisions played old Warriors footage and a rerun of a game show that had never been as kind as the host pretended, and the clippings fell like tough confetti. When the barber finished with a man who had come in angry and left with his eyebrows in a new arrangement named \u201cMaybe,\u201d he looked at Jack and said, \u201cI got your picture in my window,\u201d and Jack braced himself and then saw the photograph with the caption HANDSOME MEN, BAD HAIRCUTS, VOTE ANYWAY, and he laughed with the kind of relief that makes your knees untrustworthy.\n\nIt was almost a relief when the actual scandal arrived with a budget line you could circle and a name you could pronounce. The contractor with the streetlight poles had bid low enough to get the job and high enough to pay for three beach houses, and he had done it with the help of a nephew who had not technically joined the firm and had technically joined every person in the building\u2019s holiday party photographs. A reporter with freckles and a merciless affection for documents brought a printout to Jack the way a woman used to bring a pie to a man who had helped her with a fence, and she said, \u201cYou want to yell at me about timing,\u201d and he said, \u201cNo, I want to tell you thank you and also to bring a sweater because the hearing room thinks it is a church that punishes knees.\u201d\n\nThey called the committee to a special session and Mason did the thing where he stood still enough to be mistaken for an architectural feature and then moved just enough to make a row of men adjust their ties. Jack did the careful anger that works better than thunder, and he put the words transparent and predictable in the same sentence and almost didn\u2019t flinch at the double-edged nature of both. They asked for invoices and got shrugs, and asked for contracts and got this\u2019ll-take-a-minute, and he watched two men discover on television that they had not known how to hide a favor with any competence and breathed, uncharitably, like a man who is relieved he got to call someone else to the carpet. The mayor\u2019s office sent over a man with a voice like the sound of a credit card being declined and asked to be allowed to pretend they had been surprised by the sunrise, and Jack gave him that dignity because he knew he would need the mayor for a vote on alley lights in two days and because meanness glues itself to you long after the applause is over.\n\nThe boy with the scar came to sit in the back row and made a show of not listening, which is to say he listened like a man getting ready to tell the story later in a way that would make him the hero and also honest. Ms. Pettigrew wore a hat that had acquired a small bird that must have been sent over by a niece with an eye for mischief, and when a delegate who had never ridden the bus attempted to make a joke about how nice it was to have company in the public seats, she fixed him with a look that had seen through enough men to fill an index and said, \u201cWe are the public here,\u201d which ended the attempt with the kind of grace that doesn\u2019t need applause to be fulfilling. The white dog, as if to support the idea that not everything was about them, chose that moment to gallop past the open door in pursuit of a pigeon that did not care to be pursued, and everyone watched it because animals are the appropriate intermission for human nonsense.\n\nMason\u2019s letter from D.C. came back with a tone that had practiced sounding reasonable. They wanted him for more hours and fewer complications, which translated to \u201cWe are going to pretend this is a meritocracy while we count your steps,\u201d and he read it with the same face he used for line edits on a draft that had good bones but had been decorated with adjectives like cheap jewelry. \u201cI can do this,\u201d he said, and then, because rehearsal is honesty, he added, \u201cI can hate this and still do it, but I am not going to pretend my hate is nobler than my want.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou once told me that you are happiest when you are interesting to yourself,\u201d Jack said, and he didn\u2019t know that the sentence would land in Mason\u2019s chest and rearrange furniture. \u201cIf they take that from you, leave. If they let you keep it, stay, and write the stupid reports we will both use to make a thing we cannot make here without permission. Then come home, and we will commit the wild sin of trying to have more than one city.\u201d\n\nHe did not lose the coin because he kept it where he was: in his pocket during hearings, on the desk like a talisman in the afternoons, under the pillow on nights when the building made noises that sounded like bad news getting dressed. He found a second coin without meaning to, a token from a carousel they had found half-lit at a church fair in a neighborhood that wanted more light than it had. He put the carousel coin next to the marble one one night and thought, a little giddy with the metaphor pressing too hard, that he was collecting circles in the hope that their perfect shapes would teach his life how to make good turns. He did not tell Mason about the second coin because he was learning the difference between secrecy and the slow pleasure of saving an anecdote for later. He brought it out once when they were at his mother\u2019s and the world had arranged itself precisely enough that small presents and soft jokes were appropriate and did not have to be explained.\n\nHis mother, who had trained herself to call Mason by his name and then, without fanfare, to add \u201cbaby\u201d when she forgot, watched the two of them move plates like men who had done this since they were boys and said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen worse pairs try to carry a sofa,\u201d which was as much as she was prepared to indulge poetic metaphor in her kitchen. She did not pry beyond the kind of questions that let her own heart stop rehearsing catastrophe\u2014Are you eating, are you sleeping, when are you both coming next, and have you seen the neighbor\u2019s begonias\u2014and she did not look at them for longer than she needed to make the space around the table big enough for what they had decided to allow. When Mason broke a glass and cursed the way you curse when you\u2019re annoyed more than sorry, she laughed and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll pay with a pie,\u201d which was not a penalty in any world they believed in.\n\nThe week of the budget vote, the photographer who had taken the river picture sent a note in a hand that went sidewise politely asking for credit. She wrote that she hadn\u2019t meant to make trouble and had wanted only to save something. She said that she had cried in her car after she saw the article because she had known what she was doing when she took the photo and had not known what the world would do with it, which is an ignorance that should be protected with fences and kindness. Jack wrote back that it was all right and that she had done no harm that had stuck, and he added that her eye was honest and if she wanted a job that didn\u2019t pay but did feed pie he could introduce her to a world where men wore ties and women carried the day and everyone needed someone who saw.\n\nThe meeting ran long because men liked to hear themselves explain why other people\u2019s needs were smaller when their own were big. Jack sat with his hands folded the way you fold them when you want to keep from pointing, and he unbent a finger only when he had to call a vote. He watched the board light up like a county fair sign and decided, for the hundredth time, that democracy was an ugly horse you kept because it brought you home, and he resisted the urge to use that phrasing in a sentence because he knew Mason would accuse him of writing bumper stickers. When it was over he was too tired to celebrate with grace, which is why the clementine in his pocket felt like mercy; peeling it arranged his mind as if he were proofing a page and discovering he had not committed libel.\n\nThere was a primary, and even though every woman in his office had assured him it would not generate the kind of heat that melts resolve, there was heat. A retired gym teacher who owned four shirts that all had the same idea about stripes declared he intended to take the district back from big-city concerns and also back from road diets and back from the absolute meltdown of manners he associated with men who refused to have lived exactly like his father. He raised money by selling yard signs with fonts that did violence to typography and by telling three cities\u2019 worth of lies about where Jack put his hand when no one was watching. Jack smiled the way you smile when most of the city is kind and part of it, as it must, is not, and he went to living rooms where a woman with a clutch of petitions always had her reading glasses on her head because she had long ago learned that glasses are a gesture as much as a device. He did the slow, ordinary holy work of elections: he asked for trust, he asked for time, he asked for patience, and he learned the names of two more cats and four more children and twelve more men who wanted to tell him about the day they had gone to jail because a police officer had had a bad morning.\n\nMason did not attend every living-room, because they were men who had jobs and a need to keep some air in them, but he came to the ones that mattered in a way you only learn to recognize if you have watched a person make choices over years. He stood by the mantel and made the room better by existing, and he introduced Jack not as a saint but as a man who tries, which is the most you can say and have it be both true and useful. He shook the hand of the retired gym teacher because a day without grace is a day that proves you are not listening to the river, and afterward he said, \u201cI cannot wait for the day when I am allowed to despise people in public,\u201d and Jack laughed so hard he had to sit down for a second on a couch that had been upholstered in the year of someone\u2019s birth.\n\nThe gym teacher conceded on a Tuesday around three, which is when concessions either mean something or don\u2019t, and then he called to accuse Jack of having cheated in a race that had been run in slow motion under three dozen eyes and a camera. Jack told him he had won because more people believed he was the one who would make the bus come on time, and the man said, \u201cI don\u2019t ride the bus,\u201d as if it were a confession of virtue rather than a failure of community. They hung up, and Mason wrote a sentence on the pad that read, Some people will be born atoms, which is the kind of scientific metaphor Jack had trained himself to accept without quibbling about physics in front of a pollster.\n\nOn the night of the concession, they went to a place with bad lighting and a jukebox that insisted on playing songs in the key of 1996. Their waitress wore hair like a siren and remembered every person who had ever tried to talk her into believing he was funny, and when she set their plates down she said, \u201cYou boys looked like a before and after but I can\u2019t tell which one is which,\u201d and she winked as if to tell them not to waste time trying to be cleverer than hunger. They ate with their heads close because noise requires strategy, and afterward they walked to the river because nothing else made sense. The bridge hummed. The water said nothing it hadn\u2019t said last night, which is how you trust it. They stood and let the cold make them aware of their wrists, which had learned each other like streets they knew they could navigate in the dark without running the stop sign.\n\n\u201cAre we brave enough to be boring,\u201d Mason asked, and it was only half a joke because boredom is a solid, noble goal when your days have insisted on performing for an audience. \u201cCan we be men who go home and turn on a television show and yell at the commercials like my grandfather and allow our bodies to be furniture next to each other without making it into a statement?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe built a lock and a room,\u201d Jack said, and he used the hand that was free to balance the coin on two fingers, a cheap trick he was finally getting good at. \u201cWe let people into the hallway. That feels like a compromise I can stand in. I can be on the sofa because I am going to the meeting in the morning, and you can send me three photographs of your ridiculous coffee stand and I will not pretend to be above being charmed.\u201d\n\nThey did go home and be furniture. They watched a show about a hospital where no one should have been allowed to practice medicine, and Jack learned he was the kind of person who yells at fictional doctors about sanitation. He let his head fall back during the second commercial and allowed himself to notice the weight of Mason\u2019s leg pressed against his without making it into a speech. Outside the window, the city was being polite about noise for once, as if it had remembered pace is not always a war. Inside, his phone did what phones do and tried to convince him that attention is the same as care, and he turned it face down and discovered it was easier than he had thought. He fell asleep halfway through a storyline about a man who never learned, and he woke with the coin under his palm and a neck that would require apology and three ibuprofen to forgive him.\n\nSpring turned itself over and showed its underside, which was pollen and loud birds and the structural integrity of hope. The white dog had a puppy show up beside him for two mornings in a row, and then an old woman in a jacket that had the dignity of wool came to collect it because it had jumped her tiny fence and was too sure of its right to happiness for its own good. The boy with the scar came to the office with a backpack and an appointment for what he called a \u201cshadow day,\u201d which he interpreted as an opportunity to be more honest than he needed to and to call strangers sir in a way that made them feel both seventy and blessed. Ms. Pettigrew introduced herself to a donor on the elevator with the kind of handshake that made a donor remember his teacher\u2019s name and his college debt, and later the donor wrote a check and called it a gift, which it was, and also a tax decision, which it was too.\n\nOn a Friday so clean it looked like it had been polished by an older aunt, they took the train north not because they had to but because they had decided they were allowed. They walked a mile to a museum that had an exhibit about maps and how the people who draw them are always admitting a bias and asking you to pretend they haven\u2019t. They read plaques that were the same size as the plaques at home and did not use words more honest than the ones they used at home, and they stood in front of a painting of a river that had been made by a man who had never seen their river and who nevertheless had understood how to make light argument with dark without declaring victory. They went to a diner that had reinvented itself as something else and decided to pretend not to notice except to ask for more salt, and afterward they walked down a block that had seen five revolutions and named none of them correctly. On the train back, Mason leaned his head against the window and counted the minutes the way you count when you are persuading yourself time is an accomplice and not a thief, and Jack watched the trees go by with a gratitude that had less to do with the trees than with the simple fact of being in a seat next to the person he wanted to be next to when the world was boring.\n\nBy summer, the boys on the rocks drew different names and harder lines, and the graffiti had learned a new hand that loved serpentines and words that curled into themselves like rope. The heat made the office hold smells more closely than it had any right to, and the pie, when it came, arrived with a resigned air as if it understood keeping its texture was a losing battle it would fight anyway. The white dog shed into a visible cloud you could have taken a handful of and made into a small sweater, and the man who seemed to belong to the dog installed himself under the elm on the corner like a benevolent monarch who refused to sit on the throne and instead asked to be consulted in the ordinary way. Ms. Pettigrew bought a fan and put it in the window, and her hat became a summer hat and then an argument with heat, and the boy with the scar took it upon himself to correct three men about the route change with a politeness that was so sharp it left them surprised they were bleeding.\n\nThey had a fight one night, and the fight was about nothing and also about the loop that anger can get into when it has no place to be placed. It began with a tie and the correct angle of a knot and moved with ruthless efficiency to the proper use of a word, and then Mason did the thing where he made a joke to keep the ceiling from falling and Jack refused to catch it because he wanted the ceiling to admit it had been creaking. They were careful not to be unkind because they were men who had learned unkindness spills and ruins the shoes you need for work, but they did raise their voices and then lower them because the building was old and had learned too many secrets already. It ended not with a kiss because they were stupid in exactly the proper way, but with a clementine, because idiocy should be fed and not taught to fight on an empty stomach. Jack peeled one half and handed it across the line they had drawn and Mason took it and said, \u201cWe need to write a rule about what happens when we both want to be the person who gets to be right,\u201d and Jack said, \u201cWe write two rules, and we change which one we use every other Thursday,\u201d and then they laughed because the sentence had rescued them, and then they touched the back of each other\u2019s wrists because touching wrists had become a religion they could practice without anyone outside reading their hymn book.\n\nWhen Mason\u2019s six months were up, the letter he sent to D.C. was not a resignation and not a recommitment. He wrote in a voice they had taught him to use, one that sounded as if he trusted the reader to be a person and not just a position. He said he wanted the work when it worked and wanted the river when it did not and that he refused to apologize for wanting both. He said he would keep his apartment and his space and his keys and that he would learn again the names of the three women who run the city and pretend the men do, because names are the most important currency in a town like theirs. He said he would go north when it served the work and south when the work demanded it and that no part of that sentence furnished anyone with permission to demand more. When he read it to Jack on the sofa that had finally learned the exact shape of their two bodies sitting at their favorite distance, Jack said, \u201cThis is honest enough to be impolite,\u201d and Mason said, \u201cThen it\u2019s useful,\u201d and they decided to mail it not because they believed in the mail but because they liked the weight of a thing landing on a desk without a chime.\n\nThe white dog was there the morning they found out the letter had been accepted, woofless as a benediction. Ms. Pettigrew called to say the boy had been hired to announce the stops on the summer rec bus because someone at Operations had a sense of humor and a respect for lunacy, and the boy came by to practice his voice with a solemnity that made him into a man for five minutes and then back into a child who had invented public transit. Jack\u2019s mother made sandwiches that were as ugly as sin and better for it and brought them in a bag as if she were a deliverer of mercy and not a woman who had taught herself the routes to the buildings she used to think were not for her. The mayor sent a text with a confetti emoji he misused in a way that made the confetti a truce and not a party, and Mr. Halloran\u2019s assistant sent a sentence that both congratulated them and reminded them the streetlight poles would not buy themselves.\n\nThey celebrated by not celebrating, because gratitude is easier for them when it looks like ordinary time. They walked by the mural where the women had learned to smirk in a way that frightened men into admiring them, and they got coffee so bad it tasted like nostalgia, and they argued about whether to replace the filing cabinet that stuck, and they did none of the grand things that television men think men do when the world gives them a portion of their own desire. In the office, the coin and the clementine sat next to each other like a joke they could always tell, and Jack said, \u201cProof,\u201d and Mason said, \u201cProof,\u201d and the building consented to be the kind of structure that held their weight without noticing it was doing so on purpose.",
