The night air hummed with heat as if the sun had forgotten its job and wedged itself under the city just to listen. High above the streaming ribbon of I-35, Tallulah perched on the concrete lip of an overpass, heels swinging, the sound of her feet tapping like distant thunder. A tanker roared by, horn blowing three useless notes, and she waved. Her shadow stretched quarter of a mile across a warehouse roof where the logo of a sports drink warped and buckled under her weight.

She tilted her head and spoke to no one, to the invisible machine that learned her voice, her vowels full of gravel: “Post it.”

A tone chimed, small against the enormity of her frame, and words marched across the screen of a phone she wore like a pendant, the case custom-made by a man who no longer returned her messages.

hello girls, she wrote. i see you, even when you think i don’t. your windows are too clean. your voices too loud. did you think i would just stop because someone asked nicely?

She paused and tasted the word girls, let it dissolve on her tongue like an old lozenge. Regret shifted inside her like a boulder rolling. It had edges. It had an alphabet. It spelled names she could never get rid of, no matter how she scrubbed: Jo, Mari, Lila. She rubbed her knuckles against her skull where the regret sometimes sat, the way you rub out a headache. It never moved.

The city murmured and kept moving. An airplane blinked its way into the cotton of cloud. There was rain up there, someday rain. Not tonight.

She pressed her palms down on the overpass to steady herself and felt, in the unlit nest of her chest, the uneven thrum of the engines below. Trucks, buses, the smear of small cars. She could feel everything when she paid attention. Gas station refrigerators. The zapping halos of street lamps. That old substation south of the river with a transformer that sang at a frequency you had to be lonely to hear. She listened.

“Stop me,” Tallulah whispered, to the highway and the world and the people who wouldn’t. “I dare you.”

The blog caught it all. Her followers—most of them anonymous, some of them convinced they were the main character in her story—read it in bed, on the toilet, in the warm vapors of the last logged-in office elevators. Some of them were the women she taunted, hate-reading as if hatred were a hot bath. Some were men who called her goddess from behind the shield of avatars. A few were reporters who used words like unprecedented and phenomenon and asked interview questions into the void.

hello girls, she continued, a second post. tonight i walked past your facades and left fingerprints. check your glass. you’ll see the smudges. if you want. (you won’t even look.)

She didn’t laugh. She rarely did. Laughter was too light for what she carried. Regret likes the lower registers.

On the other side of the Trinity, in a bungalow the color of old paper, Dr. Leticia Salgado paused with her hands inside an electrical panel and felt the city go taut. She had that, too—the sense of electrical weather, the weather of current and load and usage patterns that meant nothing to most people. She hadn’t gone to medical school, didn’t threaten infections with antibiotics or put her hands into a chest for a heartbeat, but the word Doctor stuck—PhD on a paper, a dissertation about inrush currents and harmonic resonance in unshielded systems. It was funny until it wasn’t.

“Doc?” Manny called from the kitchen, gently as if asking a wild thing to eat from his hand. “You want me to flip the main or leave it.”

“Leave it, por favor,” she said. Her voice came out thin. She bent closer to the shadows inside the box and breathed, counting as she always did. Six. No, seven felt safer. She drew back a tick, adjusted her headlamp up a notch, and tightened a neutral wire that had come loose and was flirting with trouble. The house sighed when she cinched it down.

Outside the open window, a freight train intoned a warning as it shouldered a crossing. In the low hallway, a fan turned and turned, moving warm air to where more warm air waited.

“Something wrong?” Manny leaned in the doorway and held a sweating glass.

Leticia kept her eyes on her work. “Tallulah posted again.”

Manny let out a breath that was almost a laugh. “She’s not my fairy tale. Don’t say her name.”

“If she’s a fairy tale,” Leticia said, clicking the panel shut, “you know how those go for women.”

Manny had a gift for turning his shoulders without moving much else. He did it then, the shrug of someone who carried bad news like groceries so often he’d found the way to haul it lightly. “I brought you that soda you hate.”

She took it and drank. She did hate it. It tasted like medicinal moonlight. It cut through the fatigue anyway and left a wake of small sparks on her tongue.

On the table in the front room, between two coils of wire and a brush for cleaning battery terminals, her laptop sat open to the blog with the bone-white background and the text that was somehow always too close. Tallulah didn’t sign her posts. She didn’t need to. The diction was its own signature, and the photographs—wide-angle, taken from heights impossible for cranes—made the city look toy-small. A fire escape wreathed in ivy like a bracelet. A crosswalk like a confession. She had posted at 2:03 a.m. the way she often did.

Leticia skimmed and stopped, skimmed and stopped, her brain snagging on certain phrases as if they had barbs. She reached for a pencil and wrote a note on the back of a receipt: south river substation. smudges? transformer c note. The page before that had other lists, other clues, all of them trying to make a map as if a map could hold someone like Tallulah.

“I’m going out,” she said.

“Doc.”

“I’ll call.” She didn’t add the liar’s kiss—promise. She slid the panel cover into place with more force than it took, put the cola down half-drunk, and shrugged into her denim jacket, a stupid piece of resistance against the heat. Her boots were by the door. She pulled them on.

Manny didn’t move to stop her. He never did, which was why he stayed.

The city altered its sound when she stepped outside. She lived for that moment, the shift from the small household hum to the cables of Dallas running overhead, underfoot. The latticework of grid and human intention, set down, redrawn, set down again. She climbed into her truck and turned the key. The dashboard lit up like a chorus of fireflies. She felt the need like something alive, pressing against her ribs. Stop her.

Tallulah had been in Dallas for six months. Or she had been seen for six months. Rumors said she came from oil fields, from a sorrow. Rumors said she had a sister who had lied to her. A lover who had left. A town that had mocked. Leticia did not indulge in rumors; she consumed signals. The grid told stories nobody else had patience for. Spikes. Dips. Load shedding during odd hours. That low transformer by the south river substation that had woken her up at three a.m. two nights running, humming a little too loud, as if it were trying to speak.

She drove toward the Trinity, the highway emptying and filling like a lung. On the radio a woman talked about hydration while a drummer forgot where the beat was, then found it again. The sky had begun to bruise—purple shading to pink—when she pulled into the empty lot by the dog park. The river was a glint. Prairie grass leaned with the breeze as far as the levee allowed.

On the concrete edge of the floodwall, white chalk spelled out words that someone had written and someone else had half-scrubbed: NO GIANTS. STAY HOME. TALLULAH = COWARD. The lines trailed away where rain or a shoe had smeared them. Leticia touched the chalk with her fingertip and came away with a ghost of the word giant on her skin.

She walked past the dog park fence and the sleeping water and sat on the massive block of limestone that someone had rolled there to look artistic. Her phone lit her face with that particular tired blue. Her browser history was a map of Tallulah’s arrival. The first posts, coy and cruel. The second month’s escalation. Photos with landmarks increasingly close. Then the taunts: i like the sweater. keep it folded. where you put it under your pillow it gets wrinkled. She had noticed details that should have been invisible. A child’s drawing hung with a magnet shaped like a peach. A calendar marked with a crown around the 15th. Women who read her posts and felt their throat deepen with fear. How did she know? How did she know that?

Leticia suspected the answer lay not in magic but in repetition. Watch a city long enough and it taught you its habits. Watch people long enough and you know where their keys sit the moment they walk in the door. It would be mundane if it wasn’t monstrous.

She found the substation. It sat a hunched block south of here, fenced and snarling like a caged thing in a yard it had chewed to dirt. She parked across the street and listened. The world had a chorus and this station sang a minor part, always. Tonight the hum had a wobble in it. Like grief. She grabbed her bag and climbed the chain-link.

“Hey!” A voice, high and cracking. She turned and saw a kid on a BMX bike, seen-everything face carefully turned to I don’t care. “You can’t go in there.”

“Then don’t follow me,” she said, which was a joke and then it wasn’t.

She dropped down inside the fence and crouched near the transformer. Metal heat breathed against her cheek. The hum vibrated through the bones of her jaw, the way low music does when you sit too close to the speaker. She closed her eyes and looked with her ears.

There. A beat like a skipped word. Another there. The wobble again. If she laid a stethoscope to the shell, she knew what she would hear: the mechanical heart of it trying to keep pace with demand while some external pressure tugged out of time. It was not failing. It was simply… correctively wrong. As if someone had draped a hand across it and was pressing gently against the song it wanted to sing.

Regret shifted inside her chest. Tallulah carried regret like a weapon. Leticia wore hers like a weight. She put her hands on the mesh that surrounded the nearest bus bar and listened again, for longer this time, careful to keep her fingers outside the forbidden. The hum deepened. It asked for nothing. It simply was. The kid on the bike had long ago pedaled away or figured out how to watch without being seen. Leticia, for once, was just one more nocturnal creature on the edge of a fenced field.

A text buzzed. Manny: you good. use words.

She typed: hum’s off. i’m at south sub.

He replied: no heroics.

She made a face at the screen, put the phone in her back pocket, and stood. No heroics was language people used when they wanted to pretend they’d absolved you. She was not a hero. She was a woman who knew how to make the lights go out without burning everything down, and even that knowledge felt like a sin. Still—the thought had been chewing at the joints of her skull for weeks. Tallulah wasn’t just big. Tallulah was tuned. She could feel the grid. She took the city’s electricity into her own organ system and fed it back in waves. If Leticia was right, it meant Tallulah could be interrupted. Not hurt, not like that. But disrupted? Maybe.

“Stop me,” Tallulah had written. “I dare you.”

“Not a dare,” Leticia said, to the transformer, to her own stupid bravery. She hopped the fence back into a world that made more sense to other people, and went home before sunrise caught her gaping like a tourist. She did not sleep.

When the morning news ran its segments—traffic, temperatures, sports scores that had already curdled in the small hours—an anchor with hair like a helmet cleared her throat and said: “She has updated her blog again.” They showed the same photograph of Tallulah that they always did: grainy, massive, an outline against the skyline, the pixelated hint of a mouth that could have been a smile if you were foolish. The anchor read the newest post aloud as if reading it could drain it of power. hello girls. thank you for your attention. i will be in deep ellum for coffee later. see you? there was no winking emoji. There never was.

Women cancelled meetings. They texted one another in small, fast bursts: don’t go that way. come up cole instead. i can pick you up. i can come inside with you. Men offered solutions like helmets. The police were present but curiously far away. The mayor elected not to say her name on camera anymore.

Tallulah walked to Deep Ellum at ten minutes after nine, the hour when late coffee meets early beer. She moved with a slowness that had learned patience. The rain-insistent clouds from last night washed out to a color like old denim, and the sun threw light at her like a dare. She took the sidewalk in sections, step by step, her strides careful not to buckle them, though she could have. She could have done a hundred cruel things with the casual ease of a yawn. She did not. Cruelty was more precise than that.

She peered in windows. People ducked. She peered into a glass door with a painting of a wolf on it. Standing very still, she put her fingertip—bigger than a loaf of bread—on the glass and drew a loop. On the inside, the barista cried and then wiped the mark away with a towel that smelled like bleach.

Tallulah felt the mark in her bones. She felt every mark she made, as if making it etched it onto her. That was the trouble and the fuel. She had left so many marks that the weight of them had remade her body. She had to keep going to bear what she had already done. That was the logic she had built herself in. It didn’t matter how many times she tried to tear it down. She would stare at herself in reflective glass and whisper, bad math, bad math, but still the answer came out the same.

Her phone chimed. She tilted her head and looked at the screen where a comment bubbled up under her latest entry. The avatar was a cartoon fox. The content was the usual mix of thirst and terror.

why women? the fox asked. why us? what did we do to you.

Tallulah didn’t type for a long time. Her hands were useful for other things. She spoke. “Because.”

The software transcribed her voice like a prayer. Because you wouldn’t let me forget.

She stared at the sentence until the words lost meaning. Then she put the phone to her chest, right over the place where her heart fought an old battle. She would delete that later, she thought. She did not.

Leticia spent the morning with a woman named Ruth, who had a neat kitchen and a breaker panel that kept flipping its middle finger. She worked without talking much. Ruth tried to fill the silence, in the way people feel compelled to fill things, with oat cookies and the implacable report of her grandchildren, one of whom had a Lego stuck inside the radiator so deep that Ruth could hear it ticking when the heat was on, the way one hears a clock when one is alone.

“I’ve got girls,” Ruth said, then corrected, “women. I mean—grown. But I say girls because I have said girls their whole lives.”

Leticia tightened a thread of copper like she was threading a needle. “My mother still calls me m’ija when she wants me to be brave, and doctor when she wants me to be careful.”

Ruth smiled and failed to stop the worry from dragging her mouth downward. “She’s out there right now, you know.”

“I know,” Leticia said. “I know.”

“I read the posts when my daughters are not here. Stupid. I shouldn’t.”

“We all do stupid things. It’s a way to test the weight. Of the world. Of your own hands.”

Ruth nodded like that meant something. Maybe it did. Leticia wanted, suddenly, to tilt her face into the sun like a plant. She finished the work and wrote a receipt. The panel settled into a low contented purr, like something fed. Ruth insisted on paying her in cash and tomatoes, the first of the season, fat and slick-skinned, red like cartoon hearts.

When she left, the air outside felt like a hand against her mouth. The heat had arrived with its usual intention. “You gonna boil alive if you stay,” Manny had said once. “You gonna die of a different thing if you go,” she had replied, and they had had a toast to stubbornness.

Her phone buzzed. A notification. Not the blog, though her body responded as if it were. Her mother’s face lit the display, her hair a riotous crown of gray. Leticia answered.

“Mamá.”

“You eat?”

“Yes.”

“A sandwich is not eating. I can see it on your face. You look like you had an argument with a light bulb.”

“I had an argument with a transformer,” Leticia said.

“Even worse.”

They talked about bread. About a plant the neighbor had put too near the fence. About a man from church who had shrugged when asked to help and then, when the pastor used the word stewardship, volunteered to carry a cross in the procession and almost tripped. Her mother’s voice smoothed something in Leticia that had been rough all morning. Then the pause. The inhale nobody wanted.

“You see the woman.”

“Tallulah.”

“Don’t say her name,” her mother said, in the same tone Manny had used without knowing. “You watch your step. You don’t fix everything. God did not give you those small hands to fix a giant. That’s not what they’re for.”

“What are they for?” Leticia asked. It sounded like a plea. It annoyed her.

“For wiring,” her mother said matter-of-fact. “For making a life. For taking care of Manny because nobody else will. For cooking my eggs when I am to old to cook them myself.”

Leticia smiled despite herself. “Those are specific.”

“Specific is how we live. General is for politicians,” her mother replied, then softened. “Just be careful, m’ija.”

After the call, after the tomatoes rolled on the passenger seat like hearts with bad balance, after she drove back toward the warehouse where Manny was stripping conduit like a man peeling oranges—after all of that, the blog pinged again. She pulled into a shady spot under the burping grease of a taqueria’s vent and read.

you like coffee. i saw you yesterday. navy jacket, hair messy. you looked tired and important. i wanted to tell you to sleep.

It was addressed to no one. To everyone. But it felt, for the length of a heartbeat, like it looked straight at Leticia. The description could have been a hundred women. A thousand. It was what Tallulah did—cast nets. But the phrasing rubbed against her skin. Hair messy. Sleep.

She typed, her fingers walking the keys without permission: stop.

She didn’t send it. She never sent anything. She never engaged. She shut the app, opened it again, shut it like a door with too much memory in it.

That evening, Tallulah climbed onto the roof of a shopping center where once a department store had anchored a mall that later became a church meets entertainment concept and then became empty again, dead in a new way. She sat there and watched the horizon become long and low. She watched people. She watched the wind make a noise in a stand of trees that had been allowed to grow old. She made another post.

you will not forget me, she wrote. it’s funny. all my life i tried to be easy to forget. i was quiet. i was softer than i wanted to be. and now look.

A comment zipped up under it, immediate as a reflex. A woman named J. with a blossom as her avatar typed: i remember everything. i remember too much. we do not need your help to remember. go away. we were fine.

Tallulah read it three times. The word fine shifted color each time, a chameleon pretending to be a jewel. She almost answered. She almost wrote and wrote. She put the phone down and crushed an air conditioning unit into a silver accordion and pretended it wasn’t because her hands hurt.

Leticia, in the warehouse, stood on a ladder and installed a new run. Manny held the light. He didn’t talk. That was his gift to her: an evening where he only existed to be there. They worked until the power came through steady as a pulse. She stepped down. They ate tacos in the truck. Manny finally said, around a mouthful, “You think you could interrupt her. That thing you’re thinking. You will try.”

Leticia took a breath with edges. “I can’t let her be the only one. Making choices for us. Even if what I do is small.”

“You want me to tell you not to. I can say the words.”

“I want you to promise to stand back if I do. You can say those words.”

He sank the rest of the taco in one bite and wiped his mouth with the paper. “Okay. I will stand back. I will hold the light. They will say I should have stopped you. I will nod and say yes. But I will hold the light.”

She put her head against the steering wheel for a second, the horn a silent dare under her forehead. She breathed. She didn’t cry. Mostly.

That night, the city stretched itself around its people like an old sweater and tried to comfort the ones who weren’t built for comfort. Leticia drew diagrams on graph paper with dull pencils. She made a list of parts she could afford. She looked at the map of substations, at the spine of the grid. She ate one of Ruth’s tomatoes over the sink and let the tap run cold then warm and then cold again, wasting water she would feel bad about when she woke up.

Tallulah wrote herself into a corner. hello girls. what’s your favorite seat at the movies. left side or right. front or back. She didn’t know why she asked. She hadn’t been inside a cinema since she had become too big to fit anywhere. She missed the human-sized seats, the little indignities and comforts of smallness. She missed folding herself into a space and being contained. There was no containing anything now. That day had burned itself out in a long scream she had translated into size. People gave her commas in their sentences. They put her on their tongues like pepper. They wrote her into their little lives. And she took that. And gave back what she had.

Sometime between two and three in the morning, when the night belongs to whatever animal in you can see it, Leticia fell asleep on her couch, pen in her hand like a weapon that might consent to be a tool. She dreamed—in those fragments that break apart when sunlight touches them—of wires that were also rivers and a face she could not see because it was made of reflective glass. She dreamed of whispers. She dreamed of her own hands, bigger than they were, too big to do delicate work, pawing at circuit boards and breaking them, breaking them.

She woke with the dirty taste of panic in her throat. In the room, the fan rotated and rotated and remembered to come back to each side. She reached for her phone. A headline glared at her. Not blood. Not yet. God. not yet.

Woman claims Tallulah left message on her window, it read. Protecting our city’s most vulnerable. Another article leaned on the word rampage as if leaning hard enough would make a narrative.

Leticia opened the blog, and there it was. The most recent post, one line only:

dress rehearsal. who’s coming.

She stared until the words turned into dust. She felt her heart punch the inside of her ribs. She thought of her mother stirring eggs slowly in a pan. She thought of Manny’s hands steady on a ladder. She thought of the hum at the substation and the wobble in it, like breath hitching in a throat. She thought of all the women who lived with a hand always almost on their mouths.

She got up and washed her face. She put on her jacket. She stopped long enough to text Manny: today. i need the truck. i need the big spool.

The reply came fast, like he had been waiting with the sentence in his fingers. ok. i’ll hold the light.

Tallulah watched the sunrise from the parking lot of a supermarket where the automatic doors sighed open for nobody. She watched because watching had always felt like a kind of participation. As a girl, she had watched and felt herself part of things she was not in. Now she could stand in the middle of any event and be considered outside of it. People talked around her like she was an anomaly to be integrated into their story later, after they were sure their own narrative arc could carry the weight.

She thought of the first time she had said the wrong thing to the wrong woman. She had been nineteen and had turned the sharpness she wore on herself outward because it felt easier. She had told a friend, a better friend than she deserved, a thing that had peeled the skin right off. There was no apology that fit the damage. That friend had left. She had left and left and left. The leaving had echoed and turned into a hallway. Tallulah had walked it and never found the door to a room where she could rest. Years later, she had grown. She had grown past the limits of what her own body could bear. She had grown to fit the shape the regret had cut out of her. This was not a story. Stories have shapes you can anticipate. This was a road with no guardrail and she put everyone else on it when she felt like it.

She checked her blog again, ran her thumb over the screen like the glass was a face she could touch. Comments piled up. They always did, a tower of small voices, some brave, some mean. A woman named L. wrote: go away. leave us. leave me. i’m tired. please. A man calling himself K1ng typed: come to my place, goddess. i can handle you. She ignored both, and all the ones that read like mirrors held at angles.

Her fingers drummed a rhythm against the side of the building. Distant, electricity collected itself in its great lung and inhaled.

When the heat of the day took its first step, when the morning announced itself with the same turquoise sky as always, Leticia and Manny loaded the truck. The spool. The portable capacitor bank that had cost her more than she would admit, purchased three towns over from a man who had asked no questions because he had learned the economy of no. Coils of cable that held enough promise to make her hands shake. A toolbox with the usual, and something she had built that she had not even named because names are for things you want to keep.

“You sure,” Manny said, not even a question.

“Ask me again when it’s done,” she said.

They drove to the edge of an industry park where the concrete had cracked in a pattern that reminded her of the diagrams she had once used to explain nonlinear systems to rooms full of students with the eyes of owls. They set up where nobody would look. They listened for the faraway. They listened for her.

“She’ll be at the river again,” Manny said. “She likes the sound.”

“She likes to feel herself in the sound,” Leticia corrected, and hated herself for the intimacy of that insight.

They waited. They watched the clouds pretend not to notice that they were being watched. The city tried to go about its business, the way a person does when they’ve been told to ignore the rock in their shoe because it will teach them grit. Traffic pouted and moved again. Air-conditioners bragged about their abilities. The hum in the substation changed pitch. The spine of current adjusted.

Leticia closed her eyes and felt the trill through the soles of her boots. There. The wobble again. She nodded once, to herself, like a gambler who knows the next card will hurt. She picked up the coil of cable and the not-named device and breathed in seven counts and out seven counts and then didn’t count at all.

“Hold the light,” she told Manny.

He held it up, that silly battery lantern he always bought on sale and declared the best, the best. He held it like a promise. He held it like a benediction.

Leticia walked into the hum.Heat made the air thick enough to move aside with a shoulder, so Leticia moved through it as if someone might see the hole she left behind and tell her to come back. The hum met her before the fence did, a body of sound you could wade into until the current slicked your skin with attention. She set the case down on cracked asphalt and opened it with a click that felt foolishly loud, as if sound could draw lightning, then told herself that if lightning was coming, it already knew her name. Manny stayed where she had told him, on the other side of the painted line they had agreed meant safe, the lantern lifting his forearms into a soft halo like he was blessing the mess they were making. She unspooled cable, the copper shining like a vein caught in light, and ran it low along the ground the way you do a rope you trust but know can burn you. The device she had not named felt wrong in her hands and then, without warning, felt exactly like something she had been preparing for since before she knew what to call the parts of things.

The fence was not a fence so much as a suggestion. She went through where the chain-link had learned to sag; she had brought cutters but did not need them, because the world did not always insist you struggle to break it open. The substation breathed. Transformers hunched with a patience that felt older than the city, and the bus bars gleamed with that numb brightness metals have when they carry more than they let on. She found the coupling point she had mapped with a pencil and a prayer, a place where she could tuck her signal in like a secret without the system spitting it back out with contempt. She tightened a clamp and counted under her breath in a language she only used when she wanted to ask a machine to behave. Then she stepped back into the open, because you do not stand under a fist you are about to bump.

The plan was simple in the way storms are simple if you draw them on a whiteboard. The bank would charge, the coils would talk to the lines without touching them, and what she sent would not be power but the suggestion of a rhythm that was almost, but not quite, the rhythm the grid already loved. Not a blow. Not a cut. An invitation to stumble, one beat off, a syncopation that would make a dancer who had learned only straight-time hesitate. She had tested it in small, safe places on nights when the city slept like it trusted her, and no one had noticed the old streetlights on Thompson blink a pattern that was not a mistake. Tonight, if it worked, one person would notice and hate her for it or thank her for it or both at the same time, and Leticia could not afford to want either.

Across town, Tallulah felt the breath change. She had been sitting on the canted roof of a box store with its signage peeled away like old skin, watching a woman unlock a door twice and then stand inside the threshold, undecided. The woman’s hair was the color of money in some countries. Tallulah meant to say something into the pendant she wore, a nothing-post that ants would find and swarm, a little salt for the faithful. The word did not arrive. There was, instead, a tickling at the bottom of the notes she kept in her ribs, like a burr winking against fabric. She lifted her head and rolled her shoulders, the shoulder-roll of someone whose body is the tool and the wound both. The grid sang its millions of voices, the chorus of air conditioners and cash registers and hospital machines and aquarium filters, but underneath that was a second thought, thin and insistent, like a second person in a room clearing their throat.

She knew the city the way you know a house you have lived in too long. You can walk to the bathroom in the dark without stubbing your toes but you still notice when a chair is moved half an inch. This was more than a chair. Heat struck the side of her face where the sunrise had begun to try again, but the itch came from the other direction, from a place that did not exist in ordinary maps. She closed her eyes and let herself go very still, the way she did when she wanted to count how many men were in a building by the flavors of their nicotine, and the way the elevator climbed told her which one would get off where. The itch resolved into a rhythm. It was not rude. It was not loud. It was stubborn, and that was worse.

Leticia had to time it on the exhale or it felt like disrespect. She watched the needles move. She watched the software pretend not to be afraid of what she was asking it to do. Then she lifted a hand and lowered it, the way a conductor signals nothing and everything at once, and the system took her offer. The first wave went out like a question asked by a careful person who knows they are not owed an answer. The second held itself together by memory of the first and her refusal to take her hand off the dials until she had learned what she could learn and failed to ruin anything she could not fix. The wobble she had heard last night turned toward her, curious as a dog, and she felt the back of her knees go soft in relief at the simple fact of something behaving in the pattern she had anticipated.

“What do you hear?” Manny asked, not because he needed to know but because if his voice occupied the space where fear wanted to sit, fear might have to go wait in the hall.

Leticia kept her eyes on the numbers even as she listened with the parts of herself she trusted more. “Less air,” she said. “Like the room agreed to be smaller for a second. Like she—like the thing that listens—has to bend to hear it. It’s working but I don’t know if working means what we want.”

Manny shifted his weight and made no other sound. The lantern hummed its own small ambition. The sky over the warehouses had the color of a bruise you only notice when you press it. Somewhere a forklift protested the indignity of being told no.

The second wave reached Tallulah in the narrow place under her collarbone where once a piano teacher had placed a blunt hand and told her that breath is a hinge. The tickle became an insistence, and she felt her left foot catch on nothing as she stood, as if the air had erected a curb to make her feel ridiculous. She straightened because straightening is what you do when you fall and no one sees. The hum she had worn like a scarf for months shifted down in key, not by much, but enough that she had to change the way she was wearing it. She frowned. She frowned at the roof, at the woman with two locks, at a cloud that had the gall to do nothing special while the world dared her in a new accent.

She lifted the pendant phone, that ridiculous jewel, and spoke because words have always let her believe she was the one arranging them. “Is that you?” she asked, not to her followers but to the thing that was playing with her. The software did not know what to do with that and turned it into a draft that hung under her last post like a rag.

The city registered the adjustment the way a body registers a pill. Somewhere a compressor ran cooler than it ought and liked it. Somewhere a man thought the hair on his arm stood up because he had imagined seeing his ex-wife three times in a row, once in a passing car, once in the reflection on a deli case, once in a woman with a different walk who had nothing to do with him. The dog whose shape was made of muscles and forgiveness tipped its head and could not parse why the ceiling fan was now interesting. Ruth, in her kitchen with the panel tamed, found that her radio station had acquired a whisper at the edge of its broadcast and twiddled the dial, annoyed with the weather.

Leticia kept the wave narrow and small, like she was sewing and afraid of tearing anything. She thought of her mother’s eggs, how the heat should be low and the stirring should be patient. Her fingers made micro-adjustments she had not rehearsed. It was not music, not really, but it used the part of her that listened when music happened. She took the wobble she had heard and offered it a partner that would make it trip. Tallulah tripped. Not by much. Not even enough for anyone to see if they were not already looking at nothing more than the posture of a figure too far away to try to name. But Tallulah felt it like the ground had mispronounced her and decided she needed to go hear that mistake from the mouth that made it.

When you are as big as a story, the city cannot stop you from going where you choose, but it throws up formal objections because it likes to keep a record. Tallulah walked as if she refused to disturb ants on a sidewalk and then crushed a stoplight with her hip because the stoplight asked for it by being something that belonged to other people. Drivers cursed in their cars without knowing why their mouths had made that shape. A woman on a bus saw the great body pass like a slow sea creature and put her hand on the shoulder of the man asleep beside her, and when he startled she said, “Sorry,” because apology is a reflex like blinking. On the blog, because she had trained herself to feed it when she fed herself, she tapped out a line that read, in its graceless lower-case, that she would be downtown where the river folded into the spine of the city, that if you had something to say you should say it now. She did not add a threat. She had learned that implied was sharper than explicit.

Leticia felt the direction change before the phone vibrated where she had left it face-down in the dust next to the case. She watched the numbers lift like birds and settle again and knew that the mass on the other end of the hum was making a choice in her direction. It was a clean feeling and a terrible one. She turned the dial a hair and heard the line lower into an ache she had named in her notes because to name things is to think you understand them. The device got warm. The bank complained in a polite way. She ran the back of her wrist along her temple and left a streak of grime across a face she would not bind to any one expression until she knew whether joy or fear was going to win.

“Time to go?” Manny asked, a question he meant in four different ways.

“Time to hold,” she said. “Please hold. Please just hold.” She knew she was talking to everything—the capacitor, Manny’s spine, the part of herself that loved risk as an algebra problem, the city which would forgive her if she failed only if she did not hurt babies or saints.

Tallulah cut south, then back east, because the rhythm said east and her feet respected it. The world adjusted around her like a quilt dragged by a child crossing a room, corners snagging, then freeing. She passed the old substation and felt the transformer that had sung loneliness to her for a week suddenly hum in a voice that was not alone. She hissed, a stupid snake sound that meant only that if she could bite this feeling it would be easier. She looked up, expecting to see a person on a ladder with a megaphone, because some part of the mind refuses magic until it can draw a circuit around it. There was no ladder. There was no megaphone. There was only the new insistence asking her in a language of voltage to attend.

Leticia felt her arrive before she smelled the dust she threw up coming down an access road no truck had taken in months. It came as a pressure first, then as a change in the phase lag the way a weight on a trampoline makes your body find a new center or risk showing everyone who is watching that you do not know where your feet live. Manny saw her and did not say it aloud because the saying would turn the sight into something that might behave differently. His hands remembered that he had learned to pray late in life with a resentment that had softened only because sometimes words keep you from being nothing but a bruise. He did not pray now. He tightened the grip on the lantern and lifted it higher because he needed to do something that did not pretend to own the outcome.

For a strange breathing stretch of time, the giant and the woman looked at one another as if a jar had been placed on a table and someone had asked both to describe its shape without touching it. Tallulah was taller than a thought and smaller than myth, her hair bound back in a rope that remembered hands that had made it, her face cut with sun and sleeplessness. Leticia was as she had always been, a collection of bones with a purpose, a mouth that had chosen not to soften certain truths with sugar. The air between them was full of everything that comes between a person who can ruin you and a person who believes she can fix something she did not break.

“Hello,” Tallulah said, and the word had to cross so much empty that by the time it reached Leticia it had become a thing you might put down and take apart to see where the kindness was hiding. “This your song?”

Leticia lifted her chin because a dropped chin is a concession. She wanted to say, Not a song, a lever, but this woman did not need metaphors that made everything polite. “It’s me,” she said, and gestured with the hand that did not belong on any switch. “I asked the city to hum at you a way you don’t like. It seems to be working.”

Tallulah smiled the way you smile at children when you want them to think they have tricked you. The smile did not go to her eyes because her eyes had been busy elsewhere. “Why.” It was not a question seeking reasons so much as it was a test of what the other person thought reasons were worth.

“Because you said to stop you and because you are using a system that keeps people alive to make yourself a story,” Leticia said. She had rehearsed three versions of that sentence, two shorter and one complicated enough to walk with a limp. The plain one arrived instead. “Because I can create discomfort without building a grave. Because perhaps if you stumble you’ll pick a different direction.”

“You think you can steer me,” Tallulah said, and for a second the light in her face was actual amusement, a relief like cold water.

“No,” Leticia said. “I think I can make you choose. It might be worse, your choice. It might be kinder. But it will be yours, not just the automatic consequence of a pain you keep translating into other people’s fear.”

The word pain did something predictable and unforgivable. Tallulah’s shoulders lifted, and for a second her hands curled as if they would like to tear the air conditioner off a roof to hear the metal cry again. She hated pity. She had loved pity once because it meant someone had seen her in the corner where she had been hiding, and then she had learned the version of it that turns a person into a cautionary tale. She set her jaw and pretended the word had rolled off her like rain off tar. “What do you want me to do? Sit quietly in a river, let carp swim between my toes, and write a repentance essay? It would get so many clicks, doctora.”

“Do not call me that to be cruel,” Leticia said, and the don’t had a music from somewhere she had not consented to visit today. “You want me to say go away. I am going to say something uglier. I want you to feel your size and make a decision that doesn’t use women to measure if you exist.”

The silence that followed had a weight made of wires. Manny found he had breathed in and forgotten how to let it out until the lantern shifted in his hands and reminded him he was not a statue. Leticia reached without looking and adjusted the dial a tick, and the hum changed in the smallest way, just enough that Tallulah had to lift her head like a deer made of power. Discomfort traveled through her body, a minor-key chord adding itself to her sternum where regret had learned all the shapes of sitting. For one breath, everything that had propped her up went quiet, and in that quiet she heard herself as a human might hear the ocean when they are far inland and have always pretended not to care about the sea.

“You can’t hold it,” Tallulah said finally, and there was admiration in that, or maybe she was only reporting the weather. “You can’t hold me. You can make a crease in the paper and call it a break and people will applause because they love seeing a circus they say they do not approve.”

“I can’t hold you,” Leticia agreed. “I can make it not feel good to do what you are doing. I can keep making it not feel good. I can make a kind of password between you and the pleasure you think you get from posting the sentence that ruins somebody’s afternoon. If you want to do it anyway, fine. But it will be like eating chalk instead of candy.”

“You sound like my tia when she tried to get me to quit soda,” Tallulah said, and this time when her mouth twisted it was almost honest. She glanced down at the little golden box, at the copper like spilled sunlight, at Manny with his absurd light pinning a circle on an afternoon that did not require candles. “And if I knock, this over? If I step and your work becomes a story too? What then.”

“Then I have a failure I can name,” Leticia said. “You want to break the light because it is telling you to see yourself. I want to hold the light on your hands. We’re both insulting each other the only way we know. You will be yourself whether I succeed or not. But maybe I can make it so that being yourself does not compel you to touch every girl who looks like someone you used to be.”

There it was, the sentence neither of them had wanted to put down between them like a hot pan nobody owned a mitt for. Tallulah flinched from it like anyone would, then stepped toward it because stepping away felt like letting someone else assign meaning to her feet. The rhythm beat against her ankles and her teeth and she saw for a second that this was not personal the way she wanted it to be. It was just a wave, indifferent, asking if she would put her body into it and call it a message.

“You think I do not know I am cruel,” she said. “You think I have not counted the uses, the coins and the rot. Do you think standing here and letting you make me itch counts as your righteousness? They will write songs about you, little doctor, and they will make you a patron saint of wiring and they will forget you when the story breaks a new toy.”

“I would like them to forget me,” Leticia said, and discovered that it was true enough to taste. “I do not need you to admit anything to me. I need you to know that someone is paying attention in a way that narrows your choices. If this does nothing but make you angry and send you somewhere else, that will still be something I took from you. Anger instead of joy. Placeholder instead of purpose.”

The wind came up and moved hot air from one patch of baked ground to another like it mattered. Manny felt sweat crawl in an old path down his spine and thought, unbidden, of a day years ago when he had stood in a parking lot waiting to be told he would not be fired, and the not-firing had felt so much like firing that he had laughed in the wrong place. He did not say anything now because anything he said would make him part of a confrontation he had not deserved and could not win. He watched the numbers on the screen because numbers tell the truth until they don’t.

Tallulah bent, because she could, and in bending made a wind that pushed dust toward the case and into all the places dust is always looking to live. Her face was a geography lesson, lines and ridges that had as much to do with weather as with time. She did not reach, because some habits had learned their limits. She set her elbow on a roof that had not asked to be a table and rest her chin on her knuckles and looked at the woman making the itch and became, for a handful of breaths, a person who could sit still.

“You could ask me to help you pull down a tree,” she said finally. “You could decide to be my friend. Is that not what women are supposed to do when the world asks us to hold each other’s hair back while we vomit? You could tell me you know my three secret names because you saw them in a list you keep like a garden you will water when you have the energy to be tender.”

“I could,” Leticia said. “I am choosing not to be your friend. You do not want a friend. You want a witness and a mirror, and I am too old and too tired and too small to be either, but I can be a metronome you hate. I can be a thing you avoid because being near it makes it hard to tell yourself the story ends the way you say it does.”

A noise built that had nothing to do with either of them. Sirens will come to any party if you borrow enough of the city to justify their attendance. The sound took the long path along the emergency lanes that were only visible when you wanted to find them. Manny turned his head toward it because you cannot help but look at the door when you hear someone coming up the stairs. Tallulah did not move. The itch in her bones had become a push she had to lean against to stay upright in the shape she had assigned herself. It would be so easy to put her foot down where the case was and crush the copper into art. She could do it. It would feel good the way breaking a glass feels good if you pretend you only did it by accident.

Instead she laughed, and anyone who heard the laugh would have said later that what it sounded like was tires on wet road, that thready slap that means everything is about to be harder and you should slow down. “Dress rehearsal,” she said, and somehow managed to make it both threat and mercy. “No show today. Let the city write a headline about your courage. I will read it and take what I need from it and leave my smudges where I choose.”

Leticia kept her hand on the dial because if she let go here the device might leap like a horse and bite her out of spite. “I don’t need headlines,” she said. “I need you to know that the hum will not love you back unconditionally. That is all.”

“That is nothing,” Tallulah said, but her mouth twitched around the edges as if nothing had surprised her by being something. She stood, careful not to shove the building with her knee, and the relief that moved through the metal around them traveled into Leticia’s ear as a sigh. For a second, because the brain cannot keep its own leash, they regarded one another as two people would in a grocery aisle when both reach for the same canned tomatoes and neither wants to be the one to make a joke. “Tell your man with the lamp to get a better one,” she said. “He looks like a saint in a cheap painting and it will not do.”

Manny snorted before he remembered not to. The sound broke the glass on a moment and let them all breathe the same air. The sirens were closer. The rhythm Leticia had made kept running because it was simpler to let it decay on its own than to pull the plug and invite a swing-back. She thought of saying more, the greedy last sentence that confuses closure with victory. She did not say it. She felt the edges of regret rise and set and held still long enough to see them turn into something like patience.

Tallulah walked away as if she were doing everyone a favor. The itch faded step by step and left behind a clean ache that did not belong to anyone else’s voice. If she had turned to crush the case, the story would have become uninteresting in a new way, and she was not ready to make it uninteresting. She would save that for when she needed to prove that she did not need any of them to hate her to feel alive. For now she wanted to remember what it felt like to be forced to listen to nothing. There was a kind of peace in contempt. She filed it away under reasons not to sleep.

Leticia kept the dial where it was until the numbers folded into themselves like tired birds settling in a hedge. She threw the switch when her hands stopped vibrating, and the device made a sound that could have been relief or could have been a warning she would refuse to hear until it was too late. She did not realize she was shaking until Manny put the lantern down and touched her arm, thumb at the elbow where you can calm a person if they are a horse or your cousin who has just confessed to a kind of almost-robbery.

“Okay,” he said, and then, because the word was insufficient to hold what needed holding, he added, “You did a thing. Now you breathe. Now you drink water that has been in the same room as ice. Now you eat something red. Now you tell me if what we do next needs more money or only more nerve.”

She laughed, a sawed-off noise that had no business being called that, and then found that the knotted place in her throat had to choose between laughter and something softer and picked the one that would not leave her eyes messy. “I need a nap,” she said. “I need glue. I need a better clamp. I need a city with a smaller spine.”

“You get one and a half of those,” Manny said, because reality is the rudest friend, and squeezed her elbow once more before stepping back into the person he was before he had agreed to be part of this.

They moved fast because sirens demand it and because the heat sat there with its mouth open ready to take anything left out. The case clicked closed with the confident sound of a lie. The spool felt heavier going back into the truck because hope is heavier than copper and hope had ridden out with it even if Leticia had pretended otherwise. She took one last listen to the hum for the sort of melancholy that tells you something has been lost and gained and you will count both as you fall asleep. Then she climbed into the cab and put her forehead on the steering wheel the way the pious put theirs on altar rails and said under her breath the seven-count she had inherited from a grandmother who had never fixed anything electrical and yet had taught her the only math that mattered.

By afternoon the story had mutated the way stories do when they leave the mouths they were made for. The local station found the angle where Leticia was a villain, then abandoned it because it did not taste good and no one ordered it. A national site wrote a paragraph that could have been plugged into any event and changed only the proper nouns. The blog swelled with comments from accounts whose histories were eggshells and ketchup. Anonymous defenders called Tallulah brave for not stepping on the little woman and anonymous prosecutors accused her of cowardice for not finishing the job they had invented for her. Ruth sent a message with a photo of a tomato sliced open to show its heart, and the text read I made salsa. It is too spicy. I will bring it anyway. Leticia put the phone face-down and looked at the ceiling until the fan’s rotation reassured her that repetition can be a kindness.

That evening the transformer by the river hummed true and did not wobble once. Leticia stood on the bike-scuffed dirt and listened with a pleasure she would not have dignified by calling joy. The kid on the BMX circled her at a cautious radius and said nothing because he had learned that you can be part of a thing by being quiet near it. The chalk on the floodwall had been scrubbed to a smear that looked like fog had tried to write a poem and failed. As the light softened, the city laid itself down around its women with a shoddy tenderness, and most of them slept because sleep is not a compliment from the world but an act of defiance you perform with your eyes closed.

On the roof of a warehouse that had kept a secret from its owner for years, Tallulah lay on her back and wondered what it would be like not to feel the hum. She did not miss small stadium seats or crappy armrests in old theaters as acutely as she had told herself. She missed not being the horizon line in other people’s photographs. She missed being able to say sorry without the sorry turning into a road. The itch was gone. In its place was a memory of it she could pull out and examine the way a person touches a scar to see if it still tells a story. She rolled to her side and spoke to the phone she had learned to hate and love like a sibling.

“hello girls,” she said, and the machine transcribed the lowercase like it had been paid to be respectful. “today i met someone who thinks the city can sing the right song at me. i let her do it. she will try again. i am making coffee with a pan because the machine is too small. have you ever thought about the way water and heat negotiate. i am thinking about it now.” She thought about deleting the whole thing because it was not knives. She posted it because some knives are made of kitchen light.

The comments came, fast and thirsty, as if thirst itself had learned to type. Some women wrote the words do not and then could not finish a sentence they had started ten years ago. Some men wrote recipes because recipes are another way to tell a person how to live. One account with a photograph of a train wrote nothing but a string of notes, letters masquerading as music. Tallulah read until the letters went soft. She put the phone down and closed her eyes and pictured the woman with small hands standing inside a station you were not supposed to enter and liked her for a breath, the sort of liking that arrives without asking and leaves before you can decide whether to take it inside.

Late, the city remembered rain. It tried, as it always did, to turn its attempt into a spectacle and then compromised with a spatter that slicked dust down and made steam from patches of sidewalk like the ground had chosen to be dramatic in small ways. Leticia stood on her porch and watched the drops hit the sill and thought about the device waiting in the truck like a dog you could not keep if it bit. She wanted to write an email to an old colleague with the subject line: you would not believe the application, and then remembered that there was no way to explain this without telling the parts she had promised herself she would not tell. She texted Manny a single word that somehow did not betray the promise she had made not to do one-sentence lines of thinking. She typed gracias and then, because the line felt thin, added for the light.

He responded with the photograph of an ugly flashlight and a message that read i ordered six more. if i die poor let it be because of batteries. She laughed and let herself have it this time, the laugh, because it did not threaten to break anything. She went inside and ate Ruth’s too-spicy salsa and thought about building a second bank with parts that would not arrive in time. Then, because sleep is a compromise she had to make with herself, she lay down on the couch she was not going to keep if this went where it was going, and closed her eyes on a city that does not stay fixed for anyone.

At two in the morning, far across the way near the fed-ex distribution center that had once been a field of sunflowers, Tallulah stood in the dark and put both palms on the roof of a car that had been parked under a sick tree. She listened to the ring in her hands that had always been hers, and under it she heard a memory of the day she had locked herself in a bathroom at nineteen and told the mirror no until the word wore out. The itch was not coming back tonight. She considered posting the photograph of her handprints on the dusty hood. She did not. She went home to wherever she went when she wanted to pretend she had a home, and the city, which had never promised to be gentle, kept its promise to be itself with a stubbornness that comforted nobody and everyone at the same time.By morning the heat had sorted itself into grades, like sand in a sieve, the finer grit slipping through to line everything that had a breath. The city woke up with the taste of tin on its tongue and did not ask why. Women kept their bags near and their keys in fists inside them and practiced control in a hundred gestures no one would film; men rearranged their posture to suggest readiness without admitting fear; children performed the miracle of forgetting between breakfast and the door. The hum steadied. The wobble that had made the night feel like a mouth trying to form a word it didn’t quite know faded into the same old vowels. But it lived in those who had heard it, a faint ringing in the body you could mistake for bad sleep if you wanted soft explanations.

Leticia slept two hours on the couch and got up in the thick quiet after the radio hosts who think they are personal friends sign off for the day. She felt the fatigue like a map of places she had walked and the adrenaline like someone had taped a coffee spoon to her sternum and it was tapping, tapping, tapping. The device sat by the door on its haunches, silent and smug. She opened the window to let the morning slide in; it came like a warm hand and touched her face and did nothing about the sigh she was saving in her ribs. Her mother texted a photo of a skillet with eggs that had the just-lazy edge that meant the pan had been shy of hot because the gas line in that apartment always ran cheap, and beneath it wrote, in the shorthand of women who have more to do than say: hoy no, m’ija. rest. She answered with a heart because she could not fit the day through a screen without breaking it.

Manny, when he arrived, knocked once and then performed the courtesy of forgetting what he might have seen on her face. He had coffee in a paper cup someone had designed for a different city and a bag of bolillos that were already a little too dry at the ends because humidity here chooses its favorites. They ate on the back steps in the stripe of shade that persisted there because the sun hadn’t gotten around to hurting it yet. He said nothing about the papers with sketches on them that had migrated to the floor like a family of map eels. He stretched his legs and winced at a knee that had been pretending to behave and let the wince become a shrug.

“Someone will come,” he said finally, with the weary precognition of a man who has owed money in three languages. “Not the police right away. The utility first. A man in a shirt the color of a bad idea with a badge clipped to his belt and a folder with your name already printed on a label. He will try to hire you and threaten you in the same sentence. You will say the wrong part of yes and the wrong part of no and I will have to put the good folding chair away so you don’t throw it at him.”

“I need a better clamp,” Leticia said around a mouthful of bread, not because she hadn’t heard him but because the sentence she could say without losing anything was about metal and not men. “And a choke with more spine. And a resistor that won’t cook itself when I ask it to pretend to be brave.”

“You need someone between you and the man in the shirt,” Manny said. “I will be there but I am not tall enough to scare anyone who gets paid to pretend he isn’t. We can invite Ruth. She can stand behind you and look like a librarian who calls senators at home.”

“Ruth will bring me salsa and ask the man if he likes cilantro and accidentally endear him,” Leticia said, and their laughter rattled in the alley in a way that made the feral cat that had refused them for five years decide to forgive them for the day. She let the laughter go as far as it would. It didn’t go far.

The utility arrived by lunch. It came as Manny predicted: a man who had learned how to put a belt around a body like armor and who had shaved too recently to hide his nerves with stubble. He carried a laptop that he opened and closed like a fan at a dance. He stood in the warehouse without touching anything that wasn’t metal and pretended he was not impressed by the order of the chaos, how the coils were not piled but stored with a tenderness that suggested love and not hoarding. He introduced himself as Victor without offering a last name, and when he shook Leticia’s hand he looked the two seconds longer that men use to gather information they think women are hiding in their swimmers. Leticia kept her eyes on his forehead and decided to be kind, because the alternative would be both easy and expensive.

“We have noticed,” he said, and then the word failed him, went out to chase butterflies and did not return. He paperclipped a smile onto his face and tried again. “We recorded some anomalies. Nonlinear events at odd harmonics. Not dangerous. Yet. Not sanctioned. We could call it a glitch. But the logs do not like being lied to.”

“Your transformer south of the river has been singing bad songs for days,” Leticia said, and watched him decide whether to pretend he had known that. “I asked it to sing a different one. I did not hurt it. I did not hurt your precious capacity. I did not make babies cry in their incubators. You can stop clenching, señor.”

Victor unclenched, just enough to be human. “You did… something. It bled into the hospitals without making a mess. That was deliberate.”

“I teach when I can,” Leticia said. “Machines learn. Humans less so.”

“We could use…” He gestured at the device like he was naming a dog he was planning to steal. “Your… sense. We could pay you in papers to sign and guilt you into wearing a vest in public that makes you look like a traffic cone. They will put my name on the press release because it will be easier to spell. You will be listed as a consultant with a fee that brings out cousins you didn’t know had your number. We will tell you not to do the thing you did unless we ask you to do it, and we will ask you to do it first only three times and then we will not ask because we will be afraid you will say no. This is a song you know.”

Leticia saw, for a second, how a hundred versions of the day could go if she let them. She had agreed to worse because the word utility meant something in her mother’s kitchen and her father’s toolbox that corporations had borrowed like cousins and never returned. Manny, at her left shoulder, made the sound he made when he had just seen a person put a screwdriver in a live socket because it looked like a hole where a story might fit. He put a hand on the back of a chair like it wanted to run and whispered something to it that only wood and men who had made their peace with splinters understand.

“I will consult,” Leticia said, and watched Victor anticipate the clause that would follow because men like him forge those in the foundry where they make their guts. “I will not tie my skill to your van. I will not wear your vest. You will not put my face on television with a pixel pattern behind it like I am the weather. I will help you harden the lines until she cannot make the grid her instrument. I will tell you when your stations are lonely. I will tell you when your load is lying. And I will make all of that work at arm’s length because if you hire me you will own my Sundays and then you will own the inside of my head. And you do not get that.”

Victor’s shoulders learned something from her words and dropped a fraction that meant he was a man who, in some other life, might have apprenticed to the right kind of harsh. He nodded once and stowed the personality he had been issued. “I can tell that story to people who wear ties when they should not. They will say no. Then I will say the part about the hospitals again. They will say yes. They will want a non-disclosure that will make you grind your teeth to dust. Say no to that part and we might still do the rest.”

“You will give me maps,” Leticia said. “You will make your boys move when I say move even if they think the direction I am pointing does not exist. You will let me buy the components I need from a person I trust, not your list. And you will bring me the data the night before it goes stale. If you come to me with day-old logs we are done.”

Victor flipped the laptop back open and typed like a man swatting flies. He looked up once, wincing at the sound the keys made in this cavern of wire and light. “You are either going to save us trouble or cost us more than the mayor’s last parade. Seven o’clock. Conference room B, the one with the whining air conditioner and the panoramic poster of a lineworker that is four inches too tall to hang straight. I promise you nothing except that there will be donuts and one of them will not taste like sadness.”

“Bring a fritter,” Manny said, because demands were how you proof a man. “The big ugly one, not the dry one that looks pretty. If you bring a dry one we tell everyone you didn’t bring anything.”

Victor smiled in the way that makes you suspect he hadn’t used the muscles in a while. “Understood.” He turned to go and then pivoted back like a man who, against his will, had found himself in a conversation where he had to share a feeling. “I have a daughter,” he said, and in that word was the apology for the way the world breaks a person into roles and makes them feel like they have to put that one out front. “She is nineteen. She is a scientist when she is alone and a little cruel when she is not. I will bring two fritters.”

Leticia watched him walk out into the heat and the curious light that city delivered to days that looked like any other and weren’t. She let the chair go, let her jaw unclamp, and then swore softly, a hymn in a small church where the saints didn’t mind the profanity because they knew whose names were harder to say. Manny put a bolillo in a bag with reverence and said nothing because the thing she had just agreed to would require him to carry boxes and keep secrets and stave off men with magnetic badges with his shoulder and he would do it because that is what you do when the person you love decides to play music on the heart of a city.

News ran its teeth over the morning without finding blood to bite down on. The blog ran full. Tallulah had posted again before dawn, another thing that read listless if you wanted it to, like a body lounging in a doorframe without wanting to be invited in. hello girls. it’s humid. my hair? unfriendly. there is a bird living under a billboard on grand. i watched him bring a wrapper to his nest like a treasure. i might try it. you collect too. Her followers responded with the usual braided thread of thirst and grammar wars and requests for more specific times and places for the fear they craved. A handful of women used their names instead of avatars and wrote: we are leaving town. we are taking the back roads. we are turning our phones off because it feels like you can hear through them. A man in a sports bar sent her a photograph of his hand with the caption for you, and she closed her eyes and tasted bile and did not answer because cruelty needs occasions, yes, but also audiences, and she had found lately that sometimes she wanted one and sometimes she did not.

She had not slept. She had dozed in the attitude of a person who expects to be called from a dream to do a job she could not leave without being called back again. The itch was gone but the memory of the itch had stayed and made the spaces in her stretch. She had put her palms flat on a roof and pushed and felt the grid push back with a churlish humor she might have liked if it had belonged to a person. She thought she understood what the small woman had done. She had made the city’s hum behave like someone humming a different song in the corner of a room, off by enough to annoy and on by enough to be a challenge. Tallulah admired that. She admired even as she found herself aggravated by the condescension of it, like a mother’s hand on a shoulder that does not need guiding, like the one who had closed her eyes and said be good in a voice that meant be quiet or I will.

At noon she went to the riverside where the bike-scuffed dirt told stories of circles drawn to keep fear from bolting. She did not step inside the fence because a cop with more caution than rank had parked two blocks away and pretended to be part of a different scene. She put her hand in the air like she was testing rain that was not there and listened. The transformer sang the way a solid instrument sings when the room is empty. She missed the wrongness, the burr, the grit. She missed it with a perverse devotion. Who needs me to be out of tune, she thought, and did not like the thing that came to sit down beside that thought. She did not write a post about it because something in her had decided the small woman and her light did not need the favor of being mentioned.

In a bungalow with the color of old paper still holding onto yesterday’s shadows, Leticia stared at a copy of recloser event reports until the numbers bleed into one another like dyes in a bucket. She pushed her chair back and swore at the elegant incompleteness of what they had finally given her. It was enough to see the pattern she had felt all along. Anomalies had preceded Tallulah’s documented steps by a week sometimes, sometimes less, sometimes more. Certain substations behaved like instruments that a person had been tuning by ear. Load dipped when people slept and rose when they woke and then dipped again in a rhythm that had nothing to do with energy consumption and everything to do with convenience. She knew a voice when she heard one even when it was made of units that were supposed to be self-effacing. She touched her pencil to her lip and drew a circle around one station she had written off as boring. Nothing had wobbled there. That was the wobble. That was its own song.

“Here,” she said to Manny, who didn’t need to see where her finger landed to understand the gesture. “She goes quiet here. That’s not mercy. That’s the place where she resets.”

“Safe house,” Manny said, and the phrase put a taste in his mouth that reminded him of houses that had kept him safe and then withdrawn the offer midwinter and made him find another roof. “We should go when she is not there.”

“We should go now,” Leticia said, and she was already pulling her jacket on like a shield against questions. She tucked the device’s smaller cousin into her bag, the one she had soldered with shaky hands a month ago for a joke that had no punchline. She put two water bottles in the side pouch because Manny had learned to look for that detail and he’d be mad if she ignored it. They took the truck in the way that felt like consenting to be pulled by a current they had not named out loud even to each other. The sky stretched toward afternoon with its old ambition, and Dallas did the thing it always did when two people made a plan in it; it put a toe out to trip them and then pretended it had not.

The quiet station sat behind a feed mill that had painted a mural of corn exploding into fireworks as if to argue with the sentence that grain dust writes when it catches a spark. The fence stood up straight and did not sag for them. The sign that said danger had been treated with a respect that spoke of old fear and not just new litigation. Leticia stood with her palms on the chain-link and felt the hum through metal and air and old stories about what fences mean. This was a contented station. It was fed well and unbothered. More importantly, nothing had tried to talk to it when Tallulah moved through its shadow. Either she moved around it like a person with a superstition about a certain corner of a room, or she stood here and let calm soak in the way you put your feet in a river until the bones remember where they started.

She closed her eyes and let the skin around her ears soften. Manny watched the road the way he always did when they were doing a thing the city didn’t love. He had learned the sightlines here, the ways trucks could appear at the corner of his sight and turn a day into paperwork. He watched and thought he saw, down where the utility had mistakenly planted a crepe myrtle, someone watching them back. A girl, maybe, with a phone lit and a ponytail that suggested she had learned to run if she needed to. He put his body between Leticia and the view of the road without making a meal out of it.

Leticia stepped back. “She likes this one,” she said. “It behaves. It does not remind her that everything she is balancing has sharp teeth. We could make it misbehave. But that would be a prayer to a God that builds smiting into the fine print.”

“We leave it,” Manny said simply. His hand flexed once, his knuckles remembering a fight and then forgetting it because he told them to. “We learn the shape of its quiet and we do not break what we might need later.”

They stood for a time that had nothing to do with clocks and then went home by a route that cut through neighborhoods where women pushed strollers built like small tanks and old men watered their lawns with the resigned hope of people who know heat the way you know an uncle who drinks. Back at the warehouse the device in the corner called to Leticia like a child who wants to be picked up for no reason other than the proof of touch. She ignored it and answered her phone instead because a reporter had indeed learned her name and had tried the polite route first.

The reporter was young in the way of people who have figured out how to be old when it suits them. She had a voice like a morning that has chosen to be cloudy. She introduced herself as Rima and said she meant no harm with the carefulness of someone who understood how harm is usually offended at being misgendered. She said she wanted to ask questions about responsibility that did not require anyone to pull out a hero costume. She said she had also worked as a line cook and would accept no from a person if it was said like a knife coming down on a board.

“No interviews,” Leticia said, and was surprised to hear the smallest sound of relief in her own tone. “No spells for your story. No hooks for your listeners. You can ask me a question that you would want to ask me if the camera were in a drawer.”

Rima breathed a smile into the line. “Okay. Who keeps you honest when you are doing what you are doing? Who tells you no when your hands are already on the dial?”

“Gravity,” Leticia said. “Heat. The fact that copper does not care about my feelings. And Manny.”

“I figured Manny,” Rima said. “It’s always a Manny or a church lady. Sometimes it’s both. One more. Do you think she will come for you for what you did.”

“I think she has already come as close as she intends to without making it boring for herself,” Leticia said. “I think she has a plan the way pain is a plan. I think if I make her tired enough she might take a nap. That is all I can want without pretending I know what stories do when they get hungry.”

Rima was quiet long enough to make the silence a third voice. “I won’t put your name in it,” she said. “People who need to know it will know it anyway. If you change your mind, set a cup on your porch and tilt it. I will understand.”

When she hung up, Leticia put her forehead against the cool window pane and let the city’s reflected face line up with her own until she looked like a map of something nobody had surveyed since a flood. She stood like that until Manny knocked a spool off a shelf on purpose and swore loud enough to make her grin because the day had started to take itself too seriously.

On the blog, Tallulah made a résumé of a person out of the things she had decided to say in public instead of the things she had done when the public was not looking. hello girls. today a man said i was brave. i laughed because if he had seen the day i was nineteen and could not open my mouth to say i am sorry he would not use that word. i am taking scissors to my hair because heat is a thief and i am tired of being robbed. do you ever want to cut something and be lighter without learning the knot you just made with the air. She did it on a rooftop and did it badly, because some acts lose their poetry when you realize you need practice to make them graceful. The wind took the dark rope she had cut and lay it down across the letters of a sign that advertised flooring, and a man driving by prayed without knowing he was praying because something about the sight of hair rather than a body near an edge pressed old buttons in the part of him that had once been told to call for an adult.

Leticia’s mother came over with a loaf of bread she could not afford and an opinion she could not stop herself from carrying. She opened cabinets with the authority of someone who had once owned every room and then lost the title and continued to make dinners anyway. She sat at the table and looked at her daughter’s knuckles and made a noise that meant both pride and complaint. She did not say the giant’s name because superstition had a chair at this table and she would not be the one to tell it to get up. She asked questions about Manny’s knees and did not ask questions about contracts and then ended up in front of the panel with the neatness of her hair making it look like she had come to fix the electricity with a rosary. “You be careful,” she said in the tone that turns careful into a synonym for try harder but sleep sooner. “You are not a flame.”

“I am not,” Leticia said, and then, because she could not help herself, added, “I am a circuit.”

Her mother rolled her eyes so hard she could have seen God if she had wanted to. “No metaphors,” she said. “Metaphors turn into excuses. You will eat a tortilla for what you did to me with that sentence.”

They ate in a house that had not changed much since the morning, which felt like a victory of its own. After her mother left with a chicken wrapped in a dish towel because she did not trust anyone’s refrigerator but her own, Manny put his feet up and they were quiet in the way people are when noise has done its shift and gone to lie down. The sense that the night had an appointment sat between them like another person spoiled by attention. When it came, it came with a hum that was not new and a mischief that was. The city made room for her the way a body makes room for splinters and then forgets for a long time that it is accommodating something that does not belong.

She chose a theater. Of course she did. It was closed, because the owner had been a man who trusted lists that said markets are robust and had failed to respect the personality of roofs. The seats had gone to a church in Mesquite, the grape soda stain on aisle four had dried into the color of history, and the curtain had refused to rot just to prove to someone you could resist your own materials if you were stubborn. She lowered herself onto the roof and peered in the glass of the foyer where someone had left a standee of a woman with impossible eyelashes advertising a romance that had tried too hard and therefore convinced nobody. If the smallness of the memory hadn’t choked her she would have laughed. What she did instead was reach out and draw a loop on the glass with her fingertip. She was not alone in recognizing the gesture. Across town, two women who read the blog at the same time texted one another the same message without planning it: she’s practicing again.

Leticia got the alert everyone got, which meant nothing. Then the station in the better part of town that had never been called better by anyone who lived there hiccuped, and the hiccup skimmed through the lines to a courthouse that wore its ghosts with the elegance of old money. She tasted metal and put her hands on the desk because sometimes you have to convince gravity you are already on its team. Manny didn’t wait for her to tell him to go. He went. He threw the small device into the truck and pointed the nose toward the theater because old places keep new secrets and he would rather sit across the street and pretend to text than let it keep its own counsel. Leticia called Victor and told him to breathe, to let the hiccup go through, and to make his boys throw the switch on a line that would make rich people angry and keep a maternity ward from blinking. He did it. He did it with the voice of someone who would argue later with a person who had never drawn breath in an ER and he did it now because a woman who knew the map of his fear had told him to.

The itch this time arrived soft, almost a flirtation, as if the city had learned something from the last pass. Tallulah felt it in the soles of her feet and the places under her eyes where tired sits when it has nowhere else to go. She turned toward it with a slowness that might have read as sensual to people who required everything to be an invitation. She felt annoyance creep up her back and caged it carefully, because if she let it out it would throw furniture and she did not have time for the noise. She pretended not to hear the sirens that were always auditioning for parts in other evenings. She ran the back of her hand over the loop she had just drawn and erased it, and the erasing felt like nothing and everything at once. She wanted a cigarette because want is a habit that looks for any excuse to wear a new face. She did not have one. She went toward the itch.

Across the street Manny lifted the lantern like a joke and then turned it off because right now it meant the wrong things. He had the feeling he used to get in bars when the man three stools down had decided the woman at the jukebox owed him something and Manny had been elected by no one to make the scene less biblical. He put the device on the hood and hated it for looking like a toolbox and not a treaty. He texted Leticia the worst words in their shared vocabulary. he said: now. hurry. She came without deciding to. She came because both of them belonged to the part of the city that calls from the inside of your mouth.

She did not turn the dial all the way up. She gave it just enough to be rude. The wave went out like a rumor you had verified twice and decided to share anyway. The theater moaned in its rafters, a sound that was not a building but a memory the building was still hoarding. Tallulah put her hand out as if to catch something that would have broken if it fell. The itch threaded the muscles along her jaw and then settled into her clavicle like a pet; it hurt and it did not, it annoyed and it soothed, and she hated that she could not tell which she was supposed to choose. She stopped moving because motion had always been how she had outrun choices. She stood with the loop of her erased finger a shine on the glass and considered walking away. It would be easy to turn the night into a ghost. It would be honest to say later that she had decided to be merciful.

She did neither. She bent and instead of breaking a thing, she picked one up. The standee, the woman with eyelashes that meant grief for someone in a factory in China and meant nothing to the star who had signed away the rights to her own face. Tallulah lifted it carefully and held it like a shield and then an offering, something so ridiculous that the men with guns a block away would not know whether to own their fear or their laughter. She propped it against the door in a way that would make the first person who saw it jump and then laugh and then jump again at their own laugh. She did this smallness in front of the itch like you apologize in a language the other person does not speak because it makes you feel like you tried. Then she lifted her head and found the small woman with the hands and the wrong machine watching her from a truck as if that truck had been built for this moment.

“Do you want to dance?” she said, not loudly, and the itch pretended to be the music and not the floor.

Leticia did not put the volume up. She made a new thing instead. She shifted the pulse a hair early, then late, then early again. Syncopation had always been a way to invite and deny. She invited and denied. The machine answered not with strings but with persistence, which in the end is all music is. She did not say yes to the dance because that was a metaphor the night had offered her and she would not take it. She said, “Go home. Not because I asked. Because you want to not be the thing you were yesterday twice in a row.”

The word home hit a place in Tallulah that had not developed callus. She put her palm to her chest as if the pendant phone she wore were heavier than it had any right to be. The itch settled into her hand and turned quiet. She nodded not because she was conceding but because the word had rung, and when a bell rings you nod to it because your grandmother taught you manners even if the church had stolen her shoes. She set the cardboard woman back upright and adjusted the tilt of her face because there are indignities you do not wish on other women even when they are made of pulp. Then she stepped back, took two strides, and turned like a ship made of nastiness and grief and cunning and moved toward the west.

Leticia let the dial find the original hum like a train that has been allowed back on its track. She turned it off and the absence was so loud she almost turned it back on to have something to hold. Manny set the lantern down without reverence and reached for her wrist to take a pulse he did not need to take. They sat in the truck with the windows open and let the heat argue with the little wind the night had decided to be generous with. Neither of them spoke until the patrol car that had idled two blocks down slunk away because it was not the kind of night it could write up without looking stupid.

When Leticia finally found words that did not taste like metal, she said, “She will learn me.” It was not fear so much as a complaint to fate. “She will learn to anticipate and then we will have to write a new song.”

“Then you write,” Manny said, and he meant the simplest meaning of the word and also the ones that had nothing to do with paper. “You make eighty of them. You make one that only works on Thursday when you haven’t slept. You make one for when your mother is in the room. You make one for when I have to hold the light and have to pee. You make two for the day she is too sad to keep being cruel and you do not mistake it for forgiveness.”

They went home through a slice of town noticing that nobody had patched the pothole that had opened after the last heavy storm, and the fact of it made Leticia so angry for one second that she had to breathe into her hands the way her grandmother had taught her. She had the sense, that old feeling like someone watching from the corner of the room, and turned her head to see if there were smudges on her window at home and there were not and she hated that the absence made her feel left out of her own story.

At dawn the phone on the kitchen table vibrated like a bee that had learned ringtones. The message was from an address that was probably a child of an algorithm and maybe a woman and maybe Tallulah or maybe Tallulah’s opposite. The subject line read: three names do you know them, and the body of the email had nothing but three words. Jo. Mari. Lila. Leticia stared until the words blurred into the same word because grief will do that to a list. She did not answer because there was nothing to say that did not imagine itself brave and would be a lie as soon as it left her tongue.

Across the river on a roof the color of an old bruise, Tallulah lay on her back and did not sleep and rehearsed the names that had made the hallway she had never found a door out of. Jo who had been brave in the real way, carrying a coat nobody else wanted and saying it wasn’t heavy, and whom Tallulah had cut open with a sentence she had thought was adult. Mari with the paper-thin laugh who had told her secrets as if secrets were seeds and then had watched nothing grow. Lila with a scar like a comma who had said, we can do the cruel thing lightly if we do it together, and then had flinched when the lightness had turned to weight as it always does. She did not say their names aloud because the city did not deserve to hear them with its current voice. She put her arm over her eyes like a visor and made a promise to herself she knew she would break because the breaking had been wired into her long before she decided to become an interruption with a pulse and a blog.

In the afternoon, rain came with an apology stitched into it that nobody needed. It slicked oil into colors in the parking lot behind the feed store and drove grasshoppers against the metal door of the warehouse until their little bodies made a sound like water with bones. Leticia stood under the eave and watched the water draw new lines on the ground and thought about rivers pretending to be lines and lines pretending to be rivers. Victor stood in a conference room with an air conditioner that had learned to sound injured and told a room full of men and two women that a consultant had put the city’s hum in a harness, and the ones who had daughters nodded at different parts along with the ones who had seen men die quietly. Manny fixed the latch on the truck door because it had begun to betray them at stoplights. The city held itself upright because that is its trick. The giant posted nothing. The lights held. For a day, everyone slept in a relief made of borrowed time and old routines and woke to find their coffee tasting a little like copper and a little like victory, which is to say like something you drink even if you don’t like it because the day has to be met somehow.The second day after the rain, the building with the whining air conditioner delivered the exact kind of meeting everyone had promised it would, which is to say, a performance of professionalism where donuts played the role of contrition. Conference Room B had a panoramic poster of a lineworker cropped at the ankles so that his boots looked like they were about to step into the carpet, and Victor arranged paper cups for coffee with the palms-up motion of a man who knows he is asking for a lot and has been told palms help. Leticia arrived with the smell of solder still tucked behind her ear like old perfume and took the chair that gave her a view of the thermostat, because she did not like conversations where she couldn’t see who was turning the climate. Manny sat to her left and cultivated a neutrality that made three men in poorly chosen ties mistake him for furniture until he breathed in a way that made the table remember it was wood and not a boulder.

“I will skip the preface,” Victor said after everyone finished glancing at everyone else’s coffee. “She will not stop because we ask. We can annoy her. We can refuse to be an instrument. We can shorten the window where she feels the city like a favorite shirt. Doctor Salgado has shown us one method. We will not repeat the method as if it were a prayer that saves us. We will vary. We will learn to hum off-key. We will accept the angry calls and send those callers a tote bag.”

The laughter that followed had more relief than humor in it. A woman in a crisp blouse that did not forgive sweat made a note about recloser programming and then looked over the top of her glasses the way a schoolteacher used to look at a boy with a sling on his arm and a firecracker in his pocket. “We need a plan for hospitals,” she said. “I do not need to tell you how they felt the last time the frequency wobbled. We cannot rely on her being in a good mood the next time a NICU’s monitors are singing.”

Leticia leaned forward and let her pencil put its weight on the page without writing. “I will not touch your hospitals. If my signal brushes them in the process of reaching her, I will adjust to keep the brush light. I am not your saint; I am not your villain; I am your metronome. I am not responsible for the days you forgot to maintain the backup generation at the old wing because the budget asked you to pretend aging does not apply to wires. I will build fences that are not fences so when she leans, the pushback feels lazy and constant. She will hate lazy. We will make the city boring at the exact places she wants to make interesting.”

One of the men who smelled faintly of lake water from a morning habit of rowing blinked at the word boring as if it were a new concept and not the city’s most sacred wish. He drummed his fingers and looked at Manny, perhaps because Manny had done nothing to deserve anyone’s attention, and asked, “And who holds the light when the room gets dark.”

Manny smiled in a way that put a sliver of silver into his front tooth on display and shrugged as if suggesting the universe had failed to assign him a different role. “I hold the light. And when my hand gets tired, I switch hands. You want better poetry than that, go to a bookstore.”

They discussed recloser timing and harmonic injection the way people discuss recipes at funerals, carefully and with an eye toward substitutions. They agreed on three pilot stations to install the metronomes, two in neighborhoods that would complain on television and one in a place nobody filmed unless a truck caught fire. Leticia requested parts by name and by manufacturer and ignored the way the purchasing officer winced at costs because she had learned long ago that you pay for the right alloys now or you bleed later. She drew a diagram for a field engineer who wore a ring made of something precious but kept turning it as if it might translate an anxiety into a task and he watched the pencil move like it might take off if he looked away. Victor produced two fritters of genuinely obscene size and slid one toward Manny, who nodded at the gesture like it had earned him two days’ grace on all favors.

Rima’s piece arrived in the city like a breeze that had heard about wind and decided to do a smaller version. She did not use names. She said a woman had made the grid inhospitable where it had become too hospitable to a person who treated it like a choir. She said hero was a word that would not fit but guts fit fine and sometimes guts look like a person choosing to be boring so that other people can be interesting on their own terms. She described the hum in prose that held no metaphors hostage, and she ended by saying she had worked the night shift in a kitchen where the ventilation never behaved and knew the difference between a system that has moods and a system that has allergies. Leticia read it with her eyes narrowed as if the words might leap and bite and then allowed herself the smallest Yes that a body can make without giving permission for a second one to arrive. Her mother read it late and called to say, with both a curse and a blessing in the same tone, that the journalist had good ears and should eat more because no one with that kind of bone shows up on a morning shift without needing extra tortillas.

Tallulah did not read the piece because she did not need to be told in someone else’s language that her evening had been intercepted by a small woman with a hand on a dial. She walked the river as far as someone of her shape could walk the river without sending geese flapping like paper bags, and she tried to hum her own song under the city’s and found herself annoyed to discover she needed breath. The quiet station behind the mural with exploding corn waited for her like a room where no one expected anything. She stood on the wrong side of its fence and placed the flat of her palm against the air above a transformer and felt the low purr climb from skin to bone. It reminded her of dogs in trucks with their heads out the windows, eyes half-closed, uncomplicated except for a longing they would never articulate because they didn’t need to. She leaned her weight forward and counted without thinking, an old piano teacher’s voice reminding her that count and sing cannot be done with the same part of your mouth. Jo had played the piano and had hated counting because rhythm felt like a superstition. Mari had collected pennies and placed them in a line on a windowsill like they were prayers to small gods. Lila had written a sentence on the inside of a closet with a pen she had stolen from a bank. Tallulah let their names arrive and leave and did nothing with them because doing something with them right now would only embarrass her.

The city pushed back in other ways. On a lawn where a sign had once begged a councilman to think of children, a father arranged other fathers into an organism with arms and patience and slogans printed on shirts that had not been pre-washed. They called themselves protectors, a word that had been burnt and reheated so many times it had the texture of old meat, and they posted schedules and routes and told their daughters to text twice when they arrived. Women watched from inside and made their own schedules in smaller circles with fewer shirts and more snacks, deciding between them who would swap keys and who would be the person who said, out loud so the room could hear, I am scared. It was not organized enough to be a movement and not disorderly enough to be a riot, and the city did what it always does when people gather because fear has found a seat; it adjusted the sound. An intersection learned to hold its breath so a school bus could pass. A porch light burned steady in a way it hadn’t since the year before the owner’s mortgage had stopped feeling like a promise and started feeling like ballast.

At the warehouse, Leticia built fences that were not fences. She and Manny installed updated relays that looked like nothing special and rewrote settings in devices that would never understand they had been given a new rudeness. She soldered a small coil into a casing that would fit where no manager would look, and she named it nothing and placed it in a bag marked with tape that read Misc in handwriting that would trick men with badges into ignoring it. Manny, between tasks, told a story about a bartender who had once lifted a man off his stool by the collar and made him apologize to the jukebox for shouting at it. “It takes listening to know when to apologize to an object,” he said, and Leticia nodded and didn’t bother to say that most of her life was that, because it was understood.

They took the first metronome into the field on a night that smelled like a wrench left in rain. The station they chose sang without inflection, which is to say it felt like a level surface, and Leticia let the new rhythm slide in under the existing one like a second sheet under a sleeping child who would kick at the first if it wrinkled. She talked softly to the case because labels like On and Off were not enough to convince machines you had the right to ask them to be brave. Manny looked at the sky and said twice in an hour the name of a star he had read on a map when he was ten, to remind himself that maps get things wrong and that it doesn’t ruin the trip. When the wave went live, the line did not twitch as much as it sighed, and the work felt like combing stubborn hair with patience instead of buzz-cutting because impatience pretending to be efficiency is a violence he had seen too many times.

Tallulah found the change the way a person finds a loose thread in a sweater and can’t stop their fingers from worrying it even though they know what will happen. She went to a bridge that had become famous because someone once took a photograph from the right angle and the city had made a joke of it and then tried to unmake the joke and failed, for cities do not recover quickly from seeing themselves, however briefly, as ridiculous. She stood on the pedestrian span and watched a couple pretend not to see her because they had a fight they had come to repeat and didn’t want a giant to make them have the version of it they would tell their friends. The itch was not an itch anymore; it had become a texture, a grain in the surface of the day. She put her hand on the arch and felt it hum back because metal likes it when you touch it like a friend, and for a moment she imagined lying down on the side of the river where the floodplain gathered secrets and letting the city pour over her like a quilt that had learned to be heavy in exactly the right way. Then the memory of the last time she had let herself rest in public rose like a rash, and she pocketed the thought and folded it small.

She posted, because the ritual made her feel like the part of her that understood punctuation still had a job. She wrote in a paragraph because she felt like being contrary to herself and to the machine, and the words went out: hello girls, today I am thinking about standing still where a breeze can find me and the way starlings make a shape together without voting. if you were me where would you go to forget that your hands remember everything. The comments arrived like a weather front. Some said church. Some said their grandmother’s porch that had been torn down by men who said development like it was a prayer. One said nowhere because forgetting is propaganda. One said the movies and did not intend a knife but still brought a blade into the room by accident. She closed her eyes and let the language move through her the way water used to when she was a kid who had learned there are two kinds of swimming, the kind done for joy and the kind done to get away.

Ruth brought salsa so hot it made Leticia hiccup, and she stood in the doorway and announced without greeting that the tomatoes would cry if they weren’t eaten now and that she had brought a plant cutting in a jar because the neighbor threw away a length of pothos you could use to draw a line around a room and call it owned. She lingered with the air of a woman who did not want to leave the place where work smelled like competence and hope and tape. She asked, indirectly and then directly, if Leticia was safe, and when Leticia answered with a version of yes that made Manny look at the ceiling to keep himself from arguing with the word, Ruth accepted the lie and offered a trade. “You tell me when you are lying,” she said lightly, drawing an arc on the dusty table with her forefinger, “and I will bring fewer hot peppers to your door so your stomach knows the difference between the damage you do to yourself and the damage I bring you for flavor.”

In the conference room with the maimed poster, Victor learned to say no to men more senior by pretending the word yes had been heard and then implementing the version of no that would save the most time. He discovered that when he put Leticia on speakerphone in a meeting and she said frequency the room fell quieter than when he said budget, and he began to use the word as a secret door. He found himself thinking about his daughter in the pauses between sentences and decided not to tell her what he did, not because he wanted to keep a secret but because some work feels nobler if it goes unnamed in your own house. He and the woman with the crisp blouse wrote down which lines to harden with heavy marker and he filed the paper in a folder labeled with a word that made a man in procurement laugh accidentally and then stop when he realized the price of the joke.

The second night the city offered a problem, the problem did not offer a headline. A storm south of the river pulled a line into a posture that was unsustainable and then apologized with lightning that kissed a tree too intimately. The substation adjusted the way a good knee does when someone’s weight shifts on a staircase there is no reason to fear. Leticia’s fence made the correction feel like boredom, and only a dog under a deck barked in a new pattern. Tallulah felt the correction as absence and found that the absence hurt more than the itch had, because something had been taken that she had made into a friend. She walked to an empty parking lot the size of a bad plan and stood with her head up the way you do when the snow melts and the sky has the gall to pretend it invented blue. She set an alarm on the pendant she wore and allowed herself twenty minutes to do nothing but be as quiet as a building. She made it to nineteen, and the twentieth became a memory she would embellish later as if failing by a minute could be turned into something she did on purpose.

The third day she left a message where only one person would see it without accident. She had gone to Leticia’s street not because she wanted to play the worst game but because curiosity can be cruel the way children can be cruel when they do not know yet what stories will stick to them. The bungalow wore its exhaustion like a shawl but still held itself upright and the windows were not immaculate, which relieved her in a way that made her angry. She reached with the concentration of someone threading a needle in a moving car and pressed her knuckle to the glass, not hard, not claiming, and drew a small shape from a language she had learned without admitting she loved it. The shape was the symbol engineers draw for resistance, the zigzag that looks like a cartoon of lightning if lightning had been asked to wear a tie. She left it a little crooked because perfection is always a threat. She walked away in a direction that would make the security camera on the corner get her wrong the first time and right the next, and she posted nothing because some acts do not need a chorus.

Leticia saw it at noon because she had the discipline not to look earlier. She stood on the porch holding a cup of water she would forget to drink and watched the sun turn the smudge into something that might have been a child’s doodle if you wanted a softer explanation for why your heart had changed temperature. She did not call Manny because he would bring a cloth and a joke and she did not want either. She did not call her mother because her mother would recite an Our Father in Spanish and in English and then make her repeat the one she always forgot and they would both feel better and worse. She texted Victor a photograph with the path of a resistor drawn over it in green as if to annotate, and he answered with a thumb and a string of profanity addressed not to the giant but to the fact of life that always insists on becoming personal when you have begged it to stay public. She stood there long enough for the neighbor to come out and collect a package that belonged to someone else, and when the neighbor said, “Hot,” in a way that carried all the other sentences she had decided not to say, Leticia nodded and made the same noncommittal sound, and they agreed by not agreeing to keep each other’s secrets at the level of greeting.

That evening, on the levee where grass had learned to hold on with optimism bordering on foolishness, a clumsy plan shimmered into being with the kind of inevitability that arrives when no one person wants to stand up and say they have a better idea. Victor’s people, under instructions that had been phrased carefully enough to avoid the lawsuits a man in a blue suit practiced for in his bedroom, had carved a narrow quiet space into the hum, an absence shaped like a bed. Leticia had suggested nothing with that kind of metaphor stuck to it, but the map had offered the place and the place had made suggestions of its own. Manny parked the truck with its nose pointed toward no escaping and laid tools out as if surgery were going to be done on an organism that was mostly imagination. Rima stood far back, hair braided tight as if it needed to hold something more than itself, and refused to lift the camera to her eye because she had made a promise to nobody but herself not to be the one to make an image that would say more than was true.

Tallulah came at the hour that people who wake before dawn begin to forgive the day for being ambitious. She did not make herself small because she couldn’t; she did not make herself large because she already was. She stepped onto the patch of grass that had been told to become a room and the hum under her back when she lay down started as complaint and became instead the kind of song a mother hums when she doesn’t remember the words. The river smelled like old iron and weeds that believed in flooding and the sky made its best blue as if it wanted to show the right kind of witness could make any day holy. She lay on her side first, because lying on the back is an intimacy she had not afforded the world in years, and then she turned with a sigh that moved the air and the grass and the imagination of every mosquito within a mile that thought it might get a feast and decided to be polite instead. The itch did not come. The absence did. The absence was a nerve she could not find to scratch. She put her hand flat on her ribcage as if to hold herself down on earth and let the silence press until it took the shape of her and stopped feeling like an enemy.

People watched badly, which is to say they stared when they should have blinked and blinked when they should have looked. A few approached and then stepped back, piloted by good sense or the muscle-memory of living in a place where looking can be read as permission. A man with a dog asked the dog if he saw it and the dog looked at him like the only thing worth seeing is the hand that reaches for the leash. A woman with a child named after a grandmother who had died in a kind of quiet no one spoke about turned the stroller in the direction of home and felt relief and an ache at the same time and could not explain either to herself later. Rima positioned herself so that if she raised the camera, no face but the giant’s would appear, and she did not raise it because she willfully believed in the righteousness of some moments being jealous of their own fidelity.

The first noise that could have ruined it arrived disguised as kindness. A drone fell out of a boy’s backpack like a raccoon falling out of a trash can, and he was not a cruel boy, only one who had learned that machines were a way to control the distance between you and other people. He sent it up and it did what machines do; it went too close and confronted scale and then lied to itself about control. Its little rotors whined the way gnats do and then the boy forgot which stick meant left and the thing zipped like a fly toward a sleeping animal and panic moved through the little group like rain under a door. Manny swore, and then he laughed because the swear needed an escort, and then he stepped forward with a hand up as if he could catch the drone with that gesture. Tallulah opened one eye, the kind of opening you make when you’ve been woken and you are choosing whether to be angry. She could have plucked the drone, crushed it, flicked it into the river for a catfish to consider, and she did none of those because for a breath she was not interested in being the instrument of anyone’s lesson. She lifted a hand and air moved because she moved, and the drone drifted sideways as if it had remembered that getting close is not the same as being brave. Leticia, without meaning to, adjusted the hum, a breath shorter, a breath longer, and the absence softened the way a bed does when a sleeper rolls and finds the cool side.

When the boy retrieved the drone, cheeks blotted with humiliation he would turn into a story later that made him larger than he had been, he kept his eyes down because eye contact here would have made him a protagonist and he did not want to be in this chapter. His aunt, who had told his mother she would teach him about boundaries and then prayed she wouldn’t be asked to define the word, put her hand on his shoulder and squeezed once with all the words she did not say. Rima finally lifted her camera and took one picture, not of face or scale or spectacle, but of the place where the grass had remembered to stand back up after it had been pressed, and she would look at that photograph later and see nothing but green and decide that was enough.

Tallulah sat up when the relief became boredom and then made herself stay one minute longer because leaving when you want to sometimes means you miss the part where the day gives you a secret. She stood, the long lift a body makes when it has chosen to endure even if only for an hour, and she glanced at Leticia and did the smallest half-shrug, the family of gesture that says I did not hate that and also do not think you have me in your pocket. Leticia nodded once, the kind of nod you make at a stranger who let you merge in traffic, and did not touch the dial because sometimes dignity is leaving the switch alone. The hum sustained. The absence had learned to become a kind of presence, and it would remember where she had been even after she left, the way heat remembers a body.

After, when she went home to the place she went when she had promised herself to call it that for at least three months at a time, she boiled water in a pan while staring at the coffee maker she could not fit her hands into and laughed at herself because laughing at domestic inconveniences is a cheap way to pretend you know the price of tenderness. She made coffee that tasted like defeat and still drank it because it was hers. She wrote a post in another paragraph because it pleased her to break her own cadence and said that water negotiates with heat and sometimes wins the argument by turning into something else entirely. She did not use the word steam because she had seen something evaporate out of herself long before she grew into a being that appeared immune to physics, and she did not want to give that loss a name.

Leticia and Manny drove home in the sort of quiet that is not empty but full of the sounds you did not make. They did not take the freeway because the freeway belonged to the version of the city that insists on pretending that going fast is the same thing as making progress. They cut through a neighborhood where every other car had a bumper sticker announcing a different philosophy of suffering, and Manny pointed with his chin at a lawn contained by a fence that had been painted the color of calm. “You think she will stop,” he asked, not so much a question as an invitation to speculate as a way to relieve pressure.

“I think stop is not a word that belongs to her right now,” Leticia said. “I think pause is. I think distract is. I think we made her day into something she could sit inside of without clawing at the upholstery, and I think that means tomorrow she will find a different chair to wreck. I will make more chairs. You will hold more light. Then someday she will walk out of the room because we annoyed her into finding a different house.”

Manny nodded and made a noise that might have been agreement or resignation or indigestion and then took a left where he usually took a right out of superstition. Leticia put her hand out the window and let the air braid her fingers into a small rope, and the tiny callus near her thumb from the soldering iron leaned into the wind for the kind of sting that lets you know you’re alive without drawing blood.

When she got home the resistor symbol on the window had softened with heat in a way that made it look like an E drawn by a child learning the letter for the first time. Her mother was asleep on the couch with the sound of a game show turning contestants into content at a volume that suggested the television and the old woman had agreed to keep one another alive. The plant Ruth had brought had decided to live despite conditions that would have made a more sensitive vine give up and drop to the floor like a ribbon. Leticia stood very still and let the house inventory her body, the door frame measuring the span of her shoulders, the floor re-memorizing the sound of her boot heel, the kitchen light performing its tiny delay before coming on so that she would have something to curse. She felt, under all that domestic audit, the city still humming, and she could tell by the song that Tallulah had not gone to the theater or to Deep Ellum or to the river to draw loops on glass. She had gone somewhere Leticia did not expect to be quiet and made it quiet by force of attention, and the part of Leticia that did not enjoy being surprised by anything mechanical conceded grudging admiration.

In a house where the air conditioning had begun to cough like an old man politely, Victor sat with his daughter and watched a show she liked where people in suits said words like discovery and objection and coincidentally had hair that was always saying yes. He did not tell her that he had listened to a woman on a levee make the city indifferent for an hour so that a different woman could rest. He did tell her that there are days when your job is to flatten the world so other people can put something on it, and she said, in the way of nineteen-year-olds who have learned that new words can be used like knives, that flattening was colonial, and he laughed because her sharpness was something he had prayed for without knowing what it would cost, and then he went into the kitchen and ate cold pizza and thought about buying better flashlights.

In an apartment with a ceiling fan that had learned to sigh, Rima looked at the one photograph she had taken and decided not to sell her editor on anything. She wrote one paragraph and set it aside and then wrote it again without adjectives and set it aside again and then sent a message to a list of women she had been building slowly since she moved to this city. The message said there is a quiet at the river that might happen again, and if you want to know what it feels like to be safe you can stand far away and be part of it without telling anyone the next day. She put her phone face-down and the silence that followed felt like respect and not neglect.

Night pulled itself over the city with the same clumsy grace it always wore, and somewhere a transformer sang one note wrong and then corrected, embarrassed like a person who had mispronounced a name and had the decency to blush. Tallulah lay on a roof the way a person lies on a flat fact, and she did not sleep because sleeping with the hum had always meant she would dream about the day her mouth had failed to say the necessary word and her body had decided to study the shape of largeness instead. She spoke into the machine she wore, not a post, only a sentence stored as a draft in the software’s little cupboard, and the sentence said that she would leave the city for a day if she could be certain everyone would forget her for exactly twenty-four hours and then remember her only as a silhouette against old air. She did not hit publish because there was no kindness in offering fantasies to a room full of people who had to wake up and go to jobs where the word fantasy meant a poster on the wall of a break room.

Dawn came with a taste like pennies, which in this city could be a blessing if you decided it was. The utility’s men softened because sleep had taught them that obedience is easier in the morning. The fathers reheated their slogans and the daughters rehearsed their ignoring. Ruth sent a text that said She is learning, and Leticia wrote back that Learning is not linear and Ruth replied with an eggplant emoji because her thumbs were no longer interested in the tyranny of grammar. The resistor symbol remained on the glass until the sun reached it and then softened into something a child might trace, and Leticia, standing with a sponge in her hand and the memory of the levee still in her knees, made herself leave it until after coffee because ritual is how you refuse to let danger decide your schedule.

Before ten, a thing broke that had nothing to do with giants and everything to do with aging, which is to say a man in a one-story office breathed into a paper bag when the lights went out and remembered that the last time something had flickered like that he had been attached to a machine that had threatened to take over his heart’s job. The station hiccuped, the recloser did what it had been told to do, and Leticia’s fence made the blur into a nap instead of a spell, and if anyone later asked why the heart in that office kept going in an hour where nothing else felt steady, the answer would not include the name of an enormous woman or the name of a small one. That pleased Leticia more than she would have admitted because she had always liked the kinds of miracles that had to be discovered by reading a log.

By afternoon, a rumor moved downtown that did not carry her name because for once she had not put it there. It said there would be a meeting under the white bridge where anyone could say what they wanted to say without being arrested by the story that had attached itself to their faces. It was not a trap set by men with agendas or women with charities or children with cameras; it was only a rumor, and yet people aligned themselves in its direction as if aligning gave their bodies permission to practice what their mouths refused to attempt. Tallulah went because rumors that do not include you and ought to are irresistible. Leticia went because places where a bridge makes shade are where she has always liked to listen. Manny went because whenever you put a crowd between a woman he loves and a river he carries a towel and a lie he can tell if it gets strange.

They stood in the kind of gathering that is either a prayer or a riot depending on what happens next, and they waited for a leader to arrive and tell them what to feel. No leader came. A woman in a shirt from a school with a mascot that should have been retired two elections ago clapped and then stopped because she had not meant to draw attention and the clap felt like a betrayal. A kid on a BMX rode a circle around a trash can and then hopped it with an economy of motion that made three grown men clap without noticing they had, and the kid’s mouth twitched upward for a second and then went flat again in case anyone was looking at him. Tallulah stayed back because stepping forward changes the physics of a crowd and she did not want to be the physics. Leticia edged to where the shadow was enough and positioned herself so the wind would carry the hum of the bridge’s cables to her ears because cables will tell you gossip if you remember to listen.

Words happened the way words do when they are not being recorded, which is to say messily and honestly and with multiple endings that contradict one another. A woman said she was tired. Another said I am not tired I am angry and the first nodded because anger is energy and tired is gravity and both refuse to be fired. A man said we will protect you and a chorus of women said stop, almost kind, and the man flinched and then laughed at himself and then stepped back into the place men go when they realize the part of the story they were trying to inhabit has been occupied for generations by women who did not want to write it but had to. Someone mentioned the blog as if it were a thunderstorm and someone else said stop giving it rain. A girl spoke about the place in her apartment where the wall is softer because the last tenant had hung a mirror there for years and how she had touched it and felt the softness and thought about faces staring and about being the shape your space wants you to be, and her voice closed around the last words as if the thought had grown too large for her mouth.

Tallulah listened in the way of a person who has learned to pause before exploding because she has grown tired of cleaning up shards. She liked the kid on the bike because he did not perform being fearless; he only was on the way to something else. She liked the woman who admitted to being tired because tired is a confession and confessions are rare in daylight. She looked at the bridge and discovered that its cables were singing in the same key as the station behind the exploding corn, which amused her for reasons she did not intend to share. She wanted to step forward and say I am listening and knew that would ruin the listening. She wanted to hide and knew that would make her blog light up with men who use the word coward like a seasoning. She did neither. She stayed where the shade made a square on her arm and thought about the resistor on the window and the way it had looked like a little mountain, and she thought about climbing and about how she had stopped doing it not because she had become big but because she had become large in a way that told ladders not to trust her.

Leticia felt the hum change by a hair and knew the bridge’s mood had shifted from expectant to alive. She did nothing because sometimes the best intervention is the kind you leave in your bag. Manny moved twice and stopped himself once from stepping toward a woman who tripped on a paint line because she caught herself and did not need elevation to be prevented by a stranger in a ball cap. He passed his towel to a child whose soda had gone open at the wrong angle and the child frowned like a king being offered tribute and then used it anyway and handed it back with a gratitude he would disguise later with a new swagger he would practice in the alley with his friends.

The meeting ended by dissolving rather than concluding, which is the safest way for events without microphones to stop. People went home with the feeling of having participated in something too small for their grandchildren to hear about, and that was a blessing because smallness asks nothing from a legacy. Tallulah left last because leaving first is punctuating a sentence you haven’t finished, and as she went she drew one loop on the concrete with the toe of her shoe and then scuffed it away and no one saw and that was how she wanted it. Leticia stayed until the shade had moved a foot and could feel, through the soles of her boots, the vibration of trucks on the near highway, and she thought, half-hysterically and half scientifically, that if you could teach the whole city to tap the same foot at the same time you might be able to knock something loose that had been stuck since before anyone alive had been born.

That night, the quiet station behind the feed mill did not hum quite right, and Leticia could tell by the way the numbers wrote their song that someone had placed a hand on the instrument and pressed. She drove out with the smaller metronome, annoyed at the way her body had begun to respond to the click of her keys like a dog hearing the rattle of a leash, and Manny went because the night does strange things to math. When they got there the air had that weird quality of a place where something allows itself to be seen only by the person who will not give it away. The fence felt warmer than it should, a heat not from sun but from attention, and the transformer sounded as if it were embarrassed by being looked at. Leticia cocked her head and half-closed one eye and felt the shape of it in her jaw and laughed without smiling. “She tuned it,” she said. “She tuned it to me.”

Manny made a face like a man who has just discovered a friend left him a gift on his porch with no note and no return address. “Is this good,” he asked, “or is this the thing before the bad thing.”

Leticia adjusted the dial on the small box and moved her hand over the casing like a priest pretending he still believes in sacraments so the people will remember how. She sent a whisper, not to change the pitch but to make a shape inside the song that would be recognizable to exactly one person. She sent no blood. She sent no threat. She sent the word she could not put in her mother’s mouth without making the house feel too full, the word that says stay. Then she turned off the device and put it back in the bag and they stood and listened to a machine breathe in the dark because sometimes that is the only way not to imagine it breathing out a thing you are not ready to name.

At three in the morning, a message arrived on the pendant that had seen more of her neck than any hand had in years, and Tallulah read it twice and did not know whether it had been meant for her or for the city. It said, in a lowercase that had become a habit and a wound, that someone had added a rhythm she could follow if she wanted to sleep. She looked at the ceiling of whatever she was calling home this month and thought about obedience and chose neither disobedience nor surrender, the way some people choose not to drink and not to quit coffee on the same Wednesday. She closed her eyes and tried to find the new shape in the hum, and when she found it, she kept it a secret by refusing to smile.

Morning followed is how this city describes sunrise to itself when no one is listening. Victor’s daughter requested a ride to a lab, and he drove like a man who had slept three hours and lived ten, and when she got out she looked at him and said without looking as if the words were afraid of being seen, “You’re doing a thing,” and he said back equally not looking, “So are you,” and they both did not cry because the day did not deserve the dignity. Ruth weeded around the plant she had given and yelled at a squirrel because it had decided to dig in the exact place she had told herself she would not invest more love. Rima bought ice and set it in a bowl because when grief is a guest you should give it something that melts to look at. Leticia wiped the resistor symbol from her window with the gentleness of someone cleaning a body that is not theirs and knows they must do it with respect or the dead will talk in their ear for a week. The smudge resisted and then surrendered, leaving a faint line of oil that would announce itself in certain light like a secret tattoo.

By afternoon, the city had learned the shape of this chapter and, like all novels in progress, decided to misbehave. A warehouse went dark in a way that did not belong to anyone, and three barbers had to finish haircuts with the doors open and talk louder than usual because the clippers could not do the work of conversation. A woman tested the edge of a thought about leaving and then stopped because leaving is expensive and staying is, too. The kid with the BMX built a ramp out of two pallets and a sheet of plywood and made a show of not showing off, and when he fell he laughed with his mouth closed and then swore softly into his sleeve because he had learned to be kind to ears that did not belong to him. The transformer at the quiet station purred the new pitch and a fox trotted along the fence line as if an invitation had been issued and declined with grace. Tallulah stood on an overpass and watched cars pass under her like blood, and for a minute she thought about the fact that she had not frightened anyone for hours and registered the way that realization tasted like a spice she did not use because it belonged to someone else’s kitchen.

By the time evening settled into its chair, a thing had been put in motion that no one with a title had planned. The women who had been reading without speaking began to place index cards in the windows facing the street with a single mark on them, a little line in the shape of the resistor, drawn badly by some and expertly by one or two who had taken physics and remembered. They did it for each other more than for her, a lemon against a sore throat, a code that meant I will hum off-key with you if we need to. Leticia saw the first one on a block where nobody’s garbage cans matched and the second in a building where the elevator never stopped when you pressed five, and by the third she felt the city do that secret realignment grids do when too many small loads shift and someone has to recalculate because the math doesn’t care why, only that it has been altered. She wanted to be the person who didn’t cry at cardboard, and she failed disappointingly fast and then wiped her face with the back of the hand that had touched so many machines that day it had forgotten it was also allowed to touch her own cheek.

There is a kind of calm that happens in cities when chaos tires itself out and practicality takes a lap. That calm arrived efficient and unadorned. Tallulah stood in it and let it work on her like a hand that knows what part of a back to press to make a different muscle relax. She thought of Jo’s piano and Mari’s pennies and Lila’s sentence in the closet and wondered, with a detachment that was new and not entirely unpleasant, what would have happened if she had learned boredom earlier. She would not have become small; that was a lie she refused to entertain. But perhaps the blog would have filled with photographs of rivers and the breasts of buildings rather than the parts of women’s lives where fear goes to hide. It was a hypothesis she knew she would not test because experiments require consent from all parties and that was a respect she had given up on a year ago and was only now, reluctantly, reacquiring.

Before midnight, Leticia and Manny took the truck out once more because one of the fences had thrown a number that wanted accompaniment. They parked under a light that buzzed the way lights do when no one has told them they are irritating, and they tuned without speaking, the practiced handoffs of tools between people who have learned to stand far enough apart that their elbows do not lie to one another. When they finished, Manny leaned against the bumper and exhaled something that might once have been a prayer and then when he saw her looking at him as if she had caught him with his hand in a cookie jar he shrugged in a way that said a man is allowed to breathe to the sky, and she let him have it without a joke. She looked up instead of down for once, and the stars looked back like old friends you don’t mind not impressing, and the hum underfoot took a key she recognized as close to contentment, and she put her hand on the truck as if to ground herself and then burst out laughing because she realized she was literally grounding herself and the joke wasn’t even good and it still landed because the day had been kind.

When the night finally admitted to being tired, when the blogs that had treated themselves like altars shut their doors to the anonymous because the mods needed to sleep, when the last bus made the little sound it makes before it goes to bed, Tallulah wrote one more paragraph and posted it without reading it back. She said that she had not been gentle because gentle had been taught to her as a synonym for go away, and she was learning a different definition and did not know yet what would be required of her to earn it. She said that sometimes she wanted to ask someone to hum at her the way a mother hums at an animal she is trying to coax out from under a porch, and that today someone had, and she had hated it and also not hated it and both were true despite the way the world insists those options are mutually exclusive. She did not sign it because she never did, and still the city took the words like a pill and washed them down with a little water and lay on its side in a brief mimicry of sleep.Chapter 10

By the time the heat advisory stitched itself across the bottom of every screen like an unhelpful prayer, the resistor cards had multiplied into a quiet language. They showed up on porch windows and convenience store coolers and in the narrow pane beside the door of a manicure place that had survived three owners and one divorce, the little zigzag sometimes neat as a diagram, sometimes child-wobbly and earnest, sometimes made with tape because markers had proven treacherous on slick glass. The city noticed the way a body notices a cut by touching it again and again to see if it still hurts. Leticia noticed because the load shape in the afternoon shifted by a percentage small enough to be a rounding error and large enough to make the models clear their throats. “Someone’s turning off something at the same time,” she said, pencil tapping, and Manny, who was watching a fly attempt an education against the window, grunted in that way of his that means both plausible and I will build a shelf for whatever follows.

Victor noticed because phone calls came soft at first and then impatient, voices wanting someone sanctioned to explain what the symbol meant and whether it was a plot and whether the utility had an opinion on the kinds of plots women invented together when no one had assigned them a meeting. He said words like load management and demand response and did not say words like grief and patience because his job did not allow him to say those until he was two beers into a backyard conversation with exactly the right neighbor. He put an X through a line on a map with a kind of tenderness, and the engineer with the wedding ring twitched the ring and said, “She’s humming where it matters,” and Victor nodded because he had learned when to give another man credit for hearing without having to be told what to listen for.

Rima sat on her apartment floor with a map of the city drawn on butcher paper and laid her phone on intersections like she was making offerings. She had decided not to write anything for the day because she could feel the appetite of the story wanting to be fed and she did not always enjoy being the one who cooked for its hunger. Around her, the walls did their end-of-summer expansion with small clucks, a building learning to be big in heat and then remembering it would have to be humble when the cold came. She let the map tell her where to go at dusk and made a list of the names of bridges in the margins because names are how you trick chaos into behaving as if it had RSVPed.

Tallulah woke to a sky the color of bleached denim and the unpleasant discovery that she had dreamed she could fit into a chair that had belonged to someone else. The memory of trying to sit in a thing that could not hold her made her laugh without softness, a bark her own ears did not enjoy. She wrote something small for her girls that was not knives because the morning did not deserve to be cut open just yet. hello girls. the air tastes like doorknobs today. someone is drawing mountains on their windows. i can see them from rooftops when the light hits. they look like teeth and like stitches. if you are making a map, be kind to your own house. She did not scroll further down than three replies because the fourth always contained a man’s ache disguised as wit and she was not interested in feeding that part of the city before she fed herself.

The city offered work because it had to. A municipal lot coughed and coughed and then remembered how to breathe, and a line on the south side took a load it had not trained for and dropped it like a wrestler who had overestimated his own narrative. Leticia rewrote a set point and watched a relay accept it with the petulance of a machine that had expected to be left alone today. She had slept four hours and dreamed in blueprints, and when she put her hand on the case to center herself she left the faint oval of sweat that machines will ignore until they corrode and then blame you for it. Manny ate a bolillo with watermelon sliced into cubes inside the pulled bread because his cousin had sworn it was a thing and because heat makes men receptive to odd inventions, and he handed a piece to Leticia without looking up from the printout he was holding upside down because he reads numbers the way other men read faces.

Midday brought a visitor dressed like a warning and a compliment at once. The shirt was agency-blue and the badge had been designed by someone who believed fonts could make authority pretend to be your friend, and the woman who wore both introduced herself as Teresa with the kind of nod that implied she had no last name until such time as she decided you deserved it. She carried a folder that had the lightness of many copies of the oldest request; she placed it on the workbench and said, in a tone that had learned to be brisk to compensate for the years when no one took such a tone seriously, “Department of Energy is curious, Homeland is nervous, Public Utilities Commission is prepared to be offended. They want to know if what you’re doing counts as a device.”

Leticia sipped warm water in the hope of persuading it to feel like tea. “A device is a hammer,” she said, rolling the empty bottle in her palm like a wheel she could pretend would carry her out of the conversation. “This is a metronome. If they want to call it a weapon they will, but then I want to see who they decide the enemy is, and I want them to write it down because writing makes men respect the words they throw in public since it means their mothers might see them.”

Teresa did not smile because she was storing up all her smiles for later when she could give them to people who had not earned them with threat. “There will be a hearing,” she said. “They will try to make you define intention. They will attempt to file your indignation under personality. If you let them, they will take your work and give it a new name and you will wake up a consultant with no Sundays. I am here to suggest you insist on calling it choreography. They do not know what to do with dance.”

Manny, who had been quiet because as a rule he saved his words for when they would be important, said around a mouthful, “Bring fritters to the hearing,” and Teresa glanced at him, eyebrows lifting, and then nodded, apparently making a mental note to requisition pastry because sometimes strategy comes salted with jokes. She stayed thirty minutes and did not touch anything on the bench even when her hand hovered over a coil with an attraction that felt like recognition. Before she left she stood in the big doorway with her face turned toward the heat and said, “She was seen near a wind farm last week. Out by the turbines where the cows look like doubt from that distance. If you needed to know if she was trying to hear something bigger than your grid, you know now.”

The wind farm lived in a story that liked to tell itself as progress, white turbines lifting their arms with that languid grace that can disguise the power needed to move anything consistently. Tallulah had walked there in the night the way a person walks toward a memory they have decided to test against current fact, her feet slow enough to let insects make their choices and quick enough to allow her to pretend she did not care about the decisions of ants. The towers sang the way bottles sing when a child blows across them, low and sweet and a little ridiculous if you let yourself accept that ridiculous is only another face of awe. She stood under a blade that passed like a temper and listened to a song that did not need her and therefore did not flatter her, a relief like eating bread that you did not bake and being grateful without claiming it made you a baker.

She had thought, standing with her hand against the column, that this was what forgetting felt like if you did it correctly: not absence, not ignorance, but a space where your own noise had to yield. She did not write about it because she did not want the wind turned into commentary by men who would arrive on bicycles and tell her how efficient the thing was at turning one kind of story into another. She took a photograph anyway, her hand a dark smudge against the pale longing of the tower, and stored it in her own head as if there were a shelf somewhere that held jars labeled Not For Sharing.

Back in the city, a megachurch made a plan to wrest meaning back from a week it had failed to headline. The pastor had a voice like a good microphone and hands that could convince you they were definitely not empty when they were, and his staff arranged portable speakers along a parking lot because parking lots are where modern faith tests its acoustics. They called it a night of deliverance from fear and sent men with clipboards to arrange ushers who would believe themselves bouncers if given the chance. The flyer shouted the name of a band that had four electric guitars and a keyboard determined to be brave, and under it in a smaller font asked women to come with a friend because safety always likes to be marketed as fellowship. The draw of such an event was its capacity to metabolize; it would eat worry and put out the smoke of community, and the electrical panel did not care about metaphors, it only cared about the amps.

Victor’s phone pinged with the permit request and he did the trick of a man who has learned how to say yes while routing wires away from harm, granting the draw but reassigning a nearby line to shoulder some of the burden. He called Leticia with the numbers and then called the hospital in the older part of town whose backup had fussed last week during a storm and told them to do a maintenance run on the generator at six-thirty, a precaution that would cost them an hour of fuel today and possibly a life in reputation points later when a board member wanted to know why anyone had done anything without a memo. He did this because he had been taught by the evening under the levee that boredom and planning might save him a fire.

Leticia listened to the schedule and adjusted her breath to the shape of it. She hated churches in exactly the way that someone raised in their shadow does, which is to say with expertise and tenderness and a kind of betrayal that tasted almost like nostalgia, because the hands that had fed her had also sometimes padded their own pride with scripture while telling her she was small. She had no interest in interfering with anyone’s music unless the speakers became a mouth that tried to eat the grid she needed steady. She made three new boxes with alligator clips that could bite into a line quickly and tell her what she needed to know without boasting about it, and Manny labeled them with names of obscure saints he had learned at a construction site where the foreman believed a theology degree made him qualified to talk about studs.

Rima took audio equipment to the church lot but set up across the street because she did not want to be part of the show even as a critic. She wired a small recorder under a lamppost that had been scuffed by many nights of tires too close and fights too bored, and she wrote in her notebook words like wave and choir and feedback loop with arrows between them as if drawing might make the muscle memory of the grid instructive. She had a sense, not yet a story, that the night wanted to teach the city the difference between a sound made to be heard and a sound made to be felt.

At seven everyone hummed by accident and then, because accident felt good, on purpose. It started on a block where women with index cards decided to risk letting their neighbors see their mouths make a shape that might be mocked, and then it migrated across the two streets that define that part of town as almost dangerous but still gentrifiable, and then it moved into a building where the elevator had never stopped when you asked it to and persisted anyway. Perhaps thirty people hummed at first, and then a hundred, and then math did the thing it always does when you reach the threshold where the pattern becomes discernible. The sound was not beautiful, not at the start, the kind of ugliness a chorus makes in its first rehearsal that drives the director to question his decision to be here at all and then subsides into something he will later call promise as if he had invented the word.

Manny stepped outside the warehouse and leaned his shoulder into the brick because he had learned it would remember him and therefore hold him differently. He hummed, off-key on purpose because holding a light is a different skill from singing the correct note, and when Leticia laughed at the sound it moved into the hum like a bell someone drops in a bucket of water: changed but useful. She put her palm on the metronome and did not turn it on, letting it take the warmth of her hand as if that were a tuning. Teresa stood outside her car in a cul-de-sac that had been promised sidewalks three times and smiled without meaning to and hummed one phrase that belonged to her grandmother and then felt a little foolish and then felt less, which is the same thing and not at all.

The church band arrived at the second chorus of their second song, and their speakers sang their square wave into the evening air as if tone could be shaped into a tent and people could sit under it without asking if there were a permit. The amps drew power and the lights did their flattery and the sound, powerful and professional, went hunting for a quieter sound to boss. It found the hum of a hundred throats and sat on it for a second like a larger child in a game, and then the hum did not stop. The men with clipboards looked around for the source of the noise they had not sanctioned and found only many mouths, none open very wide, none willing to apologize for taking up air. The pastor adjusted his message on the fly as good pastors do and pivoted away from deliverance toward the language of unity, because it is easier to sell unity if you can call it your idea when it arrives.

Tallulah did not go to the church because she disliked being cast as an antagonist in a play where no one had asked if she wanted the role, even when it was fun to watch the lighting cues fail. She listened from somewhere that was not far, though, because distance is different when your head sticks up over the parts of town the helicopter has memorized. She sat on the edge of an old stadium where seats still held the smell of summer evenings and a thousand disappointed men, and she let the hum reach her like a tide too small to wash anything away and big enough to be called a body. She had the thought, as impolite to herself as it was novel, that this was what she had wanted and not known: not to dominate the story but to be surrounded by it without being dissolved. The thought did not turn her into anyone’s version of gentle. It did not change the size of her hands. It did, for several minutes that no one timed, take away the sudden spike behind her teeth that made breaking seem like answering.

Later, the grid made a more ordinary kind of demand. The heat accumulated behind a line that had been deferred in the budget five times, and the load on a feeder that serviced both a strip of bars and a small clinic approached the point where engineers write emails and managers say phrases like optics and then someone loses his job because a blind number had won. Victor called Leticia and inhaled to apologize before speaking and then did not apologize because there was no time. “We need five percent off that loop,” he said. “I can buy us two with the switch, one with the beer signs if the owners will answer a phone, and two if your fences can convince the line to not love the load as much as it thinks it does right this minute.”

“Don’t touch the clinic,” Leticia said, and she let her voice put on its jacket with elbow patches, the professor she had killed to survive showing up with a pointer. “Take the dry cleaner. They will complain tomorrow when the stacks are late but their girls will get to go home early. Hit the nail salon for three minutes; I will send them cash for tips later. Put a man with a badge at the corner where the bar owner will step out and make faces so he can make them at the badge instead of you. I can give you two on the loop if I paint the buzz dirty. It will make the compressors think the party’s over.”

She did it in a way that would not make the compressors angry tomorrow and resentful for a week. The metronome’s wave went out subtle as breath held for a photograph, and the line listened the way old men listen when a younger man tells them a story about the war they weren’t in. The beer signs flickered and the customers howled good-naturedly because howling at a light is one of the last rituals that belongs to all men, and the clinic’s monitors did not notice anything more than the usual weather of an old building. The bar owner stepped onto the sidewalk with a performative indignation and saw the badge and aimed his gestures at it, and the officer on loan remembered training that told him how to be a canvas for someone else’s paint.

In the quiet that followed the averting of embarrassment, Tallulah took her own small risk. She walked onto a closed ramp that lifted itself like a question over the freeway and used both hands to gather a regiment of bright orange cones. She arranged them into a resistor the size of a bus, a warning drawn in a child’s library of shapes, and she laughed when a driver on the access road saw it and honked not in anger but in reflex admiration for a rectangle that had left the world of rectangles and become a thing you could understand immediately without agreeing with. A helicopter came and then left because no one was bleeding, and the men at the church lot posted blurry photographs and the women in the windows drew their little zigzags a little darker.

Ruth arrived at Leticia’s with salsa that announced its intentions before the bag hit the table and three tomatoes that had held onto their green shoulders just to be fashionable. She wore a hat that was trying to be brave and told Manny he looked like he needed to eat something that had met a river recently, then told Leticia she was not eating enough bread with her eggs regardless of what her mother texted. She looked at the resistor streak on the window that Leticia had left as a ghost after the wipe and made a tsk without censure. “I like that you keep it,” she said. “It makes the glass honest.”

They ate until their mouths went numb and then found the feeling again. Manny told Ruth about the boy with the drone without telling her he had wanted to throw it into the river, and Ruth admitted she had always wanted to learn to fly one as a way to spy on the neighbor who had put his grill too close to her fence and melted a patch of her careful world. They laughed at the crime and then did not say the other crimes out loud because good company has a way of making you feel like you can hold your tongue and still be known. In the corner the metronome at rest looked like a loaf of bread that would never forgive you for slicing it wrong, and Leticia put a dish towel over it because affection is sometimes act and sometimes cover.

Night tried to be big again but found itself competing with the memory of humans deciding to hum, and that is a formidable rival. The temperature stayed high and the sound of air conditioners settled into a relationship with the grid that could be called love only by someone who had never experienced love as anything other than a steady thing that sometimes hurts. Victor drank a glass of water on his back step and watched the space beyond the fence where he liked to pretend a coyote might walk if the city ever forgot what it was, and his daughter texted him a photograph of a lab apparatus that had done what it was supposed to do with the caption: it resists if you ask nicely, and he laughed alone and felt less alone for a minute.

Just before midnight, a station that had behaved all week behaved as if it had been spoken to. Leticia sat up on her couch with the reflex of someone who had decided to answer the phone even if it did not ring. She saw the number swing and knew it was not failure so much as flirtation. “She’s awake,” she said, and Manny, who had discovered that he could fall asleep in any chair if holding a light had been his job that day, stood up like a man answering a door he had not knocked on. They drove the loop through the sleeping industrial park that always looked like it had just been built and had not yet been told how it would be used and found the fence warm again with attention. The hum had a shape in it that was neither threat nor invitation; it was a word written on the inside of a mouth.

“She tuned this one to my name,” Leticia said, and the words were ridiculous and correct at once. The pitch had a nick in it that matched the way she had laughed weeks ago in front of a transformer without meaning to, and she hated and loved that someone had listened closely enough to hear that. She took the small device and set it on the cinderblock where graffiti had insisted once on the existence of a man named Luisio who had probably moved two towns over. She did not turn the dial. She just placed her hand on the casing and let the heat of her skin argue with the heat of the night.

Across town, on a roof that had acquired a groove where her body had made a habit of lying down, Tallulah lay on her back and allowed herself four slow inhales with the ambition of making room for something that did not want to enter if offered an open door. The hum under her changed by the smallest fraction and she recognized the shape because she had put it there: a curlicue in the line that said I have been listening too. She did not publish because letting others know she had recognized the compliment would let them claim ownership of a moment that belonged to no one. Instead she drew a small resistor on the edge of the roof with a bit of chalk she kept in a pocket for no reason she had ever admitted, and then she rubbed it away with her palm and lay watching the chalk dust climb and then fall like a small weather, an atmosphere of her own making that harmed nothing and no one.

The hearing happened in a room that had not been designed to hold the amount of earnestness it was forced to accommodate. The dais wore nameplates that had been polished by someone who probably did the job better than anyone in the room knew, and microphones blinked their readiness like birds trained to sing on cue. Teresa sat behind Leticia and wore a jacket that apologized to no one, and Victor took a seat like a man prepared to be interrupted. Manny stood at the back with a thermos of coffee and a bag that rattled like hardware and admired the fire extinguisher for being brave and bored. The first question came wrapped as compliment, the sort that invites you to dance and then complains about the music. “Doctor Salgado,” a man said, giving her the title as if he were handing her a glass too full and daring her not to spill, “is it your intention to manipulate public utilities for private… goals.”

“My goal,” Leticia said, and the room had to lean forward to catch the accent because it had failed to expect it and that was the room’s mistake, “is public. The word utility is not a person. It is the name we give to the way a city delivers a thing everyone needs. If you are asking me if I have an intention, I do. I intend to make the grid an inhospitable instrument for a very large woman who uses it as a choir and a mirror. I intend to do that without killing anyone’s air conditioning and without asking a NICU to be brave. You can call that private if you are not used to women having intentions. I call it good wiring.”

A murmur moved, polite as a congregation and charged like a fence. The questions that followed wore different hats and the same hair, and Teresa watched Leticia choose which ones to answer and which to look at until they looked away. Someone tried to make a metaphor about floodgates and Leticia, with less patience than she had been granted by breakfast, said, “You do not get to do water here to avoid saying power. We are doing electricity. Say it and then I will explain why metaphor is for journalists and what I am building is for lineworkers.”

The doughnuts, when they arrived, were not fritters and Manny declared this a sin under his breath and then took two because forgiveness begins at home. Victor spoke when spoken to and once when not, and on that once he said, “If you prohibit her we will still have a giant and we will have fewer tools,” and the chair of the commission, who had hair that had already decided to be white and a gaze that had decided to be kind, nodded because the sentence had the shape of something he would like to quote later.

No one left the hearing believing they had been transformed, which is to say it went as well as such things can when the subject is a machine that hums and a woman who has decided to put her hand on it. Teresa texted a single word later—decent—and a location, and Leticia arrived at the bar without televisions and accepted the drink she didn’t want to finish because thirst is often the wrong reason to be in a room. Teresa said, “They will try to seduce your devices away from you and then claim you gave consent,” and Leticia said, “I will write my answers on copper if I have to,” and they sat for a while with the kind of silence that makes men nervous and women strong.

On the blog, a new current began, one that did not thrill the men who came for spectacle and left when tenderness arrived. Women posted photographs of the backs of their hands, the topographies of knuckles and scars and half-moons of paint; they captioned them with things they had made: a shelf, a bandage, a casserole that kept a woman alive for a week, a bridge drawn on a napkin that ended up being built without their name on it. Tallulah watched this choral exhibition of plainness and felt, for a half-second and then longer, something adjacent to jealousy but not powered by wanting. She typed and deleted twice. Then she wrote, hello girls. show me the thing you fixed that no one thanked you for. She pressed post and put the phone face down on concrete that had been a roof and a floor and a bed and a stage and God, today, maybe a bench.

The photographs poured in, a spill you could have drowned in if you didn’t know how to float. Door hinges and scraped knees and a child's understanding of long division taught at a kitchen table and a patch of wallpaper aligned by eye and a cracked bowl glued and used because throwing it away had felt like a betrayal of its service. Leticia did not submit a picture because she did not need to be thanked by the room, but she scrolled and let herself feel the specific pleasure of being in a place that had chosen to brag about utility. Manny peered over her shoulder at a hinge that had been rehung with a shim that was a library card and said, approving, “Good use of government,” and she laughed in a way that would have confused the man with the badge at the corner of the bar.

The heat snapped in the only way heat does here, not with mercy but with a different quality of oppression. The air tasted like reheated coins and the afternoon slid into evening with the regret of having forgotten to apologise for existing. A line failed in a place where the drawing had always assumed stability, and the lights went out in a row of stores that sold small joy to people who had little time for joy. The candles came out and the iceboxes got repacked and a man with a sternum tattoo tried to barter with a chocolatier and was told, with unnecessary gentleness, that now was not the hour for that kind of economy. Leticia’s fences took the surge that wanted to ripple and turned it into a wave that smacked a single pier and then died, and Rima, walking past a laundromat where women fairly begged machines to finish before the power gave up, decided to carry quarters forever because maybe sometimes money could be a form of mercy if you didn’t make a speech while giving it.

Tallulah stood on a balcony that had once held smoking diners and now held the air conditioners that kept the same diners indoors and she considered stepping onto the street for the pleasure of the shout and chose instead to sit on the rail like a cat that knows it is admired for balancing. She had learned enough boredom to understand that excitement can make you sick. She had learned enough to know that if she left town now, the city would write it as retreat, and if she stayed, it would write it as terror, and if she did anything at all, a third-party app would gamify it and send little badges to people who had named bumpers after her in their imagination. She found the new pitch in the hum and pushed it with her attention the way you push a memory to see if it will hold, and it held, and she lay back against the heat-warmed brick and said aloud to no one, “Stay,” and later would not admit the word had not tasted like chalk.

By morning the commission had proven itself useful by doing something small. They released a notice that declared the metronomes part of a pilot program with a name dull enough that no one would tweet it angrily, and they buried in the text a sentence that said community-demanded damping is a recognized phenomenon not subject to immediate regulation. Victor took the win and hid it in a drawer because there are victories you do not display unless you want them stolen. Teresa sent a second word—footing—and did not see the way Leticia, reading it, set her spine as if a ladder had been leaned against it and an electrical worker were about to climb.

The fathers with the shirts who had called themselves protectors refocused their dignity on the school zoning meeting when it turned out that fear of giants made for poorer schedules than fear of funding cuts. Their daughters rolled their eyes in synchrony because girls can harmonize better than men when duty requires it, and one of them wore a necklace with a little resistor charm 3D-printed by a boy who wanted to learn how to be useful and why that wasn’t the same as being admired. The kid on the BMX built a new ramp with better math and began teaching a friend to fall without believing it meant failure, and on the third spill he remembered not to laugh.

Ruth, who had been sensible all her life and therefore had been accused of meanness more than once, stood on Leticia’s porch with a jar full of cuttings that looked like patience and gossip and said, “I had a dream your metronome was a baby. It cried. I did not pick it up,” and Leticia laughed until she cried in the other direction and Manny came to the door and said, “I will be the godfather of copper if no one stops me,” and that was enough to make the day behave for an hour.

Tallulah posted a photograph of the wind farm without context and men began to teach the wind again, and women ignored them and wrote in the comments the names of the towns where they had observed rural silence behave differently than city quiet. One wrote that her aunt had called windmills sky cows and made cheese puns until the day she died, and for a few hours the thread contained only recipes and laughter like an old forum rediscovered. Tallulah watched the women feed each other and told herself she had hosted a potluck, and the pride that came with that thought did not make her want to smash anything and that was new enough to be almost frightening.

In the late afternoon, a woman no one in the story had mentioned yet did something ordinary and changed the texture of a corner of the city. She was a bus driver who had been driving her route long enough to know which guys would fall asleep by stop fourteen and which older ladies would make long eye contact like they were memorizing a face not because they were lonely but because the world sometimes requires witnesses. She saw a shape two blocks away and knew it meant either an interruption or a miracle and she closed the bus doors slowly and hummed a note she had learned in a choir when she was twelve and then not sung since because life had fed her different music. When the giant walked by the bus, the driver made no sign, and the two of them shared a second of nonconfrontation that was so precise it could have been art, and three passengers felt the air change and could not tell you why they thought later the day had been kinder to them than usual.

As the sun wrecked itself on a horizon that had always been patient with it, Leticia and Manny returned to the levee with no plan but a habit. The grass had learned foot shapes and kept them like a museum, and the river had decided today to perform its piece in a key that made the mosquitoes lazy. They set the new metronome where the old one had exhaled last and did not turn it on because it is healthy to discover if absence can do some of the work for you. Leticia lay on her back and let the small rocks under her shoulder write a map of countries she would never visit, and Manny counted planes with his eyes and told himself stories about destinations that did not require passports, just a sandwich and a flashlight.

Tallulah arrived late, if you count by schedules she had never consented to, and sat with more care than she would have afforded a night in June. She did not ask if the city would hum for her because she did not want to pretend she had not begun to understand that sometimes you sit with your back against an instrument and it hums because it exists and not because it loves you. She lay down with her face toward the sky, which had chosen to stripe itself purple for once like it remembered the eighties, and she did not close her eyes because closing her eyes made her a silhouette and silhouettes are easier to misuse. The hum did nothing heroic. It made the air a little forgiving. It held itself steady. She placed her hand on her own sternum and found the new shape the way a person finds a steady partner in a room full of dancers who would like a turn.

When she stood to leave she looked at Leticia for longer than a courtesy and then glanced at Manny, who raised the flashlight in the way he had learned, a half salute and half offering and entirely not brave. “Tomorrow,” she said, and her mouth found the smallest smile as if it were practicing being allowed to, “I will do nothing interesting at noon. Tell your men with ties to stay home and eat something sugary.” Leticia did not promise on behalf of men she did not own, and Manny said, “I will text Victor about pastry in the morning like a man who controls nothing and wants to feel like he does,” and she laughed in a way that made the railings at the top of the levee tremble and then held still so they would not fall.

The next day the giant kept her promise to be boring at noon, which meant a woman in a cubicle allowed herself to breathe normally at her desk and a man who had been waiting for a pretext to cry did not make one. The city noticed in the way it always does, by giving no reward other than an absence of punishment. Victor sent a photograph of an apple fritter to a group thread that did not exist until that second and which he did not name, and Teresa sent a thumbs up she would later deny, and Rima sent an audio clip of her building breathing, the sound so quiet that anyone not primed for intimacy would have thought their phone was broken. Ruth watered the plant she had rescued and told it not to get ideas about the world beyond the pot, then told herself the same in less scolding tones.

That evening, for reasons no one could agree on later, a flock of starlings chose to fly in embarrassed formation above a strip mall where a nail salon and a tax preparer and a pawn shop had made a peace treaty long ago. The birds made their mistakes beautifully and the murmuration swelled and shrank with the kind of logic that makes men say algorithm because they are afraid to say beauty. Tallulah watched without moving because there are things you ruin by applauding. Leticia watched from a parking space where someone had drawn two lines too close together, and Manny watched from the back of the truck with his ankles crossed and the look of a man who had lost and found several fathers and decided to be his own. The birds did not care about the grid or about the men with badges or the women with humming in their mouths. They cared about not being alone in the air, and when they finished, the sky looked like it had learned a new word and was practicing using it in a sentence before class.

The blog sat quiet for a longer interval than usual and then woke with a paragraph that was not knives. hello girls. i know i have been your weather. today i let other things do the work. i am considering the possibility that boredom is a form of safety i never learned. i am not promising. my hands still remember everything. but i am thinking about your hands and the hinges and the pennies and the wallpaper and the doors you made swing true. if tomorrow i post a photograph of the river and nothing else you will understand that it is a sentence. It was not an apology. It was not not one. It was the kind of sentence a city reads and chooses to behave for a few hours because the woman who has been cruel has decided to test whether she can be less so, and that is, if nothing else, spectacularly interesting.

Night came with its sleeves rolled up and the hum held. The resistor cards did not come down. The metronomes did not need new names. The hearing found a minute to breathe in the record books because no one said anything so stupid it had to be quoted later in a thread designed to humiliate, and that alone felt like a miracle stitched from polyester and prayer. Leticia fell asleep on the couch with a pencil uncapped in her hand and did not wake with ink on her face because the gods of small mercies were not bored yet. Manny dreamed of ladders that adjusted their own angles to spines, and in the morning he told no one because some dreams are not meant to be shared even if telling them would win you a better story. The city did what it always does when given a chance: it surprised itself by behaving, and then, because it is not a person and cannot be flattered, it went back to being a grid and a hum and a map and a thousand small hands, and all those hands kept working because they were small and the work was not.
