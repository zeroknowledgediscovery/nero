     "novel_text": "The gulls started before the sun, and the cutlery came after. Forks slipped into their compartments like slim silver fishes. Steam rose from the industrial dishwasher and kissed the peeling lemon paint on the kitchen walls of The Driftwood Caf\u00e9, an old Victorian tearoom tucked just off Eastbourne pier, where the pier planks creaked to their own rhythm and tourists came with their pastel trousers and their bright hopes for scones.\n\nMaisie Linton wiped her hands with a towel that had seen better summers and better tea spills, and hummed beneath the clatter. She always hummed when she was moving, when she was balancing three plates on one arm and there was an order for two bacon sandwiches, one without bacon. There was a space in her head that music knew how to fill, even in the narrow corridor between coffee machine and condensed milk tins.\n\nHer voice, when not muffled by steam and steel, could float, could surprise strangers into glancing up from their tea. Today, at eight-fifteen, she murmured the chorus of a song she pretended had no owner, just to see how the vowels tasted when they left. A little note perched on the rim of her mouth, like a gull on a cement post, and then flew.\n\n\u201cSave the opera for the Sunday lot,\u201d said Mrs. Pike, adjusting her glasses and peering through her own reflection in the pastry display. She kept her hair in a bun that had become an institution. \u201cWe\u2019ve barely any scones left as it is. They\u2019ll think there\u2019s some kind of performance and stay for lunch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m singing to the jam tarts,\u201d Maisie said. It came out vaguely Northern, the original tracing that years in Sussex hadn\u2019t ironed away. \u201cThey\u2019re drooping.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re raspberry,\u201d said Mrs. Pike, as if that answered anything. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget table nine, the lady with the terrible hat. She\u2019ll want a new fork; she always does.\u201d\n\n\u201cTable nine already got a fork,\u201d said Jai, sliding in with a tray like a ship into harbour. He wore an apron with a splash of coffee that had become part of the pattern. He had a manner of talking that kept a beat. \u201cAnd then she asked for something without gluten or guilt, and I said, \u2018We\u2019ve got air.\u2019\u201d\n\nMaisie laughed, and the steam slipped down her throat with her laughter. She reached for a cup, and then the bell above the caf\u00e9 door chimed its tinny, real-world version of bells that would, in a few months, seem like a different kind of stage cue.\n\nOutside, the sea did its reliable thing. The promenade carried dogs, joggers, elderly couples carrying memory like a careful parcel. The chalk cliffs sprawled to the west as if a giant had left a slice of cake out in weather. The pier extended its gaudy bones into the water, carrying arcades and teenagers and chipped paint and the occasional wedding photographer like a seagull with a camera.\n\n\u201cTable three needs you,\u201d Jai said. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones with questions. From London, obviously. They want to know if we do almond milk that\u2019s been\u2026 ethically serenaded.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf almond milk doesn\u2019t get at least a lullaby, it curdles,\u201d Maisie said. She gathered the menu, tucked it under her arm, and plastered on the smile that was both natural and armour. The Driftwood taught her that a smile could be both a spoon and a shield.\n\nThe couple at table three had matching fleeces and matching anxieties about dairy. The man pointed at the sea as if it had just arrived on the menu. \u201cIs that where the\u2026 what do you call it\u2026 Beachy Head is?\u201d he asked, one hand on his flat white, the other fluttering. \u201cI read about it on the internet. It looks very high. Are there steps?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are steps, of a sort,\u201d Maisie said, because it was easier to lie about cliffs than to talk about heights and what they mean to some people. \u201cBut you want to walk the long way if it\u2019s windy. The wind there has opinions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about the almond milk?\u201d the woman asked, soft voice, polite. \u201cI mean, if not almond, oat is fine, but not the sort that separates because then I think I\u2019m drinking something\u2026 else.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have oat that behaves like a gentleman,\u201d said Maisie. \u201cAnd coconut that\u2019s not too forward.\u201d\n\nThey laughed, and it felt good, like catching a ball you\u2019d thrown and expecting to miss. She walked back towards the machine and set the dials and thought of how she would have said it if she were standing with a microphone under lights that turned everything into a halo. The days when she came back from the bar with two pints and a lemon wedge, she\u2019d picture a panel, bright teeth and complicated hair and the kind of comments that came in millions. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just good caf\u00e9 banter, Maisie,\u201d someone would say. \u201cYou\u2019ve transformed oat milk.\u201d And she\u2019d grin and make something of it, because that was the plan. That was always the plan.\n\n\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Jai asked, bumping her hip gently. He knew when a cloud had drifted across her face. He knew the forecast.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d she lied. \u201cEverything. A little song I haven\u2019t finished. Or maybe I have.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should finish it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should finish all of them. And you should get out of here before Mrs. P gives you the tea towel award for most plates carried without breathing.\u201d\n\nMrs. Pike, polished the glass with a cloth that must have been older than Maisie. \u201cThe tea towel award is a serious honour,\u201d she said. \u201cNot like them programmes.\u201d She said \u201cprogrammes\u201d the way other people said \u201cplagues\u201d or \u201cdishes left overnight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Maisie, and then an elderly man at table nine tapped his teaspoon with a precise rhythm, as if imitating the second hand of a clock. \u201cWe deliver time too, now?\u201d she murmured.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d said Mrs. Pike, not unkindly, \u201care going to have to install a second pair of legs.\u201d\n\nThey danced around each other the way people who share space learn to, moving in a choreography that has nothing to do with music and everything to do with the dimensions of a room. It was a good morning; it would be a long day; it would be a good day because of that.\n\nAt eleven, as sun finally decided to test itself against the low cloud, a boy with a skateboard came through the door and almost brought a small terrier with him. The terrier was the kind that looks like it has opinions and has done since the first second it breathed air. Its paws made a clatter on the tiled floor, its lead a whip.\n\n\u201cNo dogs,\u201d Mrs. Pike began, on autopilot with a human voice.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just visiting the scones,\u201d the boy said, hair in his eyes, rolling the board up under one arm. \u201cWe\u2019re picking up, not staying.\u201d\n\nThe terrier looked at Maisie as if she were a person who had promised something and not delivered.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m visiting the scones too,\u201d she told it. \u201cDon\u2019t make me regret it.\u201d\n\nThe dog huffed. The dog had a huff that would be known in other chapters, though no one is granted that kind of foreknowledge and wouldn\u2019t know what to do with it if they were. The boy apologised in a way that wasn\u2019t yet learned, and the dog tugged, and the bell chimed tinny, and the sea kept its own time of breathing and breathing again.\n\nBy the time the lunch rush approached, she had served five teas, six coffees, an argument about egg mayonnaise and whose grandmother made it better, and a woman wearing a hat that could have been a small garden. She refilled water jug after water jug and decided she liked the new glasses that made all water look like a thing freshly invented.\n\nShe loved the days when she could see the horizon out of the corner of her eye. The days she couldn\u2019t \u2014 when the dream clanged inside her like a loose pipe and the reality of carry-and-smile, smile-and-carry, took up that space \u2014 at least had the consolation of coins in the tip jar, and the occasional compliment like small cash for the heart. \u201cYou\u2019ve a lovely voice,\u201d someone had once said as she sang absently with the radio while scrubbing the coffee nozzle. She\u2019d smiled then and said thank you, because you accept that praise like you accept rain; you don\u2019t let on that rain is the thing that keeps everything alive.\n\nAfter her shift, the streets smelt faintly of caramelised sugar and cigarettes, and the wind had found its courage. The sea was a particular mood of blue, the sort of blue that postcards don\u2019t dare to print in case people get disappointed. She walked home along the front, shoes in her hand. She liked to feel the cold on the edges of her toes. She liked to think that she walked at the same speed as the water. A seagull made a noise like it had a throat full of stones. Somewhere a child cried, and somewhere a child laughed, and it was the same child, because that\u2019s how a seafront works.\n\nHer flat lived above a charity shop that never closed when you needed it and always did when you wanted a lamp for a tenner and a book someone had written their name in in 1972. The stairs were narrow and the paint peeled in strips like handwriting. Home was two rooms and a window that faced a brick wall beautifully, and it was, miraculously, exactly what she needed most days. She dumped her bag on the sofa and opened the window and let in the salt. She pulled the curtains apart and let in a sky that had changed its mind again.\n\nShe had two voicemails from her mother, who had a way of leaving messages like the sea left messages, everything half-said, the most important word washed away. One was about a plumber and how they never came when they said they would. The other was about a television programme involving shepherds that her mother could not stop thinking about. She would phone back later and say, \u201cPlumbers, eh?\u201d and \u201cShepherds exist in the future as well as the past,\u201d and her mother would laugh and tell her to stop being clever. They\u2019d talk about whether to put peas in a pasta salad, whether to renew the television licence themselves or by magic, and the space where they didn\u2019t talk would be filled with a humming noise that could have been contentment or fear.\n\nThere was also a missed call from an unknown number. The voicemail that followed was only half-present, as if the person leaving it was both in a studio and backstage in their own life. \u201cHi, is that Maisie Linton?\u201d said the voice. It had a bright professionalism that made every greeting sound like an invitation. \u201cThis is just an initial check-in call from\u2014\u201d The name blurred under the hiss from her phone speaker. \u201c\u2014if you could give us a ring back at your convenience. Thank you.\u201d\n\nShe stood with her thumb on the redial for a moment and then decided to ignore it until she had warmed her hands on a mug. It was the sort of call she pretended could be for anyone, which is to say, the sort of call she hoped was for her, which is to say, something that tasted of adrenaline and had a sugar afterburn. She made tea because tea didn\u2019t demand she be a different person. Tea just said, \u201cHere\u2019s water that\u2019s been changed in a clever way; you can have milk if you like.\u201d She sat on the arm of the sofa and counted the sounds of the street like counting breaths.\n\nLater, when the steam had died in the mug and her fingers were still warm, she called back and walked into the kitchen with the mosaic floor she\u2019d tried to fix with nail varnish. The voice that answered was bright in a bright building.\n\n\u201cHello, Maisie. I\u2019m Lorna,\u201d said the voice that had once tried to leave a name and dropped it. \u201cSorry for the mystery. You applied to our programme, back in May. You came to the regional audition in Brighton.\u201d\n\nIt was true. Brighton had been different. Brighton had felt like standing on a slightly different version of the planet, one that had tilted her towards the place she thought she was going. She had sung for ninety seconds under lights that turned her face into uppercase. A woman with hair like a plan had smiled at her and said, \u201cYou surprised me,\u201d and she had walked out feeling taller and then the feeling had smoothed itself into something else.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was\u2026 I wanted to thank everyone, then, but I didn\u2019t know if that was weird. Felt a bit like bringing flowers to a dentist.\u201d\n\nLorna laughed. \u201cWe like flowers,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd money and ratings, you know how it is. Listen, is this a good time? I have some news to talk through.\u201d\n\nMaisie sat on the countertop and watched a spider in the corner of the ceiling trying to decide whether to continue its web or go, \u201cYou know what, I\u2019ll move.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a fine time,\u201d she said, heart doing the thing it did when a plane flew low and the cups shook in the caf\u00e9.\n\n\u201cYou know the process is long,\u201d Lorna said. \u201cThere are lots of people and cameras and, frankly, chaos. But sometimes things happen that change the shape of things. We\u2019ve had a\u2026 we\u2019ve had an opening.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn opening,\u201d Maisie repeated. She tried the words on like a jacket she thought wouldn\u2019t fit. \u201cLike a window?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a window,\u201d said Lorna. \u201cLike someone who was supposed to be in the live final cannot be, for reasons outside our control.\u201d Her voice slalomed around the sentences, careful not to name names or reasons. \u201cWe have a shortlist of wildcards. People who didn\u2019t make it through in the expected way, but whom the team liked very much. You might be on that list.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou might,\u201d Maisie said, because her brain couldn\u2019t wrap itself around would or will. \u201cAre you saying you\u2019re asking me if I could be asked?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaisie,\u201d Lorna said, with a laugh that had warmth under the brightness. \u201cHow do you feel about London next week? How do you feel about coming to the studios and letting us put a camera in your face while you sing?\u201d\n\nThe kitchen did a small tilt. The window looked at the brick wall like a friend suddenly made interesting. Her heart made shapes. She stood because sitting didn\u2019t feel like a posture that matched the world.\n\n\u201cI feel like\u2014\u201d she started and laughed because the sentence was too big. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ll need to ask Mrs. Pike for the week off. She will tell me the tea towel awards wait for no woman. But yes. Yes. I feel yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear,\u201d said Lorna. \u201cWe\u2019ll confirm everything by email tonight. You\u2019ll have to come in two days early for fittings, a bit of PR, some digital content shoots, you know the drill. We\u2019ll have accommodation for you and a chaperone, and we\u2019ll talk about song choices. Are you\u2026 are you comfortable with, you know, the public bit? The eyes?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been practising with the oat milk,\u201d she said, and then blushed because some part of her brain had decided to staple her caf\u00e9 life to her future. \u201cI\u2019m okay. I want this. I want this like you wouldn\u2019t believe. But I also\u2014\u201d She swallowed something like crying. \u201cI can do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Lorna. \u201cBelieve. Also, tell someone you love who will remind you to sleep. It\u2019s\u2026 there\u2019s a lot of noise.\u201d\n\nAfter she hung up, the kitchen shrank and grew and shrank again, the way rooms do when the thing you\u2019ve been waiting for knocks very politely. She pressed both hands flat to the counter and then picked up her phone and stared at it like it should have become a different object. The light from the window had found a new angle. Her breath had become a thing you could see.\n\nShe didn\u2019t call her mother first. She put on her shoes and her coat and tucked her scarf around her like she was defending herself against gales that hadn\u2019t arrived. She walked back out into the late afternoon and the wind knocked her gently into herself. The cloud had moved to let the sun through, and every brick on the street said light, light, I am not dull, put me in a story. She turned right instead of left. She went uphill.\n\nHer great-uncle Len lived in a bungalow painted the colour of an egg in a storybook. The garden was mostly lawn, except for the strip at the back where he had considered growing veg and then decided the council did enough vegetables for everyone. The gate stuck in wet weather and sang in dry. Today it scraped with a sound like a man clearing his throat before speaking.\n\nLen was at the back door making tea, because he was always, in any given moment, at the back door making tea or about to be. He had grown small with time in the way that went unnoticed until someone who had known him long enough said, \u201cWhen did you shrink? Put you in the wash?\u201d\n\n\u201cLittle Lint,\u201d he said when he saw her. He had called her that since the day she\u2019d come home from school with someone else\u2019s glitter on her jumper. \u201cAre you here to tell me you\u2019ve married a prince or that you\u2019ve fallen off the pier and into a boat?\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth,\u201d she said. \u201cUncle, I think I\u2019m going to be on the telly.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinally,\u201d he said. He always said finally when she told him something that stunned her. He had a way of believing things in advance and then going on with making tea. He handed her the mug. \u201cWhat telly are we talking about? The kind where you bake, or the one where you dance, or the one where people lie to each other in a tropical way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe singing one,\u201d she said. \u201cThe one where my voice does the bit and my face has to pose and there are judges who have eyebrows that cost more than my rent.\u201d\n\n\u201cEyebrows are an industry now,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw them in a supplement. They cost and they have their own opinions.\u201d He gestured to the table. They sat. His kitchen was small and ridiculously clean, a habit of living alone after his wife had passed when you either let the dishes make a nest or you tidied like someone was coming. \u201cAre you ready to be the voice that gets judged by people who\u2019ve never lifted a kettle?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve always been singing into a microphone that nobody could see.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen let somebody see it,\u201d said Len. \u201cLet them see it and do not give away your bones. You keep them. You can lend your skin to the dress-up, but keep the bones.\u201d\n\nShe laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re full of metaphors for an old postman.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like a parcel,\u201d he said. \u201cI spend half my life thinking about what\u2019s inside the paper and the other half about how to make sure it gets there. This is a parcel. Nobody else gets to say what\u2019s inside. Not even that nice lady on the TV with the hair like a cat fell asleep on her head.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even know who you\u2019re talking about,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI know enough about hair,\u201d he said. He took a sip and then breathed like tea was a small holiday. He looked at her, properly looked, which was a thing he did and that was a gift and sometimes felt like the opposite. \u201cYou\u2019re shaking,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 vibrating,\u201d she said. \u201cIs that allowed? I\u2019m happy. And terrified. Because if I go and I\u2019m\u2026 and I do something and I fall over my own tongue\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we will laugh,\u201d he said. \u201cWe who know you will laugh and we will say, there she is, our girl who can balance six plates and a hat and a casual remark and also a song, and she went and fell over her own tongue. And the sea will still go in and out. And you will come here and eat toast.\u201d\n\n\u201cToast solves everything,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cEverything worth solving,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, what do you need from me?\u201d\n\n\u201cAdvice,\u201d she said. \u201cOr a paper bag to breathe into. Or\u2026 maybe just to sit here and have you look at me like I am not about to fly apart.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not about to fly apart,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are about to expand. They are different. Expansion sounds dramatic, but it just means there\u2019s more of you in the same place.\u201d\n\nShe breathed properly then. Having him in the room did something to time. It made it less spiky. It made it lie down in a sunny patch and sigh. She sat with him for an hour, talking nonsense like it was a very important subject, and the thing inside her that wanted to run along the inside of her skin calmed to a jog.\n\nLater, when the sky had lowered itself to a gentler angle and the chill had started to find her wrists, she walked home and called her mother. Her mother did not pick up, because her mother rarely picked up first try; she was a woman who let phones ring out like superstitions and then phoned back at a time when you were in the bath. Maisie left a message. \u201cHi. It\u2019s me. Just\u2026 can you call me? I\u2019ve got news. It\u2019s the kind you laugh at and then cry about and then laugh again. Nothing bad. Okay. I love you. Call back. Or don\u2019t. But do.\u201d\n\nBy the time she ate something that had previously been pasta and sauce and was now a memory of both, the email from Lorna had arrived with all the energy of a person in an office whose desk was holding up a small part of the world. It had attachments. It had instructions that were instructions but also prayers that she would obey. It had a cheerful paragraph about what to pack and what not to bring and how hair could be done in twelve minutes if you didn't mind it looking like it had been asked a difficult question. It had a line about \u201cmedia training,\u201d which made her think of a horse master teaching a radio how to jump a fence.\n\nShe lay on her bed and stared at the ceiling, which had a stain in the corner shaped like a country that didn\u2019t exist, and let the idea sit. The idea walked around her room, curious, touching things, trying on her coat, looking out her window. She told it, \u201cI\u2019m ready when you are,\u201d and the idea smiled at her like a child about to run very fast uphill.\n\nThe next day at The Driftwood she told Mrs. Pike in the gap between a latte and a layer cake. \u201cI need next week off,\u201d she said, and watched as Mrs. Pike\u2019s bun tightened another quarter of an inch.\n\n\u201cAre you going to your cousin\u2019s thing?\u201d asked Mrs. Pike. \u201cThe one with the horse and the meadow and the terrible kebab van?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to London,\u201d Maisie said. She tried to say it in the same tone she\u2019d say, \u201cI\u2019m going to Brighton,\u201d which was to say, casually, like she did it daily. It came out in italics anyway. \u201cTo sing. On that programme.\u201d She did not say the name because she was still nervous that saying it might break it.\n\n\u201cWe will have to find someone else to insult the scones,\u201d said Mrs. Pike. She put the cloth down. She looked at Maisie like she was both fifteen and thrity. \u201cAll right. Go and be famous. But don\u2019t be rude about it. And come back. Because the plates will not carry themselves and Jai will start experimenting with cr\u00eapes again if we\u2019re left alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come back,\u201d Maisie said, with a conviction that surprised her, because she didn\u2019t know yet what coming back would be like, whether it would be with cameras at her shoulder, or just with the idea that followed her like a breeze long after you\u2019ve shut all the windows.\n\nJai hugged her like he had known this was in the post and had invited everybody to the surprise party in his head. \u201cI told you,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI told you the universe wants an encore. Bring me a souvenir eyebrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom whose face,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYour choice,\u201d he said. \u201cEthically sourced.\u201d\n\nBefore her shift ended, the boy with the skateboard had returned, minus the dog, as if he had had to separate his life into parts for everyone\u2019s safety. \u201cMy gran watches that show,\u201d he told Maisie after ordering a slice of Victoria sponge large enough to be a weight training routine. He told her because she had told him what she was going to do; she had felt so full she had to tell somebody and the boy had been at the counter and she had had a cake knife in her hand and things felt simple when you had a cake knife in your hand. \u201cShe says they ruin people on there, but she watches it anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey ruin cake,\u201d said Maisie, cutting another piece with the concentration of a surgeon. \u201cBut I\u2019m good at cake. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nHe nodded solemnly like a judge. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the face for it,\u201d he said. She waited for him to define it. He didn\u2019t. He just ate his cake with the logic of a teenager: all at once, like an apology he had decided to accept.\n\nBy Saturday, the town had begun to notice something different about the way she moved. People don\u2019t always name it, that shimmer, they just ask more questions about the weather as if weather could part its skies and explain. She met Lorna\u2019s requirements like ticking boxes on a sheet \u2014 she sent a scan of her passport, she tried on outfits whose seams thought about opinions, she practised songs in her bathroom where the sound bounced back onto her skin and made her feel more material. She told Len about the fittings and he muttered something about \u201cdon\u2019t let them put you in feathers unless you intend to fly,\u201d and then \u201cand don\u2019t let them put you in anything that says \u2018confidence\u2019 on the tag.\u201d\n\nTwo days before she was due in London, she went to the open mic at The Oriole, a pub behind the station that smelt of chip fat and history. She stood in the corner with a pint of ginger beer and felt like a person carrying fireworks under a big coat. She watched the man who always sang Oasis and the woman who did country songs like she had grown up in a field with a horse called Big Trouble. She sang second to last, because that was often the place where the room is either very ready or very tired. She sang a song she had written late on a Tuesday night while her upstairs neighbour had a fight with his kettle. She saw the words float out and sit on people\u2019s shoulders like birds. She didn\u2019t tell them about the telly because it felt like telling someone at the birth of a child how cheap the nappies were at a particular shop. It wasn\u2019t the time.\n\nAfter, the man who ran the thing \u2014 with hair that had chosen a side and then thought again halfway \u2014 said, \u201cThat was beautiful,\u201d and she said, \u201cThanks,\u201d and it felt like touching hands.\n\nWhen she walked home, the air tasted of cold metal, like licking a coin. She found herself thinking more about the rehearsals, about the stage managers with headsets who made the modern world work, about the way the floor of the stage would feel under her shoes. She let herself picture it. She let herself see the camera like an eye that wasn\u2019t unfriendly. She told herself she would not turn into a person who only thought about applause. She told herself that, and the gulls cried like they knew the punchline to a joke she hadn\u2019t heard yet.\n\nOn the morning she was due to take the train, she packed a small suitcase with clothes that could be rolled to save space and dreams that couldn\u2019t. She put in the blue dress because it promised to do her shoulders a kindness, and a pair of boots that made her feel taller because sometimes shoes lied in the right way. She packed cereal bars for lines, and tea bags because not all tea is created equal, and the battered notebook with the songs that had left and the ones that hadn\u2019t yet found their door. She texted Len: Leaving soon. Promise to send a picture of my exhibit at the Museum of Overwhelm. He replied with a thumbs-up and a sentence: Do not forget your bones.\n\nHer mother called as she was locking the door. \u201cYou\u2019re going to London,\u201d she said, voice all breath like she had run up stairs. \u201cTo sing. On the telly. Just like\u2014\u201d She couldn\u2019t say who, because who was a person who had left a long time ago with a guitar and never phoned. \u201cJust like some people do.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people do,\u201d said Maisie. \u201cI am some people. Are you proud? Or do you need to see my shoes first?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud,\u201d her mother said. \u201cBut not because of the telly. I\u2019m proud because you said you would. And you kept a promise to a girl who sang to the spoon drawer.\u201d\n\nMaisie cried, a little, like a kettle does when you don\u2019t give it enough water and it makes noises anyway. She told her mother she loved her. She promised to wave at the camera in a way only she would recognise. She promised to remember to eat. She promised to take pictures of buildings because her mother loved buildings, even the ugly ones, because they told the truth.\n\nAt the station, the wind got serious and tried to make everyone reconsider their hairstyle. The train came in belching air and possibility. She climbed aboard with her case bumping the step. She sat by the window and watched Eastbourne slip past like a photograph being pulled slowly away from her eyes. She saw the pier slide sideways and the sea become the kind of blue that hides under things. She watched the backs of houses, their private gardens, their laundry in defiance, their trampoline moons. She saw country slide in, flat and green and then suddenly rising, as if taking a deep breath.\n\nIn her lap, her hands lay very still. She watched other people on the train performing versions of themselves they reserved for travel. A man angled his newspaper the way a man does when he wants to be asked about the world. A girl with headphones practised expressions in the reflection, tiny adjustments as if she were ironing her face. A woman ate an apple like it was punching back.\n\nShe tried to imagine the studio. She tried to imagine the corridor that would lead to the stage, how it would smell \u2014 of metal and hairspray and nerves arranged into flowers \u2014 and how her feet would sound on it. She tried to imagine the judge table like an altar and the audience like a weather system. She didn\u2019t let herself reach the part where names rang out and a confetti cannon dreamt of confetti. She kept herself in the corridor. She walked down it in her head, slowly. She reached for the door. She opened it. She\u2014\n\nThe train lurched. A baby cried like a trumpet being stepped on. She laughed at herself and took a photo of the sky because it was there.\n\nWhen she reached London, a woman with a clipboard and a practised grin appeared at the end of the platform like she\u2019d grown there. \u201cMaisie,\u201d she said, in a voice that saw ten moves ahead. \u201cHi. I\u2019m Saj. I\u2019m taking you to the hotel where you\u2019ll meet the other wild\u2014 the other participants. Do you have everything? Any heavy emotional baggage? I can carry it for you but only to the car.\u201d\n\n\u201cI travel light,\u201d said Maisie, and Saj smiled with one corner of her mouth as if that was a good joke she had heard before and liked more every time.\n\nThe city opened like a book she had read in school and then again as an adult and found different words. The streets smelled of coffee and secrets. The pavements had their own personality and wanted you to know it. People moved the way schools of fish move when they\u2019re pretending to be individuals. She watched everything. She watched herself watching everything. She let herself be impressed and didn\u2019t apologize for it.\n\nThe hotel lobby had carpets designed to discourage people from thinking about stains, and chairs that looked like they had been made for people who were born to sit. There were flowers arranged with such intent that you imagined the person who had arranged them had apologised to each petal. Saj gave her a packet of papers and a badge with her name on it and a schedule that made her stomach both lift and settle. \u201cYou\u2019re on at nine tomorrow for wardrobe,\u201d Saj said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do a little interview today for social, like, your \u2018I\u2019m here!\u2019 moment. Can you say \u2018I\u2019m here\u2019 in a way that doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re being hunted?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can say it like I\u2019ve just found cake,\u201d said Maisie.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d said Saj. \u201cThat\u2019s the vibe.\u201d\n\nIn the elevator, there were mirrors on all four sides, and she saw herself multiplied, and she told each version of herself to be brave. When she reached her floor, she met a girl with hair the colour of a peach and earrings that could have moonlight caught in them. \u201cYou\u2019re Maisie,\u201d the girl said, and hugged her as if they were already remembering how to miss each other. \u201cI\u2019m Nova. Are you terrified? I\u2019m terrified. I\u2019m also pretending to be a person who is used to this. Look, I have a bag. It looks like a bag a used-to-this person would carry, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does,\u201d said Maisie. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of buying a hat that says \u2018calm\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake sure it fits,\u201d Nova said. \u201cSome hats lie.\u201d\n\nThe room was a room that could have been in any city, with a bed large enough to hold a small country\u2019s problems and three pillows that behaved. She opened the blinds and let the grey of the London sky in. The buildings opposite were rectangles of promise. She tried the bed and found it did that hotel bed thing where it pretends to be your mother while also being firm. She lay back and the ceiling had a soft way of being. She breathed once and then twice and then her phone buzzed with a message from Jai: Bring me a souvenir eyebrow and a story. She wrote back: Eyebrows grow on trees here.\n\nIn the afternoon, she sat on a chair in front of a camera and said, \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d and tried to say it like cake, like sunshine on the pier, like a guitar string finding the note. She did it three times because the first time had too much laugh in it and the second had not enough. She categorised herself: Person with Enough. She made a joke and the cameraman laughed with his mouth closed, and that was a good sound, because it was honest. She was asked a question about what this meant to her, and she thought of Len and his kettle and the look on his face when he held a letter with someone\u2019s name on it a thousand times and then had to put it through the slot. She said: \u201cIt means I get to try. It means I get to be the person who tries. I have always wanted to be the person who tries.\u201d\n\nBack in her room, it was half past six and the lights of the city were beginning to argue with the sunset. She thought of eating. She thought of going out and finding a takeaway that tasted like something new. She thought of staying in and ordering a tray that would arrive under a silver dome like in a story where people have staff. She looked at her bank account and decided treat now, worry later. She ordered hotel soup and something they called \u2018heritage bread\u2019 like it had been in someone\u2019s family for generations.\n\nWhen it came, she dipped the bread in the soup and pretended she was a person who always dipped bread in soup in hotels. The sounds of the corridor \u2014 a laugh, a wheelie suitcase, a hush of voices that had decided to be conspirators \u2014 were weirdly comforting. She set her alarm for too early and put Lorna\u2019s email on the bedside table like a talisman. She texted Len: In the big smoke, not yet smoked. He replied: Good girl. Take a photo of an ugly building and tell your mother it\u2019s handsome.\n\nBefore she slept, she stood by the window and watched a fox cross a road like it owned it, tail a flag. She thought about the corridor again, about the stage door, about the camera that wasn\u2019t a camera but an eye. She told herself to bring her bones. She told herself to sing to the oat milk and the jam tarts and the gulls, because that was where the voice came from. She told herself a story about a girl from Eastbourne with plates in her hands and a song in her chest and a tide that kept coming in and going out and in again, no matter who laughed when.\n\nShe slept. She dreamed of the pier dressed in fairy lights and a sky that could be held. The next morning she woke with her mouth dry and her heart doing a small tap dance. She put her hair up and her hope on and went downstairs to let the day begin.\n\nIn the hallway outside the room where wardrobe lived, there was a dog. A big one with a fur that had decided to be complicated, sitting next to a handler who looked at his watch like it was an enemy. The dog looked at Maisie with calm eyes and yawning calm breath. She reached out, because she was the sort of person who trusted dogs, and the handler said, \u201cHe\u2019s not working, you can,\u201d and she scratched behind the dog\u2019s ear and said, \u201cHi, mate,\u201d and the dog gave her a look that could have been a blessing in a different story, in the story where dogs are oracles and the ending can be guessed early.\n\nInside, there were rails of clothes in colours that knew how to behave on camera. There were people with tape measures around their necks like medals and pins sticking out of their lips, not dangerously, just stylishly. There were jokes about sequins and vows never to wear flesh-coloured anything. Nova was trying on something that glittered like a fish. \u201cToo much?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cJust enough,\u201d said a stylist with white hair that had decided to be cloud.\n\nWhen they held the blue dress up to Maisie, the room nodded. \u201cThis one knows your shoulder,\u201d said a woman whose bracelets made a noise like a quiet tambourine. \u201cIf it argues, let it. Arguments are interesting.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Maisie said. \u201cAs long as it doesn\u2019t hold a grudge.\u201d\n\nIt was all happening at a speed that at once exhilarated and unsteadied. Photos were taken of her standing still, and then moving, and then laughing, and then being asked to laugh again but less like a tickle and more like a new idea. Someone did her hair with the confidence of a person who had tamed storms. Someone did her face like they were painting a small faithful house with good windows. Someone laced her into something. Someone told her, \u201cDon\u2019t change,\u201d and someone else said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to change everything,\u201d and she thought, is this the same sentence or two different wrongs?\n\nIn the small break between glam and PR she found her corner and her notebook. She found her pen and a place to write. She wrote: Len says keep bones. Jai says eyebrows. Mum says spoon drawer. She wrote: corridor. She wrote: I am here. She wrote: I am here in a way that only I am. And she drew a gull that looked like a child had drawn it and the child had been in a hurry.\n\nSaj found her there and sat on the floor beside her like the floor was a friend. \u201cOkay?\u201d Saj said. \u201cToo much? Tell me if it\u2019s too much. I can take you to a small room where nothing happens for ten minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d said Maisie. \u201cI\u2019m a little\u2026 hummed. Like when the fridge sings.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that hum,\u201d said Saj. \u201cIt\u2019s the pre-noise. You\u2019ll be good. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you what you mean. You get to decide that bit.\u201d\n\nWhen rehearsal came, the stage was everything she had imagined and also something else. The lights were friendly until they weren\u2019t. The floor was black and glossy, like a river that had been trained to stay. The cameras swung with the languid authority of cranes. The studio seats rose in arcs that made you feel like you were at the bottom of a very pleasant bowl. It smelt faintly of steel and makeup and a coffee that had died valiantly for a good cause.\n\nShe stood on the mark that had her name in yellow chalk like a schoolyard, and she held the microphone in the way she had practised, with an ease that was both true and invented. She closed her eyes once to see if her voice needed darkness, and then she opened them because the eyes are part of the song. She heard the opening bar in the monitor in her ear and she began. She sang a line and the room listened or didn\u2019t. She sang another. She hit the note she had practised standing on her bathtub, toes gripping porcelain, and it came out like a bird that had been waiting to be let out and knew exactly where the open window was.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good one,\u201d said a voice from the dark. It might have been a stage manager or a lighting guy, someone whose job was to make miracles happen and whose compliment was the currency of a very efficient country. She smiled at the dark. She sang again. Her hands knew not to shake. Her mouth knew which name to say. She finished and the room did a small polite clap that felt important because it had come from people who knew the work of making small revolutions happen every day.\n\nAfter, backstage, where corridors pretended to be endless, she found Nova and a boy called Albie who was nineteen and had a voice like a boat. They had the look of children who had eaten too much sugar. They spoke in a language that was mostly adjectives and hope. They made promises to each other about the future as if the future had ears.\n\nIn the tiny gap of her own company, she sat with her phone in her hand, her case open, her shoes making a decision. She thought of Eastbourne and of the Driftwood and of the pier wearing its best, and of Len and his toast, and of her mother watching a building on television. She thought of a terrier with a leader. She thought of a boy with a skateboard and his gran\u2019s complicated love for programmes that ruin people and rescue them. She laughed at nothing in particular.\n\nThis was the beginning. This was the middle of the beginning. Some of the story would happen on television and some of it would happen in rooms where nobody was watching. The sea would continue to do sea. Plates would still need carrying. Voices would still need to be whispered into the ears of bad weather. And somewhere, in the space between that humming stage and her hand on a tea mug, a girl would understand something about what it is to want, and what it is to take, and what it is to go on wanting even when the thing you have taken becomes a different animal in your hands.\n\nShe went to sleep that night in a hotel bed in a city that had more light than it needed and less kindness than it deserved, and she told herself again, quietly, so as not to wake the girls in the walls and the dreams on the furniture: I am here. I am here. I am here.Morning in the hotel was a different species of morning, as if somebody had drawn it with a ruler. The light seeped around blackout curtains like a polite burglar, the air conditioning continued its polite argument with itself, and the city outside coughed discreetly into its sleeve. Maisie woke as if surfacing from water that had remembered to be warm, her body briefly surprised to find itself in a square of expensive quiet. For a few seconds she lay still and listened to the sort of silence you could only buy by the night, a silence made of elevators that hushed themselves and carpets that forgave shoes. She checked her phone with one eye and found three messages from Jai timestamped too late and too early: a photo of the Driftwood\u2019s new chalkboard special (\u201cSuspicious Quiche \u2014 Market Price\u201d), a close-up of a customer\u2019s hat that could have sheltered rabbits, and a voice note that was mostly steam hiss and then, \u201cBreak a leg but in the metaphor way, and if they try to make you sing in a cloud of dry ice, tell them you\u2019ve got damp lungs.\u201d\n\nHer reply was a heart and a promise she could not word that early. She sat up and found that her throat had done the hotel thing where it felt as if she\u2019d been speaking in her sleep to a roomful of dignitaries. She drank water straight from the glass bottle because it felt like the kind of day where you could pretend you were in a film about competence. She did the ridiculous vocal warm-ups in the shower, the ones that turned her vowels into bubbles and made her laugh at herself, and the laugh worked better than the scales. When she wrapped herself in the robe, it embraced her like a hug from an aunt who liked a bargain and always knew when your nails needed cutting.\n\nThe breakfast room was an international peace treaty of bacon and fruit. People in good trousers made decisions about pastry as if choosing cabinets. A small child negotiated toast with cunning usually reserved for lawyers. Maisie and Nova found a table by a window that framed a slice of building without context and compared plates as though they were comparing courage. Nova had the kind of appetite that went with fear and youth, both generous, and she speared a sausage with relief. \u201cI dreamed I was on stage and my mouth made a noise like a bicycle pump,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I woke up and it turned out to be the air con.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter than dreaming you\u2019re in bed and waking up on stage,\u201d Maisie said, buttering toast carefully, because buttering toast carefully made other things feel possible. \u201cIf my mouth makes a bicycle pump noise, I\u2019ll do it in key.\u201d\n\nNova lowered her voice and leaned in as if the yogurt might overhear. \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll make me tell the \u2018my dad left\u2019 story again? They keep asking where the music came from like it arrived on a lorry with a missing taillight.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey asked me yesterday if I\u2019d \u2018overcome adversity\u2019,\u201d Maisie said. She had rolled the phrase around her mouth afterwards and it had lost consonants until it became a pudding. \u201cI said yes. Once a man ordered a flat white and when I brought it he said he\u2019d meant a cappuccino but with less personality.\u201d\n\nNova snorted into her tea and then coughed like she had stolen laughter from the wrong pocket. \u201cSaj told me to make a list of what I won\u2019t say. I put \u2018my eyebrows are not the story\u2019 and \u2018my ex-boyfriend is not a suitable antagonist\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Maisie. \u201cAdd \u2018Eastbourne is not a sleepy town; it naps with intention\u2019.\u201d\n\nThey ate and pretended to read the schedule for the day without flinching. Nine, wardrobe adjustments. Ten, a thing called \u201cdigital pick-ups\u201d that sounded like a dating app for cameras. Eleven-thirty, vocal with the coach whose picture on the wall showed teeth that belonged to someone who flossed in public. Lunch slotted in like an apology. Two, a block of time called \u201cmedia\u201d that sat on the page like a black shoe. Four, dress rehearsal. Six, a pause before everything. The day had a shape that accepted you and then pressed you into its corners.\n\nLorna found them in the lobby wearing a lanyard and an air of being equal to it all. She looked like she had been poured into her morning with neatness. \u201cThey\u2019re cutting the backstory VT to two minutes,\u201d she said, as if discussing travel shampoo. \u201cThey want to do a line about the caf\u00e9 and the sea and how you sing between steam and jam. But we need a phrase from you, something that\u2019s\u2026 you know\u2026 na\u00efvely poetic but also true.\u201d\n\n\u201cNa\u00efvely poetic,\u201d Nova repeated, rolling the words around like mints. \u201cI can do knowingly mundane.\u201d\n\n\u201cI made friends with oat milk,\u201d Maisie said, because the phrase rose easily to the surface. \u201cIt listens.\u201d\n\nLorna blinked and then smiled, the face of a woman who would write down anything that glinted and take it to the editor like treasure. \u201cWe\u2019ll use something like that,\u201d she said. \u201cNot exactly that, because we have a thing with brands and sentient beverages.\u201d\n\nThey were whisked along corridors that had learned how to keep secrets by design. The wardrobe room looked different in daylight, less like a dream and more like a busy market where the currency was buckle and seam. The blue dress was there like a promise kept. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a tiny tweak,\u201d said the woman with tambourine bracelets, her fingers already coaxing a line of fabric. \u201cThe camera liked you but wanted more you at the shoulder. The trick is always you but more.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be more forehead,\u201d Maisie said, but she had learned to choose her battles, and shoulders were not the hill on which she would die. As the pins kissed and retreated, she watched herself in a mirror that softened everything like a grandmother. She had never seen herself look this much like a person somebody else might mistake for someone important. It was both thrilling and fraudulent, a twin emotion that set up camp under her sternum and erected a nice little flag.\n\nThe vocal room smelled like lemon and ambition. The coach introduced himself as Dan, shook hands with a sincerity that was almost American, and looked at her throat the way a mechanic looks at a carburettor. \u201cYou\u2019re holding a bit high in the chest,\u201d he said, tapping a sound out of her with a piano that had national service. \u201cLet the breath drop. Let yourself be heavier in the floor. Sing through your teeth like you mean it but you\u2019re not telling anyone you mean it.\u201d\n\nShe did what he said and her voice changed shape under her own ribs, surprising itself. It grew up slightly in front of her, like a child showing you it had learned to tie a knot. Dan nodded once and then again, more slowly. \u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t apologise with your vibrato. It\u2019s very British to apologise with your vibrato. London will forgive you. America will not. You\u2019re not in America.\u201d\n\nShe laughed and he smiled in that careful way coaches do when they sprinkle humour between metronomes. Nova went next and built a note so clean it might have been a decision. They clapped each other because that\u2019s what you do when you\u2019ve been given the same mountain and different shoes.\n\nBy late morning she had answered the same question about her \u201cjourney\u201d four times with four different verbs. She had learned which doors led to rooms that had coffee and which led to rooms that had important people saying the word \u201cbrand\u201d like it was an endangered bird. She had nodded carefully at a producer who said, \u201cCan we avoid mentioning your father unless we absolutely need to,\u201d and she had replied, \u201cWe absolutely do not need to.\u201d The producer had glanced at her with relief and then tapped a note into a phone as if saving a life.\n\nBack in the hotel corridor, her mother called at last, the call bouncing off the international carpet pattern like a pebble across a pond. \u201cI\u2019ve made sandwiches,\u201d her mother said, triumphant, as though announcing a medical breakthrough. \u201cFor the train. Ham and something that looks like cheese but isn\u2019t. I\u2019m on the twelve-oh-six with Maureen because she says she will not watch you alone in the house in case she goes blind with nerves.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were coming,\u201d Maisie said, feeling the floor shift in a lovely way that made you adjust your weight for joy. \u201cI can get you tickets, I think. Saj can do\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need tickets,\u201d her mother said, already three moves ahead on a board Maisie didn\u2019t see. \u201cWe\u2019re going to watch at Maureen\u2019s sister\u2019s because she has the big telly and the kind of wine that makes you honest. We tried to get audience places but they said something about lotteries and liability. We\u2019ll shout at the right times. We\u2019ve practised. Also, I found your old recorder in the drawer with the birthday candles. It still has a tune in it. This means something.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means nothing,\u201d Maisie said, delighted. \u201cIt means the drawer is haunted. I\u2019ll send you a picture when I\u2019m in the thing. Don\u2019t wear the jumper that is allergic to cameras.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has opinions,\u201d her mother said. \u201cI will silence it with a necklace. I love you. Don\u2019t let them do your hair like that woman on the breakfast show who looks as if she\u2019s been plugged in.\u201d\n\nAfter lunch (soup that tried to be both comforting and chic and achieved one of those), Saj found her leaning against a wall that probably had a stronger agent than she did. \u201cTwo small items,\u201d Saj said, in the calm tone of a person who holds back weather for a living. \u201cOne: the head of hair has asked if we can add a hairpiece for the second verse because the lights love movement. Two: social is posting your teaser at three, and there will be comments. Do you want them on your phone or do you want me to take the bullet and send you only the kind ones and the funny ones about shoes?\u201d\n\n\u201cSend me the ones about shoes,\u201d said Maisie. \u201cAnd one cruel one so I know the world hasn\u2019t ended.\u201d\n\nSaj nodded gravely, as though crudity could be apportioned like salt. \u201cAlso,\u201d she added, in a quieter voice that was almost a gift, \u201cif anyone uses the phrase \u2018girl-next-door\u2019 in a way that makes your teeth itch, you can send them to me and I will talk to them about doors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Maisie said. \u201cAnd no hairpiece that moves like animal. If it rustles, it\u2019s out.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d Saj said, with a little salute that could have been irony or genuine affection. \u201cAnd Sidenote Len called the office and left a message. He said, \u2018Tell the girl that the post is still delivered in the rain.\u2019 I don\u2019t know what it means, but he sounded like a person who meant it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means I can\u2019t cancel the day just because my socks get wet,\u201d Maisie said, feeling the words settle into place like weights that made her steadier. \u201cAnd it means he likes to be mysterious on purpose.\u201d\n\nThe digital pick-up involved a white wall, a swingy light, and a camera that leaned in like a friend who wants to hear who you\u2019re talking about. \u201cSay your name and where you\u2019re from,\u201d the director said, friendly, patient, a man who had taught many people to walk through a sentence. \u201cThen give us three words that describe you. Try not to say \u2018fun\u2019, because fun people never say fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Maisie Linton,\u201d she said, hearing her own voice and greeting it as if it were a relative who had aged well. \u201cFrom Eastbourne, which is not a seaside clich\u00e9 although it does have better clich\u00e9s than anywhere else. Three words. I am\u2026 curious. I am\u2026 late sometimes. I am\u2026 here.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d the director said, the way you say good to a plant that has just surprised you. \u201cNow say something you\u2019d say to your younger self. Not the one from this morning. The one with the recorder in the drawer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say drink water and keep the songs even when they look badly dressed,\u201d she said, and then felt unaccountably like crying, which was unhelpful, so she smiled instead and asked if that had been usable. The cameraman made the mouth laugh again, and that was enough to hold her together.\n\nDress rehearsal had the texture of reality with all the edges taped. They put her in the dress and the shoes and the little invisibility devices that made the sound disappear into her head and come back like a perfect circle. They gave her a mark on the floor and a cue she could feel in her belly. They asked her to walk as if she had been born on a mark. The lights warmed up like engines. The audience seats were dappled with production assistants, bored and brilliant, clapping in the right places because they had read the map. She ran the song once fully and then again half-hearted because the third time is for people who can afford to get tired early.\n\nOn the second run, her in-ear monitor did the thing the universe sometimes does where it whispers, Something will go wrong and that something will be you. The sound cut and she found herself hearing the room instead of herself, a slapback of reality. She stopped where she would rather not stop and lifted her hand slightly in the international sign for, \u201cI am not being a diva but please help me or I will cry.\u201d A figure emerged from the wings with a coil of cable and a headtorch and the ease of a god of small rescues. He adjusted something in a way that had been invented for this precise crisis, and he gave her a nod as if to say, There, the world again. She sang the bar she had missed, and the note curled out obedient and true. Somewhere in the darkness, someone clapped once because they understood the relief contained in a correct return.\n\nBy late afternoon the building had clicked into live-show mode. Tempers in far corners rose and fell like souffl\u00e9s. Trolleys rolled laden with impossible flowers. A coffee went cold upright on a sheet of call times as if it had been mid-sentence. She felt a slow, steady mechanism crank within herself, a sense of gears aligning with the coming hour. She found the little quiet room Saj had promised and sat there, the silence a warm coat. On the wall was a poster from an old series, a girl with perfect hair and teeth arranged like white weather. Someone had scrawled across it, in a hand that was both defiant and grieving: She cried and then she sang better. Maisie looked at it and had a feeling that was not envy and not warning, just a flicker of recognition that people are always two things at once.\n\nHer phone buzzed. It was Len, of course, having remembered the twenty-first-century version of shouting across a road. He sent a photograph of toast. He had arranged it on a plate with the seriousness of a saint. Under it he wrote: Above acceptable standard. You?\n\nShe took a picture of her shoes obediently aligned beneath the chair and wrote: Believing my own ankles. He replied: Good ankles run in the family. Also, if a camera tries to steal your soul, keep a copy.\n\nAt six, the host breezed into the corridor with the kind of presence that made corridors remember why they exist. He said things to people as if he had invented cheer and was now licensing it. He said to her, \u201cYou\u2019re our little caf\u00e9 singer, aren\u2019t you,\u201d and she resisted the urge to correct the possessive and simply smiled and said, \u201cI am someone\u2019s little caf\u00e9 singer,\u201d because that was true and left him nowhere to stand but where he already was. He waggled his eyebrows at her in a way that suggested they were self-employed and then moved on, trailed by a woman carrying cards and a man wearing the expression of a person who had once been surprised and swore never again.\n\nSaj appeared with a garment bag and a gaze that could focus satellites. \u201cTwo minutes for a breath,\u201d she said. \u201cThen we place you. Your song is third. They changed the running order because the second act\u2019s backdrop is allergic to light cues, which is not a thing I knew backdrops could be. If you need to pee, do it now. If you need to cry, do it now. If you need to write a will, it can wait.\u201d\n\nMaisie checked her face in a compact handed to her by a woman who could have sculpted a better face out of meringue and air. She smoothed a thing that didn\u2019t need smoothing. She put her hand to her chest and felt the small metronome of her heart, faithful and unruly. \u201cI am going to sing to the jam tarts,\u201d she told Saj, half under her breath. \u201cEven if the jam tarts are in other houses.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Saj said. \u201cBetter ratings.\u201d\n\nThey moved as a group, like a dance where the steps were equipment and the music was warnings. She stood in the wings and felt the heat of the place, simultaneous and particular, the way a kitchen has heat you can only describe by being in it. The first act sang and a wall of sound rose and fell, and she allowed herself one peek at the audience without seeing them. The second act stood behind the flat with a look that said, If I run now, I can catch a bus out of town, and then didn\u2019t run, because solidarity is contagious.\n\nHer turn came with the inevitability of a train arriving exactly when it says it will. A floor manager with kind eyes and a count-in finger pointed at her. \u201cThirty seconds,\u201d he said, the number clean on his hand. \u201cBreathe. Two deep. Remember your first line. Then forget it and mean it.\u201d His headset crackled in a language that only headsets speak, and he listened to the invisible world and nodded as if it had promised to be good. \u201cTen,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got this, love.\u201d\n\nMaisie stepped onto the mark. The lights cooled and then warmed. The set shifted its weight and settled. The mic was a small planet in her hand. Somewhere far away and very close, a camera blinked. She thought of the Driftwood and the lemon paint peeling in long careful strips. She thought of Mrs. Pike and her institutional bun. She thought of Jai and his eyebrows as a souvenir. She thought of Len\u2019s toast and her mother\u2019s sandwich cut diagonally because that did something to fate. She thought of the dog in the hallway and of a boy with a skateboard. She thought of the corridor in her mind that she had walked down a thousand times without seeing the door open.\n\nThe music found her in the ear and the floor found her feet and the breath settled the way a bird settles on a wire and trusts the wind. She opened her mouth and let the note out, not like a plea, not like a trick, but like a statement that had been waiting politely to speak. The room shifted slightly towards her. The camera came closer or she went to meet it; in that moment it was impossible to say. She sang the second line and brought her shoulders into it without apology. She remembered, mid-phrase, to open the vowels like windows, the way Dan had shown her, and the sound stepped out onto a balcony and waved.\n\nHalfway through, when the lyric asked her to confess to something she did not owe anyone, she chose instead to tell a simpler truth. It sat inside the line and made it feel different, less like a borrowed dress and more like a jacket she had owned for years. The bridge came and she walked across it without looking down. At the top note, the one she had prised open in her bathroom with steam and stubbornness, the place where women have dropped or soared in front of millions, she did not think of millions. She thought of a little girl singing to a spoon drawer. She thought of oat milk and gulls. The note rose and it did not wobble and it did not apologise. It rang, clean and blue, like a bit of the sea you can hold.\n\nWhen it was done, there was the sound that is noise and also information. Hands and breath and the small thunder of feet finding a floor they liked. She did not let herself look at the judges because she did not owe her face to their faces. Instead she let her eyes find a place at the back of the room where perhaps there was a person who had chosen to come alone and would be glad of being addressed without being named. She smiled, not because someone would freeze it on a feed and measure it, but because it was a reflex like the tide. She managed not to cry until she was three steps off the mark and safely in a pocket of unlit air that smelt faintly of spray and hairspray and relief.\n\nBackstage hugged her in a way she could use. Nova grabbed her and said things with her whole mouth that did not land as language and did not need to. Albie thumped her back like a brother on a pier avoiding feeling too much. Dan the vocal coach passed and made a small circle with thumb and forefinger, a sign language of competence. Lorna breathed out like a person whose plates had all spun and not fallen. Saj pressed a bottle of water into her hand the way you hand someone a verdict, and the water understood.\n\nThe judges spoke in the room out there, the room with the expensive noises. Someone said a word that had too much sugar around it. Someone else said a sentence that took away with one hand and returned it with the other, like a pickpocket doing magic. It would be clipped later and placed on the internet and captioned in fonts she could not control. She listened for a second and then stopped, not ungrateful, just self-preserving. She heard her name pronounced correctly and decided that was a good omen.\n\nAlone for a sliver of time you could slip a coin through, she went to the quiet room and sat on the chair as if sitting were something you could fail. Her phone was a small, lit planet on the table. There were messages from numbers that had fathers attached and from unknowns with hearts in their names. There was a message from her mother that read simply: I see you. There was one from Len with no text, just a video of the sea hitting the Eastbourne beach with its reliable enthusiasm. There was one from Jai: The dog approves. He had attached a photo of a terrier watching a television with an intent so serious it was comic. She laughed properly then, dipped her head and laughed, and let the laugh be the thing that unlocked the rest.\n\nThe night reassembled itself around her like furniture after guests. There were more acts and more lights and a segment in which a former champion came back to sing about the high cost of triumph and dental. There were results that trailed their suspense like wedding trains. There was a moment on the stage with a cluster of other people where the host called her name and a camera found her again, and she thought, of course you did, and she stood in the shower of a sound she did not own and nodded and remembered to reassure the people at home that she was indeed still grateful. There was a hand squeeze from Nova that said, We will get through or we will go for chips. There was the strange etiquette around not looking too victorious next to someone who needed a chair.\n\nLater, in the post-something room where questions were asked to fill content like pastry shells, a young man with a microphone that had a foam windscreen the colour of a cartoon asked her, bright as a whistle, \u201cSo, what does this mean for the caf\u00e9? Are you moving on?\u201d and she said, without being noble and without being foolish, \u201cIt means the caf\u00e9 gets more stories to put between the teapots. It means I can carry plates and a song at the same time for as long as that makes sense,\u201d and he blinked and nodded and said, \u201cLove that,\u201d as if he had invented nuance.\n\nBack in her room, alone at last with her face and her feet and her hands that smelt vaguely of roses and microphones, she stood in the window and watched the city keeping its late promises. She took the pins out of her hair one by one, feeling each tiny release as if she were returning parts of herself to herself. She washed the paint from her skin and saw her own colour come back like tide turning on a familiar beach. In the mirror, unvarnished and unscripted, she was a person who had done a thing and would do another, not a legend, not a cautionary tale, and not yet a footnote.\n\nBefore bed she wrote a few lines in her book. She wrote: I let the note out and it did not bite me. She wrote: Saj says doors are not people. She wrote: The dog approved. She drew a toast and under it a gull and under that a small rectangle that could be a stage or a table. She closed the book and it clicked shut like a good thought. She crawled under the hotel duvet which had the exact weight of reassurance and she let sleep come, not because she was done, but because morning would be a mouth and she would need to fill it.\n\nWhen she woke at three, as people do when their bodies have stored messengers, she felt the quiet hum of the building like a ship in friendly weather. She looked at the ceiling and thought of the stain in her flat shaped like a country that didn\u2019t exist. She thought of the pier in fairy lights that had visited her in a past dream. She let herself imagine the next song, the one she hadn\u2019t dared offer, the one that lived in two keys like a house with two front doors. She heard in her head the way the band would find it, the way the cameras would learn to nod. She let the thought be large enough to scare her. Then she rolled over and trusted the dark.\n\nIn the morning, she would wake and the city would draw its lines and write her in again where needed. She would answer questions and ignore others. She would drink tea that tried very hard and might succeed. She would text pictures of ugly buildings to her mother and call them handsome. She would look after her bones and let the dresses borrow her, and she would sing to anyone who had once been a spoon drawer. The programme would go on wanting. The sea would go on doing. She would go on being a person who tried. And somewhere, in the Driftwood, a terrier would scratch at the door as if demanding a fork.Morning decided to be obvious about itself. It ironed the clouds flat and sent a band of pale yellow across the buildings with all the ceremony of a first cup of tea. The city coughed properly this time, none of last night\u2019s discreet hand-over-mouth, and somewhere a van reversed with the persistence of a metronome. Maisie woke with her tongue feeling as if it had been speaking foreign the whole night and her shoulders aware of having been loaned to a dress. For a moment she didn\u2019t know which ceiling belonged to her, and then the air-conditioning made its civilised wheeze and the carpet under her bare foot told her she was still inside a place that believed in breakfast buffets and emergency sewing kits in tiny boxes.\n\nHer phone did the thing of being both a door and a crowd. The red dots had multiplied as if they had been breeding when she slept. Saj had sent a packet of links with the label: shoes, only. There were indeed shoes\u2014her shoes, or at least shoes that had been attached to her for the evening\u2014assessed by strangers who spoke in hyperbole and suede. There was a clip of the high note annotated with a hundred musical emojis and three people in Texas arguing about vowel placement. There was a photo of her halfway through a laugh, hair compromising with light, captioned by the show as \u201cOur caf\u00e9 songbird,\u201d and she felt the possessive again and let it pass through her like weather. The cruel one Saj had promised was not so cruel as it had intended to be; it said something about \u201cplain,\u201d which made her laugh out loud in the hotel room because if last night had been plain then the world\u2019s adjectives needed retraining.\n\nThere were private messages that opened like parcels in a corridor you didn\u2019t know you were walking down. Some were from girls in towns with seafronts and none, with photos of mugs and windows, saying, \u201cI sing to the kettle too,\u201d and \u201cMy Nan says you remind her of someone who wasn\u2019t afraid of church.\u201d One was from the boy with the skateboard: Gran cried at the good bit and then pretended she was allergic to light. He had attached a blurry photograph of the terrier with its head tilted, as if listening critically. There was a message from Albie consisting only of a boat emoji and three exclamation marks. There were two from unknown numbers that had managed to fetch themselves into her inbox with the authority of bills; one was a production schedule, the other a request for a photograph of her as a child \u201cwith an instrument or a significant prop, perhaps a whisk,\u201d which made her sit on the edge of the bed and hold her ribs and laugh until it became a cough.\n\nBy ten she had been shepherded across two floors, into a room that smelt of hair and decisions, and into a chair with a back like a hug. The woman with the tambourine bracelets fluffed and pinned and spoke to her in a language made of compliments that were also instructions. \u201cWe\u2019re going to let you be you,\u201d she said, while pressing a hot instrument against Maisie\u2019s head. \u201cBut a little more you, for the television. The camera loves a curve and hates a shadow that looks like regret.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe camera and I will sign a truce,\u201d Maisie said, and caught her own eyes in the mirror and saw that they had not slept as much as they thought. She put her palm to the glass as if greeting a fish in a tank. The fish smiled back, which was her, which was ridiculous.\n\nDan the vocal coach appeared like a man who had just tuned a piano with his mind. He made her yawn in specific, useful ways and hum at the walls. \u201cDon\u2019t gargle coffee,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lie. Gargle water and swallow courage. Also, breathe into your kidneys.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll send them a card,\u201d she said, and he shook his head and smiled and went away to tell someone else not to apologise in their soft palate.\n\nMidway through a bite of toast stolen from a tray going somewhere more important, Saj slid into the spare chair with the authority of a person who could sit in motion. \u201cWe\u2019ve had an idea,\u201d she said mildly, the way people say \u201cwe\u2019ve had a power cut\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019re having a baby,\u201d as if both were inevitable and had asked nicely. \u201cExecutive would like to do a return-to-roots package if you progress. Film at the caf\u00e9, a walk on the pier, maybe the chalk cliffs if we can convince Health and Safety that you won\u2019t fling yourself at existence. Mrs. Pike on camera would break the internet in half. We\u2019ll ask consent like decent people. You could be home the day after tomorrow for twenty-four hours. Are you breathing? I need you to breathe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d said Maisie, who had held her breath in the middle of Saj\u2019s sentence as if underwater. \u201cMrs. Pike will say \u2018programmes\u2019 like it\u2019s a diagnosis and threaten the hair and do it anyway. Jai will wallpaper the door with puns. Len will pretend to hide. My mother will insist the house is too small to be filmed and then redecorate by moving a cushion. Yes. Yes, I\u2019ll do it. On two conditions.\u201d\n\nSaj\u2019s eyebrow went up, professional curiosity with good posture. \u201cName them,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make Eastbourne look like it\u2019s been asleep since 1983,\u201d said Maisie. \u201cAnd don\u2019t ask me to cry on the pier because the tide has opinions.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeal,\u201d Saj said immediately. \u201cWe can\u2019t control the editor\u2019s love of slow-motion gulls, but we can threaten them with a cactus. I\u2019ll call Mrs. Pike and use my best voice.\u201d\n\nThey put a hold on a train while the day unfolded like a map. There was a radio interview in a room that smelt of old laughter and sweets, where a man with a beard asked her about \u201cthe caf\u00e9 life\u201d and whether a cappuccino ever becomes a cappuccino, and she answered with grace and a joke about foam that got her invited back if she had time and liked chairs. There was a photoshoot in front of a backdrop that changed colours like a mood ring where the photographer said, \u201cGive me the woman who has just remembered a better word,\u201d and she found that woman in her jaw. There was a meeting with a producer whose wedding ring and smile both looked expensive, who took deep, meaningful sips of water and wanted to know if she would be comfortable talking about \u201cthe paternal absence that shaped your resilience,\u201d and Maisie said, evenly, with the exact amount of you\u2019re-not-fooling-me in her mouth, \u201cNo. I am comfortable talking about jam tarts and unpaid electric bills and a man on the promenade who uses his dog for moral support. The rest is bones and I am keeping them.\u201d\n\nThe producer paused, recalibrated mid-sip, and smiled as if he had always intended to be decent. \u201cFair enough,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s talk jam tarts.\u201d Later, in a lift, Saj patted her arm once, a punctuation mark. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cNot everyone knows the names of their lines. You do. That helps.\u201d\n\nNova and Albie found her at a table with a salad that looked like it had auditioned for a role in a better salad. Nova had the wide-eyed look of a person who had been crying in a bathroom not because anything had happened but because all of it had. \u201cThey asked me if I could sing the one about forgiveness,\u201d she said, stabbing a slice of cucumber as if it had done infrastructure damage. \u201cI said yes and then they said, \u2018But can you sing it about forgiveness.\u2019 I don\u2019t know what that means. My mouth is a mouth, not a moral.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means they want you to be a lighthouse and a revenue stream,\u201d Albie said, who had the soft accent of boats and had been raised by older women to carry heavy things without complaint. \u201cSing your song. They\u2019ll call it forgiveness if it trends.\u201d\n\nMaisie watched Nova\u2019s face make and unmake shapes. She reached across the table and put her hand on hers, a very small bridge. \u201cWe can go and buy chips after rehearsal,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a place the runners whisper about that salts like a religion. We will eat too much of a thing that\u2019s bad for us and talk about nothing in particular as if it\u2019s an art. You can tell me everything you won\u2019t tell that camera with the eyes. Deal?\u201d\n\nNova nodded, a swallow as decisive as a promise. \u201cDeal,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, your shoes have become content. You\u2019re viral from the ankle down.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy ankles have always wanted a social life,\u201d Maisie said, and that got them a laugh each, which was enough to move them all into the next hour.\n\nThe train the following day was at an hour that barely qualified as morning unless you were a postman or very committed to bread. Saj had arranged everything with a swish and a spreadsheet. Mrs. Pike had consented in the tone of a monarch allowing a circus into the park, and Jai had replied to a polite email from a junior researcher with, \u201cWe keep our jam tarts in their natural environment and may not be able to guarantee their performance; bring treats.\u201d Len had left a message on Maisie\u2019s phone at midnight that just said, \u201cI will be on the path between the brambles and the decision. Don\u2019t be late,\u201d which she took to mean, I will put the kettle on and I expect to be hugged.\n\nThe sky over Sussex that morning had committed to pale, the kind that makes birds visible long after they think they\u2019re private. Maisie watched the fields turn into houses and the houses into fields the way people turn into people who have to be somewhere. When she got off at Eastbourne, the platform smelled like its old self: salt and newspaper and the after-breath of coffee. A small camera crew formed a loose constellation around her, careful to make her look like a person walking instead of a person filmed walking. Saj wore a high-visibility jacket that insisted she was a human being with a plan, and a man with a boom pole held his windscreen like a friendly hedgehog. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep it small,\u201d Saj murmured. \u201cWe are wallpaper. If the wallpaper speaks, it will apologise.\u201d\n\nThe Driftwood had made an effort by pretending it had made no effort at all. The lemon paint still peeled in satisfying narratives. The bell still announced arrivals with the humility of an instrument somebody\u2019s uncle had repaired. Mrs. Pike had put on a cardigan with buttons like warnings, and her bun had achieved a height previously reserved for religious buildings. Jai had laid out the cakes in an arrangement that would have pleased an architect, and there was a handwritten sign on the counter that read: We are temporarily famous. Tips help with that.\n\nThe first customer on camera was the lady with the terrible hat, which had become more terrible as if it had been breeding with itself. She tapped a teaspoon against a saucer with intent to produce a specific note and said to Maisie in front of the lens, \u201cIf you become unbearable, I will still need jam,\u201d which was both threat and benediction. The boy with the skateboard arrived exactly when the assistant director wanted \u201ca bit of normal,\u201d his hair a decision he had made in the dark. He had left the terrier at home, he said, because he didn\u2019t want it \u201cto do a poo on telly,\u201d and then whispered that Gran had made a banner out of a pillowcase that said \u201cOur Girl,\u201d which she would display only when no one was there.\n\nMrs. Pike refused to say the word \u201cprogramme.\u201d She said, \u201ctelevision nonsense\u201d and \u201cthat business with the lights,\u201d and then finally, after a generous piece to camera about the virtue of a scone left alone to be itself, she said, \u201cour Maisie has a mouth that does good work,\u201d and took off her glasses and polished them in a way that silenced three strong men. Jai did a piece to camera in which he used the word \u201cumami\u201d incorrectly but with such glee that nobody cared. The crew filmed Maisie rinsing cups and singing under her breath, which she swore she didn\u2019t pose for and which she absolutely did. They filmed the pier from three angles and made the gulls look complicit. One gull landed on the railing behind her and performed head movements that were pure critique; the camera loved it. The assistant director whispered, \u201cCan we get the gull\u2019s agent,\u201d and Saj wrote something on her clipboard that probably said no birds in union.\n\nThey asked for a walk on the promenade \u201cjust towards the horizon and back,\u201d which was the kind of instruction people who do not live by water give. Halfway along, a man who had known Maisie vaguely since she was ten stopped them with the confidence of people who have paid rates in the town all their lives. \u201cSaw you on the telly,\u201d he said, marshalling his eyebrows into formation. \u201cVery good. Your old man will be proud if he\u2019s watching, wherever he is.\u201d\n\nThe sentence slid in under her coat and sat there with cold hands. She smiled, automatically, the way she smiled when a customer at the Driftwood asked for something the kitchen didn\u2019t make and used the words \u201cas a favour.\u201d She said, \u201cThank you,\u201d and meant the kindness and not the hook in it, and walked on with the camera faithfully walking on behind. Past the arcades, past the couple arguing about whether a donut was an experience. Saj drifted back to her like a tide being careful. \u201cYou all right,\u201d she said, not a question, which was a gift.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Maisie said, because there were people with batteries attached to them and a schedule and the town had put on its best brave face. \u201cIt\u2019s a sentence that will arrive a lot, I think. I may need to learn to nod without bruising.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will hire you a nod,\u201d Saj said, and Maisie laughed, quietly, and let the laugh make a crack where the cold could leave.\n\nThey went to see Len because no home story is complete without a man who can boil water into wisdom. He opened his back door the way a magician produces a rabbit, entirely unsurprised, and pulled Maisie into a hug which had spines under its softness. He addressed the camera politely as if it were a council officer and then ignored it completely. \u201cSit,\u201d he said to Maisie. \u201cEat this biscuit; it is older than respectable but it will hold together under pressure.\u201d He made tea, and the kettle sang to fill the spaces where none of them wanted to talk. The producer asked him if he was proud and he said, \u201cYes,\u201d as if the word had been waiting in his mouth, and then, \u201cBut I was proud when she learned to cross roads properly and when she put her name on her lunch at school as if it were a declaration. Television is a different kind of proud. It comes in a box.\u201d\n\nThe terrier appeared after all, in the third hour, in the arms of the skateboard boy who had been sent home by his gran with orders to stop hovering. It wriggled free like a thought and trotted straight into the caf\u00e9 as if on a mission from itself. A jam tart had escaped to the very edge of a plate; it was a tart that had never learned prudence. The dog placed both front paws on the counter with the authority of a small officer and took the tart delicately in its teeth like evidence. The room inhaled as one organism. The camera, being a predator by training, swung and caught the theft in a shot that would later be slowed down and set to a tiny string section. Mrs. Pike said, \u201cOh, for the love of\u2014\u201d not finishing with a word that would have needed bleeping, and Maisie, out of instinct and kindness, went around the counter to kneel, by which time the terrier had eaten the jam and offered her the even more delicate crust, as though sharing. She took the crust and the room exhaled. The assistant director murmured, \u201cWe have our ending,\u201d and even Saj allowed herself a grin that showed a tooth.\n\nBy late afternoon they had their pier walk, their caf\u00e9 hum, their Linton family offshoot being Linton in a kitchen, their gull, their dog, their hat. They had enough ordinary to make extraordinary look honest. Saj did the thank-yous like a professional bouquet. The crew folded themselves away and promised not to tidy Eastbourne up in the edit, which was the best they could give. Jai pinned a five-pound note to a corkboard and wrote Dog Tax in tidy capital letters. Mrs. Pike declared that she would never again consent to being filmed by people who did not understand the intimate relationship between sponge and custard. Len walked Maisie to the gate and held her for a moment longer than time. \u201cDid the sentence hurt,\u201d he said, in the voice he used for things you might not have words for yet.\n\n\u201cA little,\u201d she said. \u201cNot as much as it will if I keep standing still. And I stood still, Uncle. But it\u2019s\u2014I don\u2019t want to be made out of a hole. I prefer cake.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not a hole,\u201d he said, with the absolution of the elderly. \u201cYou are a road with scenic views and occasional roadworks. The hole is other people\u2019s problem. Also, that dog will be famous by teatime. Beware being upstaged by mammals.\u201d\n\nShe laughed and kissed his head and told him she would return him to the television in a fortnight, weather and scheduling permitting. Her mother had elected not to be filmed on account of having a relationship with cameras that could be described as suspicious, but she had sent Maisie off with a Tupperware of sausage rolls and a lecture about sleep that echoed in her bones. On the platform, as the train rolled in and Eastbourne arranged itself back into the shape of her childhood view, she saw the boy with the skateboard and the terrier on the far side, both of them looking as if they had done something significant by accident. She waved, and the boy nodded in that solemn way he had adopted for occasions, and the dog blinked and, without breaking eye contact, licked its nose, which felt like the highest form of acknowledgement.\n\nOn the ride back, the countryside performed its smooth vanishing act and the train exhaled at every small station like an old animal. Maisie ate a sausage roll with reverence and read the messages accumulating in clusters. The show account had posted the caf\u00e9 clip with the dog and a caption that did not entirely embarrass her. People had found it with the enthusiasm of creatures who know how to find soft things and hold them up to the light. \u201cIf she sings like she looks at that dog,\u201d wrote one, which made her grin at the window. There was also a message from a name that looked like it had taken a long time to write. It contained five words: I heard you. Proud anyway. She stared at it until the words went blurry with the reflection of the sky, and then she took a photo of a field because there was nothing else sensible to do. She did not reply. She put the phone face-down like you do with a fork when you\u2019re finished being polite.\n\nBack in the hotel the floors were in a different mood. You learn the personality of a building by how it greets you at different times of day. Tonight it was quietly thrilled, as if it had secrets in the wardrobes. In the corridor Nova was sitting cross-legged outside her room with her back against the door, hair in a knot that looked like it had decided to be contrary. She patted the carpet beside her and Maisie sat, because floors are still floors even when they are expensive. They swapped stories of the day in the way women do when the rest of the world has been speaking in content. Maisie told her about the sentence on the promenade and Nova told her about a reporter who had asked if she was \u201cready to be a role model,\u201d as if role model were a coat you could try on and then accept out of duty.\n\n\u201cI told him I\u2019m ready to be a person who buys crisps and reheats pasta twice,\u201d Nova said. \u201cHe looked like I\u2019d failed a test.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou passed the only one that counts,\u201d Maisie said. \u201cWant a sausage roll? It travels well.\u201d\n\nThey ate sitting on carpet that was currently a universe. Albie came out of his room in socks and a T-shirt that said \u201cBe Nice or Leave\u201d and sat down without asking because that was the kind of friendship they had built in three days\u2014that of people who pretended they were not making a raft in the middle of a river. He showed them a video of a woman in Blackpool singing his song into a hairbrush and wept with laughter until the housekeeper peeped around the corner to ask if they needed more towels for their emotional support.\n\nOut of habit, when the noise thinned, Maisie reached for the notebook that had been everywhere with her since the day she could afford notebooks that didn\u2019t fall apart at the spine. She flicked to a page where she had written in a train hand: corridor, bones, jam. She thought about next week with the clarity of a person who has run a bath and intends to get into it this time. The producers had sent a list of suggested songs, none of which were wrong, all of which had the shine of a song that had won something for somebody else. She wanted to sing something that did not ask permission. Something that tasted of wind and undercoat paint and clear, sharp mornings. Dan had told her to think about a song with a sliding melody that found her vowels and made them work for it. She thought of one she had sung once in an empty church for the sake of acoustics and stubbornness. It had a chorus that didn\u2019t pretend to be anything it wasn\u2019t. She wrote the title in the margin and underlined it twice. She would have to fight for it. She was more ready for a fight than she had been before the dog and the tart and the sentence.\n\nIn the small hours she woke to the sound the city makes when it turns over and goes back to sleep. She lay and listened as if the walls had something to confess. She thought of the message with its five words and put them in her mouth like pebbles. Proud anyway, proud anyway. It was a kind sentence wearing a shirt that didn\u2019t fit. She hadn\u2019t asked for it and she wouldn\u2019t build a house out of it. But she let it sit in the chair for a minute with a blanket around it before she showed it to the door. Then, because there was work to do and cheeks to wash and muscles to coax, she closed her eyes and walked the corridor in her head again. She put her hand to the door and she pushed and this time it swung easily. The room was the room. The light was the light. The floor was the friendly river. And she, who had sung to spoons and dogs and the invisible woman at the back of the room, stepped forward and breathed and saved nothing for later.Chapter Six\n\nThe morning they called it a brand, she laughed and then realised nobody else was laughing. The room had one wall of polite glass and one wall of a whiteboard where somebody had drawn arrows from her name to words like \u201cauthentic,\u201d \u201cseaside,\u201d and \u201crelatable.\u201d Someone had also drawn a gull and given it sunglasses. Executive wore a shirt the colour of meetings and spoke about \u201cowning the niche\u201d as though a seaside town were a cloud storage account. Lorna sat with a pen poised in the air as if it were a small bridge she might put down. Saj leaned against the radiator that didn\u2019t work but performed radiator as a role, and watched Maisie as if she were a person she could trust to name a fire.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thinking power ballad this week,\u201d said Executive, undeterred by the presence of the radiator. \u201cKeep the arc upward. Uplift. Give us the note again, but higher, longer, sustained. We\u2019ll put you in something white that looks like sincerity under lights. Maybe wind. The audience loves wind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love wind,\u201d Maisie said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s outside doing what it does. I was thinking something smaller. Slower. A song that knows how to talk, not shout. We could do it spare. A guitar or a piano and a space big enough for the words to sit down. It has a slide in it I can stand on. It\u2019s not\u2014\u201d She searched for the word that wasn\u2019t old-fashioned or timid or niche. \u201cIt\u2019s not loud. But it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nExecutive smiled in the way of men who understand trains and not tides. \u201cWe can make truth loud,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s our job. We help people hear it.\u201d\n\nDan, who had arrived with a coffee and the expression of a person who knows bad posture when he sees it, cleared his throat. \u201cHer instrument loves room,\u201d he said, in a tone that disguised advocacy as technical advice. \u201cIf we put too many notes around her, we\u2019ll steal the air. Let her carry quiet. It will read.\u201d\n\nSaj said nothing and then said something. \u201cThe clip from the caf\u00e9 is at a million,\u201d she offered, as if dropping a biscuit into a teacup to see whether it would sink. \u201cPeople are saying they can hear the kettle. They like that. If we make her into weather, they\u2019ll say we changed the forecast.\u201d She directed a look at Executive like a post-it, brightly-coloured and square. \u201cWe can save wind for later. The warehouse has not run out.\u201d\n\nThere was a small silence. The whiteboard gull stared into a future it could not control. Executive tapped the pen he had borrowed from nobody. Lorna wrote down something that could have been \u201cspare arrangement?\u201d or \u201cspare eyebrow?\u201d or \u201cremember to breathe,\u201d her shorthand as ambiguous as air. Finally, Executive gave a little shrug you could translate as a green light if you were trained in optimism. \u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cSpare. But not dull. And we need a moment for camera. The camera is part of the choir.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll teach it harmony,\u201d Maisie said. \u201cGive me the song and the room, and I\u2019ll bring it to the lens.\u201d\n\nOut in the corridor, with its carpet that had opinions about suitcases, Saj fell into step with her. \u201cYou held the line,\u201d she murmured. \u201cGood. The line exists because you drew it. We will find you a guitarist who listens.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a guitarist in mind,\u201d said Maisie, thinking of Albie\u2019s hands on a fretboard like someone deciding how to love something properly. \u201cIf we\u2019re allowed to keep it in-house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are allowed,\u201d Saj said. \u201cThe rules are permeable when applied with confidence.\u201d\n\nWord threaded down the day, through the hall like a piece of gossip that had decided to be helpful. Albie came to the rehearsal room with a guitar that had the dings of a useful life and said, \u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d in a voice that asked both about chords and friendship. Nova sat cross-legged on a case and watched with her chin in her hand, her eyes doing the quick moving of somebody who was building a memory to keep. Dan stood by the piano like a person at a bar he trusted.\n\nThey played the first verse as if the floor might break. Albie found the slide she had promised and rode it down into gentle. The melody unfurled with the weight of nothing more than honesty. There was a moment where the line hit a vowel that asked her to remember a kitchen that smelt of steam and lemon paint, and she widened it the way she had been taught and the air became something she could see. Dan nodded without showing his teeth and scratched a note on his page. Nova let out a small, involuntary \u201coh,\u201d which told Maisie she had been brave enough and only that.\n\n\u201cAgain,\u201d Dan said, soft enough that it wasn\u2019t an order. \u201cThis time let the breath sit behind the words like a chair you\u2019re willing to use.\u201d\n\nThey ran it until the furniture of it knew her. They tried the bridge with a different shape under it and then returned to the shape her body chose first. They argued about nothing in particular that meant everything\u2014capo or not, rubato here or there, whether a heartbeat should be left in or taken out. It became not a plan but a place. It became a corridor she could walk down and find a door open.\n\nThe clip from Eastbourne aired that afternoon in the hour before a news bulletin full of necessary sorrow and football. The dog was a star in three time zones by tea. Mrs. Pike became a meme with the caption \u201cmouth that does good work,\u201d which, to her credit, she didn\u2019t mind once she understood that people were laughing with her and not at her. The boy with the skateboard texted her a photograph of his gran pointing at the telly with a wooden spoon like it had offended her and then hugging it. The caf\u00e9 was busier for an hour than it had any right to be at four-fifteen, and Jai sent a video of himself doing a mock-press conference at the counter, answering questions from customers with a colander as a microphone. \u201cNo, we will not be selling dog-eaten pastries,\u201d he said, perfectly pompous. \u201cYes, you may take a photograph of the jam. No, I cannot reveal our tart supplier; she wears a cape and comes in at night.\u201d\n\nLen refused to be filmed live because \u201cI don\u2019t do television that talks back,\u201d but he allowed Maureen to record him on a phone raising a cup of tea in salute. The video had his slipper in it and half his face, which only increased its charm. Her mother sent a message that said, in its entirety, He stole a tart and spared the crust, which I think is a metaphor for men, followed by three kisses and a shopping list of things she thought might be necessary for Fame, including a lint roller and humility.\n\nBy evening there were three vans outside the hotel and a man with a camera who was not attached to a call sheet. He had the stance of a person who trusted himself to be disliked. When she came through the revolving door with Nova and their day packaged neatly under their arms, he took four photographs with the speed of someone trying to win a prize at a fair. He called her name as if they had been introduced at a party ten years ago. \u201cMaisie,\u201d he said, almost kindly. \u201cGive us a smile. Give us a little chin. Give us an Eastbourne.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t stop long enough to decide whether to be clever. She gave him the chin she was born with and the smile she had rented from a kind day and the straight back that came from needing to walk through noise. Saj materialised between lenses and said, \u201cNo questions tonight, lads,\u201d in a voice that had a velvet rope built into it. Nova walked butterfly-gentle but kept going. In the lift, breath caught up with them, ripped its tights, swore, and then pretended it hadn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cDo I have to learn how to walk from the car to the door?\u201d Nova asked, pulling her hair into a shape that did not declare defeat.\n\n\u201cYou already know,\u201d Maisie said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same walk as to the stage. You pretend the ground is your friend and you don\u2019t say sorry to anyone you don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cTeach a class,\u201d Nova said, and then, because they could, they took each other\u2019s hands for the sixty seconds to the seventh floor.\n\nThe week did what weeks do when they are full: it grew a second spine and held everything up anyway. Rehearsals were disciplined and kind until they weren\u2019t, because someone hadn\u2019t slept or a screen had failed to do the right picture at the right time or an intern put the wrong name on the wrong sandwich. People said, \u201cAll good,\u201d and meant \u201cmostly good.\u201d People said, \u201cWe move,\u201d and meant \u201cwe refuse to drown.\u201d Dan was a metronome and a priest and a man with a spare cough sweet in his pocket. Lorna had an argument in the hall with a person whose job could be summarised as \u201cNo,\u201d and walked away with a small smile you could not help but admire. Saj kept the doors opening at the right moment and the wrong ones locked and the phones pointed away from hearts. Executive came and peered and nodded and left, as if he were an eagle pretending to be a pigeon.\n\nThe day of the show she woke brittle and then softened under tea. She did the ridiculous mouth shapes while drying her hair, and her reflection in the hotel mirror did them back with a straight face, which felt like solidarity. In the breakfast room, a man from another world told her he loved her dress without looking up from his eggs; she said thank you, then remembered she wasn\u2019t wearing it and laughed into her toast. Nova had slept badly and wore it like eyeliner. Albie was already at the piano on his floor when she wandered through and he said, without pausing his hands, \u201cI\u2019ve got you,\u201d which she believed the way you believe gravity when you step.\n\nThey dressed her in the blue again because the dress had decided to be a friend. Hair moved but did not rustle. Someone glued a wire behind her ear in a way that felt like trust. Saj handed her a note card with three questions she might be asked and three answers she would not give, because some things did not belong to twenty cameras and the internet\u2019s morning-after. One was about her father. One was about whether she had a boyfriend. One was about whether she had a plan for losing, as if losing were a place with a map and a gift shop. She slid the card into her shoe like a talisman and took two stupidly deep breaths that made Dan nod approvingly from across the room like a man who had been consulted and found his advice obeyed.\n\nIn the lineup, in the wings, there was a smell of hairspray and nerves fried in butter. The girl with the peach hair, Nova\u2019s new friend called Tansy, whispered that she had forgotten how to count and hoped counting wasn\u2019t involved. A stagehand with tattoos of ships on his forearms called them \u201csweethearts\u201d without being demeaning and set them on their marks with the gentleness of a person putting bread in an oven. The host glanced at his cue cards as if they were written in a language he had learned for money. The lights rose into their useful joy. Someone in the audience already had a sign with Maisie\u2019s name on it that glinted like a lake. She wanted, just for a charcoal second, to be the person in the audience holding a sign for someone else.\n\nAlbie looked at her across the black river of the stage like a man about to swim with his guitar as a buoy. He did a small nod that looked like a spell. The red light went from friendly to important. The music started, not louder than conversation, but intimate, like a cousin. The room came close, the way rooms do when they are listening properly. She sang the first line as if there were only one person to hear it and that person wasn\u2019t her. The words sat where she\u2019d put chairs for them. The second line had a drop like a small hill on a bicycle. She didn\u2019t wobble. She didn\u2019t apologise. She did as Dan had asked and let her breath be behind the word like a chair she trusted. In the bridge, something shifted that had nothing to do with microphones and everything to do with permission. She gave herself more and the room came closer and then stepped back, respecting the distance, a dance taught without teaching.\n\nThe camera was there when she glanced for it, not a predator, not a friend, but an eye doing its job. She gave it a moment not choreographed\u2014a tiny smile at a place where a smile didn\u2019t belong, because she\u2019d heard a woman in the front row sigh for a reason she didn\u2019t know. Albie\u2019s fingers did the slide that had felt like a question and now was an answer. The last note did not need to be as high as last week\u2019s or as long. It needed to be clean and true and unafraid, and so it was. The quiet afterwards was the kind of quiet that proves noise exists.\n\nThey didn\u2019t whoop like she was a feat of engineering. They breathed out like they had been held and then released. Somewhere a man coughed because he had forgotten how not to. Backstage, Nova hugged her with eyes wet that she refused to acknowledge as wet. Dan did the circle again and added a second circle, which was not a thing he did often. Saj pressed her hand once as if transferring a spell. Lorna\u2019s grin had real teeth in it. Executive gave a thumbs-up you could tell he had practised in a mirror and did not mind being seen practising.\n\nThe judges did their dance. One talked about control as if it were a horse. Another talked about authenticity and nearly meant it. The third corrected a word that did not need correcting and then said something about Eastbourne that was almost accurate. She thanked them with the grace of a person taking a compliment and returning the wrapping. The host tried to make her say the phrase \u201cjourney\u201d and she gave him \u201cweek\u201d instead, which he pocketed like a coin and moved on to a person with a bigger hairpiece.\n\nIn the chaos just before results, Saj pulled her into the little quiet room that had already learned her shape. \u201cTwo things,\u201d she said, leaning on the door so softly it didn\u2019t know it was being asked to help. \u201cOne: they love the dog. That\u2019s helpful news. Two: a reporter is asking about the message. The \u2018I heard you. Proud anyway\u2019 one. They mention a name you have not used. I have said, \u2018No comment.\u2019 We can say, \u2018Private.\u2019 We can say, \u2018Irrelevant.\u2019 Or we can say nothing, which is a verb. The choice is yours and also mine, but I ask you first.\u201d\n\nThe room tipped a little, the way a boat does when a wave passes under it and the captain doesn\u2019t flinch. Maisie felt the five words in the pocket of her cardigan though they were not physically there. She thought of the man on the promenade offering her a hole to climb into, of the cake and the crust and the dog who shared what he didn\u2019t need. She thought of her mother and the recorder and the drawer that hummed. She thought of thirteen and of seventeen and of twenty-two, and of how being watched was not the same as being seen.\n\n\u201cSay nothing,\u201d she said, with a steadiness that surprised the part of her that had wanted to be generous to strangers. \u201cSay I\u2019m at work. Say the kettle\u2019s on.\u201d\n\n\u201cDone,\u201d Saj said, touching her shoulder in a way that felt like a small medal pinned inside a jacket. \u201cAnd if anyone asks you, you can say, \u2018Not today.\u2019 It\u2019s a full sentence.\u201d\n\nThe results came like the sea\u2014inevitable, dramatic if you stood in the wrong place, and wet with other people\u2019s feelings. The lights remembered how to frighten. Names were called as if they were doors opening and closing in a corridor where you had left coats. Albie went through and looked back once as if this were a game of statues and not career. Nova\u2019s name was late enough that Maisie\u2019s stomach found religion. When it came, Nova made the soft-gasp noise of a person who has postponed a cry and it leaked anyway. Maisie\u2019s name arrived in the middle, not early enough to be arrogance, not late enough to be a story. They stood together because that was what they\u2019d decided to do, two girls from nationally different corners of the same need, and when a boy with too much certainty did not get called, they made room for his sadness without absorbing it.\n\nAfterwards, under the crush of hair and wire and human, she found the corridor that had become hers. It smelt like paint cooling and luck. Her phone was where she had left it with the face turned away. She let it stay that way for a minute longer. She let herself lean against the wall as if the wall were something like home. Saj appeared with crisps, which was a kind of sacrament. Dan appeared with sense, which was another. Lorna appeared with paperwork and love disguised as a list. \u201cThere will be more of them now,\u201d she said, meaning vans and lenses and questions and hands. \u201cThere is a percentage of them who will remember they are people and a percentage who will forget. We surround you with the first and keep the second as far as possible. If any of them say \u2018journey\u2019 at you more than once, I am authorised to hiss.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can hiss,\u201d Maisie said. \u201cI hissed at a man once who put his finger into a cake to check it was real.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did he respond,\u201d Lorna asked, looking delighted, as if she were collecting souvenirs of resistance from the field.\n\n\u201cHe apologised to the cake,\u201d Maisie said, and the room, such as it was, laughed and the laughter did the thing it always does when it is honest: improved the air.\n\nBack at the hotel, late and not late, she took the pins out of her hair and put them on the desk in a pattern that could have been a constellation. She washed her face and watched her own skin return like a tide that knew its times. She sat on the bed with her knees up and the duvet compressed under her like the lap of a giant and she allowed herself ten minutes to watch the clip with the dog again, because sometimes the soft thing is the medicine. She texted her mother: Not today, and her mother replied: Well done. There is trifle.\n\nShe wrote in the notebook because if she didn\u2019t, the day would have nowhere to live and might turn into gas. She wrote: I held the quiet and it held me back. She wrote: Wind later. She wrote: Say nothing is a sentence. She drew a dog that looked like a seagull wearing boots and laughed at herself alone in a high room.\n\nSleep came as if it had been watching and waiting for its cue. At three she woke as always and listened to the city shifting its shoulder in the sheets. She thought about the next song without deciding anything. She allowed herself a little luxury and imagined an after that involved a stage she chose, a band that knew her vowels and didn\u2019t ask them to change, a small tour of seaside places where the gulls would pretend to know the choruses, and a caf\u00e9 she could return to in the mornings to dry spoons and be told she was still part of the furniture. She let the image be generous without making promises it couldn\u2019t keep.\n\nIn the morning, the vans were still there and the man with the camera had been replaced by a man with a microphone whose hair looked as if it had been argued with into shape. Downstairs in the lobby a little girl approached wearing a coat the colour of apples and a courage that had been sewn on by somebody careful. She held out a napkin on which she had drawn, in pencil, a person with a big mouth and a dog with a bigger one. \u201cThis is you,\u201d she said, without self-consciousness. \u201cAnd this is the dog. He likes your voice.\u201d\n\nMaisie took the napkin like it was paper and then held it like it was porcelain. \u201cWill you sign it for me,\u201d she asked the girl, because that was the only correct response. The girl wrote her name in the middle of the dog with the seriousness children give to important work. Her mother hovered in the distance, instructing the air to be kind. \u201cThank you,\u201d Maisie said, with the weight such a small transaction deserved. \u201cYou\u2019ve made my day before tea.\u201d\n\nThey had a day off in the schedule, which meant a day in which fewer people would ask her to stand here or be that. She walked a stretch of river with Nova and declined to be photographed on a bench by a man whose camera had learned to forget faces. They went into a museum and looked at paintings of skies, all different, and wondered how it is that people can love the same thing fifty ways. They ate chips from paper and blessed salt aloud as if it were a minor god. They did not talk about fathers or fear. They talked about fruit they didn\u2019t like as children and fruit they pretended to like now, trilobites and haircuts and a woman on the bus who had knitted a hat for the weather and then the weather had decided to change and she wore it cheerful anyway.\n\nBy the time rehearsals resumed, the dog had done two morning shows and one biscuit advert without knowing it. Eastbourne had broken the till drawer twice with the weight of coins. Mrs. Pike had acquired an apron with the words \u201cMouth That Does Good Work\u201d embroidered by a woman who did embroidery when her cat allowed it, and had worn it ironically which, for Mrs. Pike, meant only that she acknowledged it existed. The boy with the skateboard was learning to make coffee without Jai saying \u201cNo, see, tilt,\u201d and the terrier had started sitting outside the Driftwood as if expecting applause. Len had discovered emojis and sent her three of a letter and one of a fish and one of a man who could only be a postman if you believed in miracles. Her mother had sent her a photograph of a trifle that had become a landscape, which she praised without admitting she preferred crumble.\n\nAt the end of that week\u2019s first run-through, Dan stopped her on the way out with a hand that asked only a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re getting good at not apologising,\u201d he said, and the twinkle was only half a twinkle. \u201cWatch for the apology creeping into the smile. It\u2019s a British habit. You can smile without giving something back. Try it in front of the mirror and you\u2019ll see yourself grow half an inch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see myself enough,\u201d she said, but she took it, because he was right and because the work was a thing she liked to hold. In the stairwell between floors she practised two smiles, one that gave away bus fares and the other that didn\u2019t, and was astonished at the difference it made to her own breath. A stagehand coming up with a coil of tape saw her and gave her a look that said, We all try things in stairwells, and kept going.\n\nThere was a night midweek when the hotel felt like the inside of a clock and she went to the bar with the carpet that hid more than it revealed and found a corner where she could be a person having a drink and not a person being assessed. A man came over with the careful tilt of someone with something to say and she braced, then relaxed. It was the camera guy who had laughed with his mouth closed. He said, \u201cThat second verse was clean,\u201d and then, because he was smart, he didn\u2019t say more. She raised her glass and he raised his and they did not talk about anything that could be monetised. It was a relief the size of a thousand small things.\n\nIn bed that night she thought briefly of the message with its five words and for the first time it did not make her ribs flutter. It sat in the corner like a coat nobody was wearing, and that was fine. She slept and dreamed not of the pier in lights but of the caf\u00e9 with the bell that worked and tea towels as prizes and a dog who stole something you cared for and somehow improved it by making it a story. In the morning, she woke and the day organised itself obediently into breakfast, breath, stage, and the kind of work that feels like you could spend your life doing it without minding the weather. She sat for make-up and let someone paint on bravery that matched the bravery she brought and thought, quietly and without theatre, I am doing the thing, and if there was ever a sentence worth getting out of bed for, that was it.Chapter Eight began with a newspaper on a breakfast table that did not belong to her, a photograph cropped so closely it felt like a hand over a mouth. She didn\u2019t see it first. A man at the next table rearranged his cutlery into a domestic constellation and tutted at the headline as if the letters had personally misbehaved, then rotated the paper and left the page where anyone could read it, the way people leave half-eaten fruit for birds and tell themselves it\u2019s charity. There was her face, but tighter, and a name beside it she had kept in a drawer with batteries and things you don\u2019t throw away in case fate requires you to prove you once believed in them. The caption did the thing captions do when they want to be both a knife and a handkerchief. It said Proud anyway, as if generosity were a stain that would not come out.\n\nSaj appeared in the breakfast room as if she\u2019d been hiding behind the croissants, which was a trick Maisie wouldn\u2019t put past her. She set down a small pot of jam like a bargaining chip and didn\u2019t look at the paper, which was exactly the kindness required. \u201cWe\u2019re handling it,\u201d she said, in a voice that had the weight of a person placing a lid on a boiling pan. \u201cLegal will call the desk. We say nothing except that you\u2019re at work, which you are, and that your family is not a storyline, which it isn\u2019t. If anybody thrusts a microphone at your mouth with the question, I will place my hand between the microphone and the question, and they will interview my palm. Eat something that forgives you while we do that.\u201d\n\nIt was a neat plan, as most good plans are when they are drawn on clean air before the weather gets involved. The paper was only the first welcome committee. In the lobby, a man with a camera and a boy with a notebook hopped from one foot to the other as if the carpet were lava and only the question could save them. Outside, a van sat like a patient predator, windows darkened to imply important thoughts being had about your life. In her phone, the message multiplied, copied, pasted, embellished, picked up by the pieces of the internet that pretend to be neighbours and love to borrow your sugar. Uncles she\u2019d never met wrote paragraphs about duty and daughters under photos from last summer of a choir in a park, and schoolfriends she hadn\u2019t spoken to since GCSEs suddenly remembered she existed and had always known she was special. Her mother texted: I am not answering the door. Maureen is on guard. We have deployed a tray of biscuits as distraction if necessary. The biscuits are brave.\n\nShe did not cry because crying would have given it a shape, and she refused to hand over architecture to strangers. She ate toast slowly and imagined the toast as an ally, which worked as well as anything. Nova slid into the chair with all the grace of a person who had just been told she looked good in a colour she hated. \u201cThey\u2019ve found my dad too,\u201d she said, light as paper. \u201cDifferent paper, different haircut, same hunger. Saj says to say nothing. I am good at saying nothing when I care. I am not good at saying nothing when I do not care, which is strange.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the river and ignore bridges,\u201d Maisie said, as if rivers were something you could schedule. \u201cFive minutes, then we will come back and behave like a people who live on taped-down marks. We will breathe and pretend there is only room for oxygen.\u201d\n\nThey walked as far as the metal railings and the morning performing its good behaviour. The city presented its best concrete and its least threatening pigeons and three joggers in a row considered not being in the way and failed. It was enough to reset the little gears that had jumped in her chest when she saw the headline. On the way back, a woman passed them carrying a florist\u2019s box that had been designed for the delivery of softness. She stopped, looked at Maisie with a face that did not edit, and said, \u201cYou sang and I felt myself stand up inside,\u201d then went on her way because people have lives, because that is the only thing keeping the world upright.\n\nIn the rehearsal room the piano was already open at the page that made room for knees. Dan stood as if he were about to tell good news in a saner world, and Albie had his guitar in the lap position that means the day is willing. They all knew enough to ignore the buzzing. Work, if you let it, grows hands and shields you because it wants to be done. They went through the song for the third time like people carrying cups carefully. They shaved half a second off a pause not because anyone would notice but because they would, and the noticing would make them sit straighter just before the line that needed straightening. They tried the bridge again with a tilt, and finally the melody accepted their offer. When she sang the line about going home and not meaning geography, she felt the sound sit perfectly in the middle of her mouth and stay there, polite and obstinate.\n\nA runner appeared with a message on a laminated card like a prophecy that had to be wiped between uses. It said MEDIA HOLD: FIRM. Lorna poked her head around the door next, hair doing its two-tasks-at-once thing, and said, \u201cExecutive wants you to do a soft thank-you to \u2018everyone who\u2019s reached out\u2019 when you\u2019re on the couch. Not the name. Not the story. Just a thank-you. You don\u2019t have to. We can ignore it. But if it will help them feel fed and leave you alone, we can try. Your call.\u201d She didn\u2019t look at the paper in her hand that had the word \u201cnarrative\u201d on it in clean type. She looked at Maisie the way you look at a fire that might go everywhere and might also go out and not be the end of the world.\n\n\u201cI can do a thank-you that\u2019s also a do-not,\u201d Maisie said, trying her mouth around the balance and feeling it hold. \u201cI can do a handful of politeness without selling the kitchen. I will talk about kindness and cakes and doors. I will talk about doors.\u201d\n\n\u201cTalk about doors,\u201d Lorna said, with the same small relief she had when a mic worked the first time. \u201cDoors are out of fashion. You can bring them back.\u201d\n\nThe day seemed to have decided not to be generous, so it gave them oddness instead. Halfway through a lighting check, the wind machine for another act fell in love with the switch and refused to be turned off. A, B and C plan tried to coax it back into friendship, and finally a man called Kev, who had the shoulders of a man who had convinced many objects to behave, murmured to it in a soft Midlands tone and the thing sighed and gave up drama. In the corridor, Nova practised wink-smiling at her reflection and announced she was terrible at wink-smiling and would therefore invent a new expression that meant \u201cI am pleased to be here but nobody owns my eyebrows.\u201d In the break room someone had put out a bowl of bananas with a sign that said \u201cPLEASE EAT ME,\u201d then someone else had crossed out \u201cME\u201d and written \u201cBANANAS,\u201d and this was somehow exactly the size of joke everyone could handle.\n\nThe caf\u00e9 clip was still rising like bread left in a warm room. Mrs. Pike had sent a photograph of herself with a man from the council in front of the pastry display. The man had his serious tie on and a grin like the top of a lighthouse and was shaking hands with a tray. The caption, in Jai\u2019s handwriting, said: Council recognises tart\u2019s contribution to civic morale. The terrier had, according to the boy with the skateboard, been recognised twice on the seafront with the phrase \u201cThere he is,\u201d which had made the dog look over his shoulder as if perhaps the other he was just behind him. Len sent no commentary, just a photograph of the horizon sliced by a gull and underneath it a row of stamps lined up like teeth, which was either an accident or a poem.\n\nBy the time the red light woke properly for the live part, Maisie had reached the calm that comes not from courage but from the body being sensible. She took her place as if she had been born there and left twice and returned because it was the only reasonable choice. The stage had been made into the kind of room her song needed, which is to say the room was acting like a room and not a spaceship. Albie\u2019s face had settled into that calm he inherited from older women and boats. The audience had arranged themselves into one large listening creature. She sang, and the note that mattered came out dressed like itself and not a guest, and she did not think of newspapers except in the way you think of ships when you are on a field; as a different kind of distance.\n\nThe trouble came two bars from the end, when the monitor in her ear misheard the world and threw back a sound that wasn\u2019t hers. It was the kind of mistake that makes people bargain with physics. She saw Dan\u2019s head turn in the darkness, saw Albie\u2019s neck muscle twitch at the edge of the last chord, saw the floor conduct calm. She did the thing you do when a kettle suddenly stops sounding like a kettle. She took the earpiece out, quick, one motion, and put it in her palm like an egg. She stepped half an inch closer to the mouth of the room, which is to say the audience, and trusted that air is not just an absence. For four bars she sang naked of equipment and the room remembered it had been built to carry voices before it was taught to react to cameras. It carried her. The note found the ceiling and did not get lost on the way back. When she finished, the quiet that followed the quiet was generous. Somewhere a headset muttered a swear of admiration in an accent you could not quite place.\n\nBackstage, people who were paid to be calm allowed themselves miniature celebrations, the luxury of impressed eyebrows and professional smiles that almost broke into parties. Dan pressed her shoulder in the exact place that said \u201cwork\u201d and \u201cwell done,\u201d and Lorna told her she would never mention wind again in relation to Executive\u2019s dreams. Saj handed her water that had been cold in an intelligent way and said, \u201cI think you just started a trend called \u2018remembering how to human.\u2019 If they ask you about it, it was a technical. If they ask you about the paper, doors.\u201d\n\nOn the couch, under lights that pretend to be scrutiny and are mostly heat, she did her thank-you. She thanked people for messages that were kind and said nothing about the ones that were not and did not at any point perform an anecdote. She spoke about spoons and kettles and doors, and the host tried to turn spoons into fathers because that is what hosts must try to do if they want to keep their chair. She took the word back and made it about tea, and the audience, which is a clever animal when trained, made the noise people make when they recognise someone refusing a story without being rude to the furniture. It was, in the scale of victories, small enough to fit in a coat pocket, and important enough to hold warm with your hands.\n\nThat night the vans multiplied at the kerb like mushrooms after rain. Saj reorganised exits like a general who had never lost a battle because she refused to fight one she couldn\u2019t win. In the revolving door a man in a coat that didn\u2019t fit tried a question with her name on it and she smiled with the correct ratio of teeth to restraint and said, \u201cNot today,\u201d and walked, and the walk was a kind of language. Upstairs, the corridor did its good work of purring. Nova texted a string of emojis that appeared to mean either \u201cI have discovered eyeliner\u201d or \u201cI have tamed a mythical beast,\u201d and then arrived and threw herself on the bed as if gravity were optional. \u201cYou witch,\u201d she said, full of love that was relief. \u201cYou made an accident look like a choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a choice,\u201d Maisie said. \u201cThe choice not to panic. It turns out I have a choice. I have more choices than I thought. I might start choosing for sport.\u201d\n\n\u201cChoose chips,\u201d Nova said, already half asleep in a position that would make a chiropractor sigh, and then said, blurred, \u201cThey\u2019re going to make you talk about him again. Just\u2026 don\u2019t be the soup. Be the bowl.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a bowl,\u201d Maisie said, which in another life would have been an odd sentence to say to a friend while both were fully clothed, but here, in this life, was doctrine. She tucked a blanket over Nova as if preparing a small animal for hibernation. Then she sat in the chair by the window, because chairs in hotel rooms are there for people to sit in while remembering. A small square envelope was tucked under the door in that particular way hotel staff manage when they want you to believe magic still exists. There was a neat hand on the front that belonged to nobody in her modern life, the slanted script that predates keyboards. Inside was a recipe card, stained with butter in a corner, for jam tarts. The ingredients were in Len\u2019s slow capitals, each line a kindness. At the bottom, he had written: Remember the crust holds the jam and not the other way round. Under that, like a PS that had slipped out of the mouth of the first sentence: Also, I told the man at the gate that he was trespassing on my good mood. He apologised to my hedges.\n\nShe slept with the card under her pillow, which did nothing and also did everything. In the morning, the paper had become other papers, and the van had become a different van. The city wore yesterday as a scarf and considered the day with a professional face. Saj had arranged a decoy exit and three decoy smiles and an actual one for luck. In the lift, a housekeeper with a trolley full of beautifully folded forgiveness looked at Maisie and then away and then back and said, \u201cYou were brave when the ear thing went,\u201d in the tone a person uses to name a colour when paint has dried. It was a small ribbon she pinned to her inside.\n\nThe day off that wasn\u2019t off landed unexpectedly in the schedule like snow that had looked on the forecast and decided to be less trouble. It rained politely, the sort of rain that wants to be liked. She went to Eastbourne because she could. The train did not object. The platform received her without applause, which was a relief so pure it made her clumsy for a second. She walked through the underpass and the town opened itself like it always had, indifferent to fame and gossip and heavily stapled schedules, and therefore a kind of church.\n\nAt the Driftwood, Jai had constructed a shrine to the dog consisting of a saucer with a single biscuit and a sign reading HONEST THIEF. Mrs. Pike swatted away a camera crew from a show with a name that used the word celebrity as if it were a medical term and told them they could film the outside of her bun if they filed a request in writing. The boy with the skateboard reported that his gran had waved at her on the telly and then complained that the lighting wasn\u2019t flattering to their wallpaper, which meant she was feeling better. The terrier came in without being invited, because it had become impossible to tell that dog where to be, and it sat at her feet with the dignity of an animal who had been to London in spirit.\n\nShe made tea because sometimes being useful is more important than being adored. She wiped down a table because cloths are therapy with texture. A tourist from a motorway town said, \u201cOh, it really is you,\u201d as if she had been supposed to be an actor hired to play herself. She cut cake and talked about sugar with a woman who told her she had watched the performance from her hospital bed and had clapped so gently with the back of her hand that the nurse cried. She went down to the pier with Len because he consented to walk if the wind was in a giving mood and stopped at the part where the boards sound like music. He told her about a parcel that had arrived open and a note he had written that said, \u201cArrived in this condition,\u201d and the way the recipient had phoned to say thank you for the honesty. \u201cPeople think honesty is expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is cheaper than the alternative. Remember that when you are tempted to buy silence on credit.\u201d\n\nShe told him about the recipe card and he grinned like a boy and claimed no knowledge and then asked if the dog in question had forgiven the tart. On the way back, the man from the promenade saw her again and began a sentence with \u201cYour father\u2014\u201d and she stopped, and held up a hand like a person crossing a road at a zebra, and said, \u201cNot today,\u201d gently, like a person pointing out a cliff to a visitor, and he flushed, and he said, \u201cSorry, love,\u201d and they both carried on being human, which felt like a win on a day with rain.\n\nThe next show week had decided to be hard. The theme was not a theme but a box with \u201cbig songs\u201d printed on it in a font that made people feel unnecessary pressure. Executive wanted power and wind. The lights wanted to be edited into something that could be put online with a word like \u201ciconic.\u201d Dan wanted vowels and rest and a room. Saj wanted doors. Maisie wanted the exact smallness she could hold without giving away her bones. They compromised by building something that felt like a streetlight at dusk. She chose an older song that had nothing to prove and therefore proved everything. Executive raised an eyebrow that had been paid for and asked if perhaps a medley might be more commercial, and she said, \u201cI am not a medley,\u201d which made Lorna snort into her notes because she treasured every sentence that forced the room to be sharper than it had been.\n\nAlbie\u2019s week had sharp corners. He had been bottom two for reasons outside of talent and inside of fate, and he was tired in his eyes, which is the kind of tired that retinol cannot touch. He smiled and said, \u201cWe move,\u201d which meant \u201cI will stand up even if my knees are bored,\u201d and his hands did beautiful things to the guitar that you only notice if you have ever tried to make a thing respond to being asked nicely. Nova had been assigned a costume that looked like a metaphor and refused to wear it, which led to a corridor conversation that ended with her wearing trousers and a grin that scared three men and a frog. They all stopped to eat at a table designed by a person who believed elbows are rude, and they put their elbows on it with intent, and that small act of rebellion tasted exactly like chips would have tasted if the rehearsal had finished on time.\n\nThe show went as shows do when more people are watching: like an animal trained to accept noise in exchange for food. There were better songs than the songs deserved and worse ones than talent allowed. There was a boy who forgot a line and remembered grace. There was a woman with a dress that had opinions and an audience that adored it. When it was Maisie\u2019s turn, the room gave her the courtesy of filling the right places and not the wrong ones. She looked at Albie across the stage and felt for a second what it would be like to do this without him, and she had to breathe twice before the first line would come. She sang and the song did what old songs do when asked by a new mouth; it yielded and it argued and in the end it sat down beside her and shared the view.\n\nThe judges found adjectives in their pockets and some of them were the right ones. The host asked her if being \u201cour caf\u00e9 songbird\u201d felt like a responsibility, and she said it felt like a shift rota, and there was laughter in the right places. When the results came, they came like the tide only if the tide had to pause and listen to a sponsor. Albie\u2019s name was late. It was the kind of late that makes you count the names you can\u2019t see and reckon odds and push down doom with your knee. When it came, it did not come. He stood well. He went to sing for his life with steady hands and a throat that did not betray him, and still the room and the maths and the map of the week decided otherwise. He bowed like a boat at a dock because he knew how to leave with dignity and without interpretation. He hugged her and his arms said the thing his mouth couldn\u2019t say because not crying in public is a game people play even when the rules hurt. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it,\u201d he said, the exact three words he had to give away, and then he went off in the manner of men taught by older women, which is to say upright and unblaming.\n\nShe didn\u2019t sleep much that night. Sleep was there, hovering with the bedside lamp and the hotel pen and the usual humility, but every time she reached it, a thought tugged her sleeve and asked if she had remembered to be kind, if she had stolen any lines, if she could have argued harder for anything that mattered, if she could bear doing this without the steady companionship of a guitar that understood her more than some people would. At three, a message arrived from Len like a lighthouse blink. It said: Boats leave. Harbours remain. Don\u2019t turn into a harbour. Be a boat with a kettle. It was the strangest, dearest sentence, and somehow it allowed her to close her eyes with something like peace.\n\nMorning did not ask permission. It found her and put tea in her hand and sent her downstairs to a room where Executive had drawn new arrows on the whiteboard. The gull had acquired an expression. There was a fresh plan for a duet week that involved pairing her with someone whose name made publicity men purr. Lorna was going to find the boat. Dan had already located his replacement, a house guitarist with long fingers and listening ears who introduced himself as Marta and shook her hand like a promise. Saj wrote DOORS in the corner and underlined it until the pen made a squeak that sounded like victory.\n\nThey went to the river because the city had given them one that morning and it seemed ungrateful not to look. Nova walked with her hands in her pockets as if pockets had been designed to hold courage. \u201cAre you all right,\u201d she asked, because asking is work too, and Maisie said, \u201cI am sad and I am grateful and I am still wanting to sing,\u201d and that was the most honest inventory she was capable of. They paused on a bridge with the usual padlocks and all the ordinary tourists and it occurred to her that nothing remarkable was visible from that angle, that the remarkable was happening in a hundred kitchens and a thousand birds and in one girl from a town where the tide has opinions who had decided she would have them too.\n\nHer phone vibrated, not with a van or a paper or a man in a coat, but with the name she had left un-open like a cupboard that smells of something you aren\u2019t ready to face. It was not five words this time. It was two, and they were the only two that made sense and caused trouble in equal measure. It said: I\u2019m here. She looked at the words as if they were city pigeons, familiar and opportunistic. She was in a place with pigeons and also in a place where the gulls waited. She could not control which bird came closer. She slid the phone back into her pocket and let the words sit with the crumbs.\n\nThe caf\u00e9 sent her a photograph of a new chalkboard in Jai\u2019s carefully chaotic hand. It read: SOUP OF THE DAY: BOUNDARIES. COMES WITH BREAD. She sent back a drawing of a door with a lock and a heart and under it a kettle and the words I\u2019m a boat, and Jai replied with a string of sailor emojis that did not exist but should. She messaged Albie to say nothing at all in sentences and everything in spaces and he wrote back a picture of the sea near his mother\u2019s, flat as a sheet, and the phrase Play on, which could have been about music or life or the way some people give you exactly not enough and somehow it is enough.\n\nShe went to rehearsal and her feet found the floor and her mouth found the note and her breath found the chair behind the word. She stood on the mark that had had her name written on it so many times it had become part of the stage, and she looked up into lights that were trying their best and she said to herself under the noise and the plan and the want and the fear: I know my bones. She said it again, because there are sentences you are supposed to repeat until the room learns them with you. She imagined the Driftwood quiet with the day\u2019s last cups, the lemon paint forgiving faults the way good colours do, the dog asleep beside the door dreaming of tarts, Len turning off a light with the seriousness of a ceremony, her mother washing a spoon and thinking of old songs and nonsense, and she let the picture make a home for the bit of her that had room for no more newspapers.\n\nThe duet week was going to be a circus. It was the kind of television where somebody in a high room imagined chemistry like a chemical and then pretended it could be measured with ratings. They paired her with a man whose first name was enough, who had been loud ten years ago and then quieter and now loud again with the authority of a person who had sold both vinyl and streaming. He arrived in rehearsal in a jacket the colour of someone else\u2019s mood and hugged her like a cousin at a funeral and said, \u201cYou do your thing, I won\u2019t get in your way,\u201d which was either humility or a plan. His voice slid under hers like a hand under a plate; she could not tell yet if he would tilt or steady. They chose a song that did not make anyone roll their eyes, and they agreed on a key that did not betray either of their ageing frets. He told her a story about performing drunk in Hull in 2009 that had nothing to do with anything and somehow helped.\n\nLater, in the corridor with the carpet that forgave ridiculous shoes, she found Saj leaning against the radiator which still did not work. \u201cHow do you feel about tomorrow,\u201d Saj asked, not a producer now but a person with a face at the end of a day. \u201cI will not accept \u2018fine\u2019 unless it comes with evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like a chair with three good legs,\u201d Maisie said. \u201cIt stands but you shouldn\u2019t sit suddenly. I feel like a boat with a kettle. I feel like the city is starting to recognise my walk and I am getting proud of the way my ankles don\u2019t lie. I feel like if one more stranger says the word proud at me I will put it in a jar and label it and never open it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Saj said, which is to say she heard everything. \u201cWe will keep jars. We will keep labels. We will open the ones we choose when we choose. And if they ask you again on the couch about him, I will hiss, and you will be the bowl and not the soup, and we will go for chips that are salted like a religion and eat them in defiance of narrative.\u201d\n\nThey laughed, and the laugh repaired something you could not name. Then the building breathed, juddered, swallowed its own noise, laid out its corridors like a promise, and handed her back to the part of the story where the stage waits to see if you will betray it. She did not. She went on. She sang. The room did the thing. And outside, where vans learn the habits of foxes, the world watched and had opinions, as it always will, while somewhere with lemon paint and a bell that works and a dog who steals only what is worth telling, a kettle boiled, and boiled, and boiled.Chapter Ten\n\nThe week learned how to take up space and then did so without apology. It spread itself over days like a map on a table big enough for elbows, and everyone leaned in until their forearms made borders. The duet had aired and become a thousand small edits, some of which were kind and some of which wore kindness as a hat, and now the show had decided that the correct answer to noise was more music. Semi-finals were a word people said like superstition, not looking it directly in the eye in case it got ideas. The schedule developed muscles in new places. Someone put a whiteboard in a room that had never hosted a whiteboard and on it wrote words like momentum and jeopardy in handwriting that looked like the receiver of many emails.\n\nThe man with one name sent flowers that were the kind you suspect would sue if you overwatered them, along with a note that said, \u201cYou made me sing better, which is rude, but I forgive you.\u201d She left the bouquet where the runners could smell achievement and slid the card into her notebook as if it might learn to be a lyric if kept warm. Nova had slept through two alarms and woke with the complicated face of a person who had dreamt they were chased by microphones. Albie sent a photograph of a stage the size of a living room somewhere in a town without trains and the caption: Room was room. They clapped at the right places and someone cried in an honest way. He added a second message that said, in admirable defiance of the show\u2019s insistence on being everyone's mother: Eat. Drink. Breathe down not up.\n\nExecutive called a meeting in the room with polite glass and the whiteboard gull, now wearing a cape added by an unknown hand. He smiled the way a person smiles when they have bought the right cheese from the wrong shop and intend to serve it with panache. \u201cSemis,\u201d he said, and the word landed on the table and tried to look casual. \u201cWe want scale without silliness. We want intimacy that reads big. And we want an original. It\u2019s time. Can you deliver something that feels like you, but also like us, but more you than us, while still being us? Spare with a hook. Honest without liability. Maybe a key change if it doesn\u2019t make us look desperate.\u201d\n\nFor a second she thought she had misheard, that perhaps he had finally succumbed to the temptation of irony. Lorna tilted her head as if eavesdropping on an idea. Dan folded his arms the way choirs fold arms when the soloist is family. Saj breathed out between teeth in a way the building recognised as her preparing to run at a wall. \u201cYou want her to do her own song,\u201d Saj said, confirming the universe had not flipped. \u201cYou want her bones in a melody, on live television, with three rehearsals and a band that can learn anything but prefers to be respected. You want quiet that can be heard in rooms where people shout. You want the thing she is most protective of on a night where the vans will breed. I love it. But if she says no, you will accept no as if it were a sonnet.\u201d\n\nMaisie had been writing in corners of days since Brighton. She had verses that had grown legs overnight and choruses that had sulked under beds until tempted with biscuits. She had one, though, that had lived with her long enough to know her walk. It had been born in a night where the kettle had been a metronome and the sea had sent a message in a language you can only read from a window. It wasn\u2019t tidy. It wasn\u2019t designed for confetti. It had a line about a spoon drawer that would make the internet write \u201cquirky\u201d with the kind of affection that is a trap and a kiss. But it was true, and it wouldn\u2019t apologize for what it wasn\u2019t. She looked at Dan and then at Saj and then at the whiteboard gull and felt the peculiar courage that comes when your fear makes tea for your stubbornness and they decide to be allies. \u201cI have one,\u201d she said, threatening to smile and not. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have a bridge that begs. It has a middle that holds. It knows where it\u2019s going and where it refuses to go. I\u2019d like to try it.\u201d\n\nExecutive blinked like a man who had been surprised by an honest biscuit at a networking lunch. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to hear it,\u201d he said, which was reasonable and also ridiculous because hearing it in a room with bad carpet would have nothing to do with hearing it under lights. Lorna raised her pen an inch and put it down again without writing, because sometimes the recording is already in your head. Dan nodded as if he had been expecting this sentence since he met her. Saj made a small note that turned into three phone calls to the legal department because original songs come with paperwork like weather.\n\nThey took the song to a rehearsal room that didn\u2019t mind being christened and closed the door the way people close curtains when the house across the street suddenly takes an interest. She sang it through once like a confession. She sang it again like a plan. The third time she moved a word and the room moved with it. Dan played the piano with the caution of a man transporting a cake up a narrow staircase. Marta, who had replaced Albie with competence and a kindness that never announced itself, found a line inside the chord and brought it out like a thread. Nova listened with her face and then held the silence afterwards as if it had been given to her to mind. \u201cIt\u2019s yours,\u201d she said simply. \u201cAnd it\u2019s ours because you\u2019re letting it be. I hate you a little.\u201d\n\nSaj listened with her mouth for once and not just for her ears. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to keep it away from people who will try to put a hat on it that says \u2018ballad\u2019 in gold,\u201d she said, but her eyes had gone soft in a way Maisie had learned to translate as an internal yes. Executive demanded a hook and discovered that a hook can be a kindness if you don\u2019t pull too hard. Lorna suggested a staging with less furniture and more air. The lighting designer, a man with the soul of a moth and the posture of a poet, proposed \u201cjust enough to make it legible,\u201d and for once everyone agreed without needing to be the one who had the idea first.\n\nWhile they built a stage for a song that had been born in a kitchen, the outside world did the thing it always does when it smells an opportunity to write itself in. A storm blew in from nowhere with a name that should have belonged to a dowager aunt. It pinned itself to the coast and shook out its skirts over Eastbourne with enthusiasm. The pier sulked under a tarpaulin sky and the gulls lowered their standards and shouted at bins. The news did a segment about old towns and old weather and sent a camera to ask a man in a cap what he felt, and he told them he felt like putting a jumper on, which earned him a small fame and a plate of biscuits. Jai sent a video of himself standing in the doorway of the Driftwood, hair at an angle, mug in hand, declaring, \u201cWe are open. We are always open. The soup is so committed it has turned into a stew,\u201d and in the background the terrier appeared, took a large interest in a fallen napkin, and then left with purpose. Mrs. Pike texted to say that wind was undignified and that she\u2019d informed it personally.\n\nHer mother called from the hallway with the good reception and spoke in the clipped voice of a person trying not to be listened to by a house. \u201cYour song,\u201d she said, wasting no sentences. \u201cDo you do that thing I tell you not to do, where you smile too much to prove you\u2019re not afraid. Don\u2019t smile at the song if it doesn\u2019t ask you to. Smile at the people when it is done. The middle should look like you are reading a letter only you can see.\u201d She paused and in the pause Maisie could hear the quiet of their kitchen and the presence of a spoon drawer she could reach with her eyes shut. \u201cAlso, Maureen says the clouds have been badly brought up.\u201d\n\nLen wrote on a postcard from a shop that didn\u2019t sell postcards, \u201cIf the roof rattles, it means it\u2019s loyal to the house. It is announcing itself. Rattling is not failure. P.S. The dog found shelter in the chapel doorway like someone with a grievance and was offered a biscuit by a woman who believes in angels. He will no doubt behave worse tomorrow as a result.\u201d The card had a picture of a lighthouse and a price sticker that had been peeled off and replaced with a lower one, as if the sea had gone on sale. She put the postcard beside the recipe card under her pillow because talismans breed when you let them.\n\nThe night before the semi, the vans were already nesting outside the hotel like boxes with telemetry. The lobby had grown a layer of anticipation that made people raise their voices or lower them for effect. In a hallway painted the colour of conversations that go well, Nova pressed a sheet of paper into her hand, the cheap hotel stationery transformed by the act. \u201cIf they ask me about him again, I will say this,\u201d Nova said, breathing carefully, \u201cand then I will not say anything else. Will you read it to see if it is too much of a fence and not enough of a door.\u201d It wasn\u2019t. It was two sentences that said \u201cI\u2019m at work\u201d and \u201cNo,\u201d with such graciousness they felt like a hug you gave to your own boundaries. Maisie kissed her cheek and told her the fence had flowers and that was more than anyone could demand.\n\nThe morning decided to start without her and then remembered to invite her along. She woke into the kind of quiet that belongs to buildings before everyone remembers their lines. The air lay obedient. The city coughed into its sleeve. In the mirror she looked like a woman who had spent a month learning not to apologise. It suited her. Breakfast was a negotiation with toast and time. Dan appeared at her shoulder to murmur about breath and quietly engineer her into a better key for early talking. Saj slid into a chair and handed her a day the way people hand you a baby: This is happening, it is beautiful, don\u2019t drop it, and if you do, we will tell nobody.\n\nThe run-through went wrong in acceptable ways and right in one very important way: the song did, in rehearsal, the thing the song was supposed to do. It sat in the room like a chair and invited people to sit in it properly. The crew looked up from their phones more often than they were obliged to. A rigging man with hands like rope said to nobody in particular, \u201cMy mum will like that one,\u201d and then coughed to pretend he hadn\u2019t meant to speak. The stage manager with kind eyes and a count-in finger touched his earpiece and said, \u201cAgain from the chorus to make the cameras feel safe,\u201d and the cameras felt safer. Executive appeared, tapped the air like a conductor of emails, and said only, \u201cDon\u2019t change the second verse,\u201d which for him was love poetry.\n\nOutside, the storm arrived in a way that suggested it had read the call sheet. Rain came down with a professionalism you had to admire. Wind did not ask to be liked. On a different show, they would have moved a set piece and pretended to be the only thing that mattered. Here, they closed two doors and told the dog to stay inside if the hat blew off. Mrs. Pike set a mug down too hard and said, \u201cI am not interested in weather unless it peels paint, and I don\u2019t mean emotionally,\u201d and everyone took comfort from her refusal to be impressed by the sky.\n\nTwo hours before showtime, a boy with a microphone who had been a boy with a notebook the week before materialised in the corridor with the carpet that forgives mistakes. He stood in front of her with the confidence of someone certain that he was about to pluck a story like a ripe pear. \u201cHave you seen the statement,\u201d he said without greeting, holding his phone like a mirror to a life she did not recall signing for. \u201cHe\u2019s said he\u2019s in town. That he\u2019s here. That he wants to meet. That he\u2019s proud. That\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot today,\u201d she said, and the words had become a coat she could find with her eyes shut. \u201cNot here. Not during work. Not because you waited by a door.\u201d The boy blinked, young enough that perhaps someone at home would see this clip later and tell him to eat more, sleep more, ask fewer questions shaped like knives. Saj slid between them with the ease of a person who has moved between teeth and skin before, and the boy was invited to consider the weather elsewhere. Maisie stood still until her skin settled back on her bones, then walked to a room with a piano and a woman called Marta and a man called Dan and a piece of paper where the second verse would not change.\n\nBack home, the pier\u2019s boards sang a wet song to people who had chosen to walk anyway. Len had pulled his chair closer to the window because he preferred to watch weather rather than listen to it as rumour. The terrier lay in a complicated loaf by the heater, dreaming small running dreams. Her mother had put bowls under two leaks as if this were an arrangement she had made for visitors. Jai updated the chalkboard to read: SANDWICH OF THE DAY: PROPRIETY. COMES WITH PICKLE. Mrs. Pike told a customer that perhaps this was not the afternoon for iced coffee unless they were trying to prove a point to the gods. Eastbourne was being Eastbourne, and that had become, somehow, the anchor she carried with her to rooms with ceilings that changed colour on command.\n\nThey let her go third because there is a superstition about third that nobody will write down. Dressing felt less like costume and more like polite cooperation between fabric and shoulder. The dress did not try to be a metaphor. The shoes remembered not to lie. The earpiece behaved like a small bird that had been tamed without cruelty. In the wings, Nova bounced in place because bodies are clever, and Lorna put three fingers on the white of the doorframe, which might have been a habit and might have been a prayer. Saj checked a watch that was never for time but for weather, legal, and doors.\n\nThe room, when she stepped into it, did the thing it had to or everything else would have been pointless. It gave itself over to listening. She could feel the audience\u2019s weight the way you feel a cat decide to stay on your lap. Marta gave her that half-smile that says, We\u2019ll go now, and then they went. The first line came out like it had been waiting all week to be allowed to be itself. It had kitchen in it and caf\u00e9 in it and a boy with a skateboard in it and a woman with a bun who terrifies nonsense for sport. It had tea in it and tide, and the dog was somehow in the vowel without having to be thanked. The second line was a corridor she had built; she walked it with the familiarity you earn only by turning the same handle until it fits your palm. The chorus made a promise about here-ness that did not need to tell you where here was to be true.\n\nSomewhere in the second verse she felt the thing that happens when a song stops being a song and starts being an address. It is not applause. It is not a noise. It is a shift in a breathing animal. People lean in. People stop preparing a reaction. People take a word home to test it against their own cupboards. The bridge\u2014really a low arch, because that is how she builds them\u2014was the place where most people would have wanted a bit of shout. She lowered instead. She gave the room a soft thing and asked it not to drop it, and it didn\u2019t. In the last chorus, when someone less stubborn would have lifted a key to tell the room how to feel, she kept hers and let the melody do the lifting, and the relief in the audience was a heat you could have used for bread.\n\nWhen she finished, there was applause like rain on a tin roof: steady, enveloping, homely. The judges said their words, which this time were mostly words that meant \u201cwe saw you\u201d and \u201cwe will pretend we allowed this in case anyone asks us later whose idea it was.\u201d The host asked if this was about anyone and she said, looking at the audience and then at the camera as if it were a gull who had done its homework, \u201cIt\u2019s about a kitchen, and a town, and a day where you remember you promised something to yourself and keep it,\u201d and he blinked, and nodded, and moved on because a live show is a river with stones you can\u2019t sit on for too long.\n\nBackstage, Dan put his hands on her shoulders the way a builder checks a wall that isn\u2019t going anywhere and said, \u201cYou did the thing,\u201d which for a man who thinks adjectives are spare parts, not decorations, was an ovation. Marta grinned and put her guitar down gently as if it were a child who had finally fallen asleep. Nova cried for the precise amount of time that counts as hydration and then stopped as if on a timer. Lorna texted someone a single exclamation mark and then hid her phone under a folder as if the exclamation mark were confidential. Saj\u2019s eyes went glassy for a second, which means only that she had removed her armour to oil it.\n\nIn Eastbourne, under a sky that had run out of adjectives, Len took his hat off and put it back on without needing a reason. The terrier sat up when the chorus came and then lay down again when it realized that singing does not always lead to tarts. Mrs. Pike said, \u201cShe can come back and do the sugar,\u201d as if the matter had been under debate at a council level. Jai filmed the bell as it announced a woman with a wet scarf and edited text over it that read: When your friend makes the air behave, and then served two hot chocolates to teenagers shaking for reasons that had nothing to do with cold.\n\nIn the results, the floor remembered how to tilt. Names did the thing names do when they become heavy and end up on other people\u2019s tongues. There is a way a person fails to move under telling and a way a person dances without leaving the spot they\u2019re standing on, and she had learned both by now. Her name was called when it should have been, which is to say not so early it courted hate and not so late it looked like a miracle. Nova got through because the nation is not, after all, entirely opposed to trousers. A girl with a throat like a cathedral did not, and cried generously and still looked like a woman and not a wound. Someone made a speech about journeys that was not unbearable. People were human, and then they went to bed.\n\nAfter the show, the vans waited like patient sharks and Saj steered her into a door that led to a corridor that led to a lift that led to a hallway that did not have carpet that forgave everything, only most things. On the bed in her room lay an envelope with her name in that same careful pre-keyboard hand. It had domed a little with rain and then dried and kept its dignity. Inside was a letter, simple and small. Not five words. Not two. Enough to make a day reorder itself by an inch. It said, \u201cI won\u2019t come to your work. I am proud elsewhere. I will write, not turn up. I can be not a hole. I can be a coat on a peg. If you want.\u201d It had a phone number at the bottom and a name that had once been a word you could bruise your mouth on if you said it at the wrong time. She put the paper down because her hands had decided to stop. She made tea because kettles had been invented for this exact reason. She stood at the window and watched the city do late-night and early shift and resolve nothing at all.\n\nShe didn\u2019t answer. She wrote nothing. She put the letter under the recipe card like adults do when they are trying to be their most intelligent selves and leave decisions until after sleep. She texted her mother a sentence composed entirely of verbs without subject or object and received, three minutes later, a photograph of a spoon and a heart and a door. Len sent nothing, which was a kindness so precise it might have been a surgical instrument. She took pins out of her hair and laid them in a pattern that looked like a boat if you wanted it to and a hedgehog if you didn\u2019t. She washed the brave off and found the other kind underneath. She went to bed and let the room be a room, not a machine.\n\nIn the middle of the night the storm came back like a forgotten appointment and rattled the glass with professional gusto. Somewhere a siren found a road and performed purpose. In her dream she was on the pier in weather that couldn\u2019t decide and the fairy lights had elected a leader. She was holding a tart and the dog was giving her advice in a language made mostly of blinking. The sea came in and went out and in again because that is all it knows and all it needs to know. When she woke, there was the sound of the city taking a breath, and for a moment she did not think of cameras or papers or men with shirts that mean meetings. She thought of a spoon drawer and a note that had been waiting to be let out and the exact weight of a mug in her hand, and she said out loud, to the ceiling that had listened to hundreds of people being brave in their sleep, \u201cI am here,\u201d not loud, not for the record, just to remind her mouth how to say it.\n\nMorning arrived without asking and brought with it decisions shaped like cups. Lorna appeared with news about a theme that would not be obeyed. Dan arrived with a piano under his arm, figuratively, ready to argue with a key. Saj arrived with doors, as usual, with a look that said, Pack your coat and your no and your yes in that order. Nova arrived with a face that had made peace with trousers. Executive arrived with a new arrow for the whiteboard and the gull now had a scarf. The hotel had run out of the good jam. The city remembered how to be kind. The week had turned into a staircase and she put her foot on the next step, which is the only intelligent thing to do with stairs. The sea out there kept doing sea, and Eastbourne kept being a town with a bell and a lemon wall and a dog who had accidentally become national morale, and if the story had decided to be a story, well, she would keep the bones and lend the skin and make sure the song went where it needed to go.",

                              "content": "The gulls started before the sun, and the cutlery came after. Forks slipped into their compartments like slim silver fishes. Steam rose from the industrial dishwasher and kissed the peeling lemon paint on the kitchen walls of The Driftwood Caf\u00e9, an old Victorian tearoom tucked just off Eastbourne pier, where the pier planks creaked to their own rhythm and tourists came with their pastel trousers and their bright hopes for scones.\n\nMaisie Linton wiped her hands with a towel that had seen better summers and better tea spills, and hummed beneath the clatter. She always hummed when she was moving, when she was balancing three plates on one arm and there was an order for two bacon sandwiches, one without bacon. There was a space in her head that music knew how to fill, even in the narrow corridor between coffee machine and condensed milk tins.\n\nHer voice, when not muffled by steam and steel, could float, could surprise strangers into glancing up from their tea. Today, at eight-fifteen, she murmured the chorus of a song she pretended had no owner, just to see how the vowels tasted when they left. A little note perched on the rim of her mouth, like a gull on a cement post, and then flew.\n\n\u201cSave the opera for the Sunday lot,\u201d said Mrs. Pike, adjusting her glasses and peering through her own reflection in the pastry display. She kept her hair in a bun that had become an institution. \u201cWe\u2019ve barely any scones left as it is. They\u2019ll think there\u2019s some kind of performance and stay for lunch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m singing to the jam tarts,\u201d Maisie said. It came out vaguely Northern, the original tracing that years in Sussex hadn\u2019t ironed away. \u201cThey\u2019re drooping.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re raspberry,\u201d said Mrs. Pike, as if that answered anything. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget table nine, the lady with the terrible hat. She\u2019ll want a new fork; she always does.\u201d\n\n\u201cTable nine already got a fork,\u201d said Jai, sliding in with a tray like a ship into harbour. He wore an apron with a splash of coffee that had become part of the pattern. He had a manner of talking that kept a beat. \u201cAnd then she asked for something without gluten or guilt, and I said, \u2018We\u2019ve got air.\u2019\u201d\n\nMaisie laughed, and the steam slipped down her throat with her laughter. She reached for a cup, and then the bell above the caf\u00e9 door chimed its tinny, real-world version of bells that would, in a few months, seem like a different kind of stage cue.\n\nOutside, the sea did its reliable thing. The promenade carried dogs, joggers, elderly couples carrying memory like a careful parcel. The chalk cliffs sprawled to the west as if a giant had left a slice of cake out in weather. The pier extended its gaudy bones into the water, carrying arcades and teenagers and chipped paint and the occasional wedding photographer like a seagull with a camera.\n\n\u201cTable three needs you,\u201d Jai said. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones with questions. From London, obviously. They want to know if we do almond milk that\u2019s been\u2026 ethically serenaded.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf almond milk doesn\u2019t get at least a lullaby, it curdles,\u201d Maisie said. She gathered the menu, tucked it under her arm, and plastered on the smile that was both natural and armour. The Driftwood taught her that a smile could be both a spoon and a shield.\n\nThe couple at table three had matching fleeces and matching anxieties about dairy. The man pointed at the sea as if it had just arrived on the menu. \u201cIs that where the\u2026 what do you call it\u2026 Beachy Head is?\u201d he asked, one hand on his flat white, the other fluttering. \u201cI read about it on the internet. It looks very high. Are there steps?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are steps, of a sort,\u201d Maisie said, because it was easier to lie about cliffs than to talk about heights and what they mean to some people. \u201cBut you want to walk the long way if it\u2019s windy. The wind there has opinions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about the almond milk?\u201d the woman asked, soft voice, polite. \u201cI mean, if not almond, oat is fine, but not the sort that separates because then I think I\u2019m drinking something\u2026 else.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have oat that behaves like a gentleman,\u201d said Maisie. \u201cAnd coconut that\u2019s not too forward.\u201d\n\nThey laughed, and it felt good, like catching a ball you\u2019d thrown and expecting to miss. She walked back towards the machine and set the dials and thought of how she would have said it if she were standing with a microphone under lights that turned everything into a halo. The days when she came back from the bar with two pints and a lemon wedge, she\u2019d picture a panel, bright teeth and complicated hair and the kind of comments that came in millions. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just good caf\u00e9 banter, Maisie,\u201d someone would say. \u201cYou\u2019ve transformed oat milk.\u201d And she\u2019d grin and make something of it, because that was the plan. That was always the plan.\n\n\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Jai asked, bumping her hip gently. He knew when a cloud had drifted across her face. He knew the forecast.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d she lied. \u201cEverything. A little song I haven\u2019t finished. Or maybe I have.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should finish it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should finish all of them. And you should get out of here before Mrs. P gives you the tea towel award for most plates carried without breathing.\u201d\n\nMrs. Pike, polished the glass with a cloth that must have been older than Maisie. \u201cThe tea towel award is a serious honour,\u201d she said. \u201cNot like them programmes.\u201d She said \u201cprogrammes\u201d the way other people said \u201cplagues\u201d or \u201cdishes left overnight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Maisie, and then an elderly man at table nine tapped his teaspoon with a precise rhythm, as if imitating the second hand of a clock. \u201cWe deliver time too, now?\u201d she murmured.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d said Mrs. Pike, not unkindly, \u201care going to have to install a second pair of legs.\u201d\n\nThey danced around each other the way people who share space learn to, moving in a choreography that has nothing to do with music and everything to do with the dimensions of a room. It was a good morning; it would be a long day; it would be a good day because of that.\n\nAt eleven, as sun finally decided to test itself against the low cloud, a boy with a skateboard came through the door and almost brought a small terrier with him. The terrier was the kind that looks like it has opinions and has done since the first second it breathed air. Its paws made a clatter on the tiled floor, its lead a whip.\n\n\u201cNo dogs,\u201d Mrs. Pike began, on autopilot with a human voice.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just visiting the scones,\u201d the boy said, hair in his eyes, rolling the board up under one arm. \u201cWe\u2019re picking up, not staying.\u201d\n\nThe terrier looked at Maisie as if she were a person who had promised something and not delivered.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m visiting the scones too,\u201d she told it. \u201cDon\u2019t make me regret it.\u201d\n\nThe dog huffed. The dog had a huff that would be known in other chapters, though no one is granted that kind of foreknowledge and wouldn\u2019t know what to do with it if they were. The boy apologised in a way that wasn\u2019t yet learned, and the dog tugged, and the bell chimed tinny, and the sea kept its own time of breathing and breathing again.\n\nBy the time the lunch rush approached, she had served five teas, six coffees, an argument about egg mayonnaise and whose grandmother made it better, and a woman wearing a hat that could have been a small garden. She refilled water jug after water jug and decided she liked the new glasses that made all water look like a thing freshly invented.\n\nShe loved the days when she could see the horizon out of the corner of her eye. The days she couldn\u2019t \u2014 when the dream clanged inside her like a loose pipe and the reality of carry-and-smile, smile-and-carry, took up that space \u2014 at least had the consolation of coins in the tip jar, and the occasional compliment like small cash for the heart. \u201cYou\u2019ve a lovely voice,\u201d someone had once said as she sang absently with the radio while scrubbing the coffee nozzle. She\u2019d smiled then and said thank you, because you accept that praise like you accept rain; you don\u2019t let on that rain is the thing that keeps everything alive.\n\nAfter her shift, the streets smelt faintly of caramelised sugar and cigarettes, and the wind had found its courage. The sea was a particular mood of blue, the sort of blue that postcards don\u2019t dare to print in case people get disappointed. She walked home along the front, shoes in her hand. She liked to feel the cold on the edges of her toes. She liked to think that she walked at the same speed as the water. A seagull made a noise like it had a throat full of stones. Somewhere a child cried, and somewhere a child laughed, and it was the same child, because that\u2019s how a seafront works.\n\nHer flat lived above a charity shop that never closed when you needed it and always did when you wanted a lamp for a tenner and a book someone had written their name in in 1972. The stairs were narrow and the paint peeled in strips like handwriting. Home was two rooms and a window that faced a brick wall beautifully, and it was, miraculously, exactly what she needed most days. She dumped her bag on the sofa and opened the window and let in the salt. She pulled the curtains apart and let in a sky that had changed its mind again.\n\nShe had two voicemails from her mother, who had a way of leaving messages like the sea left messages, everything half-said, the most important word washed away. One was about a plumber and how they never came when they said they would. The other was about a television programme involving shepherds that her mother could not stop thinking about. She would phone back later and say, \u201cPlumbers, eh?\u201d and \u201cShepherds exist in the future as well as the past,\u201d and her mother would laugh and tell her to stop being clever. They\u2019d talk about whether to put peas in a pasta salad, whether to renew the television licence themselves or by magic, and the space where they didn\u2019t talk would be filled with a humming noise that could have been contentment or fear.\n\nThere was also a missed call from an unknown number. The voicemail that followed was only half-present, as if the person leaving it was both in a studio and backstage in their own life. \u201cHi, is that Maisie Linton?\u201d said the voice. It had a bright professionalism that made every greeting sound like an invitation. \u201cThis is just an initial check-in call from\u2014\u201d The name blurred under the hiss from her phone speaker. \u201c\u2014if you could give us a ring back at your convenience. Thank you.\u201d\n\nShe stood with her thumb on the redial for a moment and then decided to ignore it until she had warmed her hands on a mug. It was the sort of call she pretended could be for anyone, which is to say, the sort of call she hoped was for her, which is to say, something that tasted of adrenaline and had a sugar afterburn. She made tea because tea didn\u2019t demand she be a different person. Tea just said, \u201cHere\u2019s water that\u2019s been changed in a clever way; you can have milk if you like.\u201d She sat on the arm of the sofa and counted the sounds of the street like counting breaths.\n\nLater, when the steam had died in the mug and her fingers were still warm, she called back and walked into the kitchen with the mosaic floor she\u2019d tried to fix with nail varnish. The voice that answered was bright in a bright building.\n\n\u201cHello, Maisie. I\u2019m Lorna,\u201d said the voice that had once tried to leave a name and dropped it. \u201cSorry for the mystery. You applied to our programme, back in May. You came to the regional audition in Brighton.\u201d\n\nIt was true. Brighton had been different. Brighton had felt like standing on a slightly different version of the planet, one that had tilted her towards the place she thought she was going. She had sung for ninety seconds under lights that turned her face into uppercase. A woman with hair like a plan had smiled at her and said, \u201cYou surprised me,\u201d and she had walked out feeling taller and then the feeling had smoothed itself into something else.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was\u2026 I wanted to thank everyone, then, but I didn\u2019t know if that was weird. Felt a bit like bringing flowers to a dentist.\u201d\n\nLorna laughed. \u201cWe like flowers,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd money and ratings, you know how it is. Listen, is this a good time? I have some news to talk through.\u201d\n\nMaisie sat on the countertop and watched a spider in the corner of the ceiling trying to decide whether to continue its web or go, \u201cYou know what, I\u2019ll move.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a fine time,\u201d she said, heart doing the thing it did when a plane flew low and the cups shook in the caf\u00e9.\n\n\u201cYou know the process is long,\u201d Lorna said. \u201cThere are lots of people and cameras and, frankly, chaos. But sometimes things happen that change the shape of things. We\u2019ve had a\u2026 we\u2019ve had an opening.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn opening,\u201d Maisie repeated. She tried the words on like a jacket she thought wouldn\u2019t fit. \u201cLike a window?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a window,\u201d said Lorna. \u201cLike someone who was supposed to be in the live final cannot be, for reasons outside our control.\u201d Her voice slalomed around the sentences, careful not to name names or reasons. \u201cWe have a shortlist of wildcards. People who didn\u2019t make it through in the expected way, but whom the team liked very much. You might be on that list.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou might,\u201d Maisie said, because her brain couldn\u2019t wrap itself around would or will. \u201cAre you saying you\u2019re asking me if I could be asked?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaisie,\u201d Lorna said, with a laugh that had warmth under the brightness. \u201cHow do you feel about London next week? How do you feel about coming to the studios and letting us put a camera in your face while you sing?\u201d\n\nThe kitchen did a small tilt. The window looked at the brick wall like a friend suddenly made interesting. Her heart made shapes. She stood because sitting didn\u2019t feel like a posture that matched the world.\n\n\u201cI feel like\u2014\u201d she started and laughed because the sentence was too big. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ll need to ask Mrs. Pike for the week off. She will tell me the tea towel awards wait for no woman. But yes. Yes. I feel yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear,\u201d said Lorna. \u201cWe\u2019ll confirm everything by email tonight. You\u2019ll have to come in two days early for fittings, a bit of PR, some digital content shoots, you know the drill. We\u2019ll have accommodation for you and a chaperone, and we\u2019ll talk about song choices. Are you\u2026 are you comfortable with, you know, the public bit? The eyes?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been practising with the oat milk,\u201d she said, and then blushed because some part of her brain had decided to staple her caf\u00e9 life to her future. \u201cI\u2019m okay. I want this. I want this like you wouldn\u2019t believe. But I also\u2014\u201d She swallowed something like crying. \u201cI can do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Lorna. \u201cBelieve. Also, tell someone you love who will remind you to sleep. It\u2019s\u2026 there\u2019s a lot of noise.\u201d\n\nAfter she hung up, the kitchen shrank and grew and shrank again, the way rooms do when the thing you\u2019ve been waiting for knocks very politely. She pressed both hands flat to the counter and then picked up her phone and stared at it like it should have become a different object. The light from the window had found a new angle. Her breath had become a thing you could see.\n\nShe didn\u2019t call her mother first. She put on her shoes and her coat and tucked her scarf around her like she was defending herself against gales that hadn\u2019t arrived. She walked back out into the late afternoon and the wind knocked her gently into herself. The cloud had moved to let the sun through, and every brick on the street said light, light, I am not dull, put me in a story. She turned right instead of left. She went uphill.\n\nHer great-uncle Len lived in a bungalow painted the colour of an egg in a storybook. The garden was mostly lawn, except for the strip at the back where he had considered growing veg and then decided the council did enough vegetables for everyone. The gate stuck in wet weather and sang in dry. Today it scraped with a sound like a man clearing his throat before speaking.\n\nLen was at the back door making tea, because he was always, in any given moment, at the back door making tea or about to be. He had grown small with time in the way that went unnoticed until someone who had known him long enough said, \u201cWhen did you shrink? Put you in the wash?\u201d\n\n\u201cLittle Lint,\u201d he said when he saw her. He had called her that since the day she\u2019d come home from school with someone else\u2019s glitter on her jumper. \u201cAre you here to tell me you\u2019ve married a prince or that you\u2019ve fallen off the pier and into a boat?\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth,\u201d she said. \u201cUncle, I think I\u2019m going to be on the telly.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinally,\u201d he said. He always said finally when she told him something that stunned her. He had a way of believing things in advance and then going on with making tea. He handed her the mug. \u201cWhat telly are we talking about? The kind where you bake, or the one where you dance, or the one where people lie to each other in a tropical way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe singing one,\u201d she said. \u201cThe one where my voice does the bit and my face has to pose and there are judges who have eyebrows that cost more than my rent.\u201d\n\n\u201cEyebrows are an industry now,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw them in a supplement. They cost and they have their own opinions.\u201d He gestured to the table. They sat. His kitchen was small and ridiculously clean, a habit of living alone after his wife had passed when you either let the dishes make a nest or you tidied like someone was coming. \u201cAre you ready to be the voice that gets judged by people who\u2019ve never lifted a kettle?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve always been singing into a microphone that nobody could see.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen let somebody see it,\u201d said Len. \u201cLet them see it and do not give away your bones. You keep them. You can lend your skin to the dress-up, but keep the bones.\u201d\n\nShe laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re full of metaphors for an old postman.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like a parcel,\u201d he said. \u201cI spend half my life thinking about what\u2019s inside the paper and the other half about how to make sure it gets there. This is a parcel. Nobody else gets to say what\u2019s inside. Not even that nice lady on the TV with the hair like a cat fell asleep on her head.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even know who you\u2019re talking about,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI know enough about hair,\u201d he said. He took a sip and then breathed like tea was a small holiday. He looked at her, properly looked, which was a thing he did and that was a gift and sometimes felt like the opposite. \u201cYou\u2019re shaking,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 vibrating,\u201d she said. \u201cIs that allowed? I\u2019m happy. And terrified. Because if I go and I\u2019m\u2026 and I do something and I fall over my own tongue\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we will laugh,\u201d he said. \u201cWe who know you will laugh and we will say, there she is, our girl who can balance six plates and a hat and a casual remark and also a song, and she went and fell over her own tongue. And the sea will still go in and out. And you will come here and eat toast.\u201d\n\n\u201cToast solves everything,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cEverything worth solving,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, what do you need from me?\u201d\n\n\u201cAdvice,\u201d she said. \u201cOr a paper bag to breathe into. Or\u2026 maybe just to sit here and have you look at me like I am not about to fly apart.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not about to fly apart,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are about to expand. They are different. Expansion sounds dramatic, but it just means there\u2019s more of you in the same place.\u201d\n\nShe breathed properly then. Having him in the room did something to time. It made it less spiky. It made it lie down in a sunny patch and sigh. She sat with him for an hour, talking nonsense like it was a very important subject, and the thing inside her that wanted to run along the inside of her skin calmed to a jog.\n\nLater, when the sky had lowered itself to a gentler angle and the chill had started to find her wrists, she walked home and called her mother. Her mother did not pick up, because her mother rarely picked up first try; she was a woman who let phones ring out like superstitions and then phoned back at a time when you were in the bath. Maisie left a message. \u201cHi. It\u2019s me. Just\u2026 can you call me? I\u2019ve got news. It\u2019s the kind you laugh at and then cry about and then laugh again. Nothing bad. Okay. I love you. Call back. Or don\u2019t. But do.\u201d\n\nBy the time she ate something that had previously been pasta and sauce and was now a memory of both, the email from Lorna had arrived with all the energy of a person in an office whose desk was holding up a small part of the world. It had attachments. It had instructions that were instructions but also prayers that she would obey. It had a cheerful paragraph about what to pack and what not to bring and how hair could be done in twelve minutes if you didn't mind it looking like it had been asked a difficult question. It had a line about \u201cmedia training,\u201d which made her think of a horse master teaching a radio how to jump a fence.\n\nShe lay on her bed and stared at the ceiling, which had a stain in the corner shaped like a country that didn\u2019t exist, and let the idea sit. The idea walked around her room, curious, touching things, trying on her coat, looking out her window. She told it, \u201cI\u2019m ready when you are,\u201d and the idea smiled at her like a child about to run very fast uphill.\n\nThe next day at The Driftwood she told Mrs. Pike in the gap between a latte and a layer cake. \u201cI need next week off,\u201d she said, and watched as Mrs. Pike\u2019s bun tightened another quarter of an inch.\n\n\u201cAre you going to your cousin\u2019s thing?\u201d asked Mrs. Pike. \u201cThe one with the horse and the meadow and the terrible kebab van?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to London,\u201d Maisie said. She tried to say it in the same tone she\u2019d say, \u201cI\u2019m going to Brighton,\u201d which was to say, casually, like she did it daily. It came out in italics anyway. \u201cTo sing. On that programme.\u201d She did not say the name because she was still nervous that saying it might break it.\n\n\u201cWe will have to find someone else to insult the scones,\u201d said Mrs. Pike. She put the cloth down. She looked at Maisie like she was both fifteen and thrity. \u201cAll right. Go and be famous. But don\u2019t be rude about it. And come back. Because the plates will not carry themselves and Jai will start experimenting with cr\u00eapes again if we\u2019re left alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come back,\u201d Maisie said, with a conviction that surprised her, because she didn\u2019t know yet what coming back would be like, whether it would be with cameras at her shoulder, or just with the idea that followed her like a breeze long after you\u2019ve shut all the windows.\n\nJai hugged her like he had known this was in the post and had invited everybody to the surprise party in his head. \u201cI told you,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI told you the universe wants an encore. Bring me a souvenir eyebrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom whose face,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYour choice,\u201d he said. \u201cEthically sourced.\u201d\n\nBefore her shift ended, the boy with the skateboard had returned, minus the dog, as if he had had to separate his life into parts for everyone\u2019s safety. \u201cMy gran watches that show,\u201d he told Maisie after ordering a slice of Victoria sponge large enough to be a weight training routine. He told her because she had told him what she was going to do; she had felt so full she had to tell somebody and the boy had been at the counter and she had had a cake knife in her hand and things felt simple when you had a cake knife in your hand. \u201cShe says they ruin people on there, but she watches it anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey ruin cake,\u201d said Maisie, cutting another piece with the concentration of a surgeon. \u201cBut I\u2019m good at cake. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nHe nodded solemnly like a judge. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the face for it,\u201d he said. She waited for him to define it. He didn\u2019t. He just ate his cake with the logic of a teenager: all at once, like an apology he had decided to accept.\n\nBy Saturday, the town had begun to notice something different about the way she moved. People don\u2019t always name it, that shimmer, they just ask more questions about the weather as if weather could part its skies and explain. She met Lorna\u2019s requirements like ticking boxes on a sheet \u2014 she sent a scan of her passport, she tried on outfits whose seams thought about opinions, she practised songs in her bathroom where the sound bounced back onto her skin and made her feel more material. She told Len about the fittings and he muttered something about \u201cdon\u2019t let them put you in feathers unless you intend to fly,\u201d and then \u201cand don\u2019t let them put you in anything that says \u2018confidence\u2019 on the tag.\u201d\n\nTwo days before she was due in London, she went to the open mic at The Oriole, a pub behind the station that smelt of chip fat and history. She stood in the corner with a pint of ginger beer and felt like a person carrying fireworks under a big coat. She watched the man who always sang Oasis and the woman who did country songs like she had grown up in a field with a horse called Big Trouble. She sang second to last, because that was often the place where the room is either very ready or very tired. She sang a song she had written late on a Tuesday night while her upstairs neighbour had a fight with his kettle. She saw the words float out and sit on people\u2019s shoulders like birds. She didn\u2019t tell them about the telly because it felt like telling someone at the birth of a child how cheap the nappies were at a particular shop. It wasn\u2019t the time.\n\nAfter, the man who ran the thing \u2014 with hair that had chosen a side and then thought again halfway \u2014 said, \u201cThat was beautiful,\u201d and she said, \u201cThanks,\u201d and it felt like touching hands.\n\nWhen she walked home, the air tasted of cold metal, like licking a coin. She found herself thinking more about the rehearsals, about the stage managers with headsets who made the modern world work, about the way the floor of the stage would feel under her shoes. She let herself picture it. She let herself see the camera like an eye that wasn\u2019t unfriendly. She told herself she would not turn into a person who only thought about applause. She told herself that, and the gulls cried like they knew the punchline to a joke she hadn\u2019t heard yet.\n\nOn the morning she was due to take the train, she packed a small suitcase with clothes that could be rolled to save space and dreams that couldn\u2019t. She put in the blue dress because it promised to do her shoulders a kindness, and a pair of boots that made her feel taller because sometimes shoes lied in the right way. She packed cereal bars for lines, and tea bags because not all tea is created equal, and the battered notebook with the songs that had left and the ones that hadn\u2019t yet found their door. She texted Len: Leaving soon. Promise to send a picture of my exhibit at the Museum of Overwhelm. He replied with a thumbs-up and a sentence: Do not forget your bones.\n\nHer mother called as she was locking the door. \u201cYou\u2019re going to London,\u201d she said, voice all breath like she had run up stairs. \u201cTo sing. On the telly. Just like\u2014\u201d She couldn\u2019t say who, because who was a person who had left a long time ago with a guitar and never phoned. \u201cJust like some people do.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people do,\u201d said Maisie. \u201cI am some people. Are you proud? Or do you need to see my shoes first?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud,\u201d her mother said. \u201cBut not because of the telly. I\u2019m proud because you said you would. And you kept a promise to a girl who sang to the spoon drawer.\u201d\n\nMaisie cried, a little, like a kettle does when you don\u2019t give it enough water and it makes noises anyway. She told her mother she loved her. She promised to wave at the camera in a way only she would recognise. She promised to remember to eat. She promised to take pictures of buildings because her mother loved buildings, even the ugly ones, because they told the truth.\n\nAt the station, the wind got serious and tried to make everyone reconsider their hairstyle. The train came in belching air and possibility. She climbed aboard with her case bumping the step. She sat by the window and watched Eastbourne slip past like a photograph being pulled slowly away from her eyes. She saw the pier slide sideways and the sea become the kind of blue that hides under things. She watched the backs of houses, their private gardens, their laundry in defiance, their trampoline moons. She saw country slide in, flat and green and then suddenly rising, as if taking a deep breath.\n\nIn her lap, her hands lay very still. She watched other people on the train performing versions of themselves they reserved for travel. A man angled his newspaper the way a man does when he wants to be asked about the world. A girl with headphones practised expressions in the reflection, tiny adjustments as if she were ironing her face. A woman ate an apple like it was punching back.\n\nShe tried to imagine the studio. She tried to imagine the corridor that would lead to the stage, how it would smell \u2014 of metal and hairspray and nerves arranged into flowers \u2014 and how her feet would sound on it. She tried to imagine the judge table like an altar and the audience like a weather system. She didn\u2019t let herself reach the part where names rang out and a confetti cannon dreamt of confetti. She kept herself in the corridor. She walked down it in her head, slowly. She reached for the door. She opened it. She\u2014\n\nThe train lurched. A baby cried like a trumpet being stepped on. She laughed at herself and took a photo of the sky because it was there.\n\nWhen she reached London, a woman with a clipboard and a practised grin appeared at the end of the platform like she\u2019d grown there. \u201cMaisie,\u201d she said, in a voice that saw ten moves ahead. \u201cHi. I\u2019m Saj. I\u2019m taking you to the hotel where you\u2019ll meet the other wild\u2014 the other participants. Do you have everything? Any heavy emotional baggage? I can carry it for you but only to the car.\u201d\n\n\u201cI travel light,\u201d said Maisie, and Saj smiled with one corner of her mouth as if that was a good joke she had heard before and liked more every time.\n\nThe city opened like a book she had read in school and then again as an adult and found different words. The streets smelled of coffee and secrets. The pavements had their own personality and wanted you to know it. People moved the way schools of fish move when they\u2019re pretending to be individuals. She watched everything. She watched herself watching everything. She let herself be impressed and didn\u2019t apologize for it.\n\nThe hotel lobby had carpets designed to discourage people from thinking about stains, and chairs that looked like they had been made for people who were born to sit. There were flowers arranged with such intent that you imagined the person who had arranged them had apologised to each petal. Saj gave her a packet of papers and a badge with her name on it and a schedule that made her stomach both lift and settle. \u201cYou\u2019re on at nine tomorrow for wardrobe,\u201d Saj said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do a little interview today for social, like, your \u2018I\u2019m here!\u2019 moment. Can you say \u2018I\u2019m here\u2019 in a way that doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re being hunted?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can say it like I\u2019ve just found cake,\u201d said Maisie.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d said Saj. \u201cThat\u2019s the vibe.\u201d\n\nIn the elevator, there were mirrors on all four sides, and she saw herself multiplied, and she told each version of herself to be brave. When she reached her floor, she met a girl with hair the colour of a peach and earrings that could have moonlight caught in them. \u201cYou\u2019re Maisie,\u201d the girl said, and hugged her as if they were already remembering how to miss each other. \u201cI\u2019m Nova. Are you terrified? I\u2019m terrified. I\u2019m also pretending to be a person who is used to this. Look, I have a bag. It looks like a bag a used-to-this person would carry, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does,\u201d said Maisie. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of buying a hat that says \u2018calm\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake sure it fits,\u201d Nova said. \u201cSome hats lie.\u201d\n\nThe room was a room that could have been in any city, with a bed large enough to hold a small country\u2019s problems and three pillows that behaved. She opened the blinds and let the grey of the London sky in. The buildings opposite were rectangles of promise. She tried the bed and found it did that hotel bed thing where it pretends to be your mother while also being firm. She lay back and the ceiling had a soft way of being. She breathed once and then twice and then her phone buzzed with a message from Jai: Bring me a souvenir eyebrow and a story. She wrote back: Eyebrows grow on trees here.\n\nIn the afternoon, she sat on a chair in front of a camera and said, \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d and tried to say it like cake, like sunshine on the pier, like a guitar string finding the note. She did it three times because the first time had too much laugh in it and the second had not enough. She categorised herself: Person with Enough. She made a joke and the cameraman laughed with his mouth closed, and that was a good sound, because it was honest. She was asked a question about what this meant to her, and she thought of Len and his kettle and the look on his face when he held a letter with someone\u2019s name on it a thousand times and then had to put it through the slot. She said: \u201cIt means I get to try. It means I get to be the person who tries. I have always wanted to be the person who tries.\u201d\n\nBack in her room, it was half past six and the lights of the city were beginning to argue with the sunset. She thought of eating. She thought of going out and finding a takeaway that tasted like something new. She thought of staying in and ordering a tray that would arrive under a silver dome like in a story where people have staff. She looked at her bank account and decided treat now, worry later. She ordered hotel soup and something they called \u2018heritage bread\u2019 like it had been in someone\u2019s family for generations.\n\nWhen it came, she dipped the bread in the soup and pretended she was a person who always dipped bread in soup in hotels. The sounds of the corridor \u2014 a laugh, a wheelie suitcase, a hush of voices that had decided to be conspirators \u2014 were weirdly comforting. She set her alarm for too early and put Lorna\u2019s email on the bedside table like a talisman. She texted Len: In the big smoke, not yet smoked. He replied: Good girl. Take a photo of an ugly building and tell your mother it\u2019s handsome.\n\nBefore she slept, she stood by the window and watched a fox cross a road like it owned it, tail a flag. She thought about the corridor again, about the stage door, about the camera that wasn\u2019t a camera but an eye. She told herself to bring her bones. She told herself to sing to the oat milk and the jam tarts and the gulls, because that was where the voice came from. She told herself a story about a girl from Eastbourne with plates in her hands and a song in her chest and a tide that kept coming in and going out and in again, no matter who laughed when.\n\nShe slept. She dreamed of the pier dressed in fairy lights and a sky that could be held. The next morning she woke with her mouth dry and her heart doing a small tap dance. She put her hair up and her hope on and went downstairs to let the day begin.\n\nIn the hallway outside the room where wardrobe lived, there was a dog. A big one with a fur that had decided to be complicated, sitting next to a handler who looked at his watch like it was an enemy. The dog looked at Maisie with calm eyes and yawning calm breath. She reached out, because she was the sort of person who trusted dogs, and the handler said, \u201cHe\u2019s not working, you can,\u201d and she scratched behind the dog\u2019s ear and said, \u201cHi, mate,\u201d and the dog gave her a look that could have been a blessing in a different story, in the story where dogs are oracles and the ending can be guessed early.\n\nInside, there were rails of clothes in colours that knew how to behave on camera. There were people with tape measures around their necks like medals and pins sticking out of their lips, not dangerously, just stylishly. There were jokes about sequins and vows never to wear flesh-coloured anything. Nova was trying on something that glittered like a fish. \u201cToo much?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cJust enough,\u201d said a stylist with white hair that had decided to be cloud.\n\nWhen they held the blue dress up to Maisie, the room nodded. \u201cThis one knows your shoulder,\u201d said a woman whose bracelets made a noise like a quiet tambourine. \u201cIf it argues, let it. Arguments are interesting.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Maisie said. \u201cAs long as it doesn\u2019t hold a grudge.\u201d\n\nIt was all happening at a speed that at once exhilarated and unsteadied. Photos were taken of her standing still, and then moving, and then laughing, and then being asked to laugh again but less like a tickle and more like a new idea. Someone did her hair with the confidence of a person who had tamed storms. Someone did her face like they were painting a small faithful house with good windows. Someone laced her into something. Someone told her, \u201cDon\u2019t change,\u201d and someone else said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to change everything,\u201d and she thought, is this the same sentence or two different wrongs?\n\nIn the small break between glam and PR she found her corner and her notebook. She found her pen and a place to write. She wrote: Len says keep bones. Jai says eyebrows. Mum says spoon drawer. She wrote: corridor. She wrote: I am here. She wrote: I am here in a way that only I am. And she drew a gull that looked like a child had drawn it and the child had been in a hurry.\n\nSaj found her there and sat on the floor beside her like the floor was a friend. \u201cOkay?\u201d Saj said. \u201cToo much? Tell me if it\u2019s too much. I can take you to a small room where nothing happens for ten minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d said Maisie. \u201cI\u2019m a little\u2026 hummed. Like when the fridge sings.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that hum,\u201d said Saj. \u201cIt\u2019s the pre-noise. You\u2019ll be good. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you what you mean. You get to decide that bit.\u201d\n\nWhen rehearsal came, the stage was everything she had imagined and also something else. The lights were friendly until they weren\u2019t. The floor was black and glossy, like a river that had been trained to stay. The cameras swung with the languid authority of cranes. The studio seats rose in arcs that made you feel like you were at the bottom of a very pleasant bowl. It smelt faintly of steel and makeup and a coffee that had died valiantly for a good cause.\n\nShe stood on the mark that had her name in yellow chalk like a schoolyard, and she held the microphone in the way she had practised, with an ease that was both true and invented. She closed her eyes once to see if her voice needed darkness, and then she opened them because the eyes are part of the song. She heard the opening bar in the monitor in her ear and she began. She sang a line and the room listened or didn\u2019t. She sang another. She hit the note she had practised standing on her bathtub, toes gripping porcelain, and it came out like a bird that had been waiting to be let out and knew exactly where the open window was.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good one,\u201d said a voice from the dark. It might have been a stage manager or a lighting guy, someone whose job was to make miracles happen and whose compliment was the currency of a very efficient country. She smiled at the dark. She sang again. Her hands knew not to shake. Her mouth knew which name to say. She finished and the room did a small polite clap that felt important because it had come from people who knew the work of making small revolutions happen every day.\n\nAfter, backstage, where corridors pretended to be endless, she found Nova and a boy called Albie who was nineteen and had a voice like a boat. They had the look of children who had eaten too much sugar. They spoke in a language that was mostly adjectives and hope. They made promises to each other about the future as if the future had ears.\n\nIn the tiny gap of her own company, she sat with her phone in her hand, her case open, her shoes making a decision. She thought of Eastbourne and of the Driftwood and of the pier wearing its best, and of Len and his toast, and of her mother watching a building on television. She thought of a terrier with a leader. She thought of a boy with a skateboard and his gran\u2019s complicated love for programmes that ruin people and rescue them. She laughed at nothing in particular.\n\nThis was the beginning. This was the middle of the beginning. Some of the story would happen on television and some of it would happen in rooms where nobody was watching. The sea would continue to do sea. Plates would still need carrying. Voices would still need to be whispered into the ears of bad weather. And somewhere, in the space between that humming stage and her hand on a tea mug, a girl would understand something about what it is to want, and what it is to take, and what it is to go on wanting even when the thing you have taken becomes a different animal in your hands.\n\nShe went to sleep that night in a hotel bed in a city that had more light than it needed and less kindness than it deserved, and she told herself again, quietly, so as not to wake the girls in the walls and the dreams on the furniture: I am here. I am here. I am here.",

                              "content": "Morning in the hotel was a different species of morning, as if somebody had drawn it with a ruler. The light seeped around blackout curtains like a polite burglar, the air conditioning continued its polite argument with itself, and the city outside coughed discreetly into its sleeve. Maisie woke as if surfacing from water that had remembered to be warm, her body briefly surprised to find itself in a square of expensive quiet. For a few seconds she lay still and listened to the sort of silence you could only buy by the night, a silence made of elevators that hushed themselves and carpets that forgave shoes. She checked her phone with one eye and found three messages from Jai timestamped too late and too early: a photo of the Driftwood\u2019s new chalkboard special (\u201cSuspicious Quiche \u2014 Market Price\u201d), a close-up of a customer\u2019s hat that could have sheltered rabbits, and a voice note that was mostly steam hiss and then, \u201cBreak a leg but in the metaphor way, and if they try to make you sing in a cloud of dry ice, tell them you\u2019ve got damp lungs.\u201d\n\nHer reply was a heart and a promise she could not word that early. She sat up and found that her throat had done the hotel thing where it felt as if she\u2019d been speaking in her sleep to a roomful of dignitaries. She drank water straight from the glass bottle because it felt like the kind of day where you could pretend you were in a film about competence. She did the ridiculous vocal warm-ups in the shower, the ones that turned her vowels into bubbles and made her laugh at herself, and the laugh worked better than the scales. When she wrapped herself in the robe, it embraced her like a hug from an aunt who liked a bargain and always knew when your nails needed cutting.\n\nThe breakfast room was an international peace treaty of bacon and fruit. People in good trousers made decisions about pastry as if choosing cabinets. A small child negotiated toast with cunning usually reserved for lawyers. Maisie and Nova found a table by a window that framed a slice of building without context and compared plates as though they were comparing courage. Nova had the kind of appetite that went with fear and youth, both generous, and she speared a sausage with relief. \u201cI dreamed I was on stage and my mouth made a noise like a bicycle pump,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I woke up and it turned out to be the air con.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter than dreaming you\u2019re in bed and waking up on stage,\u201d Maisie said, buttering toast carefully, because buttering toast carefully made other things feel possible. \u201cIf my mouth makes a bicycle pump noise, I\u2019ll do it in key.\u201d\n\nNova lowered her voice and leaned in as if the yogurt might overhear. \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll make me tell the \u2018my dad left\u2019 story again? They keep asking where the music came from like it arrived on a lorry with a missing taillight.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey asked me yesterday if I\u2019d \u2018overcome adversity\u2019,\u201d Maisie said. She had rolled the phrase around her mouth afterwards and it had lost consonants until it became a pudding. \u201cI said yes. Once a man ordered a flat white and when I brought it he said he\u2019d meant a cappuccino but with less personality.\u201d\n\nNova snorted into her tea and then coughed like she had stolen laughter from the wrong pocket. \u201cSaj told me to make a list of what I won\u2019t say. I put \u2018my eyebrows are not the story\u2019 and \u2018my ex-boyfriend is not a suitable antagonist\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Maisie. \u201cAdd \u2018Eastbourne is not a sleepy town; it naps with intention\u2019.\u201d\n\nThey ate and pretended to read the schedule for the day without flinching. Nine, wardrobe adjustments. Ten, a thing called \u201cdigital pick-ups\u201d that sounded like a dating app for cameras. Eleven-thirty, vocal with the coach whose picture on the wall showed teeth that belonged to someone who flossed in public. Lunch slotted in like an apology. Two, a block of time called \u201cmedia\u201d that sat on the page like a black shoe. Four, dress rehearsal. Six, a pause before everything. The day had a shape that accepted you and then pressed you into its corners.\n\nLorna found them in the lobby wearing a lanyard and an air of being equal to it all. She looked like she had been poured into her morning with neatness. \u201cThey\u2019re cutting the backstory VT to two minutes,\u201d she said, as if discussing travel shampoo. \u201cThey want to do a line about the caf\u00e9 and the sea and how you sing between steam and jam. But we need a phrase from you, something that\u2019s\u2026 you know\u2026 na\u00efvely poetic but also true.\u201d\n\n\u201cNa\u00efvely poetic,\u201d Nova repeated, rolling the words around like mints. \u201cI can do knowingly mundane.\u201d\n\n\u201cI made friends with oat milk,\u201d Maisie said, because the phrase rose easily to the surface. \u201cIt listens.\u201d\n\nLorna blinked and then smiled, the face of a woman who would write down anything that glinted and take it to the editor like treasure. \u201cWe\u2019ll use something like that,\u201d she said. \u201cNot exactly that, because we have a thing with brands and sentient beverages.\u201d\n\nThey were whisked along corridors that had learned how to keep secrets by design. The wardrobe room looked different in daylight, less like a dream and more like a busy market where the currency was buckle and seam. The blue dress was there like a promise kept. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a tiny tweak,\u201d said the woman with tambourine bracelets, her fingers already coaxing a line of fabric. \u201cThe camera liked you but wanted more you at the shoulder. The trick is always you but more.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be more forehead,\u201d Maisie said, but she had learned to choose her battles, and shoulders were not the hill on which she would die. As the pins kissed and retreated, she watched herself in a mirror that softened everything like a grandmother. She had never seen herself look this much like a person somebody else might mistake for someone important. It was both thrilling and fraudulent, a twin emotion that set up camp under her sternum and erected a nice little flag.\n\nThe vocal room smelled like lemon and ambition. The coach introduced himself as Dan, shook hands with a sincerity that was almost American, and looked at her throat the way a mechanic looks at a carburettor. \u201cYou\u2019re holding a bit high in the chest,\u201d he said, tapping a sound out of her with a piano that had national service. \u201cLet the breath drop. Let yourself be heavier in the floor. Sing through your teeth like you mean it but you\u2019re not telling anyone you mean it.\u201d\n\nShe did what he said and her voice changed shape under her own ribs, surprising itself. It grew up slightly in front of her, like a child showing you it had learned to tie a knot. Dan nodded once and then again, more slowly. \u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t apologise with your vibrato. It\u2019s very British to apologise with your vibrato. London will forgive you. America will not. You\u2019re not in America.\u201d\n\nShe laughed and he smiled in that careful way coaches do when they sprinkle humour between metronomes. Nova went next and built a note so clean it might have been a decision. They clapped each other because that\u2019s what you do when you\u2019ve been given the same mountain and different shoes.\n\nBy late morning she had answered the same question about her \u201cjourney\u201d four times with four different verbs. She had learned which doors led to rooms that had coffee and which led to rooms that had important people saying the word \u201cbrand\u201d like it was an endangered bird. She had nodded carefully at a producer who said, \u201cCan we avoid mentioning your father unless we absolutely need to,\u201d and she had replied, \u201cWe absolutely do not need to.\u201d The producer had glanced at her with relief and then tapped a note into a phone as if saving a life.\n\nBack in the hotel corridor, her mother called at last, the call bouncing off the international carpet pattern like a pebble across a pond. \u201cI\u2019ve made sandwiches,\u201d her mother said, triumphant, as though announcing a medical breakthrough. \u201cFor the train. Ham and something that looks like cheese but isn\u2019t. I\u2019m on the twelve-oh-six with Maureen because she says she will not watch you alone in the house in case she goes blind with nerves.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were coming,\u201d Maisie said, feeling the floor shift in a lovely way that made you adjust your weight for joy. \u201cI can get you tickets, I think. Saj can do\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need tickets,\u201d her mother said, already three moves ahead on a board Maisie didn\u2019t see. \u201cWe\u2019re going to watch at Maureen\u2019s sister\u2019s because she has the big telly and the kind of wine that makes you honest. We tried to get audience places but they said something about lotteries and liability. We\u2019ll shout at the right times. We\u2019ve practised. Also, I found your old recorder in the drawer with the birthday candles. It still has a tune in it. This means something.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means nothing,\u201d Maisie said, delighted. \u201cIt means the drawer is haunted. I\u2019ll send you a picture when I\u2019m in the thing. Don\u2019t wear the jumper that is allergic to cameras.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has opinions,\u201d her mother said. \u201cI will silence it with a necklace. I love you. Don\u2019t let them do your hair like that woman on the breakfast show who looks as if she\u2019s been plugged in.\u201d\n\nAfter lunch (soup that tried to be both comforting and chic and achieved one of those), Saj found her leaning against a wall that probably had a stronger agent than she did. \u201cTwo small items,\u201d Saj said, in the calm tone of a person who holds back weather for a living. \u201cOne: the head of hair has asked if we can add a hairpiece for the second verse because the lights love movement. Two: social is posting your teaser at three, and there will be comments. Do you want them on your phone or do you want me to take the bullet and send you only the kind ones and the funny ones about shoes?\u201d\n\n\u201cSend me the ones about shoes,\u201d said Maisie. \u201cAnd one cruel one so I know the world hasn\u2019t ended.\u201d\n\nSaj nodded gravely, as though crudity could be apportioned like salt. \u201cAlso,\u201d she added, in a quieter voice that was almost a gift, \u201cif anyone uses the phrase \u2018girl-next-door\u2019 in a way that makes your teeth itch, you can send them to me and I will talk to them about doors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Maisie said. \u201cAnd no hairpiece that moves like animal. If it rustles, it\u2019s out.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d Saj said, with a little salute that could have been irony or genuine affection. \u201cAnd Sidenote Len called the office and left a message. He said, \u2018Tell the girl that the post is still delivered in the rain.\u2019 I don\u2019t know what it means, but he sounded like a person who meant it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means I can\u2019t cancel the day just because my socks get wet,\u201d Maisie said, feeling the words settle into place like weights that made her steadier. \u201cAnd it means he likes to be mysterious on purpose.\u201d\n\nThe digital pick-up involved a white wall, a swingy light, and a camera that leaned in like a friend who wants to hear who you\u2019re talking about. \u201cSay your name and where you\u2019re from,\u201d the director said, friendly, patient, a man who had taught many people to walk through a sentence. \u201cThen give us three words that describe you. Try not to say \u2018fun\u2019, because fun people never say fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Maisie Linton,\u201d she said, hearing her own voice and greeting it as if it were a relative who had aged well. \u201cFrom Eastbourne, which is not a seaside clich\u00e9 although it does have better clich\u00e9s than anywhere else. Three words. I am\u2026 curious. I am\u2026 late sometimes. I am\u2026 here.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d the director said, the way you say good to a plant that has just surprised you. \u201cNow say something you\u2019d say to your younger self. Not the one from this morning. The one with the recorder in the drawer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say drink water and keep the songs even when they look badly dressed,\u201d she said, and then felt unaccountably like crying, which was unhelpful, so she smiled instead and asked if that had been usable. The cameraman made the mouth laugh again, and that was enough to hold her together.\n\nDress rehearsal had the texture of reality with all the edges taped. They put her in the dress and the shoes and the little invisibility devices that made the sound disappear into her head and come back like a perfect circle. They gave her a mark on the floor and a cue she could feel in her belly. They asked her to walk as if she had been born on a mark. The lights warmed up like engines. The audience seats were dappled with production assistants, bored and brilliant, clapping in the right places because they had read the map. She ran the song once fully and then again half-hearted because the third time is for people who can afford to get tired early.\n\nOn the second run, her in-ear monitor did the thing the universe sometimes does where it whispers, Something will go wrong and that something will be you. The sound cut and she found herself hearing the room instead of herself, a slapback of reality. She stopped where she would rather not stop and lifted her hand slightly in the international sign for, \u201cI am not being a diva but please help me or I will cry.\u201d A figure emerged from the wings with a coil of cable and a headtorch and the ease of a god of small rescues. He adjusted something in a way that had been invented for this precise crisis, and he gave her a nod as if to say, There, the world again. She sang the bar she had missed, and the note curled out obedient and true. Somewhere in the darkness, someone clapped once because they understood the relief contained in a correct return.\n\nBy late afternoon the building had clicked into live-show mode. Tempers in far corners rose and fell like souffl\u00e9s. Trolleys rolled laden with impossible flowers. A coffee went cold upright on a sheet of call times as if it had been mid-sentence. She felt a slow, steady mechanism crank within herself, a sense of gears aligning with the coming hour. She found the little quiet room Saj had promised and sat there, the silence a warm coat. On the wall was a poster from an old series, a girl with perfect hair and teeth arranged like white weather. Someone had scrawled across it, in a hand that was both defiant and grieving: She cried and then she sang better. Maisie looked at it and had a feeling that was not envy and not warning, just a flicker of recognition that people are always two things at once.\n\nHer phone buzzed. It was Len, of course, having remembered the twenty-first-century version of shouting across a road. He sent a photograph of toast. He had arranged it on a plate with the seriousness of a saint. Under it he wrote: Above acceptable standard. You?\n\nShe took a picture of her shoes obediently aligned beneath the chair and wrote: Believing my own ankles. He replied: Good ankles run in the family. Also, if a camera tries to steal your soul, keep a copy.\n\nAt six, the host breezed into the corridor with the kind of presence that made corridors remember why they exist. He said things to people as if he had invented cheer and was now licensing it. He said to her, \u201cYou\u2019re our little caf\u00e9 singer, aren\u2019t you,\u201d and she resisted the urge to correct the possessive and simply smiled and said, \u201cI am someone\u2019s little caf\u00e9 singer,\u201d because that was true and left him nowhere to stand but where he already was. He waggled his eyebrows at her in a way that suggested they were self-employed and then moved on, trailed by a woman carrying cards and a man wearing the expression of a person who had once been surprised and swore never again.\n\nSaj appeared with a garment bag and a gaze that could focus satellites. \u201cTwo minutes for a breath,\u201d she said. \u201cThen we place you. Your song is third. They changed the running order because the second act\u2019s backdrop is allergic to light cues, which is not a thing I knew backdrops could be. If you need to pee, do it now. If you need to cry, do it now. If you need to write a will, it can wait.\u201d\n\nMaisie checked her face in a compact handed to her by a woman who could have sculpted a better face out of meringue and air. She smoothed a thing that didn\u2019t need smoothing. She put her hand to her chest and felt the small metronome of her heart, faithful and unruly. \u201cI am going to sing to the jam tarts,\u201d she told Saj, half under her breath. \u201cEven if the jam tarts are in other houses.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Saj said. \u201cBetter ratings.\u201d\n\nThey moved as a group, like a dance where the steps were equipment and the music was warnings. She stood in the wings and felt the heat of the place, simultaneous and particular, the way a kitchen has heat you can only describe by being in it. The first act sang and a wall of sound rose and fell, and she allowed herself one peek at the audience without seeing them. The second act stood behind the flat with a look that said, If I run now, I can catch a bus out of town, and then didn\u2019t run, because solidarity is contagious.\n\nHer turn came with the inevitability of a train arriving exactly when it says it will. A floor manager with kind eyes and a count-in finger pointed at her. \u201cThirty seconds,\u201d he said, the number clean on his hand. \u201cBreathe. Two deep. Remember your first line. Then forget it and mean it.\u201d His headset crackled in a language that only headsets speak, and he listened to the invisible world and nodded as if it had promised to be good. \u201cTen,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got this, love.\u201d\n\nMaisie stepped onto the mark. The lights cooled and then warmed. The set shifted its weight and settled. The mic was a small planet in her hand. Somewhere far away and very close, a camera blinked. She thought of the Driftwood and the lemon paint peeling in long careful strips. She thought of Mrs. Pike and her institutional bun. She thought of Jai and his eyebrows as a souvenir. She thought of Len\u2019s toast and her mother\u2019s sandwich cut diagonally because that did something to fate. She thought of the dog in the hallway and of a boy with a skateboard. She thought of the corridor in her mind that she had walked down a thousand times without seeing the door open.\n\nThe music found her in the ear and the floor found her feet and the breath settled the way a bird settles on a wire and trusts the wind. She opened her mouth and let the note out, not like a plea, not like a trick, but like a statement that had been waiting politely to speak. The room shifted slightly towards her. The camera came closer or she went to meet it; in that moment it was impossible to say. She sang the second line and brought her shoulders into it without apology. She remembered, mid-phrase, to open the vowels like windows, the way Dan had shown her, and the sound stepped out onto a balcony and waved.\n\nHalfway through, when the lyric asked her to confess to something she did not owe anyone, she chose instead to tell a simpler truth. It sat inside the line and made it feel different, less like a borrowed dress and more like a jacket she had owned for years. The bridge came and she walked across it without looking down. At the top note, the one she had prised open in her bathroom with steam and stubbornness, the place where women have dropped or soared in front of millions, she did not think of millions. She thought of a little girl singing to a spoon drawer. She thought of oat milk and gulls. The note rose and it did not wobble and it did not apologise. It rang, clean and blue, like a bit of the sea you can hold.\n\nWhen it was done, there was the sound that is noise and also information. Hands and breath and the small thunder of feet finding a floor they liked. She did not let herself look at the judges because she did not owe her face to their faces. Instead she let her eyes find a place at the back of the room where perhaps there was a person who had chosen to come alone and would be glad of being addressed without being named. She smiled, not because someone would freeze it on a feed and measure it, but because it was a reflex like the tide. She managed not to cry until she was three steps off the mark and safely in a pocket of unlit air that smelt faintly of spray and hairspray and relief.\n\nBackstage hugged her in a way she could use. Nova grabbed her and said things with her whole mouth that did not land as language and did not need to. Albie thumped her back like a brother on a pier avoiding feeling too much. Dan the vocal coach passed and made a small circle with thumb and forefinger, a sign language of competence. Lorna breathed out like a person whose plates had all spun and not fallen. Saj pressed a bottle of water into her hand the way you hand someone a verdict, and the water understood.\n\nThe judges spoke in the room out there, the room with the expensive noises. Someone said a word that had too much sugar around it. Someone else said a sentence that took away with one hand and returned it with the other, like a pickpocket doing magic. It would be clipped later and placed on the internet and captioned in fonts she could not control. She listened for a second and then stopped, not ungrateful, just self-preserving. She heard her name pronounced correctly and decided that was a good omen.\n\nAlone for a sliver of time you could slip a coin through, she went to the quiet room and sat on the chair as if sitting were something you could fail. Her phone was a small, lit planet on the table. There were messages from numbers that had fathers attached and from unknowns with hearts in their names. There was a message from her mother that read simply: I see you. There was one from Len with no text, just a video of the sea hitting the Eastbourne beach with its reliable enthusiasm. There was one from Jai: The dog approves. He had attached a photo of a terrier watching a television with an intent so serious it was comic. She laughed properly then, dipped her head and laughed, and let the laugh be the thing that unlocked the rest.\n\nThe night reassembled itself around her like furniture after guests. There were more acts and more lights and a segment in which a former champion came back to sing about the high cost of triumph and dental. There were results that trailed their suspense like wedding trains. There was a moment on the stage with a cluster of other people where the host called her name and a camera found her again, and she thought, of course you did, and she stood in the shower of a sound she did not own and nodded and remembered to reassure the people at home that she was indeed still grateful. There was a hand squeeze from Nova that said, We will get through or we will go for chips. There was the strange etiquette around not looking too victorious next to someone who needed a chair.\n\nLater, in the post-something room where questions were asked to fill content like pastry shells, a young man with a microphone that had a foam windscreen the colour of a cartoon asked her, bright as a whistle, \u201cSo, what does this mean for the caf\u00e9? Are you moving on?\u201d and she said, without being noble and without being foolish, \u201cIt means the caf\u00e9 gets more stories to put between the teapots. It means I can carry plates and a song at the same time for as long as that makes sense,\u201d and he blinked and nodded and said, \u201cLove that,\u201d as if he had invented nuance.\n\nBack in her room, alone at last with her face and her feet and her hands that smelt vaguely of roses and microphones, she stood in the window and watched the city keeping its late promises. She took the pins out of her hair one by one, feeling each tiny release as if she were returning parts of herself to herself. She washed the paint from her skin and saw her own colour come back like tide turning on a familiar beach. In the mirror, unvarnished and unscripted, she was a person who had done a thing and would do another, not a legend, not a cautionary tale, and not yet a footnote.\n\nBefore bed she wrote a few lines in her book. She wrote: I let the note out and it did not bite me. She wrote: Saj says doors are not people. She wrote: The dog approved. She drew a toast and under it a gull and under that a small rectangle that could be a stage or a table. She closed the book and it clicked shut like a good thought. She crawled under the hotel duvet which had the exact weight of reassurance and she let sleep come, not because she was done, but because morning would be a mouth and she would need to fill it.\n\nWhen she woke at three, as people do when their bodies have stored messengers, she felt the quiet hum of the building like a ship in friendly weather. She looked at the ceiling and thought of the stain in her flat shaped like a country that didn\u2019t exist. She thought of the pier in fairy lights that had visited her in a past dream. She let herself imagine the next song, the one she hadn\u2019t dared offer, the one that lived in two keys like a house with two front doors. She heard in her head the way the band would find it, the way the cameras would learn to nod. She let the thought be large enough to scare her. Then she rolled over and trusted the dark.\n\nIn the morning, she would wake and the city would draw its lines and write her in again where needed. She would answer questions and ignore others. She would drink tea that tried very hard and might succeed. She would text pictures of ugly buildings to her mother and call them handsome. She would look after her bones and let the dresses borrow her, and she would sing to anyone who had once been a spoon drawer. The programme would go on wanting. The sea would go on doing. She would go on being a person who tried. And somewhere, in the Driftwood, a terrier would scratch at the door as if demanding a fork.",

It ironed the clouds flat and sent a band of pale yellow across the buildings with all the ceremony of a first cup of tea. The city coughed properly this time, none of last night\u2019s discreet hand-over-mouth, and somewhere a van reversed with the persistence of a metronome. Maisie woke with her tongue feeling as if it had been speaking foreign the whole night and her shoulders aware of having been loaned to a dress. For a moment she didn\u2019t know which ceiling belonged to her, and then the air-conditioning made its civilised wheeze and the carpet under her bare foot told her she was still inside a place that believed in breakfast buffets and emergency sewing kits in tiny boxes.\n\nHer phone did the thing of being both a door and a crowd. The red dots had multiplied as if they had been breeding when she slept. Saj had sent a packet of links with the label: shoes, only. There were indeed shoes\u2014her shoes, or at least shoes that had been attached to her for the evening\u2014assessed by strangers who spoke in hyperbole and suede. There was a clip of the high note annotated with a hundred musical emojis and three people in Texas arguing about vowel placement. There was a photo of her halfway through a laugh, hair compromising with light, captioned by the show as \u201cOur caf\u00e9 songbird,\u201d and she felt the possessive again and let it pass through her like weather. The cruel one Saj had promised was not so cruel as it had intended to be; it said something about \u201cplain,\u201d which made her laugh out loud in the hotel room because if last night had been plain then the world\u2019s adjectives needed retraining.\n\nThere were private messages that opened like parcels in a corridor you didn\u2019t know you were walking down. Some were from girls in towns with seafronts and none, with photos of mugs and windows, saying, \u201cI sing to the kettle too,\u201d and \u201cMy Nan says you remind her of someone who wasn\u2019t afraid of church.\u201d One was from the boy with the skateboard: Gran cried at the good bit and then pretended she was allergic to light. He had attached a blurry photograph of the terrier with its head tilted, as if listening critically. There was a message from Albie consisting only of a boat emoji and three exclamation marks. There were two from unknown numbers that had managed to fetch themselves into her inbox with the authority of bills; one was a production schedule, the other a request for a photograph of her as a child \u201cwith an instrument or a significant prop, perhaps a whisk,\u201d which made her sit on the edge of the bed and hold her ribs and laugh until it became a cough.\n\nBy ten she had been shepherded across two floors, into a room that smelt of hair and decisions, and into a chair with a back like a hug. The woman with the tambourine bracelets fluffed and pinned and spoke to her in a language made of compliments that were also instructions. \u201cWe\u2019re going to let you be you,\u201d she said, while pressing a hot instrument against Maisie\u2019s head. \u201cBut a little more you, for the television. The camera loves a curve and hates a shadow that looks like regret.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe camera and I will sign a truce,\u201d Maisie said, and caught her own eyes in the mirror and saw that they had not slept as much as they thought. She put her palm to the glass as if greeting a fish in a tank. The fish smiled back, which was her, which was ridiculous.\n\nDan the vocal coach appeared like a man who had just tuned a piano with his mind. He made her yawn in specific, useful ways and hum at the walls. \u201cDon\u2019t gargle coffee,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lie. Gargle water and swallow courage. Also, breathe into your kidneys.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll send them a card,\u201d she said, and he shook his head and smiled and went away to tell someone else not to apologise in their soft palate.\n\nMidway through a bite of toast stolen from a tray going somewhere more important, Saj slid into the spare chair with the authority of a person who could sit in motion. \u201cWe\u2019ve had an idea,\u201d she said mildly, the way people say \u201cwe\u2019ve had a power cut\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019re having a baby,\u201d as if both were inevitable and had asked nicely. \u201cExecutive would like to do a return-to-roots package if you progress. Film at the caf\u00e9, a walk on the pier, maybe the chalk cliffs if we can convince Health and Safety that you won\u2019t fling yourself at existence. Mrs. Pike on camera would break the internet in half. We\u2019ll ask consent like decent people. You could be home the day after tomorrow for twenty-four hours. Are you breathing? I need you to breathe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d said Maisie, who had held her breath in the middle of Saj\u2019s sentence as if underwater. \u201cMrs. Pike will say \u2018programmes\u2019 like it\u2019s a diagnosis and threaten the hair and do it anyway. Jai will wallpaper the door with puns. Len will pretend to hide. My mother will insist the house is too small to be filmed and then redecorate by moving a cushion. Yes. Yes, I\u2019ll do it. On two conditions.\u201d\n\nSaj\u2019s eyebrow went up, professional curiosity with good posture. \u201cName them,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make Eastbourne look like it\u2019s been asleep since 1983,\u201d said Maisie. \u201cAnd don\u2019t ask me to cry on the pier because the tide has opinions.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeal,\u201d Saj said immediately. \u201cWe can\u2019t control the editor\u2019s love of slow-motion gulls, but we can threaten them with a cactus. I\u2019ll call Mrs. Pike and use my best voice.\u201d\n\nThey put a hold on a train while the day unfolded like a map. There was a radio interview in a room that smelt of old laughter and sweets, where a man with a beard asked her about \u201cthe caf\u00e9 life\u201d and whether a cappuccino ever becomes a cappuccino, and she answered with grace and a joke about foam that got her invited back if she had time and liked chairs. There was a photoshoot in front of a backdrop that changed colours like a mood ring where the photographer said, \u201cGive me the woman who has just remembered a better word,\u201d and she found that woman in her jaw. There was a meeting with a producer whose wedding ring and smile both looked expensive, who took deep, meaningful sips of water and wanted to know if she would be comfortable talking about \u201cthe paternal absence that shaped your resilience,\u201d and Maisie said, evenly, with the exact amount of you\u2019re-not-fooling-me in her mouth, \u201cNo. I am comfortable talking about jam tarts and unpaid electric bills and a man on the promenade who uses his dog for moral support. The rest is bones and I am keeping them.\u201d\n\nThe producer paused, recalibrated mid-sip, and smiled as if he had always intended to be decent. \u201cFair enough,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s talk jam tarts.\u201d Later, in a lift, Saj patted her arm once, a punctuation mark. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cNot everyone knows the names of their lines. You do. That helps.\u201d\n\nNova and Albie found her at a table with a salad that looked like it had auditioned for a role in a better salad. Nova had the wide-eyed look of a person who had been crying in a bathroom not because anything had happened but because all of it had. \u201cThey asked me if I could sing the one about forgiveness,\u201d she said, stabbing a slice of cucumber as if it had done infrastructure damage. \u201cI said yes and then they said, \u2018But can you sing it about forgiveness.\u2019 I don\u2019t know what that means. My mouth is a mouth, not a moral.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means they want you to be a lighthouse and a revenue stream,\u201d Albie said, who had the soft accent of boats and had been raised by older women to carry heavy things without complaint. \u201cSing your song. They\u2019ll call it forgiveness if it trends.\u201d\n\nMaisie watched Nova\u2019s face make and unmake shapes. She reached across the table and put her hand on hers, a very small bridge. \u201cWe can go and buy chips after rehearsal,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a place the runners whisper about that salts like a religion. We will eat too much of a thing that\u2019s bad for us and talk about nothing in particular as if it\u2019s an art. You can tell me everything you won\u2019t tell that camera with the eyes. Deal?\u201d\n\nNova nodded, a swallow as decisive as a promise. \u201cDeal,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, your shoes have become content. You\u2019re viral from the ankle down.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy ankles have always wanted a social life,\u201d Maisie said, and that got them a laugh each, which was enough to move them all into the next hour.\n\nThe train the following day was at an hour that barely qualified as morning unless you were a postman or very committed to bread. Saj had arranged everything with a swish and a spreadsheet. Mrs. Pike had consented in the tone of a monarch allowing a circus into the park, and Jai had replied to a polite email from a junior researcher with, \u201cWe keep our jam tarts in their natural environment and may not be able to guarantee their performance; bring treats.\u201d Len had left a message on Maisie\u2019s phone at midnight that just said, \u201cI will be on the path between the brambles and the decision. Don\u2019t be late,\u201d which she took to mean, I will put the kettle on and I expect to be hugged.\n\nThe sky over Sussex that morning had committed to pale, the kind that makes birds visible long after they think they\u2019re private. Maisie watched the fields turn into houses and the houses into fields the way people turn into people who have to be somewhere. When she got off at Eastbourne, the platform smelled like its old self: salt and newspaper and the after-breath of coffee. A small camera crew formed a loose constellation around her, careful to make her look like a person walking instead of a person filmed walking. Saj wore a high-visibility jacket that insisted she was a human being with a plan, and a man with a boom pole held his windscreen like a friendly hedgehog. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep it small,\u201d Saj murmured. \u201cWe are wallpaper. If the wallpaper speaks, it will apologise.\u201d\n\nThe Driftwood had made an effort by pretending it had made no effort at all. The lemon paint still peeled in satisfying narratives. The bell still announced arrivals with the humility of an instrument somebody\u2019s uncle had repaired. Mrs. Pike had put on a cardigan with buttons like warnings, and her bun had achieved a height previously reserved for religious buildings. Jai had laid out the cakes in an arrangement that would have pleased an architect, and there was a handwritten sign on the counter that read: We are temporarily famous. Tips help with that.\n\nThe first customer on camera was the lady with the terrible hat, which had become more terrible as if it had been breeding with itself. She tapped a teaspoon against a saucer with intent to produce a specific note and said to Maisie in front of the lens, \u201cIf you become unbearable, I will still need jam,\u201d which was both threat and benediction. The boy with the skateboard arrived exactly when the assistant director wanted \u201ca bit of normal,\u201d his hair a decision he had made in the dark. He had left the terrier at home, he said, because he didn\u2019t want it \u201cto do a poo on telly,\u201d and then whispered that Gran had made a banner out of a pillowcase that said \u201cOur Girl,\u201d which she would display only when no one was there.\n\nMrs. Pike refused to say the word \u201cprogramme.\u201d She said, \u201ctelevision nonsense\u201d and \u201cthat business with the lights,\u201d and then finally, after a generous piece to camera about the virtue of a scone left alone to be itself, she said, \u201cour Maisie has a mouth that does good work,\u201d and took off her glasses and polished them in a way that silenced three strong men. Jai did a piece to camera in which he used the word \u201cumami\u201d incorrectly but with such glee that nobody cared. The crew filmed Maisie rinsing cups and singing under her breath, which she swore she didn\u2019t pose for and which she absolutely did. They filmed the pier from three angles and made the gulls look complicit. One gull landed on the railing behind her and performed head movements that were pure critique; the camera loved it. The assistant director whispered, \u201cCan we get the gull\u2019s agent,\u201d and Saj wrote something on her clipboard that probably said no birds in union.\n\nThey asked for a walk on the promenade \u201cjust towards the horizon and back,\u201d which was the kind of instruction people who do not live by water give. Halfway along, a man who had known Maisie vaguely since she was ten stopped them with the confidence of people who have paid rates in the town all their lives. \u201cSaw you on the telly,\u201d he said, marshalling his eyebrows into formation. \u201cVery good. Your old man will be proud if he\u2019s watching, wherever he is.\u201d\n\nThe sentence slid in under her coat and sat there with cold hands. She smiled, automatically, the way she smiled when a customer at the Driftwood asked for something the kitchen didn\u2019t make and used the words \u201cas a favour.\u201d She said, \u201cThank you,\u201d and meant the kindness and not the hook in it, and walked on with the camera faithfully walking on behind. Past the arcades, past the couple arguing about whether a donut was an experience. Saj drifted back to her like a tide being careful. \u201cYou all right,\u201d she said, not a question, which was a gift.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Maisie said, because there were people with batteries attached to them and a schedule and the town had put on its best brave face. \u201cIt\u2019s a sentence that will arrive a lot, I think. I may need to learn to nod without bruising.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will hire you a nod,\u201d Saj said, and Maisie laughed, quietly, and let the laugh make a crack where the cold could leave.\n\nThey went to see Len because no home story is complete without a man who can boil water into wisdom. He opened his back door the way a magician produces a rabbit, entirely unsurprised, and pulled Maisie into a hug which had spines under its softness. He addressed the camera politely as if it were a council officer and then ignored it completely. \u201cSit,\u201d he said to Maisie. \u201cEat this biscuit; it is older than respectable but it will hold together under pressure.\u201d He made tea, and the kettle sang to fill the spaces where none of them wanted to talk. The producer asked him if he was proud and he said, \u201cYes,\u201d as if the word had been waiting in his mouth, and then, \u201cBut I was proud when she learned to cross roads properly and when she put her name on her lunch at school as if it were a declaration. Television is a different kind of proud. It comes in a box.\u201d\n\nThe terrier appeared after all, in the third hour, in the arms of the skateboard boy who had been sent home by his gran with orders to stop hovering. It wriggled free like a thought and trotted straight into the caf\u00e9 as if on a mission from itself. A jam tart had escaped to the very edge of a plate; it was a tart that had never learned prudence. The dog placed both front paws on the counter with the authority of a small officer and took the tart delicately in its teeth like evidence. The room inhaled as one organism. The camera, being a predator by training, swung and caught the theft in a shot that would later be slowed down and set to a tiny string section. Mrs. Pike said, \u201cOh, for the love of\u2014\u201d not finishing with a word that would have needed bleeping, and Maisie, out of instinct and kindness, went around the counter to kneel, by which time the terrier had eaten the jam and offered her the even more delicate crust, as though sharing. She took the crust and the room exhaled. The assistant director murmured, \u201cWe have our ending,\u201d and even Saj allowed herself a grin that showed a tooth.\n\nBy late afternoon they had their pier walk, their caf\u00e9 hum, their Linton family offshoot being Linton in a kitchen, their gull, their dog, their hat. They had enough ordinary to make extraordinary look honest. Saj did the thank-yous like a professional bouquet. The crew folded themselves away and promised not to tidy Eastbourne up in the edit, which was the best they could give. Jai pinned a five-pound note to a corkboard and wrote Dog Tax in tidy capital letters. Mrs. Pike declared that she would never again consent to being filmed by people who did not understand the intimate relationship between sponge and custard. Len walked Maisie to the gate and held her for a moment longer than time. \u201cDid the sentence hurt,\u201d he said, in the voice he used for things you might not have words for yet.\n\n\u201cA little,\u201d she said. \u201cNot as much as it will if I keep standing still. And I stood still, Uncle. But it\u2019s\u2014I don\u2019t want to be made out of a hole. I prefer cake.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not a hole,\u201d he said, with the absolution of the elderly. \u201cYou are a road with scenic views and occasional roadworks. The hole is other people\u2019s problem. Also, that dog will be famous by teatime. Beware being upstaged by mammals.\u201d\n\nShe laughed and kissed his head and told him she would return him to the television in a fortnight, weather and scheduling permitting. Her mother had elected not to be filmed on account of having a relationship with cameras that could be described as suspicious, but she had sent Maisie off with a Tupperware of sausage rolls and a lecture about sleep that echoed in her bones. On the platform, as the train rolled in and Eastbourne arranged itself back into the shape of her childhood view, she saw the boy with the skateboard and the terrier on the far side, both of them looking as if they had done something significant by accident. She waved, and the boy nodded in that solemn way he had adopted for occasions, and the dog blinked and, without breaking eye contact, licked its nose, which felt like the highest form of acknowledgement.\n\nOn the ride back, the countryside performed its smooth vanishing act and the train exhaled at every small station like an old animal. Maisie ate a sausage roll with reverence and read the messages accumulating in clusters. The show account had posted the caf\u00e9 clip with the dog and a caption that did not entirely embarrass her. People had found it with the enthusiasm of creatures who know how to find soft things and hold them up to the light. \u201cIf she sings like she looks at that dog,\u201d wrote one, which made her grin at the window. There was also a message from a name that looked like it had taken a long time to write. It contained five words: I heard you. Proud anyway. She stared at it until the words went blurry with the reflection of the sky, and then she took a photo of a field because there was nothing else sensible to do. She did not reply. She put the phone face-down like you do with a fork when you\u2019re finished being polite.\n\nBack in the hotel the floors were in a different mood. You learn the personality of a building by how it greets you at different times of day. Tonight it was quietly thrilled, as if it had secrets in the wardrobes. In the corridor Nova was sitting cross-legged outside her room with her back against the door, hair in a knot that looked like it had decided to be contrary. She patted the carpet beside her and Maisie sat, because floors are still floors even when they are expensive. They swapped stories of the day in the way women do when the rest of the world has been speaking in content. Maisie told her about the sentence on the promenade and Nova told her about a reporter who had asked if she was \u201cready to be a role model,\u201d as if role model were a coat you could try on and then accept out of duty.\n\n\u201cI told him I\u2019m ready to be a person who buys crisps and reheats pasta twice,\u201d Nova said. \u201cHe looked like I\u2019d failed a test.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou passed the only one that counts,\u201d Maisie said. \u201cWant a sausage roll? It travels well.\u201d\n\nThey ate sitting on carpet that was currently a universe. Albie came out of his room in socks and a T-shirt that said \u201cBe Nice or Leave\u201d and sat down without asking because that was the kind of friendship they had built in three days\u2014that of people who pretended they were not making a raft in the middle of a river. He showed them a video of a woman in Blackpool singing his song into a hairbrush and wept with laughter until the housekeeper peeped around the corner to ask if they needed more towels for their emotional support.\n\nOut of habit, when the noise thinned, Maisie reached for the notebook that had been everywhere with her since the day she could afford notebooks that didn\u2019t fall apart at the spine. She flicked to a page where she had written in a train hand: corridor, bones, jam. She thought about next week with the clarity of a person who has run a bath and intends to get into it this time. The producers had sent a list of suggested songs, none of which were wrong, all of which had the shine of a song that had won something for somebody else. She wanted to sing something that did not ask permission. Something that tasted of wind and undercoat paint and clear, sharp mornings. Dan had told her to think about a song with a sliding melody that found her vowels and made them work for it. She thought of one she had sung once in an empty church for the sake of acoustics and stubbornness. It had a chorus that didn\u2019t pretend to be anything it wasn\u2019t. She wrote the title in the margin and underlined it twice. She would have to fight for it. She was more ready for a fight than she had been before the dog and the tart and the sentence.\n\nIn the small hours she woke to the sound the city makes when it turns over and goes back to sleep. She lay and listened as if the walls had something to confess. She thought of the message with its five words and put them in her mouth like pebbles. Proud anyway, proud anyway. It was a kind sentence wearing a shirt that didn\u2019t fit. She hadn\u2019t asked for it and she wouldn\u2019t build a house out of it. But she let it sit in the chair for a minute with a blanket around it before she showed it to the door. Then, because there was work to do and cheeks to wash and muscles to coax, she closed her eyes and walked the corridor in her head again. She put her hand to the door and she pushed and this time it swung easily. The room was the room. The light was the light. The floor was the friendly river. And she, who had sung to spoons and dogs and the invisible woman at the back of the room, stepped forward and breathed and saved nothing for later.",

The room had one wall of polite glass and one wall of a whiteboard where somebody had drawn arrows from her name to words like \u201cauthentic,\u201d \u201cseaside,\u201d and \u201crelatable.\u201d Someone had also drawn a gull and given it sunglasses. Executive wore a shirt the colour of meetings and spoke about \u201cowning the niche\u201d as though a seaside town were a cloud storage account. Lorna sat with a pen poised in the air as if it were a small bridge she might put down. Saj leaned against the radiator that didn\u2019t work but performed radiator as a role, and watched Maisie as if she were a person she could trust to name a fire.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thinking power ballad this week,\u201d said Executive, undeterred by the presence of the radiator. \u201cKeep the arc upward. Uplift. Give us the note again, but higher, longer, sustained. We\u2019ll put you in something white that looks like sincerity under lights. Maybe wind. The audience loves wind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love wind,\u201d Maisie said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s outside doing what it does. I was thinking something smaller. Slower. A song that knows how to talk, not shout. We could do it spare. A guitar or a piano and a space big enough for the words to sit down. It has a slide in it I can stand on. It\u2019s not\u2014\u201d She searched for the word that wasn\u2019t old-fashioned or timid or niche. \u201cIt\u2019s not loud. But it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nExecutive smiled in the way of men who understand trains and not tides. \u201cWe can make truth loud,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s our job. We help people hear it.\u201d\n\nDan, who had arrived with a coffee and the expression of a person who knows bad posture when he sees it, cleared his throat. \u201cHer instrument loves room,\u201d he said, in a tone that disguised advocacy as technical advice. \u201cIf we put too many notes around her, we\u2019ll steal the air. Let her carry quiet. It will read.\u201d\n\nSaj said nothing and then said something. \u201cThe clip from the caf\u00e9 is at a million,\u201d she offered, as if dropping a biscuit into a teacup to see whether it would sink. \u201cPeople are saying they can hear the kettle. They like that. If we make her into weather, they\u2019ll say we changed the forecast.\u201d She directed a look at Executive like a post-it, brightly-coloured and square. \u201cWe can save wind for later. The warehouse has not run out.\u201d\n\nThere was a small silence. The whiteboard gull stared into a future it could not control. Executive tapped the pen he had borrowed from nobody. Lorna wrote down something that could have been \u201cspare arrangement?\u201d or \u201cspare eyebrow?\u201d or \u201cremember to breathe,\u201d her shorthand as ambiguous as air. Finally, Executive gave a little shrug you could translate as a green light if you were trained in optimism. \u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cSpare. But not dull. And we need a moment for camera. The camera is part of the choir.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll teach it harmony,\u201d Maisie said. \u201cGive me the song and the room, and I\u2019ll bring it to the lens.\u201d\n\nOut in the corridor, with its carpet that had opinions about suitcases, Saj fell into step with her. \u201cYou held the line,\u201d she murmured. \u201cGood. The line exists because you drew it. We will find you a guitarist who listens.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a guitarist in mind,\u201d said Maisie, thinking of Albie\u2019s hands on a fretboard like someone deciding how to love something properly. \u201cIf we\u2019re allowed to keep it in-house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are allowed,\u201d Saj said. \u201cThe rules are permeable when applied with confidence.\u201d\n\nWord threaded down the day, through the hall like a piece of gossip that had decided to be helpful. Albie came to the rehearsal room with a guitar that had the dings of a useful life and said, \u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d in a voice that asked both about chords and friendship. Nova sat cross-legged on a case and watched with her chin in her hand, her eyes doing the quick moving of somebody who was building a memory to keep. Dan stood by the piano like a person at a bar he trusted.\n\nThey played the first verse as if the floor might break. Albie found the slide she had promised and rode it down into gentle. The melody unfurled with the weight of nothing more than honesty. There was a moment where the line hit a vowel that asked her to remember a kitchen that smelt of steam and lemon paint, and she widened it the way she had been taught and the air became something she could see. Dan nodded without showing his teeth and scratched a note on his page. Nova let out a small, involuntary \u201coh,\u201d which told Maisie she had been brave enough and only that.\n\n\u201cAgain,\u201d Dan said, soft enough that it wasn\u2019t an order. \u201cThis time let the breath sit behind the words like a chair you\u2019re willing to use.\u201d\n\nThey ran it until the furniture of it knew her. They tried the bridge with a different shape under it and then returned to the shape her body chose first. They argued about nothing in particular that meant everything\u2014capo or not, rubato here or there, whether a heartbeat should be left in or taken out. It became not a plan but a place. It became a corridor she could walk down and find a door open.\n\nThe clip from Eastbourne aired that afternoon in the hour before a news bulletin full of necessary sorrow and football. The dog was a star in three time zones by tea. Mrs. Pike became a meme with the caption \u201cmouth that does good work,\u201d which, to her credit, she didn\u2019t mind once she understood that people were laughing with her and not at her. The boy with the skateboard texted her a photograph of his gran pointing at the telly with a wooden spoon like it had offended her and then hugging it. The caf\u00e9 was busier for an hour than it had any right to be at four-fifteen, and Jai sent a video of himself doing a mock-press conference at the counter, answering questions from customers with a colander as a microphone. \u201cNo, we will not be selling dog-eaten pastries,\u201d he said, perfectly pompous. \u201cYes, you may take a photograph of the jam. No, I cannot reveal our tart supplier; she wears a cape and comes in at night.\u201d\n\nLen refused to be filmed live because \u201cI don\u2019t do television that talks back,\u201d but he allowed Maureen to record him on a phone raising a cup of tea in salute. The video had his slipper in it and half his face, which only increased its charm. Her mother sent a message that said, in its entirety, He stole a tart and spared the crust, which I think is a metaphor for men, followed by three kisses and a shopping list of things she thought might be necessary for Fame, including a lint roller and humility.\n\nBy evening there were three vans outside the hotel and a man with a camera who was not attached to a call sheet. He had the stance of a person who trusted himself to be disliked. When she came through the revolving door with Nova and their day packaged neatly under their arms, he took four photographs with the speed of someone trying to win a prize at a fair. He called her name as if they had been introduced at a party ten years ago. \u201cMaisie,\u201d he said, almost kindly. \u201cGive us a smile. Give us a little chin. Give us an Eastbourne.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t stop long enough to decide whether to be clever. She gave him the chin she was born with and the smile she had rented from a kind day and the straight back that came from needing to walk through noise. Saj materialised between lenses and said, \u201cNo questions tonight, lads,\u201d in a voice that had a velvet rope built into it. Nova walked butterfly-gentle but kept going. In the lift, breath caught up with them, ripped its tights, swore, and then pretended it hadn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cDo I have to learn how to walk from the car to the door?\u201d Nova asked, pulling her hair into a shape that did not declare defeat.\n\n\u201cYou already know,\u201d Maisie said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same walk as to the stage. You pretend the ground is your friend and you don\u2019t say sorry to anyone you don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cTeach a class,\u201d Nova said, and then, because they could, they took each other\u2019s hands for the sixty seconds to the seventh floor.\n\nThe week did what weeks do when they are full: it grew a second spine and held everything up anyway. Rehearsals were disciplined and kind until they weren\u2019t, because someone hadn\u2019t slept or a screen had failed to do the right picture at the right time or an intern put the wrong name on the wrong sandwich. People said, \u201cAll good,\u201d and meant \u201cmostly good.\u201d People said, \u201cWe move,\u201d and meant \u201cwe refuse to drown.\u201d Dan was a metronome and a priest and a man with a spare cough sweet in his pocket. Lorna had an argument in the hall with a person whose job could be summarised as \u201cNo,\u201d and walked away with a small smile you could not help but admire. Saj kept the doors opening at the right moment and the wrong ones locked and the phones pointed away from hearts. Executive came and peered and nodded and left, as if he were an eagle pretending to be a pigeon.\n\nThe day of the show she woke brittle and then softened under tea. She did the ridiculous mouth shapes while drying her hair, and her reflection in the hotel mirror did them back with a straight face, which felt like solidarity. In the breakfast room, a man from another world told her he loved her dress without looking up from his eggs; she said thank you, then remembered she wasn\u2019t wearing it and laughed into her toast. Nova had slept badly and wore it like eyeliner. Albie was already at the piano on his floor when she wandered through and he said, without pausing his hands, \u201cI\u2019ve got you,\u201d which she believed the way you believe gravity when you step.\n\nThey dressed her in the blue again because the dress had decided to be a friend. Hair moved but did not rustle. Someone glued a wire behind her ear in a way that felt like trust. Saj handed her a note card with three questions she might be asked and three answers she would not give, because some things did not belong to twenty cameras and the internet\u2019s morning-after. One was about her father. One was about whether she had a boyfriend. One was about whether she had a plan for losing, as if losing were a place with a map and a gift shop. She slid the card into her shoe like a talisman and took two stupidly deep breaths that made Dan nod approvingly from across the room like a man who had been consulted and found his advice obeyed.\n\nIn the lineup, in the wings, there was a smell of hairspray and nerves fried in butter. The girl with the peach hair, Nova\u2019s new friend called Tansy, whispered that she had forgotten how to count and hoped counting wasn\u2019t involved. A stagehand with tattoos of ships on his forearms called them \u201csweethearts\u201d without being demeaning and set them on their marks with the gentleness of a person putting bread in an oven. The host glanced at his cue cards as if they were written in a language he had learned for money. The lights rose into their useful joy. Someone in the audience already had a sign with Maisie\u2019s name on it that glinted like a lake. She wanted, just for a charcoal second, to be the person in the audience holding a sign for someone else.\n\nAlbie looked at her across the black river of the stage like a man about to swim with his guitar as a buoy. He did a small nod that looked like a spell. The red light went from friendly to important. The music started, not louder than conversation, but intimate, like a cousin. The room came close, the way rooms do when they are listening properly. She sang the first line as if there were only one person to hear it and that person wasn\u2019t her. The words sat where she\u2019d put chairs for them. The second line had a drop like a small hill on a bicycle. She didn\u2019t wobble. She didn\u2019t apologise. She did as Dan had asked and let her breath be behind the word like a chair she trusted. In the bridge, something shifted that had nothing to do with microphones and everything to do with permission. She gave herself more and the room came closer and then stepped back, respecting the distance, a dance taught without teaching.\n\nThe camera was there when she glanced for it, not a predator, not a friend, but an eye doing its job. She gave it a moment not choreographed\u2014a tiny smile at a place where a smile didn\u2019t belong, because she\u2019d heard a woman in the front row sigh for a reason she didn\u2019t know. Albie\u2019s fingers did the slide that had felt like a question and now was an answer. The last note did not need to be as high as last week\u2019s or as long. It needed to be clean and true and unafraid, and so it was. The quiet afterwards was the kind of quiet that proves noise exists.\n\nThey didn\u2019t whoop like she was a feat of engineering. They breathed out like they had been held and then released. Somewhere a man coughed because he had forgotten how not to. Backstage, Nova hugged her with eyes wet that she refused to acknowledge as wet. Dan did the circle again and added a second circle, which was not a thing he did often. Saj pressed her hand once as if transferring a spell. Lorna\u2019s grin had real teeth in it. Executive gave a thumbs-up you could tell he had practised in a mirror and did not mind being seen practising.\n\nThe judges did their dance. One talked about control as if it were a horse. Another talked about authenticity and nearly meant it. The third corrected a word that did not need correcting and then said something about Eastbourne that was almost accurate. She thanked them with the grace of a person taking a compliment and returning the wrapping. The host tried to make her say the phrase \u201cjourney\u201d and she gave him \u201cweek\u201d instead, which he pocketed like a coin and moved on to a person with a bigger hairpiece.\n\nIn the chaos just before results, Saj pulled her into the little quiet room that had already learned her shape. \u201cTwo things,\u201d she said, leaning on the door so softly it didn\u2019t know it was being asked to help. \u201cOne: they love the dog. That\u2019s helpful news. Two: a reporter is asking about the message. The \u2018I heard you. Proud anyway\u2019 one. They mention a name you have not used. I have said, \u2018No comment.\u2019 We can say, \u2018Private.\u2019 We can say, \u2018Irrelevant.\u2019 Or we can say nothing, which is a verb. The choice is yours and also mine, but I ask you first.\u201d\n\nThe room tipped a little, the way a boat does when a wave passes under it and the captain doesn\u2019t flinch. Maisie felt the five words in the pocket of her cardigan though they were not physically there. She thought of the man on the promenade offering her a hole to climb into, of the cake and the crust and the dog who shared what he didn\u2019t need. She thought of her mother and the recorder and the drawer that hummed. She thought of thirteen and of seventeen and of twenty-two, and of how being watched was not the same as being seen.\n\n\u201cSay nothing,\u201d she said, with a steadiness that surprised the part of her that had wanted to be generous to strangers. \u201cSay I\u2019m at work. Say the kettle\u2019s on.\u201d\n\n\u201cDone,\u201d Saj said, touching her shoulder in a way that felt like a small medal pinned inside a jacket. \u201cAnd if anyone asks you, you can say, \u2018Not today.\u2019 It\u2019s a full sentence.\u201d\n\nThe results came like the sea\u2014inevitable, dramatic if you stood in the wrong place, and wet with other people\u2019s feelings. The lights remembered how to frighten. Names were called as if they were doors opening and closing in a corridor where you had left coats. Albie went through and looked back once as if this were a game of statues and not career. Nova\u2019s name was late enough that Maisie\u2019s stomach found religion. When it came, Nova made the soft-gasp noise of a person who has postponed a cry and it leaked anyway. Maisie\u2019s name arrived in the middle, not early enough to be arrogance, not late enough to be a story. They stood together because that was what they\u2019d decided to do, two girls from nationally different corners of the same need, and when a boy with too much certainty did not get called, they made room for his sadness without absorbing it.\n\nAfterwards, under the crush of hair and wire and human, she found the corridor that had become hers. It smelt like paint cooling and luck. Her phone was where she had left it with the face turned away. She let it stay that way for a minute longer. She let herself lean against the wall as if the wall were something like home. Saj appeared with crisps, which was a kind of sacrament. Dan appeared with sense, which was another. Lorna appeared with paperwork and love disguised as a list. \u201cThere will be more of them now,\u201d she said, meaning vans and lenses and questions and hands. \u201cThere is a percentage of them who will remember they are people and a percentage who will forget. We surround you with the first and keep the second as far as possible. If any of them say \u2018journey\u2019 at you more than once, I am authorised to hiss.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can hiss,\u201d Maisie said. \u201cI hissed at a man once who put his finger into a cake to check it was real.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did he respond,\u201d Lorna asked, looking delighted, as if she were collecting souvenirs of resistance from the field.\n\n\u201cHe apologised to the cake,\u201d Maisie said, and the room, such as it was, laughed and the laughter did the thing it always does when it is honest: improved the air.\n\nBack at the hotel, late and not late, she took the pins out of her hair and put them on the desk in a pattern that could have been a constellation. She washed her face and watched her own skin return like a tide that knew its times. She sat on the bed with her knees up and the duvet compressed under her like the lap of a giant and she allowed herself ten minutes to watch the clip with the dog again, because sometimes the soft thing is the medicine. She texted her mother: Not today, and her mother replied: Well done. There is trifle.\n\nShe wrote in the notebook because if she didn\u2019t, the day would have nowhere to live and might turn into gas. She wrote: I held the quiet and it held me back. She wrote: Wind later. She wrote: Say nothing is a sentence. She drew a dog that looked like a seagull wearing boots and laughed at herself alone in a high room.\n\nSleep came as if it had been watching and waiting for its cue. At three she woke as always and listened to the city shifting its shoulder in the sheets. She thought about the next song without deciding anything. She allowed herself a little luxury and imagined an after that involved a stage she chose, a band that knew her vowels and didn\u2019t ask them to change, a small tour of seaside places where the gulls would pretend to know the choruses, and a caf\u00e9 she could return to in the mornings to dry spoons and be told she was still part of the furniture. She let the image be generous without making promises it couldn\u2019t keep.\n\nIn the morning, the vans were still there and the man with the camera had been replaced by a man with a microphone whose hair looked as if it had been argued with into shape. Downstairs in the lobby a little girl approached wearing a coat the colour of apples and a courage that had been sewn on by somebody careful. She held out a napkin on which she had drawn, in pencil, a person with a big mouth and a dog with a bigger one. \u201cThis is you,\u201d she said, without self-consciousness. \u201cAnd this is the dog. He likes your voice.\u201d\n\nMaisie took the napkin like it was paper and then held it like it was porcelain. \u201cWill you sign it for me,\u201d she asked the girl, because that was the only correct response. The girl wrote her name in the middle of the dog with the seriousness children give to important work. Her mother hovered in the distance, instructing the air to be kind. \u201cThank you,\u201d Maisie said, with the weight such a small transaction deserved. \u201cYou\u2019ve made my day before tea.\u201d\n\nThey had a day off in the schedule, which meant a day in which fewer people would ask her to stand here or be that. She walked a stretch of river with Nova and declined to be photographed on a bench by a man whose camera had learned to forget faces. They went into a museum and looked at paintings of skies, all different, and wondered how it is that people can love the same thing fifty ways. They ate chips from paper and blessed salt aloud as if it were a minor god. They did not talk about fathers or fear. They talked about fruit they didn\u2019t like as children and fruit they pretended to like now, trilobites and haircuts and a woman on the bus who had knitted a hat for the weather and then the weather had decided to change and she wore it cheerful anyway.\n\nBy the time rehearsals resumed, the dog had done two morning shows and one biscuit advert without knowing it. Eastbourne had broken the till drawer twice with the weight of coins. Mrs. Pike had acquired an apron with the words \u201cMouth That Does Good Work\u201d embroidered by a woman who did embroidery when her cat allowed it, and had worn it ironically which, for Mrs. Pike, meant only that she acknowledged it existed. The boy with the skateboard was learning to make coffee without Jai saying \u201cNo, see, tilt,\u201d and the terrier had started sitting outside the Driftwood as if expecting applause. Len had discovered emojis and sent her three of a letter and one of a fish and one of a man who could only be a postman if you believed in miracles. Her mother had sent her a photograph of a trifle that had become a landscape, which she praised without admitting she preferred crumble.\n\nAt the end of that week\u2019s first run-through, Dan stopped her on the way out with a hand that asked only a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re getting good at not apologising,\u201d he said, and the twinkle was only half a twinkle. \u201cWatch for the apology creeping into the smile. It\u2019s a British habit. You can smile without giving something back. Try it in front of the mirror and you\u2019ll see yourself grow half an inch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see myself enough,\u201d she said, but she took it, because he was right and because the work was a thing she liked to hold. In the stairwell between floors she practised two smiles, one that gave away bus fares and the other that didn\u2019t, and was astonished at the difference it made to her own breath. A stagehand coming up with a coil of tape saw her and gave her a look that said, We all try things in stairwells, and kept going.\n\nThere was a night midweek when the hotel felt like the inside of a clock and she went to the bar with the carpet that hid more than it revealed and found a corner where she could be a person having a drink and not a person being assessed. A man came over with the careful tilt of someone with something to say and she braced, then relaxed. It was the camera guy who had laughed with his mouth closed. He said, \u201cThat second verse was clean,\u201d and then, because he was smart, he didn\u2019t say more. She raised her glass and he raised his and they did not talk about anything that could be monetised. It was a relief the size of a thousand small things.\n\nIn bed that night she thought briefly of the message with its five words and for the first time it did not make her ribs flutter. It sat in the corner like a coat nobody was wearing, and that was fine. She slept and dreamed not of the pier in lights but of the caf\u00e9 with the bell that worked and tea towels as prizes and a dog who stole something you cared for and somehow improved it by making it a story. In the morning, she woke and the day organised itself obediently into breakfast, breath, stage, and the kind of work that feels like you could spend your life doing it without minding the weather. She sat for make-up and let someone paint on bravery that matched the bravery she brought and thought, quietly and without theatre, I am doing the thing, and if there was ever a sentence worth getting out of bed for, that was it.",

                              "content": "Chapter Eight began with a newspaper on a breakfast table that did not belong to her, a photograph cropped so closely it felt like a hand over a mouth. She didn\u2019t see it first. A man at the next table rearranged his cutlery into a domestic constellation and tutted at the headline as if the letters had personally misbehaved, then rotated the paper and left the page where anyone could read it, the way people leave half-eaten fruit for birds and tell themselves it\u2019s charity. There was her face, but tighter, and a name beside it she had kept in a drawer with batteries and things you don\u2019t throw away in case fate requires you to prove you once believed in them. The caption did the thing captions do when they want to be both a knife and a handkerchief. It said Proud anyway, as if generosity were a stain that would not come out.\n\nSaj appeared in the breakfast room as if she\u2019d been hiding behind the croissants, which was a trick Maisie wouldn\u2019t put past her. She set down a small pot of jam like a bargaining chip and didn\u2019t look at the paper, which was exactly the kindness required. \u201cWe\u2019re handling it,\u201d she said, in a voice that had the weight of a person placing a lid on a boiling pan. \u201cLegal will call the desk. We say nothing except that you\u2019re at work, which you are, and that your family is not a storyline, which it isn\u2019t. If anybody thrusts a microphone at your mouth with the question, I will place my hand between the microphone and the question, and they will interview my palm. Eat something that forgives you while we do that.\u201d\n\nIt was a neat plan, as most good plans are when they are drawn on clean air before the weather gets involved. The paper was only the first welcome committee. In the lobby, a man with a camera and a boy with a notebook hopped from one foot to the other as if the carpet were lava and only the question could save them. Outside, a van sat like a patient predator, windows darkened to imply important thoughts being had about your life. In her phone, the message multiplied, copied, pasted, embellished, picked up by the pieces of the internet that pretend to be neighbours and love to borrow your sugar. Uncles she\u2019d never met wrote paragraphs about duty and daughters under photos from last summer of a choir in a park, and schoolfriends she hadn\u2019t spoken to since GCSEs suddenly remembered she existed and had always known she was special. Her mother texted: I am not answering the door. Maureen is on guard. We have deployed a tray of biscuits as distraction if necessary. The biscuits are brave.\n\nShe did not cry because crying would have given it a shape, and she refused to hand over architecture to strangers. She ate toast slowly and imagined the toast as an ally, which worked as well as anything. Nova slid into the chair with all the grace of a person who had just been told she looked good in a colour she hated. \u201cThey\u2019ve found my dad too,\u201d she said, light as paper. \u201cDifferent paper, different haircut, same hunger. Saj says to say nothing. I am good at saying nothing when I care. I am not good at saying nothing when I do not care, which is strange.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the river and ignore bridges,\u201d Maisie said, as if rivers were something you could schedule. \u201cFive minutes, then we will come back and behave like a people who live on taped-down marks. We will breathe and pretend there is only room for oxygen.\u201d\n\nThey walked as far as the metal railings and the morning performing its good behaviour. The city presented its best concrete and its least threatening pigeons and three joggers in a row considered not being in the way and failed. It was enough to reset the little gears that had jumped in her chest when she saw the headline. On the way back, a woman passed them carrying a florist\u2019s box that had been designed for the delivery of softness. She stopped, looked at Maisie with a face that did not edit, and said, \u201cYou sang and I felt myself stand up inside,\u201d then went on her way because people have lives, because that is the only thing keeping the world upright.\n\nIn the rehearsal room the piano was already open at the page that made room for knees. Dan stood as if he were about to tell good news in a saner world, and Albie had his guitar in the lap position that means the day is willing. They all knew enough to ignore the buzzing. Work, if you let it, grows hands and shields you because it wants to be done. They went through the song for the third time like people carrying cups carefully. They shaved half a second off a pause not because anyone would notice but because they would, and the noticing would make them sit straighter just before the line that needed straightening. They tried the bridge again with a tilt, and finally the melody accepted their offer. When she sang the line about going home and not meaning geography, she felt the sound sit perfectly in the middle of her mouth and stay there, polite and obstinate.\n\nA runner appeared with a message on a laminated card like a prophecy that had to be wiped between uses. It said MEDIA HOLD: FIRM. Lorna poked her head around the door next, hair doing its two-tasks-at-once thing, and said, \u201cExecutive wants you to do a soft thank-you to \u2018everyone who\u2019s reached out\u2019 when you\u2019re on the couch. Not the name. Not the story. Just a thank-you. You don\u2019t have to. We can ignore it. But if it will help them feel fed and leave you alone, we can try. Your call.\u201d She didn\u2019t look at the paper in her hand that had the word \u201cnarrative\u201d on it in clean type. She looked at Maisie the way you look at a fire that might go everywhere and might also go out and not be the end of the world.\n\n\u201cI can do a thank-you that\u2019s also a do-not,\u201d Maisie said, trying her mouth around the balance and feeling it hold. \u201cI can do a handful of politeness without selling the kitchen. I will talk about kindness and cakes and doors. I will talk about doors.\u201d\n\n\u201cTalk about doors,\u201d Lorna said, with the same small relief she had when a mic worked the first time. \u201cDoors are out of fashion. You can bring them back.\u201d\n\nThe day seemed to have decided not to be generous, so it gave them oddness instead. Halfway through a lighting check, the wind machine for another act fell in love with the switch and refused to be turned off. A, B and C plan tried to coax it back into friendship, and finally a man called Kev, who had the shoulders of a man who had convinced many objects to behave, murmured to it in a soft Midlands tone and the thing sighed and gave up drama. In the corridor, Nova practised wink-smiling at her reflection and announced she was terrible at wink-smiling and would therefore invent a new expression that meant \u201cI am pleased to be here but nobody owns my eyebrows.\u201d In the break room someone had put out a bowl of bananas with a sign that said \u201cPLEASE EAT ME,\u201d then someone else had crossed out \u201cME\u201d and written \u201cBANANAS,\u201d and this was somehow exactly the size of joke everyone could handle.\n\nThe caf\u00e9 clip was still rising like bread left in a warm room. Mrs. Pike had sent a photograph of herself with a man from the council in front of the pastry display. The man had his serious tie on and a grin like the top of a lighthouse and was shaking hands with a tray. The caption, in Jai\u2019s handwriting, said: Council recognises tart\u2019s contribution to civic morale. The terrier had, according to the boy with the skateboard, been recognised twice on the seafront with the phrase \u201cThere he is,\u201d which had made the dog look over his shoulder as if perhaps the other he was just behind him. Len sent no commentary, just a photograph of the horizon sliced by a gull and underneath it a row of stamps lined up like teeth, which was either an accident or a poem.\n\nBy the time the red light woke properly for the live part, Maisie had reached the calm that comes not from courage but from the body being sensible. She took her place as if she had been born there and left twice and returned because it was the only reasonable choice. The stage had been made into the kind of room her song needed, which is to say the room was acting like a room and not a spaceship. Albie\u2019s face had settled into that calm he inherited from older women and boats. The audience had arranged themselves into one large listening creature. She sang, and the note that mattered came out dressed like itself and not a guest, and she did not think of newspapers except in the way you think of ships when you are on a field; as a different kind of distance.\n\nThe trouble came two bars from the end, when the monitor in her ear misheard the world and threw back a sound that wasn\u2019t hers. It was the kind of mistake that makes people bargain with physics. She saw Dan\u2019s head turn in the darkness, saw Albie\u2019s neck muscle twitch at the edge of the last chord, saw the floor conduct calm. She did the thing you do when a kettle suddenly stops sounding like a kettle. She took the earpiece out, quick, one motion, and put it in her palm like an egg. She stepped half an inch closer to the mouth of the room, which is to say the audience, and trusted that air is not just an absence. For four bars she sang naked of equipment and the room remembered it had been built to carry voices before it was taught to react to cameras. It carried her. The note found the ceiling and did not get lost on the way back. When she finished, the quiet that followed the quiet was generous. Somewhere a headset muttered a swear of admiration in an accent you could not quite place.\n\nBackstage, people who were paid to be calm allowed themselves miniature celebrations, the luxury of impressed eyebrows and professional smiles that almost broke into parties. Dan pressed her shoulder in the exact place that said \u201cwork\u201d and \u201cwell done,\u201d and Lorna told her she would never mention wind again in relation to Executive\u2019s dreams. Saj handed her water that had been cold in an intelligent way and said, \u201cI think you just started a trend called \u2018remembering how to human.\u2019 If they ask you about it, it was a technical. If they ask you about the paper, doors.\u201d\n\nOn the couch, under lights that pretend to be scrutiny and are mostly heat, she did her thank-you. She thanked people for messages that were kind and said nothing about the ones that were not and did not at any point perform an anecdote. She spoke about spoons and kettles and doors, and the host tried to turn spoons into fathers because that is what hosts must try to do if they want to keep their chair. She took the word back and made it about tea, and the audience, which is a clever animal when trained, made the noise people make when they recognise someone refusing a story without being rude to the furniture. It was, in the scale of victories, small enough to fit in a coat pocket, and important enough to hold warm with your hands.\n\nThat night the vans multiplied at the kerb like mushrooms after rain. Saj reorganised exits like a general who had never lost a battle because she refused to fight one she couldn\u2019t win. In the revolving door a man in a coat that didn\u2019t fit tried a question with her name on it and she smiled with the correct ratio of teeth to restraint and said, \u201cNot today,\u201d and walked, and the walk was a kind of language. Upstairs, the corridor did its good work of purring. Nova texted a string of emojis that appeared to mean either \u201cI have discovered eyeliner\u201d or \u201cI have tamed a mythical beast,\u201d and then arrived and threw herself on the bed as if gravity were optional. \u201cYou witch,\u201d she said, full of love that was relief. \u201cYou made an accident look like a choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a choice,\u201d Maisie said. \u201cThe choice not to panic. It turns out I have a choice. I have more choices than I thought. I might start choosing for sport.\u201d\n\n\u201cChoose chips,\u201d Nova said, already half asleep in a position that would make a chiropractor sigh, and then said, blurred, \u201cThey\u2019re going to make you talk about him again. Just\u2026 don\u2019t be the soup. Be the bowl.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a bowl,\u201d Maisie said, which in another life would have been an odd sentence to say to a friend while both were fully clothed, but here, in this life, was doctrine. She tucked a blanket over Nova as if preparing a small animal for hibernation. Then she sat in the chair by the window, because chairs in hotel rooms are there for people to sit in while remembering. A small square envelope was tucked under the door in that particular way hotel staff manage when they want you to believe magic still exists. There was a neat hand on the front that belonged to nobody in her modern life, the slanted script that predates keyboards. Inside was a recipe card, stained with butter in a corner, for jam tarts. The ingredients were in Len\u2019s slow capitals, each line a kindness. At the bottom, he had written: Remember the crust holds the jam and not the other way round. Under that, like a PS that had slipped out of the mouth of the first sentence: Also, I told the man at the gate that he was trespassing on my good mood. He apologised to my hedges.\n\nShe slept with the card under her pillow, which did nothing and also did everything. In the morning, the paper had become other papers, and the van had become a different van. The city wore yesterday as a scarf and considered the day with a professional face. Saj had arranged a decoy exit and three decoy smiles and an actual one for luck. In the lift, a housekeeper with a trolley full of beautifully folded forgiveness looked at Maisie and then away and then back and said, \u201cYou were brave when the ear thing went,\u201d in the tone a person uses to name a colour when paint has dried. It was a small ribbon she pinned to her inside.\n\nThe day off that wasn\u2019t off landed unexpectedly in the schedule like snow that had looked on the forecast and decided to be less trouble. It rained politely, the sort of rain that wants to be liked. She went to Eastbourne because she could. The train did not object. The platform received her without applause, which was a relief so pure it made her clumsy for a second. She walked through the underpass and the town opened itself like it always had, indifferent to fame and gossip and heavily stapled schedules, and therefore a kind of church.\n\nAt the Driftwood, Jai had constructed a shrine to the dog consisting of a saucer with a single biscuit and a sign reading HONEST THIEF. Mrs. Pike swatted away a camera crew from a show with a name that used the word celebrity as if it were a medical term and told them they could film the outside of her bun if they filed a request in writing. The boy with the skateboard reported that his gran had waved at her on the telly and then complained that the lighting wasn\u2019t flattering to their wallpaper, which meant she was feeling better. The terrier came in without being invited, because it had become impossible to tell that dog where to be, and it sat at her feet with the dignity of an animal who had been to London in spirit.\n\nShe made tea because sometimes being useful is more important than being adored. She wiped down a table because cloths are therapy with texture. A tourist from a motorway town said, \u201cOh, it really is you,\u201d as if she had been supposed to be an actor hired to play herself. She cut cake and talked about sugar with a woman who told her she had watched the performance from her hospital bed and had clapped so gently with the back of her hand that the nurse cried. She went down to the pier with Len because he consented to walk if the wind was in a giving mood and stopped at the part where the boards sound like music. He told her about a parcel that had arrived open and a note he had written that said, \u201cArrived in this condition,\u201d and the way the recipient had phoned to say thank you for the honesty. \u201cPeople think honesty is expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is cheaper than the alternative. Remember that when you are tempted to buy silence on credit.\u201d\n\nShe told him about the recipe card and he grinned like a boy and claimed no knowledge and then asked if the dog in question had forgiven the tart. On the way back, the man from the promenade saw her again and began a sentence with \u201cYour father\u2014\u201d and she stopped, and held up a hand like a person crossing a road at a zebra, and said, \u201cNot today,\u201d gently, like a person pointing out a cliff to a visitor, and he flushed, and he said, \u201cSorry, love,\u201d and they both carried on being human, which felt like a win on a day with rain.\n\nThe next show week had decided to be hard. The theme was not a theme but a box with \u201cbig songs\u201d printed on it in a font that made people feel unnecessary pressure. Executive wanted power and wind. The lights wanted to be edited into something that could be put online with a word like \u201ciconic.\u201d Dan wanted vowels and rest and a room. Saj wanted doors. Maisie wanted the exact smallness she could hold without giving away her bones. They compromised by building something that felt like a streetlight at dusk. She chose an older song that had nothing to prove and therefore proved everything. Executive raised an eyebrow that had been paid for and asked if perhaps a medley might be more commercial, and she said, \u201cI am not a medley,\u201d which made Lorna snort into her notes because she treasured every sentence that forced the room to be sharper than it had been.\n\nAlbie\u2019s week had sharp corners. He had been bottom two for reasons outside of talent and inside of fate, and he was tired in his eyes, which is the kind of tired that retinol cannot touch. He smiled and said, \u201cWe move,\u201d which meant \u201cI will stand up even if my knees are bored,\u201d and his hands did beautiful things to the guitar that you only notice if you have ever tried to make a thing respond to being asked nicely. Nova had been assigned a costume that looked like a metaphor and refused to wear it, which led to a corridor conversation that ended with her wearing trousers and a grin that scared three men and a frog. They all stopped to eat at a table designed by a person who believed elbows are rude, and they put their elbows on it with intent, and that small act of rebellion tasted exactly like chips would have tasted if the rehearsal had finished on time.\n\nThe show went as shows do when more people are watching: like an animal trained to accept noise in exchange for food. There were better songs than the songs deserved and worse ones than talent allowed. There was a boy who forgot a line and remembered grace. There was a woman with a dress that had opinions and an audience that adored it. When it was Maisie\u2019s turn, the room gave her the courtesy of filling the right places and not the wrong ones. She looked at Albie across the stage and felt for a second what it would be like to do this without him, and she had to breathe twice before the first line would come. She sang and the song did what old songs do when asked by a new mouth; it yielded and it argued and in the end it sat down beside her and shared the view.\n\nThe judges found adjectives in their pockets and some of them were the right ones. The host asked her if being \u201cour caf\u00e9 songbird\u201d felt like a responsibility, and she said it felt like a shift rota, and there was laughter in the right places. When the results came, they came like the tide only if the tide had to pause and listen to a sponsor. Albie\u2019s name was late. It was the kind of late that makes you count the names you can\u2019t see and reckon odds and push down doom with your knee. When it came, it did not come. He stood well. He went to sing for his life with steady hands and a throat that did not betray him, and still the room and the maths and the map of the week decided otherwise. He bowed like a boat at a dock because he knew how to leave with dignity and without interpretation. He hugged her and his arms said the thing his mouth couldn\u2019t say because not crying in public is a game people play even when the rules hurt. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it,\u201d he said, the exact three words he had to give away, and then he went off in the manner of men taught by older women, which is to say upright and unblaming.\n\nShe didn\u2019t sleep much that night. Sleep was there, hovering with the bedside lamp and the hotel pen and the usual humility, but every time she reached it, a thought tugged her sleeve and asked if she had remembered to be kind, if she had stolen any lines, if she could have argued harder for anything that mattered, if she could bear doing this without the steady companionship of a guitar that understood her more than some people would. At three, a message arrived from Len like a lighthouse blink. It said: Boats leave. Harbours remain. Don\u2019t turn into a harbour. Be a boat with a kettle. It was the strangest, dearest sentence, and somehow it allowed her to close her eyes with something like peace.\n\nMorning did not ask permission. It found her and put tea in her hand and sent her downstairs to a room where Executive had drawn new arrows on the whiteboard. The gull had acquired an expression. There was a fresh plan for a duet week that involved pairing her with someone whose name made publicity men purr. Lorna was going to find the boat. Dan had already located his replacement, a house guitarist with long fingers and listening ears who introduced himself as Marta and shook her hand like a promise. Saj wrote DOORS in the corner and underlined it until the pen made a squeak that sounded like victory.\n\nThey went to the river because the city had given them one that morning and it seemed ungrateful not to look. Nova walked with her hands in her pockets as if pockets had been designed to hold courage. \u201cAre you all right,\u201d she asked, because asking is work too, and Maisie said, \u201cI am sad and I am grateful and I am still wanting to sing,\u201d and that was the most honest inventory she was capable of. They paused on a bridge with the usual padlocks and all the ordinary tourists and it occurred to her that nothing remarkable was visible from that angle, that the remarkable was happening in a hundred kitchens and a thousand birds and in one girl from a town where the tide has opinions who had decided she would have them too.\n\nHer phone vibrated, not with a van or a paper or a man in a coat, but with the name she had left un-open like a cupboard that smells of something you aren\u2019t ready to face. It was not five words this time. It was two, and they were the only two that made sense and caused trouble in equal measure. It said: I\u2019m here. She looked at the words as if they were city pigeons, familiar and opportunistic. She was in a place with pigeons and also in a place where the gulls waited. She could not control which bird came closer. She slid the phone back into her pocket and let the words sit with the crumbs.\n\nThe caf\u00e9 sent her a photograph of a new chalkboard in Jai\u2019s carefully chaotic hand. It read: SOUP OF THE DAY: BOUNDARIES. COMES WITH BREAD. She sent back a drawing of a door with a lock and a heart and under it a kettle and the words I\u2019m a boat, and Jai replied with a string of sailor emojis that did not exist but should. She messaged Albie to say nothing at all in sentences and everything in spaces and he wrote back a picture of the sea near his mother\u2019s, flat as a sheet, and the phrase Play on, which could have been about music or life or the way some people give you exactly not enough and somehow it is enough.\n\nShe went to rehearsal and her feet found the floor and her mouth found the note and her breath found the chair behind the word. She stood on the mark that had had her name written on it so many times it had become part of the stage, and she looked up into lights that were trying their best and she said to herself under the noise and the plan and the want and the fear: I know my bones. She said it again, because there are sentences you are supposed to repeat until the room learns them with you. She imagined the Driftwood quiet with the day\u2019s last cups, the lemon paint forgiving faults the way good colours do, the dog asleep beside the door dreaming of tarts, Len turning off a light with the seriousness of a ceremony, her mother washing a spoon and thinking of old songs and nonsense, and she let the picture make a home for the bit of her that had room for no more newspapers.\n\nThe duet week was going to be a circus. It was the kind of television where somebody in a high room imagined chemistry like a chemical and then pretended it could be measured with ratings. They paired her with a man whose first name was enough, who had been loud ten years ago and then quieter and now loud again with the authority of a person who had sold both vinyl and streaming. He arrived in rehearsal in a jacket the colour of someone else\u2019s mood and hugged her like a cousin at a funeral and said, \u201cYou do your thing, I won\u2019t get in your way,\u201d which was either humility or a plan. His voice slid under hers like a hand under a plate; she could not tell yet if he would tilt or steady. They chose a song that did not make anyone roll their eyes, and they agreed on a key that did not betray either of their ageing frets. He told her a story about performing drunk in Hull in 2009 that had nothing to do with anything and somehow helped.\n\nLater, in the corridor with the carpet that forgave ridiculous shoes, she found Saj leaning against the radiator which still did not work. \u201cHow do you feel about tomorrow,\u201d Saj asked, not a producer now but a person with a face at the end of a day. \u201cI will not accept \u2018fine\u2019 unless it comes with evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like a chair with three good legs,\u201d Maisie said. \u201cIt stands but you shouldn\u2019t sit suddenly. I feel like a boat with a kettle. I feel like the city is starting to recognise my walk and I am getting proud of the way my ankles don\u2019t lie. I feel like if one more stranger says the word proud at me I will put it in a jar and label it and never open it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Saj said, which is to say she heard everything. \u201cWe will keep jars. We will keep labels. We will open the ones we choose when we choose. And if they ask you again on the couch about him, I will hiss, and you will be the bowl and not the soup, and we will go for chips that are salted like a religion and eat them in defiance of narrative.\u201d\n\nThey laughed, and the laugh repaired something you could not name. Then the building breathed, juddered, swallowed its own noise, laid out its corridors like a promise, and handed her back to the part of the story where the stage waits to see if you will betray it. She did not. She went on. She sang. The room did the thing. And outside, where vans learn the habits of foxes, the world watched and had opinions, as it always will, while somewhere with lemon paint and a bell that works and a dog who steals only what is worth telling, a kettle boiled, and boiled, and boiled.",

It spread itself over days like a map on a table big enough for elbows, and everyone leaned in until their forearms made borders. The duet had aired and become a thousand small edits, some of which were kind and some of which wore kindness as a hat, and now the show had decided that the correct answer to noise was more music. Semi-finals were a word people said like superstition, not looking it directly in the eye in case it got ideas. The schedule developed muscles in new places. Someone put a whiteboard in a room that had never hosted a whiteboard and on it wrote words like momentum and jeopardy in handwriting that looked like the receiver of many emails.\n\nThe man with one name sent flowers that were the kind you suspect would sue if you overwatered them, along with a note that said, \u201cYou made me sing better, which is rude, but I forgive you.\u201d She left the bouquet where the runners could smell achievement and slid the card into her notebook as if it might learn to be a lyric if kept warm. Nova had slept through two alarms and woke with the complicated face of a person who had dreamt they were chased by microphones. Albie sent a photograph of a stage the size of a living room somewhere in a town without trains and the caption: Room was room. They clapped at the right places and someone cried in an honest way. He added a second message that said, in admirable defiance of the show\u2019s insistence on being everyone's mother: Eat. Drink. Breathe down not up.\n\nExecutive called a meeting in the room with polite glass and the whiteboard gull, now wearing a cape added by an unknown hand. He smiled the way a person smiles when they have bought the right cheese from the wrong shop and intend to serve it with panache. \u201cSemis,\u201d he said, and the word landed on the table and tried to look casual. \u201cWe want scale without silliness. We want intimacy that reads big. And we want an original. It\u2019s time. Can you deliver something that feels like you, but also like us, but more you than us, while still being us? Spare with a hook. Honest without liability. Maybe a key change if it doesn\u2019t make us look desperate.\u201d\n\nFor a second she thought she had misheard, that perhaps he had finally succumbed to the temptation of irony. Lorna tilted her head as if eavesdropping on an idea. Dan folded his arms the way choirs fold arms when the soloist is family. Saj breathed out between teeth in a way the building recognised as her preparing to run at a wall. \u201cYou want her to do her own song,\u201d Saj said, confirming the universe had not flipped. \u201cYou want her bones in a melody, on live television, with three rehearsals and a band that can learn anything but prefers to be respected. You want quiet that can be heard in rooms where people shout. You want the thing she is most protective of on a night where the vans will breed. I love it. But if she says no, you will accept no as if it were a sonnet.\u201d\n\nMaisie had been writing in corners of days since Brighton. She had verses that had grown legs overnight and choruses that had sulked under beds until tempted with biscuits. She had one, though, that had lived with her long enough to know her walk. It had been born in a night where the kettle had been a metronome and the sea had sent a message in a language you can only read from a window. It wasn\u2019t tidy. It wasn\u2019t designed for confetti. It had a line about a spoon drawer that would make the internet write \u201cquirky\u201d with the kind of affection that is a trap and a kiss. But it was true, and it wouldn\u2019t apologize for what it wasn\u2019t. She looked at Dan and then at Saj and then at the whiteboard gull and felt the peculiar courage that comes when your fear makes tea for your stubbornness and they decide to be allies. \u201cI have one,\u201d she said, threatening to smile and not. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have a bridge that begs. It has a middle that holds. It knows where it\u2019s going and where it refuses to go. I\u2019d like to try it.\u201d\n\nExecutive blinked like a man who had been surprised by an honest biscuit at a networking lunch. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to hear it,\u201d he said, which was reasonable and also ridiculous because hearing it in a room with bad carpet would have nothing to do with hearing it under lights. Lorna raised her pen an inch and put it down again without writing, because sometimes the recording is already in your head. Dan nodded as if he had been expecting this sentence since he met her. Saj made a small note that turned into three phone calls to the legal department because original songs come with paperwork like weather.\n\nThey took the song to a rehearsal room that didn\u2019t mind being christened and closed the door the way people close curtains when the house across the street suddenly takes an interest. She sang it through once like a confession. She sang it again like a plan. The third time she moved a word and the room moved with it. Dan played the piano with the caution of a man transporting a cake up a narrow staircase. Marta, who had replaced Albie with competence and a kindness that never announced itself, found a line inside the chord and brought it out like a thread. Nova listened with her face and then held the silence afterwards as if it had been given to her to mind. \u201cIt\u2019s yours,\u201d she said simply. \u201cAnd it\u2019s ours because you\u2019re letting it be. I hate you a little.\u201d\n\nSaj listened with her mouth for once and not just for her ears. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to keep it away from people who will try to put a hat on it that says \u2018ballad\u2019 in gold,\u201d she said, but her eyes had gone soft in a way Maisie had learned to translate as an internal yes. Executive demanded a hook and discovered that a hook can be a kindness if you don\u2019t pull too hard. Lorna suggested a staging with less furniture and more air. The lighting designer, a man with the soul of a moth and the posture of a poet, proposed \u201cjust enough to make it legible,\u201d and for once everyone agreed without needing to be the one who had the idea first.\n\nWhile they built a stage for a song that had been born in a kitchen, the outside world did the thing it always does when it smells an opportunity to write itself in. A storm blew in from nowhere with a name that should have belonged to a dowager aunt. It pinned itself to the coast and shook out its skirts over Eastbourne with enthusiasm. The pier sulked under a tarpaulin sky and the gulls lowered their standards and shouted at bins. The news did a segment about old towns and old weather and sent a camera to ask a man in a cap what he felt, and he told them he felt like putting a jumper on, which earned him a small fame and a plate of biscuits. Jai sent a video of himself standing in the doorway of the Driftwood, hair at an angle, mug in hand, declaring, \u201cWe are open. We are always open. The soup is so committed it has turned into a stew,\u201d and in the background the terrier appeared, took a large interest in a fallen napkin, and then left with purpose. Mrs. Pike texted to say that wind was undignified and that she\u2019d informed it personally.\n\nHer mother called from the hallway with the good reception and spoke in the clipped voice of a person trying not to be listened to by a house. \u201cYour song,\u201d she said, wasting no sentences. \u201cDo you do that thing I tell you not to do, where you smile too much to prove you\u2019re not afraid. Don\u2019t smile at the song if it doesn\u2019t ask you to. Smile at the people when it is done. The middle should look like you are reading a letter only you can see.\u201d She paused and in the pause Maisie could hear the quiet of their kitchen and the presence of a spoon drawer she could reach with her eyes shut. \u201cAlso, Maureen says the clouds have been badly brought up.\u201d\n\nLen wrote on a postcard from a shop that didn\u2019t sell postcards, \u201cIf the roof rattles, it means it\u2019s loyal to the house. It is announcing itself. Rattling is not failure. P.S. The dog found shelter in the chapel doorway like someone with a grievance and was offered a biscuit by a woman who believes in angels. He will no doubt behave worse tomorrow as a result.\u201d The card had a picture of a lighthouse and a price sticker that had been peeled off and replaced with a lower one, as if the sea had gone on sale. She put the postcard beside the recipe card under her pillow because talismans breed when you let them.\n\nThe night before the semi, the vans were already nesting outside the hotel like boxes with telemetry. The lobby had grown a layer of anticipation that made people raise their voices or lower them for effect. In a hallway painted the colour of conversations that go well, Nova pressed a sheet of paper into her hand, the cheap hotel stationery transformed by the act. \u201cIf they ask me about him again, I will say this,\u201d Nova said, breathing carefully, \u201cand then I will not say anything else. Will you read it to see if it is too much of a fence and not enough of a door.\u201d It wasn\u2019t. It was two sentences that said \u201cI\u2019m at work\u201d and \u201cNo,\u201d with such graciousness they felt like a hug you gave to your own boundaries. Maisie kissed her cheek and told her the fence had flowers and that was more than anyone could demand.\n\nThe morning decided to start without her and then remembered to invite her along. She woke into the kind of quiet that belongs to buildings before everyone remembers their lines. The air lay obedient. The city coughed into its sleeve. In the mirror she looked like a woman who had spent a month learning not to apologise. It suited her. Breakfast was a negotiation with toast and time. Dan appeared at her shoulder to murmur about breath and quietly engineer her into a better key for early talking. Saj slid into a chair and handed her a day the way people hand you a baby: This is happening, it is beautiful, don\u2019t drop it, and if you do, we will tell nobody.\n\nThe run-through went wrong in acceptable ways and right in one very important way: the song did, in rehearsal, the thing the song was supposed to do. It sat in the room like a chair and invited people to sit in it properly. The crew looked up from their phones more often than they were obliged to. A rigging man with hands like rope said to nobody in particular, \u201cMy mum will like that one,\u201d and then coughed to pretend he hadn\u2019t meant to speak. The stage manager with kind eyes and a count-in finger touched his earpiece and said, \u201cAgain from the chorus to make the cameras feel safe,\u201d and the cameras felt safer. Executive appeared, tapped the air like a conductor of emails, and said only, \u201cDon\u2019t change the second verse,\u201d which for him was love poetry.\n\nOutside, the storm arrived in a way that suggested it had read the call sheet. Rain came down with a professionalism you had to admire. Wind did not ask to be liked. On a different show, they would have moved a set piece and pretended to be the only thing that mattered. Here, they closed two doors and told the dog to stay inside if the hat blew off. Mrs. Pike set a mug down too hard and said, \u201cI am not interested in weather unless it peels paint, and I don\u2019t mean emotionally,\u201d and everyone took comfort from her refusal to be impressed by the sky.\n\nTwo hours before showtime, a boy with a microphone who had been a boy with a notebook the week before materialised in the corridor with the carpet that forgives mistakes. He stood in front of her with the confidence of someone certain that he was about to pluck a story like a ripe pear. \u201cHave you seen the statement,\u201d he said without greeting, holding his phone like a mirror to a life she did not recall signing for. \u201cHe\u2019s said he\u2019s in town. That he\u2019s here. That he wants to meet. That he\u2019s proud. That\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot today,\u201d she said, and the words had become a coat she could find with her eyes shut. \u201cNot here. Not during work. Not because you waited by a door.\u201d The boy blinked, young enough that perhaps someone at home would see this clip later and tell him to eat more, sleep more, ask fewer questions shaped like knives. Saj slid between them with the ease of a person who has moved between teeth and skin before, and the boy was invited to consider the weather elsewhere. Maisie stood still until her skin settled back on her bones, then walked to a room with a piano and a woman called Marta and a man called Dan and a piece of paper where the second verse would not change.\n\nBack home, the pier\u2019s boards sang a wet song to people who had chosen to walk anyway. Len had pulled his chair closer to the window because he preferred to watch weather rather than listen to it as rumour. The terrier lay in a complicated loaf by the heater, dreaming small running dreams. Her mother had put bowls under two leaks as if this were an arrangement she had made for visitors. Jai updated the chalkboard to read: SANDWICH OF THE DAY: PROPRIETY. COMES WITH PICKLE. Mrs. Pike told a customer that perhaps this was not the afternoon for iced coffee unless they were trying to prove a point to the gods. Eastbourne was being Eastbourne, and that had become, somehow, the anchor she carried with her to rooms with ceilings that changed colour on command.\n\nThey let her go third because there is a superstition about third that nobody will write down. Dressing felt less like costume and more like polite cooperation between fabric and shoulder. The dress did not try to be a metaphor. The shoes remembered not to lie. The earpiece behaved like a small bird that had been tamed without cruelty. In the wings, Nova bounced in place because bodies are clever, and Lorna put three fingers on the white of the doorframe, which might have been a habit and might have been a prayer. Saj checked a watch that was never for time but for weather, legal, and doors.\n\nThe room, when she stepped into it, did the thing it had to or everything else would have been pointless. It gave itself over to listening. She could feel the audience\u2019s weight the way you feel a cat decide to stay on your lap. Marta gave her that half-smile that says, We\u2019ll go now, and then they went. The first line came out like it had been waiting all week to be allowed to be itself. It had kitchen in it and caf\u00e9 in it and a boy with a skateboard in it and a woman with a bun who terrifies nonsense for sport. It had tea in it and tide, and the dog was somehow in the vowel without having to be thanked. The second line was a corridor she had built; she walked it with the familiarity you earn only by turning the same handle until it fits your palm. The chorus made a promise about here-ness that did not need to tell you where here was to be true.\n\nSomewhere in the second verse she felt the thing that happens when a song stops being a song and starts being an address. It is not applause. It is not a noise. It is a shift in a breathing animal. People lean in. People stop preparing a reaction. People take a word home to test it against their own cupboards. The bridge\u2014really a low arch, because that is how she builds them\u2014was the place where most people would have wanted a bit of shout. She lowered instead. She gave the room a soft thing and asked it not to drop it, and it didn\u2019t. In the last chorus, when someone less stubborn would have lifted a key to tell the room how to feel, she kept hers and let the melody do the lifting, and the relief in the audience was a heat you could have used for bread.\n\nWhen she finished, there was applause like rain on a tin roof: steady, enveloping, homely. The judges said their words, which this time were mostly words that meant \u201cwe saw you\u201d and \u201cwe will pretend we allowed this in case anyone asks us later whose idea it was.\u201d The host asked if this was about anyone and she said, looking at the audience and then at the camera as if it were a gull who had done its homework, \u201cIt\u2019s about a kitchen, and a town, and a day where you remember you promised something to yourself and keep it,\u201d and he blinked, and nodded, and moved on because a live show is a river with stones you can\u2019t sit on for too long.\n\nBackstage, Dan put his hands on her shoulders the way a builder checks a wall that isn\u2019t going anywhere and said, \u201cYou did the thing,\u201d which for a man who thinks adjectives are spare parts, not decorations, was an ovation. Marta grinned and put her guitar down gently as if it were a child who had finally fallen asleep. Nova cried for the precise amount of time that counts as hydration and then stopped as if on a timer. Lorna texted someone a single exclamation mark and then hid her phone under a folder as if the exclamation mark were confidential. Saj\u2019s eyes went glassy for a second, which means only that she had removed her armour to oil it.\n\nIn Eastbourne, under a sky that had run out of adjectives, Len took his hat off and put it back on without needing a reason. The terrier sat up when the chorus came and then lay down again when it realized that singing does not always lead to tarts. Mrs. Pike said, \u201cShe can come back and do the sugar,\u201d as if the matter had been under debate at a council level. Jai filmed the bell as it announced a woman with a wet scarf and edited text over it that read: When your friend makes the air behave, and then served two hot chocolates to teenagers shaking for reasons that had nothing to do with cold.\n\nIn the results, the floor remembered how to tilt. Names did the thing names do when they become heavy and end up on other people\u2019s tongues. There is a way a person fails to move under telling and a way a person dances without leaving the spot they\u2019re standing on, and she had learned both by now. Her name was called when it should have been, which is to say not so early it courted hate and not so late it looked like a miracle. Nova got through because the nation is not, after all, entirely opposed to trousers. A girl with a throat like a cathedral did not, and cried generously and still looked like a woman and not a wound. Someone made a speech about journeys that was not unbearable. People were human, and then they went to bed.\n\nAfter the show, the vans waited like patient sharks and Saj steered her into a door that led to a corridor that led to a lift that led to a hallway that did not have carpet that forgave everything, only most things. On the bed in her room lay an envelope with her name in that same careful pre-keyboard hand. It had domed a little with rain and then dried and kept its dignity. Inside was a letter, simple and small. Not five words. Not two. Enough to make a day reorder itself by an inch. It said, \u201cI won\u2019t come to your work. I am proud elsewhere. I will write, not turn up. I can be not a hole. I can be a coat on a peg. If you want.\u201d It had a phone number at the bottom and a name that had once been a word you could bruise your mouth on if you said it at the wrong time. She put the paper down because her hands had decided to stop. She made tea because kettles had been invented for this exact reason. She stood at the window and watched the city do late-night and early shift and resolve nothing at all.\n\nShe didn\u2019t answer. She wrote nothing. She put the letter under the recipe card like adults do when they are trying to be their most intelligent selves and leave decisions until after sleep. She texted her mother a sentence composed entirely of verbs without subject or object and received, three minutes later, a photograph of a spoon and a heart and a door. Len sent nothing, which was a kindness so precise it might have been a surgical instrument. She took pins out of her hair and laid them in a pattern that looked like a boat if you wanted it to and a hedgehog if you didn\u2019t. She washed the brave off and found the other kind underneath. She went to bed and let the room be a room, not a machine.\n\nIn the middle of the night the storm came back like a forgotten appointment and rattled the glass with professional gusto. Somewhere a siren found a road and performed purpose. In her dream she was on the pier in weather that couldn\u2019t decide and the fairy lights had elected a leader. She was holding a tart and the dog was giving her advice in a language made mostly of blinking. The sea came in and went out and in again because that is all it knows and all it needs to know. When she woke, there was the sound of the city taking a breath, and for a moment she did not think of cameras or papers or men with shirts that mean meetings. She thought of a spoon drawer and a note that had been waiting to be let out and the exact weight of a mug in her hand, and she said out loud, to the ceiling that had listened to hundreds of people being brave in their sleep, \u201cI am here,\u201d not loud, not for the record, just to remind her mouth how to say it.\n\nMorning arrived without asking and brought with it decisions shaped like cups. Lorna appeared with news about a theme that would not be obeyed. Dan arrived with a piano under his arm, figuratively, ready to argue with a key. Saj arrived with doors, as usual, with a look that said, Pack your coat and your no and your yes in that order. Nova arrived with a face that had made peace with trousers. Executive arrived with a new arrow for the whiteboard and the gull now had a scarf. The hotel had run out of the good jam. The city remembered how to be kind. The week had turned into a staircase and she put her foot on the next step, which is the only intelligent thing to do with stairs. The sea out there kept doing sea, and Eastbourne kept being a town with a bell and a lemon wall and a dog who had accidentally become national morale, and if the story had decided to be a story, well, she would keep the bones and lend the skin and make sure the song went where it needed to go.",
