     "novel_text": "On the morning the mist rolled off the Ouse like steam from an overworked kettle, he ran. He had run that path so often that even his feet seemed to know the bends and the ruts by a private memory. Over the low pedestrian bridge behind the village hall, past the hedge that kept trying to grow into the lane, under the glare of a sky that couldn't decide whether to be grey forever or crack and show some blue. Brampton was still half-asleep, curtains not yet drawn, newspaper man whistling low as he folded the Hunts Post through letter boxes. The grass along the embankment listened for him and gave way. Rafi leaned forward and let his lungs climb hot.\n\nHe ran as a way of holding himself together. Some people stitched quilts, some kept notebooks of birds; Rafi laced trainers and counted the tempo of his footfalls like the beat of a song that could not end. He liked how the world simplified when he moved quickly, cutting it into breath-sized pieces. There were days he counted his worries as lampposts and left them behind like the morning\u2019s litter.\n\nOn that morning, his breath visible in the sharp air, he saw the old man with the terrier again. They had shared nods for months and never a word. Today, the terrier's coat wore frost and its nose was a sawdust pink. The man raised a hand anyway. Rafi lifted his fingers off his gloves in the wet, quick British style of greeting reserved for people you don't know but see always. And kept going.\n\nHe turned back at the mound of earth where someone had half-started to plant a hedge and never finished. He made a private map of the village: where he had once tripped when he was fifteen and knocked out his two front teeth, where a girl had kissed him at dusk and it had been more gentle than he'd guessed, where he had shouted at his dad on the footpath and then wanted to swallow his words back like old gum. Each corner was a story. He ran through his own book every morning, footnote after footnote. He was twenty-six now. He could feel the oldness trying to settle around the edges, and he outran it as long as he could.\n\nHe timed his finish so he could heat the kettle for his mother before she came down. Habit. The front door stuck like a living thing that did not want to be woken. He shouldered it. The hallway smelled of damp wool and the faint ghosts of cumin. The house wasn't large; the light had to take a breath before it reached the far corners. On the fridge, the pinboard held doctor's letters and charity flyers, and a Polaroid from when his dad had decided a photo with the old Peugeot was something families did.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d his mother said, even though she hadn't seen him yet. Her voice came from the top of the stairs, then her feet eased down each step with the care of someone negotiating a price. Maya had a cardigan for every month and a scarf for every cardigan. Today\u2019s was cerulean, a little frayed. She wore house shoes that made her look like a neat little boat. She touched her son's shoulder as she passed him on the way to her chair. \u201cTea,\u201d she added, unnecessary and affectionate both.\n\n\u201cAlready thinking of it,\u201d Rafi said. His hair still held the cold outside, and tiny drops flecked his eyelashes where the fog had settled. He rubbed his hands on a towel that always seemed to need washing no matter how many times it was washed.\n\n\u201cYou were gone long,\u201d she said, settling into her chair like a landing bird.\n\n\u201cI added the loop.\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn't your knee\u2014\u201d she began.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he said, quick enough to make her smile to herself at how children grew old but not old enough that they stopped cutting their mothers off in the name of their own bodies. He set the kettle and stared at it as if watching could make it boil faster.\n\nThey ate porridge, which his mother salted lightly before she remembered he preferred honey. She reached for the honey and he laughed and took it, and they were quiet then in that way that belongs to people who have known each other\u2019s mornings for decades. In the middle of that quiet, Rafi's phone hummed.\n\nHe didn't look at it.\n\n\u201cYou're not looking?\u201d Maya said, because she herself could not resist checking a message as if it might change the planet\u2019s spin.\n\n\u201cNot yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cMust be important to hum,\u201d she said.\n\nHe thought of the email he had sent two months ago that still had not received a reply, about work at the new distribution centre. He thought of the message he had written and rewritten to the producers of that show. He had auditioned in Manchester on an impulse and then pretended to forget he had done it. He had walked onto a stage lined with tape and shadows and zoomed lens, and tried to explain to a room of strangers how a running routine could be a thing people watched. He had lined up boxes and hurdles and he had leapt them to music, and he'd told a story with his body about leaving and returning, about not being able to breathe and finding breath again. He had called it \u201cA Mile of There and Back.\u201d He had looked at his trainers and thought of how they'd moved through nights that would otherwise have been sleepless, nights thick with what-ifs about his dad and regrets and the day he\u2019d allowed a coach to tell him he wasn't enough for a place at Loughborough.\n\nHe didn't know what to make of having done a television thing. Simon had said, interestingly and with less of the arched eyebrow than usual, that he'd never seen a runner who made the stage look like a city and a track both. Amanda had called it \u201cmodern, in a way,\u201d and someone on the production team had asked him to stay after and talk about lighting for it. He had been voted through to the semis on a knife's edge, then lost out to a choir in coordinated blue, because a choir is what Sundays love.\n\nHe checked his phone only when his mother sighed theatrically. The message was there. It had the subject line with more caps than civilised people use.\n\nRAF, CALL US WHEN YOU CAN. URGENT.\n\nHe looked at the word RAF and at the sender's name, which, to his tired eyes, looked like a misinterpretation of his own name. He wiped his thumb on his shorts, just in case his skin could smudge the meaning.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Maya said, catching the change in his posture.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s from the show,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat show?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe show,\u201d he said, and then he laughed at himself for how he didn't say the name as though it were some old superstition, like not whistling in the house. He pressed the call button. His heart had brought a drum into his chest without consulting him. As it rang, he saw himself, absurdly, reflected in the kettle\u2019s chrome, and he was small and full of steam.\n\n\u201cRafi? Hi, it\u2019s Rosanna from production,\u201d the voice said. Bright, clipped, with a tiredness well hidden but there if your ear was trained for it.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, and tasted salt where the air had cracked his lips.\n\n\u201cCan you talk?\u201d she asked in that way that sounds like a test more than a question.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he repeated. He glanced at his mother, who had put down her spoon and was leaning into the phone from across the room as if proximity could translate into understanding.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be bringing you back,\u201d Rosanna said. \u201cFor the final. There's been discussion, you know, lively, about wildcards. We wanted the ideas to be broader this year, not just singing and the usual, and your piece caught fire online after your semi-final. Not to make your head explode, but two million views and a lot of comments about the way you\u2014\u201d she paused, possibly looking for a word that wasn't \u201clooked sweaty.\u201d \u201cThe way you told a story. We would love you to come back.\u201d\n\nThe kettle had boiled, then the click of it suddenly was like a punctuation mark he wanted to underline. Rafi did not speak right away. He had made himself a rule when he was younger: never believe good news on the first read. It was born of counting times that initial elation had gone the way of sugar in tea, gone grain by grain with stirring.\n\n\u201cFor the final,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYes. We know it\u2019s short notice. There\u2019s a wrinkle: we'll need you to work on a version that suits the live finale stage\u2014 bigger, different shapes, fire regulations, you know. We can help you with the design. But\u2014\u201d she must have heard something in the silence \u201c\u2014if you're worried about what's involved, we can walk it through. We'd like to lock this by this evening.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mum\u2019s listening,\u201d he said, and regretted it immediately like a child who confesses to a teacher that his mother is in the audience.\n\n\u201cSay hi to Mum,\u201d Rosanna said, unfazed. \u201cCongratulations. Everyone in our office is really excited to have you. And, Rafi? There's another bit. The union can handle a per diem, and we'll put you up. Do you have a manager, anyone we should be liaising with?\u201d\n\nHe laughed. It came out unexpectedly high. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNo manager. Just me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay. I'll send a contract and a schedule. I have to jump, but call me when you've read it. Welcome back.\u201d\n\nThey went through the usual phone polite and then he hung up and looked at his mother. Her hands had gone to her mouth even though she did not yet know what to say. She came up out of her chair faster than Rafi had seen her move in weeks.\n\n\u201cThe final,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want me.\u201d\n\nShe hugged him. She smelled of soap and the faintest shadow of perfume she had worn in 1992. He held her as if, somehow, he was keeping the piece of good news from blowing out the open window.\n\nWhen his father called, as if some secret village telegraph had rung him, Rafi had to leave the room because the kitchen could not hold both that voice and his own surprise. He took his phone into the hallway where the floorboards had curves like someone had stored waves there. \u201cKid,\u201d his father said, a name he used regardless of age. \u201cAmanda Holden will be talking about our name.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a show,\u201d Rafi said, which was what he was meant to say. It is never just a show. His father had an almost religious belief in the power of British television to hand out miracles once a week. People were always winning money or proposing to each other or finding a lost cousin in a cupboard. \u201cI still have to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we will be watching,\u201d his father said. \u201cYour aunty in Luton already knows. Don't ask how.\u201d\n\nWhen he went to work at the shop, he told no one. In the mirror of the staff toilet he tried to practice the shrug he would use when people asked. He couldn't get it right. His own face kept giving him away. He stacked shelves of cereal with an earnestness his boss, Vince, called \"religious\", and he forgot the prices of things he'd known for months, and at one point he lined up six jam jars in a row like trophies.\n\nIn the afternoon, Leah came in. He had known she would. They had a text language of ellipses and gifs that said more than calling did. She was wearing the red beanie that made her look like a cartoon burglar. She was carrying her bike helmet in her left hand and two croissants in her right, as if she had crashed a French breakfast.\n\n\u201cYou're famous,\u201d she whispered across the fruit aisle, but the whisper turned cartwheely.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said, but smiling.\n\n\u201cFinal,\u201d she said. \u201cFinal. Do you know what that means? We have to make a thing. We have to go big. Are you going to jump off a car? Can you do that? No, that's not legal. What if we played with the light more? That first bit where your shadow looks like it leaves you\u2014\u201d\n\nHe put a finger to his lips. \u201cI'm in a shop,\u201d he said to remind her, as if the stacks of tins weren't evidence enough. \u201cDon't get me fired on the day this happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cVince will forgive you,\u201d she said, and then Vince materialised with a trolley and said, \u201cForgive him for what?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Rafi said, and dropped a packet of spaghetti that then exploded into its life in the aisle.\n\n\u201cNothing?\u201d Vince said, sweeping a hand over the mess in a generous imitation of an Italian man in films. \u201cThis spaghetti survived a factory and a lorry and one very bored teenager lifting it, and you, Rafi, have defeated it.\u201d\n\nLeah snorted into her croissant. \u201cI\u2019m going to cry,\u201d she said, which made Vince blink twice as if he had stumbled into a theatre he hadn\u2019t paid for. She turned toward the door, then back again. She caught Rafi's eye and mouthed: tonight? The videos? He nodded. She raised her croissant like a baton, then left in a gust of cool air and tiny flakes of pastry that were too light to get in trouble.\n\nRosanna's email arrived at four. He read it on his phone in the stockroom, perched on a crate of toilet rolls like a scholar reading a letter from a long-dead poet. The schedule was both a military operation and a suggestion. Rehearsal slots. Camera rehearsals. A health and safety session which, he noted, was bolded. A meal plan. He liked to cook his own, he always had, but there was a line item that read: canteen access available, dietary requirements to be logged, contact Yvonne. The contract was in PDF. He downloaded it and saw his name spelled correctly four times and once as Rafl. He forgave them. He sent it to Leah. He sent it to his father, who replied with eight clapping hands, four fire emojis, then \u201cwhat does this part mean,\u201d beneath a clause about exclusivity periods.\n\nWhen his shift ended, he walked home slower than he had run that morning. The light was yellow and then it remembered winter was not yet done and went grey again. He could feel the house pulling him like a magnet. He liked to arrive at his kitchen with sweat and leave it to his mother to make a small fuss; he liked to be someone's good thing at the end of a day. He would be away now. He thought of his mother folding him into a large city in her quiet mind and trying not to worry.\n\nThey ate dinner at the narrow table; he cooked. He made dal with the lentils his aunt had sent from Pakistan because she believed England did not grow proper lentils. He made rice and added cardamom pods he\u2019d learned, only last year, change everything. He chopped spinach and let it sag into the pan with the slowly contented sound of something coming to itself. His mother set the plates with that mixture of ceremony and practicality she inherited from her own mother: you feed someone as if the day has been hard. She listened to him talk about the schedule and asked questions for the sake of having him tell her everything twice.\n\n\u201cYou'll have to eat,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI always eat,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou'll have to be careful,\u201d she added, looking at him in that layered way that mothers look\u2014 seeing his future, seeing his earlier baby self and the teenager who refused to drink milk for a year. \u201cRemember Manchester? That girl's chicken salad?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was tuna,\u201d he said. It had not been tuna. He had eaten something and had been sick for thirty hours and had promised himself sternly that he would never leave himself at the mercy of a backstage canteen again, that he would bring jars and Tupperware and utensils. He had a tiny stove he took when he travelled, the kind backpackers use. He had felt ridiculous the first time he'd boiled rice in a hotel room mug, then utterly vindicated when the others had eaten grey pasta at midnight and regretted living at three.\n\n\u201cI'll be careful,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter dinner, Leah came with her laptop and their rehearsal footage. Their rehearsal space was the allotment car park after dark. That was the truth of it. He had learned to imagine the chalk lines on the asphalt into a stage. He had taught his body to believe in invisible walls. Leah filmed with a steady hand. They watched the clips and stopped them where his foot had landed early or where the cut gave the wrong angle to the move where he vaulted and let the audience think he would not make the second step but then did.\n\n\u201cThere,\u201d Leah said and tapped the screen. \u201cThat. Keep that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u201d was small. It was the way his shoulders softened and then rolled forward before he pivoted, like a secret door in a crowded room. He had not known it would play like that until he saw it now. He tried to pretend not to smile, failed, then smiled at his failure and the room warmed.\n\n\u201cBig stage,\u201d Leah said. \u201cYou could put a ladder that rises, like it shouldn't, in a way. Or people. Two people, moving obstacles. That will be the trick: get the audience to feel the panic of lanes closing and then the relief when you find the line.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople get hurt.\u201d He wanted to say: I get hurt. He wanted to say: I always have to make sure no one else gets hurt in my stories because sometimes people in my life did. The thought made him glance at the photo on the windowsill, his father with his hand on Rafi's shoulder the day of the tiny school race he had won. His father had shouted \u201cgo\u201d louder than the starting gun.\n\n\u201cIf we manage it, nothing bad happens,\u201d Leah said, as if it were both a guarantee and a prayer.\n\nShe sketched on a pad, not to scale, boxes and arrows. \u201cWe can fake ten times. Do we know where this is? The final stage.\u201d\n\n\u201cHammersmith, I think,\u201d he said. \u201cOr the new place they use now. Rosanna said shape different.\u201d\n\n\u201cShape different,\u201d Leah repeated, and wrote it down like it was an instruction from a deity.\n\nHe answered his phone twice that evening, both times to producers. One was Yvonne from canteen who said, \u201cAllergies?\u201d and he heard her typing, the sound like rain in quality. He told her he wasn't allergic but liked to avoid anything new on performance days, like restaurants you don't know that still have warm seats from the last person. There was another man, Mike, who asked about footwear because apparently a pyrotechnics team was involved in something backstage and certain plastics were a no. He said \u201ctrainers\u201d and the man said \u201cbrand?\u201d and he said it and the man hummed in a way that suggested pleasing an unseen insurance company.\n\nHe packed late. He put his good things in a bag that had been to hostels and once to a strange party where he had borrowed someone's coat to feel like he belonged. He folded like a person trying to fold a future into cotton. He took oats, a small jar of ghee his mother swore by, tea bags because every tea office except theirs brewed too weak, and the tiny stove. He put in a headtorch because he was someone who put headtorches in things. He took the photo of his father and him, even though he wasn't that person, then took it out again because he didn\u2019t want to be that person.\n\nHe went to bed and could not sleep. He lay with the ceiling close enough to touch and thought of that first time he had run. Not the first time he moved quickly as a child, which had just been a blur of knees. The first time he made it a thing with numbers and intention and a finish line. He had left the house after dinner and run to the end of the road and then to the bridge and then further because the body loves being asked to do a bit more than last time. He had returned with his lungs like bells and had told no one because he didn't know that sharing it would be safe. Over time, he had found people to share with. Leah. His mum, with her delicate questions. A coach who had told him on a Tuesday in November that he could try for a university spot if he could find a second and a half. He had not found that second and a half. He had found, instead, people on a TV show asking him to do something stranger: to make the distance inside his mind visible to a crowd.\n\nHe fell asleep in the last hour before his alarm, and when it pulled him up, he felt like he had been dragged by his ankles from a river. He made coffee strong enough to make the kitchen smell like a memory of a place with sun. He sat with Maya and they did the crossword with their usual division of labour: he did the long answers and she filled the small boxes with surprising words. She worried over his train. He told her, not unkindly, that he was a grown man. She said, not unkindly, \u201cYou have never been a grown man to me,\u201d and he stood and gathered his bag and hugged her again at the doorway, a hug that lasted a fraction too long for comfort and exactly as long as they both needed.\n\nOn the train to London, he found a seat by the window. The river ran alongside for a while, pretending to be lazy. He thought about the city as a place with too many rooms where decisions were made. He had a notebook open on his lap, pen ready. He wrote: shape different. He wrote: a ladder that rises like a secret. He wrote: a moment where the audience thinks I'm finished and I am not. He wrote, then he crossed it out: do not fall. And then, because he had learned from experience that he had to be polite to fear, he wrote underneath it: you can fall and get back up if you need. He wrote his mother's name. He wrote the word \u201cBrampton\u201d as if he had to make sure it would still exist when he returned.\n\nThe studio was a warehouse that had been reborn as a cathedral of light. As he entered, he could see the weight of the ceiling and the anxiety of the walls. There were signs everywhere: STAGE THIS WAY, FOGGER ON, QUIET ZONE. There were people wearing headsets who moved as if the traffic of their ears was more important than the actual floor. He saw the paper with his name on it, taped to a door that led to a room where a kettle waited and a sofa that had seen better upholstery but still wanted to be kind. Someone had printed the paper too small. He loved them for that. He pinned it, this tiny error, as something to touch later when the minutes grew long. He put his bag down like he was checking in a memory with a cloakroom attendant.\n\nRosanna found him. She had hair that refused to be pinned tidy, which gave him comfort. \u201cThere you are,\u201d she said. \u201cHome safe?\u201d\n\nHe didn't know if she meant the room or London or television. \u201cYes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe'll walk to stage in a moment,\u201d she said. \u201cNot to terrify you, but it's a beast. You'll want your footing. We've had three people slip this week and one break a heel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not wearing heels,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cShame,\u201d she said, and he liked her in that moment more than he had on the phone. \u201cFood is down the corridor. Yvonne is a saint with a clipboard. She has your details. We\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d\n\nShe said we'll keep you safe as if it meant both physical and the other kind, the kind the old producers know about, the kind where you don't get eaten by attention. He appreciated that, or maybe he just needed to hear it and so he heard it.\n\nHe met the other acts in glances and fragments. A magician whose hands shook when he wasn't performing and became stone when he was. A fourteen-year-old singer whose mother was every inch of a mother you\u2019ve seen in television shows about mothers. A comedian who shook his hand with too much grip, registered his lack of white trousers as a personal affront, and then told him he loved his work. A dog. There is always a dog. He met a violinist who practised scales in a corner until the room tasted of resin. He tried to look like someone who belonged with them and also like someone who could leave at any moment, which is a strange posture.\n\nYvonne did have a clipboard. She ticked when he said his name and nodded when he said \u201cno allergies\u201d in a manner that implied she had heard everything. She promised him rice and chicken not complicated and warned that on show night the canteen turned into a war zone with napkins. He told her he had his own food for the day. She shrugged and said, with the cool of a ship's cook who'd seen storms swallow lesser men, \u201cSuit yourself, love.\u201d\n\nRosanna took him to the stage. The path to it was a river of cable and gaffer tape. The last corner turned and there it was: a skeleton under light. Bigger than the allotment car park. Bigger than his idea of what the body could own. The set was black and then not black where the lights tested their colours. The floor had marks like a map\u2014 Xs and arrows and circles that meant something to someone. The judges' desk was in the distance like the prow of ship. The audience's stands were empty now and still had a hungering silence, as if people had left their breath in their seats.\n\nHe stepped onto the floor slowly because this was the kind of place you didn't rush. He walked it with Rosanna, who pointed at places and said, \u201ccamera here,\u201d and \u201cwe'll have a runner\u2014 a stage runner, not you\u2014 bring this piece on,\u201d and \u201cthe pyro is behind that. Don't go back there unless dressed in metal.\u201d He learned the distances. He measured in strides, then in seconds. He felt, oddly, that he could feel the ghosts of other acts in the floor. A million small scuffs. He bent and touched it with the back of his hand like a superstitious footballer, then stood quickly in case anyone had seen.\n\n\u201cBreathe,\u201d Rosanna said, which he only then realised he had not been doing properly.\n\nHe thought of Leah, who would be practicing with tea on his mother's table, running her finger along the sketches. He thought of the terrier on the embankment and the old man's hand lifting and whatever home meant, exactly, when the world was this wide and askew.\n\n\u201cThere's a media session,\u201d Rosanna said, checking her phone for the time.\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say anything you'd be embarrassed to read on the front of the paper tomorrow.\u201d\n\nHe smiled. \u201cI don't say anything,\u201d he said, and she laughed, then said, \u201cYes. That.\u201d\n\nHe rehearsed until the lights grew less foreign. He set his boxes where they were allowed. His body learned the space like a new language. The first few runs were clumsy. He corrected. He corrected again. He surprised himself with a jump he had not planned and Leah wasn't there to tell him if it worked on camera, so he imagined her saying \u201cthere\u201d and kept it. Midway through, he felt that light, specific ache that meant he was building something in the air. He could see the piece in his head, that imaginary line that connects beginning to end. He could feel where he wanted to break it and then heal it as the music did the same.\n\nA boy in black trousers brought him water and said, \u201cBig fan,\u201d and blushed to his ears after he'd said it, and Rafi wanted to say something wise but only managed, \u201cThanks.\u201d He drank like he had always been thirsty.\n\nHe checked his bag in the room again, then went to find Leah in his phone. He sent her a photo of the stage and the words: shape very different. She replied with a photo of their kitchen, with the caption: empire central. His mother had added sambal to waiting bowls. They would not let him starve. He smiled and the soundstage turned a fraction less cold. He had not then, not yet, learned the way a place can change its face when the lights are up and the people arrive and the clock is ticking toward live. He did not know yet about the canteen as a village, the corners where whispers go to reproduce, the eyes that follow, the mouths that say good luck and mean a little less than the words. He did not know yet about the lunch. He did not know yet the weight of a twist of the gut at the wrong time, or the relief of being told this is your mark by someone who believes in you, or how thin the air is at the top of something you have wanted for years.\n\nFor now, the room with his name too small on its door was still his. The boxes were still just boxes. He called his mother and listened to her tell him to tie his laces properly, even though he had long changed to a different kind of shoe that didn't tie anymore. He let her fuss. He could be large later. Here, now, in the unglamorous minute before things began, he could be the boy who had returned with wet hair and worn socks and found, on a table, a bowl of hot dal and a spoon and someone to say, Sit, tell me how far you went. He could be, fully, a person not yet seen by a million pairs of eyes. He could love the emptiness of the seats and promise them gently that he would be worth filling.\n\nNight came earlier in that warehouse. The sky outside did what skies do. Inside, the lights took over. Yvonne's stews warmed the air in ordinary ways. Somewhere a dog barked the bark of a star. Somewhere a producer sighed in a way that meant a camera had gone wrong. Rafi laced and unlaced his shoes for no reason. He walked the corridors that looped back on themselves like thought. He passed the canteen twice and waved to the man with the tattoo of a rose that peered from his collar like a witness. He promised himself he would not eat anything he didn't trust. He promised himself he would be ferocious and gentle in equal measure. He promised himself he would remember to look up, find a face in the crowd, and then the next and the next. He promised before he had to break anything, or fix it, or be broken himself. He promised, and the building held him to it.Chapter 2\n\nHe woke with the city already pressing its breath against the window. The hotel was the kind that wrapped you in beige in the name of calm and gave you a view of the backside of another hotel, which felt both comic and appropriate. He lay still and listened to the hum of the corridor and the odd, small noises that happen when a building full of strangers puts on its day\u2014showers finding hot, doors kissed closed with the soft violence of the chain catch, a room-service trolley going about its pastoral duty. He missed the way Brampton had a silence that wasn't empty but was filled with things that minded their business. He pulled on his kit and went to run anyway, because the map inside him demanded it.\n\nOutside, the city offered him a canal in lieu of a river, and men in fluorescent jackets launching their mornings on little barges of chores. He took a path that slid past graffiti that read like secret advice, past a cluster of ducks who eyed him with the long memory of creatures who know humans are erratic, past runners who nodded and gave him the fellowship of the early. He counted lampposts as always and felt, not for the first time, that the rhythm he made on pavement could be a sincere answer to a question he had never quite managed to ask out loud. On the way back he stopped on a footbridge and looked down at a bicycle submerged just under the water, its wheels catching the light indecently, and thought of all the things people throw away and all the ways they get caught, beautiful for a second in their ruin.\n\nThe studio smelt of coffee and freshly opened gaffer tape. A man in a high-vis vest with a crisp sense of purpose frog-marched a crate of cables across his line and nodded at Rafi like they were both in on a secret that involved electricity. In a conference room that had been dressed with a bowl of fruit as if that could distract from its windowlessness, the health and safety briefing gathered them in and told stories about burns and bruises with the rhythm of someone who had seen them all. A slide of a foot with a melted sole made someone gasp. Rafi took notes because taking notes was a way to carry luck in your pocket, and because the man had the farmer\u2019s gift of turning warnings into parables. Fog machines were friendly if you knew their names. Pyro didn\u2019t care that your mum was watching. Everything had a wake and you had to learn to live in it.\n\nFlo, the stage manager, found him in the corridor and put a roll of tape in his hand like a priest pressing a rosary onto a sinner at the door. \u201cYour lane,\u201d she said, and it sounded like a benediction. She was compact and brisk and had the kind of laugh that used too few syllables and still felt like a gift. She showed him the marks that were his. She told him where the camera would be when he was meant to look at it, even though he had explained he didn\u2019t really look at cameras, he looked at somewhere above them where his courage seemed to sit. She walked him through a plan to get his boxes on and off without creating a traffic problem. She had a list attached to her list and he loved her for that immediately.\n\n\u201cMedia next,\u201d Rosanna said, appearing from nowhere the way producers do when the schedule threatened to slip down the back of the sofa. \u201cAt the press lunch. You\u2019ll be fine. Smile, breathe, say the thing you want to say and not the thing they suggest, and if somebody tries to turn your life into a one-sentence caption, step over it.\u201d\n\n\u201cA press lunch?\u201d he said. He had imagined three people in a corner with branded pop-up banners and a woman with an iPad. Lunch made it sound like there would be cutlery and opinions that wore linen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s sandwiches with microphones. You\u2019ll be grand,\u201d she said, and he trusted her and did not trust her in equal measure because that was how these things worked.\n\nHe messaged Leah and told her when they wanted him. She replied with a photo of a hand-drawn ladder with a speech bubble that read, come on then, rise. She was getting the midday train. He felt a childish relief at the thought of her voice inside these walls. He packed his little tiffin of rice and dal into his bag even though he had now been told there would be food. He wanted to sit at a table with his own cooking like a pilgrim disobedient to a temple and watch people try not to stare at the fact that his lunch had orange on the outside and a smell like all the kitchens he trusted.\n\nThe press area was a rectangle borrowed from a different building, which meant it had the wrong carpet. Someone had thrown ferns at it to help, and a lighting rig pretended to be a skylight. Long tables were laid as if fifteen weddings were about to happen at once. Journalists had the look of people who had already written half of what they would say and were just waiting to plug in quotes like plug sockets. He took a seat between the magician and the violinist. The magician had changed his tie three times in the previous hour and now had one that looked like a piano on a good day. The violinist had put resin on her fingertips by accident and now they shone, which made her hands look like they were lit from the inside.\n\n\u201cPress,\u201d the magician mouthed, and made the kind of smile you make when someone tells you an exam will be easy if you don\u2019t think about it too hard. The first person to reach them had hair the colour of a strawberry that had won a fight and a notebook with hearts on the edges that had been drawn long ago and contaminated many interviews since. She looked at Rafi\u2019s containers because they were not the sandwiches, then at his face, then at her list. \u201cRafi,\u201d she said, steadying herself. \u201cWe loved your semi-final. You turned running into poetry. How does that feel? And, you know, being brown and everything. Representation.\u201d\n\nHe had prepared to talk about pace and pain and the little altar you plant in your chest when you go for a time. He had not prepared to have his skin announced as if it had bought a ticket. He found his mouth choosing a sentence that would not shame either of them. \u201cIt feels like the body\u2019s another language,\u201d he said. \u201cRepresentation is lovely, but I\u2019m not a flag. I\u2019m a person who moves.\u201d\n\nThe violinist\u2019s head tipped at that like a small bird hearing a note it liked. The journalist made a series of ticks that sounded like she was counting something other than words. \u201cVery good,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd your mum. She\u2019s important to you?\u201d\n\nHe laughed because that was the safest thing to do when someone put your mum on a plate like a biscuit. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s my first audience.\u201d\n\nThere were other questions from other corners. One man asked him whether he thought Britain was ready for \u201calternative physical theatre,\u201d pronouncing each word as if it had to audition for its own syllables. Someone else wondered if he had ever been bullied, and when he told the truth\u2014only the usual kind and even then he had had friends who made jokes with him, not at him\u2014she looked mildly disappointed. A woman with a tattoo of a swallow just inside her wrist asked him what trainers he wore and then, without any transition that made narrative sense, whether he thought footballers were overpaid. He held tight to his resolve to be kind and useful and when he was not sure he was achieving either, he pretended to be a person who had been told to talk slowly.\n\nMidway, a man with a piece of laminated lanyard armour that had more colours than necessary introduced himself as a \u201cbrand liaison\u201d and sat down as if he had always known Rafi. He said words like synergy with a straight face. He showed him a little sachet of neon gel as if presenting a sacrament and suggested it might be a nice moment, on camera, if Rafi \u201cfuelled\u201d just before he went on. Rafi thought about how his stomach did not like strangers and how he had already promised not to put anything new into his system today. He thought of the time he had eaten a pastelito in a Buenos Aires youth hostel because everyone else was eating them and spent the night talking intimately to a sink. He smiled and said, \u201cI have my own routine. Thank you.\u201d The man frowned as if Rafi had defied a calendar. Yvonne, watching from the serving station with arms folded and the grin of someone who enjoyed being underestimated, said, \u201cNot today, sweetness,\u201d in a way that placed a protective arm around him without touching him. The man moved his campaign elsewhere, and Rafi loved Yvonne more than was reasonable for someone he had known for twenty-six minutes.\n\nHe sat on the edge of the canteen\u2019s noise and ate his food with the careful speed of a person in a buffet wars environment. The magician could not stop doing tricks, which meant his soup kept jumping without warning. The choir in coordinated blue sang happy birthday to itself, which suited Sundays but felt extravagant on a Wednesday. The comedian tried out a line about the judges and then immediately retracted it as if words could be pulled back like dogs who had gone too far off lead. The fourteen-year-old singer\u2019s mother cut her daughter\u2019s chicken into strict identical squares and lined them up on the plate because order always soothed someone. Rafi felt his gut tighten not with food but with the attention of people who were looking and deciding what he would be to them. He put his spoon down and breathed so his chest would get the message and stop bracing for a sprint.\n\nRosanna pulled him from the corner before he could think himself into knots. \u201cTell me it was painless,\u201d she said, and he said, \u201cIt was a thing. I didn\u2019t bleed,\u201d which was as close to praise as he could get. She had a new brightness in her eye that could only mean an idea. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking,\u201d she said, and the we was the sort that included people in suits and nervous laughter. \u201cAbout bodies in the piece. Two movers. Not dancers, not chorus, just bodies to shift the obstacles in a way that reads more clearly for camera. You don\u2019t have to act with them. They\u2019ll be invisible, essentially, dressed in black. But they can make the lanes close and open so that your path is more dynamic for the wide shot. It gives us coverage. It gives you\u2014\u201d she searched for a word he would like and found one\u2014 \u201cbreath.\u201d\n\nHe felt himself pull away before he could command himself to stay. The entire shape of the thing lived in his forearms and his calves and that place inside the foot where the arch holds a secret. He had built it on the faith that the obstacles were honest and only did what he told them to do. People introduced stripe and error. People tripped and apologised with their whole heads and the apology wasn\u2019t retroactive. He heard the old thud of a memory\u2014his father catching his elbow in a doorway when he was ten, the day they had tried to carry a table without planning it and had taken off one of the skirting boards with a laughter that had a bruise in it. He thought of Leah and the way she had sketched two humans into the plan with arrows.\n\n\u201cLet me try,\u201d he said, surprising himself with the compromise. \u201cLet me try with them and without. If it feels like a trick and not the thing, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\n\nRosanna nodded, relief and calculation trading glances on her face. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing is in stone until we say it is in stone.\u201d Then she checked her phone and said, \u201cLeah\u2019s here. She has a rucksack that suggests she\u2019s planning to climb a mountain.\u201d\n\nLeah came into the corridor like she had been summoned by the building itself. She had one of those art student rucksacks that had stains from projects and the proud slouch of something useful. She wore a coat meant for rain that had met paint more often. Her grin filled the space beside him the way light fills a jar when you take it near a window. \u201cI am prepared to erect a city,\u201d she said by way of greeting. \u201cHow big is your floor? How many seconds to cross it? How much fog is too much fog?\u201d\n\nHe told her about the lunch and the suggestion and the bodies in black, and her face did a thing he recognised\u2014 worry moving over optimism like cloud over water, then breaking. \u201cIt could be good,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they move in a way that is air, not people. If they are wind. If they are decision. And we keep you alone at the end, because it\u2019s your piece and it must be your last image.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing must,\u201d he said automatically, but he knew what she meant. He knew what must felt like. He had built his mornings around it.\n\nThey rehearsed with two crew from a pool that existed primarily for this kind of question. The men were older than he expected, with knees that told their own stories, and dignity in the way they waited for instruction. They wore the black of people who had been told to be negative space. Flo gave them earpieces and quickly labelled them Mover One and Mover Two because names create softness you can\u2019t afford on a schedule. They tried a run. The movers slid boxes on cue and opened a lane two beats later than he wanted and his foot went where a box had been as if it still existed and he had one of those heart-stopping tiny moments where you realise you have placed your body on faith. He recovered. He lied to his breath about how fast it should come. Next time they made the timing, and when they did, it felt like the floor had learned a trick he had not taught it.\n\nHe began to see how it might work. The box that would be a wall. The alley that would become a room. The ladder that might lift on the kind of stage magic that made him feel simultaneously delighted and annoyed because he did not believe things should rise unless they had earned the right with effort. Leah stood where the main camera would be and told him where he looked like a man fighting and where he looked like a man dancing, and he filed that away for the moment where he needed the latter and felt too much like the former.\n\nOn the third run he slid on a streak of something that was not supposed to be there. He caught himself with a hand to the floor and his knee jolted in a manner that made his stomach clench with the ancient memory of gym halls and iced packs and the counsel of people who begin sentences with \u201cyou\u2019ll never.\u201d He sat back and breathed into the joint like breath could bring calm. Flo arrived at a trot with a cloth and a look that could have stripped varnish. \u201cI told them to keep the confetti hell off this floor,\u201d she said, scouring. \u201cAre you good?\u201d\n\nHe was honest because honesty was quicker than bravado in rooms like this. \u201cI jarred it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not broken. It\u2019s telling me it exists.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cWe like existence. Don\u2019t fall on live, yeah?\u201d Her tone made it a punchline and an instruction both, and he found himself smiling because he realised he was surrounded by people whose job was to keep his hubris and his ankles from doing anything foolish.\n\nHe took a break because there was no valor in pretending the knee was not speaking. Leah sat with him on the base of a fly tower and examined the camera feed. \u201cThere,\u201d she said, pointing to a frame where he lifted and the ladder came and it looked, briefly, as if he had conjured it. \u201cIf we time the light so it finds your foot at exactly that moment, you\u2019ll be the pivot.\u201d\n\n\u201cFlo said they can give us a white from above,\u201d he said. \u201cOne clean white and let the rest go blue. We\u2019ll throw shadow like a second body. It might be the thing people remember.\u201d\n\nLeah put her head on his shoulder the way she did when he had done something that justified her faith, and he let the shape of that compliment settle. He had the thought, quick and disloyal to all the ways he wanted not to want, that he could be the kind of person who made room for this woman in the middle of the noise. He didn\u2019t say it. He had learned not to say things in rooms where the air had microphones even when you couldn\u2019t see them.\n\nThe afternoon was a river he stepped into and forgot the bank. They worked. They tried a version with a beat\u2019s silence before the ladder, and a version where the silence grew to two beats and felt pretentious, and a version where one of the movers breathed an audible \u201csorry\u201d when he misheard a cue and apologised for an art no one would be able to read. He ate the banana Yvonne abandoned on a plate near his elbow like a blessing and felt nothing of the intestinal terror he had promised himself he would avoid. The stomach twist did not come with food but with a notification. It was his father, who had discovered an article online that had turned his press lunch into a wind-up toy.\n\nRunner says show saved him, the headline read, and the photo did that thing where it froze him half-lidded and gave him the look of a man who had not slept but had been instructed to look delighted anyway. The piece quoted him out of himself. It had him saying that without this chance he \u201cdidn\u2019t know where I\u2019d be,\u201d which was something humans say when they are trying to be polite about luck and get punished for it, and it made his stomach harden like a fist because he had worked in a shop and made dinners and run in the rain and he was not about to hand himself over to the idea that television had arrived like a saint with a candle. He stood there with the phone hot in his hand and felt the old anger he rarely let have the wheel and then let it go because anger burned fuel he needed for later.\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Leah asked, because she could read a screen from the cast of a jaw. He showed her. She grunted in a register that could have knocked a wall down if it had been a little louder. \u201cThey will say what they want,\u201d she said. \u201cWe say what we say, and the piece says what it says. Don\u2019t feed it. Make them film the truth instead.\u201d\n\nHe put the phone away like a thing that bit. He finished the rehearsal and found, by the time evening folded over the warehouse again, that the floor had given him a gift. The moment he had written in his notebook\u2014where the audience would think he was done and he was not\u2014had begun to exist. He found the beat where he stopped, the music went thin, the lights favoured the wrong place, and then he stepped where apparently there was nothing and a ladder rose as if the floor still wanted him. He let the move be smaller than the instinct demanded, and that made it better. Flo clapped once, sharp, a conductor finding the exact bar. Rosanna exhaled in a way that meant this was what they could sell. Even the technician with the rose tattoo, who had seen more than he let on, said, \u201cNice, mate,\u201d like a reward to a dog for a trick that had been discouraging for months.\n\nHe wrote to his mother on the walk to the hotel because he knew she would time her worry to his footsteps. He told her he had eaten, he had not fallen, the people were kind, and he used none of the bigger sentences he wanted to use because he did not know how to put television-warmed rooms and ladders into a phone message that would arrive in a house that preferred the quiet truth of a kettle. His father called and spoke too loudly as if his voice had to fill the distance with decibels, and told him without preamble that the corner shop had stuck his face on the cigarette display because they were bored and wanted something to laugh at. His aunt from Luton sent a voice note that included six different ways of saying well done and one recipe for a lentil soup that would keep grief out of your bones. He promised nothing and everything, which is what you do when people love you.\n\nIn the hotel corridor, a thin violin found him. The violinist sat cross-legged outside her own door because maybe her roommate was sleeping and lay the instrument across her knees as if it were a small animal she was coaxing into life. He sat opposite, back against the wall like a teenager. She played scales that rose like ladders and then fell again. \u201cDo you get scared?\u201d he asked when the phrase ran out of breath.\n\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d she said, wiping the bow. \u201cI like it. It means I\u2019m alive.\u201d\n\nHe thought about running as fear\u2019s twin and smiled. He thought about a coach he had had who had once spoken of fear like it was a demon you could starve. He knew now that you didn\u2019t starve fear. You fed it small, measured things and kept your own plate full. When he got back into his room he found a message from that very coach, forwarded and forwarded until it had lost its provenance, a link to the article with the offending headline, and the words: proud of you, keep your head, always believed. He sat with the complicated gift of that for a moment\u2014how praise can arrive carrying the ghost of past disappointments and still be useful. He put the phone face down and let the city hands outside his window keep doing whatever they were doing without him.\n\nAt a late hour when the corridors emptied and the carpet forgot the day\u2019s footsteps, he took the lift down to the canteen because Yvonne had promised to put aside something \u201cwith sense in it\u201d for him. She had done it\u2014rice, a stew that had been allowed to know what it was, a yoghurt that had not been bullied into sweetness. She sat on a stool, shoes off, and told him she had once almost fed a pop star a nut by mistake and been saved by a junior runner with an eye like a hawk. She told him tomorrow\u2019s lunch would be busier because the Saturday magazines came to get their human interest, and advised him not to make jokes about judges, politics or the weather turning because apparently every meteorologist in the land took it personally. He thanked her and she said, with no fuss, \u201cJust win your bit. The rest takes care of itself,\u201d and he wished he believed that more than he did.\n\nHe slept the kind of sleep that has skirts, a handful of minutes at a time, each one wary of the next. His knee hummed and stilled, hummed and stilled. He woke before his alarm because his mind had already put on its shoes. He ran a small loop in streets that looked like themselves only after eight, then returned to the studio because there was nowhere else to go that could hold the energy he had wound up. He walked the empty seats and said hello to them in his head like a host preparing for a party, told the sixth row they would laugh, told the balcony it would get its own private performance when he looked up. He found the ladder and touched one of its rungs as a foolish lover might touch a doorpost and immediately stepped back because you don\u2019t give inanimate objects that much control. He taped his laces down though his shoes did not need it. He put a small pebble from the Ouse on the floor beside his starting mark and Flo carefully moved it later with two fingers and a nod, which meant it was now a prop with paperwork.\n\nThe press lunch grew itself from nowhere in a sudden blooming of napkins and cameras. He felt prepared and not, which was his usual state. He chose a seat near the edge and found that his choice of edge did not matter because edges were illusions at events where everyone was invited to lean. The first question this time came from a woman who spoke softly and wrote quickly. She asked him who had taught him to run. He could have said no one and everyone and the body and hunger and the day he had not known what to do with himself at sixteen. He said his father, because it was partly true and because the words put something warm into the room. The follow-up was about his dad\u2019s absence from Manchester. He explained a rota of work and distance and sanity and she nodded like she understood, and he felt grateful because understanding was a rare currency.\n\nWhen he returned to the floor after, his stomach had that twist in it that comes when you have been seen and not entirely in the way you would have chosen, and he did the only thing he knew to do with that feeling. He ran the piece. He ran it twice and then again. He ran it like a man reminding himself what belongs to him regardless of who is looking. He found the breath inside it that Rosanna had promised and the wind that Leah had asked for and the quiet moment that would mean everything in a room designed to overtalk. He jumped and did not fall. He looked up the way he had promised and found faces that were not there yet and rehearsed the nod he would give to them. He shaped the movement so that even people who thought they hated running might love watching him try to turn leaving and returning into something they could feel in their own legs.\n\nHe did not know what the cameras would decide he meant. He did not know what the show would edit him into. He knew what his body was for. He knew what the floor could hold. He knew the exact number of steps from the mark to the place where the ladder would lift and he would look, for a heartbeat, like a person who had summoned something from nowhere and it had obeyed. He let that be enough until the door of the day opened again and everything he had promised himself to be began to be tested.Chapter 4\n\nHe came home with London still stuck to his skin like a second weather. The train had delivered him into the geography that made sense, the one with hedges that had arguments with themselves and a sky that kept staring as if it had known him since he was small. The village was doing what villages do on a Monday after someone from there has been on the telly: pretending it hadn\u2019t noticed and then noticing in a surge at the butcher\u2019s, or outside the post office, or in the way a window\u2019s curtain twitched like a blink. He stood in his own hallway with its damp wool smell, put his bag down exactly where it always bruised the skirting board, and breathed as if breath was a thing you had to practise after days of being watched.\n\nHe ran before he had a chance to think better of it. The cold had sharpened while he was away, the air brushing his teeth from the inside. The Ouse had its shoulders up as if it too had felt, in some reptile part of its current, the weight of lights miles away. He found the path as if it had been sleeping with one eye open for him and now wanted a report. His knee told him, oh yes, hello, we remember, and then settled under the familiar bargain of warmth. The old man with the terrier appeared where he always appeared, conjured by habit and the smell of wet earth. They did not nod this time. The man lifted his chin and spoke the way you speak when you\u2019ve been rehearsing lines for weeks. \u201cSaw you,\u201d he said. \u201cSaw you jump. Good, that.\u201d\n\nRafi wanted to say that he had not so much jumped as negotiated with gravity and paperwork. He said, \u201cThank you,\u201d and the terrier, whose eyes had known sorrow and left a little room for joy despite it, gave a bark that sounded like agreement. \u201cName\u2019s Jim,\u201d the man added, which felt like a medal more than a name. \u201cDog\u2019s Mavis. Don\u2019t laugh.\u201d Rafi didn\u2019t. He ran on with Mavis\u2019s bark making a neat knot at the end of his last sentence.\n\nOn the way back he let his stride lengthen as if he were opening a book too quickly and then forced it smaller because speed had nowhere to be today. He stopped where the once-started hedge still made a promise to the future and couldn\u2019t quite keep it. He touched the scar on his gums with his tongue out of habit. He considered the map of his village anew. There would have to be a new mark now: here, the place where he had thought, after the final, sitting on a dressing-room sofa with glitter sticking to his forearms like a broken galaxy, that relief felt like a betrayal. He had not won. He knew that saying it like that made it sound heavy and it was not quite heavy, it was a stone he could put in his pocket and forget until he reached in for keys. The dog had won, in the end, which was a sentence you can say about many British evenings. The choir had sung as if the roof would be kind. The magician had turned his hands into a church and still lost, which he had expected and not expected. The fourteen-year-old had been brilliant in the way fourteen-year-olds are brilliant\u2014pure and unarmoured and completely unprepared for what morning papers can do. He had stood under falling confetti cut in the shapes of stars that did not look like any stars he trusted, and smiled until his face asked to clock off.\n\nIf you had asked him for an image of his own performance, he would have given you the moment he had expected to go to sleep over and over in the night and never did: the quiet, the lights looking the wrong way on purpose, the breath coming like a well-behaved animal, and then that small step into somewhere that decided to be there exactly when he needed it. The ladder rose. The room made a sound it did on its own, a collective intake that turned ribs into instruments. He had not fallen. The knee had held. Mover One and Mover Two had moved like the idea of air. Flo had been a metronome with a voice. Rosanna had squeezed his shoulder and said \u201cyes\u201d not about television, but about the fact that someone had asked for a difficult thing and he had brought it. Amanda had found her word again and called it modern. Simon had tried to pretend he was immune to surprise and had failed in the half-second you cannot control. The cameras had caught one angle he had not wanted them to and three that he knew would make strangers think of their own breath. He found in the minutes after that he could stand being congratulated if he arranged the compliments in a line like shoes at a door and did not pick any of them up.\n\n\u201cTea,\u201d Maya said, already halfway to the kettle because she believed more devoutly than any saint in the doctrine of hot water. She had watched from the sofa with a cushion on her lap as if it could have protected him if the ladder had misbehaved. Her eyes were red in a way he recognised from colds and from weddings. She pressed her hand to his cheek now and then, as if the television had been a cold room and she needed to make sure he\u2019d warmed through again. \u201cYour father,\u201d she added, and did not have to finish because he could guess the list that followed. The calls. The texts. The fact that Rafi\u2019s uncle had filmed his own television with his phone and posted the recording to a WhatsApp group with a pride that had smeared every technical detail until sound and image were cousins but not siblings.\n\nHis father arrived before the cups had finished steaming, as if the distance from where he lived to their door was elastic and television had stretched it. He came in with the air of a man who had delivered a small baby and needed someone to sign for it. \u201cYou,\u201d he said, and then did something Rafi had not seen him do except once when Pakistan had won a cricket match on the last ball\u2014he sat down abruptly and was quiet. The quiet did more than the words. After a time the words caught up. \u201cMy boy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou made them listen without talking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all talking,\u201d Rafi said, because he had learned that moving was reading aloud with different punctuation. His father brushed a crumb from the table like a man mending a roof. \u201cThey will call,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the agents. You tell me. We will choose.\u201d\n\nRafi looked at his mother over the lip of his cup and found in her eyes the thought he was having to swallow. Choose what. Choose between what and what. There were emails already, of course. One from a sportswear brand that used the word icon as if it could be stuck to a person like a sticker. One from a casting director who had the kind of signature that included Latin for no good reason and suggested a role in an advert where he would need to look at a camera like a man who both loved and respected a chocolate bar. One from a school in Peterborough asking if he could come and \u201cinspire\u201d the Year Tens, which he wanted to do more than he wanted to do almost anything because Year Tens needed all the gentle hands you could find. He had the feeling of standing in a meadow at dusk where gnats rise in columns and you do not know which one will end up in your eye.\n\nVince rang from the shop and left a message that began, \u201cAre you alive,\u201d and continued, \u201cPlease come in and be normal; people keep trying to buy spaghetti like they know you now.\u201d Leah texted a photo of the village hall with the caption: imagine. He did. He could see the chalk lines on polished wood. He could see plastic chairs stacked like possibilities along the wall. He could see their ladder against the stage and the way the local light would love it more than any studio could. \u201cWe can build it here,\u201d he said aloud without meaning to. His mother, who had more talent than anyone he knew for hearing things you hadn\u2019t meant to say, nodded like a woman whose faith had been waiting for an altar. \u201cWe can,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have tables.\u201d\n\nThey went shopping because life insists on it. The co-op had arranged itself around him like a stage does around its lead without admitting to it. He tried to move as if he were not something people had opinions about. Vince tried to play it cool and failed by half. He made a little show of not ringing up the honey properly and then looked panicked until Rafi laughed and rescued him with the barcode. \u201cHow was it?\u201d Vince asked, and Rafi considered giving him a paragraph and gave him nine words instead. \u201cBig room. Good people. I didn\u2019t fall. It was loud.\u201d Vince nodded as if these were all the data points one needed to survive fame. A woman he had never seen before touched his sleeve in the drinks aisle and said, \u201cOur boy,\u201d as if she had birthed him in the queue at the post office. He bought more oats than anyone needed and a jar of mango pickle because the labels made him feel like the shelf would keep holding.\n\nAt home, Leah came with her rucksack stuffed to the drawstring lip, and the wind in her hair said she had cycled and almost run. She had watched the final with her landlady and two houseplants and had cried at what he knew she would cry at, which was not the ladder but the small moment he had salted the air with his hands in remembrance of the bits he couldn\u2019t bring with him. She held his face for a beat longer than friends sometimes do and then they got down to the business of making. \u201cWe can do Tuesdays and Thursdays at the hall,\u201d she said, pulling a notebook that looked like a patient from the bag. \u201cThere\u2019s a Tuesday upholstery group but they finish at eight and we can talk them into giving us the last half hour of their session if we can promise not to tread on the foam. Mr. Singh at the hardware will let me borrow two trestles if we bring them back clean. I asked about the ladder. There is one. It is questionable. But we can reinforce. I know a man with screws.\u201d\n\nHe answered emails with the care of a person unscrewing a jammed jar. He wrote to the school and said yes. He wrote to the brand and said thank you, no, unless they wanted to help them tour a piece to small towns and keep ticket prices low, in which case yes, absolutely, talk to him about how. He wrote to the casting director and said there was a voice in him that told him to love chocolate but it was not a face he wanted to show. He wrote to a woman called Saira who had somehow found his email and who ran a community centre in Kettering and said, could you come talk to our lads who never sit still, and he wrote yes so quickly that his fingers caught on the keys. He wrote to Rosanna and told her plainly that the show had not saved him, but the room had been kind and that he would be grateful to the floor for as long as he could remember floors. Rosanna wrote back with a sentence he would keep for a while: The room is a room because people like you come into it.\n\nHe went back to the track two days later because he wanted to see if the old ghosts would still hum. The coach who had told him, once upon a year heavy with numbers, that he would need a second and a half, was there in his cap with the salt stain. The man looked at him and did the British thing with his mouth where he prepared for emotion and then strapped it down and let it out anyway. \u201cI was wrong about you,\u201d he said, and Rafi held up a hand because wrongness about the past was not the flavour of the day he could digest. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were right about that second. I never found it. I found other seconds. They still count.\u201d They ran a little, not because anyone needed to but because the simple act of stepping in rhythm with another person slapped meaning onto the air. The coach, whose name was Lawrence but whom everyone called Lo because the long name didn\u2019t suit him unless you were telling him off, watched his knee the way a doctor watches a test result. \u201cCareful,\u201d he said, not dour, not doom, just an offering. \u201cYou\u2019re about to be pulled at by people who don\u2019t know your body. Keep some for yourself.\u201d\n\nHe and Leah took their shoes off at the door of the village hall because the caretaker had that rule and also because respect is a thing you can practise. The place was a museum of minor triumphs. A faded noticeboard announced a jumble sale from 2007 with a zeal that time had not dimmed. The stage had curtains that had retired from being loudly red but still liked to remember the job. They chalked the floor and the chalk made their own stars, small and honest. Kids from the after-school club peered in and they let them, because the best way to start a myth is to let someone watch without paying for it. Leah moved the boxes like a librarian moving books. They practised the ladder\u2019s rise with a carefulness that felt like prayer and a rope that could have been a snake if it had tried harder. At eight forty-five Mr. Potter from the upholstery group popped his head back in and said, would they be needing the foam offcuts, and Leah said, keep your offcuts, we love you, and Mr. Potter blushed because no one had said that to him in decades and he\u2019d thought he was long done with blushing.\n\nMoney came into conversations like weather. They drew up a list of expenses and it made a thin column and then grew fatter when they remembered things like insurance and leaflets and the fact that people liked soft lighting even when they said they didn\u2019t. They applied for funds with a form that asked them to perform humility and ambition on the same page. Leah had more patience for boxes than he did and he blessed her with snacks and praise while she translated their bodies into words for a panel somewhere that would read them while eating a sandwich and deciding futures between bites. His father called with a business plan that relied heavily on the idea that people would pay to watch him run like a man on fire. His mother suggested the most sensible thing of all: ask the village to borrow space and time and hands. \u201cYou all raise each other here,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is why we live in a place like this.\u201d\n\nThey did a small thing first. A showing, Leah called it, though the piece was not a show yet, it was a creature being coaxed. They put three rows of chairs at the front and made tea and brought biscuits that were not posh but were offered like jewels. Thirty people came, which felt like a crowd made of relatives and the curious. His aunt drove from Luton and sat ramrod straight as if posture could keep the world\u2019s nonsense out. Jim came with Mavis and apologised when she barked with excitement exactly at the moment Rafi hopped the pretend fence, and then everyone laughed and the laugh was the kind that makes you feel you are exactly where you should be. He ran the piece small. No fog. No pyro. No camera that could see better than human eyes. He let the silence grow where it had grown under lights and found it did something different in a room with a notice about Tai Chi peeling at the corners. At the end, he stood and there was a second where he wanted to say something. He didn\u2019t. He bowed like someone whose mother had taught him what to do with gratitude in public, and Leah\u2019s eyes said: it works even when it whispers.\n\nThe day after, messages came of the kind that matter. \u201cMy lad is ten and never sits,\u201d Saira wrote back to say, \u201che sat.\u201d A man who had not spoken at the showing sent a photograph of his trainers at the door and wrote, \u201cRan this morning for the first time in twenty years. My knees are cross. Feels good.\u201d The school in Peterborough gave him a date and asked if they could film if they promised to delete every frame with a child\u2019s face, which was the kind of promise you signed your name to even though you knew the digital world could still smuggle you. He and Leah made a poster and took it to the post office and the woman behind the counter made a display that somehow made the word mile look like a cousin of miracle without anyone choosing that on purpose.\n\nOne afternoon, when the rain found its confidence again and did what it did to the lanes with relish, an email came from a man who formatted his name with a lot of capital letters and asked whether Rafi would consider joining a \u201ccelebrity series\u201d where he would be paired with a gymnast and teach them to \u201ctell their story through the medium of sprint.\u201d Rafi read it and thought of dollars and the sound of his mother\u2019s shoes on the stair and the pinboard on the fridge. He closed his eyes and saw two numbers: the cost of a new boiler and the cost of saying no. He wrote back that he was flattered, he was even grateful, but he was building a thing that did not survive well in rooms where story wore sequins and judges. The man wrote back a line that had the taste of a threat and he kept the email as proof that sometimes the world did not deserve the care you took with your sentences.\n\nThe distribution centre wrote too, finally, with the tone of an invitation that had lost its sprightliness. They were \u201ccurrently fully staffed\u201d but would \u201ckeep his details on file.\u201d He stared at that and had the odd sensation of falling without moving. Relief and resentment found the same chair. He picked the kettle up, put it down, picked it up again. He would need money. The piece would need money. He could clean the hall on Saturdays. He could stack cereals with a religiousness that still amused Vince. He could say yes to the school talks and the community centres and take the fees and make a stained-glass window out of small notes and coins and warm soup. He could ask his father to lay aside the bit of him that liked a miracle in exchange for the bit that was good with a hammer and shelves. He could live in the space between enough and not enough and build something steady.\n\nOn a morning that was almost spring if you squinted, Lo came to the hall and watched from the back like a man assessing a field for yield. He did not take notes because there are some things you don\u2019t make lists about. When Rafi had finished a section, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re doing the thing I tell the kids when they ask me about sprint and I say, it\u2019s about leaving without forgetting to take yourself. You go and you stay at the same time. It makes people cry. They don\u2019t know why.\u201d Rafi laughed because the line was too neat and not, and then his eyes did the thing you don\u2019t make jokes about. He put his hands on his thighs and breathed and said, \u201cTea,\u201d because there were words he could not say in daylight to men who had taught him other words.\n\nThey got a small grant that paid for light and for Leah\u2019s time in a way that made her sit down at the kitchen table and momentarily forget how to swallow. They got a call from a theatre in Cambridge that had a black box they weren\u2019t using on three consecutive Tuesdays and would they like to come and make the floor scuff on purpose. They said yes to all of it and then took turns remembering to sleep. Flo texted him a photo of a roll of tape with the words: it\u2019s still ours if you need it. Yvonne sent a message without warning: stew recipe, foolproof, will feed the whole hall, please stop starving out there, x. Rosanna appeared in his inbox sometimes with a link to an article about how attention becomes a job. He read them all. He did not fall through the cracks in between because Brampton was a net.\n\nThere were new small rituals. He put the pebble from the soundstage by the back door and touched it before he left as if he were proving to it that he was not being unfaithful to the floor he had loved before. He fixed the stuck front door instead of shouldering it because you can only slam against resistance for so long before it makes a pattern in you. He did the crossword with his mother even when he was late because clues are a way to believe in answers and they had both earned that belief. He took Mavis a pig ear he had looked up to make sure did not ruin dog stomachs, and Jim accepted it with the solemnity of a man who had buried three people and knew the value of small comforts. \u201cYou didn\u2019t fall,\u201d Jim said again one morning apropos of nothing, and Rafi said, \u201cNot then,\u201d and Jim nodded like a man who had watched a lifetime of then and now and knew both could change their minds.\n\nThe day they loaded the ladder into the back of a borrowed van to drive it to Cambridge, his phone rang with a number he didn\u2019t know. He balanced the rung against his shoulder and answered because he had started to practise saying hello to the unknown. The voice on the other end was warm and had the kind of smile that makes sound. She said her name was Kaia and that she worked with a festival of \u201csmall and intense things\u201d in the north. She had seen a clip in an ecosystem she refused to name and wanted to know if he would like to bring his mile to a room in a library that had a ceiling that understood hush and a floor that was tired of chairs. \u201cWe have no money,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we have bread and a roomful of people with ears.\u201d He looked at Leah who looked at him with the greed of a woman who loves bread and ears more than most things money can buy. He said yes and felt the click it made in the map of the year. He did not yet know the road or the hotel with beige and no windows, or the one person in that northern library who would stand up too quickly when he finished and knock his knee on the chair and swear softly and then go outside and run because sometimes you have to obey your legs immediately. He did not know that his father would learn how to livestream a Northern festival and that his mother would think every town with rain was the same and worry accordingly. He did not know that he would learn to sleep on trains better than in beds and that he would acquire the precise understanding of which Tupperware lids never betray you. He did not know that people would begin to email him with their runs\u2014their first, their worst, their mornings\u2014and that his inbox would become, in its way, a cardiology ward.\n\nHe knew only that he would keep moving until the map of where he had been began to look like a story. He knew the line between attention and being seen and he put his foot on the one he wanted. He knew that he would eat the stew Yvonne had vouchsafed with a confidence that would make his mother both proud and slightly jealous. He knew that he loved Leah in a way that hovered companionably near words but did not force them, and that if anyone tried to force them for him he would run the other way for a bit and then circle back and tell her anyway in a yard between a hall and a hedge. He knew that when the sky made up its mind and cracked into blue, there would be speed and he would offer it to the nearest patch of air like a gift that cost both of them something and returned more than it took. He knew, with a surety that made the floor less wobbly, that he would still be here in the mornings, when the mist rolled off the Ouse like steam from an overworked kettle, and that the path would greet him as if he hadn\u2019t left at all.Chapter 6\n\nThe van had been borrowed from a man who trusted everyone until about 1998 and had been practising caution ever since. It smelt of old rugs and something like cloves, and the glove compartment contained a map of Britain that showed motorways as if they were bravely invented yesterday. Rafi and Leah wedged the ladder with a lattice of bungee cords and promises, and tucked boxes around it the way you tuck blankets around a sleeping child. Maya stood at the gate holding a flask like a benediction. She had wrapped sandwiches in greaseproof paper because she refused to believe in cellophane. \u201cBread and ears,\u201d she said, because she had liked that line and had turned it into a packing instruction. Rafi kissed her cheek twice, once for the road and once for the return, and his father pretended he was indifferent to the van\u2019s rust while checking its tyres with the toe of his shoe in a way that suggested prayer.\n\nThey drove north with the ladder humming like a tuning fork every time they crossed a seam in the road. The hedges broke up into moors that looked like a map had been rubbed until it forgot the edges of things. Leah read out place names like charms. She kept a list she said she would use for characters she had not met yet: Kirkby Stephen, Barnard Castle, Stainmore. She sang, quietly, because she sang to the road the way some people sang to kettles to make them boil faster. They stopped once on the hard shoulder because the rear door made a sound that had to be investigated immediately and found nothing but wind, which was reassuring and not. They ate the sandwiches in a lay-by where a lunching lorry driver offered them leftover apples with the generosity of someone who liked to see people moving a purpose in a van not meant for glamour. When the land began to dissolve into brick and viaduct and a river surprisingly wide, Leah reached over and put her hand on Rafi\u2019s knee like a reminder that bodies have anchors, and he felt the ladder\u2019s humming stop inside him even as the van rattled on.\n\nKaia met them on the library steps with a scarf that could have padded a house. She had hair that did not obey a straight line and a way of looking at you as if she were borrowing your face for a painting. The library itself had the air of a cathedral that had run out of saints and started stocking paperbacks instead. Stone rubbed by years fell down into carpet gone bald in particular patches; the ceiling had the kind of arches that make you instinctively whisper. \u201cYou found us,\u201d Kaia said, as if other people had set off for this place and never arrived. \u201cExcellent. I\u2019ve got three volunteers and a librarian called Mr. Dalton who uses silence like a weapon, but he\u2019s agreed to let us have a bit of noise if it\u2019s useful noise.\u201d She led them in past posters for poetry nights and a notice about a knitting group that had chosen a name with a pun in it and then regretted it. Children were being taught to handle books like animals. An old man slept with his mouth open under a banner that read READ YOUR WAY TO FAR PLACES, which felt like a lesson in how to take instructions seriously.\n\nThey set the space the way you arrange a table for people you care about. Between stacks and a stairwell they conjured a lane. Leah held a tape measure with the look of a person holding a wand, and Rafi learned the dimensions of aisles with a respect usually reserved for rivers. They met the volunteers: a boy with a hoodie bitten by cigarette burns who laughed like he was apologising for something from three summers ago; a woman who had brought her daughter and told Kaia plain that she\u2019d come to see if someone could make her teenager listen without shouting; a retired teacher called Moira who had the kind of competence that makes you check your shoelaces for neatness. Mr. Dalton appeared like a plot point and approved the positioning of a rubber mat with the solemnity of an altar boy. \u201cNo running between the stacks,\u201d he said automatically, and then stopped himself, and something like a laugh cracked the dryness around his mouth.\n\nIn rehearsal, the ladders seemed almost pious in that room. The hum of circulation was different, the air full of the damp wool of coats and library breath. The floor gave a hush back to his shoe that made him weigh every footfall as if each could be a word too loud. He found out fast that the turn by the returns desk needed to be slower or the corner of an oak shelf was going to acquaint itself with his ribs in a way they would all regret. Leah adjusted the timing of light because there was no light to adjust; she placed lamps instead, desk lamps with green glass shades borrowed from the room upstairs, and called it design like a dare. The volunteers offered their hands, and in the absence of headsets and Flo\u2019s choreography, they moved the boxes with a gentleness that made Rafi\u2019s throat tighten because they were moving more than objects. The hoodie boy watched the line he was making with suspicion and then pride, which is how roads get built. When they ran the piece the first time, someone in the upstairs reading room dropped a book and the thud rolled down the stairwell like a thought that had reconsidered. Kaia stood at the back with her arms folded, not in judgement but like a person trying to contain heat between her ribs and spare it for later.\n\nThe audience came like weather. They weren\u2019t fans, not like in a television studio; they were an arrangement of neighbors, city strangers, stray lunchers, and three women whose hair was perfect in a manner that meant time had been spent. A man in a suit sat alone and took off his watch as if to agree to being here. A little girl chewed the end of her sleeve and then stopped because her mother squeezed her hand once and that was all the instruction necessary. A student with a ring in his lip studiously pretended to be bored and then failed. When Rafi began, it wasn\u2019t with the drum of a TV track; it was with the sound of a pencil somewhere, with the crackle of a radiator trying to be useful, with the slow intake of breath that libraries require before anything happens. He laid out his distance between the stacks like you lay out an argument between people who love each other. He kept some of the big beats, because they were honest, but the room took the volume it could bear and returned it as resonance rather than thunder.\n\nThe ladder\u2019s rise in that building was stranger and cleaner than it had ever been. A corner light hit the rung as if it had been waiting its whole career for this job. Someone made a noise that would have got you shushed in another context and Mr. Dalton did not shush them. Rafi found the pause he had marked in pencil in his head and let it deepen because the room held him up instead of gravity. When he finished he didn\u2019t bow so much as tilt, because there was no stage for the gesture to land on. The suit man stood too quickly and banged his knee on the chair in front; he swore, and then laughed, and then left, and then, through the glass doors, Rafi saw him run a short way down the street like someone who had remembered an appointment with his old self. A woman cried in the way you cry when you remember to blink. Kaia clapped alone at first, and then together was made, and it was enough.\n\nAfter, they ate the bread. Kaia had meant it literally. There were loaves from the bakery around the corner, a loaf with seeds that dared you to bite and one with a gloss as if it had been varnished. There were bowls of soup that had been called \u201cwith substance\u201d on the poster, and for once the truth matched the taste. People queued as they do when English people are determined to be orderly even about gratitude. The hoodie boy took two bowls and a crust and left without speaking to anyone except Leah, to whom he said, \u201cThat bit where you do the small jump and then the little one\u2014I thought you were going to not,\u201d which was how you made hospitality into a review. Moira squeezed Rafi\u2019s forearm with a pressure that would cut diamonds. Mr. Dalton said, \u201cBooks can\u2019t do everything,\u201d and his voice had to fight its own dryness to get out. Kaia introduced them to a poet who was writing a book about attention, and he laughed at the idea as if it were a cat that had sat on the piano instead of Bach.\n\nThey slept above a bakery that night in a bed that had seen things but was still doing its job with dignity. The room held a tiny sink that could not commit to being hot but was charming about it. The scent of tomorrow\u2019s bread rose through the floorboards and made everything seem kinder. Leah sat at the end of the bed with her legs tucked under and drew the shelves out of memory in a notebook that had lost the first ten pages years ago and did not miss them. Rafi lay down and then sat up and then lay down again because his knee had begun to hum with the smugness of effort. They talked with their heads against the wall because walls listen differently. Leah said she had been invited to a residency in Glasgow by a woman who made art with light and patience and a toaster she treated like a pet, and the residency came with access to equipment and a stipend so small it would pay for exactly the amount of coffee she couldn\u2019t drink or she would jitter through ceilings. She asked what he thought like you ask a mirror for advice. He looked at her and saw the thread of her work unspooling on another city\u2019s pavement; he saw nights without her voice settling the corners of a room with jokes thin as knives; he felt a little jealous and told the truth anyone who loves a person who makes things has to learn. \u201cGo,\u201d he said, and then added, because he could not help it and did not want to, \u201cand come back or let me come to you; there\u2019s no prize for choosing one world forever.\u201d\n\nThey got up at a time that was not morning or night and went out to find the bakery already in full hymn. The woman behind the till identified them as the ladder people and smuggled a bun into their bag and told them not to argue. They drove home with the ladder less talkative, as if it had learned something it needed to chew on. The hills leaned nearer to the van on the way back, or perhaps it was only that Rafi and Leah had become quieter and so the landscape took the opportunity to speak. They stopped once to pee in a lay-by and Leah used a toilet in a caff that had a notice reading NO POETS above the hand dryer; she came back with a grin that stayed for three junctions. They made a game of counting the number of times Rafi\u2019s father would pretend he had only just arrived when they pulled into the street and he was already standing at the gate with a screwdriver and news.\n\nBringing the piece home from elsewhere changed its shape. The village hall looked at them like a friend who has read the book you love and has questions. People began to treat Tuesday and Thursday as events you could add to a calendar. There were teenagers at the back pretending not to look and older men pretending they were just walking by and then discovering their feet chose the door. Saira sent a message saying the Kettering lads had given a standing ovation that had been twenty percent mockery and eighty percent sincere, and so, balanced, had not collapsed. The school in Peterborough had set a date and, in a line that should have only belonged to farce, asked if they could bring the ladder, and Rafi wrote back that they would bring two ladders if it would make the boys think twice about what you can build.\n\nAt Peterborough he watched a boy throw his jacket at a chair like a gauntlet and then sit on the floor when everyone else sat on chairs because chairs are an allegiance. He watched a girl who had drawn eyes on her hands so she could look twice. He began the way he had learned to begin with young people: without a preamble, as if you had burst into their day and would leave it and they should be allowed to decide whether you were a thief or a guest. He did a small version and let the pauses be longer than the impatient part of him preferred, and the room rewarded him with a silence that had purpose. When they asked questions, the boy with the chair jacket asked, \u201cWhat do you do if you can\u2019t run,\u201d and the question did not care about shin splints. Rafi looked at his knee and then at his hands and then at the bit of the floor where the polish had given up. \u201cYou find the bit of your body that still moves,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might be a very small bit. You do that bit until the rest remembers. Or you borrow someone else\u2019s bit. People can be very useful.\u201d The boy absorbed that, or pretended to, and then held the edge of a box while Rafi shifted it, and their hands bumped in a way that told Rafi as much about adolescence as any book would have.\n\nHis father, consistent as tide, tried to find the agent before the agent found him. Two men called about being intermediaries between him and brands, and one woman offered him \u201ca friendly shape to your decisions,\u201d which sounded like the softest threat. His father liked the woman because she had a voice that reminded him of a radio show from 1994, and he disliked the men because one of them wore a scarf indoors. They sat in the kitchen with the kettle ticking like a metronome and argued in the respectful register they had learned when Rafi was sixteen and almost catastrophic. \u201cYou have to say yes to one of them,\u201d his father said. \u201cThe world doesn\u2019t just let people make things. It takes tax, it takes time, it takes money, and if someone wants to pay for your shoes, let them pay.\u201d Rafi, carefully, because he had been careless before and it always cost, tried to explain that the wrong money pulled the wrong thread and then you found your jumper in your hands. \u201cWe can do it small,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can do it slow. We can do it with people and bread and roofs that leak and a poster in the post office. I don\u2019t want to be a thing you can buy in the bits between talent shows.\u201d His father drank tea as if it were a counterargument. The words made marks on the table that wiped away later because love typically has a cloth ready. They compromised, because both of them were good at it: his father would keep collecting messages in a notebook with a phone number Maya had insisted not be Rafi\u2019s, and Rafi would promise to listen to one pitch a week so that they would not miss the good fish while swearing off trawlers.\n\nHe hurt his knee properly in March, which was silly because it happened when he stumbled on the two inches between the hall\u2019s stage and the floor, a danger everyone knew and therefore no one saw. He felt the familiar pull and something like tearing paper, and he swore quietly and sat and then lay down because sitting wasn\u2019t enough and lying down was too much, and Leah\u2019s face above him did that thing faces do when they want to be two faces at once: a calm one for the person looking up and a panicked one for the room. Lo arrived because someone had texted him and he always arrived when knees were involved. He poked and said kind things that had verbs in them and made telephone calls to a physiotherapist who had a waiting list and a soft spot for teachers, and managed to make Rafi feel that this was a perimeter rather than a cliff. For a week he didn\u2019t run. He learned the weight of walking again as if it were a skill. He taped up with a seriousness that would have made Flo proud and slept with his leg arranged like a question he was trying to answer politely.\n\nThe piece learned to live without speed. Leah, who understood that form is what you do when the old shape won\u2019t hold, took the boxes and made a different language with them. She placed them so that moving through them was like reading a poem out loud when there\u2019s a word you have to pause for because it belongs to a dead friend. Rafi found a way to show breath without taking off. He learned to let stillness be the trick instead of the trick being proof he could conquer the floor. In the hall, the teenagers at the back unlocked their shoulders because stillness felt less like being dared and more like being let in; at the library in the second town Kaia sent them to, a woman who had once danced in nightclubs and now danced in her kitchen stood and showed him how hips remember even when knees don\u2019t, and he gave her back the microphone he did not have.\n\nKaia kept calling. Her festival of small and intense things had found itself a circuit by accident. Libraries told other libraries that a boy came and made their carpet do something worthwhile. Community centres added \u201cbreath and ladders\u201d to their schedules in between Pilates and toddler sessions. A town with a pier written in a language the water understood asked them to bring the piece at dusk, and they learned that gulls have an opinion about everything. They stayed above pubs and in spare rooms and once in a house where the owners were away and had left a note that said, help yourself to anything except the rhubarb gin, and then added in a different handwriting, especially the rhubarb gin. On a bus somewhere between Derby and Mansfield a girl watched Rafi online and then realised it was him and did that narrow-eyed calculation people do when they are trying to decide whether a human and their image can be reconciled, and then said, \u201cYou looked taller,\u201d and he mended her disappointment with a joke about ladders. Leah\u2019s email came, with the Glasgow residency\u2019s proper words and stamp and a promise of a tiny stipend and a larger room, and she sat with it as if someone had offered her a life she couldn\u2019t remember ordering. They promised each other something without fingernails for grip and chose to call it a plan.\n\nTelevision called too. A producer whose voice had been cleverer than him when he was tired left a message about \u201cChampions,\u201d a specials programme made mostly of people whose names had put on muscle, and suggested a return that would be \u201cgood for your brand presence.\u201d The email that followed was full of everything that had made him stand up straighter and run the other way since the final: time slots, the name of a singer whose management would be \u201cdelighted to cross-promote,\u201d a suggestion that they could \u201cenhance\u201d the piece with aerial silk because audiences loved vertical. He read it twice and then stood in the kitchen and told the kettle everything he wanted to say because kettles are good at confidentiality. He wrote back in careful we\u2019s instead of I\u2019s, because he had learned to be plural for the work that mattered. He thanked them and did not say yes; he thanked them and did not say no; he asked them what they could do for a tour of libraries and village halls and youth clubs with no pyro at all. Then he put his phone on the dresser and went to the hall to show Leah how stillness could be more arrogant than a leap.\n\nThe day the Glasgow decision became a yes, they took the news to the river. The Ouse had its shoulders down. Swans moved like they were trying not to be blamed for anything. Leah carried a paper bag with two doughnuts you had to eat immediately or regret for hours. They sat on the low wall and the stone showed them last summer in flaws and fossil and foot. Leah was effervescent in the way she got when it wasn\u2019t about speech, her hands making patterns in the air that made Rafi want to map the air itself. He tried to say he would be fine and instead said, \u201cI want the sound of you to stay in the room,\u201d and she put her head on his shoulder and said, \u201cThen you\u2019ll have to make rooms that hold sound,\u201d and it was the sort of exchange that looks like nothing from the outside and becomes, later, a hinge.\n\nThey celebrated in a fashion that no one would have recognised as such. They ate dal with the last of the ghee Maya had tucked at the back of the cupboard for a winter emergency and called this as close as they could get. They invited Lo and Kaia because Kaia had arrived in time for a showing and was sleeping on the sofa with a blanket that smelt faintly of bonfires. Yvonne sent a parcel that looked like a practical joke and turned out to be spices and recipes and a note that read, \u201cIf you can\u2019t eat well, you can\u2019t do anything well, stop arguing with me.\u201d Rosanna wrote an email that was longer than a text and shorter than a letter, congratulating and advising and not asking for anything back. Rafi\u2019s father opened a bottle from the bottom of a cupboard and the cork became a small missile that dots the paintwork still.\n\nThere were setbacks that did not deserve capital letters and earned them anyway in the diaries of people invested. A volunteer in Hull dropped a box on her toe and went home swearing that the show had made her foot religious. The van lost its right brake light because a boy on a bike had invented a theory that it would survive a smack and was wrong. A form for a small grant disappeared into an email address that was technically alive and practically dead, and Leah called it the bureaucracy of ghosts. A man in a town whose name began with C took exception to the fact that Rafi had said no to returning to television and wrote him a letter in capitals explaining exactly why he was letting the village down; the letter went up on the kitchen pinboard and down again when Maya decided the wall deserved better manners. There were mornings when the damp got into the hall and into Rafi\u2019s bone, and he did the thing he had taught other people to do: he moved the very small bit that still moved.\n\nThe day before Leah left for Glasgow, they drove to the coast because the map needed an edge. The sea was grey and honest. They took their shoes off and let their ankles forget they belonged to land; they ran, slowly for Rafi and normally for Leah, and the sand kept their secrets. They used the wind like a friend you can shout into and not annoy. On the way back they stopped in a caf\u00e9 heavily invested in bunting and shared a plate of chips with the seriousness of people agreeing terms. They talked about schedules until schedules began to sound like a game of snakes and ladders. They sat in the car on the lane into Brampton with the radio on low and neither of them could remember what the presenter had been saying, which was perfect because it meant the words between them had been louder. At the door, Maya hugged Leah like a daughter and muttered instructions about keeping warm near radiators and not trusting men who smiled with just their mouths. Rafi watched Leah pull her bag up her shoulder and knew in the plainest possible way what people mean when they say something will take time.\n\nIt did. The weeks that followed had an odd gait. The house was the same size and had to redistribute its echoes. Rafi ran early and late. He attempted a crossword and his mother filled in two clues for him because she mistrusted long words more than she mistrusted bad weather. He stood in the hall alone and broke chalk with his thumb and remembered to warm up because forgetting now had consequences. He put the ladder up and the ladder looked taller without Leah\u2019s hands on it, and he stood at the bottom of it and had the sensible thought that he should not go up, and then the less sensible thought that he could teach other hands to place it well. He invited the Brampton football lads to a session with the inducement of hot chocolate, and they arrived with their scepticism like an extra layer and left with their cheeks raw and their layers on their arms.\n\nLeah sent photos of equipment that looked like astrology. She sent a message about a light that was both a square and not a square, which thrilled her half to distraction. She sent a picture of a street she had walked at three in the morning because her head had not read Glasgow\u2019s bedtimes properly yet and she had gone out to argue. She sent a video of a toaster that had become a sculpture and then, because Leah could not resist, toast. Rafi sent her a small clip of a boy in the hall skipping the way kids skip without remembering when they learned, and a woman in a cardigan too big for her shoulder width who cried when he paused, and a stack of chairs because she liked chairs even when she said she didn\u2019t. They kept each other always by at least two streets and a coil of wire, and when they did not speak, they did not panic. Sometimes he caught himself counting his breaths in her voice and did not tell her because he wanted the trick to last.\n\nThe library in the third town had a leak and warning tape that made everything look like a crime scene. They did it anyway because water and art have always had to learn to tolerate each other. Mr. Dalton had told his cousin, it turned out, and the cousin was the librarian here, and he had entirely different ideas about noise and had printed out signs that said CLAP HERE with arrows; Rafi took the signs down and put them back up in places where they would be useful instead of bossy. The suit did not come but a woman with dirt under her nails did, and she told him afterwards that she had been running since she was eleven and between shifts and had never told anyone because it was hers. He gave her nothing but the nod you give a person when your secrets recognise each other.\n\nFlo turned up one Thursday, unexpected and inevitable, with a thermos and a roll of tape she probably did sleep with under her pillow after all. She watched and did not correct even when the tape on the floor offended her tidiness. She hugged him at the end with the side of her body that is used to heavy objects and said, \u201cI see you,\u201d and he believed her because she is the sort of woman who tells the truth even when it is mild. Yvonne sent him stew in jars with labels she had written in capitals and then drawn flowers on for no reason except joy. Rosanna\u2019s email about Champions grew increasingly polite and then stopped, which he appreciated because it meant someone had listened to a no that had been too carefully offered to be fun to receive.\n\nWhen Leah came back between light installations and lectures about light refracting through history, her bag bumped the hall door and she kissed him like you kiss someone you have identified as home and you have come back to your own sofa. She found the hall warmer because of all the breath that had been stored in it and the ladder easier because other hands had learned to lift as if lifting were not a way to show off. He watched her look at the room like a woman asking a question of a mirror and finding the right one staring back. She looked at him and smiled in a way that could not be misread by anyone with half a heart and he understood that whatever they were building had survived this small test and now deserved the next one.\n\nSometimes, after everyone had left, he and Leah sat on the stage step that had bruised his knee and held mugs of tea like proof they existed in the same temperature. They talked about the places the piece could go and the places it might refuse to go, because art is particular like that. They talked about money with the professionalism of people who had learned that hope doesn\u2019t pay for broom heads. They spoke about perhaps teaching, perhaps making a course in moving and listening for kids who had only been taught to move in straight lines. Leah told him about Glasgow\u2019s square light finally acting like a square, and he told her about a boy in Kettering who had tried to nick the chalk and then put it back because he had started thinking of lines differently. They drew maps on the backs of leaflets as if they had invented cartography.\n\nThere was a day of snow that thickened the village in the way snow does when it decides to stay. They cancelled the showing because people broke themselves on pavements for less. Rafi ran anyway, because he always did in snow; he liked his shoes\u2019 arrogance against its powder, and he liked the way the sky felt nearer because noise had been muffled. He saw Jim and Mavis because he always saw Jim and Mavis. Mavis had a coat that made her look like a small badly disguised sheep, and she left footprints like tiny commas. Jim told him the story of his wife\u2019s first winter here, how she had taught him that snow was to be walked in, not complained about, and Rafi listened because sometimes you collect the details of other people\u2019s marriages like ornaments to hang from your own future. When he got home his mother warmed him like you warm a thing you had not been sure the day would return, and his father said something about grit and duty and Rafi kissed his head without asking permission because adults did not get enough kisses and the boy inside him had learned that you don\u2019t wait for those.\n\nAt the end of that snow day, when everyone had already put their kettles on in anticipation of a future, an email arrived from someone who had tried to write like Koine Greek and failed but had succeeded in being kind. It was from a physiotherapist, not Lo\u2019s friend but another, a woman who had watched a clip online and thought she could help him unlearn the angle that kept making his knee cruel. She offered no miracles and a list of appointments that had hours Rafi didn\u2019t have and a rate he could barely afford, and he wrote back yes anyway, because bodies cannot read calendars or bank statements and still have to be answered.\n\nHe slept then the sleep of someone who had learned that making things was less about being chosen and more about choosing, who had learned that ladders are about reaching but also about coming down carefully to the floor that loved you first, who had learned he was much braver in rooms with chairs than in rooms with glitter. He woke with the mist sitting on the Ouse in its old reliable pose, and he took the map of all the rooms he had visited and folded it back into his pocket because he would need the warmth. He went downstairs to find his mother spoiling the tea leaves with boiled water and his father pretending he had not got up to stir the porridge already, and he smiled at both of them with all his good teeth and said, because you have to keep saying it until it is too normal for legend, \u201cMorning.\u201dChapter 8\n\nAnita\u2019s clinic had no time for candles. It smelt of eucalyptus and disinfectant and an optimism so practical it put its hair up. The waiting room chairs made everyone the same height. A poster of a human knee showed a cross-section of tendons and words that were both familiar and a little comic\u2014patella, meniscus, the Latin for a hinge pretending to be a cathedral. A delivery driver with tape on three fingers read a four-month-old cycling magazine with concentration you would not waste on scripture. An older woman with fencing scars on her forearm tied and untied her shoelace as if she could knot pain into submission. Anita came out with a clipboard and a ponytail that had given up obedience a decade ago, and when she looked at Rafi, she looked like a person measuring the distance between a problem and a solution she intended to reach.\n\nHe expected briskness and received it, but wrapped in something warmer and older, the tone of a woman whose grandmother had taught her to boil bones into broth and who now did the same for ligaments. She asked questions that insisted on whole answers and then, when he gave her half, lifted an eyebrow until the rest came. She placed her fingers on his knee with the attention of someone listening to a lea of bees. She watched how he stood, which was news to him, because he had thought standing was just what came with legs, and she taught him how the foot had been a small liar and the hip a noble idiot long before the knee had had its say. She made him step up and down on a block and laughed at the solemnity he brought to the task. \u201cYou run like a poet when you\u2019re working,\u201d she said, \u201cand walk like a man who doesn\u2019t love himself enough. Put your feet under you. Make your backside do its job. The knee is Switzerland, it only complains because the neighbours are fighting.\u201d\n\nThe work was slow and humiliating in the way useful things are. He learned the kind of pain that asks for a chair and not a surgeon. He taped in patterns and stood on his toes brushing his teeth because Anita said that was the easiest way to remind stubborn calves they had a role. She put a metronome on his phone and told him not to chase speed yet but cadence, as if running could be taught by ticking. He lay with a band looped above his knees and opened and closed them until the muscles that did not know their own names introduced themselves. She taught him to press his big toe into the floor and felt a small but seismic change in how his arch woke, which made him feel like someone had wired a light to a circuit he had always thought was broken. When he left on the first day the ultrasound gel clung to his skin with the obstinacy of grief, and he liked it in spite of himself because persistence looked good on him and on other things that wanted to last.\n\nOn the walk home from the first appointment, the village had its hands in its pockets and its eyes on the ground, the way places do when rain has happened and they are trying to pretend it was a plan. He saw Jim in his usual spot and would have passed quietly, but Jim tapped the dog lead against his palm in a way that meant a message. \u201cMy Mavis says you\u2019ll be good,\u201d he said, as if the narrow-eyed terrier had a medical degree and favoured knees over bones. \u201cShe\u2019s got a nose for these things.\u201d Mavis looked up, snorted, and sneezed in a way that managed to be both rude and affectionate. Rafi knelt and scratched her scruff and felt the knee complain and greet him both, a domestic quarrel halfway through being resolved. He told Jim about the metronome. Jim said he\u2019d once tried to make himself walk to the beat of the shipping forecast and had ended up buying a newspaper he did not need. They parted with the easy ritual of men who had watched each other in all seasons and found each other present.\n\nLeah made the hall warm even before she arrived by the door; anticipation does that. She had the Glasgow light in her skin, the reflection of a square pretending not to be a square still in the backs of her eyes. She put her bag down, found the tape, looked at him, looked at his knee, and did not ask how he was, because the answer would be in his gait. He showed her the homework Anita had written in a tidy script that still somehow smelt of eucalyptus, and she read it like she reads scores, turning the page with a thumb as if permission had to be earned. Together, they picked apart the piece to make a nest for this new gait. They took the arrogance out of one jump and left behind something that looked like confidence instead. They stretched the pause by the noticeboard where the Tai Chi sign peeled, because the room liked it and people\u2019s shoulders lowered when he did. Leah held the metronome and, wicked, put a beat in that felt like house music for six seconds, then returned to a more generous tick. He swore at her, loving and sincere, and she grinned, admiring and shameless.\n\nCambridge\u2019s black box gave them back a version of themselves that had been waiting for a higher ceiling. The tech there did not sigh at ladders; they measured them and built a small metal safety life for each rung. The room took light like a thirsty animal. The first run read as too big, and then they taught themselves, as they had in the library, to let the piece take the volume it could use. People came with brains that had been fed by books, which makes no difference to lungs, and they inhaled at the same places as the librarian\u2019s cousin\u2019s town. Afterward, a man who had once published a paper about improvisation in early modern verse stood at the bar with a beer and cried without noise, and then said, too loudly, \u201cWell done,\u201d as if he needed to turn feeling into examination to keep standing. A young woman with hair the colour of chestnut burrs told Leah she had been trying to write about breath for months and this would help and Leah made a sound like a tiny bird being startled into life.\n\nMoney was a list that grew teeth. The van drank petrol like a cousin you cannot send away from the table. Insurance wrote to ask whether any audience members were likely to attempt to climb the ladder on their own after an event and wanted to know what signage would be present if so, as if the answer could ever be truly calming. Anita\u2019s appointments came with a price, and Rafi paid them gladly and then went to the shop to take extra shifts without calling them that, stacking tins in a row that pleased both his boss and his mother\u2019s sense of order. He and Leah went to a meeting at the council and sat under a strip light that made everyone look ghostly. They spoke to a panel who had the air of judges at a show neither of them respected, and they did their best to be brief and persuasive without performing gratitude as if mending a shirt in public. An old councillor with ears like surprised paper said the ladder worried him, and Leah said softly that they could do it without the ladder if that was what the room needed, and he looked disappointed, as if he had wanted to be the sort of man who had forbidden something and been resisted, and Rafi felt almost sorry for his thwarted heroics.\n\nKaia\u2019s calls now came with the background noise of other people\u2019s lives. She would be whispering in a stairwell while a poet refused to go on second because of a superstition about sevens. She would be stirring something that clinked against enamel. She would be shepherding volunteers into a confidence about their own thresholds. Her festival of small and intense things had grown in a manner that made her laugh and also list, and she sent them to a mill that had decided to be a community centre and to a school where the caretaker had the keys to every door ever manufactured and a face like a walnut. In one city the power failed three minutes after Rafi began. There was a small, wet collective gasp because English buildings are afraid of their own darkness. Flo would have shouted solutions and sent people running for gels and batteries; here there was only Kaia with a torch she had grabbed out of her bag and a child whose mother had taught them to carry a torch always because it made you useful in winter. Kaia handed the light to the child with strict instructions and the child shone it like a blessing. Rafi looked up and found a room that had decided to go with him anyway. He took the piece down to its skeleton. He counted out loud when he would have breathed silently. He let his foot fall make the beat. He made shadow into another body. People leaned forward in their chairs as if they were at the side of a lane and the runner had appeared suddenly and would disappear if their eyes wandered. Someone at the back whispered \u201clisten,\u201d and the room obeyed. When the lights came back, no one clapped immediately; they stood instead, and the applause, when it arrived, felt less like noise than like a building starting its own heart.\n\nThe boy who had thrown his jacket at Peterborough turned up in Kettering without announcing himself and stood at the side, near the exit, as if he wanted to practise leaving. He had cut his hair not because he had been told to but because something had bored him. He had the slant of a boy who tries to become smaller while still demanding to be seen. He watched and then did not disappear. He hung around the boxes afterward with the air of a person casing a joint and then asked Leah whether she needed hands, which even he knew was a ridiculous question. She put gaffer tape strips on his palms in an initiation that had no ceremony and told him to pull when she said pull. He did pull and did not drop anything and at one point looked at the ladder with such hunger that Rafi thought of himself at fifteen wanting a line on a track to move just so. They found out his name was Ty because Akan names have travelled and then became English without asking permission and because he said, awkward, \u201cIt\u2019s Tyler, but no one calls me that except my nan.\u201d He started coming Tuesdays and Thursdays and brought a friend once who laughed until his hoodie shook and then and then quietly came back Thursday without the hoodie. When Ty wasn\u2019t there, Rafi felt the gap and did not admit it because men can be stubborn for no good reason.\n\nRafi\u2019s father approached the problem of decisions as if it were a cupboard to be built, with shelves and screws and instructions that had been translated twice. He kept the notebook Maya had insisted on, a fat thing with an elastic that bit and pages that smelled of new. He wrote down numbers in the tidy hand he had saved for cheques and thank-you cards and words he did not want anyone to misread. He presented Rafi with one possibility a week as agreed and took rejection with a mouth that did not sulk but knew how. He also, in the third week of Anita\u2019s plan, did something uncharacteristic. He put on trainers that belonged more to dog walking than exertion and stood at the bottom of the stairs as if calling a taxi. \u201cCome,\u201d he said, and Rafi, who was not sure which of them was being called, put his own shoes back on. They walked first because you do not take a village man into running like dragging takes a suitcase back from a holiday. They walked to the bridge and then to the halfway mark of the unfinished hedge. They shared a look that stood for permission without godmothers. His father trotted then, and Rafi saw his father\u2019s body turn back into a body he knew from photographs, and a shock of tenderness went through him so quickly he missed two whole breaths. The older man ran like a caravan setting off, steady because there was nowhere else to be. He lasted longer than either of them would have predicted and then pretended he had only meant to go that far. When he stopped, he did not wheeze; he laughed. \u201cDog will outrun me,\u201d he said about a dog he did not own, and Rafi said, useless and whole, \u201cGood.\u201d\n\nThe letter from Champions came one more time, very polite, with a subject line that had learned to emulate human. It offered verticality again\u2014silk, rigs, the magic of professional harnessing\u2014and name-checked a singer whom Rafi had never heard but whose face he had seen twenty times on the co-op magazines because people with hair like that must have a quote next to their jaw. It offered a fee that would pay Anita and the van and the ladder\u2019s stiffening and new gaffer tape until kingdom come. It promised that this time they understood his ethos and would let the piece speak as it wanted to speak and would only ask that he not wear \u201cmuted tones\u201d because the camera loved him more if he did not try to pretend he was a pavement. He sat with the email and then went to the hall and turned on the big lights and sat on the floor with his back to the stage and his knees up because Anita would have told him off if he had flattened them. He watched the dust perform its ballet in the gold air. He put the email on loud in his head and listened to how the words crashed into the ribs of the room. He read it to Leah and to Maya and then to himself in the mirror in the staff toilet at the shop because that had been his rehearsal space for shock before and could be again. In the end he wrote an answer that was a thank you and a no and a plan all at once. He wrote that he had found where the piece fit and it was in rooms where people breathed each other into being. He wrote that if the show ever wanted to point a camera at a library without asking it to be purple, they could call him. He pressed send and felt that particular mix of relief and fear that comes when you have taken water away from a plant and asked it to grow stronger roots. He told his father with the respect of a man who had once thrown a door shut and regretted the echo for years. His father looked at him, then at the ledger of his own hopes, then at his wife stirring dal, and nodded like a man signing a treaty that might yet be worth the ink.\n\nThe physiotherapist\u2019s work stitched itself into everything. He found himself standing better when he poured tea and could feel when he slouched to please other people\u2019s discomfort, which was a fascinating discovery because he had not known posture could be politeness. He felt the metronome when he chopped onions, which turned dinner into a practice that Leah found both admirable and infuriating, because no one wants to marry a man who taps when you are trying not to burn garlic. He started sitting on the hall floor with kids while talking about breath because sitting on chairs had made him the wrong height for listening. Ty, who was eighteen if you added kindness and mischief like tax, asked Anita to show him how to tape an ankle because a boy on his estate had twisted something that would become two weeks of bed without help, and Anita taught him, and Ty did it, and that boy somewhere lay with his ankle neat and his pride held together by a grid of pink.\n\nSpring arrived suddenly like a dinner guest you had forgotten to expect and instantly forgave for being early. The river lost its shoulders. The lane sprouted dandelions like exclamation marks. The birds had a union meeting and decided in favour of ridiculous noise. Leah\u2019s residency ended for a time and she returned with a new way of looking at everything a bright rectangle could hover over. She taught Rafi to place a lamp so it found his shoe and made the smallest step look like a sentence he meant. He taught her to breathe in counts of easy, medium, hard, because everything was training if you named it clearly. They began to allow themselves to make future in sentences longer than one clause. They spoke about a week in June where they would do four halls in four towns and call it a tour because no one else would, and a month in September where they would do fewer rooms and thicker conversations with kids who believed shoulders were for armour. Maya, practical as always, began hoarding Tupperware. Rafi\u2019s father sourced a second-hand trolley for the ladder that would not lose a wheel on cobbles, and a man in the hardware who had refused to give him discount for a decade suddenly did and said it was about community and not because Rafi had been on the television, which made everyone smile as if they had forgotten to do it earlier.\n\nThey began taking other people\u2019s stories on purpose. After a showing, they put a paper on the table and wrote, breathe here, and left a pen. People began to leave words like seeds you press into soil with one finger. \u201cFirst run, after chemo.\u201d \u201cI ran away from him and toward something else.\u201d \u201cI am seventy-one and my left foot thinks it is twenty; I let it.\u201d \u201cI cannot run, my hip is iron, but I stand and breathe at your pause and I am moving there.\u201d The paper filled and they replaced it and that filled too, and they realised they were collecting a map that belonged to everyone. Kaia cried when she saw it and then stopped because she had pies in the oven for a fundraiser and human bodies must also eat. Mr. Dalton sent a photo of his cousin standing by a sign that said please keep quiet seated quietly next to a boy in a football shirt who was telling him a story and Mr. Dalton had written, patient in biro, you have turned my library loud and I can bear it.\n\nOne afternoon the river rose without drama, a slow, serious rising that made people frown at the sky for doing its job. The embankment took a small drink and then took more, and by morning the path knew the river too well. Rafi went to run and found himself at a new edge. He stood there like a child at a grown-up\u2019s party, hands in pockets, information his. Jim and Mavis arrived with the authority of regulars. They all looked at the water. Mavis regarded a floating twig as if it owed her money. Jim said they would give the river an hour and it would give them back the path, and Rafi thought how much of his new life had been like this\u2014waiting for something bigger than him to decide to recede. He did not run. He walked the long way round past houses he usually ignored and saw a boy who might have been Ty\u2019s brother teach a younger child to skip rope, and the rope licked the pavement like flame and no one got hurt. When he got home he had been walking long enough that his body had forgotten to want more, and he put the kettle on and found the metronome still ticking in his pocket and turned it off and did not feel guilty.\n\nThey took the piece to a prison because Kaia knew a man who knew a man who trusted her more than he trusted any email, and one day the ladder passed through a metal detector and the boxes got sniffed and Leah had to explain gaffer tape as if it were contraband mana. The men in the room had shoulders that had learned curriculum other rooms do not teach. The air smelt of bleach and longing. An officer with kind wrists told Rafi quietly which corners not to stand in and then stood near them anyway so he wouldn\u2019t have to be brave about it. Rafi did not make jokes about running. He ran small. He spoke the counts out loud because the room did not trust silence yet. He paused and felt the pause be the most dangerous and tender thing in the building. One man at the back stood abruptly and then sat again because he remembered rules about standing and not standing and his eyes were wet in the way eyes get when you are furious at them for betraying you. After, a man with tattoos like a family turned his palms up in a gesture older than laws and asked if it counted as running if you walked fast enough to forget your name. Rafi said, \u201cYes.\u201d Later, back home, when Maya asked him in the cautious way she reserved for new theatres whether it had gone all right, he said, \u201cYes,\u201d and meant yes in twenty directions.\n\nThere were arguments that did not blow walls down. He and Leah learned how to disagree about where a light should go without making the room colder. He and his father learned how to argue about agents without suggesting that love was conditional. Maya argued with a council person who had said the hall should raise its hire fee for \u201cprofessional work\u201d and she asked archly how the village would measure professionalism in a place that smelt of sponge cake and chalk, and the fee remained the same. He and Anita argued with his knee about how quickly it should trust and won some weeks and lost some. He and his body began to speak to each other less like enemies and more like business partners who admired each other\u2019s luck.\n\nOn a day when nothing remarkable happened\u2014no invitations, no money, no crisis, the best\u2014he walked to the allotments to borrow a spade for a thing that would later be called a set element and then, after it failed to look like anything except a spade, would be called a spade. He saw a notice about a summer fair in letters that had been painted by someone whose handwriting had an accent. He watched an old man and a younger woman argue delicately about compost and need and kindness. He stopped by the butcher where the man behind the counter always called him \u201cson\u201d in a tone that meant neither power nor possession, and he bought sausages because the body must have sausages sometimes even if it has an ethos and a metronome. He took them home and his mother pretended not to be delighted and then did that thing she did with onions that made summer meals taste like rain had never been invented.\n\nHe slept well that night. He dreamed of ladders that rose without permission and of floors that offered themselves like hosts. He woke to a morning that smelt of cut grass and toast and Maya\u2019s shampoo and the faint ghost of Yvonne\u2019s turmeric in a jar in the fridge. He ran a small loop because Anita had said he could and because his feet had made a contract with the Ouse as binding as a court makes. He saw Ty on the path with a friend and they pretended not to see each other until they had to, and then Ty asked about the prison in a way that made it clear he was asking about himself. He answered like a man who believed breath had to be earned, every day, willingly. He came home and the kettle sang the way kettles sing when mornings have been trained to be kind.\n\nThere would be other calls and letters and injuries and lifts in borrowed vans that rattled with ladders and resolve. There would be halls that smelt of bleach and hope and halls that smelt only of polish and biscuits. There would be nights when the metronome kept time without him and days when he left his phone in the drawer and suffered only the mild itch of missing everyone who had ever wanted anything from him. There would be a time, not far, when Leah would say \u201cwe need to decide if we are the kind of people who ask for money in advance,\u201d and they would try and not be bad at it. There would be, tomorrow, Anita reminding him that glutes are destiny and him pretending to be scandalised. There was, now, his mother with a crossword and his father with a fixed door and a pen that still had ink in it. There was the Ouse with its steam like second weather and the village with its curtains adjusting their familiarity. There was the piece, which was no longer a thing he had carried alone but a thing that had learned to be carried and had opinions about where it should go next. He put bread in the toaster and listened for the pop and found himself on the exact beat, and when he laughed, he tested his knee by accident, and the knee laughed too.Chapter 9\n\nBy June the air had learned to be warm without apologising. Brampton unpacked its summer in small confident gestures: washing lines strung like bunting between converted semis, a smell of cut grass that had the nerve to be nostalgic while it was still being made, children riding bikes in pairs as if physics preferred company. The summer fair appointed the recreation ground as its temporary capital. Men you only ever saw at funerals and f\u00eates hauled trestle tables into rows, arguing gently about right angles and gravy. The WI\u2019s Victoria sponges sat with the patient hauteur of queens who know they can be decapitated by a knife and still be adored. The brass band warmed up by trying out bits of four different songs at once, which in aggregate sounded like a factory testing itself; then, as if shamed by cacophony, they found a chord and the field turned its head.\n\nLeah had drawn a little diagram of the grass like a general planning an invasion and found a corner that would not interfere with the hoopla or the ferret racing. The ladder arrived under a tarpaulin to preserve what dignity a ladder can in public and Rafi\u2019s father arranged stakes as if he were pitching their tent on the moon. Ty and two of his friends had been persuaded into volunteer tee-shirts that made them look like they had been captured by an optimistic charity. They worked fast in the way boys do when work becomes game; one of them\u2014Joel, who had hair he had to keep adjusting because it had ideas of its own\u2014took possession of the gaffer tape with missionary zeal. Leah checked the sightlines, looked at the brass, looked at the clouds; she sniffed for rain and rehearsed the speech she would give it if it came. Maya had secured the tea tent under a marshalling system that would have fed an army without visible leadership and stood in the shade counting cups as if each were a tiny hymn.\n\nRafi walked the piece slowly, as he always did in new spaces, his feet writing letters the grass tried to forget immediately. Anita, who had accepted a slice of lemon drizzle as payment for three men telling her elaborate stories about their knees while she tried to drink her tea, watched him from under a hat borrowed from someone who had been to Goa once and kept a hat to prove it. She had signed off on his return to short runs, and he had been faithful to the metronome when he found it helpful and ignored it when he needed to feel human rather than measured. His father had fallen into the habit, one he tried and failed to make seem accidental, of coming for five minutes when Rafi set up and staying for forty, loitering near the ladder like a man pretending he didn\u2019t know his son would one day climb things with grace.\n\nOf course bunting attempted assassination. Leah had thought she had calculated wind, but bunting, like gossip, finds a draft. At the second run-through a burst of instructional jazz from the band sent a gust along the edge of a wonky gazebo; the string of flags wagged like a warning and then went possessive, wrapping one coloured mouth around the ladder\u2019s third rung. Ty lunged without thinking, Joel grabbed Ty\u2019s shirt to keep him a person rather than a story, and for a second Rafi saw ten possible outcomes and chose, by luck and Anita\u2019s insistence on midfoot, the one where no one\u2019s head met metal. The ladder rang, the flags unlooped in a fit of conscience, and everyone laughed the laugh human throats make to persuade bodies to be calmer than they deserve. The band, oblivious in a way that made Rafi 60% envious and 40% homicidal, completed their phrase and someone cried, \u201cEncore,\u201d in a voice made partly of beer.\n\nWhen he did the piece for the crowd, he did it stripped of the elements that pretended to be magic. It had no fog and less light and still managed to feel like a secret being told by a friend. The audience was a collection of neighbours who had chosen to stand in the sun for longer than was sensible. Babies dozed with their mouths lightly open like held musical notes. Teenagers pretended to be bored and staged their boredom six feet closer than usual. Jim was there, of course, Mavis leashed, the two of them looking as if the day had been invented to give them something to notice. When the ladder rose, the band, perhaps without meaning to, found the chord they\u2019d been reaching for all afternoon and the moment stowed itself away in people\u2019s bodies for later. Afterwards Rafi found grass stuck to his calf and an odd sense that he had been in a room with no walls; he wiped at the grass and told his father without looking, \u201cI didn\u2019t fall,\u201d and his father said, \u201cNo one asked you to jump,\u201d and then, almost at the same time, they both smiled like men who had shared a joke they would not waste by saying aloud too much.\n\nAt the stall where honesty boxes did brisk trade and dishonesty had the day off, an old coach from Loughborough approached with a hesitancy that either age or memory had given him. It wasn\u2019t Lo. It was the other one, from a year when Rafi had come to a track with numbers in his head and had left with the numbers redrawn. The man still had a stopwatch on his wrist like a stubborn watchman. He said Rafi\u2019s name with a question mark and then explained who he had been in case time had scrubbed the chalk lines of hierarchy from both their minds. He did not apologise. Men like him rarely apologise; they make observations and hope you will read the apology there. He said, \u201cYou found your way,\u201d and then, because he could not resist categorisation even now, asked, \u201cDo you think you\u2019re happy?\u201d Rafi had been prepared for judgement or a story that returned the old man to the centre of the lane. He had not been prepared for a question that had managed to shed most of its self-interest. He answered simply, because there are times to be plain. \u201cMore than I thought I would be when I was twenty-one,\u201d he said. The man nodded once, sharp, like a pencil being set against paper, and went to buy a slice of Battenberg as if sugar could move blood where apology would not go.\n\nLeah had been offered a commission before the fair, and it had sat in her bag all morning like a folded bird. A dance company in Leeds wanted a design for a piece about women and patience. They had said the words budget and time frame like people who were careful and brave, and Leah had spent an hour composing an email that would make it clear she was not going to be the kind of designer who tolerated purple unless it had earned it. Rafi found her behind the coconut shy peering at her phone with the intensity that suggests both delight and the start of trouble. She told him at once because she had learned, from months and a kitchen table, that the work only grew well if it was said out loud early. He said the thing he had had to learn to say when his bones insisted he protect himself from loss: \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cDo it. We\u2019ll grow the other bit like we\u2019ve been growing it: with tea and cardboard and other people\u2019s rooms. We can be both.\u201d The coconut shy man overheard and shouted, \u201cBoth!\u201d at the exact moment someone knocked a coconut into the grass and the stall let out a whoop that passed for approval.\n\nPracticality followed them home like a good-natured dog. They sat at the kitchen table and agreed, between porridge and emails and Maya\u2019s list of what could be frozen, that they would make themselves into a structure other people could understand and give money to. A very nice man at the council had used the letters C and I and C in a particular order and handed them a leaflet that smelled of seriousness. Community interest looked good on them; it was the description they had been fumbling for when asked, on forms that welcomed verbs and then punished their use, what they were for. They wrote a name down that made them both grin and then hesitate in case names were fragile. Leah tested Breath & Ladder out loud and the room did not object; Rafi tried Lanes & Ladders and hated the sibilance; Maya said she liked Ouse Right with a little laugh at her own audacity; in the end, because it was exactly halfway between earnest and silly, they chose Small Rooms Company and added, in small letters, and Wide Breaths so that the people who had been at the library would feel recognised. His father drew up a budget on squared paper like a man planning to tile, and when they told him he could be a director if he liked, he declined and then accepted because the word director sounded like a chair and he had always wanted to sit down for a living.\n\nAnita added a slow 10k to his plan. The point was not the time, she said, and then put a number on the paper that was roughly his time and he pretended not to see her trick. He hated the idea of a bib pinned to his shirt and a clock playing god and he agreed anyway because the event would raise money for the hall\u2019s new heaters and he had started to understand that personal ethos had to be porous enough to let other people in. They made it into a village thing so it would not swallow him; Jim raised his hand at a meeting in the back of the pub and volunteered to be in charge of signage, which meant that the route would be marked by bits of cardboard attached to lampposts at shoulder height for a man who had broken mass-produced measures into pieces and preferred his own. Ty and Joel ran two miles and walked one and then, without confessing it counted, ran another. Rafi\u2019s father refused to be timed and walked with the man from the butcher, the two of them discussing the politics of mince. Maya walked the last hundred metres diagonally because she refused to be shepherded by tape and the finish line judge, who had been told her job mattered, tried to scowl at her and could not. Rafi found himself at a pace that let him see faces and road and the sky, and finished upright with his knee unmutinied and his chest warm with the ordinary human ache of doing something you could do without harm.\n\nKaia\u2019s voice arrived through a phone and also, increasingly, in person with cake. The festival had outgrown its original name without noticing and was now a quilt of places and people\u2014library corners, school halls, a skate park that insisted on being part of the arts whether anyone liked it or not. She asked Rafi and Leah if they would curate a strand. Curate sounded like a word that required hats; they said yes because what it mostly meant in Kaia\u2019s mouth was, \u201cChoose people you want to listen to and then make other people listen to them too.\u201d They sat with lists and thought of a woman whose hands told jokes before her mouth did, and a man who played a hurdy-gurdy as if the machine had modern feelings, and a boy who could make mathematics on a whiteboard sound like jazz. Rafi discovered that inviting is a kind of art, and also that cancelling is too, because a mime got a gig in Spain that would pay for his sister\u2019s operation and they had to find someone in a day who could hold quiet like water; he learned to breathe around other people\u2019s emergencies and his own instinct to solve what should only be held.\n\nThe first proper stumble belonged to Ty. Trouble is rarely a lion; it\u2019s a wasp you ignore until your thigh wears it. He didn\u2019t arrive at three on a Thursday. He did not message. Leah, who had taken to assuming the best because it kept the room warmer, waited until twenty past and then sent a line that sounded like a joke and was not. Rafi\u2019s gut did its old twist, the one that sat behind his belly button and listened for the squeal of brakes. Ty turned up Saturday with an apology that had been made brittle by another adult\u2019s voice somewhere else. He had been stopped with a friend by a man in a store who took boys with hoods to be a pair rather than two. There had been an argument that could have been a cautionary tale and was, in the end, just an argument with a notice attached in biro to his day. He had the shaky look of a person who did not want his mouth to open because if it did it might let water out. Rafi did not give him a speech. He gave him the ladder and told him to check the bolts, an act of trust that worked on things and people both. Leah made tea like it was a ribbon you could pull through a knot. They sat late after the hall had emptied and Ty told them, skirting detail as if it were a puddle, about his nan who had not left the sofa for days when the news was bad, and about a teacher who had said his name gently once and then never again, and about the small nobility of not doing something terrible when your body is insisting that velocity is the only salve. Rafi\u2019s father found out, because mothers and halls tell fathers the things proper pride tries to hide, and he turned up Monday morning with a toolbox and asked Ty to help him make a trolley hook fit the ladder. Ty learned to drill in a way that would not put more holes in the universe than necessary and the next time the man in the hardware gave them discount, he did it looking at Ty like they had both agreed to be surprised.\n\nRosanna\u2019s email was both courteous and, as always, late. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking of a \u2018where are they now,\u2019\u201d she wrote, and he could hear the line producer\u2019s chaos in the white space between her words. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing, we\u2019d love to point a camera at you that isn\u2019t purple.\u201d He would have said no if it were the old show, the one with glitter that climbed into your hair and slept there, but Rosanna came with a history of saying the right thing when no one was listening and following through anyway. He sent a list back like someone who had finally learned to use asking not as a weapon but as a sieve: the library, the hall, Anita\u2019s clinic if she was willing, Yvonne\u2019s canteen for the stew and the laugh, Flo if she could be coaxed off another show into daylight. Rosanna said yes to all of it in three emails he could tell had been typed while walking. The crew came with equipment that made the hall feel small and important. They filmed Rafi and Leah chalking without asking what possessed them to still use chalk. They filmed Ty choosing tape and being in the room without performing being in the room. They filmed Anita explaining knees to a camera in the exact same tone she had explained them to Rafi and the cameraman rubbed his knee afterwards without knowing why. Yvonne talked them into thirds at the table and delivered to camera a sermon on eating that made the sound man look like he had remembered his grandmother in Karachi telling him off with love. Flo stood in the doorway, taped off a square of floor because sometimes ritual needs to be literal, and spoke two sentences about safety that had four different kinds of love in them if you had a good ear.\n\nThe cut, when it aired, was decent. There were still shots of his face that made him want to punch the person who had decided to pause on that frame, but the rooms had won. The library\u2019s silence and then its chosen noise did their work. The village hall looked like the kind of place sensible people love without saying so in case someone raises the rent. The internet did as it does\u2014spat, sang, remembered, forgot\u2014and in the middle of it there were messages from people who had also found breath in small rooms and would like to find it again. Maya watched with a cushion, habit not broken by familiarity. His father pretended he was doing something with screws and then laughed too loud at a joke that wasn\u2019t one. Leah took his hand and squeezed once at the moment where the ladder rose and the camera did not add thunder, and he discovered that the simplest thing compliments can do is show up in the right amount at the right time and no more.\n\nThey took the piece to the river that month because it had been asking. The council approved it with a paragraph about safety that made Leah grateful and Rafi smug. They chose dusk because some things should not be attempted at noon. Flo came even without being paid\u2014later she and Leah would argue in good humour about that\u2014and put cones where cones would do more than brand a space. People arrived with jackets though it was warm, because English skin never trusts a day\u2019s kindness. The Ouse pretended to be still the way dogs pretend. Bats stitched the sky with the neatness of small intent. The ladder, placed on the embankment this time, learned a new humility; water changes objects and asks them to become their outlines rather than their bulk. A boy no taller than the ladder\u2019s first rung made a beeline for it because human is human, and Ty stepped in with a hand on his shoulder that was soft as a stop sign. The boy allowed himself to be turned aside and believed for a second that he had allowed it; Rafi loved them both for the negotiation. He ran along the rubber of the path and onto the grass and let the piece do what it did when space is more than room. When the ladder rose the surface of the river took a long celebratory breath and made a copy of the rung that shook a little, as if the water shared a sense of humour with the wind. Someone on the far bank whistled. Someone nearer sang one note without meaning to and then, embarrassed, stopped. It was enough.\n\nAfterwards, Jim told him a story about his wife he had not told anyone else in this town. It involved a ladder that was not metaphorical and an argument about whether she should be allowed to paint the second storey of a house she had decided was shabby in a way that hurt her feelings. Jim had refused her, on the sensible grounds that bodies fall, and she had gone up anyway because she despised shabby more than gravity. She had not fallen. She had waved down at him triumphantly, and then a gust had reminded her that even the triumphant have to come down with steadiness, and in the coming down they had learned, in one short ragged minute, about patience together. He handed Rafi a collar then, Mavis\u2019s first when she had been small and the world bigger, old leather softened to the point of memory. \u201cFor the back of the stage,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you remember to go gentle even when going clever.\u201d Rafi promised the collar a nail and the future a nod.\n\nThere were days of pure administration thick as custard. The CIC paperwork ate an afternoon and left grease on their fingers anyway. They chose a bank with less suspicion than was wise because the woman behind the counter had lashes that felt honest. Insurance asked new questions that suggested someone had sent a memo about creative risk from an office with no chairs. Leah began a spreadsheet and startled herself by loving it. Rafi learned to say invoice without grimacing and to write the words \u201cpro bono\u201d on a line and not feel like he had set himself on fire. The word \u201ctour\u201d lost its glamour and grew a spine and still felt like a word worth pushing.\n\nOn a Tuesday when the hall felt especially like a church and a shed, Leah kissed him without workshop lighting or borrowed applause. She had been moving a lamp, then stopped moving it, then forgot she had meant to find a better angle, and he was leaning against the stage in the way that meant his knee was behaving and his head was full of lists. It didn\u2019t feel like a confession or a line in a longer piece; it felt like discovering that breath has texture in winter. They did not ruin it with questions about always. They did not write it on paper. They did what people do when the world is large and the kitchen is small\u2014they made tea and talked about nothing for fifteen minutes and then went back to placing tape because love is rarely glamorous when it is useful.\n\nAnita added jumps back in small rude parcels like a teacher handing back homework with a smirk. He argued his way down from five to three and she let him win because it didn\u2019t matter and would make him obedient about something that did. The metronome, insulted, flirted with his pockets anyway. His run routes widened by half fields at a time. He found himself keeping company with a fox one morning, the animal floating along the hedgerow with that air foxes have of understanding bureaucracy and rejecting it. He ran past a man teaching a small child to fly a kite in a wind that was technically there and practically not, and the child accepted this as a triumph. He stopped on the bridge and leaned over and saw a yellow bucket lodged under the bank like proof that even plastic wanted a quiet life sometimes.\n\nOn a Thursday that smelt of rain but was not yet wet, Ty\u2019s nan came to the hall. She had on a cardigan with bobbles and the kind of handbag every British woman seems to acquire at fifty. She had made mango pickle that would have caused a diplomatic incident if it had been shown to certain delicate palates. She gave it to Maya with instructions Maya pretended not to know already, and then she sat and watched her grandson lift a box in the right way. She said almost nothing. When she left, she patted Rafi\u2019s hand twice in the way hands do when they are choosing thrift with their words. The next day Ty turned up early and asked, in the tone of someone trying to convince himself this question had occurred to him before he slept, \u201cIs there a thing like this I could learn to do, like, as a job?\u201d Rafi had been waiting for the question since he\u2019d met him and did not show Ty the joy and panic it produced. He said, too casually, that people paid other people to make things safe and visible, that there were courses where you learned to wrangle light or ladders or people, that being the one with the tape could be a life. Leah, who had already Googled three courses and written down the open days, said, \u201cLet\u2019s start with shadowing. Then let\u2019s start with emails. You don\u2019t have to say please to anything except deadlines.\u201d\n\nThat night, when the field behind the hall had finally been persuaded by hay-making to smell like childhood, they put on their coats and went to the embankment without agreeing to. The Perseids had been promised and like all promised things in England came later than advertised. They lay on the slope like children and tried to call stars by names they would answer to. The meteor shower was less a shower and more the occasional streak that made you question whether your eye was inventing. That was fine; they had come for the excuse to look up. They talked about how long they could do small if small stayed interesting. They talked about rooms that were trying to find them and rooms they were trying to find. They talked about how many ladders a person should own and whether flares counted as pyro and Leah said yes and Rafi said no and it was not a dealbreaker. Leah\u2019s head found his shoulder and stayed there until the damp suggested home. They stood and flicked grass from each other\u2019s backs and made promises they did not speak, which are sometimes the only kind worth making.\n\nThey declared, the next week, a Sabbath of feet. They cancelled a showing without shame and wrote on the hall door a note explaining that rest is part of all good training plans. They put their phones in a drawer and let them sulk. They walked to the shop for milk as if the milk were in another country and found on the way three people they loved and two they avoided because even rest days must include reality. They sat in the garden with their toes out and watched the sky make a good-faith effort at blue. Maya brought out tea and pretended to forget to bring out biscuits so that they would have to come inside and talk to her for a minute. His father oiled the trolley wheels because idleness is a sin to some and a gift to others and he was not ready to join the latter.\n\nAt the end of the rest day, the kind of quiet tiredness that is different from exhaustion settled over his body like a blanket properly tucked. He lay in bed aware of the heat left by the day. Somewhere outside a fox considered bins with philosophical seriousness. He thought of the library with Mr. Dalton\u2019s signs that had been moved and his slightly affronted face; of the prison where a man had learned that raising your hand did not always cost you; of Kaia\u2019s kitchen where pies were made into programming; of Anita\u2019s gel and metronome and hands that left his knee better than they had found it; of Flo\u2019s tape like a boundary and a blessing; of Yvonne\u2019s jars with their labels like small graffiti on a generous wall; of the river making a mirror for his risk and being kind about it. He thought about the scribbled paper where strangers had left their breath stories and realised he was becoming the keeper of other people\u2019s little truths.\n\nBefore he slept, he wrote one sentence on the whiteboard Leah had fixed to the kitchen wall for lists and poems and rats of genius that scuttled at night. He wrote it slowly so as not to wake anything fragile. Keep it small and bright. In the morning Maya would underline it once and his father would circle the word bright with a small arrow that pointed to the window and Leah would draw a ladder so tiny you could almost climb it with a fingertip. Then the mist would come off the Ouse as if it had been invented brand new and they would lace their shoes and go to the hall where chalk made its constellations and people became brave at the same time with the same air.",

He had run that path so often that even his feet seemed to know the bends and the ruts by a private memory. Over the low pedestrian bridge behind the village hall, past the hedge that kept trying to grow into the lane, under the glare of a sky that couldn't decide whether to be grey forever or crack and show some blue. Brampton was still half-asleep, curtains not yet drawn, newspaper man whistling low as he folded the Hunts Post through letter boxes. The grass along the embankment listened for him and gave way. Rafi leaned forward and let his lungs climb hot.\n\nHe ran as a way of holding himself together. Some people stitched quilts, some kept notebooks of birds; Rafi laced trainers and counted the tempo of his footfalls like the beat of a song that could not end. He liked how the world simplified when he moved quickly, cutting it into breath-sized pieces. There were days he counted his worries as lampposts and left them behind like the morning\u2019s litter.\n\nOn that morning, his breath visible in the sharp air, he saw the old man with the terrier again. They had shared nods for months and never a word. Today, the terrier's coat wore frost and its nose was a sawdust pink. The man raised a hand anyway. Rafi lifted his fingers off his gloves in the wet, quick British style of greeting reserved for people you don't know but see always. And kept going.\n\nHe turned back at the mound of earth where someone had half-started to plant a hedge and never finished. He made a private map of the village: where he had once tripped when he was fifteen and knocked out his two front teeth, where a girl had kissed him at dusk and it had been more gentle than he'd guessed, where he had shouted at his dad on the footpath and then wanted to swallow his words back like old gum. Each corner was a story. He ran through his own book every morning, footnote after footnote. He was twenty-six now. He could feel the oldness trying to settle around the edges, and he outran it as long as he could.\n\nHe timed his finish so he could heat the kettle for his mother before she came down. Habit. The front door stuck like a living thing that did not want to be woken. He shouldered it. The hallway smelled of damp wool and the faint ghosts of cumin. The house wasn't large; the light had to take a breath before it reached the far corners. On the fridge, the pinboard held doctor's letters and charity flyers, and a Polaroid from when his dad had decided a photo with the old Peugeot was something families did.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d his mother said, even though she hadn't seen him yet. Her voice came from the top of the stairs, then her feet eased down each step with the care of someone negotiating a price. Maya had a cardigan for every month and a scarf for every cardigan. Today\u2019s was cerulean, a little frayed. She wore house shoes that made her look like a neat little boat. She touched her son's shoulder as she passed him on the way to her chair. \u201cTea,\u201d she added, unnecessary and affectionate both.\n\n\u201cAlready thinking of it,\u201d Rafi said. His hair still held the cold outside, and tiny drops flecked his eyelashes where the fog had settled. He rubbed his hands on a towel that always seemed to need washing no matter how many times it was washed.\n\n\u201cYou were gone long,\u201d she said, settling into her chair like a landing bird.\n\n\u201cI added the loop.\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn't your knee\u2014\u201d she began.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he said, quick enough to make her smile to herself at how children grew old but not old enough that they stopped cutting their mothers off in the name of their own bodies. He set the kettle and stared at it as if watching could make it boil faster.\n\nThey ate porridge, which his mother salted lightly before she remembered he preferred honey. She reached for the honey and he laughed and took it, and they were quiet then in that way that belongs to people who have known each other\u2019s mornings for decades. In the middle of that quiet, Rafi's phone hummed.\n\nHe didn't look at it.\n\n\u201cYou're not looking?\u201d Maya said, because she herself could not resist checking a message as if it might change the planet\u2019s spin.\n\n\u201cNot yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cMust be important to hum,\u201d she said.\n\nHe thought of the email he had sent two months ago that still had not received a reply, about work at the new distribution centre. He thought of the message he had written and rewritten to the producers of that show. He had auditioned in Manchester on an impulse and then pretended to forget he had done it. He had walked onto a stage lined with tape and shadows and zoomed lens, and tried to explain to a room of strangers how a running routine could be a thing people watched. He had lined up boxes and hurdles and he had leapt them to music, and he'd told a story with his body about leaving and returning, about not being able to breathe and finding breath again. He had called it \u201cA Mile of There and Back.\u201d He had looked at his trainers and thought of how they'd moved through nights that would otherwise have been sleepless, nights thick with what-ifs about his dad and regrets and the day he\u2019d allowed a coach to tell him he wasn't enough for a place at Loughborough.\n\nHe didn't know what to make of having done a television thing. Simon had said, interestingly and with less of the arched eyebrow than usual, that he'd never seen a runner who made the stage look like a city and a track both. Amanda had called it \u201cmodern, in a way,\u201d and someone on the production team had asked him to stay after and talk about lighting for it. He had been voted through to the semis on a knife's edge, then lost out to a choir in coordinated blue, because a choir is what Sundays love.\n\nHe checked his phone only when his mother sighed theatrically. The message was there. It had the subject line with more caps than civilised people use.\n\nRAF, CALL US WHEN YOU CAN. URGENT.\n\nHe looked at the word RAF and at the sender's name, which, to his tired eyes, looked like a misinterpretation of his own name. He wiped his thumb on his shorts, just in case his skin could smudge the meaning.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Maya said, catching the change in his posture.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s from the show,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat show?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe show,\u201d he said, and then he laughed at himself for how he didn't say the name as though it were some old superstition, like not whistling in the house. He pressed the call button. His heart had brought a drum into his chest without consulting him. As it rang, he saw himself, absurdly, reflected in the kettle\u2019s chrome, and he was small and full of steam.\n\n\u201cRafi? Hi, it\u2019s Rosanna from production,\u201d the voice said. Bright, clipped, with a tiredness well hidden but there if your ear was trained for it.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, and tasted salt where the air had cracked his lips.\n\n\u201cCan you talk?\u201d she asked in that way that sounds like a test more than a question.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he repeated. He glanced at his mother, who had put down her spoon and was leaning into the phone from across the room as if proximity could translate into understanding.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be bringing you back,\u201d Rosanna said. \u201cFor the final. There's been discussion, you know, lively, about wildcards. We wanted the ideas to be broader this year, not just singing and the usual, and your piece caught fire online after your semi-final. Not to make your head explode, but two million views and a lot of comments about the way you\u2014\u201d she paused, possibly looking for a word that wasn't \u201clooked sweaty.\u201d \u201cThe way you told a story. We would love you to come back.\u201d\n\nThe kettle had boiled, then the click of it suddenly was like a punctuation mark he wanted to underline. Rafi did not speak right away. He had made himself a rule when he was younger: never believe good news on the first read. It was born of counting times that initial elation had gone the way of sugar in tea, gone grain by grain with stirring.\n\n\u201cFor the final,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYes. We know it\u2019s short notice. There\u2019s a wrinkle: we'll need you to work on a version that suits the live finale stage\u2014 bigger, different shapes, fire regulations, you know. We can help you with the design. But\u2014\u201d she must have heard something in the silence \u201c\u2014if you're worried about what's involved, we can walk it through. We'd like to lock this by this evening.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mum\u2019s listening,\u201d he said, and regretted it immediately like a child who confesses to a teacher that his mother is in the audience.\n\n\u201cSay hi to Mum,\u201d Rosanna said, unfazed. \u201cCongratulations. Everyone in our office is really excited to have you. And, Rafi? There's another bit. The union can handle a per diem, and we'll put you up. Do you have a manager, anyone we should be liaising with?\u201d\n\nHe laughed. It came out unexpectedly high. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNo manager. Just me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay. I'll send a contract and a schedule. I have to jump, but call me when you've read it. Welcome back.\u201d\n\nThey went through the usual phone polite and then he hung up and looked at his mother. Her hands had gone to her mouth even though she did not yet know what to say. She came up out of her chair faster than Rafi had seen her move in weeks.\n\n\u201cThe final,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want me.\u201d\n\nShe hugged him. She smelled of soap and the faintest shadow of perfume she had worn in 1992. He held her as if, somehow, he was keeping the piece of good news from blowing out the open window.\n\nWhen his father called, as if some secret village telegraph had rung him, Rafi had to leave the room because the kitchen could not hold both that voice and his own surprise. He took his phone into the hallway where the floorboards had curves like someone had stored waves there. \u201cKid,\u201d his father said, a name he used regardless of age. \u201cAmanda Holden will be talking about our name.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a show,\u201d Rafi said, which was what he was meant to say. It is never just a show. His father had an almost religious belief in the power of British television to hand out miracles once a week. People were always winning money or proposing to each other or finding a lost cousin in a cupboard. \u201cI still have to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we will be watching,\u201d his father said. \u201cYour aunty in Luton already knows. Don't ask how.\u201d\n\nWhen he went to work at the shop, he told no one. In the mirror of the staff toilet he tried to practice the shrug he would use when people asked. He couldn't get it right. His own face kept giving him away. He stacked shelves of cereal with an earnestness his boss, Vince, called \"religious\", and he forgot the prices of things he'd known for months, and at one point he lined up six jam jars in a row like trophies.\n\nIn the afternoon, Leah came in. He had known she would. They had a text language of ellipses and gifs that said more than calling did. She was wearing the red beanie that made her look like a cartoon burglar. She was carrying her bike helmet in her left hand and two croissants in her right, as if she had crashed a French breakfast.\n\n\u201cYou're famous,\u201d she whispered across the fruit aisle, but the whisper turned cartwheely.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said, but smiling.\n\n\u201cFinal,\u201d she said. \u201cFinal. Do you know what that means? We have to make a thing. We have to go big. Are you going to jump off a car? Can you do that? No, that's not legal. What if we played with the light more? That first bit where your shadow looks like it leaves you\u2014\u201d\n\nHe put a finger to his lips. \u201cI'm in a shop,\u201d he said to remind her, as if the stacks of tins weren't evidence enough. \u201cDon't get me fired on the day this happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cVince will forgive you,\u201d she said, and then Vince materialised with a trolley and said, \u201cForgive him for what?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Rafi said, and dropped a packet of spaghetti that then exploded into its life in the aisle.\n\n\u201cNothing?\u201d Vince said, sweeping a hand over the mess in a generous imitation of an Italian man in films. \u201cThis spaghetti survived a factory and a lorry and one very bored teenager lifting it, and you, Rafi, have defeated it.\u201d\n\nLeah snorted into her croissant. \u201cI\u2019m going to cry,\u201d she said, which made Vince blink twice as if he had stumbled into a theatre he hadn\u2019t paid for. She turned toward the door, then back again. She caught Rafi's eye and mouthed: tonight? The videos? He nodded. She raised her croissant like a baton, then left in a gust of cool air and tiny flakes of pastry that were too light to get in trouble.\n\nRosanna's email arrived at four. He read it on his phone in the stockroom, perched on a crate of toilet rolls like a scholar reading a letter from a long-dead poet. The schedule was both a military operation and a suggestion. Rehearsal slots. Camera rehearsals. A health and safety session which, he noted, was bolded. A meal plan. He liked to cook his own, he always had, but there was a line item that read: canteen access available, dietary requirements to be logged, contact Yvonne. The contract was in PDF. He downloaded it and saw his name spelled correctly four times and once as Rafl. He forgave them. He sent it to Leah. He sent it to his father, who replied with eight clapping hands, four fire emojis, then \u201cwhat does this part mean,\u201d beneath a clause about exclusivity periods.\n\nWhen his shift ended, he walked home slower than he had run that morning. The light was yellow and then it remembered winter was not yet done and went grey again. He could feel the house pulling him like a magnet. He liked to arrive at his kitchen with sweat and leave it to his mother to make a small fuss; he liked to be someone's good thing at the end of a day. He would be away now. He thought of his mother folding him into a large city in her quiet mind and trying not to worry.\n\nThey ate dinner at the narrow table; he cooked. He made dal with the lentils his aunt had sent from Pakistan because she believed England did not grow proper lentils. He made rice and added cardamom pods he\u2019d learned, only last year, change everything. He chopped spinach and let it sag into the pan with the slowly contented sound of something coming to itself. His mother set the plates with that mixture of ceremony and practicality she inherited from her own mother: you feed someone as if the day has been hard. She listened to him talk about the schedule and asked questions for the sake of having him tell her everything twice.\n\n\u201cYou'll have to eat,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI always eat,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou'll have to be careful,\u201d she added, looking at him in that layered way that mothers look\u2014 seeing his future, seeing his earlier baby self and the teenager who refused to drink milk for a year. \u201cRemember Manchester? That girl's chicken salad?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was tuna,\u201d he said. It had not been tuna. He had eaten something and had been sick for thirty hours and had promised himself sternly that he would never leave himself at the mercy of a backstage canteen again, that he would bring jars and Tupperware and utensils. He had a tiny stove he took when he travelled, the kind backpackers use. He had felt ridiculous the first time he'd boiled rice in a hotel room mug, then utterly vindicated when the others had eaten grey pasta at midnight and regretted living at three.\n\n\u201cI'll be careful,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter dinner, Leah came with her laptop and their rehearsal footage. Their rehearsal space was the allotment car park after dark. That was the truth of it. He had learned to imagine the chalk lines on the asphalt into a stage. He had taught his body to believe in invisible walls. Leah filmed with a steady hand. They watched the clips and stopped them where his foot had landed early or where the cut gave the wrong angle to the move where he vaulted and let the audience think he would not make the second step but then did.\n\n\u201cThere,\u201d Leah said and tapped the screen. \u201cThat. Keep that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u201d was small. It was the way his shoulders softened and then rolled forward before he pivoted, like a secret door in a crowded room. He had not known it would play like that until he saw it now. He tried to pretend not to smile, failed, then smiled at his failure and the room warmed.\n\n\u201cBig stage,\u201d Leah said. \u201cYou could put a ladder that rises, like it shouldn't, in a way. Or people. Two people, moving obstacles. That will be the trick: get the audience to feel the panic of lanes closing and then the relief when you find the line.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople get hurt.\u201d He wanted to say: I get hurt. He wanted to say: I always have to make sure no one else gets hurt in my stories because sometimes people in my life did. The thought made him glance at the photo on the windowsill, his father with his hand on Rafi's shoulder the day of the tiny school race he had won. His father had shouted \u201cgo\u201d louder than the starting gun.\n\n\u201cIf we manage it, nothing bad happens,\u201d Leah said, as if it were both a guarantee and a prayer.\n\nShe sketched on a pad, not to scale, boxes and arrows. \u201cWe can fake ten times. Do we know where this is? The final stage.\u201d\n\n\u201cHammersmith, I think,\u201d he said. \u201cOr the new place they use now. Rosanna said shape different.\u201d\n\n\u201cShape different,\u201d Leah repeated, and wrote it down like it was an instruction from a deity.\n\nHe answered his phone twice that evening, both times to producers. One was Yvonne from canteen who said, \u201cAllergies?\u201d and he heard her typing, the sound like rain in quality. He told her he wasn't allergic but liked to avoid anything new on performance days, like restaurants you don't know that still have warm seats from the last person. There was another man, Mike, who asked about footwear because apparently a pyrotechnics team was involved in something backstage and certain plastics were a no. He said \u201ctrainers\u201d and the man said \u201cbrand?\u201d and he said it and the man hummed in a way that suggested pleasing an unseen insurance company.\n\nHe packed late. He put his good things in a bag that had been to hostels and once to a strange party where he had borrowed someone's coat to feel like he belonged. He folded like a person trying to fold a future into cotton. He took oats, a small jar of ghee his mother swore by, tea bags because every tea office except theirs brewed too weak, and the tiny stove. He put in a headtorch because he was someone who put headtorches in things. He took the photo of his father and him, even though he wasn't that person, then took it out again because he didn\u2019t want to be that person.\n\nHe went to bed and could not sleep. He lay with the ceiling close enough to touch and thought of that first time he had run. Not the first time he moved quickly as a child, which had just been a blur of knees. The first time he made it a thing with numbers and intention and a finish line. He had left the house after dinner and run to the end of the road and then to the bridge and then further because the body loves being asked to do a bit more than last time. He had returned with his lungs like bells and had told no one because he didn't know that sharing it would be safe. Over time, he had found people to share with. Leah. His mum, with her delicate questions. A coach who had told him on a Tuesday in November that he could try for a university spot if he could find a second and a half. He had not found that second and a half. He had found, instead, people on a TV show asking him to do something stranger: to make the distance inside his mind visible to a crowd.\n\nHe fell asleep in the last hour before his alarm, and when it pulled him up, he felt like he had been dragged by his ankles from a river. He made coffee strong enough to make the kitchen smell like a memory of a place with sun. He sat with Maya and they did the crossword with their usual division of labour: he did the long answers and she filled the small boxes with surprising words. She worried over his train. He told her, not unkindly, that he was a grown man. She said, not unkindly, \u201cYou have never been a grown man to me,\u201d and he stood and gathered his bag and hugged her again at the doorway, a hug that lasted a fraction too long for comfort and exactly as long as they both needed.\n\nOn the train to London, he found a seat by the window. The river ran alongside for a while, pretending to be lazy. He thought about the city as a place with too many rooms where decisions were made. He had a notebook open on his lap, pen ready. He wrote: shape different. He wrote: a ladder that rises like a secret. He wrote: a moment where the audience thinks I'm finished and I am not. He wrote, then he crossed it out: do not fall. And then, because he had learned from experience that he had to be polite to fear, he wrote underneath it: you can fall and get back up if you need. He wrote his mother's name. He wrote the word \u201cBrampton\u201d as if he had to make sure it would still exist when he returned.\n\nThe studio was a warehouse that had been reborn as a cathedral of light. As he entered, he could see the weight of the ceiling and the anxiety of the walls. There were signs everywhere: STAGE THIS WAY, FOGGER ON, QUIET ZONE. There were people wearing headsets who moved as if the traffic of their ears was more important than the actual floor. He saw the paper with his name on it, taped to a door that led to a room where a kettle waited and a sofa that had seen better upholstery but still wanted to be kind. Someone had printed the paper too small. He loved them for that. He pinned it, this tiny error, as something to touch later when the minutes grew long. He put his bag down like he was checking in a memory with a cloakroom attendant.\n\nRosanna found him. She had hair that refused to be pinned tidy, which gave him comfort. \u201cThere you are,\u201d she said. \u201cHome safe?\u201d\n\nHe didn't know if she meant the room or London or television. \u201cYes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe'll walk to stage in a moment,\u201d she said. \u201cNot to terrify you, but it's a beast. You'll want your footing. We've had three people slip this week and one break a heel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not wearing heels,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cShame,\u201d she said, and he liked her in that moment more than he had on the phone. \u201cFood is down the corridor. Yvonne is a saint with a clipboard. She has your details. We\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d\n\nShe said we'll keep you safe as if it meant both physical and the other kind, the kind the old producers know about, the kind where you don't get eaten by attention. He appreciated that, or maybe he just needed to hear it and so he heard it.\n\nHe met the other acts in glances and fragments. A magician whose hands shook when he wasn't performing and became stone when he was. A fourteen-year-old singer whose mother was every inch of a mother you\u2019ve seen in television shows about mothers. A comedian who shook his hand with too much grip, registered his lack of white trousers as a personal affront, and then told him he loved his work. A dog. There is always a dog. He met a violinist who practised scales in a corner until the room tasted of resin. He tried to look like someone who belonged with them and also like someone who could leave at any moment, which is a strange posture.\n\nYvonne did have a clipboard. She ticked when he said his name and nodded when he said \u201cno allergies\u201d in a manner that implied she had heard everything. She promised him rice and chicken not complicated and warned that on show night the canteen turned into a war zone with napkins. He told her he had his own food for the day. She shrugged and said, with the cool of a ship's cook who'd seen storms swallow lesser men, \u201cSuit yourself, love.\u201d\n\nRosanna took him to the stage. The path to it was a river of cable and gaffer tape. The last corner turned and there it was: a skeleton under light. Bigger than the allotment car park. Bigger than his idea of what the body could own. The set was black and then not black where the lights tested their colours. The floor had marks like a map\u2014 Xs and arrows and circles that meant something to someone. The judges' desk was in the distance like the prow of ship. The audience's stands were empty now and still had a hungering silence, as if people had left their breath in their seats.\n\nHe stepped onto the floor slowly because this was the kind of place you didn't rush. He walked it with Rosanna, who pointed at places and said, \u201ccamera here,\u201d and \u201cwe'll have a runner\u2014 a stage runner, not you\u2014 bring this piece on,\u201d and \u201cthe pyro is behind that. Don't go back there unless dressed in metal.\u201d He learned the distances. He measured in strides, then in seconds. He felt, oddly, that he could feel the ghosts of other acts in the floor. A million small scuffs. He bent and touched it with the back of his hand like a superstitious footballer, then stood quickly in case anyone had seen.\n\n\u201cBreathe,\u201d Rosanna said, which he only then realised he had not been doing properly.\n\nHe thought of Leah, who would be practicing with tea on his mother's table, running her finger along the sketches. He thought of the terrier on the embankment and the old man's hand lifting and whatever home meant, exactly, when the world was this wide and askew.\n\n\u201cThere's a media session,\u201d Rosanna said, checking her phone for the time.\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say anything you'd be embarrassed to read on the front of the paper tomorrow.\u201d\n\nHe smiled. \u201cI don't say anything,\u201d he said, and she laughed, then said, \u201cYes. That.\u201d\n\nHe rehearsed until the lights grew less foreign. He set his boxes where they were allowed. His body learned the space like a new language. The first few runs were clumsy. He corrected. He corrected again. He surprised himself with a jump he had not planned and Leah wasn't there to tell him if it worked on camera, so he imagined her saying \u201cthere\u201d and kept it. Midway through, he felt that light, specific ache that meant he was building something in the air. He could see the piece in his head, that imaginary line that connects beginning to end. He could feel where he wanted to break it and then heal it as the music did the same.\n\nA boy in black trousers brought him water and said, \u201cBig fan,\u201d and blushed to his ears after he'd said it, and Rafi wanted to say something wise but only managed, \u201cThanks.\u201d He drank like he had always been thirsty.\n\nHe checked his bag in the room again, then went to find Leah in his phone. He sent her a photo of the stage and the words: shape very different. She replied with a photo of their kitchen, with the caption: empire central. His mother had added sambal to waiting bowls. They would not let him starve. He smiled and the soundstage turned a fraction less cold. He had not then, not yet, learned the way a place can change its face when the lights are up and the people arrive and the clock is ticking toward live. He did not know yet about the canteen as a village, the corners where whispers go to reproduce, the eyes that follow, the mouths that say good luck and mean a little less than the words. He did not know yet about the lunch. He did not know yet the weight of a twist of the gut at the wrong time, or the relief of being told this is your mark by someone who believes in you, or how thin the air is at the top of something you have wanted for years.\n\nFor now, the room with his name too small on its door was still his. The boxes were still just boxes. He called his mother and listened to her tell him to tie his laces properly, even though he had long changed to a different kind of shoe that didn't tie anymore. He let her fuss. He could be large later. Here, now, in the unglamorous minute before things began, he could be the boy who had returned with wet hair and worn socks and found, on a table, a bowl of hot dal and a spoon and someone to say, Sit, tell me how far you went. He could be, fully, a person not yet seen by a million pairs of eyes. He could love the emptiness of the seats and promise them gently that he would be worth filling.\n\nNight came earlier in that warehouse. The sky outside did what skies do. Inside, the lights took over. Yvonne's stews warmed the air in ordinary ways. Somewhere a dog barked the bark of a star. Somewhere a producer sighed in a way that meant a camera had gone wrong. Rafi laced and unlaced his shoes for no reason. He walked the corridors that looped back on themselves like thought. He passed the canteen twice and waved to the man with the tattoo of a rose that peered from his collar like a witness. He promised himself he would not eat anything he didn't trust. He promised himself he would be ferocious and gentle in equal measure. He promised himself he would remember to look up, find a face in the crowd, and then the next and the next. He promised before he had to break anything, or fix it, or be broken himself. He promised, and the building held him to it.",

The hotel was the kind that wrapped you in beige in the name of calm and gave you a view of the backside of another hotel, which felt both comic and appropriate. He lay still and listened to the hum of the corridor and the odd, small noises that happen when a building full of strangers puts on its day\u2014showers finding hot, doors kissed closed with the soft violence of the chain catch, a room-service trolley going about its pastoral duty. He missed the way Brampton had a silence that wasn't empty but was filled with things that minded their business. He pulled on his kit and went to run anyway, because the map inside him demanded it.\n\nOutside, the city offered him a canal in lieu of a river, and men in fluorescent jackets launching their mornings on little barges of chores. He took a path that slid past graffiti that read like secret advice, past a cluster of ducks who eyed him with the long memory of creatures who know humans are erratic, past runners who nodded and gave him the fellowship of the early. He counted lampposts as always and felt, not for the first time, that the rhythm he made on pavement could be a sincere answer to a question he had never quite managed to ask out loud. On the way back he stopped on a footbridge and looked down at a bicycle submerged just under the water, its wheels catching the light indecently, and thought of all the things people throw away and all the ways they get caught, beautiful for a second in their ruin.\n\nThe studio smelt of coffee and freshly opened gaffer tape. A man in a high-vis vest with a crisp sense of purpose frog-marched a crate of cables across his line and nodded at Rafi like they were both in on a secret that involved electricity. In a conference room that had been dressed with a bowl of fruit as if that could distract from its windowlessness, the health and safety briefing gathered them in and told stories about burns and bruises with the rhythm of someone who had seen them all. A slide of a foot with a melted sole made someone gasp. Rafi took notes because taking notes was a way to carry luck in your pocket, and because the man had the farmer\u2019s gift of turning warnings into parables. Fog machines were friendly if you knew their names. Pyro didn\u2019t care that your mum was watching. Everything had a wake and you had to learn to live in it.\n\nFlo, the stage manager, found him in the corridor and put a roll of tape in his hand like a priest pressing a rosary onto a sinner at the door. \u201cYour lane,\u201d she said, and it sounded like a benediction. She was compact and brisk and had the kind of laugh that used too few syllables and still felt like a gift. She showed him the marks that were his. She told him where the camera would be when he was meant to look at it, even though he had explained he didn\u2019t really look at cameras, he looked at somewhere above them where his courage seemed to sit. She walked him through a plan to get his boxes on and off without creating a traffic problem. She had a list attached to her list and he loved her for that immediately.\n\n\u201cMedia next,\u201d Rosanna said, appearing from nowhere the way producers do when the schedule threatened to slip down the back of the sofa. \u201cAt the press lunch. You\u2019ll be fine. Smile, breathe, say the thing you want to say and not the thing they suggest, and if somebody tries to turn your life into a one-sentence caption, step over it.\u201d\n\n\u201cA press lunch?\u201d he said. He had imagined three people in a corner with branded pop-up banners and a woman with an iPad. Lunch made it sound like there would be cutlery and opinions that wore linen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s sandwiches with microphones. You\u2019ll be grand,\u201d she said, and he trusted her and did not trust her in equal measure because that was how these things worked.\n\nHe messaged Leah and told her when they wanted him. She replied with a photo of a hand-drawn ladder with a speech bubble that read, come on then, rise. She was getting the midday train. He felt a childish relief at the thought of her voice inside these walls. He packed his little tiffin of rice and dal into his bag even though he had now been told there would be food. He wanted to sit at a table with his own cooking like a pilgrim disobedient to a temple and watch people try not to stare at the fact that his lunch had orange on the outside and a smell like all the kitchens he trusted.\n\nThe press area was a rectangle borrowed from a different building, which meant it had the wrong carpet. Someone had thrown ferns at it to help, and a lighting rig pretended to be a skylight. Long tables were laid as if fifteen weddings were about to happen at once. Journalists had the look of people who had already written half of what they would say and were just waiting to plug in quotes like plug sockets. He took a seat between the magician and the violinist. The magician had changed his tie three times in the previous hour and now had one that looked like a piano on a good day. The violinist had put resin on her fingertips by accident and now they shone, which made her hands look like they were lit from the inside.\n\n\u201cPress,\u201d the magician mouthed, and made the kind of smile you make when someone tells you an exam will be easy if you don\u2019t think about it too hard. The first person to reach them had hair the colour of a strawberry that had won a fight and a notebook with hearts on the edges that had been drawn long ago and contaminated many interviews since. She looked at Rafi\u2019s containers because they were not the sandwiches, then at his face, then at her list. \u201cRafi,\u201d she said, steadying herself. \u201cWe loved your semi-final. You turned running into poetry. How does that feel? And, you know, being brown and everything. Representation.\u201d\n\nHe had prepared to talk about pace and pain and the little altar you plant in your chest when you go for a time. He had not prepared to have his skin announced as if it had bought a ticket. He found his mouth choosing a sentence that would not shame either of them. \u201cIt feels like the body\u2019s another language,\u201d he said. \u201cRepresentation is lovely, but I\u2019m not a flag. I\u2019m a person who moves.\u201d\n\nThe violinist\u2019s head tipped at that like a small bird hearing a note it liked. The journalist made a series of ticks that sounded like she was counting something other than words. \u201cVery good,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd your mum. She\u2019s important to you?\u201d\n\nHe laughed because that was the safest thing to do when someone put your mum on a plate like a biscuit. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s my first audience.\u201d\n\nThere were other questions from other corners. One man asked him whether he thought Britain was ready for \u201calternative physical theatre,\u201d pronouncing each word as if it had to audition for its own syllables. Someone else wondered if he had ever been bullied, and when he told the truth\u2014only the usual kind and even then he had had friends who made jokes with him, not at him\u2014she looked mildly disappointed. A woman with a tattoo of a swallow just inside her wrist asked him what trainers he wore and then, without any transition that made narrative sense, whether he thought footballers were overpaid. He held tight to his resolve to be kind and useful and when he was not sure he was achieving either, he pretended to be a person who had been told to talk slowly.\n\nMidway, a man with a piece of laminated lanyard armour that had more colours than necessary introduced himself as a \u201cbrand liaison\u201d and sat down as if he had always known Rafi. He said words like synergy with a straight face. He showed him a little sachet of neon gel as if presenting a sacrament and suggested it might be a nice moment, on camera, if Rafi \u201cfuelled\u201d just before he went on. Rafi thought about how his stomach did not like strangers and how he had already promised not to put anything new into his system today. He thought of the time he had eaten a pastelito in a Buenos Aires youth hostel because everyone else was eating them and spent the night talking intimately to a sink. He smiled and said, \u201cI have my own routine. Thank you.\u201d The man frowned as if Rafi had defied a calendar. Yvonne, watching from the serving station with arms folded and the grin of someone who enjoyed being underestimated, said, \u201cNot today, sweetness,\u201d in a way that placed a protective arm around him without touching him. The man moved his campaign elsewhere, and Rafi loved Yvonne more than was reasonable for someone he had known for twenty-six minutes.\n\nHe sat on the edge of the canteen\u2019s noise and ate his food with the careful speed of a person in a buffet wars environment. The magician could not stop doing tricks, which meant his soup kept jumping without warning. The choir in coordinated blue sang happy birthday to itself, which suited Sundays but felt extravagant on a Wednesday. The comedian tried out a line about the judges and then immediately retracted it as if words could be pulled back like dogs who had gone too far off lead. The fourteen-year-old singer\u2019s mother cut her daughter\u2019s chicken into strict identical squares and lined them up on the plate because order always soothed someone. Rafi felt his gut tighten not with food but with the attention of people who were looking and deciding what he would be to them. He put his spoon down and breathed so his chest would get the message and stop bracing for a sprint.\n\nRosanna pulled him from the corner before he could think himself into knots. \u201cTell me it was painless,\u201d she said, and he said, \u201cIt was a thing. I didn\u2019t bleed,\u201d which was as close to praise as he could get. She had a new brightness in her eye that could only mean an idea. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking,\u201d she said, and the we was the sort that included people in suits and nervous laughter. \u201cAbout bodies in the piece. Two movers. Not dancers, not chorus, just bodies to shift the obstacles in a way that reads more clearly for camera. You don\u2019t have to act with them. They\u2019ll be invisible, essentially, dressed in black. But they can make the lanes close and open so that your path is more dynamic for the wide shot. It gives us coverage. It gives you\u2014\u201d she searched for a word he would like and found one\u2014 \u201cbreath.\u201d\n\nHe felt himself pull away before he could command himself to stay. The entire shape of the thing lived in his forearms and his calves and that place inside the foot where the arch holds a secret. He had built it on the faith that the obstacles were honest and only did what he told them to do. People introduced stripe and error. People tripped and apologised with their whole heads and the apology wasn\u2019t retroactive. He heard the old thud of a memory\u2014his father catching his elbow in a doorway when he was ten, the day they had tried to carry a table without planning it and had taken off one of the skirting boards with a laughter that had a bruise in it. He thought of Leah and the way she had sketched two humans into the plan with arrows.\n\n\u201cLet me try,\u201d he said, surprising himself with the compromise. \u201cLet me try with them and without. If it feels like a trick and not the thing, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\n\nRosanna nodded, relief and calculation trading glances on her face. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing is in stone until we say it is in stone.\u201d Then she checked her phone and said, \u201cLeah\u2019s here. She has a rucksack that suggests she\u2019s planning to climb a mountain.\u201d\n\nLeah came into the corridor like she had been summoned by the building itself. She had one of those art student rucksacks that had stains from projects and the proud slouch of something useful. She wore a coat meant for rain that had met paint more often. Her grin filled the space beside him the way light fills a jar when you take it near a window. \u201cI am prepared to erect a city,\u201d she said by way of greeting. \u201cHow big is your floor? How many seconds to cross it? How much fog is too much fog?\u201d\n\nHe told her about the lunch and the suggestion and the bodies in black, and her face did a thing he recognised\u2014 worry moving over optimism like cloud over water, then breaking. \u201cIt could be good,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they move in a way that is air, not people. If they are wind. If they are decision. And we keep you alone at the end, because it\u2019s your piece and it must be your last image.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing must,\u201d he said automatically, but he knew what she meant. He knew what must felt like. He had built his mornings around it.\n\nThey rehearsed with two crew from a pool that existed primarily for this kind of question. The men were older than he expected, with knees that told their own stories, and dignity in the way they waited for instruction. They wore the black of people who had been told to be negative space. Flo gave them earpieces and quickly labelled them Mover One and Mover Two because names create softness you can\u2019t afford on a schedule. They tried a run. The movers slid boxes on cue and opened a lane two beats later than he wanted and his foot went where a box had been as if it still existed and he had one of those heart-stopping tiny moments where you realise you have placed your body on faith. He recovered. He lied to his breath about how fast it should come. Next time they made the timing, and when they did, it felt like the floor had learned a trick he had not taught it.\n\nHe began to see how it might work. The box that would be a wall. The alley that would become a room. The ladder that might lift on the kind of stage magic that made him feel simultaneously delighted and annoyed because he did not believe things should rise unless they had earned the right with effort. Leah stood where the main camera would be and told him where he looked like a man fighting and where he looked like a man dancing, and he filed that away for the moment where he needed the latter and felt too much like the former.\n\nOn the third run he slid on a streak of something that was not supposed to be there. He caught himself with a hand to the floor and his knee jolted in a manner that made his stomach clench with the ancient memory of gym halls and iced packs and the counsel of people who begin sentences with \u201cyou\u2019ll never.\u201d He sat back and breathed into the joint like breath could bring calm. Flo arrived at a trot with a cloth and a look that could have stripped varnish. \u201cI told them to keep the confetti hell off this floor,\u201d she said, scouring. \u201cAre you good?\u201d\n\nHe was honest because honesty was quicker than bravado in rooms like this. \u201cI jarred it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not broken. It\u2019s telling me it exists.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cWe like existence. Don\u2019t fall on live, yeah?\u201d Her tone made it a punchline and an instruction both, and he found himself smiling because he realised he was surrounded by people whose job was to keep his hubris and his ankles from doing anything foolish.\n\nHe took a break because there was no valor in pretending the knee was not speaking. Leah sat with him on the base of a fly tower and examined the camera feed. \u201cThere,\u201d she said, pointing to a frame where he lifted and the ladder came and it looked, briefly, as if he had conjured it. \u201cIf we time the light so it finds your foot at exactly that moment, you\u2019ll be the pivot.\u201d\n\n\u201cFlo said they can give us a white from above,\u201d he said. \u201cOne clean white and let the rest go blue. We\u2019ll throw shadow like a second body. It might be the thing people remember.\u201d\n\nLeah put her head on his shoulder the way she did when he had done something that justified her faith, and he let the shape of that compliment settle. He had the thought, quick and disloyal to all the ways he wanted not to want, that he could be the kind of person who made room for this woman in the middle of the noise. He didn\u2019t say it. He had learned not to say things in rooms where the air had microphones even when you couldn\u2019t see them.\n\nThe afternoon was a river he stepped into and forgot the bank. They worked. They tried a version with a beat\u2019s silence before the ladder, and a version where the silence grew to two beats and felt pretentious, and a version where one of the movers breathed an audible \u201csorry\u201d when he misheard a cue and apologised for an art no one would be able to read. He ate the banana Yvonne abandoned on a plate near his elbow like a blessing and felt nothing of the intestinal terror he had promised himself he would avoid. The stomach twist did not come with food but with a notification. It was his father, who had discovered an article online that had turned his press lunch into a wind-up toy.\n\nRunner says show saved him, the headline read, and the photo did that thing where it froze him half-lidded and gave him the look of a man who had not slept but had been instructed to look delighted anyway. The piece quoted him out of himself. It had him saying that without this chance he \u201cdidn\u2019t know where I\u2019d be,\u201d which was something humans say when they are trying to be polite about luck and get punished for it, and it made his stomach harden like a fist because he had worked in a shop and made dinners and run in the rain and he was not about to hand himself over to the idea that television had arrived like a saint with a candle. He stood there with the phone hot in his hand and felt the old anger he rarely let have the wheel and then let it go because anger burned fuel he needed for later.\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Leah asked, because she could read a screen from the cast of a jaw. He showed her. She grunted in a register that could have knocked a wall down if it had been a little louder. \u201cThey will say what they want,\u201d she said. \u201cWe say what we say, and the piece says what it says. Don\u2019t feed it. Make them film the truth instead.\u201d\n\nHe put the phone away like a thing that bit. He finished the rehearsal and found, by the time evening folded over the warehouse again, that the floor had given him a gift. The moment he had written in his notebook\u2014where the audience would think he was done and he was not\u2014had begun to exist. He found the beat where he stopped, the music went thin, the lights favoured the wrong place, and then he stepped where apparently there was nothing and a ladder rose as if the floor still wanted him. He let the move be smaller than the instinct demanded, and that made it better. Flo clapped once, sharp, a conductor finding the exact bar. Rosanna exhaled in a way that meant this was what they could sell. Even the technician with the rose tattoo, who had seen more than he let on, said, \u201cNice, mate,\u201d like a reward to a dog for a trick that had been discouraging for months.\n\nHe wrote to his mother on the walk to the hotel because he knew she would time her worry to his footsteps. He told her he had eaten, he had not fallen, the people were kind, and he used none of the bigger sentences he wanted to use because he did not know how to put television-warmed rooms and ladders into a phone message that would arrive in a house that preferred the quiet truth of a kettle. His father called and spoke too loudly as if his voice had to fill the distance with decibels, and told him without preamble that the corner shop had stuck his face on the cigarette display because they were bored and wanted something to laugh at. His aunt from Luton sent a voice note that included six different ways of saying well done and one recipe for a lentil soup that would keep grief out of your bones. He promised nothing and everything, which is what you do when people love you.\n\nIn the hotel corridor, a thin violin found him. The violinist sat cross-legged outside her own door because maybe her roommate was sleeping and lay the instrument across her knees as if it were a small animal she was coaxing into life. He sat opposite, back against the wall like a teenager. She played scales that rose like ladders and then fell again. \u201cDo you get scared?\u201d he asked when the phrase ran out of breath.\n\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d she said, wiping the bow. \u201cI like it. It means I\u2019m alive.\u201d\n\nHe thought about running as fear\u2019s twin and smiled. He thought about a coach he had had who had once spoken of fear like it was a demon you could starve. He knew now that you didn\u2019t starve fear. You fed it small, measured things and kept your own plate full. When he got back into his room he found a message from that very coach, forwarded and forwarded until it had lost its provenance, a link to the article with the offending headline, and the words: proud of you, keep your head, always believed. He sat with the complicated gift of that for a moment\u2014how praise can arrive carrying the ghost of past disappointments and still be useful. He put the phone face down and let the city hands outside his window keep doing whatever they were doing without him.\n\nAt a late hour when the corridors emptied and the carpet forgot the day\u2019s footsteps, he took the lift down to the canteen because Yvonne had promised to put aside something \u201cwith sense in it\u201d for him. She had done it\u2014rice, a stew that had been allowed to know what it was, a yoghurt that had not been bullied into sweetness. She sat on a stool, shoes off, and told him she had once almost fed a pop star a nut by mistake and been saved by a junior runner with an eye like a hawk. She told him tomorrow\u2019s lunch would be busier because the Saturday magazines came to get their human interest, and advised him not to make jokes about judges, politics or the weather turning because apparently every meteorologist in the land took it personally. He thanked her and she said, with no fuss, \u201cJust win your bit. The rest takes care of itself,\u201d and he wished he believed that more than he did.\n\nHe slept the kind of sleep that has skirts, a handful of minutes at a time, each one wary of the next. His knee hummed and stilled, hummed and stilled. He woke before his alarm because his mind had already put on its shoes. He ran a small loop in streets that looked like themselves only after eight, then returned to the studio because there was nowhere else to go that could hold the energy he had wound up. He walked the empty seats and said hello to them in his head like a host preparing for a party, told the sixth row they would laugh, told the balcony it would get its own private performance when he looked up. He found the ladder and touched one of its rungs as a foolish lover might touch a doorpost and immediately stepped back because you don\u2019t give inanimate objects that much control. He taped his laces down though his shoes did not need it. He put a small pebble from the Ouse on the floor beside his starting mark and Flo carefully moved it later with two fingers and a nod, which meant it was now a prop with paperwork.\n\nThe press lunch grew itself from nowhere in a sudden blooming of napkins and cameras. He felt prepared and not, which was his usual state. He chose a seat near the edge and found that his choice of edge did not matter because edges were illusions at events where everyone was invited to lean. The first question this time came from a woman who spoke softly and wrote quickly. She asked him who had taught him to run. He could have said no one and everyone and the body and hunger and the day he had not known what to do with himself at sixteen. He said his father, because it was partly true and because the words put something warm into the room. The follow-up was about his dad\u2019s absence from Manchester. He explained a rota of work and distance and sanity and she nodded like she understood, and he felt grateful because understanding was a rare currency.\n\nWhen he returned to the floor after, his stomach had that twist in it that comes when you have been seen and not entirely in the way you would have chosen, and he did the only thing he knew to do with that feeling. He ran the piece. He ran it twice and then again. He ran it like a man reminding himself what belongs to him regardless of who is looking. He found the breath inside it that Rosanna had promised and the wind that Leah had asked for and the quiet moment that would mean everything in a room designed to overtalk. He jumped and did not fall. He looked up the way he had promised and found faces that were not there yet and rehearsed the nod he would give to them. He shaped the movement so that even people who thought they hated running might love watching him try to turn leaving and returning into something they could feel in their own legs.\n\nHe did not know what the cameras would decide he meant. He did not know what the show would edit him into. He knew what his body was for. He knew what the floor could hold. He knew the exact number of steps from the mark to the place where the ladder would lift and he would look, for a heartbeat, like a person who had summoned something from nowhere and it had obeyed. He let that be enough until the door of the day opened again and everything he had promised himself to be began to be tested.",

                              "content": "Chapter 4\n\nHe came home with London still stuck to his skin like a second weather. The train had delivered him into the geography that made sense, the one with hedges that had arguments with themselves and a sky that kept staring as if it had known him since he was small. The village was doing what villages do on a Monday after someone from there has been on the telly: pretending it hadn\u2019t noticed and then noticing in a surge at the butcher\u2019s, or outside the post office, or in the way a window\u2019s curtain twitched like a blink. He stood in his own hallway with its damp wool smell, put his bag down exactly where it always bruised the skirting board, and breathed as if breath was a thing you had to practise after days of being watched.\n\nHe ran before he had a chance to think better of it. The cold had sharpened while he was away, the air brushing his teeth from the inside. The Ouse had its shoulders up as if it too had felt, in some reptile part of its current, the weight of lights miles away. He found the path as if it had been sleeping with one eye open for him and now wanted a report. His knee told him, oh yes, hello, we remember, and then settled under the familiar bargain of warmth. The old man with the terrier appeared where he always appeared, conjured by habit and the smell of wet earth. They did not nod this time. The man lifted his chin and spoke the way you speak when you\u2019ve been rehearsing lines for weeks. \u201cSaw you,\u201d he said. \u201cSaw you jump. Good, that.\u201d\n\nRafi wanted to say that he had not so much jumped as negotiated with gravity and paperwork. He said, \u201cThank you,\u201d and the terrier, whose eyes had known sorrow and left a little room for joy despite it, gave a bark that sounded like agreement. \u201cName\u2019s Jim,\u201d the man added, which felt like a medal more than a name. \u201cDog\u2019s Mavis. Don\u2019t laugh.\u201d Rafi didn\u2019t. He ran on with Mavis\u2019s bark making a neat knot at the end of his last sentence.\n\nOn the way back he let his stride lengthen as if he were opening a book too quickly and then forced it smaller because speed had nowhere to be today. He stopped where the once-started hedge still made a promise to the future and couldn\u2019t quite keep it. He touched the scar on his gums with his tongue out of habit. He considered the map of his village anew. There would have to be a new mark now: here, the place where he had thought, after the final, sitting on a dressing-room sofa with glitter sticking to his forearms like a broken galaxy, that relief felt like a betrayal. He had not won. He knew that saying it like that made it sound heavy and it was not quite heavy, it was a stone he could put in his pocket and forget until he reached in for keys. The dog had won, in the end, which was a sentence you can say about many British evenings. The choir had sung as if the roof would be kind. The magician had turned his hands into a church and still lost, which he had expected and not expected. The fourteen-year-old had been brilliant in the way fourteen-year-olds are brilliant\u2014pure and unarmoured and completely unprepared for what morning papers can do. He had stood under falling confetti cut in the shapes of stars that did not look like any stars he trusted, and smiled until his face asked to clock off.\n\nIf you had asked him for an image of his own performance, he would have given you the moment he had expected to go to sleep over and over in the night and never did: the quiet, the lights looking the wrong way on purpose, the breath coming like a well-behaved animal, and then that small step into somewhere that decided to be there exactly when he needed it. The ladder rose. The room made a sound it did on its own, a collective intake that turned ribs into instruments. He had not fallen. The knee had held. Mover One and Mover Two had moved like the idea of air. Flo had been a metronome with a voice. Rosanna had squeezed his shoulder and said \u201cyes\u201d not about television, but about the fact that someone had asked for a difficult thing and he had brought it. Amanda had found her word again and called it modern. Simon had tried to pretend he was immune to surprise and had failed in the half-second you cannot control. The cameras had caught one angle he had not wanted them to and three that he knew would make strangers think of their own breath. He found in the minutes after that he could stand being congratulated if he arranged the compliments in a line like shoes at a door and did not pick any of them up.\n\n\u201cTea,\u201d Maya said, already halfway to the kettle because she believed more devoutly than any saint in the doctrine of hot water. She had watched from the sofa with a cushion on her lap as if it could have protected him if the ladder had misbehaved. Her eyes were red in a way he recognised from colds and from weddings. She pressed her hand to his cheek now and then, as if the television had been a cold room and she needed to make sure he\u2019d warmed through again. \u201cYour father,\u201d she added, and did not have to finish because he could guess the list that followed. The calls. The texts. The fact that Rafi\u2019s uncle had filmed his own television with his phone and posted the recording to a WhatsApp group with a pride that had smeared every technical detail until sound and image were cousins but not siblings.\n\nHis father arrived before the cups had finished steaming, as if the distance from where he lived to their door was elastic and television had stretched it. He came in with the air of a man who had delivered a small baby and needed someone to sign for it. \u201cYou,\u201d he said, and then did something Rafi had not seen him do except once when Pakistan had won a cricket match on the last ball\u2014he sat down abruptly and was quiet. The quiet did more than the words. After a time the words caught up. \u201cMy boy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou made them listen without talking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all talking,\u201d Rafi said, because he had learned that moving was reading aloud with different punctuation. His father brushed a crumb from the table like a man mending a roof. \u201cThey will call,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the agents. You tell me. We will choose.\u201d\n\nRafi looked at his mother over the lip of his cup and found in her eyes the thought he was having to swallow. Choose what. Choose between what and what. There were emails already, of course. One from a sportswear brand that used the word icon as if it could be stuck to a person like a sticker. One from a casting director who had the kind of signature that included Latin for no good reason and suggested a role in an advert where he would need to look at a camera like a man who both loved and respected a chocolate bar. One from a school in Peterborough asking if he could come and \u201cinspire\u201d the Year Tens, which he wanted to do more than he wanted to do almost anything because Year Tens needed all the gentle hands you could find. He had the feeling of standing in a meadow at dusk where gnats rise in columns and you do not know which one will end up in your eye.\n\nVince rang from the shop and left a message that began, \u201cAre you alive,\u201d and continued, \u201cPlease come in and be normal; people keep trying to buy spaghetti like they know you now.\u201d Leah texted a photo of the village hall with the caption: imagine. He did. He could see the chalk lines on polished wood. He could see plastic chairs stacked like possibilities along the wall. He could see their ladder against the stage and the way the local light would love it more than any studio could. \u201cWe can build it here,\u201d he said aloud without meaning to. His mother, who had more talent than anyone he knew for hearing things you hadn\u2019t meant to say, nodded like a woman whose faith had been waiting for an altar. \u201cWe can,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have tables.\u201d\n\nThey went shopping because life insists on it. The co-op had arranged itself around him like a stage does around its lead without admitting to it. He tried to move as if he were not something people had opinions about. Vince tried to play it cool and failed by half. He made a little show of not ringing up the honey properly and then looked panicked until Rafi laughed and rescued him with the barcode. \u201cHow was it?\u201d Vince asked, and Rafi considered giving him a paragraph and gave him nine words instead. \u201cBig room. Good people. I didn\u2019t fall. It was loud.\u201d Vince nodded as if these were all the data points one needed to survive fame. A woman he had never seen before touched his sleeve in the drinks aisle and said, \u201cOur boy,\u201d as if she had birthed him in the queue at the post office. He bought more oats than anyone needed and a jar of mango pickle because the labels made him feel like the shelf would keep holding.\n\nAt home, Leah came with her rucksack stuffed to the drawstring lip, and the wind in her hair said she had cycled and almost run. She had watched the final with her landlady and two houseplants and had cried at what he knew she would cry at, which was not the ladder but the small moment he had salted the air with his hands in remembrance of the bits he couldn\u2019t bring with him. She held his face for a beat longer than friends sometimes do and then they got down to the business of making. \u201cWe can do Tuesdays and Thursdays at the hall,\u201d she said, pulling a notebook that looked like a patient from the bag. \u201cThere\u2019s a Tuesday upholstery group but they finish at eight and we can talk them into giving us the last half hour of their session if we can promise not to tread on the foam. Mr. Singh at the hardware will let me borrow two trestles if we bring them back clean. I asked about the ladder. There is one. It is questionable. But we can reinforce. I know a man with screws.\u201d\n\nHe answered emails with the care of a person unscrewing a jammed jar. He wrote to the school and said yes. He wrote to the brand and said thank you, no, unless they wanted to help them tour a piece to small towns and keep ticket prices low, in which case yes, absolutely, talk to him about how. He wrote to the casting director and said there was a voice in him that told him to love chocolate but it was not a face he wanted to show. He wrote to a woman called Saira who had somehow found his email and who ran a community centre in Kettering and said, could you come talk to our lads who never sit still, and he wrote yes so quickly that his fingers caught on the keys. He wrote to Rosanna and told her plainly that the show had not saved him, but the room had been kind and that he would be grateful to the floor for as long as he could remember floors. Rosanna wrote back with a sentence he would keep for a while: The room is a room because people like you come into it.\n\nHe went back to the track two days later because he wanted to see if the old ghosts would still hum. The coach who had told him, once upon a year heavy with numbers, that he would need a second and a half, was there in his cap with the salt stain. The man looked at him and did the British thing with his mouth where he prepared for emotion and then strapped it down and let it out anyway. \u201cI was wrong about you,\u201d he said, and Rafi held up a hand because wrongness about the past was not the flavour of the day he could digest. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were right about that second. I never found it. I found other seconds. They still count.\u201d They ran a little, not because anyone needed to but because the simple act of stepping in rhythm with another person slapped meaning onto the air. The coach, whose name was Lawrence but whom everyone called Lo because the long name didn\u2019t suit him unless you were telling him off, watched his knee the way a doctor watches a test result. \u201cCareful,\u201d he said, not dour, not doom, just an offering. \u201cYou\u2019re about to be pulled at by people who don\u2019t know your body. Keep some for yourself.\u201d\n\nHe and Leah took their shoes off at the door of the village hall because the caretaker had that rule and also because respect is a thing you can practise. The place was a museum of minor triumphs. A faded noticeboard announced a jumble sale from 2007 with a zeal that time had not dimmed. The stage had curtains that had retired from being loudly red but still liked to remember the job. They chalked the floor and the chalk made their own stars, small and honest. Kids from the after-school club peered in and they let them, because the best way to start a myth is to let someone watch without paying for it. Leah moved the boxes like a librarian moving books. They practised the ladder\u2019s rise with a carefulness that felt like prayer and a rope that could have been a snake if it had tried harder. At eight forty-five Mr. Potter from the upholstery group popped his head back in and said, would they be needing the foam offcuts, and Leah said, keep your offcuts, we love you, and Mr. Potter blushed because no one had said that to him in decades and he\u2019d thought he was long done with blushing.\n\nMoney came into conversations like weather. They drew up a list of expenses and it made a thin column and then grew fatter when they remembered things like insurance and leaflets and the fact that people liked soft lighting even when they said they didn\u2019t. They applied for funds with a form that asked them to perform humility and ambition on the same page. Leah had more patience for boxes than he did and he blessed her with snacks and praise while she translated their bodies into words for a panel somewhere that would read them while eating a sandwich and deciding futures between bites. His father called with a business plan that relied heavily on the idea that people would pay to watch him run like a man on fire. His mother suggested the most sensible thing of all: ask the village to borrow space and time and hands. \u201cYou all raise each other here,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is why we live in a place like this.\u201d\n\nThey did a small thing first. A showing, Leah called it, though the piece was not a show yet, it was a creature being coaxed. They put three rows of chairs at the front and made tea and brought biscuits that were not posh but were offered like jewels. Thirty people came, which felt like a crowd made of relatives and the curious. His aunt drove from Luton and sat ramrod straight as if posture could keep the world\u2019s nonsense out. Jim came with Mavis and apologised when she barked with excitement exactly at the moment Rafi hopped the pretend fence, and then everyone laughed and the laugh was the kind that makes you feel you are exactly where you should be. He ran the piece small. No fog. No pyro. No camera that could see better than human eyes. He let the silence grow where it had grown under lights and found it did something different in a room with a notice about Tai Chi peeling at the corners. At the end, he stood and there was a second where he wanted to say something. He didn\u2019t. He bowed like someone whose mother had taught him what to do with gratitude in public, and Leah\u2019s eyes said: it works even when it whispers.\n\nThe day after, messages came of the kind that matter. \u201cMy lad is ten and never sits,\u201d Saira wrote back to say, \u201che sat.\u201d A man who had not spoken at the showing sent a photograph of his trainers at the door and wrote, \u201cRan this morning for the first time in twenty years. My knees are cross. Feels good.\u201d The school in Peterborough gave him a date and asked if they could film if they promised to delete every frame with a child\u2019s face, which was the kind of promise you signed your name to even though you knew the digital world could still smuggle you. He and Leah made a poster and took it to the post office and the woman behind the counter made a display that somehow made the word mile look like a cousin of miracle without anyone choosing that on purpose.\n\nOne afternoon, when the rain found its confidence again and did what it did to the lanes with relish, an email came from a man who formatted his name with a lot of capital letters and asked whether Rafi would consider joining a \u201ccelebrity series\u201d where he would be paired with a gymnast and teach them to \u201ctell their story through the medium of sprint.\u201d Rafi read it and thought of dollars and the sound of his mother\u2019s shoes on the stair and the pinboard on the fridge. He closed his eyes and saw two numbers: the cost of a new boiler and the cost of saying no. He wrote back that he was flattered, he was even grateful, but he was building a thing that did not survive well in rooms where story wore sequins and judges. The man wrote back a line that had the taste of a threat and he kept the email as proof that sometimes the world did not deserve the care you took with your sentences.\n\nThe distribution centre wrote too, finally, with the tone of an invitation that had lost its sprightliness. They were \u201ccurrently fully staffed\u201d but would \u201ckeep his details on file.\u201d He stared at that and had the odd sensation of falling without moving. Relief and resentment found the same chair. He picked the kettle up, put it down, picked it up again. He would need money. The piece would need money. He could clean the hall on Saturdays. He could stack cereals with a religiousness that still amused Vince. He could say yes to the school talks and the community centres and take the fees and make a stained-glass window out of small notes and coins and warm soup. He could ask his father to lay aside the bit of him that liked a miracle in exchange for the bit that was good with a hammer and shelves. He could live in the space between enough and not enough and build something steady.\n\nOn a morning that was almost spring if you squinted, Lo came to the hall and watched from the back like a man assessing a field for yield. He did not take notes because there are some things you don\u2019t make lists about. When Rafi had finished a section, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re doing the thing I tell the kids when they ask me about sprint and I say, it\u2019s about leaving without forgetting to take yourself. You go and you stay at the same time. It makes people cry. They don\u2019t know why.\u201d Rafi laughed because the line was too neat and not, and then his eyes did the thing you don\u2019t make jokes about. He put his hands on his thighs and breathed and said, \u201cTea,\u201d because there were words he could not say in daylight to men who had taught him other words.\n\nThey got a small grant that paid for light and for Leah\u2019s time in a way that made her sit down at the kitchen table and momentarily forget how to swallow. They got a call from a theatre in Cambridge that had a black box they weren\u2019t using on three consecutive Tuesdays and would they like to come and make the floor scuff on purpose. They said yes to all of it and then took turns remembering to sleep. Flo texted him a photo of a roll of tape with the words: it\u2019s still ours if you need it. Yvonne sent a message without warning: stew recipe, foolproof, will feed the whole hall, please stop starving out there, x. Rosanna appeared in his inbox sometimes with a link to an article about how attention becomes a job. He read them all. He did not fall through the cracks in between because Brampton was a net.\n\nThere were new small rituals. He put the pebble from the soundstage by the back door and touched it before he left as if he were proving to it that he was not being unfaithful to the floor he had loved before. He fixed the stuck front door instead of shouldering it because you can only slam against resistance for so long before it makes a pattern in you. He did the crossword with his mother even when he was late because clues are a way to believe in answers and they had both earned that belief. He took Mavis a pig ear he had looked up to make sure did not ruin dog stomachs, and Jim accepted it with the solemnity of a man who had buried three people and knew the value of small comforts. \u201cYou didn\u2019t fall,\u201d Jim said again one morning apropos of nothing, and Rafi said, \u201cNot then,\u201d and Jim nodded like a man who had watched a lifetime of then and now and knew both could change their minds.\n\nThe day they loaded the ladder into the back of a borrowed van to drive it to Cambridge, his phone rang with a number he didn\u2019t know. He balanced the rung against his shoulder and answered because he had started to practise saying hello to the unknown. The voice on the other end was warm and had the kind of smile that makes sound. She said her name was Kaia and that she worked with a festival of \u201csmall and intense things\u201d in the north. She had seen a clip in an ecosystem she refused to name and wanted to know if he would like to bring his mile to a room in a library that had a ceiling that understood hush and a floor that was tired of chairs. \u201cWe have no money,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we have bread and a roomful of people with ears.\u201d He looked at Leah who looked at him with the greed of a woman who loves bread and ears more than most things money can buy. He said yes and felt the click it made in the map of the year. He did not yet know the road or the hotel with beige and no windows, or the one person in that northern library who would stand up too quickly when he finished and knock his knee on the chair and swear softly and then go outside and run because sometimes you have to obey your legs immediately. He did not know that his father would learn how to livestream a Northern festival and that his mother would think every town with rain was the same and worry accordingly. He did not know that he would learn to sleep on trains better than in beds and that he would acquire the precise understanding of which Tupperware lids never betray you. He did not know that people would begin to email him with their runs\u2014their first, their worst, their mornings\u2014and that his inbox would become, in its way, a cardiology ward.\n\nHe knew only that he would keep moving until the map of where he had been began to look like a story. He knew the line between attention and being seen and he put his foot on the one he wanted. He knew that he would eat the stew Yvonne had vouchsafed with a confidence that would make his mother both proud and slightly jealous. He knew that he loved Leah in a way that hovered companionably near words but did not force them, and that if anyone tried to force them for him he would run the other way for a bit and then circle back and tell her anyway in a yard between a hall and a hedge. He knew that when the sky made up its mind and cracked into blue, there would be speed and he would offer it to the nearest patch of air like a gift that cost both of them something and returned more than it took. He knew, with a surety that made the floor less wobbly, that he would still be here in the mornings, when the mist rolled off the Ouse like steam from an overworked kettle, and that the path would greet him as if he hadn\u2019t left at all.",

It smelt of old rugs and something like cloves, and the glove compartment contained a map of Britain that showed motorways as if they were bravely invented yesterday. Rafi and Leah wedged the ladder with a lattice of bungee cords and promises, and tucked boxes around it the way you tuck blankets around a sleeping child. Maya stood at the gate holding a flask like a benediction. She had wrapped sandwiches in greaseproof paper because she refused to believe in cellophane. \u201cBread and ears,\u201d she said, because she had liked that line and had turned it into a packing instruction. Rafi kissed her cheek twice, once for the road and once for the return, and his father pretended he was indifferent to the van\u2019s rust while checking its tyres with the toe of his shoe in a way that suggested prayer.\n\nThey drove north with the ladder humming like a tuning fork every time they crossed a seam in the road. The hedges broke up into moors that looked like a map had been rubbed until it forgot the edges of things. Leah read out place names like charms. She kept a list she said she would use for characters she had not met yet: Kirkby Stephen, Barnard Castle, Stainmore. She sang, quietly, because she sang to the road the way some people sang to kettles to make them boil faster. They stopped once on the hard shoulder because the rear door made a sound that had to be investigated immediately and found nothing but wind, which was reassuring and not. They ate the sandwiches in a lay-by where a lunching lorry driver offered them leftover apples with the generosity of someone who liked to see people moving a purpose in a van not meant for glamour. When the land began to dissolve into brick and viaduct and a river surprisingly wide, Leah reached over and put her hand on Rafi\u2019s knee like a reminder that bodies have anchors, and he felt the ladder\u2019s humming stop inside him even as the van rattled on.\n\nKaia met them on the library steps with a scarf that could have padded a house. She had hair that did not obey a straight line and a way of looking at you as if she were borrowing your face for a painting. The library itself had the air of a cathedral that had run out of saints and started stocking paperbacks instead. Stone rubbed by years fell down into carpet gone bald in particular patches; the ceiling had the kind of arches that make you instinctively whisper. \u201cYou found us,\u201d Kaia said, as if other people had set off for this place and never arrived. \u201cExcellent. I\u2019ve got three volunteers and a librarian called Mr. Dalton who uses silence like a weapon, but he\u2019s agreed to let us have a bit of noise if it\u2019s useful noise.\u201d She led them in past posters for poetry nights and a notice about a knitting group that had chosen a name with a pun in it and then regretted it. Children were being taught to handle books like animals. An old man slept with his mouth open under a banner that read READ YOUR WAY TO FAR PLACES, which felt like a lesson in how to take instructions seriously.\n\nThey set the space the way you arrange a table for people you care about. Between stacks and a stairwell they conjured a lane. Leah held a tape measure with the look of a person holding a wand, and Rafi learned the dimensions of aisles with a respect usually reserved for rivers. They met the volunteers: a boy with a hoodie bitten by cigarette burns who laughed like he was apologising for something from three summers ago; a woman who had brought her daughter and told Kaia plain that she\u2019d come to see if someone could make her teenager listen without shouting; a retired teacher called Moira who had the kind of competence that makes you check your shoelaces for neatness. Mr. Dalton appeared like a plot point and approved the positioning of a rubber mat with the solemnity of an altar boy. \u201cNo running between the stacks,\u201d he said automatically, and then stopped himself, and something like a laugh cracked the dryness around his mouth.\n\nIn rehearsal, the ladders seemed almost pious in that room. The hum of circulation was different, the air full of the damp wool of coats and library breath. The floor gave a hush back to his shoe that made him weigh every footfall as if each could be a word too loud. He found out fast that the turn by the returns desk needed to be slower or the corner of an oak shelf was going to acquaint itself with his ribs in a way they would all regret. Leah adjusted the timing of light because there was no light to adjust; she placed lamps instead, desk lamps with green glass shades borrowed from the room upstairs, and called it design like a dare. The volunteers offered their hands, and in the absence of headsets and Flo\u2019s choreography, they moved the boxes with a gentleness that made Rafi\u2019s throat tighten because they were moving more than objects. The hoodie boy watched the line he was making with suspicion and then pride, which is how roads get built. When they ran the piece the first time, someone in the upstairs reading room dropped a book and the thud rolled down the stairwell like a thought that had reconsidered. Kaia stood at the back with her arms folded, not in judgement but like a person trying to contain heat between her ribs and spare it for later.\n\nThe audience came like weather. They weren\u2019t fans, not like in a television studio; they were an arrangement of neighbors, city strangers, stray lunchers, and three women whose hair was perfect in a manner that meant time had been spent. A man in a suit sat alone and took off his watch as if to agree to being here. A little girl chewed the end of her sleeve and then stopped because her mother squeezed her hand once and that was all the instruction necessary. A student with a ring in his lip studiously pretended to be bored and then failed. When Rafi began, it wasn\u2019t with the drum of a TV track; it was with the sound of a pencil somewhere, with the crackle of a radiator trying to be useful, with the slow intake of breath that libraries require before anything happens. He laid out his distance between the stacks like you lay out an argument between people who love each other. He kept some of the big beats, because they were honest, but the room took the volume it could bear and returned it as resonance rather than thunder.\n\nThe ladder\u2019s rise in that building was stranger and cleaner than it had ever been. A corner light hit the rung as if it had been waiting its whole career for this job. Someone made a noise that would have got you shushed in another context and Mr. Dalton did not shush them. Rafi found the pause he had marked in pencil in his head and let it deepen because the room held him up instead of gravity. When he finished he didn\u2019t bow so much as tilt, because there was no stage for the gesture to land on. The suit man stood too quickly and banged his knee on the chair in front; he swore, and then laughed, and then left, and then, through the glass doors, Rafi saw him run a short way down the street like someone who had remembered an appointment with his old self. A woman cried in the way you cry when you remember to blink. Kaia clapped alone at first, and then together was made, and it was enough.\n\nAfter, they ate the bread. Kaia had meant it literally. There were loaves from the bakery around the corner, a loaf with seeds that dared you to bite and one with a gloss as if it had been varnished. There were bowls of soup that had been called \u201cwith substance\u201d on the poster, and for once the truth matched the taste. People queued as they do when English people are determined to be orderly even about gratitude. The hoodie boy took two bowls and a crust and left without speaking to anyone except Leah, to whom he said, \u201cThat bit where you do the small jump and then the little one\u2014I thought you were going to not,\u201d which was how you made hospitality into a review. Moira squeezed Rafi\u2019s forearm with a pressure that would cut diamonds. Mr. Dalton said, \u201cBooks can\u2019t do everything,\u201d and his voice had to fight its own dryness to get out. Kaia introduced them to a poet who was writing a book about attention, and he laughed at the idea as if it were a cat that had sat on the piano instead of Bach.\n\nThey slept above a bakery that night in a bed that had seen things but was still doing its job with dignity. The room held a tiny sink that could not commit to being hot but was charming about it. The scent of tomorrow\u2019s bread rose through the floorboards and made everything seem kinder. Leah sat at the end of the bed with her legs tucked under and drew the shelves out of memory in a notebook that had lost the first ten pages years ago and did not miss them. Rafi lay down and then sat up and then lay down again because his knee had begun to hum with the smugness of effort. They talked with their heads against the wall because walls listen differently. Leah said she had been invited to a residency in Glasgow by a woman who made art with light and patience and a toaster she treated like a pet, and the residency came with access to equipment and a stipend so small it would pay for exactly the amount of coffee she couldn\u2019t drink or she would jitter through ceilings. She asked what he thought like you ask a mirror for advice. He looked at her and saw the thread of her work unspooling on another city\u2019s pavement; he saw nights without her voice settling the corners of a room with jokes thin as knives; he felt a little jealous and told the truth anyone who loves a person who makes things has to learn. \u201cGo,\u201d he said, and then added, because he could not help it and did not want to, \u201cand come back or let me come to you; there\u2019s no prize for choosing one world forever.\u201d\n\nThey got up at a time that was not morning or night and went out to find the bakery already in full hymn. The woman behind the till identified them as the ladder people and smuggled a bun into their bag and told them not to argue. They drove home with the ladder less talkative, as if it had learned something it needed to chew on. The hills leaned nearer to the van on the way back, or perhaps it was only that Rafi and Leah had become quieter and so the landscape took the opportunity to speak. They stopped once to pee in a lay-by and Leah used a toilet in a caff that had a notice reading NO POETS above the hand dryer; she came back with a grin that stayed for three junctions. They made a game of counting the number of times Rafi\u2019s father would pretend he had only just arrived when they pulled into the street and he was already standing at the gate with a screwdriver and news.\n\nBringing the piece home from elsewhere changed its shape. The village hall looked at them like a friend who has read the book you love and has questions. People began to treat Tuesday and Thursday as events you could add to a calendar. There were teenagers at the back pretending not to look and older men pretending they were just walking by and then discovering their feet chose the door. Saira sent a message saying the Kettering lads had given a standing ovation that had been twenty percent mockery and eighty percent sincere, and so, balanced, had not collapsed. The school in Peterborough had set a date and, in a line that should have only belonged to farce, asked if they could bring the ladder, and Rafi wrote back that they would bring two ladders if it would make the boys think twice about what you can build.\n\nAt Peterborough he watched a boy throw his jacket at a chair like a gauntlet and then sit on the floor when everyone else sat on chairs because chairs are an allegiance. He watched a girl who had drawn eyes on her hands so she could look twice. He began the way he had learned to begin with young people: without a preamble, as if you had burst into their day and would leave it and they should be allowed to decide whether you were a thief or a guest. He did a small version and let the pauses be longer than the impatient part of him preferred, and the room rewarded him with a silence that had purpose. When they asked questions, the boy with the chair jacket asked, \u201cWhat do you do if you can\u2019t run,\u201d and the question did not care about shin splints. Rafi looked at his knee and then at his hands and then at the bit of the floor where the polish had given up. \u201cYou find the bit of your body that still moves,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might be a very small bit. You do that bit until the rest remembers. Or you borrow someone else\u2019s bit. People can be very useful.\u201d The boy absorbed that, or pretended to, and then held the edge of a box while Rafi shifted it, and their hands bumped in a way that told Rafi as much about adolescence as any book would have.\n\nHis father, consistent as tide, tried to find the agent before the agent found him. Two men called about being intermediaries between him and brands, and one woman offered him \u201ca friendly shape to your decisions,\u201d which sounded like the softest threat. His father liked the woman because she had a voice that reminded him of a radio show from 1994, and he disliked the men because one of them wore a scarf indoors. They sat in the kitchen with the kettle ticking like a metronome and argued in the respectful register they had learned when Rafi was sixteen and almost catastrophic. \u201cYou have to say yes to one of them,\u201d his father said. \u201cThe world doesn\u2019t just let people make things. It takes tax, it takes time, it takes money, and if someone wants to pay for your shoes, let them pay.\u201d Rafi, carefully, because he had been careless before and it always cost, tried to explain that the wrong money pulled the wrong thread and then you found your jumper in your hands. \u201cWe can do it small,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can do it slow. We can do it with people and bread and roofs that leak and a poster in the post office. I don\u2019t want to be a thing you can buy in the bits between talent shows.\u201d His father drank tea as if it were a counterargument. The words made marks on the table that wiped away later because love typically has a cloth ready. They compromised, because both of them were good at it: his father would keep collecting messages in a notebook with a phone number Maya had insisted not be Rafi\u2019s, and Rafi would promise to listen to one pitch a week so that they would not miss the good fish while swearing off trawlers.\n\nHe hurt his knee properly in March, which was silly because it happened when he stumbled on the two inches between the hall\u2019s stage and the floor, a danger everyone knew and therefore no one saw. He felt the familiar pull and something like tearing paper, and he swore quietly and sat and then lay down because sitting wasn\u2019t enough and lying down was too much, and Leah\u2019s face above him did that thing faces do when they want to be two faces at once: a calm one for the person looking up and a panicked one for the room. Lo arrived because someone had texted him and he always arrived when knees were involved. He poked and said kind things that had verbs in them and made telephone calls to a physiotherapist who had a waiting list and a soft spot for teachers, and managed to make Rafi feel that this was a perimeter rather than a cliff. For a week he didn\u2019t run. He learned the weight of walking again as if it were a skill. He taped up with a seriousness that would have made Flo proud and slept with his leg arranged like a question he was trying to answer politely.\n\nThe piece learned to live without speed. Leah, who understood that form is what you do when the old shape won\u2019t hold, took the boxes and made a different language with them. She placed them so that moving through them was like reading a poem out loud when there\u2019s a word you have to pause for because it belongs to a dead friend. Rafi found a way to show breath without taking off. He learned to let stillness be the trick instead of the trick being proof he could conquer the floor. In the hall, the teenagers at the back unlocked their shoulders because stillness felt less like being dared and more like being let in; at the library in the second town Kaia sent them to, a woman who had once danced in nightclubs and now danced in her kitchen stood and showed him how hips remember even when knees don\u2019t, and he gave her back the microphone he did not have.\n\nKaia kept calling. Her festival of small and intense things had found itself a circuit by accident. Libraries told other libraries that a boy came and made their carpet do something worthwhile. Community centres added \u201cbreath and ladders\u201d to their schedules in between Pilates and toddler sessions. A town with a pier written in a language the water understood asked them to bring the piece at dusk, and they learned that gulls have an opinion about everything. They stayed above pubs and in spare rooms and once in a house where the owners were away and had left a note that said, help yourself to anything except the rhubarb gin, and then added in a different handwriting, especially the rhubarb gin. On a bus somewhere between Derby and Mansfield a girl watched Rafi online and then realised it was him and did that narrow-eyed calculation people do when they are trying to decide whether a human and their image can be reconciled, and then said, \u201cYou looked taller,\u201d and he mended her disappointment with a joke about ladders. Leah\u2019s email came, with the Glasgow residency\u2019s proper words and stamp and a promise of a tiny stipend and a larger room, and she sat with it as if someone had offered her a life she couldn\u2019t remember ordering. They promised each other something without fingernails for grip and chose to call it a plan.\n\nTelevision called too. A producer whose voice had been cleverer than him when he was tired left a message about \u201cChampions,\u201d a specials programme made mostly of people whose names had put on muscle, and suggested a return that would be \u201cgood for your brand presence.\u201d The email that followed was full of everything that had made him stand up straighter and run the other way since the final: time slots, the name of a singer whose management would be \u201cdelighted to cross-promote,\u201d a suggestion that they could \u201cenhance\u201d the piece with aerial silk because audiences loved vertical. He read it twice and then stood in the kitchen and told the kettle everything he wanted to say because kettles are good at confidentiality. He wrote back in careful we\u2019s instead of I\u2019s, because he had learned to be plural for the work that mattered. He thanked them and did not say yes; he thanked them and did not say no; he asked them what they could do for a tour of libraries and village halls and youth clubs with no pyro at all. Then he put his phone on the dresser and went to the hall to show Leah how stillness could be more arrogant than a leap.\n\nThe day the Glasgow decision became a yes, they took the news to the river. The Ouse had its shoulders down. Swans moved like they were trying not to be blamed for anything. Leah carried a paper bag with two doughnuts you had to eat immediately or regret for hours. They sat on the low wall and the stone showed them last summer in flaws and fossil and foot. Leah was effervescent in the way she got when it wasn\u2019t about speech, her hands making patterns in the air that made Rafi want to map the air itself. He tried to say he would be fine and instead said, \u201cI want the sound of you to stay in the room,\u201d and she put her head on his shoulder and said, \u201cThen you\u2019ll have to make rooms that hold sound,\u201d and it was the sort of exchange that looks like nothing from the outside and becomes, later, a hinge.\n\nThey celebrated in a fashion that no one would have recognised as such. They ate dal with the last of the ghee Maya had tucked at the back of the cupboard for a winter emergency and called this as close as they could get. They invited Lo and Kaia because Kaia had arrived in time for a showing and was sleeping on the sofa with a blanket that smelt faintly of bonfires. Yvonne sent a parcel that looked like a practical joke and turned out to be spices and recipes and a note that read, \u201cIf you can\u2019t eat well, you can\u2019t do anything well, stop arguing with me.\u201d Rosanna wrote an email that was longer than a text and shorter than a letter, congratulating and advising and not asking for anything back. Rafi\u2019s father opened a bottle from the bottom of a cupboard and the cork became a small missile that dots the paintwork still.\n\nThere were setbacks that did not deserve capital letters and earned them anyway in the diaries of people invested. A volunteer in Hull dropped a box on her toe and went home swearing that the show had made her foot religious. The van lost its right brake light because a boy on a bike had invented a theory that it would survive a smack and was wrong. A form for a small grant disappeared into an email address that was technically alive and practically dead, and Leah called it the bureaucracy of ghosts. A man in a town whose name began with C took exception to the fact that Rafi had said no to returning to television and wrote him a letter in capitals explaining exactly why he was letting the village down; the letter went up on the kitchen pinboard and down again when Maya decided the wall deserved better manners. There were mornings when the damp got into the hall and into Rafi\u2019s bone, and he did the thing he had taught other people to do: he moved the very small bit that still moved.\n\nThe day before Leah left for Glasgow, they drove to the coast because the map needed an edge. The sea was grey and honest. They took their shoes off and let their ankles forget they belonged to land; they ran, slowly for Rafi and normally for Leah, and the sand kept their secrets. They used the wind like a friend you can shout into and not annoy. On the way back they stopped in a caf\u00e9 heavily invested in bunting and shared a plate of chips with the seriousness of people agreeing terms. They talked about schedules until schedules began to sound like a game of snakes and ladders. They sat in the car on the lane into Brampton with the radio on low and neither of them could remember what the presenter had been saying, which was perfect because it meant the words between them had been louder. At the door, Maya hugged Leah like a daughter and muttered instructions about keeping warm near radiators and not trusting men who smiled with just their mouths. Rafi watched Leah pull her bag up her shoulder and knew in the plainest possible way what people mean when they say something will take time.\n\nIt did. The weeks that followed had an odd gait. The house was the same size and had to redistribute its echoes. Rafi ran early and late. He attempted a crossword and his mother filled in two clues for him because she mistrusted long words more than she mistrusted bad weather. He stood in the hall alone and broke chalk with his thumb and remembered to warm up because forgetting now had consequences. He put the ladder up and the ladder looked taller without Leah\u2019s hands on it, and he stood at the bottom of it and had the sensible thought that he should not go up, and then the less sensible thought that he could teach other hands to place it well. He invited the Brampton football lads to a session with the inducement of hot chocolate, and they arrived with their scepticism like an extra layer and left with their cheeks raw and their layers on their arms.\n\nLeah sent photos of equipment that looked like astrology. She sent a message about a light that was both a square and not a square, which thrilled her half to distraction. She sent a picture of a street she had walked at three in the morning because her head had not read Glasgow\u2019s bedtimes properly yet and she had gone out to argue. She sent a video of a toaster that had become a sculpture and then, because Leah could not resist, toast. Rafi sent her a small clip of a boy in the hall skipping the way kids skip without remembering when they learned, and a woman in a cardigan too big for her shoulder width who cried when he paused, and a stack of chairs because she liked chairs even when she said she didn\u2019t. They kept each other always by at least two streets and a coil of wire, and when they did not speak, they did not panic. Sometimes he caught himself counting his breaths in her voice and did not tell her because he wanted the trick to last.\n\nThe library in the third town had a leak and warning tape that made everything look like a crime scene. They did it anyway because water and art have always had to learn to tolerate each other. Mr. Dalton had told his cousin, it turned out, and the cousin was the librarian here, and he had entirely different ideas about noise and had printed out signs that said CLAP HERE with arrows; Rafi took the signs down and put them back up in places where they would be useful instead of bossy. The suit did not come but a woman with dirt under her nails did, and she told him afterwards that she had been running since she was eleven and between shifts and had never told anyone because it was hers. He gave her nothing but the nod you give a person when your secrets recognise each other.\n\nFlo turned up one Thursday, unexpected and inevitable, with a thermos and a roll of tape she probably did sleep with under her pillow after all. She watched and did not correct even when the tape on the floor offended her tidiness. She hugged him at the end with the side of her body that is used to heavy objects and said, \u201cI see you,\u201d and he believed her because she is the sort of woman who tells the truth even when it is mild. Yvonne sent him stew in jars with labels she had written in capitals and then drawn flowers on for no reason except joy. Rosanna\u2019s email about Champions grew increasingly polite and then stopped, which he appreciated because it meant someone had listened to a no that had been too carefully offered to be fun to receive.\n\nWhen Leah came back between light installations and lectures about light refracting through history, her bag bumped the hall door and she kissed him like you kiss someone you have identified as home and you have come back to your own sofa. She found the hall warmer because of all the breath that had been stored in it and the ladder easier because other hands had learned to lift as if lifting were not a way to show off. He watched her look at the room like a woman asking a question of a mirror and finding the right one staring back. She looked at him and smiled in a way that could not be misread by anyone with half a heart and he understood that whatever they were building had survived this small test and now deserved the next one.\n\nSometimes, after everyone had left, he and Leah sat on the stage step that had bruised his knee and held mugs of tea like proof they existed in the same temperature. They talked about the places the piece could go and the places it might refuse to go, because art is particular like that. They talked about money with the professionalism of people who had learned that hope doesn\u2019t pay for broom heads. They spoke about perhaps teaching, perhaps making a course in moving and listening for kids who had only been taught to move in straight lines. Leah told him about Glasgow\u2019s square light finally acting like a square, and he told her about a boy in Kettering who had tried to nick the chalk and then put it back because he had started thinking of lines differently. They drew maps on the backs of leaflets as if they had invented cartography.\n\nThere was a day of snow that thickened the village in the way snow does when it decides to stay. They cancelled the showing because people broke themselves on pavements for less. Rafi ran anyway, because he always did in snow; he liked his shoes\u2019 arrogance against its powder, and he liked the way the sky felt nearer because noise had been muffled. He saw Jim and Mavis because he always saw Jim and Mavis. Mavis had a coat that made her look like a small badly disguised sheep, and she left footprints like tiny commas. Jim told him the story of his wife\u2019s first winter here, how she had taught him that snow was to be walked in, not complained about, and Rafi listened because sometimes you collect the details of other people\u2019s marriages like ornaments to hang from your own future. When he got home his mother warmed him like you warm a thing you had not been sure the day would return, and his father said something about grit and duty and Rafi kissed his head without asking permission because adults did not get enough kisses and the boy inside him had learned that you don\u2019t wait for those.\n\nAt the end of that snow day, when everyone had already put their kettles on in anticipation of a future, an email arrived from someone who had tried to write like Koine Greek and failed but had succeeded in being kind. It was from a physiotherapist, not Lo\u2019s friend but another, a woman who had watched a clip online and thought she could help him unlearn the angle that kept making his knee cruel. She offered no miracles and a list of appointments that had hours Rafi didn\u2019t have and a rate he could barely afford, and he wrote back yes anyway, because bodies cannot read calendars or bank statements and still have to be answered.\n\nHe slept then the sleep of someone who had learned that making things was less about being chosen and more about choosing, who had learned that ladders are about reaching but also about coming down carefully to the floor that loved you first, who had learned he was much braver in rooms with chairs than in rooms with glitter. He woke with the mist sitting on the Ouse in its old reliable pose, and he took the map of all the rooms he had visited and folded it back into his pocket because he would need the warmth. He went downstairs to find his mother spoiling the tea leaves with boiled water and his father pretending he had not got up to stir the porridge already, and he smiled at both of them with all his good teeth and said, because you have to keep saying it until it is too normal for legend, \u201cMorning.\u201d",

The waiting room chairs made everyone the same height. A poster of a human knee showed a cross-section of tendons and words that were both familiar and a little comic\u2014patella, meniscus, the Latin for a hinge pretending to be a cathedral. A delivery driver with tape on three fingers read a four-month-old cycling magazine with concentration you would not waste on scripture. An older woman with fencing scars on her forearm tied and untied her shoelace as if she could knot pain into submission. Anita came out with a clipboard and a ponytail that had given up obedience a decade ago, and when she looked at Rafi, she looked like a person measuring the distance between a problem and a solution she intended to reach.\n\nHe expected briskness and received it, but wrapped in something warmer and older, the tone of a woman whose grandmother had taught her to boil bones into broth and who now did the same for ligaments. She asked questions that insisted on whole answers and then, when he gave her half, lifted an eyebrow until the rest came. She placed her fingers on his knee with the attention of someone listening to a lea of bees. She watched how he stood, which was news to him, because he had thought standing was just what came with legs, and she taught him how the foot had been a small liar and the hip a noble idiot long before the knee had had its say. She made him step up and down on a block and laughed at the solemnity he brought to the task. \u201cYou run like a poet when you\u2019re working,\u201d she said, \u201cand walk like a man who doesn\u2019t love himself enough. Put your feet under you. Make your backside do its job. The knee is Switzerland, it only complains because the neighbours are fighting.\u201d\n\nThe work was slow and humiliating in the way useful things are. He learned the kind of pain that asks for a chair and not a surgeon. He taped in patterns and stood on his toes brushing his teeth because Anita said that was the easiest way to remind stubborn calves they had a role. She put a metronome on his phone and told him not to chase speed yet but cadence, as if running could be taught by ticking. He lay with a band looped above his knees and opened and closed them until the muscles that did not know their own names introduced themselves. She taught him to press his big toe into the floor and felt a small but seismic change in how his arch woke, which made him feel like someone had wired a light to a circuit he had always thought was broken. When he left on the first day the ultrasound gel clung to his skin with the obstinacy of grief, and he liked it in spite of himself because persistence looked good on him and on other things that wanted to last.\n\nOn the walk home from the first appointment, the village had its hands in its pockets and its eyes on the ground, the way places do when rain has happened and they are trying to pretend it was a plan. He saw Jim in his usual spot and would have passed quietly, but Jim tapped the dog lead against his palm in a way that meant a message. \u201cMy Mavis says you\u2019ll be good,\u201d he said, as if the narrow-eyed terrier had a medical degree and favoured knees over bones. \u201cShe\u2019s got a nose for these things.\u201d Mavis looked up, snorted, and sneezed in a way that managed to be both rude and affectionate. Rafi knelt and scratched her scruff and felt the knee complain and greet him both, a domestic quarrel halfway through being resolved. He told Jim about the metronome. Jim said he\u2019d once tried to make himself walk to the beat of the shipping forecast and had ended up buying a newspaper he did not need. They parted with the easy ritual of men who had watched each other in all seasons and found each other present.\n\nLeah made the hall warm even before she arrived by the door; anticipation does that. She had the Glasgow light in her skin, the reflection of a square pretending not to be a square still in the backs of her eyes. She put her bag down, found the tape, looked at him, looked at his knee, and did not ask how he was, because the answer would be in his gait. He showed her the homework Anita had written in a tidy script that still somehow smelt of eucalyptus, and she read it like she reads scores, turning the page with a thumb as if permission had to be earned. Together, they picked apart the piece to make a nest for this new gait. They took the arrogance out of one jump and left behind something that looked like confidence instead. They stretched the pause by the noticeboard where the Tai Chi sign peeled, because the room liked it and people\u2019s shoulders lowered when he did. Leah held the metronome and, wicked, put a beat in that felt like house music for six seconds, then returned to a more generous tick. He swore at her, loving and sincere, and she grinned, admiring and shameless.\n\nCambridge\u2019s black box gave them back a version of themselves that had been waiting for a higher ceiling. The tech there did not sigh at ladders; they measured them and built a small metal safety life for each rung. The room took light like a thirsty animal. The first run read as too big, and then they taught themselves, as they had in the library, to let the piece take the volume it could use. People came with brains that had been fed by books, which makes no difference to lungs, and they inhaled at the same places as the librarian\u2019s cousin\u2019s town. Afterward, a man who had once published a paper about improvisation in early modern verse stood at the bar with a beer and cried without noise, and then said, too loudly, \u201cWell done,\u201d as if he needed to turn feeling into examination to keep standing. A young woman with hair the colour of chestnut burrs told Leah she had been trying to write about breath for months and this would help and Leah made a sound like a tiny bird being startled into life.\n\nMoney was a list that grew teeth. The van drank petrol like a cousin you cannot send away from the table. Insurance wrote to ask whether any audience members were likely to attempt to climb the ladder on their own after an event and wanted to know what signage would be present if so, as if the answer could ever be truly calming. Anita\u2019s appointments came with a price, and Rafi paid them gladly and then went to the shop to take extra shifts without calling them that, stacking tins in a row that pleased both his boss and his mother\u2019s sense of order. He and Leah went to a meeting at the council and sat under a strip light that made everyone look ghostly. They spoke to a panel who had the air of judges at a show neither of them respected, and they did their best to be brief and persuasive without performing gratitude as if mending a shirt in public. An old councillor with ears like surprised paper said the ladder worried him, and Leah said softly that they could do it without the ladder if that was what the room needed, and he looked disappointed, as if he had wanted to be the sort of man who had forbidden something and been resisted, and Rafi felt almost sorry for his thwarted heroics.\n\nKaia\u2019s calls now came with the background noise of other people\u2019s lives. She would be whispering in a stairwell while a poet refused to go on second because of a superstition about sevens. She would be stirring something that clinked against enamel. She would be shepherding volunteers into a confidence about their own thresholds. Her festival of small and intense things had grown in a manner that made her laugh and also list, and she sent them to a mill that had decided to be a community centre and to a school where the caretaker had the keys to every door ever manufactured and a face like a walnut. In one city the power failed three minutes after Rafi began. There was a small, wet collective gasp because English buildings are afraid of their own darkness. Flo would have shouted solutions and sent people running for gels and batteries; here there was only Kaia with a torch she had grabbed out of her bag and a child whose mother had taught them to carry a torch always because it made you useful in winter. Kaia handed the light to the child with strict instructions and the child shone it like a blessing. Rafi looked up and found a room that had decided to go with him anyway. He took the piece down to its skeleton. He counted out loud when he would have breathed silently. He let his foot fall make the beat. He made shadow into another body. People leaned forward in their chairs as if they were at the side of a lane and the runner had appeared suddenly and would disappear if their eyes wandered. Someone at the back whispered \u201clisten,\u201d and the room obeyed. When the lights came back, no one clapped immediately; they stood instead, and the applause, when it arrived, felt less like noise than like a building starting its own heart.\n\nThe boy who had thrown his jacket at Peterborough turned up in Kettering without announcing himself and stood at the side, near the exit, as if he wanted to practise leaving. He had cut his hair not because he had been told to but because something had bored him. He had the slant of a boy who tries to become smaller while still demanding to be seen. He watched and then did not disappear. He hung around the boxes afterward with the air of a person casing a joint and then asked Leah whether she needed hands, which even he knew was a ridiculous question. She put gaffer tape strips on his palms in an initiation that had no ceremony and told him to pull when she said pull. He did pull and did not drop anything and at one point looked at the ladder with such hunger that Rafi thought of himself at fifteen wanting a line on a track to move just so. They found out his name was Ty because Akan names have travelled and then became English without asking permission and because he said, awkward, \u201cIt\u2019s Tyler, but no one calls me that except my nan.\u201d He started coming Tuesdays and Thursdays and brought a friend once who laughed until his hoodie shook and then and then quietly came back Thursday without the hoodie. When Ty wasn\u2019t there, Rafi felt the gap and did not admit it because men can be stubborn for no good reason.\n\nRafi\u2019s father approached the problem of decisions as if it were a cupboard to be built, with shelves and screws and instructions that had been translated twice. He kept the notebook Maya had insisted on, a fat thing with an elastic that bit and pages that smelled of new. He wrote down numbers in the tidy hand he had saved for cheques and thank-you cards and words he did not want anyone to misread. He presented Rafi with one possibility a week as agreed and took rejection with a mouth that did not sulk but knew how. He also, in the third week of Anita\u2019s plan, did something uncharacteristic. He put on trainers that belonged more to dog walking than exertion and stood at the bottom of the stairs as if calling a taxi. \u201cCome,\u201d he said, and Rafi, who was not sure which of them was being called, put his own shoes back on. They walked first because you do not take a village man into running like dragging takes a suitcase back from a holiday. They walked to the bridge and then to the halfway mark of the unfinished hedge. They shared a look that stood for permission without godmothers. His father trotted then, and Rafi saw his father\u2019s body turn back into a body he knew from photographs, and a shock of tenderness went through him so quickly he missed two whole breaths. The older man ran like a caravan setting off, steady because there was nowhere else to be. He lasted longer than either of them would have predicted and then pretended he had only meant to go that far. When he stopped, he did not wheeze; he laughed. \u201cDog will outrun me,\u201d he said about a dog he did not own, and Rafi said, useless and whole, \u201cGood.\u201d\n\nThe letter from Champions came one more time, very polite, with a subject line that had learned to emulate human. It offered verticality again\u2014silk, rigs, the magic of professional harnessing\u2014and name-checked a singer whom Rafi had never heard but whose face he had seen twenty times on the co-op magazines because people with hair like that must have a quote next to their jaw. It offered a fee that would pay Anita and the van and the ladder\u2019s stiffening and new gaffer tape until kingdom come. It promised that this time they understood his ethos and would let the piece speak as it wanted to speak and would only ask that he not wear \u201cmuted tones\u201d because the camera loved him more if he did not try to pretend he was a pavement. He sat with the email and then went to the hall and turned on the big lights and sat on the floor with his back to the stage and his knees up because Anita would have told him off if he had flattened them. He watched the dust perform its ballet in the gold air. He put the email on loud in his head and listened to how the words crashed into the ribs of the room. He read it to Leah and to Maya and then to himself in the mirror in the staff toilet at the shop because that had been his rehearsal space for shock before and could be again. In the end he wrote an answer that was a thank you and a no and a plan all at once. He wrote that he had found where the piece fit and it was in rooms where people breathed each other into being. He wrote that if the show ever wanted to point a camera at a library without asking it to be purple, they could call him. He pressed send and felt that particular mix of relief and fear that comes when you have taken water away from a plant and asked it to grow stronger roots. He told his father with the respect of a man who had once thrown a door shut and regretted the echo for years. His father looked at him, then at the ledger of his own hopes, then at his wife stirring dal, and nodded like a man signing a treaty that might yet be worth the ink.\n\nThe physiotherapist\u2019s work stitched itself into everything. He found himself standing better when he poured tea and could feel when he slouched to please other people\u2019s discomfort, which was a fascinating discovery because he had not known posture could be politeness. He felt the metronome when he chopped onions, which turned dinner into a practice that Leah found both admirable and infuriating, because no one wants to marry a man who taps when you are trying not to burn garlic. He started sitting on the hall floor with kids while talking about breath because sitting on chairs had made him the wrong height for listening. Ty, who was eighteen if you added kindness and mischief like tax, asked Anita to show him how to tape an ankle because a boy on his estate had twisted something that would become two weeks of bed without help, and Anita taught him, and Ty did it, and that boy somewhere lay with his ankle neat and his pride held together by a grid of pink.\n\nSpring arrived suddenly like a dinner guest you had forgotten to expect and instantly forgave for being early. The river lost its shoulders. The lane sprouted dandelions like exclamation marks. The birds had a union meeting and decided in favour of ridiculous noise. Leah\u2019s residency ended for a time and she returned with a new way of looking at everything a bright rectangle could hover over. She taught Rafi to place a lamp so it found his shoe and made the smallest step look like a sentence he meant. He taught her to breathe in counts of easy, medium, hard, because everything was training if you named it clearly. They began to allow themselves to make future in sentences longer than one clause. They spoke about a week in June where they would do four halls in four towns and call it a tour because no one else would, and a month in September where they would do fewer rooms and thicker conversations with kids who believed shoulders were for armour. Maya, practical as always, began hoarding Tupperware. Rafi\u2019s father sourced a second-hand trolley for the ladder that would not lose a wheel on cobbles, and a man in the hardware who had refused to give him discount for a decade suddenly did and said it was about community and not because Rafi had been on the television, which made everyone smile as if they had forgotten to do it earlier.\n\nThey began taking other people\u2019s stories on purpose. After a showing, they put a paper on the table and wrote, breathe here, and left a pen. People began to leave words like seeds you press into soil with one finger. \u201cFirst run, after chemo.\u201d \u201cI ran away from him and toward something else.\u201d \u201cI am seventy-one and my left foot thinks it is twenty; I let it.\u201d \u201cI cannot run, my hip is iron, but I stand and breathe at your pause and I am moving there.\u201d The paper filled and they replaced it and that filled too, and they realised they were collecting a map that belonged to everyone. Kaia cried when she saw it and then stopped because she had pies in the oven for a fundraiser and human bodies must also eat. Mr. Dalton sent a photo of his cousin standing by a sign that said please keep quiet seated quietly next to a boy in a football shirt who was telling him a story and Mr. Dalton had written, patient in biro, you have turned my library loud and I can bear it.\n\nOne afternoon the river rose without drama, a slow, serious rising that made people frown at the sky for doing its job. The embankment took a small drink and then took more, and by morning the path knew the river too well. Rafi went to run and found himself at a new edge. He stood there like a child at a grown-up\u2019s party, hands in pockets, information his. Jim and Mavis arrived with the authority of regulars. They all looked at the water. Mavis regarded a floating twig as if it owed her money. Jim said they would give the river an hour and it would give them back the path, and Rafi thought how much of his new life had been like this\u2014waiting for something bigger than him to decide to recede. He did not run. He walked the long way round past houses he usually ignored and saw a boy who might have been Ty\u2019s brother teach a younger child to skip rope, and the rope licked the pavement like flame and no one got hurt. When he got home he had been walking long enough that his body had forgotten to want more, and he put the kettle on and found the metronome still ticking in his pocket and turned it off and did not feel guilty.\n\nThey took the piece to a prison because Kaia knew a man who knew a man who trusted her more than he trusted any email, and one day the ladder passed through a metal detector and the boxes got sniffed and Leah had to explain gaffer tape as if it were contraband mana. The men in the room had shoulders that had learned curriculum other rooms do not teach. The air smelt of bleach and longing. An officer with kind wrists told Rafi quietly which corners not to stand in and then stood near them anyway so he wouldn\u2019t have to be brave about it. Rafi did not make jokes about running. He ran small. He spoke the counts out loud because the room did not trust silence yet. He paused and felt the pause be the most dangerous and tender thing in the building. One man at the back stood abruptly and then sat again because he remembered rules about standing and not standing and his eyes were wet in the way eyes get when you are furious at them for betraying you. After, a man with tattoos like a family turned his palms up in a gesture older than laws and asked if it counted as running if you walked fast enough to forget your name. Rafi said, \u201cYes.\u201d Later, back home, when Maya asked him in the cautious way she reserved for new theatres whether it had gone all right, he said, \u201cYes,\u201d and meant yes in twenty directions.\n\nThere were arguments that did not blow walls down. He and Leah learned how to disagree about where a light should go without making the room colder. He and his father learned how to argue about agents without suggesting that love was conditional. Maya argued with a council person who had said the hall should raise its hire fee for \u201cprofessional work\u201d and she asked archly how the village would measure professionalism in a place that smelt of sponge cake and chalk, and the fee remained the same. He and Anita argued with his knee about how quickly it should trust and won some weeks and lost some. He and his body began to speak to each other less like enemies and more like business partners who admired each other\u2019s luck.\n\nOn a day when nothing remarkable happened\u2014no invitations, no money, no crisis, the best\u2014he walked to the allotments to borrow a spade for a thing that would later be called a set element and then, after it failed to look like anything except a spade, would be called a spade. He saw a notice about a summer fair in letters that had been painted by someone whose handwriting had an accent. He watched an old man and a younger woman argue delicately about compost and need and kindness. He stopped by the butcher where the man behind the counter always called him \u201cson\u201d in a tone that meant neither power nor possession, and he bought sausages because the body must have sausages sometimes even if it has an ethos and a metronome. He took them home and his mother pretended not to be delighted and then did that thing she did with onions that made summer meals taste like rain had never been invented.\n\nHe slept well that night. He dreamed of ladders that rose without permission and of floors that offered themselves like hosts. He woke to a morning that smelt of cut grass and toast and Maya\u2019s shampoo and the faint ghost of Yvonne\u2019s turmeric in a jar in the fridge. He ran a small loop because Anita had said he could and because his feet had made a contract with the Ouse as binding as a court makes. He saw Ty on the path with a friend and they pretended not to see each other until they had to, and then Ty asked about the prison in a way that made it clear he was asking about himself. He answered like a man who believed breath had to be earned, every day, willingly. He came home and the kettle sang the way kettles sing when mornings have been trained to be kind.\n\nThere would be other calls and letters and injuries and lifts in borrowed vans that rattled with ladders and resolve. There would be halls that smelt of bleach and hope and halls that smelt only of polish and biscuits. There would be nights when the metronome kept time without him and days when he left his phone in the drawer and suffered only the mild itch of missing everyone who had ever wanted anything from him. There would be a time, not far, when Leah would say \u201cwe need to decide if we are the kind of people who ask for money in advance,\u201d and they would try and not be bad at it. There would be, tomorrow, Anita reminding him that glutes are destiny and him pretending to be scandalised. There was, now, his mother with a crossword and his father with a fixed door and a pen that still had ink in it. There was the Ouse with its steam like second weather and the village with its curtains adjusting their familiarity. There was the piece, which was no longer a thing he had carried alone but a thing that had learned to be carried and had opinions about where it should go next. He put bread in the toaster and listened for the pop and found himself on the exact beat, and when he laughed, he tested his knee by accident, and the knee laughed too.",

Brampton unpacked its summer in small confident gestures: washing lines strung like bunting between converted semis, a smell of cut grass that had the nerve to be nostalgic while it was still being made, children riding bikes in pairs as if physics preferred company. The summer fair appointed the recreation ground as its temporary capital. Men you only ever saw at funerals and f\u00eates hauled trestle tables into rows, arguing gently about right angles and gravy. The WI\u2019s Victoria sponges sat with the patient hauteur of queens who know they can be decapitated by a knife and still be adored. The brass band warmed up by trying out bits of four different songs at once, which in aggregate sounded like a factory testing itself; then, as if shamed by cacophony, they found a chord and the field turned its head.\n\nLeah had drawn a little diagram of the grass like a general planning an invasion and found a corner that would not interfere with the hoopla or the ferret racing. The ladder arrived under a tarpaulin to preserve what dignity a ladder can in public and Rafi\u2019s father arranged stakes as if he were pitching their tent on the moon. Ty and two of his friends had been persuaded into volunteer tee-shirts that made them look like they had been captured by an optimistic charity. They worked fast in the way boys do when work becomes game; one of them\u2014Joel, who had hair he had to keep adjusting because it had ideas of its own\u2014took possession of the gaffer tape with missionary zeal. Leah checked the sightlines, looked at the brass, looked at the clouds; she sniffed for rain and rehearsed the speech she would give it if it came. Maya had secured the tea tent under a marshalling system that would have fed an army without visible leadership and stood in the shade counting cups as if each were a tiny hymn.\n\nRafi walked the piece slowly, as he always did in new spaces, his feet writing letters the grass tried to forget immediately. Anita, who had accepted a slice of lemon drizzle as payment for three men telling her elaborate stories about their knees while she tried to drink her tea, watched him from under a hat borrowed from someone who had been to Goa once and kept a hat to prove it. She had signed off on his return to short runs, and he had been faithful to the metronome when he found it helpful and ignored it when he needed to feel human rather than measured. His father had fallen into the habit, one he tried and failed to make seem accidental, of coming for five minutes when Rafi set up and staying for forty, loitering near the ladder like a man pretending he didn\u2019t know his son would one day climb things with grace.\n\nOf course bunting attempted assassination. Leah had thought she had calculated wind, but bunting, like gossip, finds a draft. At the second run-through a burst of instructional jazz from the band sent a gust along the edge of a wonky gazebo; the string of flags wagged like a warning and then went possessive, wrapping one coloured mouth around the ladder\u2019s third rung. Ty lunged without thinking, Joel grabbed Ty\u2019s shirt to keep him a person rather than a story, and for a second Rafi saw ten possible outcomes and chose, by luck and Anita\u2019s insistence on midfoot, the one where no one\u2019s head met metal. The ladder rang, the flags unlooped in a fit of conscience, and everyone laughed the laugh human throats make to persuade bodies to be calmer than they deserve. The band, oblivious in a way that made Rafi 60% envious and 40% homicidal, completed their phrase and someone cried, \u201cEncore,\u201d in a voice made partly of beer.\n\nWhen he did the piece for the crowd, he did it stripped of the elements that pretended to be magic. It had no fog and less light and still managed to feel like a secret being told by a friend. The audience was a collection of neighbours who had chosen to stand in the sun for longer than was sensible. Babies dozed with their mouths lightly open like held musical notes. Teenagers pretended to be bored and staged their boredom six feet closer than usual. Jim was there, of course, Mavis leashed, the two of them looking as if the day had been invented to give them something to notice. When the ladder rose, the band, perhaps without meaning to, found the chord they\u2019d been reaching for all afternoon and the moment stowed itself away in people\u2019s bodies for later. Afterwards Rafi found grass stuck to his calf and an odd sense that he had been in a room with no walls; he wiped at the grass and told his father without looking, \u201cI didn\u2019t fall,\u201d and his father said, \u201cNo one asked you to jump,\u201d and then, almost at the same time, they both smiled like men who had shared a joke they would not waste by saying aloud too much.\n\nAt the stall where honesty boxes did brisk trade and dishonesty had the day off, an old coach from Loughborough approached with a hesitancy that either age or memory had given him. It wasn\u2019t Lo. It was the other one, from a year when Rafi had come to a track with numbers in his head and had left with the numbers redrawn. The man still had a stopwatch on his wrist like a stubborn watchman. He said Rafi\u2019s name with a question mark and then explained who he had been in case time had scrubbed the chalk lines of hierarchy from both their minds. He did not apologise. Men like him rarely apologise; they make observations and hope you will read the apology there. He said, \u201cYou found your way,\u201d and then, because he could not resist categorisation even now, asked, \u201cDo you think you\u2019re happy?\u201d Rafi had been prepared for judgement or a story that returned the old man to the centre of the lane. He had not been prepared for a question that had managed to shed most of its self-interest. He answered simply, because there are times to be plain. \u201cMore than I thought I would be when I was twenty-one,\u201d he said. The man nodded once, sharp, like a pencil being set against paper, and went to buy a slice of Battenberg as if sugar could move blood where apology would not go.\n\nLeah had been offered a commission before the fair, and it had sat in her bag all morning like a folded bird. A dance company in Leeds wanted a design for a piece about women and patience. They had said the words budget and time frame like people who were careful and brave, and Leah had spent an hour composing an email that would make it clear she was not going to be the kind of designer who tolerated purple unless it had earned it. Rafi found her behind the coconut shy peering at her phone with the intensity that suggests both delight and the start of trouble. She told him at once because she had learned, from months and a kitchen table, that the work only grew well if it was said out loud early. He said the thing he had had to learn to say when his bones insisted he protect himself from loss: \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cDo it. We\u2019ll grow the other bit like we\u2019ve been growing it: with tea and cardboard and other people\u2019s rooms. We can be both.\u201d The coconut shy man overheard and shouted, \u201cBoth!\u201d at the exact moment someone knocked a coconut into the grass and the stall let out a whoop that passed for approval.\n\nPracticality followed them home like a good-natured dog. They sat at the kitchen table and agreed, between porridge and emails and Maya\u2019s list of what could be frozen, that they would make themselves into a structure other people could understand and give money to. A very nice man at the council had used the letters C and I and C in a particular order and handed them a leaflet that smelled of seriousness. Community interest looked good on them; it was the description they had been fumbling for when asked, on forms that welcomed verbs and then punished their use, what they were for. They wrote a name down that made them both grin and then hesitate in case names were fragile. Leah tested Breath & Ladder out loud and the room did not object; Rafi tried Lanes & Ladders and hated the sibilance; Maya said she liked Ouse Right with a little laugh at her own audacity; in the end, because it was exactly halfway between earnest and silly, they chose Small Rooms Company and added, in small letters, and Wide Breaths so that the people who had been at the library would feel recognised. His father drew up a budget on squared paper like a man planning to tile, and when they told him he could be a director if he liked, he declined and then accepted because the word director sounded like a chair and he had always wanted to sit down for a living.\n\nAnita added a slow 10k to his plan. The point was not the time, she said, and then put a number on the paper that was roughly his time and he pretended not to see her trick. He hated the idea of a bib pinned to his shirt and a clock playing god and he agreed anyway because the event would raise money for the hall\u2019s new heaters and he had started to understand that personal ethos had to be porous enough to let other people in. They made it into a village thing so it would not swallow him; Jim raised his hand at a meeting in the back of the pub and volunteered to be in charge of signage, which meant that the route would be marked by bits of cardboard attached to lampposts at shoulder height for a man who had broken mass-produced measures into pieces and preferred his own. Ty and Joel ran two miles and walked one and then, without confessing it counted, ran another. Rafi\u2019s father refused to be timed and walked with the man from the butcher, the two of them discussing the politics of mince. Maya walked the last hundred metres diagonally because she refused to be shepherded by tape and the finish line judge, who had been told her job mattered, tried to scowl at her and could not. Rafi found himself at a pace that let him see faces and road and the sky, and finished upright with his knee unmutinied and his chest warm with the ordinary human ache of doing something you could do without harm.\n\nKaia\u2019s voice arrived through a phone and also, increasingly, in person with cake. The festival had outgrown its original name without noticing and was now a quilt of places and people\u2014library corners, school halls, a skate park that insisted on being part of the arts whether anyone liked it or not. She asked Rafi and Leah if they would curate a strand. Curate sounded like a word that required hats; they said yes because what it mostly meant in Kaia\u2019s mouth was, \u201cChoose people you want to listen to and then make other people listen to them too.\u201d They sat with lists and thought of a woman whose hands told jokes before her mouth did, and a man who played a hurdy-gurdy as if the machine had modern feelings, and a boy who could make mathematics on a whiteboard sound like jazz. Rafi discovered that inviting is a kind of art, and also that cancelling is too, because a mime got a gig in Spain that would pay for his sister\u2019s operation and they had to find someone in a day who could hold quiet like water; he learned to breathe around other people\u2019s emergencies and his own instinct to solve what should only be held.\n\nThe first proper stumble belonged to Ty. Trouble is rarely a lion; it\u2019s a wasp you ignore until your thigh wears it. He didn\u2019t arrive at three on a Thursday. He did not message. Leah, who had taken to assuming the best because it kept the room warmer, waited until twenty past and then sent a line that sounded like a joke and was not. Rafi\u2019s gut did its old twist, the one that sat behind his belly button and listened for the squeal of brakes. Ty turned up Saturday with an apology that had been made brittle by another adult\u2019s voice somewhere else. He had been stopped with a friend by a man in a store who took boys with hoods to be a pair rather than two. There had been an argument that could have been a cautionary tale and was, in the end, just an argument with a notice attached in biro to his day. He had the shaky look of a person who did not want his mouth to open because if it did it might let water out. Rafi did not give him a speech. He gave him the ladder and told him to check the bolts, an act of trust that worked on things and people both. Leah made tea like it was a ribbon you could pull through a knot. They sat late after the hall had emptied and Ty told them, skirting detail as if it were a puddle, about his nan who had not left the sofa for days when the news was bad, and about a teacher who had said his name gently once and then never again, and about the small nobility of not doing something terrible when your body is insisting that velocity is the only salve. Rafi\u2019s father found out, because mothers and halls tell fathers the things proper pride tries to hide, and he turned up Monday morning with a toolbox and asked Ty to help him make a trolley hook fit the ladder. Ty learned to drill in a way that would not put more holes in the universe than necessary and the next time the man in the hardware gave them discount, he did it looking at Ty like they had both agreed to be surprised.\n\nRosanna\u2019s email was both courteous and, as always, late. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking of a \u2018where are they now,\u2019\u201d she wrote, and he could hear the line producer\u2019s chaos in the white space between her words. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing, we\u2019d love to point a camera at you that isn\u2019t purple.\u201d He would have said no if it were the old show, the one with glitter that climbed into your hair and slept there, but Rosanna came with a history of saying the right thing when no one was listening and following through anyway. He sent a list back like someone who had finally learned to use asking not as a weapon but as a sieve: the library, the hall, Anita\u2019s clinic if she was willing, Yvonne\u2019s canteen for the stew and the laugh, Flo if she could be coaxed off another show into daylight. Rosanna said yes to all of it in three emails he could tell had been typed while walking. The crew came with equipment that made the hall feel small and important. They filmed Rafi and Leah chalking without asking what possessed them to still use chalk. They filmed Ty choosing tape and being in the room without performing being in the room. They filmed Anita explaining knees to a camera in the exact same tone she had explained them to Rafi and the cameraman rubbed his knee afterwards without knowing why. Yvonne talked them into thirds at the table and delivered to camera a sermon on eating that made the sound man look like he had remembered his grandmother in Karachi telling him off with love. Flo stood in the doorway, taped off a square of floor because sometimes ritual needs to be literal, and spoke two sentences about safety that had four different kinds of love in them if you had a good ear.\n\nThe cut, when it aired, was decent. There were still shots of his face that made him want to punch the person who had decided to pause on that frame, but the rooms had won. The library\u2019s silence and then its chosen noise did their work. The village hall looked like the kind of place sensible people love without saying so in case someone raises the rent. The internet did as it does\u2014spat, sang, remembered, forgot\u2014and in the middle of it there were messages from people who had also found breath in small rooms and would like to find it again. Maya watched with a cushion, habit not broken by familiarity. His father pretended he was doing something with screws and then laughed too loud at a joke that wasn\u2019t one. Leah took his hand and squeezed once at the moment where the ladder rose and the camera did not add thunder, and he discovered that the simplest thing compliments can do is show up in the right amount at the right time and no more.\n\nThey took the piece to the river that month because it had been asking. The council approved it with a paragraph about safety that made Leah grateful and Rafi smug. They chose dusk because some things should not be attempted at noon. Flo came even without being paid\u2014later she and Leah would argue in good humour about that\u2014and put cones where cones would do more than brand a space. People arrived with jackets though it was warm, because English skin never trusts a day\u2019s kindness. The Ouse pretended to be still the way dogs pretend. Bats stitched the sky with the neatness of small intent. The ladder, placed on the embankment this time, learned a new humility; water changes objects and asks them to become their outlines rather than their bulk. A boy no taller than the ladder\u2019s first rung made a beeline for it because human is human, and Ty stepped in with a hand on his shoulder that was soft as a stop sign. The boy allowed himself to be turned aside and believed for a second that he had allowed it; Rafi loved them both for the negotiation. He ran along the rubber of the path and onto the grass and let the piece do what it did when space is more than room. When the ladder rose the surface of the river took a long celebratory breath and made a copy of the rung that shook a little, as if the water shared a sense of humour with the wind. Someone on the far bank whistled. Someone nearer sang one note without meaning to and then, embarrassed, stopped. It was enough.\n\nAfterwards, Jim told him a story about his wife he had not told anyone else in this town. It involved a ladder that was not metaphorical and an argument about whether she should be allowed to paint the second storey of a house she had decided was shabby in a way that hurt her feelings. Jim had refused her, on the sensible grounds that bodies fall, and she had gone up anyway because she despised shabby more than gravity. She had not fallen. She had waved down at him triumphantly, and then a gust had reminded her that even the triumphant have to come down with steadiness, and in the coming down they had learned, in one short ragged minute, about patience together. He handed Rafi a collar then, Mavis\u2019s first when she had been small and the world bigger, old leather softened to the point of memory. \u201cFor the back of the stage,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you remember to go gentle even when going clever.\u201d Rafi promised the collar a nail and the future a nod.\n\nThere were days of pure administration thick as custard. The CIC paperwork ate an afternoon and left grease on their fingers anyway. They chose a bank with less suspicion than was wise because the woman behind the counter had lashes that felt honest. Insurance asked new questions that suggested someone had sent a memo about creative risk from an office with no chairs. Leah began a spreadsheet and startled herself by loving it. Rafi learned to say invoice without grimacing and to write the words \u201cpro bono\u201d on a line and not feel like he had set himself on fire. The word \u201ctour\u201d lost its glamour and grew a spine and still felt like a word worth pushing.\n\nOn a Tuesday when the hall felt especially like a church and a shed, Leah kissed him without workshop lighting or borrowed applause. She had been moving a lamp, then stopped moving it, then forgot she had meant to find a better angle, and he was leaning against the stage in the way that meant his knee was behaving and his head was full of lists. It didn\u2019t feel like a confession or a line in a longer piece; it felt like discovering that breath has texture in winter. They did not ruin it with questions about always. They did not write it on paper. They did what people do when the world is large and the kitchen is small\u2014they made tea and talked about nothing for fifteen minutes and then went back to placing tape because love is rarely glamorous when it is useful.\n\nAnita added jumps back in small rude parcels like a teacher handing back homework with a smirk. He argued his way down from five to three and she let him win because it didn\u2019t matter and would make him obedient about something that did. The metronome, insulted, flirted with his pockets anyway. His run routes widened by half fields at a time. He found himself keeping company with a fox one morning, the animal floating along the hedgerow with that air foxes have of understanding bureaucracy and rejecting it. He ran past a man teaching a small child to fly a kite in a wind that was technically there and practically not, and the child accepted this as a triumph. He stopped on the bridge and leaned over and saw a yellow bucket lodged under the bank like proof that even plastic wanted a quiet life sometimes.\n\nOn a Thursday that smelt of rain but was not yet wet, Ty\u2019s nan came to the hall. She had on a cardigan with bobbles and the kind of handbag every British woman seems to acquire at fifty. She had made mango pickle that would have caused a diplomatic incident if it had been shown to certain delicate palates. She gave it to Maya with instructions Maya pretended not to know already, and then she sat and watched her grandson lift a box in the right way. She said almost nothing. When she left, she patted Rafi\u2019s hand twice in the way hands do when they are choosing thrift with their words. The next day Ty turned up early and asked, in the tone of someone trying to convince himself this question had occurred to him before he slept, \u201cIs there a thing like this I could learn to do, like, as a job?\u201d Rafi had been waiting for the question since he\u2019d met him and did not show Ty the joy and panic it produced. He said, too casually, that people paid other people to make things safe and visible, that there were courses where you learned to wrangle light or ladders or people, that being the one with the tape could be a life. Leah, who had already Googled three courses and written down the open days, said, \u201cLet\u2019s start with shadowing. Then let\u2019s start with emails. You don\u2019t have to say please to anything except deadlines.\u201d\n\nThat night, when the field behind the hall had finally been persuaded by hay-making to smell like childhood, they put on their coats and went to the embankment without agreeing to. The Perseids had been promised and like all promised things in England came later than advertised. They lay on the slope like children and tried to call stars by names they would answer to. The meteor shower was less a shower and more the occasional streak that made you question whether your eye was inventing. That was fine; they had come for the excuse to look up. They talked about how long they could do small if small stayed interesting. They talked about rooms that were trying to find them and rooms they were trying to find. They talked about how many ladders a person should own and whether flares counted as pyro and Leah said yes and Rafi said no and it was not a dealbreaker. Leah\u2019s head found his shoulder and stayed there until the damp suggested home. They stood and flicked grass from each other\u2019s backs and made promises they did not speak, which are sometimes the only kind worth making.\n\nThey declared, the next week, a Sabbath of feet. They cancelled a showing without shame and wrote on the hall door a note explaining that rest is part of all good training plans. They put their phones in a drawer and let them sulk. They walked to the shop for milk as if the milk were in another country and found on the way three people they loved and two they avoided because even rest days must include reality. They sat in the garden with their toes out and watched the sky make a good-faith effort at blue. Maya brought out tea and pretended to forget to bring out biscuits so that they would have to come inside and talk to her for a minute. His father oiled the trolley wheels because idleness is a sin to some and a gift to others and he was not ready to join the latter.\n\nAt the end of the rest day, the kind of quiet tiredness that is different from exhaustion settled over his body like a blanket properly tucked. He lay in bed aware of the heat left by the day. Somewhere outside a fox considered bins with philosophical seriousness. He thought of the library with Mr. Dalton\u2019s signs that had been moved and his slightly affronted face; of the prison where a man had learned that raising your hand did not always cost you; of Kaia\u2019s kitchen where pies were made into programming; of Anita\u2019s gel and metronome and hands that left his knee better than they had found it; of Flo\u2019s tape like a boundary and a blessing; of Yvonne\u2019s jars with their labels like small graffiti on a generous wall; of the river making a mirror for his risk and being kind about it. He thought about the scribbled paper where strangers had left their breath stories and realised he was becoming the keeper of other people\u2019s little truths.\n\nBefore he slept, he wrote one sentence on the whiteboard Leah had fixed to the kitchen wall for lists and poems and rats of genius that scuttled at night. He wrote it slowly so as not to wake anything fragile. Keep it small and bright. In the morning Maya would underline it once and his father would circle the word bright with a small arrow that pointed to the window and Leah would draw a ladder so tiny you could almost climb it with a fingertip. Then the mist would come off the Ouse as if it had been invented brand new and they would lace their shoes and go to the hall where chalk made its constellations and people became brave at the same time with the same air.",
