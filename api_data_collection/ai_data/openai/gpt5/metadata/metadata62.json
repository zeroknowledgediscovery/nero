     "novel_text": "The morning Rowena Leigh decided to be late for everything, the town had decided to be early. The buses came too soon, the postie knocked at nine instead of ten, and the gulls had already made off with half the bread meant for the ducks in Memorial Gardens. The church bells practised and then seemed to lose interest midway, pealing into an embarrassed hush that matched the colour of the clouds. Crawley was like that: concrete and kind, proud and awkward, not one thing or the other. Rowena loved it precisely for that.\n\nShe waited under the yew by the war memorial, a paper cup of tea warming her hands, watching an old man with a terrier try to negotiate a bin bag into a reluctant bin. A violinist set up by the railings and played a slow waltz to nobody and everybody. The sky had the pale look of a kettle just before it boils. Her phone buzzed again and she ignored it, because her finely honed instinct for emergency had told her none of these calls were bleeding out onto a pavement. They were meetings and numbers. Things that could be done in an hour, after she fed the ducks.\n\nA young lad sat down on the opposite bench and tried to pretend he hadn\u2019t recognised her. He was taller than last year, voice deeper, hair even carefully ragged. \u201cHey, Ms Leigh,\u201d he said, finally giving up the pretence and leaning forward, elbows on his knees. \u201cYou didn\u2019t come to the presentation. I wanted to\u2014 I mean they said I ought to say thank you properly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare Ms Leigh me, Mark. That\u2019s for school and courtrooms.\u201d She crossed the path and handed him half a sandwich wrapped in greaseproof paper. \u201cAnd you did the work. The bursary\u2019s a bit of scaffolding. You climbed.\u201d\n\nHe looked at the sandwich like it might be ceremonial. \u201cHam?\u201d\n\n\u201cTomato and cheese. No ham. You\u2019re the one who gave me a lecture about processed meat and nitrates.\u201d\n\nHe laughed. \u201cI went back to bacon, actually. Uni\u2019ll do that to a person.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this you telling me it\u2019s all been wasted? That you\u2019re dropping out to become a meat influencer on the internet?\u201d\n\nHe shook his head, swallowing too fast. \u201cSecond year\u2019s harder. But\u2026 I\u2019m going to stick it out. I like it there. That library. And there\u2019s this theatre on campus\u2014never thought I\u2019d say that but yeah.\u201d He looked down, then up again, the shy comes and goes. \u201cMy mum\u2019s not sleeping. Says she misses the washing. The noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll pass. People miss the work of love, that\u2019s all. And they get used to holding it differently.\u201d She sat beside him and they watched the violinist build the waltz into something that tugged at the ribs. The terrier succeeded with the bin bag, emerging triumphant. After the sandwich was gone, Mark wiped his hands on his jeans. \u201cYou\u2019ll come to the open day? For the community centre. You paid the money, so you get to cut the ribbon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come and not cut any ribbons,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll hold the ribbon if the mayor insists on cutting things. And I\u2019ll nick a cup of tea if they\u2019re giving them away.\u201d\n\nHe told her about a director who wore the same scarf every day and a lad who\u2019d joined the Afro-Caribbean society despite being from Chichester and pale as a ghost. He told her his mother had started watching dance videos on her phone and called her to narrate them, breathless. What are those moves, son. They got names? The violinist\u2019s bow found a little ache in the morning, and without deciding to, Rowena stood and let the music turn her bones into a metronome. A step to the left, a sweep, just a mutter of a turn. It was nothing. It was everything.\n\n\u201cYou dance?\u201d Mark asked, mock astonishment. \u201cWho knew.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo-one,\u201d she said, sitting back down. \u201cThat\u2019s the trick.\u201d\n\nBy the time she made it to the office above the bakery on the High Street, the phones were sulking in their cradle and the smell of cinnamon had become an argument you couldn\u2019t win. The door stuck, as always. She loved that it stuck. The Leigh Trust had tried fancy spaces with polished floors and potted palms, and they had wilted on Rowena like poor gold bracelets. Here, with its peeling paint and the constant rumble of ovens below, the money went out the door within minutes of arriving. That soothed her.\n\n\u201cFinally,\u201d said Priya, without looking up. \u201cYour inbox is full and then some. And I\u2019ve already told them yes about the playground, so you can\u2019t swoop in and play the generous patron. Also, your dentist called. Twice.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy teeth are perfect. The rest of me is falling apart, but my teeth are\u2026well. They exist.\u201d She hung her coat on the back of the door and kissed the air beside Priya\u2019s cheek, the ritual done briskly. Priya had been with her eight years. She could smell when a grant application was lying. She could carry three cups of coffee and a laptop up the stairs without spilling a drop. She had a laugh that made other laughs sprout.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a man coming at eleven about the youth orchestra,\u201d Priya said, flipping through her notebook. \u201cHe says they need instruments, not just reeds, which is a very interesting way to ask for trumpets.\"\n\n\u201cAnd flutes,\u201d Rowena said. \u201cI know a flautist who makes old ones sing again. She\u2019ll have a cupboard full of orphans looking for young lungs.\u201d She smiled at the bakery smell and then at the clock. \u201cRight. Tell me the worst thing first.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe worst thing is also the best thing,\u201d Priya said. \u201cWhich is your brand, really. Do you want to sit for this? You\u2019re not going to sit, I can tell. Ok\u2014channel five, Sunday nights, low stakes but surprisingly moving. The South Downs Step. They want you.\u201d\n\nRowena blinked. \u201cThey want my money? Or they want me to be the stern judge who wears a lot of sparkly knitwear and says I\u2019m afraid that wasn\u2019t quite it, darling?\u201d\n\nPriya grinned, catlike. \u201cThey want you. You you. On the dancefloor you. I made noises. They made noises back. Apparently they do this every year: they pick a community person who\u2019s known in the region and pair them with a pro. You don\u2019t have to go through the heats. It\u2019s for the final. It\u2019s a whole\u2026they make a montage. You looking at Crawley from Tilgate Park. You in a taxi. You attempt to learn to\u2026spin. You cry a little at something wholesome. Then you dance.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t cry,\u201d Rowena said, and then had to look away. She\u2019d never been asked to be in anything. She was the one who arranged things. Who moved the chairs and counted the raffle tickets and smoothed the sleeves of nervous teenagers. The idea of someone moving a light towards her made her feel faint and foolish and twelve.\n\n\u201cDo you want it?\u201d Priya asked, softer. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to say yes. Say no and I\u2019ll send them a lovely email saying we admire what they do but Miss Leigh is swamped. By good deeds. Up to her eyeballs in good deeds.\u201d\n\nRowena\u2019s hands did something silly. Then her mouth followed. \u201cI want it,\u201d she heard herself say, the sentence landing like a coin in a wishing well. She felt the ripple inward. \u201cThat\u2019s not the sensible answer but it\u2019s the right one. My mother used to say I had itchy feet.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe meant travel, I think,\u201d Priya said.\n\n\u201cShe meant I danced in the kitchen until the sugar fell off the doughnuts,\u201d Rowena said. \u201cCall them back. Say yes. See if they can keep the cameras out of my bathroom.\u201d\n\nPriya picked up her mobile, still grinning. \u201cWe\u2019ve set a precedent now. The bathroom is sacred. I\u2019ll tell them you\u2019re allergic to loo roll.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell them I\u2019m allergic to the idea of seeing my profile in high definition.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a very noble nose,\u201d Priya said, dialling. \u201cI have it on good authority.\u201d She waited for the line to connect. \u201cHi, yes, this is Priya from the Leigh Trust. We have an answer. Yes. The good one.\u201d\n\nRowena turned towards the bakery window, where a tray of iced buns glowed like a school art project. Her heart beat too hard. This was ridiculous. She had been in boardrooms with men who\u2019d calloused their smiles. She had been in courtrooms with mothers who had no English, holding their children like burning coal. She had been on slow trains with drunk girls and on fast trains with posh boys and she had never once thought there would be a lens pointed at her to capture some small part of her not for proof or protection, but for delight.\n\nHer phone chimed with a text from an unknown number: Hi Rowena, this is Kiki from The South Downs Step. So thrilled you\u2019re on board! We\u2019ll arrange your pro partner today and get you two in a studio ASAP. Also, we\u2019d love to get some location shots around Crawley, maybe your favourite places? x\n\nPriya caught her expression. \u201cWe are in the bit where your life gets b-roll.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy favourite places,\u201d Rowena murmured, thinking of the foot of the old oak in Tilgate and the grubby side alley where the youth club stored its chairs, and the little bridge over the stream that no-one noticed until they\u2019d lost something under it. \u201cDo they want glamour or true?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe sell them true. Give them glamour as garnish.\u201d\n\nThe man from the youth orchestra came with a binder and a willingness to cry on cue, which she appreciated in others and avoided in herself. He had a list of the children who shared violins and the one trombone that made a noise like an elephant with sinusitis. They gave him money to go buy brass and wood, not reeds. She reminded him to keep receipts and pride. He left with eyes shining.\n\nAt eleven-thirty, Rowena\u2019s dentist called a third time and left a message that used the word urgent and also floss, which seemed contradictory. At twelve-fifteen, the bakery sent up four custard slices that tried to convince her she was twenty-five. At one, Priya waved her phone in the doorway. \u201cPro partner,\u201d she said, stage whisper. \u201cI know you wanted someone shorter than you. Or taller. I can\u2019t remember which.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted someone who doesn\u2019t mind being disappointment adjacent,\u201d Rowena said. She put her pen down. \u201cTell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cJonah Hale. He\u2019s done three seasons. The one with the arms,\u201d Priya said. \u201cHe used to be in a company in Manchester before he did this. Everyone says he\u2019s very kind, which is code for unambiguously hot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need unambiguously hot. I need someone who will not complain when I step on his foot as if I\u2019m trying to kill him with only my heel.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will be brilliant,\u201d Priya said, as if it were a fact like the weather. \u201cThey\u2019ve booked you in at Studio 12 on Church Lane, starting tomorrow morning. Ten o\u2019clock. I\u2019ll pick you up if you like. I\u2019ll bring a broom for you to cling to like a partner when he goes for water.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not cling,\u201d Rowena protested. Then she remembered the way she\u2019d clung to herself since she was a girl and, privately, allowed the sentence to soften. \u201cAll right, a little clinging.\u201d\n\nThat afternoon was lost to the kind of practicalities that made her feel steadied: line items in a spreadsheet, a message to the borough council about lighting in a car park, a short argument with a bricklayer about the dignity of a bench. She signed things without fanfare. She answered two emails from people who assumed the Trust was hers like a handbag and gently told them it belonged to them, in the way a library belongs to everyone. The thought of tomorrow kept slipping in like sunlight at the edge of a door.\n\nShe walked home through Tilgate Park when the day had cooled and the families had evacuated in tides, pushing buggies loaded as if for emigration. Dogs compared lives. She took the long way, along the lake, and tried not to imagine music stepping in time beside her. A man in a fleece tried to get a kite to rise and failed beautifully. She wanted to tell him she understood.\n\nHer mother\u2019s house smelled of the past in a way that wasn\u2019t sad. Jean Leigh had made everything in her life look like thrift and feel like feast. The clock ticked too loud in the hallway and the carpet had a pattern which had outlasted fashion by being stubborn and red. Her mother was sitting with a book in the conservatory when Rowena kissed the top of her head. \u201cYou look restless,\u201d Jean said. \u201cLike your shoes want to leave your feet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done something,\u201d Rowena said, too casually. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI stopped minding on your thirteenth birthday. Didn\u2019t see the point after you dyed your hair blue and jumped off the garage roof into a paddling pool.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat pool broke my spirit and also my tailbone.\u201d She poured two glasses of elderflower and tried to look uninteresting. \u201cI\u2019m going to be on a television programme about dancing. Just for one night. It\u2019s for a good cause. They do a segment on what we do here\u2014the bursary, the club, the food pantry thing at St. Mark\u2019s. And I will dance, and then I will go home and be ordinary again.\u201d\n\nJean\u2019s eyebrows did a slow waltz of their own. \u201cYou could never be ordinary if you tried. Who\u2019s your partner?\u201d\n\n\u201cA man named Jonah with arms,\u201d Rowena said, and they both laughed the way they always laughed when Rowena admitted attraction out loud, like it was a bird that might fly away if you startled it. \u201cI should have told you before I said yes, but you would have told me to say yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would. I might have said it very softly so as not to scare you off.\u201d Jean\u2019s weathered hand patted Rowena\u2019s knee. \u201cI remember that ankle of yours turning when you did a spin on the old lino. You were furious your body had borders.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt still does,\u201d Rowena said, without bitterness. She looked at her mother, at the woman who had waited tables while learning to be a nurse while raising a daughter. \u201cNo advice?\u201d\n\n\u201cWear shoes that tell the truth,\u201d Jean said. \u201cSmile as if you mean it. If you fall, fall like it\u2019s choreography. And don\u2019t let them cut your hair for telly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t touch my hair,\u201d Rowena said, a hand moving to guard the wild wave of it, half silver now. \u201cI\u2019ve become very attached to being unruly.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Being tidy is for cupboards.\u201d\n\nThat night she slept as if someone else had hired the moon to watch over her. She woke at four to a train of thoughts that refused to obey signals: I can\u2019t, what if, yes you can, you\u2019re being ridiculous, you\u2019re almost forty-six, forty-six is not a number that means you must. She got up and made tea. She went back to bed and dreamed of being late to a wedding where she was both bride and aunt and no-one else minded.\n\nThe studio on Church Lane had been a kissing booth for light in some other century. The windows were so tall it felt like standing in a throat, about to sing. There were scuffs along the bottom of the mirrors where generations of shoes had learned to be bewildered. A pot plant in the corner was clearly on the brink of deciding. Two girls in leggings watched their reflections negotiate being human. The receptionist looked at Rowena like she was an aunt who might bring biscuits later. \u201cStudio 2 for you,\u201d she said. \u201cJonah\u2019s on his way, he\u2019s just parking. You can go in and\u2026stretch? Or stand and wonder what you were thinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am superb at wondering what I was thinking,\u201d Rowena said. \u201cI could win a medal in that, if there were medals for it.\u201d She changed into the trousers Priya had insisted were flattering and the top that did not show too much of anything. She left her street shoes by the door and put on the pair she\u2019d bought back when she convinced herself salsa would be her next soft addiction. The leather creaked approval.\n\nJonah came in like a word you\u2019d half forgotten. Built like someone who had carried heavy groceries through snow for a stranger. He had hair that couldn\u2019t decide whether to behave and a smile that made people believe in minor gods. He offered his hand without showing off. \u201cRowena,\u201d he said, as if it were a name he knew from some better story. \u201cI\u2019m Jonah. I am so glad you\u2019re doing this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am too,\u201d she said, and then, in a whisper she hoped didn\u2019t travel, \u201cMost of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can work with most.\u201d He looked her over the way a seamstress looks at a dress. \u201cCan I ask what you love? In dance. Not what you can do, not yet. What music makes your knees think about floating?\u201d\n\nShe thought about kitchens and late night radio, about the solitary ritual of a glass of red and a song that makes washing up a ceremony. \u201cA waltz when nobody\u2019s watching. A tango when every ghost is. I like a little\u2026lean. Why am I telling you this?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you came to let your body tell some truths,\u201d he said, then clapped once. \u201cOk. We have three weeks. In TV time, that is the blink of a thing that blinks. The final is an event: you\u2019ll be with three other couples, a live band, lights that will try to eat you, and judges who will tell you how brave you are. We are going to give them more than brave.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have braved worse,\u201d she said, and the words slipped out before she could tidy them. \u201cNo, scratch that. Don\u2019t put it in the package. We don\u2019t need tragedy. I don\u2019t want pity cheques.\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard you give away money like confetti,\u201d he said, a graceful change of subject. \u201cAnd that you make people think the confetti was theirs all along.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am merely a redirect. I point a river in a better direction,\u201d she said. Then, because she could feel her own pompousness like a rash, she added, \u201cAlso, I am not above weeping in a meeting if it gets a youth orchestra a tuba. Please don\u2019t make me do that in glitter.\u201d\n\nHe grinned. \u201cWe will not weep. We will sweat and laugh and swear a bit. Most of the swearing will happen in your head.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am prepared,\u201d she said, rolling her shoulders. \u201cShow me how to not murder your toes.\u201d\n\nThey started with a frame: the arm under her shoulder blades like a promise and a question. He guided her into the first turn and back, then forward, then into a place where, for three seconds, everything was shade and light, and her feet obeyed her even though they had spent years on more solid jobs. She tripped once and then twice, and apologised only for the second one because she was learning that apologising for gravity was a habit she could kick.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look there,\u201d he said gently, touching his own chest. \u201cLook over my shoulder. As if you can see the door. The one you walk through when you are not doing this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very attached to doors,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI can tell,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cWe\u2019re going to choose music today. Nothing too fast. Something that lets you speak with your shoulders.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we do it in three?\u201d she asked, hopeful. \u201cMy heart counts that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can definitely do it in three,\u201d he said. \u201cIt must be the Crawley in you.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrawley is a waltz town,\u201d she said, with the loyalty that comes from knowing a place did its best with what it had. He had the band\u2019s demos on his phone, and they stood by the window to listen, sharing an earbud like teenagers. She vetoed the obvious songs, the ones that had been on wedding dance floors and in adverts for biscuits. She said no to anything too earnest, too kindly. She chose a piece that had a bit of a smirk, a waltz with grit in it. \u201cThis,\u201d she said, when the strings kicked at the drums.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d Jonah agreed. \u201cWe can build an opening that makes them quiet. Then a turn that earns you a small whoop.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoops are not charitable,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can\u2019t be gifted. You either buy them or\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014or you earn them,\u201d he said. \u201cYes. You\u2019re going to earn several.\u201d\n\nThey practised until her lungs whispered stop. He made her sit down and brought her water and a biscuit from his bag, which told her he had been a boy scout or raised by old women. He told her about the first time he\u2019d danced in a school hall that smelled of cabbage. She told him about the first time she\u2019d danced in a doorway to avoid an argument in the kitchen. He told her about a shoulder that had complained for a year. She told him about a knee that spoke fluent weather.\n\nWhen they finished an hour later than scheduled, he walked her to the door like a gentleman in a book. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked, and he wasn\u2019t asking as a politeness.\n\n\u201cI am quietly on fire,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cGood. Keep the flames small today. Stretch in the bath. I\u2019ll text you the videos so you can practise lying down.\u201d\n\nShe stepped into Crawley\u2019s afternoon with the strange feeling that she was both larger and more transparent. It made queues easier. She could see the curled impatience of the woman at the post office and the waist-high despair of a child whose lollipop had detached from its stick. Love looked like someone turning in the queue to let someone else go first. She let two someones go, then went home where her legs protested in organised and disorganised ways.\n\nThe next morning folded into the one after, the one after. Practise. Grant applications. A visit to the youth club where someone had left a pair of tap shoes on a chair like a joke. A message from Kiki with a schedule of when to sit on benches and stare into middle distance while a drone tried not to crash into pigeons. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking of the bit by the bandstand?\u201d Kiki said in a voice note that was 30 seconds of fizz. \u201cPeople might come up to you, that\u2019s ok, we\u2019ll roll with it. We\u2019ll ask them to sign releases if their hello makes the final cut.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want to film me telling the two old men that they can\u2019t bring beer into the play area?\u201d Rowena replied. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply cinematic. Sometimes they wobble when they realise they\u2019re seventy.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually yes?\u201d Kiki said. \u201cWe want the real. We don\u2019t want the posh version of the real.\u201d\n\nOn the fourth day, the producers had her walk up her own front steps and open her front door as if it were both the first and last time. She took them to meet Jean, who had put on one of her good cardigans and also her normal face. Kiki fell a little in love with her, as everyone did. \u201cDo you ever dance, Jean?\u201d Kiki asked.\n\n\u201cOnce a year in my kitchen on my birthday,\u201d Jean said. \u201cTo a song only I am allowed to sing along to. The singing is terrible.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we\u2014\u201d Kiki began, then stopped. \u201cNo. That\u2019s your moment. We\u2019ll leave you that.\u201d\n\nTheir cameraman, a man named Simon with a scar that bent when he smiled, loved Crawley like a cousin. He made the A23 look poetic. He filmed the roundabout like it was a carousel. He put his camera down to help an elderly woman push her wheelie walker onto the bus. \u201cUse that,\u201d Rowena said, fond. \u201cPut that in the show. It\u2019s better television than anything I will do with my feet.\u201d\n\nThere was one hiccup when, at Studio 2, a woman in a bright tracksuit introduced herself as a contestant\u2014for a second, Rowena thought the word applied to her, and laughed internally at the newness of it\u2014and told her she was brave. The woman was a radio DJ from Worthing, small and sparky, with two dogs on her Instagram and a tattoo that said Begin. She had been in the heats for weeks, she said, and had lost a toenail to ambition. \u201cIt\u2019s worth it,\u201d she promised. \u201cThey do the spray tan even if you\u2019re pale and have no business resembling a satsuma.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m allergic to dyes,\u201d Rowena lied gently.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell them that,\u201d Kiki whispered, as if it were a secret between spies.\n\nThey had a day where nothing worked. Jonah\u2019s shoulder sulked and so did Rowena\u2019s feet. Her stomach went quiet in that bad way which meant sleep was on strike. She left the studio and instead of going straight home, went to the old school where she\u2019d been taught to sit up straight and dream within reason. The caretaker remembered her mother and her hair. He let her into the hall. The floor had been replaced since the last time, but the cheap curtains remained, a shade of green not known in nature. There was the echo. There was the stage where, fourteen, she had danced a number to a song nobody else liked, and where Lydia March had danced next, all brightness and shine and the kind of confident that needs two chairs. Lydia with the laugh that could hang you up to dry. Lydia who had told Rowena that her arms looked heavy and her heart would never float. Lydia who had done everything first and loud.\n\nIt surprised her that she remembered the exact order of things: Lydia\u2019s backbend, the little tick in the music where Rowena had tripped and then pretended the trip was step and nobody had been fooled. She had not thought of Lydia for months. Years. It felt like thinking of an old minor cruelty, the way you press a bruise to see if it still belongs to you. It did. She stood in the quiet school hall and forgave herself for not forgiving Lydia at fourteen, and then forgave Lydia, too, for the sin of believing the world was a mirror.\n\nOn a Friday, Priya came to the studio with an armful of oranges and a notebook. \u201cYou look taller,\u201d she said to Rowena, meaning it. \u201cDid he pull you out like a pencil?\u201d\n\n\u201cI pulled myself out,\u201d Rowena said, and then, embarrassed by the way that sounded, she added, \u201cHe helped.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got a turn you could serve tea on,\u201d Jonah announced, wiping his neck with a towel. \u201cWe did it three times and nothing broke.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare become unbearable,\u201d Priya said to Rowena, who stood there thinking: I won\u2019t. I can\u2019t. It\u2019s too late to become that. Thank god.\n\nIt was Sunday night and the frost had arrived early for once when Priya\u2019s text arrived, tinny and simple:\n\nHave you seen the press release?\n\nRowena was in the kitchen, examining her knees as if they were new. She did not answer for a beat, then: No. Should I?\n\nIt names the final four plus \u201cspecial.\u201d You, DJ woman, footballer\u2019s wife from Hove, that actor from the hospital show\u2026and\n\nShe stood very still, as if movement would summon something, like a ghost or a cat. And?\n\nLydia March.\n\nIt was not that the name itself had magic. It was the way the years between now and then collapsed obediently, like folding chairs after a meeting. The floor under her shifted. Her phone chose that moment to ping with a new message: a link to the announcement, glittering and noisy, with photos that were all teeth and light and heat. Lydia\u2019s was there, a face that had learned to be photogenic from angles and from other people, a smile that said what it had always said: watch me.\n\nRowena put the phone on the counter. She made a cup of tea slowly, as if tea were a solution to all physics. The spoon clinked in the cup and her hand shook once, not enough to spill. Jean came in and stood opposite, reading her daughter\u2019s face the way farmers read the sky.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not the tooth people.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a name,\u201d Rowena said. \u201cIt\u2019s school in a dress. Do you remember Lydia?\u201d\n\nJean\u2019s mouth did the thing it did when she wasn\u2019t going to say anything uncharitable but very much wanted to. \u201cI remember her mother more. The woman who made every school concert a referendum on her daughter\u2019s future fame.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s on the show,\u201d Rowena said. \u201cShe\u2019s in the final. We\u2019re going to share a floor.\u201d\n\nJean sat down. \u201cDo you want to quit?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Rowena said, immediately, and then had to laugh at herself. \u201cI want to win, like a child. Like a silly ridiculous greedy child. And I want to never have to stand by her in a hallway listening to her say something that makes my spine feel\u2026less.\u201d\n\n\u201cWanting to win is not a sin,\u201d Jean said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a feeling. What you do with it is the trick.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could put it into my feet,\u201d Rowena said, and heard Jonah\u2019s voice in her head: into your shoulders, into the whole of you. \u201cI could dance without turning the dance into a weapon.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019re getting clever,\u201d Jean said, smiling, then got up to flick the kettle on again because, in their house, boiling water was as close to a religion as they got. \u201cSit with the feeling. It\u2019s like a cat. If you chase it, it\u2019ll scratch. Let it come to you.\u201d\n\nRowena sat. The room had its old lessons in it. She could smell the Sunday roast ghost. She could hear the tiny hum of the fridge. She would have to write to Kiki and say, I know you like drama, but you can\u2019t have me in a corner making a face every time Lydia speaks. She would have to say to Jonah, don\u2019t change anything because of this. Do not give me extra spin. I will not be a cartoon of triumph.\n\nHer phone lit again, messages flowing in from people who now wanted to hear her say that name, to tell them it meant nothing, that she was beyond it, water off, ducks, backs. Priya\u2019s last text said: breathe. Then: imagine her face when you take a bow.\n\nRowena lay in bed later and pictured that bow. She pictured the work that came before it. She pictured falling, once, and then getting up and folding that into her steps as if it were planned. She pictured Mark at home watching with his mother, who would forget to breathe for the length of the song. She pictured the youth orchestra with shiny trumpets. She pictured a small girl at a kitchen table deciding her arms belonged to her. Lydia\u2019s face floated in the room like an old picture. It faded when she refused to feed it.\n\nThe days that followed were not dramatic. They were full of small almosts. Her body was a calendar of learnings. She bought plasters for parts of herself she never thought could blister. She kept a diary for the first time in years because she needed somewhere to put words that weren\u2019t polite. On a Tuesday, she wrote: today I wanted to throw a chair through a window because my feet refused to believe in the concept of three. On a Wednesday: don\u2019t buy leggings that promise to be encouraging. They lied. On a Thursday: spoke to Lydia in the corridor. She looked at my shoes and told me she had a pair like that when she was ten. I told her I had a pair like this now because I took as long as I liked.\n\nJonah noticed when her moods leaned. He did not fix them. He adjusted the light. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to prove sixteen-year-old you wrong,\u201d he said, when she mistimed a turn and swore in delight just to change the air. \u201cYou only have to show forty-six-year-old you what she already knows.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat she can do two things at once. She can be kind and want to nail this,\u201d he said. \u201cShe can make a face when she sees a name on a list and then decide the face isn\u2019t the final word.\u201d\n\nThey practised with the band. The conductor was built like a lamppost and flirted with everyone. The cellist cried at the bit where the violas rise and then pretend they didn\u2019t. Rowena took the stage not dressed, not lit, just chalk marks and a sense of size. She stood in the wing and imagined the audience like a lake. She breathed. In three. Out three.\n\nThe final would be at the Brighton Dome, which meant they would take Crawley there and make it ours for a night. The producers sent through more schedules and more digital forms where she was asked her height, her weight, and if she had ever broken a bone. She wrote yes and no in the wrong places and had to call Kiki to confess. \u201cI can fill in forms,\u201d she said. \u201cI swear. I\u2019ve filled in a thousand. Today I forgot my own shoe size.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt happens,\u201d Kiki said, voice like a hand on a shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take care of you. You take care of the floor.\u201d\n\nOn the day they tried costumes, the stylist\u2014a man named Andy who could make a string look like cashmere\u2014wanted to put her in pink. \u201cYou\u2019ve got strong skin,\u201d he said. \u201cPink is brave on strong skin.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo to pink,\u201d she said. \u201cI grew up next to a butcher\u2019s. Pink is\u2026meat. I\u2019ll wear blue.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. \u201cBlue it is. With a secret thing that will make the judges lean in. I haven\u2019t decided what yet. Maybe buttons.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t make it a hat,\u201d she begged.\n\n\u201cIt will not be a hat,\u201d he promised, solemn. \u201cI will never make a woman like you wear a hat she did not ask for. We have standards.\u201d\n\nThey brought in Lydia\u2019s couple to practise before them. It wasn\u2019t malice. It was scheduling. But it turned the room into a place with two temperatures. Rowena stood in the corridor and watched. Lydia was as good as she\u2019d assumed. Better. She was precise and bright and carried her body like a correct answer. Her partner did not have Jonah\u2019s steadiness but made up for it with dazzle. The song they used was fast and more fast and then something like a jump. They made the studio feel like it belonged to them.\n\nRowena did not look away. She let the old ache come and sit on her lap and then climb down and curl up by the door. When Lydia came off, they brushed. Lydia\u2019s perfume was new, but the eyes were the same. \u201cYou look\u2026well,\u201d Lydia said, which was the oldest way of not saying anything.\n\n\u201cYou too,\u201d Rowena said. \u201cCongratulations on making it to the final.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t luck,\u201d Lydia said, without irony.\n\n\u201cNothing ever is,\u201d Rowena replied, and went into Studio 2 with her feet loud in her shoes. Jonah raised an eyebrow at her, the kind that asks a dozen questions at once, then crossed the room to take her hands.\n\nThe first turn was wrong. The second was honest. The third started where her shoulder met his palm and ended where the music\u2019s joke lived. The waltz made room. It felt, for the first time, less like trying and more like remembering. Outside, the sky was the same paling kettle. Inside, they made their water boil.The night settled over Crawley as if it had been trained, a slow draw of dimness that left the bakery\u2019s windows warm and the buses lit like aquariums. Rowena floated home with the odd sensation that the pavements had grown a size. In bed she lined up her aches and assigned them names like you would to plants on a windowsill. The left calf was Determination. The right shoulder was Pride With Questions. The ankle she had once ruined for a summer was Caution Wearing a Flirt\u2019s Dress. She woke to drumming rain and a text from Kiki with the kind of cheer that can only be achieved by a woman who lives on spreadsheets and hope: Today: Memorial Gardens for b-roll + quick vox pops. Wear something weather-proof but not sad. x\n\nBy ten she was under the same yew by the war memorial, the rain having decided on a compromise drizzle. Simon had a rain cover over the camera that made it look like he was coaxing a shy animal. Kiki had a baseball cap, lipstick the colour of cherries, and a clipboard whose elastic bands had migrated south. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get you feeding ducks because I\u2019m not an idiot,\u201d she said, handing Rowena a bag of torn bread that had clearly been purchased for this exact purpose. \u201cAnd the violin man\u2019s here again, which is either luck or fate or the BBC spying on us. Do you mind? We\u2019ll give him twenty quid and an angelic glow.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll buy his terrier a coat,\u201d Rowena said, and turned to see the old man from days before negotiating a fresh bin liner. The terrier looked at Simon\u2019s lens with suspicion, then decided it had bigger existential questions. People slowed when they recognised her, which still made her want to turn to check if someone more deserving was behind her. They used her name, and then some didn\u2019t and called her love, and she loved them for that small democracy. A teenager with a skateboard asked if she was famous yet and if she\u2019d still come to Youth Night on Thursdays. \u201cI\u2019m allergic to Thursdays,\u201d she said solemnly. \u201cI only go because pickle crisps are cheaper then.\u201d\n\nKiki guided her into a scene with the practiced kindness of a woman who has coaxed stories out of shy mechanics and angry vicars. \u201cLook past the bridge,\u201d she said, and Simon lowered himself into a crouch that revealed a surprising grace for a man who wore boots. \u201cTalk about what you think when you\u2019re here.\u201d Rowena resisted the urge to say mostly I think about bread mould. She spoke instead about remembering names, about the second bench on the left where a boy had told her he could hear his father\u2019s voice if he sat very still, about the way the water did you the favour of pretending to be interesting so you could stop pretending to be strong.\n\nAn older woman with a shopping trolley approached to ask if she should say something into the camera because she had a grandson who made beats and sometimes needed money for software. They signed a waiver on the damp lid of a bin. The violinist tried a tune that was almost a reel and almost a lullaby and Rowena\u2019s head acknowledged the rhythm without her permission. \u201cGive me thirty seconds of tiny dance,\u201d Kiki whispered. \u201cKitchen size.\u201d Rowena did not want to. She did it anyway. It felt like letting a cat out of a carrier after too long in a car, each step cautious and then inevitable, small enough not to tempt fate, real enough to satisfy it.\n\nJonah texted a photograph of his shoes next to a kettle. The caption said: Hydration. Also, I am stretching. Please imagine my virtue. She sent him the violinist, half a blur of bow, and the terrier with bread in a guilty mouth. He sent back a line that felt like the beginning of something and the continuation of something else: Remember to keep your breath where your heart can reach it.\n\nAt Studio 2 that afternoon, a notice had been taped to the door in marker pen: No fake tan in the toilets. It read like poetry and made everyone behave. Jonah had rigged a line of tape across the floor to teach her floorcraft, which he insisted was not dark magic but could look like it if you were watching from a balcony. \u201cThe trick,\u201d he said, \u201cis to know that you own any space your feet have already promised to. You can\u2019t buy it once you\u2019re in it. You purchase it three steps ahead with intent.\u201d\n\n\u201cProperty law is much more fun when you put it like that,\u201d she said, attempting a drift that did not look like a broom trying to decide. \u201cWhat happens when someone else has promised the same space?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you speak more loudly with your waist,\u201d he said, the kind of sentence he could not have uttered in a past that involved paperwork. \u201cAnd if they still don\u2019t listen, you smile as if you meant to be almost-murdered and you make a new plan on the spot.\u201d He told her a story about a gala where a footballer had blundered into their line and he had had to turn a waltz into a polite fight without losing the three. She confessed she had once written an entire grant application in the foyer of the council offices because they had \u201cclosed for staff training\u201d and she had bet the day on time. He laughed, pleased to find grit under her polish and polish under her grit.\n\nThey broke early so she could go to the community centre site on the edge of town. The mayor had insisted on two ribbons because the local florist owed her a favour and had gone wild with satin. Priya had prepped the speeches to within an inch of their lives and then folded them into her bag with the confident nihilism of someone who knew the words were for the council\u2019s website and the real ceremony was the first scuff on the new floor. Mark arrived with his mother and a scarf that had been knitted by someone with a vendetta against subtlety. The youth orchestra arrayed themselves with the solemnity of children who have been told they are participating in civic life. The tuba gleamed like a planet. The trombone did not sound sick anymore. A girl with hair that refused to sit stood with a flute that had clearly been loved back to functionality, and when she put it to her lip Rowena felt the sound go through her where blood should.\n\nThe mayor, a woman with a laugh like a taxi door slamming, pretended to slice the ribbon while Rowena held it and did not get misty-eyed, and then cut for real with scissors that had once been destined for cardboard. \u201cYou\u2019re meant to speak,\u201d Priya hissed, and Rowena did, keeping it to the length of a bus stop shelter. She thanked the builders and the boys who had lugged chairs and the mums who had tolerated late paint. She thanked that feeling in town that was not pride or pity but the middle bit that holds everything up. She did not say Lydia\u2019s name, though she felt it the way you feel a bead in your shoe.\n\nAfterwards, someone put on music because people always put on music, and there was a not-quite-dance on the new floor, the kind that happens when strangers think they might as well let their bodies do unambitious good. Mark\u2019s mother pulled Rowena into a spin that defied health and safety and told her she was too thin or too something and to eat, for god\u2019s sake. Priya caught her eye over paper cups of fizzy drink and gave her a look that translated easily: You are allowed to enjoy this. Please do.\n\nLydia sent a message that night, the tone arranged to appear casual. Saw you at the centre via someone\u2019s Facebook Live. Nice. Remember the St. Anne\u2019s hall? You fell on a scuff and we blamed the caretaker\u2019s polish. x Rowena looked at the small x as if it were a knot in wood. She typed and erased and typed and erased again, then settled on: I remember. The floor is good today. See you at Dome. No kiss. She put the phone face down and dug a spoon into yoghurt like it owed her money.\n\nThe Brighton Dome had the kind of air that forces you to stand up straighter just because you have ancestors. The stage, even without light, pulled on the strings of every old dream of velvet curtains and applause like weather. Andy greeted her with three hangers and an expression that meant he had wrestled with dragons and drag queens and triumphed. \u201cBlue,\u201d he announced, delivering on his promise. \u201cWith a sleeve that thinks it\u2019s coy, and buttons doing the Lord\u2019s work down the back. We\u2019ll thread a ribbon here. If you hate the ribbon, I will personally kick it into the Channel.\u201d\n\nShe did not hate the ribbon. She did not like that the mirrors backstage were honest in a way that could make a saint reconsider. Andy softened the light with a cloth like a magician doing childcare. \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone tell you different,\u201d he murmured as he fussed with the hem. \u201cIf the costume makes sorry for you, burn it. If it makes space for you, wear it.\u201d\n\nThey walked the steps in chalk marks, numbers pressed into the floor where other feet had reasoned before. The band was half there, the trombonist warming, the drummer fidgeting with brushes, the conductor tapping a pencil against his teeth and flirting with the air. Jonah took her to the edge of the stage and had her look out at seats that would soon be filled with lungs and judgement and joy. \u201cThis is yours,\u201d he said softly. \u201cNot possessed. Belonged to for a night.\u201d\n\nHe told her, in a loosening way he had not done before, about the first time he stood on a stage smaller than this in Manchester, with a company that kept its costumes in a closet that used to be a shower. He told her about a night when he exited stage left and met a woman crying by the fire door because she wanted her life to be about something and wasn\u2019t sure it was. He sat with her on the sticky floor until she did not cry anymore and then went back on because that\u2019s what bodies with promises do. He told her about his grandmother who did not say she was proud but who ironed his shirts with a ferocity that communicated the same. She told him, in return, how she had once convinced a business owner who had never danced except drunk to give them money enough for a music teacher by comparing children\u2019s fingers on strings to the first time he started an engine that wasn\u2019t his. \u201cHe said yes because men love engines,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd because he was lonely.\u201d\n\nThey tried the first eight bars with the band and it went wrong in the delightful way that makes musicians alert and dancers defensive. The drummer added a breath they hadn\u2019t accounted for. The strings were brighter than the demo. Jonah adjusted without making it an announcement. \u201cWe\u2019ll build you an inhale here,\u201d he said, and the conductor nodded as if he had just been invited to share dessert. Rowena found the new small pause and placed her foot in it like a truth.\n\nHer ankle muttered later, a sullen throbbing that made stairs more interesting than they were designed to be. Jean found the old tub of Epsom salts and the even older towel that had dried every hurt in the house. \u201cSit,\u201d her mother ordered, and sat too because caring was a verb that doubled. \u201cTell me the worst idea you\u2019ve had today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought about saying to the cameras that I don\u2019t mind if I lose,\u201d Rowena said, amused and alarmed by her own bravado. \u201cWhich is the kind of sentence only a liar would say on the day before.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell them you mind,\u201d Jean said. \u201cBut don\u2019t let them make your minding the story. Win or lose are small words compared to dance and give.\u201d\n\nKiki left a voice note that sounded like a friend trying not to be a producer. \u201cWe\u2019re doing sit-downs in the morning. It\u2019ll be five minutes. I\u2019m not going to ask you about your childhood unless you volunteer it, scout\u2019s honour. I do want you to tell me, on record, what you want this to do for Crawley. And yes, I know you hate being made into a saint. I promise I\u2019m allergic to halos.\u201d\n\nIn the morning they put her in a chair in a side room strung with fairy lights because someone had a budget for kindness. Simon crouched the way he always did. Kiki asked questions that had teeth but wore lipstick. Rowena said that half the point was the Trust and the dust and the quiet ways money can make a chair a dignity instead of a surface. She said the other half was selfish and radiant, that a woman gets to become new things after forty without needing permission slips. She watched herself in the unseen lens and felt surprisingly like herself.\n\nShe saw Lydia in the corridor afterwards, in a robe that made her look like a weather system. They traded the sort of conversation people have when there are microphones within reach and history without an address. Lydia\u2019s smile was wider than warm. \u201cBreak a leg,\u201d she said, the universal benediction delivered with a fizz she could not parse. Rowena smiled back with all the teeth she owned and said, \u201cNever,\u201d because her legs had spent the night in salt.\n\nBack at the studio, there was too much energy and not enough air. The DJ from Worthing was practicing a samba like a skipping rope. The actor from the hospital show had a face that had argued with tabloids and won by ignoring them. The footballer\u2019s wife from Hove had the focus of someone who had survived stadiums. Jonah wrapped Rowena into frame to remind her that names were merely labels on jars and it was the contents that made supper. They ran the middle section where she always forgot to breathe and suddenly she did not forget and the music walked with her. He did not say good. He said again, which was better.\n\nThe night stole in as if embarrassed to be seen. She went with Priya to the bandstand to watch teenagers attempt to film a music video with a phone on a stack of textbooks. Priya, who had once abhorred paper cuts and now wore them like credentials, slipped an arm through hers. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to become a person who talks about how it\u2019s not about them while their face is on a six-foot poster outside the Tesco,\u201d she said lightly, and Rowena laughed because she had already composed that speech in her head and burnt it. \u201cGood,\u201d Priya said. \u201cBecause I have a speech ready in case you do and it involves the phrase \u2018get over yourself\u2019 tattooed on the wind.\u201d\n\nThey bought chips and ate them standing, wind doing its therapy. A man who had been young when the Beatles were, and was now merely himself, asked what time the show would be on. \u201cMy granddaughter wants to vote but she\u2019s abroad and I told her that\u2019s cheating,\u201d he confided. \u201cI\u2019ll clap extra for her.\u201d Rowena thanked him with a seriousness that felt appropriate to chips in the cold. She walked home with salt on her fingers and a calm that pooled. In the kitchen she put on the radio and found a waltz where she did not expect one, a late-night DJ with a heart that wanted to make strangers soft. She let her shoulder remember the rule Jonah had given it: speak in long sentences. Her reflection in the window was tilted by all the small lights of town and she did not try to correct it.\n\nThe last day before the final arrived with the kind of sunlight British people applaud as if it had paid for the privilege. Andy adjusted the sleeve and told her she looked like a woman who could ask for what she wanted and get it. Jonah arrived with a book of crossword puzzles to calm his hands. Kiki delivered an agenda that was part festival, part invasion. There would be photographers. There would be small microphones that could betray you if you swallowed. There would be folk singing backstage or something like it because musicians get bored and cure themselves. There would be, above all, waiting.\n\nThey had a stumble-through that was wonderful in the way that musicals of the eighties had taught her the word meant: everything goes wrong where you can fix it. She did not fix one thing because Jonah told her not to, and then his eyes told her to trust it, and she did. She saw Lydia run a sequence from backstage, a ribbon of speed and glitter, and she let it live in the corner of her eye without feeding it. She visited the band as if they were holy, thanking them for the way they carried weight with a bow. The conductor asked if she would mind if the strings leaned a .5 hair more into the joke on bar twenty-three because it made him feel like life had meaning, and she told him to lean as if he were trying to eavesdrop on his own joy.\n\nJean arrived with a bag that looked like it might contain a roast chicken and in fact had safety pins, plasters, fruit pastilles, and a card with a saint on it despite not believing in saints. \u201cI found this in a charity shop when you were twelve,\u201d she said, handing over the card with a shrug as if she were offering a kitchen timer. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if it was your saint but the woman on the front has hair that refuses instruction, so it felt right. Stick it in your bag and find it again when you\u2019re eighty.\u201d\n\nThey sat in the corner of a backstage lounge with carpets that had seen secrets. \u201cTell me what you\u2019ll do if you forget what comes next,\u201d Jean said, like an oral exam that had nothing to do with terror.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll walk,\u201d Rowena said, surprising herself with the clarity of it. \u201cI\u2019ll walk in time until my bones tell me they\u2019re ready again. I\u2019ll look over his shoulder as if there\u2019s a door I meant to find.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Jean said. \u201cAnd if you aren\u2019t fine, you\u2019ll be interesting, which is better.\u201d She put her old hand over Rowena\u2019s, brown with age and a life of disinfectant and flour. \u201cI wish your father were here to see you,\u201d she added, and it was not a sad sentence. It was a sentence like a weather report: true, and carrying no demands.\n\nIn the hour before curtain they sewed her into the dress with friendly precision. Andy\u2019s assistant, a rangy young person with eyeliner like intention, told her she had the posture of an honest person and she almost cried at the stupidity of how that kind of comment can go straight into your marrow. Jonah came to find her when it was time to put shoes on. He did not make speeches. He just tied his own laces with a concentration that made her want to pat his head like a child. \u201cOne favour,\u201d he said, after the laces were tied. \u201cIf at any point you feel your mind run ahead of your feet, think of the bench by the lake and put your heel down like you\u2019re claiming it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf at any point I don\u2019t,\u201d she replied, \u201cremind me to breathe in threes.\u201d\n\nThe corridor to the wings smelled of lacquer and ambition. The actor from the hospital show did a silly handshake with his partner and then did it again, because ritual requires repetition. The footballer\u2019s wife kissed a small charm on her wrist. The DJ from Worthing took a photo of everyone\u2019s shoes lined up like they were at school and promised to send it to them later, which she did immediately. Lydia, already luminous, stood with her hands on her hips and rolled her neck like a cat before a fight that was not a fight. She caught Rowena\u2019s eye and for a brief second there was neither past nor future, only two women about to do something that would make them visible. \u201cSee you on the other side,\u201d Lydia said, and this time it landed in the dignified place.\n\nWhen the lights came up on the first number and the audience made the kind of noise that has a roof to it, Rowena felt something unclasp under her ribs. It was not fear. It was the idea that she had to be either giver or receiver and could not be both. It blessed her and left. She stood in the wing and counted quietly to herself until it lined up with the band\u2019s intent, until her foot and the drummer\u2019s brush were cousins. The stage manager, a woman with headphones like jewellery, squeezed her arm at the right moment and sent her into the dark the way you send a small boat into a lake you have loved since you were young and stupid and brave.\n\nThey took their places as the strings took their breath, and when the first bar came it was like stepping into a kitchen you did not know you owned but had always kept the key to in your pocket. Jonah\u2019s palm at her back was not instruction; it was translation. The turn that had scandalised her body for days lived and breathed as if it were a creature that had wandered out of the woods and consented to be seen. She looked over his shoulder as if there were a door and found not only the door but the corridor and the air beyond it. The smirk in the waltz did its work and somewhere, not far, she heard someone make a noise they did not know they would make. She did not forget. When she felt herself consider forgetting, she placed her heel as if a bench were at stake and the bench complied.\n\nThe middle section where the room had always tilted decided to behave under lights because sometimes pressure is a kind of discipline that liberates. The judges\u2019 table blurred into glow. The edges of the stage spoke to her feet and told them where not to go. At the small pause they had built with the band, Jonah\u2019s eyes asked her a question she understood and answered with her shoulder. The ribbon on her dress remembered its purpose and did not rebel. The floor did not present a scuff in the name of narrative symmetry because life does not always deliver metaphors that easily. She made three turns in a row that felt like sentences with commas and no full stops, which was exactly how she wanted her day to be read.\n\nThey ended, as one must, with a bow that was a conversation with an audience she would never meet in kitchens and shops but would meet in the way they carried her afterward in their talk. The applause was not charity. She knew charity applause. She had organised charity applause. This was a sound like rain finally remembering. She took it into her bones and into the places where youth and age meet and decide to share a sandwich. They left the stage backwards because that is how you keep time in the modern world, and in the wing she let the air enter her lungs like she had just been allowed to land.\n\nShe did not cry, not yet. That came later, when Simon with his bent scar came to take a photo and she saw in his lens not a woman being brave but a woman being exactly the size of herself. Jonah said something unflashy and perfect, and Priya barreled into her like a cousin and said too many words in the right order, and Jean, when she arrived at her shoulder somehow through rules she had not been told about, kissed her cheek and said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t fall,\u201d as if that were the least of it and also the headline.\n\nThere were scores, of course. Numbers delivered with wit and a minor insult wrapped in velvet. The panel did their thing: one pirouette of praise, one comment about arms that in another life would have made her small but now just made her want to feed them. Somewhere in there Lydia danced in a way that made time respect itself, and Rowena watched and applauded hard because good is good and envy is a petty thief that steals your socks and leaves you barefoot rather than barefoot and dancing. The DJ woman did her samba and looked like a canary released. The actor charmed the lights and the lights consented to be charmed. The footballer\u2019s wife demonstrated that focus is a kind of philanthropy.\n\nBackstage, Lydia found her again, and this time there was sweat and relief on both faces. \u201cYou were\u2014\u201d Lydia began, searching for a word that did not come with glitter. \u201cYou were yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo were you,\u201d Rowena said, and neither of them knew whether they were complimenting or admitting. It did not matter. It was a sentence that had waited thirty years to be said in that exact tone.\n\nKiki, incandescent with triumph and exhaustion, hugged her in a way that made their microphones threaten to kiss. \u201cWe got it,\u201d she said into her hair. \u201cWe got you, the real you. And Crawley looked like a postcard I want to send to my own mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cSend her the one with the terrier,\u201d Rowena said. \u201cHe is the soul of our town. Also the bit where the boy with the skateboard asked me if I was famous yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlready in the cut,\u201d Kiki promised. \u201cHe says \u2018yet\u2019 like a prayer.\u201d She squeezed Rowena\u2019s hand hard and then let go because letting go is part of the job.\n\nThe rest of the night did what nights do when they have been kindly used. It allowed for eatings. It made room for calls from people who had watched with children on their knees and dogs on their feet. It delivered a text from Mark that was all caps and punctuation crimes and better for it. It let the youth orchestra send a photo of their instruments leaning against chairs like tired wedding guests. It let Priya make a joke about the mayor having survived the spray tan in the audience and therefore deserving an MBE for services to the colour orange. It allowed Jean to fall asleep on the sofa with her glasses still on and wake exactly when Rowena needed her to.\n\nRowena walked home long instead of short because nerves leave a residue the body must wash away in motion. The town had changed because light had changed but was fundamentally itself, doing the small serious work of being home for people who hate and love it in equal measure. She stopped by the lake even though the dark had recruited the water for its army. A fox crossed her path and did not apologise. Above, the sky made no comment. She stood there long enough to become hungry, which is how you know you are alive and not a statue gussied up with sequins.\n\nOn her doorstep she found an envelope the colour of butter, the handwriting a slant she recognised from detentions. Inside: a postcard of St. Anne\u2019s hall, cheap and terrible, with a note that said, Okay. You win this one. L. It was not gracious. It was as graceful as Lydia could manage with all her mirrors. Rowena laughed, then, alone and good, the sound blurry and bright in the night. She went inside and wrote Lydia a reply on the back of a flyer for the open day because paper is paper. It said: It wasn\u2019t a fight. But thank you for stepping where you stepped. R.\n\nIn the morning she slept later than any respectable adult should and allowed herself to be late for everything on purpose. The town, contrite or amused, returned to its normal schedule. The buses were late. The postie came when he felt like it. The gulls adhered to no known timetable. She went to the office and the door stuck and she blessed it and made tea in a paper cup and sat at her desk while Priya told her three things in quick succession: that the dentist had called and it might actually be urgent, that the youth orchestra had been offered a spot at the summer fair, and that Channel Five wanted to do a follow-up where they get her to teach the mayor a box step in the bandstand.\n\n\u201cTell them I will only teach the mayor a box step if she agrees to hold her phone as if it is a small animal,\u201d Rowena said. \u201cAnd make the dentist book me in for Wednesday. My teeth exist. They can be examined. I have been examined enough. Let them join the queue.\u201d She looked at the pile of paperwork that had quietly birthed a second pile and felt no despair, only the performance hum that had not left her yet. It had changed flavour. It tasted now like readiness rather than risk.\n\nAt lunch, a girl came in with a form that needed a signature and bravado that needed not to be punctured. She had the shoulders of someone told regularly she took up too much space. Rowena signed the form and then, before the girl could leave, asked if she had somewhere to be at four on Thursdays. The girl blinked. \u201cThere\u2019s a dance thing at the centre,\u201d Rowena said lightly. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly chaos disguised as rhythm. You\u2019d be welcome. Bring shoes that don\u2019t apologise.\u201d\n\nThe girl nodded once, the minimal movement that signals a life changing direction. She left, and the bakery below chose that moment to take something out of an oven and bully the entire building. Priya groaned and went to buy survival pastries. Jonah texted a photograph of the sea with a caption that said, My grandmother says well done. She never says that. I am passing it on before it evaporates. Rowena wrote back a photograph of Crawley\u2019s least photogenic roundabout and a caption that said, My mother says I didn\u2019t fall. She always says that. I am passing it on like a family joke.\n\nShe had thought the day after would be a plummet. It was not. It was a step into another beat. Not faster, not slower, just exactly measured with the town\u2019s heart. She filed and phoned and received photos from people who had watched in rooms she knew and in rooms she would never see. She ate a custard slice without dignity. She told Priya she was going to be unreasonable about the LED lights in the car park until the council gave in. She thought of a boy\u2019s elbow in a suit jacket too big for him at a graduation and felt the future knock at the door, polite as anything, persistent as damp.\n\nThat evening, when the sky had the pale look of a kettle again, she took her shoes off like a ceremony and put the blue dress in a garment bag like a story that would be told again only when it made sense. She stood in the middle of her mother\u2019s kitchen in bare feet and danced the bit they had not rehearsed because there is always a bit you don\u2019t rehearse. It was the part where you let the music speak through you without auditioning it first. It was small and entirely ridiculous and suited her very well. Jean watched from the doorway and said nothing and then said everything in the way she put the kettle on without asking. The water boiled like a good joke remembered. They drank their tea. They were not ordinary. They were two women in a house, making a day behave. Outside, Crawley did what it always did, which was try. Inside, Rowena let her bones count to three and then four and then three again, because she had earned the right to change time and live to tell of it.Chapter Five\n\nThe week after the Dome, Crawley went back to being itself with a sigh that sounded like buses arriving when you have already walked to the next stop. The posters outside the Tesco survived two days of rain before they curled like leaves, and someone drew a crown on Rowena\u2019s hair in biro which made Priya laugh and made Rowena feel oddly knighted by a child\u2019s boredom. People stopped her and said things like, you looked taller on the telly, love, and didn\u2019t you do well, and my granddaughter says your dress wanted to go to church. She thanked them and meant it, because there are worse fates than being folded into people\u2019s stories in small and friendly ways. She learned that fame in Crawley is a handshake, not a spotlight, and that hurrying never improves a conversation carried out between a bakery and a bus shelter.\n\nShe went to the dentist on Wednesday like a penitent who had promised a saint something foolish. The waiting room had six plants trying their best and a poster about gums that made her want to brush until she had no teeth left. The hygienist offered a smile that had been whitened to the point of theology and told her that she was clenching at night, which sounded like something a person did in a poem, but apparently it cracked enamel and made jawbones sulk. The dentist, a man with forearms that said tennis but eyes that said sudoku, showed her tiny fracture lines in a molar as if they were lines on a palm. \u201cIt\u2019s the body\u2019s way of writing,\u201d he said, surprisingly gentle. \u201cYou\u2019ve been biting your life. Try biting fewer moons for a bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m allergic to moons,\u201d she replied, because cheek had always gotten her through medical conversations, and he laughed and put a slick of something protective in a place nobody would admire. He told her to wear a guard at night. She thought of armour and the delicate indecencies of sleep, and she thought of how she had been clenching since she could remember and how now, perhaps, she could tell her jaw that it could rest because her feet had found other uses for tension. Outside, a collection of schoolchildren were attempting to decide whether the rain was an obstacle or a dare. She stood under the awning and made a small pact with herself to treat her molars like colleagues rather than serfs.\n\nOn Thursday she unlocked the community centre early and stood for a minute in the doorway breathing the smell of varnish and possibility, and then fussed with chairs until fussing had done all it could. The first of the Thursday lot arrived in a trickle: a girl with a bun that refused containment and two boys pretending their trainers were exhausted by fate, a grandmother in a cardigan with a zip and a young mother in boots that had seen a field. Rowena put music on with the casual authority of someone who knows the right kind of volume is half the battle. \u201cIt\u2019s chaos disguised as rhythm,\u201d she told a newcomer who looked wary, and then proved it by setting them to a line of simple steps that became miraculously complicated when hope entered the room.\n\nShe did not talk about the Dome because the room did not need the Dome. She talked about weight and breath and how your body tells the person you\u2019re with how much you trust them by not apologising for physics. When they practised a turn that preferred to be shy, the grandmother muttered that hips had never been honest in her family, and everyone laughed and the turn became easier. Midway through, the doors opened again and Jonah came in holding a bag of resistance bands and a jar of jam that had obviously been given to him on the street by someone over seventy. He slid along the wall with a grin, trying not to be the sun.\n\n\u201cI brought contraband,\u201d he whispered in a voice that was audible to the end of the line, and the boys\u2019 eyebrows went up a fraction in solidarity with anything labelled contraband. He didn\u2019t teach; he assisted. He stood beside the girl with the refusnik bun and made his hand a metronome until her foot trusted the floor. He demonstrated frame with a broom in a way that made the grandmother say, \u201cOh,\u201d as if she had just remembered an old joke. When the young mother confessed she worried her arms looked silly, he told her that arms do not get to be silly when they\u2019ve carried two shopping bags, a child and an argument.\n\nAfter, they sat on the edge of the stage with paper cups of squash, feet hanging like punctuation. Jonah told them about how balance is something you discover in motion and how standing still can be the trickiest step. \u201cYou all look like you\u2019ve got good ankles,\u201d he added, making everyone feel secretly flattered by a body part. Rowena watched him watching people and felt a small thread tug in her. It wasn\u2019t romantic in the way a film would have made it \u2014 no slow zoom, no clarinet \u2014 it was quieter and more stubborn, the feeling of having found a person who would stand beside you in a draught without speaking until you were both ready to.\n\nShe walked out into drizzle with him later, both of them carrying bags, both pretending to ignore the way the weather had decided to become personality. They didn\u2019t talk about what the future did or didn\u2019t hold because neither of them liked to hire the future before it did an interview. He said his grandmother had indeed said \u201cwell done\u201d and had then ruined the purity of it by ironing as if she could improve the compliment with steam. She told him Jean had not washed her hair all weekend in case the success lived in there like a benign parasite. They parted at the corner with a plan so modest it felt invincible: he would come to Crawley for fish and chips and then they would attempt to waltz in a pub garden to jukebox music while pretending to argue about bus routes.\n\nKiki brought her clipboard and a film crew to the bandstand two days later and tried not to look as if she were about to herd cats through velvet rope. The mayor arrived in a coat with buttons advocating for at least six causes and held her phone in both hands like a small mammal awaiting a vet. \u201cI promised I\u2019d hold it like a hedgehog,\u201d she declared, with relish, when Rowena reminded her of the conditions. They attempted a box step to something that wasn\u2019t quite a box step song, which made it better. The mayor loved it when she got the corner right and loved it more when she didn\u2019t and the corner forgave her. Two teenage boys attempted to walk in a straight line past the cameras without contracting any visible joy and failed at the second part. A woman with a pram shouted that she\u2019d seen worse on Strictly and the mayor shouted back that she took that as a compliment.\n\nThey were halfway through when the text arrived about the new centre. Priya\u2019s message was brief and spiky: Paint on east wall. Don\u2019t look until you\u2019ve had tea. Bring kindness. Also bring a cloth. Rowena went anyway and skipped the tea, because curiosity has a louder voice than wisdom when you\u2019ve helped build a wall that is now wearing someone else\u2019s mouth. The words were in spray paint the colour of arrogance, but the hand that had made them wasn\u2019t skilled enough to make cruelty look elegant. It said: PAY TO PLAY, which was both wrong and dull. Beneath, a crude caricature of a woman with a tiara that had more spikes than sense.\n\nTwo lads in school blazers were loitering at a distance with the forced nonchalance of people who have been told to observe but not demonstrate interest. A girl with a backpack was drawing on her thumb with a biro to avoid looking at Rowena. She stood and looked and did nothing for a few breaths because reactions are stories you tell in a hurry that you have to live with. Then she called Priya and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll need paint, the cheap kind, and rollers for small hands. And you know that boy with the chalk art? Bribe him with cake to come and draw like a priest.\u201d Priya said she already had the cake and the boy and a trolley that could take a wall on a date.\n\nThey made an afternoon of it because what else do you do with assaults that are more about being seen than about damage. Mark turned up with a cohort who had only come for the free biscuits and stayed because someone put drum and bass on very quietly and the job suddenly had rhythm. The boy with the chalk art came with a box of colours that had seen worse pavements and drew a river that refused to stay inside any lines anyone had given it. The girl with the backpack watched for a while and then took a brush with the solemnity of a knight handed a sword and painted a bird whose wings did not match and therefore felt true.\n\nWhen the lads in blazers slouched close enough for apologies, Rowena smiled the kind of smile that rescues people from edges and said, \u201cHelp me replace the tiara with a hat that doesn\u2019t shame the head wearing it.\u201d They laughed, relieved, and painted a beanie that made the caricature look like a neighbour who borrows sugar and returns it as cake. A police community support officer wandered by and wisely decided this required no paperwork, only a compliment. Simon arrived without Kiki or a camera because sometimes friends arrive when there is colour, and he fetched tea in cups that burned fingers and stood on a chair to paint a part none of them could reach. Priya kept receipts and pride in equal measure and liked the way the afternoon had decided to be necessary. When they were done, the wall had become a conversation people would want to join, not the last word of a fool\u2019s sentence. Rowena sent a photo to Kiki with a caption that said, we pay with time, we play for keeps.\n\nThat night, while she was soaking the paint out of her knuckles, Lydia sent a message that contained more heart than words. Saw the mural. Good answer. I\u2019m in town Tuesday for radio. Coffee? Station bar, no cameras, I swear on my worst rehearsal skirt. Rowena stared at the request until it lost its power to rearrange her organs and then replied with an hour and a yes and an emoji she did not understand why she had chosen, a small flag she could pretend meant something neutral.\n\nThey met in the kind of cafe that tried to be a bar by keeping the lights down and playing a playlist that assumed people drank red wine at noon. Lydia wore a coat that had opinions and a face that had learned to hold two ideas at once: self-belief and please don\u2019t hurt me. They hugged in the awkward way of women who have practised impressive indifference for so long that their arms have forgotten. They sat. They ordered tea because tea is a truce. The barista had a haircut that required faith in the future and a smile that made tipping inevitable.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come to tell you I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Lydia said first, because she had always preferred to be the person who begins. \u201cThat sounds like theatre, and I think you\u2019re allergic to theatre unless it\u2019s got children and a broken chair in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not allergic,\u201d Rowena said, and then laughed, unspooling a little. \u201cI break out in a rash and I come out in hives and then I bring plasters. Don\u2019t let me take the metaphor somewhere it doesn\u2019t want to go. Go on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came to say I remember being fourteen and cruel, and I have spent years being congratulated for being relentless, and I haven\u2019t decided yet whether those two things are cousins,\u201d Lydia said. \u201cI came to say that when you danced at the Dome I remembered that you existed separate from me. I didn\u2019t know that at fourteen. Nobody tells girls that other girls are not mirrors.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t very\u2026forgiving,\u201d Rowena said, and it felt like placing a coin down on a counter and seeing if it would roll. \u201cI used your face like a fence I could lean on and not fall, and then I resented the fence for existing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour bus got there before mine,\u201d Lydia said, with a wryness that suggested she had rehearsed this line and, finding it useful, kept it. \u201cMy mother\u2019s voice was in my chest so loud I couldn\u2019t hear my own. She has opinions about women who stop and put kettles on. Mine is that kettles are holy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does she make of the final?\u201d Rowena asked, and they both smiled at the safety of a question with an answer that wouldn\u2019t scalp them.\n\n\u201cShe has opinions,\u201d Lydia said again, but softer this time. \u201cShe thinks I should have worn red. She thinks I should have been given a longer bit of camera in my exit. She thinks I should marry someone who can clap in time. She thinks you were \u2018surprising,\u2019 which is her way of complimenting someone she\u2019s already tried to pigeonhole.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could tell her I have an excellent dentist,\u201d Rowena said, and Lydia choked on tea, then lived. They allowed themselves to laugh in that small bar with its earnest lighting and its baked goods that glistened like sin. It wasn\u2019t a reconciliation because there had been no declared war, no ink, no treaties to draft. It was a rearrangement of furniture in a room they had both avoided. They left it better.\n\nAt the door, Lydia paused as if deciding whether to walk back in and change the ending. \u201cIf they ask me to do a Christmas special,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m going to say no. I thought you\u2019d like to know I have learned the word no and I plan to put it where it belongs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can borrow my box of noes,\u201d Rowena replied. \u201cIt\u2019s full. I make more every week. They go well with jam.\u201d They hugged again and it landed, less armour, more bone. Outside, the trains argued with their timetables and people pretended time was solid. Lydia walked towards an appointment with her own voice. Rowena walked towards the trust office and the smell of cinnamon and paperwork.\n\nThe youth orchestra\u2019s first outing as a proper ensemble with brass that didn\u2019t sulk was at the summer fair in a park that insisted on calling itself a field despite being overshadowed by a row of semi-detacheds. A Ferris wheel had been borrowed from somewhere whose name suggested coastal glamour and now squeaked indignantly at a sky that refused to stay blue. The tuba made jokes with its shadow. The trombone refrained from sounding like ill wildlife and instead sounded like a thing agreeing. A boy who had never been allowed to be loud before was asked by the conductor to be very loud indeed at bar twelve, and his face at bar twelve was the kind of face a person tries to write poems about and shouldn\u2019t because you cannot net that fish; you only clap and remember the water.\n\nRowena wore a dress without a cause and shoes that did not scream to be noticed, and she took a paper programme that had been printed at a cost she had negotiated with a man who claimed ink had tripled in price since the Romans. She stood at the side while parents swayed and grandparents became only ears. Jonah found her halfway through a brass arrangement of something that had been born in a disco and smiled in the way that says later, let\u2019s be pleased about this. He held two volcanic polystyrene cups of tea like a juggler and asked her if she wanted a doughnut or an alibi. She took the doughnut because sugar wins fewer wars but fights better.\n\nAfter the fair they followed the river into a pub garden and attempted the plan they had set because there is a dignity to keeping promises even when they seem daft. The jukebox produced a waltz-like thing by accident, and they counted quietly in each other\u2019s proximity while men in shorts did their best not to make eye contact. An elderly couple gazed with the neutral curiosity of people who have seen much and survived most of it. They danced a couple of passes and then stopped because there was nothing to prove and the grass had decided to be ambitious. They sat. He told her about a company he\u2019d been offered work with that would take him away on and off, the kind of proposition that theatre makes like a magician producing a rabbit and then asking for your signature in blood. She told him about a council meeting on lighting where she intended to turn a car park into a ballroom in order to embarrass the budget. They looked at each other not to solve anything but to file new information under the drawer labelled, \u201cTell me when you\u2019re ready to put this somewhere permanent.\u201d\n\nThe first unpleasantness arrived on a Monday the colour of old paperwork and soup. A local paper printed an editorial with the kind of headline that tells you the subeditor learned irony as a second language: \u201cGlitz or Graft? Has the Leigh Trust Lost Its Way?\u201d It was the usual stew of suspicion and budget line misreadings, with an insinuation that she had danced while benches went unbuilt and a cheap shot about cameras that made her jaw test the guard\u2019s usefulness. Priya walked in with three copies because she believed in studying your enemies in hard copy, not on a screen, and told Rowena she was permitted three ways of responding: ignored, politely savage, or danced on. \u201cDancing on it requires a stage and a sequinned shrug,\u201d Priya said, dry. \u201cPolitely savage can be framed and hung over my desk. Ignoring it requires faith.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s starve it,\u201d Rowena said, after the kind of pause that other people might mistake for indecision and Priya knew was caution. \u201cAnd let\u2019s feed the thing it tried to eat. I\u2019m still doing the night walk. I\u2019m still turning the car park into a ballroom. I\u2019m still going to steal the floodlights by calling them safety not spectacle.\u201d\n\nThey printed flyers for the night walk on paper that had ideas above its station and knocked on doors that never opened the first time. They invited the choir from St. Mark\u2019s on the understanding that 7/8 time could go home if it wanted to. They asked Simon to bring a camera only if he left his permission slips in the car. They negotiated with the supermarket whose car park it was as if they were asking to borrow a kitten. The supermarket said yes because they liked the idea of warm goodwill and because someone in the office had watched the show and had a mother who adored Jean\u2019s cardigan.\n\nThe night was colder than necessary, which pleased everyone because then the tea tasted like an outcome. They strung solar fairy lights along the shortest route to the darkest corner and named the corners after people who had refused to be intimidated by bulbs. The violinist came with the terrier and played a reel and then a hymn and then that almost waltz he always played, and people took strides as if strides could be good deeds. The mayor arrived in trainers and held her phone like a hedgehog who had decided the vet was decent. A group of teenagers pretended not to care until the drums of the youth orchestra joined and then they cared very loudly and tried to disguise caring as running, which made everyone happy.\n\nRowena climbed onto a low wall because not all speeches require a mic if you have shoulders that have learned to speak. She said that light is not decoration in a town where children go home from clubs at dusk and nurses walk to work at five. She said that money spent on illumination is money that refuses to be noble and chooses, deliberately, to be useful. She did not mention the newspaper by name because dignity is a harder hobby but worth keeping. She asked people to walk with her in a lap of the car park as if it were a lake and the swans had agreed to be honest for one night. They walked. They applauded lampposts. They applauded each other. The supermarket manager stood near the trolleys and looked like a man who would sign a thing in the morning without asking for three meetings first.\n\nHer phone vibrated with messages from donors and grumps and that rare beast, the donor-grump, while she carried a tray of biscuits like a waitress from a dream. Priya handed her a stack of pledge forms and said, \u201cOne step at a time,\u201d and then took away the stack because she trusted Rowena more when her hands were free. Simon didn\u2019t film the faces of children because he kept his promises, but he did film the way light seats itself on concrete like purpose, and he sent her a short clip later with a caption that said, \u201cYour town looks like it likes itself for once.\u201d\n\nThe day after, council officers wrote in emails with the kind of briskness that pretends to be disapproval and is actually a concession. They found the money in a pocket they\u2019d forgotten and the lights became line items with dates attached. Priya put the dates in a calendar in ink instead of pencil for the first time in months and treated herself to a pastry so complicated it had to be named after a country. Rowena wrote a letter to the paper that wasn\u2019t savage at all; it was patient. She explained how budgets are buckets that are happiest when you hold them steady with both hands. She did not justify. She did not apologise. She thanked the editor for loving the town loudly enough to ask questions in public and invited him to come to the Thursday class to see what public money looks like when it stops being paper and starts being breath.\n\nJonah sent her a message in the middle of the afternoon with a photograph of a studio floor and the scuff marks arranged like constellations. His caption said, \u201cThought you\u2019d like this map.\u201d She wrote back a photograph of the newly painted wall at the centre and the beanie that had replaced the tiara. Her caption said, \u201cWe found north.\u201d He wrote back a joke about compasses. She didn\u2019t reply because she was in a meeting with a man who said synergy four times and meant nothing by it, but later she went to the park and tried walking in time to the traffic and found it possible.\n\nJean had a fall that was small in physics and large in implication. It was a misjudged step in the garden on a day when the grass pretended not to be wet, a slip that ended with a fold rather than a crash, a bruise the colour of eggplant that spread its way into conversation. She didn\u2019t tell Rowena until two days after because her pride has always been a useful liar, and when she did she presented it like an anecdote she had edited for laughs. \u201cI told the hydrangea not to overreact,\u201d she said, dry as a council biscuit, and Rowena kissed the top of her head and counted backwards while checking ankles. They went to see the doctor together and the doctor said the things doctors say about vitamin D and sensible shoes and not pretending the body was made by a company with a lifetime guarantee. Jean sulked and then conceded and then let Rowena put her hair into a plait that made her look more dangerous than fragile.\n\nIt rained three days in a row in a way that felt like discipline. The centre roof held. The youth orchestra practised a piece that contained mischief and sadness and made parents look around as if for tissues and rationalizations. A girl came to the Thursday class who had been told by a PE teacher that her body was for thinking, not doing, and Rowena put a hand just above her elbow and showed her where weight is just an idea. The girl left with a new problem to consider and a schedule that now had Thursdays in it in ink.\n\nA week later, Jonah asked if she would come to Brighton not for a rehearsal or a television anything but for a ceilidh in a room above a pub where the floorboards had learned humility. She said yes because she had said no to a lot of things this year and had discovered that yes could be a garment that didn\u2019t ride up. The band had a caller with a voice like a recipe and arms like a conductor who had been demoted and took it well. They stamped and circled and swung, and it was not elegant but it was holy in that evidence-of-life way. Rowena laughed so hard at one point that a man in a kilt turned to see what he\u2019d done and felt gratified. They went outside to breathe and watched the sea insist on its own clich\u00e9s and then surprise them with a wave so gentle it felt staged. They did not kiss because not kissing can be an event of its own, and because both of them wanted to be adults about desire. They promised dinner where the cutlery would have arguments with the napkins and then went home to their separate beds with hearts that were not empty.\n\nOn a Sunday morning afterwards she met Lydia again, unplanned, in the aisle with the tinned tomatoes. They had both come without armour, hair pretending it had behaved itself. They compared brands as if they were talking about neutral things and then they were neutral things. Lydia mentioned a daytime show that had called and how she was going to say no because she could hear her mother\u2019s voice and also her own. Rowena mentioned a grant for the youth club\u2019s roof repairs that had grown a paragraph overnight because she had realised she was appealing to a panel that had never been fourteen in Crawley. They parted with a joke about sauce and the right kind of basil and neither of them felt thirteen. When she passed the bakery window on the way out, iced buns shone as usual and she felt the town bless her with its ordinary.\n\nIn the evenings, when work was done and nothing was on fire except the three small fires that always are and can be put out with email and carrot cake, Rowena sat with Priya and built the calendar for the months ahead. They wrote down the summer fair where the orchestra would play again and the old men would argue about whether the trestle tables had always been that wobbly. They wrote down the open day two for the centre because one open day had bred expectations like rabbits. They pencilled in time for a holiday that neither of them truly believed she would take and then inked in two days in August when she would turn her phone off and see if the town remained standing, which it would. They left room for Kiki\u2019s follow-up, not because Rowena craved more light but because light had proven itself an employee willing to work overtime if given a fair wage and occasional biscuits.\n\nOne evening, when the sky browned too early and the smell of petrol decided to be melancholy, she walked to the Memorial Gardens again with a bag of bread that was not stale enough and a mind that wanted to rehearse arguments for meetings that would never happen. The violinist was there, of course, because the town loved its characters and tried to return them to their spots each time. He played the almost-waltz and then, instead of finishing, he began something that crawled under the ribs and made a home. The terrier had acquired a scarf against sense. The old man with the bin liner fought a new bin and won with dignity. A teenager practised a skateboard trick that the laws of physics had attempted to outlaw. Rowena watched and let the music tell her bones to stop auditioning for tragedies that would never be staged.\n\nShe danced a little, the size she had promised Kiki and herself she would always leave room for. It wasn\u2019t a rebellion. It was a note to self delivered on time. A woman sitting on the far bench took out her phone and did not film, and Rowena loved her for it in the quiet way you love someone who refuses to make a gift into content. On her way out of the park she saw a poster for the council\u2019s consultation on public art and smiled because one of the questions would be about graffiti and she had paint under her nails that would never come out, not because she was sloppy but because some colours decide you belong to them.\n\nShe went home and found Jean applying balm to her bruise with the concentration of a person varnishing their best table, and she told her about light and tomatoes and walls that had become sentences. Jean listened and then took her hand and turned it over the way you do when you are checking for splinters. \u201cYou look longer,\u201d she said, which was not about height and not about pride and not about hair. \u201cAre you less cross with the world or more capable of carrying the crossness?\u201d Rowena thought about it while the kettle tried to race the weather. \u201cI think I figured out you don\u2019t have to choose between being a giver and being seen,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I thought you did. And I\u2019ve been very dramatic about it for months like a woman in a gown on a staircase.\u201d\n\n\u201cDramatic is just another word for honest when the audience is wrong,\u201d Jean said. \u201cDrink your tea before it thinks about being work.\u201d\n\nThe days continued, as they are contractually obliged to, and Rowena kept doing the things that had always been hers with a new economy of fear. Lydia sent a picture of her mother dancing in a kitchen wearing socks and admitted she had not asked for permission. Jonah sent a picture of a bus ticket with smudged ink and asked, absurdly, if she thought smudges had souls. Priya sent a spreadsheet with conditional formatting that looked almost festive and then sent, less cheerfully, the news that the council was considering repurposing the little library branch in Gossops Green and calling it \u201credistribution,\u201d which meant murder. Rowena put on her coat and sharpened her kindest voice because this, more than dancing, had always been the bit she was built for.\n\nAt the meeting, which was held in a room designed by a person with strong opinions about beige, she used her waltz shoulders to stand taller than the opposition and she used her shop-floor vocabulary to make sure the people who could never afford to say the word \u201cimpact\u201d out loud were accounted for. She asked the deputy something that sounded gentle and left a bruise. She reminded them that a library is a place where children go to meet adults who are not related to them and behave anyway. She mentioned the youth orchestra\u2019s sheet music and the girls in Thursday class who had been seen reading before, but perhaps not lovingly. When they tried to tell her about budgets, she said buckets, and when they said centralised, she said walked to and warm. She didn\u2019t win that night because real things rarely are won at seven-thirty by someone with good hair and a clipboard. She started something that had the decency to take time.\n\nOn a night that had the pale look of a kettle again \u2014 late summer wears that colour as if it had a right to \u2014 she took the blue dress out of its garment bag to air it and found that it still smelled faintly of powder and effort. She touched the ribbon like it held a word she had forgotten. She didn\u2019t try it on because clothes have memories that can make you either stupid or brave, and she wanted to be neither on a Tuesday. She hung it on the back of the bedroom door and let it be a thing that had happened and didn\u2019t have to argue its case.\n\nShe took her shoes off like a ceremony and stood in the kitchen with her feet on the square of lino where the old house kept its luck. Jean came in and said something about swans and heating bills that wasn\u2019t an argument unless you wanted it to be, and Rowena stepped into the small bit they hadn\u2019t rehearsed, the dance between the kettle\u2019s click and the pour. It was ridiculous and decent, which is really the honest middle of life. She counted to three and then four and then three again, because time is a toy if you\u2019re gentle with it. She turned very slightly to the left, and the doughnuts on the counter did not shed any sugar, and somewhere the violinist tuned his bow and the terrier dreamed of bread, and Crawley did what it always did, which was make a day behave.Chapter Seven\n\nBy the time the leaves decided to do drama on the pavements, Crawley had gone soft around the edges in that way towns do when they know rain is coming and don\u2019t want to make a fuss. The buses wore ochre like a uniform. The bakery\u2019s windows fogged as if they were trying to remember a name. Rowena stood in line behind a man buying a single sausage roll and a woman buying enough iced buns to start a political movement, and she read the new notice blu-tacked to the post office door about \u201credistribution of cultural assets\u201d with the kind of politeness reserved for rude relatives. The library consultation had harvested euphemisms like a bumper crop. We will rationalise access, it said, as if reading were a train and timetables solved everything. She bought a loaf that was more crust than crumb because it made toasting feel like work and tucked it under her arm like a document she meant to argue with.\n\nBack upstairs, the door stuck with its usual piety. Priya was at her desk with three mugs, one of which was a threat to national stability, and an envelope the shade of old cream. \u201cThere\u2019s a letter that wants to change your week,\u201d she said, sliding it across the desk with a finger as if it might bite. \u201cHand-delivered by a man in a tweed cap who smelt of camphor and entirely understood the concept of gravitas.\u201d\n\nThe paper inside had weight. It had a crest that looked like a bird reconsidering flight. Mrs. Frances Mallory, who had come to every jumble sale for thirty years with a bag of immaculate napkins and a face that did not apologise for wanting what she wanted, had died at home in a chair that had a patina of secrets, and had left her house to the Leigh Trust. There were conditions. The back garden was to remain a garden, not paved for cars. The front room was to be used once a month for a tea dance, \u201cin memory of my Henry who trod lightly, even on my toes.\u201d The cats were to be rehomed with \u201cwomen of good character and the correct cardigan,\u201d and there was a sentence about the piano that was both specific and tender: it must be tuned by hand, not by app. There was also, tucked in like a worried thought, a modest sum to keep the roof from forming opinions about the weather.\n\nPriya read over her shoulder, lips moving silently at the phrase \u201cwomen of good character.\u201d \u201cMrs. Mallory,\u201d she said, with a breath that wasn\u2019t quite a laugh, \u201chas posthumously made you an events manager with birdsong. This is either an absolute gift or a beautiful trap.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a house,\u201d Rowena said, as if she could return it like a dress with the tags on. \u201cHouses argue. They need gutters and men with ladders who never turn up and neighbours who lounge at their windows like judges. We are not good at ownership. We are good at moving money like air.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer solicitor\u2019s note suggests she thought you were good at holding what needed holding,\u201d Priya said, turning the page to the clause about hedge heights. \u201cAnd I hate to tell you, but I\u2019ve already fallen in love with the idea of a tea dance named after a dead man who was obviously adored. Imagine the old men dusting off their waistcoats. Imagine the youth orchestra pretending to be Deco. Imagine Jonah doing a box step without irony in a room with a piano whose lid has opinions.\u201d\n\nRowena put her head in her hands and then took it out again because hiding had never been her skill. \u201cWe need a board decision,\u201d she said, practical returning like a tide. \u201cWe need to check the roof and the boiler and whether Mrs. Mallory was a woman who liked having three spare keys because if she wasn\u2019t, we are looking at locksmiths at ungodly hours. We need to find cardiganed women who can tolerate cats with old habits.\u201d\n\n\u201cDone, done, and the WI knows everything there is to know about cats and cardigans,\u201d Priya said, ticking off items in a notebook which had not yet failed to manifest what it wrote. \u201cBoard on Monday? I\u2019ll bring biscuits that tell people they are capable. And I will casually ask Simon whether he knows someone who can persuade a hedge to stop aspiring to be a tree.\u201d\n\nBefore biscuits and boards and hedges, there was the library. The consultation session was to be held in the big room at the council offices with the acoustics of an apology. Rowena had decided she would not arrive late, and of course Crawley decided to be early by producing a bus that came on time and thus upset her schedule. In the foyer stood a display of flower arrangements that were making a brave case for chrysanthemums. Kiki hovered with a clipboard and a smile that said she had sworn not to film but could not promise not to organise. \u201cWe\u2019ll do a read-in,\u201d she murmured, as if saying it quietly could keep it from becoming a headline. \u201cAfter. If they announce a nonsense. Rugs, lamps, normal voices. No placards. We\u2019ll sit and outlast them.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring thermoses. Bring sweater-wearing children,\u201d Rowena said. \u201cBring a man with a book on plumbing to confuse them.\u201d She had Jean with her because Jean did not do theatrics and the sight of her in a cardigan that could have doubled as a moral stance changed the temperature of rooms. They took seats near a radiator that hissed as if it had secrets it needed to tell.\n\nThe deputy leader tried to speak softly. He had the face of a man who had forgotten how to enjoy pie. He said things about budgets that were buckets, and Rowena watched the faces around her for the moment when numbers cease to be numbers and become a story about whether you matter. A mother with two toddlers on her lap asked if the centralised library would move closer to the bus stop because she had arms not wings. An old man who had learned to read at fifty-two because he had decided shame could go to hell said he liked the smell of Gossops Green\u2019s carpets, and that he didn\u2019t want to lose the only place in a three-bus radius where nobody tried to sell him anything. Priya, when her turn came, drew shapes in the air with her hand as if access had geometry. She talked about the Thursday girl who had been told her body was for thinking and had been ambushed by books that suggested otherwise. Rowena spoke like a person trying to land a small plane in weather. She did not plead. She named things: faces, routes walked, chairs moulded to backs that had done long days. \u201cIf you make a library into a theory,\u201d she said, \u201cyou will have no stories to put on your posters at election time.\u201d\n\nAfter, they did the read-in. It is a wonder how quickly a room can become a living room if people bring their own cushions and a willingness to behave as if tea helps. Someone had thought to bring fairy lights. Someone had the good sense to bring a plugboard that would pass any inspection short of an inquisition. The youth orchestra\u2019s flautist played something that wasn\u2019t quite a song and wasn\u2019t quite a sigh. The boy who made beats read out the packaging of a cereal box in a tone that made it sound like Shakespeare, and the room applauded as if he had delivered a sonnet. Jean read a recipe as if it were scripture. Lydia arrived quietly, wearing a hat that dared anyone to mention it, and sat on the floor and read from a book of poems in a voice that remembered it had once been small. Kiki had not brought a camera and Simon kept his hands in his pockets in the exact posture of a man who understands devotions.\n\nJonah came and didn\u2019t take up space with anything except his knees and the grin he gives children. When a child with a runny nose climbed into his lap as if humans were part of the furniture, he adjusted his body the way tall men learn to. He caught Rowena\u2019s eye over the small head and for a second there was no council, no bucket, no buckets within buckets; there was just the moment when someone else\u2019s child decides your lap is the best place for hearing about worlds that aren\u2019t on fire. They read until the radiators stopped hissing and any councillors still in the building understood at a level they didn\u2019t know they had that this was a fight they could not win without looking like people who did not like babies. The deputy leader came out at the end, hatless and humbled by the presence of a hundred pairs of shoes in an administrative foyer, and said that no decisions would be taken that evening. It was both cowardice and grace. It was enough.\n\nThe Mallory house smelled like lavender and furniture polish and bread that had once been made with more patience than yeast. The hedge was, indeed, ambitious. The cats were three sisters called Persephone, Mint, and June, who regarded Rowena with the thin contempt of beings who expect canned tuna on a schedule. The front room had wallpaper printed with discreet roses that had weathered years of Christmas cards blu-tacked to their stems. The piano sat under a lace runner like a dowager. The solicitor, a man who tried not to appear charmed and failed, handed over keys that had the ceremonial weight of a minor coronation. \u201cShe believed you would make of this something un-sad,\u201d he said, then checked his watch as if he had somewhere less implausible to be.\n\nThe board had opinions. Colin, who wore shirts like statements and believed assets to be a verb, wanted to sell and turn houses into bread. A woman named Dawn, whose grandmother had been a charwoman and whose daughter was an archivist, wanted to keep the house and the hedge and the tea dances and perhaps move in and make jam. Priya did a graph in her head, then translated it. \u201cWe could keep it on a trial,\u201d she said. \u201cThree months. We hold one tea dance, a book club with biscuits, and a Tuesday mending circle. If it becomes a mouth we cannot feed, we sell with conditions and use the proceeds to throw chairs at problems. If it becomes a heart, we let it beat.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if we make it both,\u201d Jean said, from the corner, having come along with the air of a woman who could calm cats and trustees with the same sentence. \u201cA house that pays for the chairs. Charge a small nothing for tea. Ask men who believe in engines to sponsor the piano. Sell jam at the door in summer. A house can make its own bread if you let it.\u201d The board, which had learned to trust Jean\u2019s kitchen logic more than any consultant\u2019s proposal, nodded. They took a vote that was less a vote than a sigh of relief. The house would breathe.\n\nThe first tea dance landed on a Saturday when the weather couldn\u2019t be bothered to pick a mood. Andy appeared with bunting because he had bunting for every eventuality and because he loved old wood with a fidelity that made the piano preen. Jonah pressed his hands to keys and made them answer like old friends who still remember your weekend name. He taught simple turns with the authority of a man who had not been paid to be authoritative but had earned it anyway. The WI arrived with cakes that had no business involving that much cream. Men who had once worn suits to work wore them again and discovered the mothballs had not eaten dignity. The youth orchestra sent a quartet who could manage \u201cMoon River\u201d and an irrelevant but welcome tango; Jonah smuggled in a waltz that made the floor remember being new.\n\nRowena moved through it all as if she were arranging stars. She found chairs for bad knees. She found the right kind of silence for the widow who had come because she had promised herself she would and then regretted it until Jonah took her hand for a turn that required only fingers and a memory of shoulders. She made sure the piano had a photograph of Mrs. Mallory and her Henry propped on it so that no one named a room after them without knowing their faces. She danced exactly twice. Once with Jean, who had worn sensible shoes for a fight and then decided to wear them for joy, and once with Jonah, where they did a box step with intentional incompetence that made the children laugh and the old men declare them worth feeding. There was no footage. There was a woman with a sketchbook who caught them in lines and shade and said she would bring the drawing next week because goodness required time to dry.\n\nIt stormed the night the electricians were meant to begin the car park lights, a tantrum of weather that made bin lids into cymbals and repeatedly asked the town if it had finished with its umbrellas. Power lines sulked. The community centre was asked by the universe to be a lighthouse and obliged. Priya sent a text that read \u201cwarm hub?\u201d and when Rowena arrived with kettles and extension leads and biscuits that were mainly apology and sugar, the hall was already full of people who had decided their houses were too quiet when the plugs stopped behaving. Jonah turned up with a duffle that contained blankets and a thermos he swore could heat soup by glaring. Simon brought candles but then didn\u2019t light them because a firefighter who happened to be there did a talk about safety in the tone of a man who had seen curtains misbehave. The youth orchestra, minus sodden brass, came with violins and a drum that didn\u2019t need the grid, and they made a sound that felt like bread smelled.\n\nThey did not dance because the floor was a place for people to put the smallness of their worry, but later, when the noise was down to a hum and the air had softened from damp to human, Jonah put on the radio on his phone and found a waltz hiding in static. They stood near the noticeboard with its complicated fliers and did the smallest version their bodies knew, knees barely saying yes. It felt like mending. It felt like the moral opposite of triumph. Jean watched from a chair with a throw over her knees and smiled the smile she reserved for the moment a stubborn jar finally opened.\n\nIn the morning, the town had the hangover of a place that had had opinions about thunder. The lights in the car park got done in a hurry as if contrition were a budget line. The library sent an email that used the word \u201creconsideration,\u201d which is not sorry but next door to it, and invited Rowena to a meeting \u201cto discuss community-led supplementary hours,\u201d which is politician for come save this with cake. She told Priya to look out the rota and the chalkboard and to find pens that made tired people feel competent. Mark offered to man a Saturday shift provided he could read plays aloud in a ridiculous voice for children, and Rowena said that ridiculous voices are how you win wars. The skateboard boy volunteered to reshelve on the condition that he didn\u2019t have to talk to anyone, and then spoke to everyone and reminded them to sign the sheet.\n\nKiki came to film the lights for her follow-up, and she did it like a friend, not a thief. She watched as the floodlit corners filled with teenagers who could now pretend to be moody safely. She shot the exact way the light fell on an old pair of shoes and a child\u2019s scooter because detail persuades more than declarations. She put Jean on camera and asked her one question and let the silence afterwards be the answer. She did not ask for a sob. She caught a laugh.\n\nJonah sat at Rowena\u2019s kitchen table on a Wednesday wearing a jumper that had ambitions and a face that was trying to be sensible. He had vacillated for a week. He had written a pros and cons list and then burned it because lists are deceivers. The company in London had sent an email that used the delightful phrase \u201cseason of opportunity,\u201d which Rowena had vowed never to deploy. \u201cThey want me for six months,\u201d he said, leaning his cheek into his hand like a boy who has just admitted breaking a window. \u201cIt\u2019s not a tour. It\u2019s a run. It\u2019s not gone-gone, more away-then-back, with no guarantees except the guarantee of sore feet.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want it?\u201d she asked, and she did not say we. She made no shape with her face that would push him. She buttered toast like a person who had committed to buttering toast well.\n\n\u201cSome of me,\u201d he said, honest as bread. \u201cThe bit of me that still thinks of rooms where people argue about what art is and then dance anyway. The bit of me that wants to be a room like that for other people. The bit of me that likes floors that have witnessed. I don\u2019t want to be away from here enough to let here shrink.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere won\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cHere has elbows.\u201d She poured tea with a concentration that could have auditioned for the Royal Conservatoire. \u201cTake it. Or don\u2019t. But don\u2019t not take it because of me. Don\u2019t take it because of me. I am not a season. I am a postcode. Come back to it. Or tell me where to send parcels to when you stop eating anything other than actors\u2019 canteen soup.\u201d\n\nHe laughed, relief messing his hair. \u201cI\u2019ll come back,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are very persuasive when you pretend you aren\u2019t trying.\u201d He reached across the table and covered her hand with his in a way that had no spectacle in it and therefore contained everything. \u201cCome see it when we get to the bit where cheap tickets go to friends,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ll do a little bow in the direction of your seat so you can tell me afterwards if it looked like an apology.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t bow like an apology. Bow like a bus,\u201d she said, because nonsense can hold emotion without letting it leak. \u201cAnd go see your grandmother and tell her the ironing can stop now because the shirts are frightened.\u201d\n\nThey did the first Saturday at the library with cake and chaos in equal measure. Children sat cross-legged with the discipline of explorers. The mother with arms not wings came in and read under the warm lamp and forgot her phone on purpose. The deputy leader brought his daughter and hummed in a way he would pretend he hadn\u2019t later. The boys who preferred shelves to people reshelved and spoke in grunts and then full sentences when someone asked them about a series they loved. Rowena ran the till and answered questions and pointed teenagers to books that would not sneer at them. Priya worked the rota like a bus timetable. Jean took the arm of a man who could not quite manage steps and put him in a chair with a view of the noticeboard where all the desperate and hopeful things are pinned. Lydia read again and did not expect to be applauded but was.\n\nThe newspaper printed something that tried to be sniffy and turned, at the last paragraph, into praise by accident. The letters page contained a missive on lined paper from a woman who signed herself only as A Reader and who hoped the people in charge had noticed that sometimes leadership looks like putting a kettle on and arranging chairs in a circle. The editor ran it because even editors sometimes want their mothers to be proud. Priya cut it out and stuck it on the office wall with tape that had outlasted expectations.\n\nWhen the painters came to the Mallory house to make the front room less tired and more itself, the boy with the chalk art asked if he could paint the shutters with something Mrs. Mallory would have liked. Rowena asked him what that might be and he said, without flourish, \u201cBirds that aren\u2019t in cages,\u201d and she wrote the sentence down in the margin of a grant application as if it were a commandment. He painted swallows that seemed to be coming home from a very long day. People stopped when they passed and felt the little lift a good line can give you. Mrs. Mallory\u2019s cats, rehomed with three cardiganed women who had opinions about trifle and politics, visited for a week as if making sure the house would cope.\n\nRowena went to see Mark\u2019s student production in a black box theatre that had started life as a storage facility for costumes and now did its best to play at being art. His director wore the same scarf every day as promised and had sharp shoulders that made him look constantly in motion. The play was about debt and dance and databases and, against all odds, made sense. Mark played a man who tried not to be kind because the world had told him kindness was soft, and then discovered softness can pull you out of a burning car because it keeps you whole. After the curtain call, during which three mothers clapped as if they were trying to convince the building to stay upright, Mark cried in the friendly way boys cry when they have been brave in public and are permitted the aftershock. \u201cMy mum filmed it vertical by accident,\u201d he said helplessly delighted. \u201cI told her it\u2019s a crime. She told me she birthed me. We agreed to disagree.\u201d\n\nOn the walk back to the station she told him the library would need a Saturday stage manager and that she had thought of him because he understood chairs and feelings. He grinned and said yes before she finished asking because he has learned that yes is often a hinge rather than a wall. On the train she watched the dark go by and felt that particular satisfaction of having sat in a chair designed for someone else and clapped with a hand that had held other people\u2019s forms all day.\n\nLydia texted that she had been offered a Christmas special that would involve sequins and novelty and a Santa with more charisma than wisdom. She sent the message from a train that smelled of crisps and copper coins. \u201cI said no,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019m learning the word and putting it in sentences. I told my mother. She said, \u2018How will people see you?\u2019 I said, \u2018In Tesco, Ma. By the tomatoes.\u2019\u201d Rowena wrote back a picture of the Mallory house bunting with a caption about light and hedges and groundedness and then put her phone down and let herself laugh.\n\nThe company in London released publicity shots with Jonah in them, and Priya printed one out and stuck it on the noticeboard next to the letters page and a flyer for a jumble sale at St. Mark\u2019s. The photograph tried to make him into a person with angles sharp enough to bend light, and he let it fail. In his eyes was the exact lack of apology Rowena had fallen in love with somewhere between stringing fairy lights and buying extra bin liners. She took the train one Saturday, the one that insists on being late when you have planned to be early, and stood at the back of a theatre that used to be a cinema and watched him carry a story that had been badly written in its first draft and redeemed by bodies doing what bodies can do when they have been asked nicely. He bowed like a bus, and she pretended it had nothing to do with her and then privately accepted it like a biscuit.\n\nOn the way home, a small fight with a gull for chips she was not even currently eating taught her that humility comes in feathers. She arrived back to find a note pushed under the office door in copperplate that made her think of school registers. \u201cPlease could someone teach me to dance,\u201d it said. \u201cI am seventy-three. No past. No fuss. Tuesdays are best.\u201d The signature was simply Eileen. She took the note home and put it under a magnet shaped like a teapot and decided that Tuesday was, in fact, best. She would call Eileen and tell her to bring shoes that told the truth.\n\nThe library vote came up on a Monday with weather that had wandered in from another county. The council went through a dozen items that mattered less while the room dipped in and out of attention. When they finally reached the bit with the ache in it, the deputy leader spoke first and did not perform contrition but did perform sense. They would keep the branch. Hours would be trimmed but not savaged. Saturday would happen if the community could guarantee bodies and kettles. They would repaint. They would listen when people told them that a child had cried when told that the books would move across town and become harder to hold. It was not a victory. It was a place to stand and see if the ground stayed.\n\nAfter, in the square that tries its best with pigeons and benches that have opinions about teenagers, somebody started to sing a song that did not have a chorus you could remember and everyone hummed anyway. Rowena bought two cones of chips and handed one to Priya, who accepted it like an award and then spilled curry sauce on her shoe. Simon took a photograph without being a photographer and sent it later with no caption because he had finally learned restraint. Jean linked her arm through Rowena\u2019s and said, \u201cYour shoulders look less argumentative,\u201d which was her way of telling her daughter she looked happy without alarming her.\n\nThey launched the Tuesday mending circle at the Mallory house with a table that had seen better days and enough thread to rig a sail. Eileen came, hair in a no-nonsense bun, and learned a slow turn as if it were a recipe she had been denied. The boy with the chalk art sat on the doorstep and drew the street in reverse. The cats visited their old house and inspected everyone\u2019s knitting and nodded without smiling. Jonah sent a picture of his dressing room with the note, \u201cThe mirror does not tell the truth. I\u2019m writing on a napkin. Post soon.\u201d Lydia wrote to say her mother had, without warning, danced in the kitchen to a song about crumbs. Kiki passed through like weather, warmed everyone and left behind a neat stack of consent forms and three croissants.\n\nOn an evening with light like rinsed glass, Rowena and Jonah met at a pub where the jukebox had a sense of humour and the countryside was an allegation. They argued amiably about bus routes because intimacy is sometimes practice for disagreement. He told her about a boy in his company who had never eaten soup that touched bread and had cried when he found out what was allowed. She told him about a councillor who had never sat in a library on a Saturday and had cried when he saw who did. They danced a bit on the way out because the jukebox could be persuaded to play something like a waltz if you were patient and bribed it with coins. A woman smoking near the bins clapped and told them not to get married because it ruined your knees, and they thanked her gravely because unsolicited advice deserves dignity.\n\nLate, in her kitchen, when the kettle did its reliable theatre, Rowena took the blue dress down from its hook to check the ribbon hadn\u2019t sulked in its sleep, and then put it back because there is power in not retrying a thing you don\u2019t need to prove. She stood where the lino remembers dances and moved a little in bare feet without agenda. Outside, the town practised being itself against the window. Inside, she put a hand flat on the counter like a promise and let her bones count to three, then four, then three again, because time, once tamed, sometimes comes when called. The night didn\u2019t require her. It did not ask her to bargain. It allowed her to make a day behave without watching, which is perhaps the finest compliment a place can give.Chapter Eight\n\nThe morning began with a sky the colour of washing-up water after a party, that particular grey that tells you weather is going to have opinions all day and you can either dignify them or laugh. Rowena walked from the bus stop with a loaf under her arm and a plan in her head that had more arrows than boxes, and the town offered up its usual chorus of the almost and the nearly: a lorry threatening to become a traffic story, a gull considering a bag of crisps above its station, a woman in a luminous jacket telling a man with a ladder that no, she did not need an estimate, she needed a miracle. At the office the door stuck and she blessed it because friction is proof of life, and Priya lifted her face from a spreadsheet with the satisfaction of someone who had won an argument with a column and would forget to tell anyone about it. She had an envelope with corners that remembered other corners, and she held it two fingers' width above the desk as if to give it chance to be light.\n\nIt had the Mallory solicitor\u2019s return address, which made Rowena\u2019s stomach do a small, mean thing, because bodies remember bills like an old disagreement. Inside was not a bill, but a note written in a hand that paused where it could and sprinted when forced by habit. The roof, it said in sentences that tried to be gentle, had developed a leak in the thoughtless way roofs do, and the man who had for years appeased it with tar and murmurs had run out of murmurs. The leak would become a complaint and the complaint would become a scandal if addressed with anything less than scaffolding. The sum attached to the solution was not catastrophic and not kind; it was one of those numbers that demands a meeting with the board and a biscuit that believes in you. \u201cWe can do it,\u201d Priya said, instantly and with that maddeningly cheerful confidence she wore like a cardigan, and Rowena nodded because public optimism is the accountant of private terror.\n\nThey went to the house together with a set of keys that pretended to know which lock they belonged to and a package of biscuits that was probably not part of any official list of supplies. The hedge, deciding for once to be helpful, shushed them in, and the cats belonged to other cardigans now and so did not appear, leaving the hallway less scorned, more available. The front room smelled like a memory baked at a low temperature, and in the back where the leak had had its say, a bucket stood on a tapestry mat as if it had been born to perform and had suffered no rehearsal. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to persuade that corner to stop philosophising,\u201d Priya said, looking up where the plaster had chosen a tide line, and then she leaned her head to one side because the house had decided to speak.\n\nThere was a stair, narrow and polite, that no one had bothered since the house had been bequeathed. It led to a half-room under the roof that would not have impressed a council inspector and had an effect on the heart akin to opening a drawer you didn\u2019t know existed. The window was small and city-facing, which in Crawley means chimney-facing, and there was a trunk against the wall with buckles that had insisted on living longer than the people who had closed them. It would have been like the book if it had been empty. It was not. Inside, under a layer of paper that used to be white and had contented itself with cream, were shoes that had danced when the words for dances had longer names, and programmes printed on card soft enough to be kind. There were photographs, the kind where people learned to respect cameras and stood properly, Mrs. Mallory young enough to be amazed by a hat, Henry healthy in that dangerous way men used to wear their shoulders, a room full of faces eager to be well-behaved in a photograph so they could behave less well once it was put away.\n\nRowena lifted a pair of shoes that had been loved into the exact shape of a foot, and she knew the exact day Mrs. Mallory had decided not to throw them away. The programmes were a run of months, tea dances and charity nights in halls that pretended to be ballrooms, with pencilled notes in a hand that surely belonged to Frances or to someone who loved her. \u201cThe quickstep is our argument, dear H,\u201d one read in the margin of a flyer advertising the Pavilion in \u201858, and farther down, \u201cwaltz tonight, be good, be true, be caught.\u201d There was a letter folded so the crease might outlast sense, from a woman named Eileen on paper that had yellowness for ancestry, thanking Frances for \u201cthe loan of that silver brooch and the loan of your courage,\u201d the short paragraph ending with a postscript that could have been showy and wasn\u2019t: \u201cHenry made me feel I had ankles.\u201d\n\nPriya picked up the letter and read it aloud because sometimes the best way to respect a thing is to let it be heard twice. \u201cEileen,\u201d she said, and then looked up, because Eileen had been in the mending circle two days out of three and had danced a slow turn as if learning the shape of her own foot and its stubbornness. \u201cOur Eileen is the Eileen,\u201d she said, and the room did that thing rooms do when a name reaches across decades and sits down comfortably. They stood there for a while, not doing anything silly like weeping or making vows to plasterboard, and then they carried the trunk downstairs as if it contained confidence.\n\nThe board would need numbers and noises and a plan that involved jam. Rowena knew that. She also knew that a good story told at the right time can sell a hundred chairs and at least one ladder. She put the programmes on the piano and the letter where people would see it without touching, and she called Eileen and asked her if she would come to the house with the consent of someone being asked to pose for a painting. Eileen turned up in a skirt that meant business and eyes that watered at everything and refused to be accused of it. She touched the shoe and then, in a movement so small it almost wasn't, put it against her own foot. \u201cI never told anyone about that night,\u201d she said, and it came out like a boiled sweet unwrapped by a child who had been told to wait. \u201cI was seventeen and looked it, and he was gentle with my silliness. He made my sister jealous without trying and reminded me to breathe as if I had been holding my breath in a queue for years. Frances laughed at us as if laughter could be stored. I\u2019d kept the letter in my wardrobe until my sixties and then put it in the trunk because I thought it deserved wood.\u201d\n\nThey made tea and there was a slowness to the pouring that turned it into ceremony. Eileen did not insist on telling the whole of anything, and Rowena did not insist on asking. Priya, who did not interfere in other people\u2019s pacing unless a bus was involved, suggested very quietly that the house could do with dancing in its original language, just once, to persuade the roof that effort was being made. \u201cA night for Henry and Frances,\u201d she said, and the title had the kind of symmetry that fundraisers respect. \u201cWe\u2019ll call it the First Proper Tea Dance because we have no sense and we like the word proper. We\u2019ll bake a cake in the shape of a house and then pretend we didn\u2019t. We\u2019ll ask the youth orchestra to wear black and white, which will ruin several homes\u2019 dignity, and we\u2019ll give Jonah a list of songs that makes him think we\u2019ve been burgling his records.\u201d\n\nThere were practicalities that were less romance and more mop, but Rowena felt the tug of a night that could make a number in a solicitor\u2019s letter blush. She talked to Andy about dresses that respect knees and to the WI about sandwiches that act as ballast; she wrote to the three cardiganed cat-women to ask if Mint, who had the temperament of a headmistress with a hangover, could be brought for an hour to sit on the piano and make a survey of all ankles present; she asked the registrar about the capacity of rooms in ways that proved she had learned not to get told off by the fire brigade. She phoned Jonah while he was on a lunch break, which is not a thing the theatre grants lightly, and asked if he could come not as the telly man but as the boy who had learned to keep time with people whose feet were frightened. He said the company schedule would try to keep him, and then he did a clever thing with a quiet voice and got out.\n\nThe day before the dance, a reporter from a national paper called and then realised he had expected a story that involved sequins and another woman\u2019s failure. Rowena refused to be brash and refused to be ashamed, which left him with very little to chew on, and she gave him Mrs. Mallory\u2019s exact stipulation about cats because it would humanise a house faster than any adjective. He asked her if she worried she had become a brand, and she said she worried she had become a kettle because people expected her to boil on cue, and he laughed and she did not. Kiki\u2019s message pinged an hour later from a train that could not decide whether it was going to stop where it had been told to. She wanted, in exquisite language that had earned her a budget and a hug, to bring a small crew to the tea dance and catch a minute of the room without getting in the way of jam. Rowena considered and said yes but with rules so hygienic they might have been written by a nurse in 1951. \u201cOnly medium shots,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNo close-ups of anyone who did not sign up for a close-up. No filming of tears that haven\u2019t been formally introduced.\u201d\n\nThe morning of the dance had the nervousness of any house that knows it\u2019s about to host relatives who will either be generous or judge the curtains. The roof had been politely propped with tarpaulin and hope, and the front room had been dressed with bunting that made older men pat it when they thought no one was looking. The piano had remembered its point and sat with its lid lifted like a question. Frances\u2019s photograph lived in a frame loaned by Mrs. Croft, who came to everything since her husband had died because she knew how grief goes out at night and eats biscuits if left unsupervised. Eileen arrived with a brooch that had been made to look like a star and wobble like a leaf, and she pinned it below her collarbone with hands that were not assuming they had the right. Jean stood in the doorway and consented to being kissed by people who thought of her as the conscience of the place; she wore shoes that told the truth and stockings that gave away nothing.\n\nThe youth orchestra had found a clarinetist who could play the kind of nonsense people call the golden oldies without blushing, and they did \u201cMoonglow\u201d as if it had been written to pay for a roof in Crawley. Jonah, who had got there by some miracle involving a broken-down van and a bus driver with Lent in his bones, slipped in without ceremony and went straight to the piano, where he put his hands down like a benediction. He played a waltz that would never be recorded and could never be repeated because it was made of the people in the room and the weather, which had decided to be impressed and therefore behave. No one clapped in a way that would make a person embarrassed; they clapped in the way you clap when you recognise your own body in someone else\u2019s kindness.\n\nRowena took people\u2019s coats and took money from people who insisted on disguising it as cake, and she handed older women to chairs with the practised tenderness of a person who puts dignity into the cups with the tea. Colin from the board turned up in a tie that had anxious birds on it and apologised with his whole posture for having ever said sell, and then danced with a woman he had divorced in 1996 for two minutes that made his face not his own. The cats did not come because Mint was in a mood and Persephone had decided she was too old for piano lids, but June consented to sit in the window watching, which is what she does best, and everyone who noticed took this as luck. Kiki kept her camera\u2019s distance and did a strange thing: she put it down sometimes, and drank tea in order to be a person, and Simon held the spare batteries in his palm like he was warming them and looked content to be paid in crumbs.\n\nAt the edge of all of this, Rowena and Jonah did not dance first because being the first couple is not always a compliment. They moved when the floor had become itself and the room could not misunderstand them as a performance. They formed a frame that said, I am going to ask you to be brave with me for exactly three minutes, and she rested her hand in a way that admitted an intimacy without terrifying anyone. He counted quietly into her wrist as if reminding her that time is negotiable if you have two bodies trying. They made their way past Mrs. Croft, who muttered \u201clook at them, behaving,\u201d and past Eileen, who stood for a second as if to hold her own bones accountable, and then sat because her stories were heavy now and could only be carried by someone else\u2019s son at a piano. When the song ended, there was a small thing like the town letting its breath go, and the tin under the donations table had money in it that did not apologise.\n\nThey reached the number that would pay a scaffolder who had the decency to answer his phone and the decency to charge slightly less than market because his mother had told him to, and they reached it well before the last slice of cake had been cut. Rowena had the satisfaction of pretending not to notice while Priya did the exact opposite across the room, counting quietly in her head like a drummer with a stolen calculator. When people began to leave, they left slowly, because you don\u2019t hurry a room that has turned into a solution; they said things that looked like compliments and felt like more than that, and more than one of them forced money into Rowena\u2019s hand as if her hand was some sort of amino acid required for survival. Eileen stayed until the piano had been closed and the biscuits had been promoted to the back door for sharing with the starlings, and then she took her brooch off and put it into Rowena\u2019s hand and said, \u201cHold it for the next girl who forgets her ankles and thinks she is not made for turning.\u201d Rowena put it in the drawer where she kept the keys to the house, and later she moved it to the drawer where she kept courage, which looked to other people like a sewing basket.\n\nThe morning after is always a Tuesday, even when the calendar insists it is not, and the town wore its usual face and then glanced at itself in a passing window, pleased without boasting. The roofers came with hats and radios and a respect for the piano that endeared them to Jean, who fed them biscuits as if she had hired them and, in a way, had. The youth orchestra sent a thank-you card hand-lettered by the clarinetist, which had a sticker of a trumpet that had seen better papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 days, and on the back a drawing from the flautist that appeared to be a cat playing a waltz, which everyone agreed was anatomically unconvincing and emotionally precise. Priya wore a grin that frightened the council and the editor and made the dentist sigh with resignation because grins do nothing for molar grinding.\n\nThere were dull difficulties too, because romance is not a substitute for maintenance. The council\u2019s procurement department wanted three quotes for every ladder, Carole from accounts insisted Eileen\u2019s brooch count as an asset in the ledger until Rowena put her finger on the page and said, \u201cNo,\u201d in a tone that suggested the day would go on without that particular absurdity, and an anonymous email arrived that accused them of taking attention away from problems that had fewer posters. Rowena did what she had learned to do with anonymous emails, which was to send them to Priya, who laughed in a kind way and then filed them under \u201csound and fury,\u201d and then wrote to the person whose name she could not see as if kindness could bounce off the screen and land somewhere useful, asking them for coffee, which they would never take because anonymity is intoxicating and coffee makes it sober.\n\nJonah went back to London and the run, which had decided he was useful and therefore demanded to keep him on a stage that smelled of dust and expensive compromises. He would send photographs now and then of dressing room announcements and shoes that had new scuffs to brag about, and she would send him images of the ordinary doing its best: the violinist\u2019s terrier in a scarf against reason, the wall at the centre with a new small chalk drawing of a bicycle too confident for its own tyres, Priya asleep at her desk pretending to be reading a report about bins. They had learned a kind of patience that felt less like waiting and more like a particular way of staying awake. He found a metronome in a second-hand shop that looked like it had told lies to several teachers and sent it to her with a note that said, \u201cFor nights when the radio refuses to behave.\u201d She found a key ring with a small enamel Mallory house on it at a craft fair and posted it without a note because their jokes did not need explaining.\n\nKiki\u2019s follow-up aired lightly and without insult, a rare thing in the country at that moment, and Crawley watched itself not with pride so much as with relief. It featured the car park lighted like a gala and children\u2019s faces blurred of course but readable in their joy, and it dared to include thirty seconds of the tea dance without treating it like a curiosity. Mrs. Croft appeared wearing a hat and talking about movement like sarcastic scripture, and Jean allowed a sentence about libraries that caused three people in the council to sit up straighter. The piece ended on a shot of the beanie painted over the tiara on the wall and the swallow shutters, and the voiceover said something mercifully brief about \u201chome,\u201d and Rowena did not throw things at the screen because nothing had been made thinner for ease of consumption.\n\nThe library\u2019s Saturday experiment thickened into routine, which is to say it started to feel like a thing that had been true for years. Mark ran the sheet with a benevolence that terrifies teenagers, and Eileen took the eleven o\u2019clock slot to teach a boy called Dev how to hem trousers, and a woman called Bev, who insisted on using her name as a rhyme whenever possible, started a once-monthly poetry circle that had no agenda and yet produced lines that made Rowena\u2019s skin decide to become a drum. Priya invented a mending kit for books that had been loved too hard and labelled it like a joke with \u201ctriage,\u201d and the boys who had preferred shelves to people began to turn up with friends who preferred phones until the phones failed to compete with a man reading aloud that sentence from Wind in the Willows about pootling, which is always fatal to battery life.\n\nJean had a day that frightened nobody but herself, a breath that went sideways for longer than it ought, a seat taken with more care than usual, and a doctor's advice that used words like potassium and breath work and made Rowena put the kettle on with violence and watch the steam rise like an answer to a question she hadn\u2019t asked. It passed, as most things do when treated suddenly with attention and a rest and the knowledge that the human body responds to being asked rather than ordered, but it rearranged a week. Rowena found herself suddenly assessing chairs as if they were co-conspirators and moving everything one inch closer to the floor. Jean, who had always resented being fussed over because fuss is an admission of failure she doesn\u2019t subscribe to, allowed fuss within a tiny, well-marshalled zone and turned her attention instead to the problem of men putting spoons in the wrong part of drawers, which she claimed was the beginning of the end of civilisation. They spent an afternoon together in that particular friendship mothers and daughters have when both have decided not to test any walls, and the house felt satisfied because houses like it when people behave like relatives.\n\nOn a day with light so thin it refused to be measured, a letter arrived at the office written in a pen that had big ideas for itself. It came from a school in the next town over where the headteacher used words like initiative so often they had lost dignity, and it said there was a group of girls who had been told very politely that they danced like boys, and they had gone quiet, and would Rowena come and bring silence breakers. The letter was not good at asking, and it was full of the kind of guilt that suggests nobody had actually done anything wrong, and the girls were probably bored to within inches of revolt. Rowena took it to Thursday class, which was in session with Jonah on a Wednesday night video call held up to the group like an improbable relative. She asked the girls if they would like to go to the next town and be accused of being boys, and they found this both insulting and thrilling, as if being mislabelled could be mischief. They practised walking across a room in ways that would terrify anyone who\u2019d ever called something girly as an insult, not because they tried to be masculine, but because they behaved as if their bodies belonged to them like postcode: definite, dull to outsiders, essential. It is not a story with an ending; it is a story with an appointment time and a ride on a bus, and they went, and the other girls looked at them and looked at their own legs and the mirror, and the whole room got more complicated and therefore better.\n\nThe terrier got a coat in the end, red and ridiculous and worn with the dignity only small dogs can pull off when it is raining in sheets instead of individual acts, and the violinist nodded at Rowena the way men nod when they share no information and all of it. Simon got asked by Priya to come to dinner at the house with the mending circle by accident and found himself at a table where sewing and flirting are permitted to meet. He arrived with a salad none of them needed and a joke that had only undergone minimal testing, and he left three hours later with a date that was not called that because he and Priya had agreed no nouns would be used without consent. Lydia sent a photograph of her mother dancing with her scarf while their kettle breathed and wrote, \u201cThis will have to do for now,\u201d and Rowena wrote back a photograph of a stack of \u201cseason of opportunity\u201d flyers from Jonah\u2019s theatre being used as coasters at the Mallory tea dance and captioned it, \u201cThis will have to do always.\u201d\n\nOn an afternoon when the town smelt of leaf mould and intent, the solicitor came by without drama to sign something that would make the house officially belong to the Trust in the way it had already emotionally itched to. He brought a fountain pen with a nib like a dagger and a cake that suggested he had learned office politics, and he tried the front-room floor with his shoe as people do when they consider whether a house can take more laughter than it is used to. \u201cShe\u2019d be pleased,\u201d he said without any more context, because grief and inheritance make you comfortable with incomplete sentences. Rowena wrote her name in the spot where names stop being signatures and become responsibility, and felt nothing theatrically awful, only the small rearrangement inside that happened whenever she agreed to be late for her own comfort in order to be on time for somebody else.\n\nWhen it snowed, which it always promises and rarely delivers and then over-delivers the one time you told a child not to expect it, Crawley wore its mistakes well. The buses came when they could and were forgiven. The centre became a place where wet feet were allowed and lined the entrance like a tiny art installation. The library\u2019s radiators sang a little and then worked as hard as they were able. The Mallory house hedges held their own festival of geometry. The tea dance was moved to the afternoon because everyone agreed, without consulting any rules, that darkness is not a partner you need for that particular tradition. Jonah sent a message from a stage door with a photograph of snow that had tried to be a metaphor and failed, and a picture of a bow tie that had been tied by someone other than a mirror. The Thursday class turned into a dance in boots on the park\u2019s bandstand because dancers will dance and teenagers will do anything for a photograph that involves breath you can see. Jean watched it all from the window like a person who has learned to calibrate warmth in her own bones, and when Rowena came in, full of the particular hurt that wet socks deliver, she said, \u201cThe kettle is a religion today,\u201d and put it on in a way that made steam seem like a miracle that had agreed to be domesticated.\n\nThe night the snow refused to be romantic and became dangerous, a girl from the Thursday class called because she had been told to and she always did what she was told until she learned a better way. Her mother had been delayed on a bus that had got it into its head to rest in a verge, and her little brother had decided he was not ready to be brave without adult supervision, and could someone sit on a sofa and look at him until the house remembered how to behave. Rowena went with her Sunday calm and her Thursday energy, and she sat on their sofa under a crocheted blanket that had opinions, and she read a book about a mouse who stole a grain of rice and made a friend of a bird, and the boy\u2019s breathing agreed to return to its timetable. When the mother arrived with her hands like small furnaces and apologies, Rowena took her own coat and her own courage and turned them into a photograph in her head labelled, \u201cwhy we do this,\u201d which she would never show at a presentation because real things with small faces do not belong on slides.\n\nOn a morning when the kettle and the sky were in amicable pale agreement, Jonah came back on a day off with the sheepishness of a man who wanted to be heroic about timing and had been beaten by trains. He had a bruise on his wrist he called theatrical and a grin that had not learned to behave in the face of news. He said his grandmother had gone very quiet after the first week of the run and then had begun to speak with great force about the morality of curtain calls. He ate toast with jam like a person who had not been fed backstage food in too many days and told Rowena about a boy in the cast who had never been to a library and had stood in one in Soho as if expecting someone to charge him rent. They walked to the park and did a tiny turn on the bridge where nobody watched them because they were not fifteen and not famous, and later they stood at the Mallory house window and waved at Eileen, who was teaching a woman called Teresa how to thread a needle without invoking a saint.\n\nThey did not decide anything about the shape of themselves because they had learned that decisions made on Tuesdays are less honest than those made on ordinary weather. He kissed her just once in a room that had a trestle table and bunting and the vague smell of furniture polish, and it felt like the kind of sentence you can finish in your own time. Priya walked in with a carrier bag of oranges and did not roll her eyes because she is kinder than that; she put the oranges down and said, \u201cYou will both need vitamin C for whatever you are getting yourselves into,\u201d and went to deal with a man who had brought a violin to the mending circle on the misunderstanding that all broken things accepted glue.\n\nBy the end of the year the car park lights were old news, which is another way of saying they had succeeded. The library had a rota for Saturdays that did not collapse when people went on holiday or broke toes on furniture or fell in love. The Mallory house roof stopped trying to be a commentary and accepted being a roof. The violinist acquired a new piece that had no name and therefore was called after a biscuit, and the terrier allowed its red coat to be washed without going to war. Lydia appeared on a radio show and said no twice politely and yes once carefully and was praised by a woman who sounded like she had only learned to praise recently. Mark turned up at the office with a suit he had borrowed from an uncle and a question about applying for a job that would have him run a youth theatre in a town Rowena had only ever visited for petrol and a child\u2019s temper tantrum, and they wrote the application together in a way that would have made his English teacher sigh with pleasure and pride.\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Eve, which in Crawley is family and pub and fireworks and a refusal to be ashamed of loving the smell of chips at midnight, the community centre held an event that was part vigil, part dance, part stubbornness. They hung last year\u2019s bunting and played a playlist that tried to be nobody\u2019s enemy, and they asked the youth orchestra for a piece that involved everyone, and the cellist cried exactly where you would expect and the drummer did a small solo when nobody was ready and made a mistake and turned it into a joke and then into love. Rowena stood at the back for a while as if she had just arrived in the world and was assessing it with her usual critical generosity. Priya came up beside her with a paper cup and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to make a speech before midnight because the year will think it owes you something,\u201d and Rowena laughed and said she had used all her speeches up and could only dance.\n\nThey danced at midnight without counting, which for a person like Rowena counts as a sin and therefore felt like a gift. She turned once on lino that had seen a generation of chairs, and she did it without apology to her ankle, which accepted the invitation like an old friend who had been waiting for the phone to ring. The year didn\u2019t sneeze at her or hit her on the back of the head; it let her step in without ceremony, and she made one of those private, ridiculous promises to herself that involved kettles and benches and a respect for Thursdays. When she went home, Jean had fallen asleep with the radio on because news insists even at the edge of years, and Rowena turned it off and kissed her mother\u2019s hair, which smelled like the kind of shampoo stubborn women choose and then never change. Outside, Crawley did its best with fireworks on a budget and made a noise that was not metropolitan and not embarrassed, and inside, Rowena put her hand flat on the kitchen table as if testing if it would hold, and it did. She breathed in three and out three and allowed herself a wicked, precise wish for the year: that nothing spectacular happen and everything important continue.\n\nJanuary does not keep promises; it merely provides a cold room and a chair and then looks at you to see what you do. In that room Rowena sat with Priya and made the lists that would govern the months ahead, and she wrote down names that had become verbs: Eileen to teach, Jonah to call, Lydia to say no, Mark to send a text at silly hours with a question dressed as an apology, Jean to schedule gently with a doctor who had learned the art of telling bad news with good eyebrows. The kettle did its theatre. The town tried. The door stuck. The roof held. The music in the Mallory house was, through some trick of wood and habit, still playing even when nobody touched the keys. They went on, which is not a dismissive sentence; it is the kind of sentence a person saves for times when they need to remind themselves that insistence is not always the same as noise.",

                              "content": "The morning Rowena Leigh decided to be late for everything, the town had decided to be early. The buses came too soon, the postie knocked at nine instead of ten, and the gulls had already made off with half the bread meant for the ducks in Memorial Gardens. The church bells practised and then seemed to lose interest midway, pealing into an embarrassed hush that matched the colour of the clouds. Crawley was like that: concrete and kind, proud and awkward, not one thing or the other. Rowena loved it precisely for that.\n\nShe waited under the yew by the war memorial, a paper cup of tea warming her hands, watching an old man with a terrier try to negotiate a bin bag into a reluctant bin. A violinist set up by the railings and played a slow waltz to nobody and everybody. The sky had the pale look of a kettle just before it boils. Her phone buzzed again and she ignored it, because her finely honed instinct for emergency had told her none of these calls were bleeding out onto a pavement. They were meetings and numbers. Things that could be done in an hour, after she fed the ducks.\n\nA young lad sat down on the opposite bench and tried to pretend he hadn\u2019t recognised her. He was taller than last year, voice deeper, hair even carefully ragged. \u201cHey, Ms Leigh,\u201d he said, finally giving up the pretence and leaning forward, elbows on his knees. \u201cYou didn\u2019t come to the presentation. I wanted to\u2014 I mean they said I ought to say thank you properly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare Ms Leigh me, Mark. That\u2019s for school and courtrooms.\u201d She crossed the path and handed him half a sandwich wrapped in greaseproof paper. \u201cAnd you did the work. The bursary\u2019s a bit of scaffolding. You climbed.\u201d\n\nHe looked at the sandwich like it might be ceremonial. \u201cHam?\u201d\n\n\u201cTomato and cheese. No ham. You\u2019re the one who gave me a lecture about processed meat and nitrates.\u201d\n\nHe laughed. \u201cI went back to bacon, actually. Uni\u2019ll do that to a person.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this you telling me it\u2019s all been wasted? That you\u2019re dropping out to become a meat influencer on the internet?\u201d\n\nHe shook his head, swallowing too fast. \u201cSecond year\u2019s harder. But\u2026 I\u2019m going to stick it out. I like it there. That library. And there\u2019s this theatre on campus\u2014never thought I\u2019d say that but yeah.\u201d He looked down, then up again, the shy comes and goes. \u201cMy mum\u2019s not sleeping. Says she misses the washing. The noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll pass. People miss the work of love, that\u2019s all. And they get used to holding it differently.\u201d She sat beside him and they watched the violinist build the waltz into something that tugged at the ribs. The terrier succeeded with the bin bag, emerging triumphant. After the sandwich was gone, Mark wiped his hands on his jeans. \u201cYou\u2019ll come to the open day? For the community centre. You paid the money, so you get to cut the ribbon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come and not cut any ribbons,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll hold the ribbon if the mayor insists on cutting things. And I\u2019ll nick a cup of tea if they\u2019re giving them away.\u201d\n\nHe told her about a director who wore the same scarf every day and a lad who\u2019d joined the Afro-Caribbean society despite being from Chichester and pale as a ghost. He told her his mother had started watching dance videos on her phone and called her to narrate them, breathless. What are those moves, son. They got names? The violinist\u2019s bow found a little ache in the morning, and without deciding to, Rowena stood and let the music turn her bones into a metronome. A step to the left, a sweep, just a mutter of a turn. It was nothing. It was everything.\n\n\u201cYou dance?\u201d Mark asked, mock astonishment. \u201cWho knew.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo-one,\u201d she said, sitting back down. \u201cThat\u2019s the trick.\u201d\n\nBy the time she made it to the office above the bakery on the High Street, the phones were sulking in their cradle and the smell of cinnamon had become an argument you couldn\u2019t win. The door stuck, as always. She loved that it stuck. The Leigh Trust had tried fancy spaces with polished floors and potted palms, and they had wilted on Rowena like poor gold bracelets. Here, with its peeling paint and the constant rumble of ovens below, the money went out the door within minutes of arriving. That soothed her.\n\n\u201cFinally,\u201d said Priya, without looking up. \u201cYour inbox is full and then some. And I\u2019ve already told them yes about the playground, so you can\u2019t swoop in and play the generous patron. Also, your dentist called. Twice.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy teeth are perfect. The rest of me is falling apart, but my teeth are\u2026well. They exist.\u201d She hung her coat on the back of the door and kissed the air beside Priya\u2019s cheek, the ritual done briskly. Priya had been with her eight years. She could smell when a grant application was lying. She could carry three cups of coffee and a laptop up the stairs without spilling a drop. She had a laugh that made other laughs sprout.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a man coming at eleven about the youth orchestra,\u201d Priya said, flipping through her notebook. \u201cHe says they need instruments, not just reeds, which is a very interesting way to ask for trumpets.\"\n\n\u201cAnd flutes,\u201d Rowena said. \u201cI know a flautist who makes old ones sing again. She\u2019ll have a cupboard full of orphans looking for young lungs.\u201d She smiled at the bakery smell and then at the clock. \u201cRight. Tell me the worst thing first.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe worst thing is also the best thing,\u201d Priya said. \u201cWhich is your brand, really. Do you want to sit for this? You\u2019re not going to sit, I can tell. Ok\u2014channel five, Sunday nights, low stakes but surprisingly moving. The South Downs Step. They want you.\u201d\n\nRowena blinked. \u201cThey want my money? Or they want me to be the stern judge who wears a lot of sparkly knitwear and says I\u2019m afraid that wasn\u2019t quite it, darling?\u201d\n\nPriya grinned, catlike. \u201cThey want you. You you. On the dancefloor you. I made noises. They made noises back. Apparently they do this every year: they pick a community person who\u2019s known in the region and pair them with a pro. You don\u2019t have to go through the heats. It\u2019s for the final. It\u2019s a whole\u2026they make a montage. You looking at Crawley from Tilgate Park. You in a taxi. You attempt to learn to\u2026spin. You cry a little at something wholesome. Then you dance.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t cry,\u201d Rowena said, and then had to look away. She\u2019d never been asked to be in anything. She was the one who arranged things. Who moved the chairs and counted the raffle tickets and smoothed the sleeves of nervous teenagers. The idea of someone moving a light towards her made her feel faint and foolish and twelve.\n\n\u201cDo you want it?\u201d Priya asked, softer. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to say yes. Say no and I\u2019ll send them a lovely email saying we admire what they do but Miss Leigh is swamped. By good deeds. Up to her eyeballs in good deeds.\u201d\n\nRowena\u2019s hands did something silly. Then her mouth followed. \u201cI want it,\u201d she heard herself say, the sentence landing like a coin in a wishing well. She felt the ripple inward. \u201cThat\u2019s not the sensible answer but it\u2019s the right one. My mother used to say I had itchy feet.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe meant travel, I think,\u201d Priya said.\n\n\u201cShe meant I danced in the kitchen until the sugar fell off the doughnuts,\u201d Rowena said. \u201cCall them back. Say yes. See if they can keep the cameras out of my bathroom.\u201d\n\nPriya picked up her mobile, still grinning. \u201cWe\u2019ve set a precedent now. The bathroom is sacred. I\u2019ll tell them you\u2019re allergic to loo roll.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell them I\u2019m allergic to the idea of seeing my profile in high definition.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a very noble nose,\u201d Priya said, dialling. \u201cI have it on good authority.\u201d She waited for the line to connect. \u201cHi, yes, this is Priya from the Leigh Trust. We have an answer. Yes. The good one.\u201d\n\nRowena turned towards the bakery window, where a tray of iced buns glowed like a school art project. Her heart beat too hard. This was ridiculous. She had been in boardrooms with men who\u2019d calloused their smiles. She had been in courtrooms with mothers who had no English, holding their children like burning coal. She had been on slow trains with drunk girls and on fast trains with posh boys and she had never once thought there would be a lens pointed at her to capture some small part of her not for proof or protection, but for delight.\n\nHer phone chimed with a text from an unknown number: Hi Rowena, this is Kiki from The South Downs Step. So thrilled you\u2019re on board! We\u2019ll arrange your pro partner today and get you two in a studio ASAP. Also, we\u2019d love to get some location shots around Crawley, maybe your favourite places? x\n\nPriya caught her expression. \u201cWe are in the bit where your life gets b-roll.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy favourite places,\u201d Rowena murmured, thinking of the foot of the old oak in Tilgate and the grubby side alley where the youth club stored its chairs, and the little bridge over the stream that no-one noticed until they\u2019d lost something under it. \u201cDo they want glamour or true?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe sell them true. Give them glamour as garnish.\u201d\n\nThe man from the youth orchestra came with a binder and a willingness to cry on cue, which she appreciated in others and avoided in herself. He had a list of the children who shared violins and the one trombone that made a noise like an elephant with sinusitis. They gave him money to go buy brass and wood, not reeds. She reminded him to keep receipts and pride. He left with eyes shining.\n\nAt eleven-thirty, Rowena\u2019s dentist called a third time and left a message that used the word urgent and also floss, which seemed contradictory. At twelve-fifteen, the bakery sent up four custard slices that tried to convince her she was twenty-five. At one, Priya waved her phone in the doorway. \u201cPro partner,\u201d she said, stage whisper. \u201cI know you wanted someone shorter than you. Or taller. I can\u2019t remember which.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted someone who doesn\u2019t mind being disappointment adjacent,\u201d Rowena said. She put her pen down. \u201cTell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cJonah Hale. He\u2019s done three seasons. The one with the arms,\u201d Priya said. \u201cHe used to be in a company in Manchester before he did this. Everyone says he\u2019s very kind, which is code for unambiguously hot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need unambiguously hot. I need someone who will not complain when I step on his foot as if I\u2019m trying to kill him with only my heel.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will be brilliant,\u201d Priya said, as if it were a fact like the weather. \u201cThey\u2019ve booked you in at Studio 12 on Church Lane, starting tomorrow morning. Ten o\u2019clock. I\u2019ll pick you up if you like. I\u2019ll bring a broom for you to cling to like a partner when he goes for water.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not cling,\u201d Rowena protested. Then she remembered the way she\u2019d clung to herself since she was a girl and, privately, allowed the sentence to soften. \u201cAll right, a little clinging.\u201d\n\nThat afternoon was lost to the kind of practicalities that made her feel steadied: line items in a spreadsheet, a message to the borough council about lighting in a car park, a short argument with a bricklayer about the dignity of a bench. She signed things without fanfare. She answered two emails from people who assumed the Trust was hers like a handbag and gently told them it belonged to them, in the way a library belongs to everyone. The thought of tomorrow kept slipping in like sunlight at the edge of a door.\n\nShe walked home through Tilgate Park when the day had cooled and the families had evacuated in tides, pushing buggies loaded as if for emigration. Dogs compared lives. She took the long way, along the lake, and tried not to imagine music stepping in time beside her. A man in a fleece tried to get a kite to rise and failed beautifully. She wanted to tell him she understood.\n\nHer mother\u2019s house smelled of the past in a way that wasn\u2019t sad. Jean Leigh had made everything in her life look like thrift and feel like feast. The clock ticked too loud in the hallway and the carpet had a pattern which had outlasted fashion by being stubborn and red. Her mother was sitting with a book in the conservatory when Rowena kissed the top of her head. \u201cYou look restless,\u201d Jean said. \u201cLike your shoes want to leave your feet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done something,\u201d Rowena said, too casually. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI stopped minding on your thirteenth birthday. Didn\u2019t see the point after you dyed your hair blue and jumped off the garage roof into a paddling pool.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat pool broke my spirit and also my tailbone.\u201d She poured two glasses of elderflower and tried to look uninteresting. \u201cI\u2019m going to be on a television programme about dancing. Just for one night. It\u2019s for a good cause. They do a segment on what we do here\u2014the bursary, the club, the food pantry thing at St. Mark\u2019s. And I will dance, and then I will go home and be ordinary again.\u201d\n\nJean\u2019s eyebrows did a slow waltz of their own. \u201cYou could never be ordinary if you tried. Who\u2019s your partner?\u201d\n\n\u201cA man named Jonah with arms,\u201d Rowena said, and they both laughed the way they always laughed when Rowena admitted attraction out loud, like it was a bird that might fly away if you startled it. \u201cI should have told you before I said yes, but you would have told me to say yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would. I might have said it very softly so as not to scare you off.\u201d Jean\u2019s weathered hand patted Rowena\u2019s knee. \u201cI remember that ankle of yours turning when you did a spin on the old lino. You were furious your body had borders.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt still does,\u201d Rowena said, without bitterness. She looked at her mother, at the woman who had waited tables while learning to be a nurse while raising a daughter. \u201cNo advice?\u201d\n\n\u201cWear shoes that tell the truth,\u201d Jean said. \u201cSmile as if you mean it. If you fall, fall like it\u2019s choreography. And don\u2019t let them cut your hair for telly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t touch my hair,\u201d Rowena said, a hand moving to guard the wild wave of it, half silver now. \u201cI\u2019ve become very attached to being unruly.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Being tidy is for cupboards.\u201d\n\nThat night she slept as if someone else had hired the moon to watch over her. She woke at four to a train of thoughts that refused to obey signals: I can\u2019t, what if, yes you can, you\u2019re being ridiculous, you\u2019re almost forty-six, forty-six is not a number that means you must. She got up and made tea. She went back to bed and dreamed of being late to a wedding where she was both bride and aunt and no-one else minded.\n\nThe studio on Church Lane had been a kissing booth for light in some other century. The windows were so tall it felt like standing in a throat, about to sing. There were scuffs along the bottom of the mirrors where generations of shoes had learned to be bewildered. A pot plant in the corner was clearly on the brink of deciding. Two girls in leggings watched their reflections negotiate being human. The receptionist looked at Rowena like she was an aunt who might bring biscuits later. \u201cStudio 2 for you,\u201d she said. \u201cJonah\u2019s on his way, he\u2019s just parking. You can go in and\u2026stretch? Or stand and wonder what you were thinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am superb at wondering what I was thinking,\u201d Rowena said. \u201cI could win a medal in that, if there were medals for it.\u201d She changed into the trousers Priya had insisted were flattering and the top that did not show too much of anything. She left her street shoes by the door and put on the pair she\u2019d bought back when she convinced herself salsa would be her next soft addiction. The leather creaked approval.\n\nJonah came in like a word you\u2019d half forgotten. Built like someone who had carried heavy groceries through snow for a stranger. He had hair that couldn\u2019t decide whether to behave and a smile that made people believe in minor gods. He offered his hand without showing off. \u201cRowena,\u201d he said, as if it were a name he knew from some better story. \u201cI\u2019m Jonah. I am so glad you\u2019re doing this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am too,\u201d she said, and then, in a whisper she hoped didn\u2019t travel, \u201cMost of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can work with most.\u201d He looked her over the way a seamstress looks at a dress. \u201cCan I ask what you love? In dance. Not what you can do, not yet. What music makes your knees think about floating?\u201d\n\nShe thought about kitchens and late night radio, about the solitary ritual of a glass of red and a song that makes washing up a ceremony. \u201cA waltz when nobody\u2019s watching. A tango when every ghost is. I like a little\u2026lean. Why am I telling you this?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you came to let your body tell some truths,\u201d he said, then clapped once. \u201cOk. We have three weeks. In TV time, that is the blink of a thing that blinks. The final is an event: you\u2019ll be with three other couples, a live band, lights that will try to eat you, and judges who will tell you how brave you are. We are going to give them more than brave.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have braved worse,\u201d she said, and the words slipped out before she could tidy them. \u201cNo, scratch that. Don\u2019t put it in the package. We don\u2019t need tragedy. I don\u2019t want pity cheques.\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard you give away money like confetti,\u201d he said, a graceful change of subject. \u201cAnd that you make people think the confetti was theirs all along.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am merely a redirect. I point a river in a better direction,\u201d she said. Then, because she could feel her own pompousness like a rash, she added, \u201cAlso, I am not above weeping in a meeting if it gets a youth orchestra a tuba. Please don\u2019t make me do that in glitter.\u201d\n\nHe grinned. \u201cWe will not weep. We will sweat and laugh and swear a bit. Most of the swearing will happen in your head.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am prepared,\u201d she said, rolling her shoulders. \u201cShow me how to not murder your toes.\u201d\n\nThey started with a frame: the arm under her shoulder blades like a promise and a question. He guided her into the first turn and back, then forward, then into a place where, for three seconds, everything was shade and light, and her feet obeyed her even though they had spent years on more solid jobs. She tripped once and then twice, and apologised only for the second one because she was learning that apologising for gravity was a habit she could kick.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look there,\u201d he said gently, touching his own chest. \u201cLook over my shoulder. As if you can see the door. The one you walk through when you are not doing this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very attached to doors,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI can tell,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cWe\u2019re going to choose music today. Nothing too fast. Something that lets you speak with your shoulders.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we do it in three?\u201d she asked, hopeful. \u201cMy heart counts that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can definitely do it in three,\u201d he said. \u201cIt must be the Crawley in you.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrawley is a waltz town,\u201d she said, with the loyalty that comes from knowing a place did its best with what it had. He had the band\u2019s demos on his phone, and they stood by the window to listen, sharing an earbud like teenagers. She vetoed the obvious songs, the ones that had been on wedding dance floors and in adverts for biscuits. She said no to anything too earnest, too kindly. She chose a piece that had a bit of a smirk, a waltz with grit in it. \u201cThis,\u201d she said, when the strings kicked at the drums.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d Jonah agreed. \u201cWe can build an opening that makes them quiet. Then a turn that earns you a small whoop.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoops are not charitable,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can\u2019t be gifted. You either buy them or\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014or you earn them,\u201d he said. \u201cYes. You\u2019re going to earn several.\u201d\n\nThey practised until her lungs whispered stop. He made her sit down and brought her water and a biscuit from his bag, which told her he had been a boy scout or raised by old women. He told her about the first time he\u2019d danced in a school hall that smelled of cabbage. She told him about the first time she\u2019d danced in a doorway to avoid an argument in the kitchen. He told her about a shoulder that had complained for a year. She told him about a knee that spoke fluent weather.\n\nWhen they finished an hour later than scheduled, he walked her to the door like a gentleman in a book. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked, and he wasn\u2019t asking as a politeness.\n\n\u201cI am quietly on fire,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cGood. Keep the flames small today. Stretch in the bath. I\u2019ll text you the videos so you can practise lying down.\u201d\n\nShe stepped into Crawley\u2019s afternoon with the strange feeling that she was both larger and more transparent. It made queues easier. She could see the curled impatience of the woman at the post office and the waist-high despair of a child whose lollipop had detached from its stick. Love looked like someone turning in the queue to let someone else go first. She let two someones go, then went home where her legs protested in organised and disorganised ways.\n\nThe next morning folded into the one after, the one after. Practise. Grant applications. A visit to the youth club where someone had left a pair of tap shoes on a chair like a joke. A message from Kiki with a schedule of when to sit on benches and stare into middle distance while a drone tried not to crash into pigeons. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking of the bit by the bandstand?\u201d Kiki said in a voice note that was 30 seconds of fizz. \u201cPeople might come up to you, that\u2019s ok, we\u2019ll roll with it. We\u2019ll ask them to sign releases if their hello makes the final cut.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want to film me telling the two old men that they can\u2019t bring beer into the play area?\u201d Rowena replied. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply cinematic. Sometimes they wobble when they realise they\u2019re seventy.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually yes?\u201d Kiki said. \u201cWe want the real. We don\u2019t want the posh version of the real.\u201d\n\nOn the fourth day, the producers had her walk up her own front steps and open her front door as if it were both the first and last time. She took them to meet Jean, who had put on one of her good cardigans and also her normal face. Kiki fell a little in love with her, as everyone did. \u201cDo you ever dance, Jean?\u201d Kiki asked.\n\n\u201cOnce a year in my kitchen on my birthday,\u201d Jean said. \u201cTo a song only I am allowed to sing along to. The singing is terrible.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we\u2014\u201d Kiki began, then stopped. \u201cNo. That\u2019s your moment. We\u2019ll leave you that.\u201d\n\nTheir cameraman, a man named Simon with a scar that bent when he smiled, loved Crawley like a cousin. He made the A23 look poetic. He filmed the roundabout like it was a carousel. He put his camera down to help an elderly woman push her wheelie walker onto the bus. \u201cUse that,\u201d Rowena said, fond. \u201cPut that in the show. It\u2019s better television than anything I will do with my feet.\u201d\n\nThere was one hiccup when, at Studio 2, a woman in a bright tracksuit introduced herself as a contestant\u2014for a second, Rowena thought the word applied to her, and laughed internally at the newness of it\u2014and told her she was brave. The woman was a radio DJ from Worthing, small and sparky, with two dogs on her Instagram and a tattoo that said Begin. She had been in the heats for weeks, she said, and had lost a toenail to ambition. \u201cIt\u2019s worth it,\u201d she promised. \u201cThey do the spray tan even if you\u2019re pale and have no business resembling a satsuma.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m allergic to dyes,\u201d Rowena lied gently.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell them that,\u201d Kiki whispered, as if it were a secret between spies.\n\nThey had a day where nothing worked. Jonah\u2019s shoulder sulked and so did Rowena\u2019s feet. Her stomach went quiet in that bad way which meant sleep was on strike. She left the studio and instead of going straight home, went to the old school where she\u2019d been taught to sit up straight and dream within reason. The caretaker remembered her mother and her hair. He let her into the hall. The floor had been replaced since the last time, but the cheap curtains remained, a shade of green not known in nature. There was the echo. There was the stage where, fourteen, she had danced a number to a song nobody else liked, and where Lydia March had danced next, all brightness and shine and the kind of confident that needs two chairs. Lydia with the laugh that could hang you up to dry. Lydia who had told Rowena that her arms looked heavy and her heart would never float. Lydia who had done everything first and loud.\n\nIt surprised her that she remembered the exact order of things: Lydia\u2019s backbend, the little tick in the music where Rowena had tripped and then pretended the trip was step and nobody had been fooled. She had not thought of Lydia for months. Years. It felt like thinking of an old minor cruelty, the way you press a bruise to see if it still belongs to you. It did. She stood in the quiet school hall and forgave herself for not forgiving Lydia at fourteen, and then forgave Lydia, too, for the sin of believing the world was a mirror.\n\nOn a Friday, Priya came to the studio with an armful of oranges and a notebook. \u201cYou look taller,\u201d she said to Rowena, meaning it. \u201cDid he pull you out like a pencil?\u201d\n\n\u201cI pulled myself out,\u201d Rowena said, and then, embarrassed by the way that sounded, she added, \u201cHe helped.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got a turn you could serve tea on,\u201d Jonah announced, wiping his neck with a towel. \u201cWe did it three times and nothing broke.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare become unbearable,\u201d Priya said to Rowena, who stood there thinking: I won\u2019t. I can\u2019t. It\u2019s too late to become that. Thank god.\n\nIt was Sunday night and the frost had arrived early for once when Priya\u2019s text arrived, tinny and simple:\n\nHave you seen the press release?\n\nRowena was in the kitchen, examining her knees as if they were new. She did not answer for a beat, then: No. Should I?\n\nIt names the final four plus \u201cspecial.\u201d You, DJ woman, footballer\u2019s wife from Hove, that actor from the hospital show\u2026and\n\nShe stood very still, as if movement would summon something, like a ghost or a cat. And?\n\nLydia March.\n\nIt was not that the name itself had magic. It was the way the years between now and then collapsed obediently, like folding chairs after a meeting. The floor under her shifted. Her phone chose that moment to ping with a new message: a link to the announcement, glittering and noisy, with photos that were all teeth and light and heat. Lydia\u2019s was there, a face that had learned to be photogenic from angles and from other people, a smile that said what it had always said: watch me.\n\nRowena put the phone on the counter. She made a cup of tea slowly, as if tea were a solution to all physics. The spoon clinked in the cup and her hand shook once, not enough to spill. Jean came in and stood opposite, reading her daughter\u2019s face the way farmers read the sky.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not the tooth people.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a name,\u201d Rowena said. \u201cIt\u2019s school in a dress. Do you remember Lydia?\u201d\n\nJean\u2019s mouth did the thing it did when she wasn\u2019t going to say anything uncharitable but very much wanted to. \u201cI remember her mother more. The woman who made every school concert a referendum on her daughter\u2019s future fame.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s on the show,\u201d Rowena said. \u201cShe\u2019s in the final. We\u2019re going to share a floor.\u201d\n\nJean sat down. \u201cDo you want to quit?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Rowena said, immediately, and then had to laugh at herself. \u201cI want to win, like a child. Like a silly ridiculous greedy child. And I want to never have to stand by her in a hallway listening to her say something that makes my spine feel\u2026less.\u201d\n\n\u201cWanting to win is not a sin,\u201d Jean said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a feeling. What you do with it is the trick.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could put it into my feet,\u201d Rowena said, and heard Jonah\u2019s voice in her head: into your shoulders, into the whole of you. \u201cI could dance without turning the dance into a weapon.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019re getting clever,\u201d Jean said, smiling, then got up to flick the kettle on again because, in their house, boiling water was as close to a religion as they got. \u201cSit with the feeling. It\u2019s like a cat. If you chase it, it\u2019ll scratch. Let it come to you.\u201d\n\nRowena sat. The room had its old lessons in it. She could smell the Sunday roast ghost. She could hear the tiny hum of the fridge. She would have to write to Kiki and say, I know you like drama, but you can\u2019t have me in a corner making a face every time Lydia speaks. She would have to say to Jonah, don\u2019t change anything because of this. Do not give me extra spin. I will not be a cartoon of triumph.\n\nHer phone lit again, messages flowing in from people who now wanted to hear her say that name, to tell them it meant nothing, that she was beyond it, water off, ducks, backs. Priya\u2019s last text said: breathe. Then: imagine her face when you take a bow.\n\nRowena lay in bed later and pictured that bow. She pictured the work that came before it. She pictured falling, once, and then getting up and folding that into her steps as if it were planned. She pictured Mark at home watching with his mother, who would forget to breathe for the length of the song. She pictured the youth orchestra with shiny trumpets. She pictured a small girl at a kitchen table deciding her arms belonged to her. Lydia\u2019s face floated in the room like an old picture. It faded when she refused to feed it.\n\nThe days that followed were not dramatic. They were full of small almosts. Her body was a calendar of learnings. She bought plasters for parts of herself she never thought could blister. She kept a diary for the first time in years because she needed somewhere to put words that weren\u2019t polite. On a Tuesday, she wrote: today I wanted to throw a chair through a window because my feet refused to believe in the concept of three. On a Wednesday: don\u2019t buy leggings that promise to be encouraging. They lied. On a Thursday: spoke to Lydia in the corridor. She looked at my shoes and told me she had a pair like that when she was ten. I told her I had a pair like this now because I took as long as I liked.\n\nJonah noticed when her moods leaned. He did not fix them. He adjusted the light. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to prove sixteen-year-old you wrong,\u201d he said, when she mistimed a turn and swore in delight just to change the air. \u201cYou only have to show forty-six-year-old you what she already knows.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat she can do two things at once. She can be kind and want to nail this,\u201d he said. \u201cShe can make a face when she sees a name on a list and then decide the face isn\u2019t the final word.\u201d\n\nThey practised with the band. The conductor was built like a lamppost and flirted with everyone. The cellist cried at the bit where the violas rise and then pretend they didn\u2019t. Rowena took the stage not dressed, not lit, just chalk marks and a sense of size. She stood in the wing and imagined the audience like a lake. She breathed. In three. Out three.\n\nThe final would be at the Brighton Dome, which meant they would take Crawley there and make it ours for a night. The producers sent through more schedules and more digital forms where she was asked her height, her weight, and if she had ever broken a bone. She wrote yes and no in the wrong places and had to call Kiki to confess. \u201cI can fill in forms,\u201d she said. \u201cI swear. I\u2019ve filled in a thousand. Today I forgot my own shoe size.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt happens,\u201d Kiki said, voice like a hand on a shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take care of you. You take care of the floor.\u201d\n\nOn the day they tried costumes, the stylist\u2014a man named Andy who could make a string look like cashmere\u2014wanted to put her in pink. \u201cYou\u2019ve got strong skin,\u201d he said. \u201cPink is brave on strong skin.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo to pink,\u201d she said. \u201cI grew up next to a butcher\u2019s. Pink is\u2026meat. I\u2019ll wear blue.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. \u201cBlue it is. With a secret thing that will make the judges lean in. I haven\u2019t decided what yet. Maybe buttons.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t make it a hat,\u201d she begged.\n\n\u201cIt will not be a hat,\u201d he promised, solemn. \u201cI will never make a woman like you wear a hat she did not ask for. We have standards.\u201d\n\nThey brought in Lydia\u2019s couple to practise before them. It wasn\u2019t malice. It was scheduling. But it turned the room into a place with two temperatures. Rowena stood in the corridor and watched. Lydia was as good as she\u2019d assumed. Better. She was precise and bright and carried her body like a correct answer. Her partner did not have Jonah\u2019s steadiness but made up for it with dazzle. The song they used was fast and more fast and then something like a jump. They made the studio feel like it belonged to them.\n\nRowena did not look away. She let the old ache come and sit on her lap and then climb down and curl up by the door. When Lydia came off, they brushed. Lydia\u2019s perfume was new, but the eyes were the same. \u201cYou look\u2026well,\u201d Lydia said, which was the oldest way of not saying anything.\n\n\u201cYou too,\u201d Rowena said. \u201cCongratulations on making it to the final.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t luck,\u201d Lydia said, without irony.\n\n\u201cNothing ever is,\u201d Rowena replied, and went into Studio 2 with her feet loud in her shoes. Jonah raised an eyebrow at her, the kind that asks a dozen questions at once, then crossed the room to take her hands.\n\nThe first turn was wrong. The second was honest. The third started where her shoulder met his palm and ended where the music\u2019s joke lived. The waltz made room. It felt, for the first time, less like trying and more like remembering. Outside, the sky was the same paling kettle. Inside, they made their water boil.",

                              "content": "The night settled over Crawley as if it had been trained, a slow draw of dimness that left the bakery\u2019s windows warm and the buses lit like aquariums. Rowena floated home with the odd sensation that the pavements had grown a size. In bed she lined up her aches and assigned them names like you would to plants on a windowsill. The left calf was Determination. The right shoulder was Pride With Questions. The ankle she had once ruined for a summer was Caution Wearing a Flirt\u2019s Dress. She woke to drumming rain and a text from Kiki with the kind of cheer that can only be achieved by a woman who lives on spreadsheets and hope: Today: Memorial Gardens for b-roll + quick vox pops. Wear something weather-proof but not sad. x\n\nBy ten she was under the same yew by the war memorial, the rain having decided on a compromise drizzle. Simon had a rain cover over the camera that made it look like he was coaxing a shy animal. Kiki had a baseball cap, lipstick the colour of cherries, and a clipboard whose elastic bands had migrated south. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get you feeding ducks because I\u2019m not an idiot,\u201d she said, handing Rowena a bag of torn bread that had clearly been purchased for this exact purpose. \u201cAnd the violin man\u2019s here again, which is either luck or fate or the BBC spying on us. Do you mind? We\u2019ll give him twenty quid and an angelic glow.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll buy his terrier a coat,\u201d Rowena said, and turned to see the old man from days before negotiating a fresh bin liner. The terrier looked at Simon\u2019s lens with suspicion, then decided it had bigger existential questions. People slowed when they recognised her, which still made her want to turn to check if someone more deserving was behind her. They used her name, and then some didn\u2019t and called her love, and she loved them for that small democracy. A teenager with a skateboard asked if she was famous yet and if she\u2019d still come to Youth Night on Thursdays. \u201cI\u2019m allergic to Thursdays,\u201d she said solemnly. \u201cI only go because pickle crisps are cheaper then.\u201d\n\nKiki guided her into a scene with the practiced kindness of a woman who has coaxed stories out of shy mechanics and angry vicars. \u201cLook past the bridge,\u201d she said, and Simon lowered himself into a crouch that revealed a surprising grace for a man who wore boots. \u201cTalk about what you think when you\u2019re here.\u201d Rowena resisted the urge to say mostly I think about bread mould. She spoke instead about remembering names, about the second bench on the left where a boy had told her he could hear his father\u2019s voice if he sat very still, about the way the water did you the favour of pretending to be interesting so you could stop pretending to be strong.\n\nAn older woman with a shopping trolley approached to ask if she should say something into the camera because she had a grandson who made beats and sometimes needed money for software. They signed a waiver on the damp lid of a bin. The violinist tried a tune that was almost a reel and almost a lullaby and Rowena\u2019s head acknowledged the rhythm without her permission. \u201cGive me thirty seconds of tiny dance,\u201d Kiki whispered. \u201cKitchen size.\u201d Rowena did not want to. She did it anyway. It felt like letting a cat out of a carrier after too long in a car, each step cautious and then inevitable, small enough not to tempt fate, real enough to satisfy it.\n\nJonah texted a photograph of his shoes next to a kettle. The caption said: Hydration. Also, I am stretching. Please imagine my virtue. She sent him the violinist, half a blur of bow, and the terrier with bread in a guilty mouth. He sent back a line that felt like the beginning of something and the continuation of something else: Remember to keep your breath where your heart can reach it.\n\nAt Studio 2 that afternoon, a notice had been taped to the door in marker pen: No fake tan in the toilets. It read like poetry and made everyone behave. Jonah had rigged a line of tape across the floor to teach her floorcraft, which he insisted was not dark magic but could look like it if you were watching from a balcony. \u201cThe trick,\u201d he said, \u201cis to know that you own any space your feet have already promised to. You can\u2019t buy it once you\u2019re in it. You purchase it three steps ahead with intent.\u201d\n\n\u201cProperty law is much more fun when you put it like that,\u201d she said, attempting a drift that did not look like a broom trying to decide. \u201cWhat happens when someone else has promised the same space?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you speak more loudly with your waist,\u201d he said, the kind of sentence he could not have uttered in a past that involved paperwork. \u201cAnd if they still don\u2019t listen, you smile as if you meant to be almost-murdered and you make a new plan on the spot.\u201d He told her a story about a gala where a footballer had blundered into their line and he had had to turn a waltz into a polite fight without losing the three. She confessed she had once written an entire grant application in the foyer of the council offices because they had \u201cclosed for staff training\u201d and she had bet the day on time. He laughed, pleased to find grit under her polish and polish under her grit.\n\nThey broke early so she could go to the community centre site on the edge of town. The mayor had insisted on two ribbons because the local florist owed her a favour and had gone wild with satin. Priya had prepped the speeches to within an inch of their lives and then folded them into her bag with the confident nihilism of someone who knew the words were for the council\u2019s website and the real ceremony was the first scuff on the new floor. Mark arrived with his mother and a scarf that had been knitted by someone with a vendetta against subtlety. The youth orchestra arrayed themselves with the solemnity of children who have been told they are participating in civic life. The tuba gleamed like a planet. The trombone did not sound sick anymore. A girl with hair that refused to sit stood with a flute that had clearly been loved back to functionality, and when she put it to her lip Rowena felt the sound go through her where blood should.\n\nThe mayor, a woman with a laugh like a taxi door slamming, pretended to slice the ribbon while Rowena held it and did not get misty-eyed, and then cut for real with scissors that had once been destined for cardboard. \u201cYou\u2019re meant to speak,\u201d Priya hissed, and Rowena did, keeping it to the length of a bus stop shelter. She thanked the builders and the boys who had lugged chairs and the mums who had tolerated late paint. She thanked that feeling in town that was not pride or pity but the middle bit that holds everything up. She did not say Lydia\u2019s name, though she felt it the way you feel a bead in your shoe.\n\nAfterwards, someone put on music because people always put on music, and there was a not-quite-dance on the new floor, the kind that happens when strangers think they might as well let their bodies do unambitious good. Mark\u2019s mother pulled Rowena into a spin that defied health and safety and told her she was too thin or too something and to eat, for god\u2019s sake. Priya caught her eye over paper cups of fizzy drink and gave her a look that translated easily: You are allowed to enjoy this. Please do.\n\nLydia sent a message that night, the tone arranged to appear casual. Saw you at the centre via someone\u2019s Facebook Live. Nice. Remember the St. Anne\u2019s hall? You fell on a scuff and we blamed the caretaker\u2019s polish. x Rowena looked at the small x as if it were a knot in wood. She typed and erased and typed and erased again, then settled on: I remember. The floor is good today. See you at Dome. No kiss. She put the phone face down and dug a spoon into yoghurt like it owed her money.\n\nThe Brighton Dome had the kind of air that forces you to stand up straighter just because you have ancestors. The stage, even without light, pulled on the strings of every old dream of velvet curtains and applause like weather. Andy greeted her with three hangers and an expression that meant he had wrestled with dragons and drag queens and triumphed. \u201cBlue,\u201d he announced, delivering on his promise. \u201cWith a sleeve that thinks it\u2019s coy, and buttons doing the Lord\u2019s work down the back. We\u2019ll thread a ribbon here. If you hate the ribbon, I will personally kick it into the Channel.\u201d\n\nShe did not hate the ribbon. She did not like that the mirrors backstage were honest in a way that could make a saint reconsider. Andy softened the light with a cloth like a magician doing childcare. \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone tell you different,\u201d he murmured as he fussed with the hem. \u201cIf the costume makes sorry for you, burn it. If it makes space for you, wear it.\u201d\n\nThey walked the steps in chalk marks, numbers pressed into the floor where other feet had reasoned before. The band was half there, the trombonist warming, the drummer fidgeting with brushes, the conductor tapping a pencil against his teeth and flirting with the air. Jonah took her to the edge of the stage and had her look out at seats that would soon be filled with lungs and judgement and joy. \u201cThis is yours,\u201d he said softly. \u201cNot possessed. Belonged to for a night.\u201d\n\nHe told her, in a loosening way he had not done before, about the first time he stood on a stage smaller than this in Manchester, with a company that kept its costumes in a closet that used to be a shower. He told her about a night when he exited stage left and met a woman crying by the fire door because she wanted her life to be about something and wasn\u2019t sure it was. He sat with her on the sticky floor until she did not cry anymore and then went back on because that\u2019s what bodies with promises do. He told her about his grandmother who did not say she was proud but who ironed his shirts with a ferocity that communicated the same. She told him, in return, how she had once convinced a business owner who had never danced except drunk to give them money enough for a music teacher by comparing children\u2019s fingers on strings to the first time he started an engine that wasn\u2019t his. \u201cHe said yes because men love engines,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd because he was lonely.\u201d\n\nThey tried the first eight bars with the band and it went wrong in the delightful way that makes musicians alert and dancers defensive. The drummer added a breath they hadn\u2019t accounted for. The strings were brighter than the demo. Jonah adjusted without making it an announcement. \u201cWe\u2019ll build you an inhale here,\u201d he said, and the conductor nodded as if he had just been invited to share dessert. Rowena found the new small pause and placed her foot in it like a truth.\n\nHer ankle muttered later, a sullen throbbing that made stairs more interesting than they were designed to be. Jean found the old tub of Epsom salts and the even older towel that had dried every hurt in the house. \u201cSit,\u201d her mother ordered, and sat too because caring was a verb that doubled. \u201cTell me the worst idea you\u2019ve had today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought about saying to the cameras that I don\u2019t mind if I lose,\u201d Rowena said, amused and alarmed by her own bravado. \u201cWhich is the kind of sentence only a liar would say on the day before.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell them you mind,\u201d Jean said. \u201cBut don\u2019t let them make your minding the story. Win or lose are small words compared to dance and give.\u201d\n\nKiki left a voice note that sounded like a friend trying not to be a producer. \u201cWe\u2019re doing sit-downs in the morning. It\u2019ll be five minutes. I\u2019m not going to ask you about your childhood unless you volunteer it, scout\u2019s honour. I do want you to tell me, on record, what you want this to do for Crawley. And yes, I know you hate being made into a saint. I promise I\u2019m allergic to halos.\u201d\n\nIn the morning they put her in a chair in a side room strung with fairy lights because someone had a budget for kindness. Simon crouched the way he always did. Kiki asked questions that had teeth but wore lipstick. Rowena said that half the point was the Trust and the dust and the quiet ways money can make a chair a dignity instead of a surface. She said the other half was selfish and radiant, that a woman gets to become new things after forty without needing permission slips. She watched herself in the unseen lens and felt surprisingly like herself.\n\nShe saw Lydia in the corridor afterwards, in a robe that made her look like a weather system. They traded the sort of conversation people have when there are microphones within reach and history without an address. Lydia\u2019s smile was wider than warm. \u201cBreak a leg,\u201d she said, the universal benediction delivered with a fizz she could not parse. Rowena smiled back with all the teeth she owned and said, \u201cNever,\u201d because her legs had spent the night in salt.\n\nBack at the studio, there was too much energy and not enough air. The DJ from Worthing was practicing a samba like a skipping rope. The actor from the hospital show had a face that had argued with tabloids and won by ignoring them. The footballer\u2019s wife from Hove had the focus of someone who had survived stadiums. Jonah wrapped Rowena into frame to remind her that names were merely labels on jars and it was the contents that made supper. They ran the middle section where she always forgot to breathe and suddenly she did not forget and the music walked with her. He did not say good. He said again, which was better.\n\nThe night stole in as if embarrassed to be seen. She went with Priya to the bandstand to watch teenagers attempt to film a music video with a phone on a stack of textbooks. Priya, who had once abhorred paper cuts and now wore them like credentials, slipped an arm through hers. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to become a person who talks about how it\u2019s not about them while their face is on a six-foot poster outside the Tesco,\u201d she said lightly, and Rowena laughed because she had already composed that speech in her head and burnt it. \u201cGood,\u201d Priya said. \u201cBecause I have a speech ready in case you do and it involves the phrase \u2018get over yourself\u2019 tattooed on the wind.\u201d\n\nThey bought chips and ate them standing, wind doing its therapy. A man who had been young when the Beatles were, and was now merely himself, asked what time the show would be on. \u201cMy granddaughter wants to vote but she\u2019s abroad and I told her that\u2019s cheating,\u201d he confided. \u201cI\u2019ll clap extra for her.\u201d Rowena thanked him with a seriousness that felt appropriate to chips in the cold. She walked home with salt on her fingers and a calm that pooled. In the kitchen she put on the radio and found a waltz where she did not expect one, a late-night DJ with a heart that wanted to make strangers soft. She let her shoulder remember the rule Jonah had given it: speak in long sentences. Her reflection in the window was tilted by all the small lights of town and she did not try to correct it.\n\nThe last day before the final arrived with the kind of sunlight British people applaud as if it had paid for the privilege. Andy adjusted the sleeve and told her she looked like a woman who could ask for what she wanted and get it. Jonah arrived with a book of crossword puzzles to calm his hands. Kiki delivered an agenda that was part festival, part invasion. There would be photographers. There would be small microphones that could betray you if you swallowed. There would be folk singing backstage or something like it because musicians get bored and cure themselves. There would be, above all, waiting.\n\nThey had a stumble-through that was wonderful in the way that musicals of the eighties had taught her the word meant: everything goes wrong where you can fix it. She did not fix one thing because Jonah told her not to, and then his eyes told her to trust it, and she did. She saw Lydia run a sequence from backstage, a ribbon of speed and glitter, and she let it live in the corner of her eye without feeding it. She visited the band as if they were holy, thanking them for the way they carried weight with a bow. The conductor asked if she would mind if the strings leaned a .5 hair more into the joke on bar twenty-three because it made him feel like life had meaning, and she told him to lean as if he were trying to eavesdrop on his own joy.\n\nJean arrived with a bag that looked like it might contain a roast chicken and in fact had safety pins, plasters, fruit pastilles, and a card with a saint on it despite not believing in saints. \u201cI found this in a charity shop when you were twelve,\u201d she said, handing over the card with a shrug as if she were offering a kitchen timer. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if it was your saint but the woman on the front has hair that refuses instruction, so it felt right. Stick it in your bag and find it again when you\u2019re eighty.\u201d\n\nThey sat in the corner of a backstage lounge with carpets that had seen secrets. \u201cTell me what you\u2019ll do if you forget what comes next,\u201d Jean said, like an oral exam that had nothing to do with terror.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll walk,\u201d Rowena said, surprising herself with the clarity of it. \u201cI\u2019ll walk in time until my bones tell me they\u2019re ready again. I\u2019ll look over his shoulder as if there\u2019s a door I meant to find.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Jean said. \u201cAnd if you aren\u2019t fine, you\u2019ll be interesting, which is better.\u201d She put her old hand over Rowena\u2019s, brown with age and a life of disinfectant and flour. \u201cI wish your father were here to see you,\u201d she added, and it was not a sad sentence. It was a sentence like a weather report: true, and carrying no demands.\n\nIn the hour before curtain they sewed her into the dress with friendly precision. Andy\u2019s assistant, a rangy young person with eyeliner like intention, told her she had the posture of an honest person and she almost cried at the stupidity of how that kind of comment can go straight into your marrow. Jonah came to find her when it was time to put shoes on. He did not make speeches. He just tied his own laces with a concentration that made her want to pat his head like a child. \u201cOne favour,\u201d he said, after the laces were tied. \u201cIf at any point you feel your mind run ahead of your feet, think of the bench by the lake and put your heel down like you\u2019re claiming it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf at any point I don\u2019t,\u201d she replied, \u201cremind me to breathe in threes.\u201d\n\nThe corridor to the wings smelled of lacquer and ambition. The actor from the hospital show did a silly handshake with his partner and then did it again, because ritual requires repetition. The footballer\u2019s wife kissed a small charm on her wrist. The DJ from Worthing took a photo of everyone\u2019s shoes lined up like they were at school and promised to send it to them later, which she did immediately. Lydia, already luminous, stood with her hands on her hips and rolled her neck like a cat before a fight that was not a fight. She caught Rowena\u2019s eye and for a brief second there was neither past nor future, only two women about to do something that would make them visible. \u201cSee you on the other side,\u201d Lydia said, and this time it landed in the dignified place.\n\nWhen the lights came up on the first number and the audience made the kind of noise that has a roof to it, Rowena felt something unclasp under her ribs. It was not fear. It was the idea that she had to be either giver or receiver and could not be both. It blessed her and left. She stood in the wing and counted quietly to herself until it lined up with the band\u2019s intent, until her foot and the drummer\u2019s brush were cousins. The stage manager, a woman with headphones like jewellery, squeezed her arm at the right moment and sent her into the dark the way you send a small boat into a lake you have loved since you were young and stupid and brave.\n\nThey took their places as the strings took their breath, and when the first bar came it was like stepping into a kitchen you did not know you owned but had always kept the key to in your pocket. Jonah\u2019s palm at her back was not instruction; it was translation. The turn that had scandalised her body for days lived and breathed as if it were a creature that had wandered out of the woods and consented to be seen. She looked over his shoulder as if there were a door and found not only the door but the corridor and the air beyond it. The smirk in the waltz did its work and somewhere, not far, she heard someone make a noise they did not know they would make. She did not forget. When she felt herself consider forgetting, she placed her heel as if a bench were at stake and the bench complied.\n\nThe middle section where the room had always tilted decided to behave under lights because sometimes pressure is a kind of discipline that liberates. The judges\u2019 table blurred into glow. The edges of the stage spoke to her feet and told them where not to go. At the small pause they had built with the band, Jonah\u2019s eyes asked her a question she understood and answered with her shoulder. The ribbon on her dress remembered its purpose and did not rebel. The floor did not present a scuff in the name of narrative symmetry because life does not always deliver metaphors that easily. She made three turns in a row that felt like sentences with commas and no full stops, which was exactly how she wanted her day to be read.\n\nThey ended, as one must, with a bow that was a conversation with an audience she would never meet in kitchens and shops but would meet in the way they carried her afterward in their talk. The applause was not charity. She knew charity applause. She had organised charity applause. This was a sound like rain finally remembering. She took it into her bones and into the places where youth and age meet and decide to share a sandwich. They left the stage backwards because that is how you keep time in the modern world, and in the wing she let the air enter her lungs like she had just been allowed to land.\n\nShe did not cry, not yet. That came later, when Simon with his bent scar came to take a photo and she saw in his lens not a woman being brave but a woman being exactly the size of herself. Jonah said something unflashy and perfect, and Priya barreled into her like a cousin and said too many words in the right order, and Jean, when she arrived at her shoulder somehow through rules she had not been told about, kissed her cheek and said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t fall,\u201d as if that were the least of it and also the headline.\n\nThere were scores, of course. Numbers delivered with wit and a minor insult wrapped in velvet. The panel did their thing: one pirouette of praise, one comment about arms that in another life would have made her small but now just made her want to feed them. Somewhere in there Lydia danced in a way that made time respect itself, and Rowena watched and applauded hard because good is good and envy is a petty thief that steals your socks and leaves you barefoot rather than barefoot and dancing. The DJ woman did her samba and looked like a canary released. The actor charmed the lights and the lights consented to be charmed. The footballer\u2019s wife demonstrated that focus is a kind of philanthropy.\n\nBackstage, Lydia found her again, and this time there was sweat and relief on both faces. \u201cYou were\u2014\u201d Lydia began, searching for a word that did not come with glitter. \u201cYou were yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo were you,\u201d Rowena said, and neither of them knew whether they were complimenting or admitting. It did not matter. It was a sentence that had waited thirty years to be said in that exact tone.\n\nKiki, incandescent with triumph and exhaustion, hugged her in a way that made their microphones threaten to kiss. \u201cWe got it,\u201d she said into her hair. \u201cWe got you, the real you. And Crawley looked like a postcard I want to send to my own mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cSend her the one with the terrier,\u201d Rowena said. \u201cHe is the soul of our town. Also the bit where the boy with the skateboard asked me if I was famous yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlready in the cut,\u201d Kiki promised. \u201cHe says \u2018yet\u2019 like a prayer.\u201d She squeezed Rowena\u2019s hand hard and then let go because letting go is part of the job.\n\nThe rest of the night did what nights do when they have been kindly used. It allowed for eatings. It made room for calls from people who had watched with children on their knees and dogs on their feet. It delivered a text from Mark that was all caps and punctuation crimes and better for it. It let the youth orchestra send a photo of their instruments leaning against chairs like tired wedding guests. It let Priya make a joke about the mayor having survived the spray tan in the audience and therefore deserving an MBE for services to the colour orange. It allowed Jean to fall asleep on the sofa with her glasses still on and wake exactly when Rowena needed her to.\n\nRowena walked home long instead of short because nerves leave a residue the body must wash away in motion. The town had changed because light had changed but was fundamentally itself, doing the small serious work of being home for people who hate and love it in equal measure. She stopped by the lake even though the dark had recruited the water for its army. A fox crossed her path and did not apologise. Above, the sky made no comment. She stood there long enough to become hungry, which is how you know you are alive and not a statue gussied up with sequins.\n\nOn her doorstep she found an envelope the colour of butter, the handwriting a slant she recognised from detentions. Inside: a postcard of St. Anne\u2019s hall, cheap and terrible, with a note that said, Okay. You win this one. L. It was not gracious. It was as graceful as Lydia could manage with all her mirrors. Rowena laughed, then, alone and good, the sound blurry and bright in the night. She went inside and wrote Lydia a reply on the back of a flyer for the open day because paper is paper. It said: It wasn\u2019t a fight. But thank you for stepping where you stepped. R.\n\nIn the morning she slept later than any respectable adult should and allowed herself to be late for everything on purpose. The town, contrite or amused, returned to its normal schedule. The buses were late. The postie came when he felt like it. The gulls adhered to no known timetable. She went to the office and the door stuck and she blessed it and made tea in a paper cup and sat at her desk while Priya told her three things in quick succession: that the dentist had called and it might actually be urgent, that the youth orchestra had been offered a spot at the summer fair, and that Channel Five wanted to do a follow-up where they get her to teach the mayor a box step in the bandstand.\n\n\u201cTell them I will only teach the mayor a box step if she agrees to hold her phone as if it is a small animal,\u201d Rowena said. \u201cAnd make the dentist book me in for Wednesday. My teeth exist. They can be examined. I have been examined enough. Let them join the queue.\u201d She looked at the pile of paperwork that had quietly birthed a second pile and felt no despair, only the performance hum that had not left her yet. It had changed flavour. It tasted now like readiness rather than risk.\n\nAt lunch, a girl came in with a form that needed a signature and bravado that needed not to be punctured. She had the shoulders of someone told regularly she took up too much space. Rowena signed the form and then, before the girl could leave, asked if she had somewhere to be at four on Thursdays. The girl blinked. \u201cThere\u2019s a dance thing at the centre,\u201d Rowena said lightly. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly chaos disguised as rhythm. You\u2019d be welcome. Bring shoes that don\u2019t apologise.\u201d\n\nThe girl nodded once, the minimal movement that signals a life changing direction. She left, and the bakery below chose that moment to take something out of an oven and bully the entire building. Priya groaned and went to buy survival pastries. Jonah texted a photograph of the sea with a caption that said, My grandmother says well done. She never says that. I am passing it on before it evaporates. Rowena wrote back a photograph of Crawley\u2019s least photogenic roundabout and a caption that said, My mother says I didn\u2019t fall. She always says that. I am passing it on like a family joke.\n\nShe had thought the day after would be a plummet. It was not. It was a step into another beat. Not faster, not slower, just exactly measured with the town\u2019s heart. She filed and phoned and received photos from people who had watched in rooms she knew and in rooms she would never see. She ate a custard slice without dignity. She told Priya she was going to be unreasonable about the LED lights in the car park until the council gave in. She thought of a boy\u2019s elbow in a suit jacket too big for him at a graduation and felt the future knock at the door, polite as anything, persistent as damp.\n\nThat evening, when the sky had the pale look of a kettle again, she took her shoes off like a ceremony and put the blue dress in a garment bag like a story that would be told again only when it made sense. She stood in the middle of her mother\u2019s kitchen in bare feet and danced the bit they had not rehearsed because there is always a bit you don\u2019t rehearse. It was the part where you let the music speak through you without auditioning it first. It was small and entirely ridiculous and suited her very well. Jean watched from the doorway and said nothing and then said everything in the way she put the kettle on without asking. The water boiled like a good joke remembered. They drank their tea. They were not ordinary. They were two women in a house, making a day behave. Outside, Crawley did what it always did, which was try. Inside, Rowena let her bones count to three and then four and then three again, because she had earned the right to change time and live to tell of it.",

                              "content": "Chapter Five\n\nThe week after the Dome, Crawley went back to being itself with a sigh that sounded like buses arriving when you have already walked to the next stop. The posters outside the Tesco survived two days of rain before they curled like leaves, and someone drew a crown on Rowena\u2019s hair in biro which made Priya laugh and made Rowena feel oddly knighted by a child\u2019s boredom. People stopped her and said things like, you looked taller on the telly, love, and didn\u2019t you do well, and my granddaughter says your dress wanted to go to church. She thanked them and meant it, because there are worse fates than being folded into people\u2019s stories in small and friendly ways. She learned that fame in Crawley is a handshake, not a spotlight, and that hurrying never improves a conversation carried out between a bakery and a bus shelter.\n\nShe went to the dentist on Wednesday like a penitent who had promised a saint something foolish. The waiting room had six plants trying their best and a poster about gums that made her want to brush until she had no teeth left. The hygienist offered a smile that had been whitened to the point of theology and told her that she was clenching at night, which sounded like something a person did in a poem, but apparently it cracked enamel and made jawbones sulk. The dentist, a man with forearms that said tennis but eyes that said sudoku, showed her tiny fracture lines in a molar as if they were lines on a palm. \u201cIt\u2019s the body\u2019s way of writing,\u201d he said, surprisingly gentle. \u201cYou\u2019ve been biting your life. Try biting fewer moons for a bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m allergic to moons,\u201d she replied, because cheek had always gotten her through medical conversations, and he laughed and put a slick of something protective in a place nobody would admire. He told her to wear a guard at night. She thought of armour and the delicate indecencies of sleep, and she thought of how she had been clenching since she could remember and how now, perhaps, she could tell her jaw that it could rest because her feet had found other uses for tension. Outside, a collection of schoolchildren were attempting to decide whether the rain was an obstacle or a dare. She stood under the awning and made a small pact with herself to treat her molars like colleagues rather than serfs.\n\nOn Thursday she unlocked the community centre early and stood for a minute in the doorway breathing the smell of varnish and possibility, and then fussed with chairs until fussing had done all it could. The first of the Thursday lot arrived in a trickle: a girl with a bun that refused containment and two boys pretending their trainers were exhausted by fate, a grandmother in a cardigan with a zip and a young mother in boots that had seen a field. Rowena put music on with the casual authority of someone who knows the right kind of volume is half the battle. \u201cIt\u2019s chaos disguised as rhythm,\u201d she told a newcomer who looked wary, and then proved it by setting them to a line of simple steps that became miraculously complicated when hope entered the room.\n\nShe did not talk about the Dome because the room did not need the Dome. She talked about weight and breath and how your body tells the person you\u2019re with how much you trust them by not apologising for physics. When they practised a turn that preferred to be shy, the grandmother muttered that hips had never been honest in her family, and everyone laughed and the turn became easier. Midway through, the doors opened again and Jonah came in holding a bag of resistance bands and a jar of jam that had obviously been given to him on the street by someone over seventy. He slid along the wall with a grin, trying not to be the sun.\n\n\u201cI brought contraband,\u201d he whispered in a voice that was audible to the end of the line, and the boys\u2019 eyebrows went up a fraction in solidarity with anything labelled contraband. He didn\u2019t teach; he assisted. He stood beside the girl with the refusnik bun and made his hand a metronome until her foot trusted the floor. He demonstrated frame with a broom in a way that made the grandmother say, \u201cOh,\u201d as if she had just remembered an old joke. When the young mother confessed she worried her arms looked silly, he told her that arms do not get to be silly when they\u2019ve carried two shopping bags, a child and an argument.\n\nAfter, they sat on the edge of the stage with paper cups of squash, feet hanging like punctuation. Jonah told them about how balance is something you discover in motion and how standing still can be the trickiest step. \u201cYou all look like you\u2019ve got good ankles,\u201d he added, making everyone feel secretly flattered by a body part. Rowena watched him watching people and felt a small thread tug in her. It wasn\u2019t romantic in the way a film would have made it \u2014 no slow zoom, no clarinet \u2014 it was quieter and more stubborn, the feeling of having found a person who would stand beside you in a draught without speaking until you were both ready to.\n\nShe walked out into drizzle with him later, both of them carrying bags, both pretending to ignore the way the weather had decided to become personality. They didn\u2019t talk about what the future did or didn\u2019t hold because neither of them liked to hire the future before it did an interview. He said his grandmother had indeed said \u201cwell done\u201d and had then ruined the purity of it by ironing as if she could improve the compliment with steam. She told him Jean had not washed her hair all weekend in case the success lived in there like a benign parasite. They parted at the corner with a plan so modest it felt invincible: he would come to Crawley for fish and chips and then they would attempt to waltz in a pub garden to jukebox music while pretending to argue about bus routes.\n\nKiki brought her clipboard and a film crew to the bandstand two days later and tried not to look as if she were about to herd cats through velvet rope. The mayor arrived in a coat with buttons advocating for at least six causes and held her phone in both hands like a small mammal awaiting a vet. \u201cI promised I\u2019d hold it like a hedgehog,\u201d she declared, with relish, when Rowena reminded her of the conditions. They attempted a box step to something that wasn\u2019t quite a box step song, which made it better. The mayor loved it when she got the corner right and loved it more when she didn\u2019t and the corner forgave her. Two teenage boys attempted to walk in a straight line past the cameras without contracting any visible joy and failed at the second part. A woman with a pram shouted that she\u2019d seen worse on Strictly and the mayor shouted back that she took that as a compliment.\n\nThey were halfway through when the text arrived about the new centre. Priya\u2019s message was brief and spiky: Paint on east wall. Don\u2019t look until you\u2019ve had tea. Bring kindness. Also bring a cloth. Rowena went anyway and skipped the tea, because curiosity has a louder voice than wisdom when you\u2019ve helped build a wall that is now wearing someone else\u2019s mouth. The words were in spray paint the colour of arrogance, but the hand that had made them wasn\u2019t skilled enough to make cruelty look elegant. It said: PAY TO PLAY, which was both wrong and dull. Beneath, a crude caricature of a woman with a tiara that had more spikes than sense.\n\nTwo lads in school blazers were loitering at a distance with the forced nonchalance of people who have been told to observe but not demonstrate interest. A girl with a backpack was drawing on her thumb with a biro to avoid looking at Rowena. She stood and looked and did nothing for a few breaths because reactions are stories you tell in a hurry that you have to live with. Then she called Priya and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll need paint, the cheap kind, and rollers for small hands. And you know that boy with the chalk art? Bribe him with cake to come and draw like a priest.\u201d Priya said she already had the cake and the boy and a trolley that could take a wall on a date.\n\nThey made an afternoon of it because what else do you do with assaults that are more about being seen than about damage. Mark turned up with a cohort who had only come for the free biscuits and stayed because someone put drum and bass on very quietly and the job suddenly had rhythm. The boy with the chalk art came with a box of colours that had seen worse pavements and drew a river that refused to stay inside any lines anyone had given it. The girl with the backpack watched for a while and then took a brush with the solemnity of a knight handed a sword and painted a bird whose wings did not match and therefore felt true.\n\nWhen the lads in blazers slouched close enough for apologies, Rowena smiled the kind of smile that rescues people from edges and said, \u201cHelp me replace the tiara with a hat that doesn\u2019t shame the head wearing it.\u201d They laughed, relieved, and painted a beanie that made the caricature look like a neighbour who borrows sugar and returns it as cake. A police community support officer wandered by and wisely decided this required no paperwork, only a compliment. Simon arrived without Kiki or a camera because sometimes friends arrive when there is colour, and he fetched tea in cups that burned fingers and stood on a chair to paint a part none of them could reach. Priya kept receipts and pride in equal measure and liked the way the afternoon had decided to be necessary. When they were done, the wall had become a conversation people would want to join, not the last word of a fool\u2019s sentence. Rowena sent a photo to Kiki with a caption that said, we pay with time, we play for keeps.\n\nThat night, while she was soaking the paint out of her knuckles, Lydia sent a message that contained more heart than words. Saw the mural. Good answer. I\u2019m in town Tuesday for radio. Coffee? Station bar, no cameras, I swear on my worst rehearsal skirt. Rowena stared at the request until it lost its power to rearrange her organs and then replied with an hour and a yes and an emoji she did not understand why she had chosen, a small flag she could pretend meant something neutral.\n\nThey met in the kind of cafe that tried to be a bar by keeping the lights down and playing a playlist that assumed people drank red wine at noon. Lydia wore a coat that had opinions and a face that had learned to hold two ideas at once: self-belief and please don\u2019t hurt me. They hugged in the awkward way of women who have practised impressive indifference for so long that their arms have forgotten. They sat. They ordered tea because tea is a truce. The barista had a haircut that required faith in the future and a smile that made tipping inevitable.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come to tell you I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Lydia said first, because she had always preferred to be the person who begins. \u201cThat sounds like theatre, and I think you\u2019re allergic to theatre unless it\u2019s got children and a broken chair in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not allergic,\u201d Rowena said, and then laughed, unspooling a little. \u201cI break out in a rash and I come out in hives and then I bring plasters. Don\u2019t let me take the metaphor somewhere it doesn\u2019t want to go. Go on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came to say I remember being fourteen and cruel, and I have spent years being congratulated for being relentless, and I haven\u2019t decided yet whether those two things are cousins,\u201d Lydia said. \u201cI came to say that when you danced at the Dome I remembered that you existed separate from me. I didn\u2019t know that at fourteen. Nobody tells girls that other girls are not mirrors.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t very\u2026forgiving,\u201d Rowena said, and it felt like placing a coin down on a counter and seeing if it would roll. \u201cI used your face like a fence I could lean on and not fall, and then I resented the fence for existing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour bus got there before mine,\u201d Lydia said, with a wryness that suggested she had rehearsed this line and, finding it useful, kept it. \u201cMy mother\u2019s voice was in my chest so loud I couldn\u2019t hear my own. She has opinions about women who stop and put kettles on. Mine is that kettles are holy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does she make of the final?\u201d Rowena asked, and they both smiled at the safety of a question with an answer that wouldn\u2019t scalp them.\n\n\u201cShe has opinions,\u201d Lydia said again, but softer this time. \u201cShe thinks I should have worn red. She thinks I should have been given a longer bit of camera in my exit. She thinks I should marry someone who can clap in time. She thinks you were \u2018surprising,\u2019 which is her way of complimenting someone she\u2019s already tried to pigeonhole.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could tell her I have an excellent dentist,\u201d Rowena said, and Lydia choked on tea, then lived. They allowed themselves to laugh in that small bar with its earnest lighting and its baked goods that glistened like sin. It wasn\u2019t a reconciliation because there had been no declared war, no ink, no treaties to draft. It was a rearrangement of furniture in a room they had both avoided. They left it better.\n\nAt the door, Lydia paused as if deciding whether to walk back in and change the ending. \u201cIf they ask me to do a Christmas special,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m going to say no. I thought you\u2019d like to know I have learned the word no and I plan to put it where it belongs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can borrow my box of noes,\u201d Rowena replied. \u201cIt\u2019s full. I make more every week. They go well with jam.\u201d They hugged again and it landed, less armour, more bone. Outside, the trains argued with their timetables and people pretended time was solid. Lydia walked towards an appointment with her own voice. Rowena walked towards the trust office and the smell of cinnamon and paperwork.\n\nThe youth orchestra\u2019s first outing as a proper ensemble with brass that didn\u2019t sulk was at the summer fair in a park that insisted on calling itself a field despite being overshadowed by a row of semi-detacheds. A Ferris wheel had been borrowed from somewhere whose name suggested coastal glamour and now squeaked indignantly at a sky that refused to stay blue. The tuba made jokes with its shadow. The trombone refrained from sounding like ill wildlife and instead sounded like a thing agreeing. A boy who had never been allowed to be loud before was asked by the conductor to be very loud indeed at bar twelve, and his face at bar twelve was the kind of face a person tries to write poems about and shouldn\u2019t because you cannot net that fish; you only clap and remember the water.\n\nRowena wore a dress without a cause and shoes that did not scream to be noticed, and she took a paper programme that had been printed at a cost she had negotiated with a man who claimed ink had tripled in price since the Romans. She stood at the side while parents swayed and grandparents became only ears. Jonah found her halfway through a brass arrangement of something that had been born in a disco and smiled in the way that says later, let\u2019s be pleased about this. He held two volcanic polystyrene cups of tea like a juggler and asked her if she wanted a doughnut or an alibi. She took the doughnut because sugar wins fewer wars but fights better.\n\nAfter the fair they followed the river into a pub garden and attempted the plan they had set because there is a dignity to keeping promises even when they seem daft. The jukebox produced a waltz-like thing by accident, and they counted quietly in each other\u2019s proximity while men in shorts did their best not to make eye contact. An elderly couple gazed with the neutral curiosity of people who have seen much and survived most of it. They danced a couple of passes and then stopped because there was nothing to prove and the grass had decided to be ambitious. They sat. He told her about a company he\u2019d been offered work with that would take him away on and off, the kind of proposition that theatre makes like a magician producing a rabbit and then asking for your signature in blood. She told him about a council meeting on lighting where she intended to turn a car park into a ballroom in order to embarrass the budget. They looked at each other not to solve anything but to file new information under the drawer labelled, \u201cTell me when you\u2019re ready to put this somewhere permanent.\u201d\n\nThe first unpleasantness arrived on a Monday the colour of old paperwork and soup. A local paper printed an editorial with the kind of headline that tells you the subeditor learned irony as a second language: \u201cGlitz or Graft? Has the Leigh Trust Lost Its Way?\u201d It was the usual stew of suspicion and budget line misreadings, with an insinuation that she had danced while benches went unbuilt and a cheap shot about cameras that made her jaw test the guard\u2019s usefulness. Priya walked in with three copies because she believed in studying your enemies in hard copy, not on a screen, and told Rowena she was permitted three ways of responding: ignored, politely savage, or danced on. \u201cDancing on it requires a stage and a sequinned shrug,\u201d Priya said, dry. \u201cPolitely savage can be framed and hung over my desk. Ignoring it requires faith.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s starve it,\u201d Rowena said, after the kind of pause that other people might mistake for indecision and Priya knew was caution. \u201cAnd let\u2019s feed the thing it tried to eat. I\u2019m still doing the night walk. I\u2019m still turning the car park into a ballroom. I\u2019m still going to steal the floodlights by calling them safety not spectacle.\u201d\n\nThey printed flyers for the night walk on paper that had ideas above its station and knocked on doors that never opened the first time. They invited the choir from St. Mark\u2019s on the understanding that 7/8 time could go home if it wanted to. They asked Simon to bring a camera only if he left his permission slips in the car. They negotiated with the supermarket whose car park it was as if they were asking to borrow a kitten. The supermarket said yes because they liked the idea of warm goodwill and because someone in the office had watched the show and had a mother who adored Jean\u2019s cardigan.\n\nThe night was colder than necessary, which pleased everyone because then the tea tasted like an outcome. They strung solar fairy lights along the shortest route to the darkest corner and named the corners after people who had refused to be intimidated by bulbs. The violinist came with the terrier and played a reel and then a hymn and then that almost waltz he always played, and people took strides as if strides could be good deeds. The mayor arrived in trainers and held her phone like a hedgehog who had decided the vet was decent. A group of teenagers pretended not to care until the drums of the youth orchestra joined and then they cared very loudly and tried to disguise caring as running, which made everyone happy.\n\nRowena climbed onto a low wall because not all speeches require a mic if you have shoulders that have learned to speak. She said that light is not decoration in a town where children go home from clubs at dusk and nurses walk to work at five. She said that money spent on illumination is money that refuses to be noble and chooses, deliberately, to be useful. She did not mention the newspaper by name because dignity is a harder hobby but worth keeping. She asked people to walk with her in a lap of the car park as if it were a lake and the swans had agreed to be honest for one night. They walked. They applauded lampposts. They applauded each other. The supermarket manager stood near the trolleys and looked like a man who would sign a thing in the morning without asking for three meetings first.\n\nHer phone vibrated with messages from donors and grumps and that rare beast, the donor-grump, while she carried a tray of biscuits like a waitress from a dream. Priya handed her a stack of pledge forms and said, \u201cOne step at a time,\u201d and then took away the stack because she trusted Rowena more when her hands were free. Simon didn\u2019t film the faces of children because he kept his promises, but he did film the way light seats itself on concrete like purpose, and he sent her a short clip later with a caption that said, \u201cYour town looks like it likes itself for once.\u201d\n\nThe day after, council officers wrote in emails with the kind of briskness that pretends to be disapproval and is actually a concession. They found the money in a pocket they\u2019d forgotten and the lights became line items with dates attached. Priya put the dates in a calendar in ink instead of pencil for the first time in months and treated herself to a pastry so complicated it had to be named after a country. Rowena wrote a letter to the paper that wasn\u2019t savage at all; it was patient. She explained how budgets are buckets that are happiest when you hold them steady with both hands. She did not justify. She did not apologise. She thanked the editor for loving the town loudly enough to ask questions in public and invited him to come to the Thursday class to see what public money looks like when it stops being paper and starts being breath.\n\nJonah sent her a message in the middle of the afternoon with a photograph of a studio floor and the scuff marks arranged like constellations. His caption said, \u201cThought you\u2019d like this map.\u201d She wrote back a photograph of the newly painted wall at the centre and the beanie that had replaced the tiara. Her caption said, \u201cWe found north.\u201d He wrote back a joke about compasses. She didn\u2019t reply because she was in a meeting with a man who said synergy four times and meant nothing by it, but later she went to the park and tried walking in time to the traffic and found it possible.\n\nJean had a fall that was small in physics and large in implication. It was a misjudged step in the garden on a day when the grass pretended not to be wet, a slip that ended with a fold rather than a crash, a bruise the colour of eggplant that spread its way into conversation. She didn\u2019t tell Rowena until two days after because her pride has always been a useful liar, and when she did she presented it like an anecdote she had edited for laughs. \u201cI told the hydrangea not to overreact,\u201d she said, dry as a council biscuit, and Rowena kissed the top of her head and counted backwards while checking ankles. They went to see the doctor together and the doctor said the things doctors say about vitamin D and sensible shoes and not pretending the body was made by a company with a lifetime guarantee. Jean sulked and then conceded and then let Rowena put her hair into a plait that made her look more dangerous than fragile.\n\nIt rained three days in a row in a way that felt like discipline. The centre roof held. The youth orchestra practised a piece that contained mischief and sadness and made parents look around as if for tissues and rationalizations. A girl came to the Thursday class who had been told by a PE teacher that her body was for thinking, not doing, and Rowena put a hand just above her elbow and showed her where weight is just an idea. The girl left with a new problem to consider and a schedule that now had Thursdays in it in ink.\n\nA week later, Jonah asked if she would come to Brighton not for a rehearsal or a television anything but for a ceilidh in a room above a pub where the floorboards had learned humility. She said yes because she had said no to a lot of things this year and had discovered that yes could be a garment that didn\u2019t ride up. The band had a caller with a voice like a recipe and arms like a conductor who had been demoted and took it well. They stamped and circled and swung, and it was not elegant but it was holy in that evidence-of-life way. Rowena laughed so hard at one point that a man in a kilt turned to see what he\u2019d done and felt gratified. They went outside to breathe and watched the sea insist on its own clich\u00e9s and then surprise them with a wave so gentle it felt staged. They did not kiss because not kissing can be an event of its own, and because both of them wanted to be adults about desire. They promised dinner where the cutlery would have arguments with the napkins and then went home to their separate beds with hearts that were not empty.\n\nOn a Sunday morning afterwards she met Lydia again, unplanned, in the aisle with the tinned tomatoes. They had both come without armour, hair pretending it had behaved itself. They compared brands as if they were talking about neutral things and then they were neutral things. Lydia mentioned a daytime show that had called and how she was going to say no because she could hear her mother\u2019s voice and also her own. Rowena mentioned a grant for the youth club\u2019s roof repairs that had grown a paragraph overnight because she had realised she was appealing to a panel that had never been fourteen in Crawley. They parted with a joke about sauce and the right kind of basil and neither of them felt thirteen. When she passed the bakery window on the way out, iced buns shone as usual and she felt the town bless her with its ordinary.\n\nIn the evenings, when work was done and nothing was on fire except the three small fires that always are and can be put out with email and carrot cake, Rowena sat with Priya and built the calendar for the months ahead. They wrote down the summer fair where the orchestra would play again and the old men would argue about whether the trestle tables had always been that wobbly. They wrote down the open day two for the centre because one open day had bred expectations like rabbits. They pencilled in time for a holiday that neither of them truly believed she would take and then inked in two days in August when she would turn her phone off and see if the town remained standing, which it would. They left room for Kiki\u2019s follow-up, not because Rowena craved more light but because light had proven itself an employee willing to work overtime if given a fair wage and occasional biscuits.\n\nOne evening, when the sky browned too early and the smell of petrol decided to be melancholy, she walked to the Memorial Gardens again with a bag of bread that was not stale enough and a mind that wanted to rehearse arguments for meetings that would never happen. The violinist was there, of course, because the town loved its characters and tried to return them to their spots each time. He played the almost-waltz and then, instead of finishing, he began something that crawled under the ribs and made a home. The terrier had acquired a scarf against sense. The old man with the bin liner fought a new bin and won with dignity. A teenager practised a skateboard trick that the laws of physics had attempted to outlaw. Rowena watched and let the music tell her bones to stop auditioning for tragedies that would never be staged.\n\nShe danced a little, the size she had promised Kiki and herself she would always leave room for. It wasn\u2019t a rebellion. It was a note to self delivered on time. A woman sitting on the far bench took out her phone and did not film, and Rowena loved her for it in the quiet way you love someone who refuses to make a gift into content. On her way out of the park she saw a poster for the council\u2019s consultation on public art and smiled because one of the questions would be about graffiti and she had paint under her nails that would never come out, not because she was sloppy but because some colours decide you belong to them.\n\nShe went home and found Jean applying balm to her bruise with the concentration of a person varnishing their best table, and she told her about light and tomatoes and walls that had become sentences. Jean listened and then took her hand and turned it over the way you do when you are checking for splinters. \u201cYou look longer,\u201d she said, which was not about height and not about pride and not about hair. \u201cAre you less cross with the world or more capable of carrying the crossness?\u201d Rowena thought about it while the kettle tried to race the weather. \u201cI think I figured out you don\u2019t have to choose between being a giver and being seen,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I thought you did. And I\u2019ve been very dramatic about it for months like a woman in a gown on a staircase.\u201d\n\n\u201cDramatic is just another word for honest when the audience is wrong,\u201d Jean said. \u201cDrink your tea before it thinks about being work.\u201d\n\nThe days continued, as they are contractually obliged to, and Rowena kept doing the things that had always been hers with a new economy of fear. Lydia sent a picture of her mother dancing in a kitchen wearing socks and admitted she had not asked for permission. Jonah sent a picture of a bus ticket with smudged ink and asked, absurdly, if she thought smudges had souls. Priya sent a spreadsheet with conditional formatting that looked almost festive and then sent, less cheerfully, the news that the council was considering repurposing the little library branch in Gossops Green and calling it \u201credistribution,\u201d which meant murder. Rowena put on her coat and sharpened her kindest voice because this, more than dancing, had always been the bit she was built for.\n\nAt the meeting, which was held in a room designed by a person with strong opinions about beige, she used her waltz shoulders to stand taller than the opposition and she used her shop-floor vocabulary to make sure the people who could never afford to say the word \u201cimpact\u201d out loud were accounted for. She asked the deputy something that sounded gentle and left a bruise. She reminded them that a library is a place where children go to meet adults who are not related to them and behave anyway. She mentioned the youth orchestra\u2019s sheet music and the girls in Thursday class who had been seen reading before, but perhaps not lovingly. When they tried to tell her about budgets, she said buckets, and when they said centralised, she said walked to and warm. She didn\u2019t win that night because real things rarely are won at seven-thirty by someone with good hair and a clipboard. She started something that had the decency to take time.\n\nOn a night that had the pale look of a kettle again \u2014 late summer wears that colour as if it had a right to \u2014 she took the blue dress out of its garment bag to air it and found that it still smelled faintly of powder and effort. She touched the ribbon like it held a word she had forgotten. She didn\u2019t try it on because clothes have memories that can make you either stupid or brave, and she wanted to be neither on a Tuesday. She hung it on the back of the bedroom door and let it be a thing that had happened and didn\u2019t have to argue its case.\n\nShe took her shoes off like a ceremony and stood in the kitchen with her feet on the square of lino where the old house kept its luck. Jean came in and said something about swans and heating bills that wasn\u2019t an argument unless you wanted it to be, and Rowena stepped into the small bit they hadn\u2019t rehearsed, the dance between the kettle\u2019s click and the pour. It was ridiculous and decent, which is really the honest middle of life. She counted to three and then four and then three again, because time is a toy if you\u2019re gentle with it. She turned very slightly to the left, and the doughnuts on the counter did not shed any sugar, and somewhere the violinist tuned his bow and the terrier dreamed of bread, and Crawley did what it always did, which was make a day behave.",

The buses wore ochre like a uniform. The bakery\u2019s windows fogged as if they were trying to remember a name. Rowena stood in line behind a man buying a single sausage roll and a woman buying enough iced buns to start a political movement, and she read the new notice blu-tacked to the post office door about \u201credistribution of cultural assets\u201d with the kind of politeness reserved for rude relatives. The library consultation had harvested euphemisms like a bumper crop. We will rationalise access, it said, as if reading were a train and timetables solved everything. She bought a loaf that was more crust than crumb because it made toasting feel like work and tucked it under her arm like a document she meant to argue with.\n\nBack upstairs, the door stuck with its usual piety. Priya was at her desk with three mugs, one of which was a threat to national stability, and an envelope the shade of old cream. \u201cThere\u2019s a letter that wants to change your week,\u201d she said, sliding it across the desk with a finger as if it might bite. \u201cHand-delivered by a man in a tweed cap who smelt of camphor and entirely understood the concept of gravitas.\u201d\n\nThe paper inside had weight. It had a crest that looked like a bird reconsidering flight. Mrs. Frances Mallory, who had come to every jumble sale for thirty years with a bag of immaculate napkins and a face that did not apologise for wanting what she wanted, had died at home in a chair that had a patina of secrets, and had left her house to the Leigh Trust. There were conditions. The back garden was to remain a garden, not paved for cars. The front room was to be used once a month for a tea dance, \u201cin memory of my Henry who trod lightly, even on my toes.\u201d The cats were to be rehomed with \u201cwomen of good character and the correct cardigan,\u201d and there was a sentence about the piano that was both specific and tender: it must be tuned by hand, not by app. There was also, tucked in like a worried thought, a modest sum to keep the roof from forming opinions about the weather.\n\nPriya read over her shoulder, lips moving silently at the phrase \u201cwomen of good character.\u201d \u201cMrs. Mallory,\u201d she said, with a breath that wasn\u2019t quite a laugh, \u201chas posthumously made you an events manager with birdsong. This is either an absolute gift or a beautiful trap.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a house,\u201d Rowena said, as if she could return it like a dress with the tags on. \u201cHouses argue. They need gutters and men with ladders who never turn up and neighbours who lounge at their windows like judges. We are not good at ownership. We are good at moving money like air.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer solicitor\u2019s note suggests she thought you were good at holding what needed holding,\u201d Priya said, turning the page to the clause about hedge heights. \u201cAnd I hate to tell you, but I\u2019ve already fallen in love with the idea of a tea dance named after a dead man who was obviously adored. Imagine the old men dusting off their waistcoats. Imagine the youth orchestra pretending to be Deco. Imagine Jonah doing a box step without irony in a room with a piano whose lid has opinions.\u201d\n\nRowena put her head in her hands and then took it out again because hiding had never been her skill. \u201cWe need a board decision,\u201d she said, practical returning like a tide. \u201cWe need to check the roof and the boiler and whether Mrs. Mallory was a woman who liked having three spare keys because if she wasn\u2019t, we are looking at locksmiths at ungodly hours. We need to find cardiganed women who can tolerate cats with old habits.\u201d\n\n\u201cDone, done, and the WI knows everything there is to know about cats and cardigans,\u201d Priya said, ticking off items in a notebook which had not yet failed to manifest what it wrote. \u201cBoard on Monday? I\u2019ll bring biscuits that tell people they are capable. And I will casually ask Simon whether he knows someone who can persuade a hedge to stop aspiring to be a tree.\u201d\n\nBefore biscuits and boards and hedges, there was the library. The consultation session was to be held in the big room at the council offices with the acoustics of an apology. Rowena had decided she would not arrive late, and of course Crawley decided to be early by producing a bus that came on time and thus upset her schedule. In the foyer stood a display of flower arrangements that were making a brave case for chrysanthemums. Kiki hovered with a clipboard and a smile that said she had sworn not to film but could not promise not to organise. \u201cWe\u2019ll do a read-in,\u201d she murmured, as if saying it quietly could keep it from becoming a headline. \u201cAfter. If they announce a nonsense. Rugs, lamps, normal voices. No placards. We\u2019ll sit and outlast them.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring thermoses. Bring sweater-wearing children,\u201d Rowena said. \u201cBring a man with a book on plumbing to confuse them.\u201d She had Jean with her because Jean did not do theatrics and the sight of her in a cardigan that could have doubled as a moral stance changed the temperature of rooms. They took seats near a radiator that hissed as if it had secrets it needed to tell.\n\nThe deputy leader tried to speak softly. He had the face of a man who had forgotten how to enjoy pie. He said things about budgets that were buckets, and Rowena watched the faces around her for the moment when numbers cease to be numbers and become a story about whether you matter. A mother with two toddlers on her lap asked if the centralised library would move closer to the bus stop because she had arms not wings. An old man who had learned to read at fifty-two because he had decided shame could go to hell said he liked the smell of Gossops Green\u2019s carpets, and that he didn\u2019t want to lose the only place in a three-bus radius where nobody tried to sell him anything. Priya, when her turn came, drew shapes in the air with her hand as if access had geometry. She talked about the Thursday girl who had been told her body was for thinking and had been ambushed by books that suggested otherwise. Rowena spoke like a person trying to land a small plane in weather. She did not plead. She named things: faces, routes walked, chairs moulded to backs that had done long days. \u201cIf you make a library into a theory,\u201d she said, \u201cyou will have no stories to put on your posters at election time.\u201d\n\nAfter, they did the read-in. It is a wonder how quickly a room can become a living room if people bring their own cushions and a willingness to behave as if tea helps. Someone had thought to bring fairy lights. Someone had the good sense to bring a plugboard that would pass any inspection short of an inquisition. The youth orchestra\u2019s flautist played something that wasn\u2019t quite a song and wasn\u2019t quite a sigh. The boy who made beats read out the packaging of a cereal box in a tone that made it sound like Shakespeare, and the room applauded as if he had delivered a sonnet. Jean read a recipe as if it were scripture. Lydia arrived quietly, wearing a hat that dared anyone to mention it, and sat on the floor and read from a book of poems in a voice that remembered it had once been small. Kiki had not brought a camera and Simon kept his hands in his pockets in the exact posture of a man who understands devotions.\n\nJonah came and didn\u2019t take up space with anything except his knees and the grin he gives children. When a child with a runny nose climbed into his lap as if humans were part of the furniture, he adjusted his body the way tall men learn to. He caught Rowena\u2019s eye over the small head and for a second there was no council, no bucket, no buckets within buckets; there was just the moment when someone else\u2019s child decides your lap is the best place for hearing about worlds that aren\u2019t on fire. They read until the radiators stopped hissing and any councillors still in the building understood at a level they didn\u2019t know they had that this was a fight they could not win without looking like people who did not like babies. The deputy leader came out at the end, hatless and humbled by the presence of a hundred pairs of shoes in an administrative foyer, and said that no decisions would be taken that evening. It was both cowardice and grace. It was enough.\n\nThe Mallory house smelled like lavender and furniture polish and bread that had once been made with more patience than yeast. The hedge was, indeed, ambitious. The cats were three sisters called Persephone, Mint, and June, who regarded Rowena with the thin contempt of beings who expect canned tuna on a schedule. The front room had wallpaper printed with discreet roses that had weathered years of Christmas cards blu-tacked to their stems. The piano sat under a lace runner like a dowager. The solicitor, a man who tried not to appear charmed and failed, handed over keys that had the ceremonial weight of a minor coronation. \u201cShe believed you would make of this something un-sad,\u201d he said, then checked his watch as if he had somewhere less implausible to be.\n\nThe board had opinions. Colin, who wore shirts like statements and believed assets to be a verb, wanted to sell and turn houses into bread. A woman named Dawn, whose grandmother had been a charwoman and whose daughter was an archivist, wanted to keep the house and the hedge and the tea dances and perhaps move in and make jam. Priya did a graph in her head, then translated it. \u201cWe could keep it on a trial,\u201d she said. \u201cThree months. We hold one tea dance, a book club with biscuits, and a Tuesday mending circle. If it becomes a mouth we cannot feed, we sell with conditions and use the proceeds to throw chairs at problems. If it becomes a heart, we let it beat.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if we make it both,\u201d Jean said, from the corner, having come along with the air of a woman who could calm cats and trustees with the same sentence. \u201cA house that pays for the chairs. Charge a small nothing for tea. Ask men who believe in engines to sponsor the piano. Sell jam at the door in summer. A house can make its own bread if you let it.\u201d The board, which had learned to trust Jean\u2019s kitchen logic more than any consultant\u2019s proposal, nodded. They took a vote that was less a vote than a sigh of relief. The house would breathe.\n\nThe first tea dance landed on a Saturday when the weather couldn\u2019t be bothered to pick a mood. Andy appeared with bunting because he had bunting for every eventuality and because he loved old wood with a fidelity that made the piano preen. Jonah pressed his hands to keys and made them answer like old friends who still remember your weekend name. He taught simple turns with the authority of a man who had not been paid to be authoritative but had earned it anyway. The WI arrived with cakes that had no business involving that much cream. Men who had once worn suits to work wore them again and discovered the mothballs had not eaten dignity. The youth orchestra sent a quartet who could manage \u201cMoon River\u201d and an irrelevant but welcome tango; Jonah smuggled in a waltz that made the floor remember being new.\n\nRowena moved through it all as if she were arranging stars. She found chairs for bad knees. She found the right kind of silence for the widow who had come because she had promised herself she would and then regretted it until Jonah took her hand for a turn that required only fingers and a memory of shoulders. She made sure the piano had a photograph of Mrs. Mallory and her Henry propped on it so that no one named a room after them without knowing their faces. She danced exactly twice. Once with Jean, who had worn sensible shoes for a fight and then decided to wear them for joy, and once with Jonah, where they did a box step with intentional incompetence that made the children laugh and the old men declare them worth feeding. There was no footage. There was a woman with a sketchbook who caught them in lines and shade and said she would bring the drawing next week because goodness required time to dry.\n\nIt stormed the night the electricians were meant to begin the car park lights, a tantrum of weather that made bin lids into cymbals and repeatedly asked the town if it had finished with its umbrellas. Power lines sulked. The community centre was asked by the universe to be a lighthouse and obliged. Priya sent a text that read \u201cwarm hub?\u201d and when Rowena arrived with kettles and extension leads and biscuits that were mainly apology and sugar, the hall was already full of people who had decided their houses were too quiet when the plugs stopped behaving. Jonah turned up with a duffle that contained blankets and a thermos he swore could heat soup by glaring. Simon brought candles but then didn\u2019t light them because a firefighter who happened to be there did a talk about safety in the tone of a man who had seen curtains misbehave. The youth orchestra, minus sodden brass, came with violins and a drum that didn\u2019t need the grid, and they made a sound that felt like bread smelled.\n\nThey did not dance because the floor was a place for people to put the smallness of their worry, but later, when the noise was down to a hum and the air had softened from damp to human, Jonah put on the radio on his phone and found a waltz hiding in static. They stood near the noticeboard with its complicated fliers and did the smallest version their bodies knew, knees barely saying yes. It felt like mending. It felt like the moral opposite of triumph. Jean watched from a chair with a throw over her knees and smiled the smile she reserved for the moment a stubborn jar finally opened.\n\nIn the morning, the town had the hangover of a place that had had opinions about thunder. The lights in the car park got done in a hurry as if contrition were a budget line. The library sent an email that used the word \u201creconsideration,\u201d which is not sorry but next door to it, and invited Rowena to a meeting \u201cto discuss community-led supplementary hours,\u201d which is politician for come save this with cake. She told Priya to look out the rota and the chalkboard and to find pens that made tired people feel competent. Mark offered to man a Saturday shift provided he could read plays aloud in a ridiculous voice for children, and Rowena said that ridiculous voices are how you win wars. The skateboard boy volunteered to reshelve on the condition that he didn\u2019t have to talk to anyone, and then spoke to everyone and reminded them to sign the sheet.\n\nKiki came to film the lights for her follow-up, and she did it like a friend, not a thief. She watched as the floodlit corners filled with teenagers who could now pretend to be moody safely. She shot the exact way the light fell on an old pair of shoes and a child\u2019s scooter because detail persuades more than declarations. She put Jean on camera and asked her one question and let the silence afterwards be the answer. She did not ask for a sob. She caught a laugh.\n\nJonah sat at Rowena\u2019s kitchen table on a Wednesday wearing a jumper that had ambitions and a face that was trying to be sensible. He had vacillated for a week. He had written a pros and cons list and then burned it because lists are deceivers. The company in London had sent an email that used the delightful phrase \u201cseason of opportunity,\u201d which Rowena had vowed never to deploy. \u201cThey want me for six months,\u201d he said, leaning his cheek into his hand like a boy who has just admitted breaking a window. \u201cIt\u2019s not a tour. It\u2019s a run. It\u2019s not gone-gone, more away-then-back, with no guarantees except the guarantee of sore feet.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want it?\u201d she asked, and she did not say we. She made no shape with her face that would push him. She buttered toast like a person who had committed to buttering toast well.\n\n\u201cSome of me,\u201d he said, honest as bread. \u201cThe bit of me that still thinks of rooms where people argue about what art is and then dance anyway. The bit of me that wants to be a room like that for other people. The bit of me that likes floors that have witnessed. I don\u2019t want to be away from here enough to let here shrink.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere won\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cHere has elbows.\u201d She poured tea with a concentration that could have auditioned for the Royal Conservatoire. \u201cTake it. Or don\u2019t. But don\u2019t not take it because of me. Don\u2019t take it because of me. I am not a season. I am a postcode. Come back to it. Or tell me where to send parcels to when you stop eating anything other than actors\u2019 canteen soup.\u201d\n\nHe laughed, relief messing his hair. \u201cI\u2019ll come back,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are very persuasive when you pretend you aren\u2019t trying.\u201d He reached across the table and covered her hand with his in a way that had no spectacle in it and therefore contained everything. \u201cCome see it when we get to the bit where cheap tickets go to friends,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ll do a little bow in the direction of your seat so you can tell me afterwards if it looked like an apology.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t bow like an apology. Bow like a bus,\u201d she said, because nonsense can hold emotion without letting it leak. \u201cAnd go see your grandmother and tell her the ironing can stop now because the shirts are frightened.\u201d\n\nThey did the first Saturday at the library with cake and chaos in equal measure. Children sat cross-legged with the discipline of explorers. The mother with arms not wings came in and read under the warm lamp and forgot her phone on purpose. The deputy leader brought his daughter and hummed in a way he would pretend he hadn\u2019t later. The boys who preferred shelves to people reshelved and spoke in grunts and then full sentences when someone asked them about a series they loved. Rowena ran the till and answered questions and pointed teenagers to books that would not sneer at them. Priya worked the rota like a bus timetable. Jean took the arm of a man who could not quite manage steps and put him in a chair with a view of the noticeboard where all the desperate and hopeful things are pinned. Lydia read again and did not expect to be applauded but was.\n\nThe newspaper printed something that tried to be sniffy and turned, at the last paragraph, into praise by accident. The letters page contained a missive on lined paper from a woman who signed herself only as A Reader and who hoped the people in charge had noticed that sometimes leadership looks like putting a kettle on and arranging chairs in a circle. The editor ran it because even editors sometimes want their mothers to be proud. Priya cut it out and stuck it on the office wall with tape that had outlasted expectations.\n\nWhen the painters came to the Mallory house to make the front room less tired and more itself, the boy with the chalk art asked if he could paint the shutters with something Mrs. Mallory would have liked. Rowena asked him what that might be and he said, without flourish, \u201cBirds that aren\u2019t in cages,\u201d and she wrote the sentence down in the margin of a grant application as if it were a commandment. He painted swallows that seemed to be coming home from a very long day. People stopped when they passed and felt the little lift a good line can give you. Mrs. Mallory\u2019s cats, rehomed with three cardiganed women who had opinions about trifle and politics, visited for a week as if making sure the house would cope.\n\nRowena went to see Mark\u2019s student production in a black box theatre that had started life as a storage facility for costumes and now did its best to play at being art. His director wore the same scarf every day as promised and had sharp shoulders that made him look constantly in motion. The play was about debt and dance and databases and, against all odds, made sense. Mark played a man who tried not to be kind because the world had told him kindness was soft, and then discovered softness can pull you out of a burning car because it keeps you whole. After the curtain call, during which three mothers clapped as if they were trying to convince the building to stay upright, Mark cried in the friendly way boys cry when they have been brave in public and are permitted the aftershock. \u201cMy mum filmed it vertical by accident,\u201d he said helplessly delighted. \u201cI told her it\u2019s a crime. She told me she birthed me. We agreed to disagree.\u201d\n\nOn the walk back to the station she told him the library would need a Saturday stage manager and that she had thought of him because he understood chairs and feelings. He grinned and said yes before she finished asking because he has learned that yes is often a hinge rather than a wall. On the train she watched the dark go by and felt that particular satisfaction of having sat in a chair designed for someone else and clapped with a hand that had held other people\u2019s forms all day.\n\nLydia texted that she had been offered a Christmas special that would involve sequins and novelty and a Santa with more charisma than wisdom. She sent the message from a train that smelled of crisps and copper coins. \u201cI said no,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019m learning the word and putting it in sentences. I told my mother. She said, \u2018How will people see you?\u2019 I said, \u2018In Tesco, Ma. By the tomatoes.\u2019\u201d Rowena wrote back a picture of the Mallory house bunting with a caption about light and hedges and groundedness and then put her phone down and let herself laugh.\n\nThe company in London released publicity shots with Jonah in them, and Priya printed one out and stuck it on the noticeboard next to the letters page and a flyer for a jumble sale at St. Mark\u2019s. The photograph tried to make him into a person with angles sharp enough to bend light, and he let it fail. In his eyes was the exact lack of apology Rowena had fallen in love with somewhere between stringing fairy lights and buying extra bin liners. She took the train one Saturday, the one that insists on being late when you have planned to be early, and stood at the back of a theatre that used to be a cinema and watched him carry a story that had been badly written in its first draft and redeemed by bodies doing what bodies can do when they have been asked nicely. He bowed like a bus, and she pretended it had nothing to do with her and then privately accepted it like a biscuit.\n\nOn the way home, a small fight with a gull for chips she was not even currently eating taught her that humility comes in feathers. She arrived back to find a note pushed under the office door in copperplate that made her think of school registers. \u201cPlease could someone teach me to dance,\u201d it said. \u201cI am seventy-three. No past. No fuss. Tuesdays are best.\u201d The signature was simply Eileen. She took the note home and put it under a magnet shaped like a teapot and decided that Tuesday was, in fact, best. She would call Eileen and tell her to bring shoes that told the truth.\n\nThe library vote came up on a Monday with weather that had wandered in from another county. The council went through a dozen items that mattered less while the room dipped in and out of attention. When they finally reached the bit with the ache in it, the deputy leader spoke first and did not perform contrition but did perform sense. They would keep the branch. Hours would be trimmed but not savaged. Saturday would happen if the community could guarantee bodies and kettles. They would repaint. They would listen when people told them that a child had cried when told that the books would move across town and become harder to hold. It was not a victory. It was a place to stand and see if the ground stayed.\n\nAfter, in the square that tries its best with pigeons and benches that have opinions about teenagers, somebody started to sing a song that did not have a chorus you could remember and everyone hummed anyway. Rowena bought two cones of chips and handed one to Priya, who accepted it like an award and then spilled curry sauce on her shoe. Simon took a photograph without being a photographer and sent it later with no caption because he had finally learned restraint. Jean linked her arm through Rowena\u2019s and said, \u201cYour shoulders look less argumentative,\u201d which was her way of telling her daughter she looked happy without alarming her.\n\nThey launched the Tuesday mending circle at the Mallory house with a table that had seen better days and enough thread to rig a sail. Eileen came, hair in a no-nonsense bun, and learned a slow turn as if it were a recipe she had been denied. The boy with the chalk art sat on the doorstep and drew the street in reverse. The cats visited their old house and inspected everyone\u2019s knitting and nodded without smiling. Jonah sent a picture of his dressing room with the note, \u201cThe mirror does not tell the truth. I\u2019m writing on a napkin. Post soon.\u201d Lydia wrote to say her mother had, without warning, danced in the kitchen to a song about crumbs. Kiki passed through like weather, warmed everyone and left behind a neat stack of consent forms and three croissants.\n\nOn an evening with light like rinsed glass, Rowena and Jonah met at a pub where the jukebox had a sense of humour and the countryside was an allegation. They argued amiably about bus routes because intimacy is sometimes practice for disagreement. He told her about a boy in his company who had never eaten soup that touched bread and had cried when he found out what was allowed. She told him about a councillor who had never sat in a library on a Saturday and had cried when he saw who did. They danced a bit on the way out because the jukebox could be persuaded to play something like a waltz if you were patient and bribed it with coins. A woman smoking near the bins clapped and told them not to get married because it ruined your knees, and they thanked her gravely because unsolicited advice deserves dignity.\n\nLate, in her kitchen, when the kettle did its reliable theatre, Rowena took the blue dress down from its hook to check the ribbon hadn\u2019t sulked in its sleep, and then put it back because there is power in not retrying a thing you don\u2019t need to prove. She stood where the lino remembers dances and moved a little in bare feet without agenda. Outside, the town practised being itself against the window. Inside, she put a hand flat on the counter like a promise and let her bones count to three, then four, then three again, because time, once tamed, sometimes comes when called. The night didn\u2019t require her. It did not ask her to bargain. It allowed her to make a day behave without watching, which is perhaps the finest compliment a place can give.",

Rowena walked from the bus stop with a loaf under her arm and a plan in her head that had more arrows than boxes, and the town offered up its usual chorus of the almost and the nearly: a lorry threatening to become a traffic story, a gull considering a bag of crisps above its station, a woman in a luminous jacket telling a man with a ladder that no, she did not need an estimate, she needed a miracle. At the office the door stuck and she blessed it because friction is proof of life, and Priya lifted her face from a spreadsheet with the satisfaction of someone who had won an argument with a column and would forget to tell anyone about it. She had an envelope with corners that remembered other corners, and she held it two fingers' width above the desk as if to give it chance to be light.\n\nIt had the Mallory solicitor\u2019s return address, which made Rowena\u2019s stomach do a small, mean thing, because bodies remember bills like an old disagreement. Inside was not a bill, but a note written in a hand that paused where it could and sprinted when forced by habit. The roof, it said in sentences that tried to be gentle, had developed a leak in the thoughtless way roofs do, and the man who had for years appeased it with tar and murmurs had run out of murmurs. The leak would become a complaint and the complaint would become a scandal if addressed with anything less than scaffolding. The sum attached to the solution was not catastrophic and not kind; it was one of those numbers that demands a meeting with the board and a biscuit that believes in you. \u201cWe can do it,\u201d Priya said, instantly and with that maddeningly cheerful confidence she wore like a cardigan, and Rowena nodded because public optimism is the accountant of private terror.\n\nThey went to the house together with a set of keys that pretended to know which lock they belonged to and a package of biscuits that was probably not part of any official list of supplies. The hedge, deciding for once to be helpful, shushed them in, and the cats belonged to other cardigans now and so did not appear, leaving the hallway less scorned, more available. The front room smelled like a memory baked at a low temperature, and in the back where the leak had had its say, a bucket stood on a tapestry mat as if it had been born to perform and had suffered no rehearsal. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to persuade that corner to stop philosophising,\u201d Priya said, looking up where the plaster had chosen a tide line, and then she leaned her head to one side because the house had decided to speak.\n\nThere was a stair, narrow and polite, that no one had bothered since the house had been bequeathed. It led to a half-room under the roof that would not have impressed a council inspector and had an effect on the heart akin to opening a drawer you didn\u2019t know existed. The window was small and city-facing, which in Crawley means chimney-facing, and there was a trunk against the wall with buckles that had insisted on living longer than the people who had closed them. It would have been like the book if it had been empty. It was not. Inside, under a layer of paper that used to be white and had contented itself with cream, were shoes that had danced when the words for dances had longer names, and programmes printed on card soft enough to be kind. There were photographs, the kind where people learned to respect cameras and stood properly, Mrs. Mallory young enough to be amazed by a hat, Henry healthy in that dangerous way men used to wear their shoulders, a room full of faces eager to be well-behaved in a photograph so they could behave less well once it was put away.\n\nRowena lifted a pair of shoes that had been loved into the exact shape of a foot, and she knew the exact day Mrs. Mallory had decided not to throw them away. The programmes were a run of months, tea dances and charity nights in halls that pretended to be ballrooms, with pencilled notes in a hand that surely belonged to Frances or to someone who loved her. \u201cThe quickstep is our argument, dear H,\u201d one read in the margin of a flyer advertising the Pavilion in \u201858, and farther down, \u201cwaltz tonight, be good, be true, be caught.\u201d There was a letter folded so the crease might outlast sense, from a woman named Eileen on paper that had yellowness for ancestry, thanking Frances for \u201cthe loan of that silver brooch and the loan of your courage,\u201d the short paragraph ending with a postscript that could have been showy and wasn\u2019t: \u201cHenry made me feel I had ankles.\u201d\n\nPriya picked up the letter and read it aloud because sometimes the best way to respect a thing is to let it be heard twice. \u201cEileen,\u201d she said, and then looked up, because Eileen had been in the mending circle two days out of three and had danced a slow turn as if learning the shape of her own foot and its stubbornness. \u201cOur Eileen is the Eileen,\u201d she said, and the room did that thing rooms do when a name reaches across decades and sits down comfortably. They stood there for a while, not doing anything silly like weeping or making vows to plasterboard, and then they carried the trunk downstairs as if it contained confidence.\n\nThe board would need numbers and noises and a plan that involved jam. Rowena knew that. She also knew that a good story told at the right time can sell a hundred chairs and at least one ladder. She put the programmes on the piano and the letter where people would see it without touching, and she called Eileen and asked her if she would come to the house with the consent of someone being asked to pose for a painting. Eileen turned up in a skirt that meant business and eyes that watered at everything and refused to be accused of it. She touched the shoe and then, in a movement so small it almost wasn't, put it against her own foot. \u201cI never told anyone about that night,\u201d she said, and it came out like a boiled sweet unwrapped by a child who had been told to wait. \u201cI was seventeen and looked it, and he was gentle with my silliness. He made my sister jealous without trying and reminded me to breathe as if I had been holding my breath in a queue for years. Frances laughed at us as if laughter could be stored. I\u2019d kept the letter in my wardrobe until my sixties and then put it in the trunk because I thought it deserved wood.\u201d\n\nThey made tea and there was a slowness to the pouring that turned it into ceremony. Eileen did not insist on telling the whole of anything, and Rowena did not insist on asking. Priya, who did not interfere in other people\u2019s pacing unless a bus was involved, suggested very quietly that the house could do with dancing in its original language, just once, to persuade the roof that effort was being made. \u201cA night for Henry and Frances,\u201d she said, and the title had the kind of symmetry that fundraisers respect. \u201cWe\u2019ll call it the First Proper Tea Dance because we have no sense and we like the word proper. We\u2019ll bake a cake in the shape of a house and then pretend we didn\u2019t. We\u2019ll ask the youth orchestra to wear black and white, which will ruin several homes\u2019 dignity, and we\u2019ll give Jonah a list of songs that makes him think we\u2019ve been burgling his records.\u201d\n\nThere were practicalities that were less romance and more mop, but Rowena felt the tug of a night that could make a number in a solicitor\u2019s letter blush. She talked to Andy about dresses that respect knees and to the WI about sandwiches that act as ballast; she wrote to the three cardiganed cat-women to ask if Mint, who had the temperament of a headmistress with a hangover, could be brought for an hour to sit on the piano and make a survey of all ankles present; she asked the registrar about the capacity of rooms in ways that proved she had learned not to get told off by the fire brigade. She phoned Jonah while he was on a lunch break, which is not a thing the theatre grants lightly, and asked if he could come not as the telly man but as the boy who had learned to keep time with people whose feet were frightened. He said the company schedule would try to keep him, and then he did a clever thing with a quiet voice and got out.\n\nThe day before the dance, a reporter from a national paper called and then realised he had expected a story that involved sequins and another woman\u2019s failure. Rowena refused to be brash and refused to be ashamed, which left him with very little to chew on, and she gave him Mrs. Mallory\u2019s exact stipulation about cats because it would humanise a house faster than any adjective. He asked her if she worried she had become a brand, and she said she worried she had become a kettle because people expected her to boil on cue, and he laughed and she did not. Kiki\u2019s message pinged an hour later from a train that could not decide whether it was going to stop where it had been told to. She wanted, in exquisite language that had earned her a budget and a hug, to bring a small crew to the tea dance and catch a minute of the room without getting in the way of jam. Rowena considered and said yes but with rules so hygienic they might have been written by a nurse in 1951. \u201cOnly medium shots,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNo close-ups of anyone who did not sign up for a close-up. No filming of tears that haven\u2019t been formally introduced.\u201d\n\nThe morning of the dance had the nervousness of any house that knows it\u2019s about to host relatives who will either be generous or judge the curtains. The roof had been politely propped with tarpaulin and hope, and the front room had been dressed with bunting that made older men pat it when they thought no one was looking. The piano had remembered its point and sat with its lid lifted like a question. Frances\u2019s photograph lived in a frame loaned by Mrs. Croft, who came to everything since her husband had died because she knew how grief goes out at night and eats biscuits if left unsupervised. Eileen arrived with a brooch that had been made to look like a star and wobble like a leaf, and she pinned it below her collarbone with hands that were not assuming they had the right. Jean stood in the doorway and consented to being kissed by people who thought of her as the conscience of the place; she wore shoes that told the truth and stockings that gave away nothing.\n\nThe youth orchestra had found a clarinetist who could play the kind of nonsense people call the golden oldies without blushing, and they did \u201cMoonglow\u201d as if it had been written to pay for a roof in Crawley. Jonah, who had got there by some miracle involving a broken-down van and a bus driver with Lent in his bones, slipped in without ceremony and went straight to the piano, where he put his hands down like a benediction. He played a waltz that would never be recorded and could never be repeated because it was made of the people in the room and the weather, which had decided to be impressed and therefore behave. No one clapped in a way that would make a person embarrassed; they clapped in the way you clap when you recognise your own body in someone else\u2019s kindness.\n\nRowena took people\u2019s coats and took money from people who insisted on disguising it as cake, and she handed older women to chairs with the practised tenderness of a person who puts dignity into the cups with the tea. Colin from the board turned up in a tie that had anxious birds on it and apologised with his whole posture for having ever said sell, and then danced with a woman he had divorced in 1996 for two minutes that made his face not his own. The cats did not come because Mint was in a mood and Persephone had decided she was too old for piano lids, but June consented to sit in the window watching, which is what she does best, and everyone who noticed took this as luck. Kiki kept her camera\u2019s distance and did a strange thing: she put it down sometimes, and drank tea in order to be a person, and Simon held the spare batteries in his palm like he was warming them and looked content to be paid in crumbs.\n\nAt the edge of all of this, Rowena and Jonah did not dance first because being the first couple is not always a compliment. They moved when the floor had become itself and the room could not misunderstand them as a performance. They formed a frame that said, I am going to ask you to be brave with me for exactly three minutes, and she rested her hand in a way that admitted an intimacy without terrifying anyone. He counted quietly into her wrist as if reminding her that time is negotiable if you have two bodies trying. They made their way past Mrs. Croft, who muttered \u201clook at them, behaving,\u201d and past Eileen, who stood for a second as if to hold her own bones accountable, and then sat because her stories were heavy now and could only be carried by someone else\u2019s son at a piano. When the song ended, there was a small thing like the town letting its breath go, and the tin under the donations table had money in it that did not apologise.\n\nThey reached the number that would pay a scaffolder who had the decency to answer his phone and the decency to charge slightly less than market because his mother had told him to, and they reached it well before the last slice of cake had been cut. Rowena had the satisfaction of pretending not to notice while Priya did the exact opposite across the room, counting quietly in her head like a drummer with a stolen calculator. When people began to leave, they left slowly, because you don\u2019t hurry a room that has turned into a solution; they said things that looked like compliments and felt like more than that, and more than one of them forced money into Rowena\u2019s hand as if her hand was some sort of amino acid required for survival. Eileen stayed until the piano had been closed and the biscuits had been promoted to the back door for sharing with the starlings, and then she took her brooch off and put it into Rowena\u2019s hand and said, \u201cHold it for the next girl who forgets her ankles and thinks she is not made for turning.\u201d Rowena put it in the drawer where she kept the keys to the house, and later she moved it to the drawer where she kept courage, which looked to other people like a sewing basket.\n\nThe morning after is always a Tuesday, even when the calendar insists it is not, and the town wore its usual face and then glanced at itself in a passing window, pleased without boasting. The roofers came with hats and radios and a respect for the piano that endeared them to Jean, who fed them biscuits as if she had hired them and, in a way, had. The youth orchestra sent a thank-you card hand-lettered by the clarinetist, which had a sticker of a trumpet that had seen better papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 days, and on the back a drawing from the flautist that appeared to be a cat playing a waltz, which everyone agreed was anatomically unconvincing and emotionally precise. Priya wore a grin that frightened the council and the editor and made the dentist sigh with resignation because grins do nothing for molar grinding.\n\nThere were dull difficulties too, because romance is not a substitute for maintenance. The council\u2019s procurement department wanted three quotes for every ladder, Carole from accounts insisted Eileen\u2019s brooch count as an asset in the ledger until Rowena put her finger on the page and said, \u201cNo,\u201d in a tone that suggested the day would go on without that particular absurdity, and an anonymous email arrived that accused them of taking attention away from problems that had fewer posters. Rowena did what she had learned to do with anonymous emails, which was to send them to Priya, who laughed in a kind way and then filed them under \u201csound and fury,\u201d and then wrote to the person whose name she could not see as if kindness could bounce off the screen and land somewhere useful, asking them for coffee, which they would never take because anonymity is intoxicating and coffee makes it sober.\n\nJonah went back to London and the run, which had decided he was useful and therefore demanded to keep him on a stage that smelled of dust and expensive compromises. He would send photographs now and then of dressing room announcements and shoes that had new scuffs to brag about, and she would send him images of the ordinary doing its best: the violinist\u2019s terrier in a scarf against reason, the wall at the centre with a new small chalk drawing of a bicycle too confident for its own tyres, Priya asleep at her desk pretending to be reading a report about bins. They had learned a kind of patience that felt less like waiting and more like a particular way of staying awake. He found a metronome in a second-hand shop that looked like it had told lies to several teachers and sent it to her with a note that said, \u201cFor nights when the radio refuses to behave.\u201d She found a key ring with a small enamel Mallory house on it at a craft fair and posted it without a note because their jokes did not need explaining.\n\nKiki\u2019s follow-up aired lightly and without insult, a rare thing in the country at that moment, and Crawley watched itself not with pride so much as with relief. It featured the car park lighted like a gala and children\u2019s faces blurred of course but readable in their joy, and it dared to include thirty seconds of the tea dance without treating it like a curiosity. Mrs. Croft appeared wearing a hat and talking about movement like sarcastic scripture, and Jean allowed a sentence about libraries that caused three people in the council to sit up straighter. The piece ended on a shot of the beanie painted over the tiara on the wall and the swallow shutters, and the voiceover said something mercifully brief about \u201chome,\u201d and Rowena did not throw things at the screen because nothing had been made thinner for ease of consumption.\n\nThe library\u2019s Saturday experiment thickened into routine, which is to say it started to feel like a thing that had been true for years. Mark ran the sheet with a benevolence that terrifies teenagers, and Eileen took the eleven o\u2019clock slot to teach a boy called Dev how to hem trousers, and a woman called Bev, who insisted on using her name as a rhyme whenever possible, started a once-monthly poetry circle that had no agenda and yet produced lines that made Rowena\u2019s skin decide to become a drum. Priya invented a mending kit for books that had been loved too hard and labelled it like a joke with \u201ctriage,\u201d and the boys who had preferred shelves to people began to turn up with friends who preferred phones until the phones failed to compete with a man reading aloud that sentence from Wind in the Willows about pootling, which is always fatal to battery life.\n\nJean had a day that frightened nobody but herself, a breath that went sideways for longer than it ought, a seat taken with more care than usual, and a doctor's advice that used words like potassium and breath work and made Rowena put the kettle on with violence and watch the steam rise like an answer to a question she hadn\u2019t asked. It passed, as most things do when treated suddenly with attention and a rest and the knowledge that the human body responds to being asked rather than ordered, but it rearranged a week. Rowena found herself suddenly assessing chairs as if they were co-conspirators and moving everything one inch closer to the floor. Jean, who had always resented being fussed over because fuss is an admission of failure she doesn\u2019t subscribe to, allowed fuss within a tiny, well-marshalled zone and turned her attention instead to the problem of men putting spoons in the wrong part of drawers, which she claimed was the beginning of the end of civilisation. They spent an afternoon together in that particular friendship mothers and daughters have when both have decided not to test any walls, and the house felt satisfied because houses like it when people behave like relatives.\n\nOn a day with light so thin it refused to be measured, a letter arrived at the office written in a pen that had big ideas for itself. It came from a school in the next town over where the headteacher used words like initiative so often they had lost dignity, and it said there was a group of girls who had been told very politely that they danced like boys, and they had gone quiet, and would Rowena come and bring silence breakers. The letter was not good at asking, and it was full of the kind of guilt that suggests nobody had actually done anything wrong, and the girls were probably bored to within inches of revolt. Rowena took it to Thursday class, which was in session with Jonah on a Wednesday night video call held up to the group like an improbable relative. She asked the girls if they would like to go to the next town and be accused of being boys, and they found this both insulting and thrilling, as if being mislabelled could be mischief. They practised walking across a room in ways that would terrify anyone who\u2019d ever called something girly as an insult, not because they tried to be masculine, but because they behaved as if their bodies belonged to them like postcode: definite, dull to outsiders, essential. It is not a story with an ending; it is a story with an appointment time and a ride on a bus, and they went, and the other girls looked at them and looked at their own legs and the mirror, and the whole room got more complicated and therefore better.\n\nThe terrier got a coat in the end, red and ridiculous and worn with the dignity only small dogs can pull off when it is raining in sheets instead of individual acts, and the violinist nodded at Rowena the way men nod when they share no information and all of it. Simon got asked by Priya to come to dinner at the house with the mending circle by accident and found himself at a table where sewing and flirting are permitted to meet. He arrived with a salad none of them needed and a joke that had only undergone minimal testing, and he left three hours later with a date that was not called that because he and Priya had agreed no nouns would be used without consent. Lydia sent a photograph of her mother dancing with her scarf while their kettle breathed and wrote, \u201cThis will have to do for now,\u201d and Rowena wrote back a photograph of a stack of \u201cseason of opportunity\u201d flyers from Jonah\u2019s theatre being used as coasters at the Mallory tea dance and captioned it, \u201cThis will have to do always.\u201d\n\nOn an afternoon when the town smelt of leaf mould and intent, the solicitor came by without drama to sign something that would make the house officially belong to the Trust in the way it had already emotionally itched to. He brought a fountain pen with a nib like a dagger and a cake that suggested he had learned office politics, and he tried the front-room floor with his shoe as people do when they consider whether a house can take more laughter than it is used to. \u201cShe\u2019d be pleased,\u201d he said without any more context, because grief and inheritance make you comfortable with incomplete sentences. Rowena wrote her name in the spot where names stop being signatures and become responsibility, and felt nothing theatrically awful, only the small rearrangement inside that happened whenever she agreed to be late for her own comfort in order to be on time for somebody else.\n\nWhen it snowed, which it always promises and rarely delivers and then over-delivers the one time you told a child not to expect it, Crawley wore its mistakes well. The buses came when they could and were forgiven. The centre became a place where wet feet were allowed and lined the entrance like a tiny art installation. The library\u2019s radiators sang a little and then worked as hard as they were able. The Mallory house hedges held their own festival of geometry. The tea dance was moved to the afternoon because everyone agreed, without consulting any rules, that darkness is not a partner you need for that particular tradition. Jonah sent a message from a stage door with a photograph of snow that had tried to be a metaphor and failed, and a picture of a bow tie that had been tied by someone other than a mirror. The Thursday class turned into a dance in boots on the park\u2019s bandstand because dancers will dance and teenagers will do anything for a photograph that involves breath you can see. Jean watched it all from the window like a person who has learned to calibrate warmth in her own bones, and when Rowena came in, full of the particular hurt that wet socks deliver, she said, \u201cThe kettle is a religion today,\u201d and put it on in a way that made steam seem like a miracle that had agreed to be domesticated.\n\nThe night the snow refused to be romantic and became dangerous, a girl from the Thursday class called because she had been told to and she always did what she was told until she learned a better way. Her mother had been delayed on a bus that had got it into its head to rest in a verge, and her little brother had decided he was not ready to be brave without adult supervision, and could someone sit on a sofa and look at him until the house remembered how to behave. Rowena went with her Sunday calm and her Thursday energy, and she sat on their sofa under a crocheted blanket that had opinions, and she read a book about a mouse who stole a grain of rice and made a friend of a bird, and the boy\u2019s breathing agreed to return to its timetable. When the mother arrived with her hands like small furnaces and apologies, Rowena took her own coat and her own courage and turned them into a photograph in her head labelled, \u201cwhy we do this,\u201d which she would never show at a presentation because real things with small faces do not belong on slides.\n\nOn a morning when the kettle and the sky were in amicable pale agreement, Jonah came back on a day off with the sheepishness of a man who wanted to be heroic about timing and had been beaten by trains. He had a bruise on his wrist he called theatrical and a grin that had not learned to behave in the face of news. He said his grandmother had gone very quiet after the first week of the run and then had begun to speak with great force about the morality of curtain calls. He ate toast with jam like a person who had not been fed backstage food in too many days and told Rowena about a boy in the cast who had never been to a library and had stood in one in Soho as if expecting someone to charge him rent. They walked to the park and did a tiny turn on the bridge where nobody watched them because they were not fifteen and not famous, and later they stood at the Mallory house window and waved at Eileen, who was teaching a woman called Teresa how to thread a needle without invoking a saint.\n\nThey did not decide anything about the shape of themselves because they had learned that decisions made on Tuesdays are less honest than those made on ordinary weather. He kissed her just once in a room that had a trestle table and bunting and the vague smell of furniture polish, and it felt like the kind of sentence you can finish in your own time. Priya walked in with a carrier bag of oranges and did not roll her eyes because she is kinder than that; she put the oranges down and said, \u201cYou will both need vitamin C for whatever you are getting yourselves into,\u201d and went to deal with a man who had brought a violin to the mending circle on the misunderstanding that all broken things accepted glue.\n\nBy the end of the year the car park lights were old news, which is another way of saying they had succeeded. The library had a rota for Saturdays that did not collapse when people went on holiday or broke toes on furniture or fell in love. The Mallory house roof stopped trying to be a commentary and accepted being a roof. The violinist acquired a new piece that had no name and therefore was called after a biscuit, and the terrier allowed its red coat to be washed without going to war. Lydia appeared on a radio show and said no twice politely and yes once carefully and was praised by a woman who sounded like she had only learned to praise recently. Mark turned up at the office with a suit he had borrowed from an uncle and a question about applying for a job that would have him run a youth theatre in a town Rowena had only ever visited for petrol and a child\u2019s temper tantrum, and they wrote the application together in a way that would have made his English teacher sigh with pleasure and pride.\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Eve, which in Crawley is family and pub and fireworks and a refusal to be ashamed of loving the smell of chips at midnight, the community centre held an event that was part vigil, part dance, part stubbornness. They hung last year\u2019s bunting and played a playlist that tried to be nobody\u2019s enemy, and they asked the youth orchestra for a piece that involved everyone, and the cellist cried exactly where you would expect and the drummer did a small solo when nobody was ready and made a mistake and turned it into a joke and then into love. Rowena stood at the back for a while as if she had just arrived in the world and was assessing it with her usual critical generosity. Priya came up beside her with a paper cup and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to make a speech before midnight because the year will think it owes you something,\u201d and Rowena laughed and said she had used all her speeches up and could only dance.\n\nThey danced at midnight without counting, which for a person like Rowena counts as a sin and therefore felt like a gift. She turned once on lino that had seen a generation of chairs, and she did it without apology to her ankle, which accepted the invitation like an old friend who had been waiting for the phone to ring. The year didn\u2019t sneeze at her or hit her on the back of the head; it let her step in without ceremony, and she made one of those private, ridiculous promises to herself that involved kettles and benches and a respect for Thursdays. When she went home, Jean had fallen asleep with the radio on because news insists even at the edge of years, and Rowena turned it off and kissed her mother\u2019s hair, which smelled like the kind of shampoo stubborn women choose and then never change. Outside, Crawley did its best with fireworks on a budget and made a noise that was not metropolitan and not embarrassed, and inside, Rowena put her hand flat on the kitchen table as if testing if it would hold, and it did. She breathed in three and out three and allowed herself a wicked, precise wish for the year: that nothing spectacular happen and everything important continue.\n\nJanuary does not keep promises; it merely provides a cold room and a chair and then looks at you to see what you do. In that room Rowena sat with Priya and made the lists that would govern the months ahead, and she wrote down names that had become verbs: Eileen to teach, Jonah to call, Lydia to say no, Mark to send a text at silly hours with a question dressed as an apology, Jean to schedule gently with a doctor who had learned the art of telling bad news with good eyebrows. The kettle did its theatre. The town tried. The door stuck. The roof held. The music in the Mallory house was, through some trick of wood and habit, still playing even when nobody touched the keys. They went on, which is not a dismissive sentence; it is the kind of sentence a person saves for times when they need to remind themselves that insistence is not always the same as noise.",
