The gulls in Portsmouth never shut up. They trawl the sky with beaks open and eyes like buttons, voices full of tin, loud enough to drown the ferry horns and the traffic and the banging from the shipyard that begins somewhere before dawn and doesn’t end even when the sky is ink. I grew up thinking noise was a kind of weather. It presses on you here. You breathe salt and diesel and the squeal of brakes, and you spit out grit and someone else’s conversation.

I told myself I liked it, even when I knew I didn’t. It’s not that easy to leave, when you don’t know what is yours besides the smell of the water and the corners of streets you learned by heart. When you have nobody to miss you if you go, the place itself digs in its claws. It pretends to be family.

Most mornings I opened Templar’s Fish on the Harbour with a key that stuck and a shoulder that already hurt from nothing. The awning would clatter when I tugged it down. The floor was stupidly wet even before I hosed it, because condensation dripped from the fluorescent tubes like the ceiling was sweating. There’s always a sense of bodies in a fish shop. All those bodies of fish laid out with their sides parted, skin like stories, the ongoing conversation of eyes that don’t look at you but you feel watched anyway.

I’m not good with bodies. Skin can be okay. A bruise is fine. But blood—that’s been tricking me for years. It started like a fainting goat trick, some party act I didn’t ask for. I would be fine, and then I would see blood and be less fine. People think you fake it. People think it’s something you put on. They think, especially here, where everyone stitches themselves closed with fishing line and carries on, that fear is a luxury. They don’t say that. They say, “Get over it, Ellis,” like it’s a puddle and not a trench. They say, “We all have things, mate.” They pat you. Or they laugh if you topple over near the scallops.

“Briggs,” said Mr. Hobb that Monday. He had ears that seemed to be climbing off his head. “Door.” He always thought he didn’t need full sentences with me, or the vowels went home early. “Ice comes in half an hour.”

“Right,” I said. My mouth didn’t feel like mine. It never did around him. He had a way of turning a person into their hands. I was hands with him: hands to lift, to rinse, to trim.

If I could have had just fish—no blood, no knives, no cut fingers—I would have taken that deal. I liked the weight of mackerel, that sweet heft. Their patterning like the inside of a church roof. I liked the fast work of snapping bones out with a grip and a twist you learn by watching and not by being told. But blood is not so obliging. It threads itself through the day even when you think you’ll be clever and avoid it. A paper cut in the till. A nick open on the side of someone’s thumb from last week that decides to say hello again at the worst possible moment. And then there was my own skin, which has always been reckless and soft, which lets in the world with too much good grace.

The ice man came, and the floor turned into a low fog when we spread the crushed snow. It filmed my boots, made them squeal. Kai came late, as he did, swinging his helmet by the strap and grinning like everything is always going to be fine because so far for him it had been. “You look pale, El,” he said. He called everyone by a nickname as if we were all happily shorter.

“Early,” I said. “Not awake yet.”

“Who is,” he said, and then he leaned across the counter to pinch a crayfish and made it wave like he was a conjuror. “Don’t worry, you’ll be a zombie with the rest of us by ten, you’ll catch up.”

When customers come, there are two kinds of morning. There is the morning where everything is small talk and change that makes sense and your hands stay your hands. And there is the other kind, where someone wants to tell you about their mother’s gout or the way the price of sandeels is what finally convinced them the country’s gone to hell. You smile, you say, “Yes, Mrs. Carrow,” and you pretend your nails are not going numb. The numbness is warning. It says: something will show you red before you can think yourself safe.

It was a boy. Of course it was. Some boys have made themselves out of dares, like someone dared them to be alive at all and they took it too far. He was the kind with a new haircut that tried to be a decision. He leaned under the sign, he breathed fog on the glass, he pointed at the mullet like he was choosing ammunition. “That one,” he said. “My mum said I should choose something oily.”

“Good choice,” said Kai, who liked to convert customers more than he liked to slice. He went to weigh it and tell the boy a price that made him glance toward the world for permission. When the boy agreed, when the notes were wet still, when the tilting of the scale made the fish’s mouth gape—then my knife slipped. There is nothing in the world like the sound of a blade making a decision without you. It was a syllable, a short remark, a yes that was not mine.

I didn’t look first. You learn not to look. I felt the sting and the little hot movement like something alive had woken in my thumb, and I thought, I will not, I will not, it’s too little to count. But the brain has tricks too. You can swear you will be a person who stays on his feet and then you will be a person who is sideways, holding the counter too hard, listening to Kai laugh without malice, listening to the boy say, “Mate, are you all right?” which is a question you can answer only with a sound. The sound I made might have been “Mm.” It might have been the birds outside.

“Jesus,” said Hobb, like a prayer. “Not again.”

I wasn’t on the floor but I became floor-fast; the angle of the metal shelf bit my shoulder and I thought about the way the gulls always find the most brittle edge of a day and lean there. Blood is a colour that turns loud in my head. It is water with a voice. It is thick air. When I see it on me, I become the size of a coin and I fall through the slot that life keeps ready, and out the other side is a quiet I don’t want.

Kai had a cloth, he had something cheerful to say about last night, about the match, about the ferry that came in with all its lights out because someone forgot, which we both knew wasn’t true. He held the cloth to my hand as if the colour was not the problem. He said, “Over quick,” and I tried to believe him. The boy took his mullet, and I could feel him take his mullet, and I could hear the door, and someone else came in, and Hobb told me with that pinch in his voice that everything I touched had turned to difficulty.

“You don’t get to faint in a fish shop,” he said when the boy was gone and the counter was empty. “You don’t get to faint anywhere, but especially not here.”

I said, “I didn’t faint.” My mouth went dry because we both knew I had hung on the edge and it was not respectable.

He wiped the knife on the blade of another knife, which is something he did that made no sense, like sharpening grief with more grief. “If you can’t manage a nick, Briggs, you can’t manage the rush. I can't be watching you like a baby, we have paying people.”

“I know,” I said, and the cloth stuck.

You’d think someone might be curious enough to ask, what is it for you, the blood. You’d think. Mostly they say, “Everyone’s had worse.” Or they say, “My uncle chopped his thumb clean off and he still finished his tea.” It can be true and not helpful. I tried to say, “It’s not the pain. It’s not even—” but then Hobb was called by the bell and a woman who wanted to argue about cod, and I stood still and thought about breathing like it was a brand new thing.

At nine I went for a cup from the little machine that wheezed like it was burning from within. When the lid clicked on, when the steam licked my mouth, I saw behind the counter a thin man standing like a question. People like that always know you. He wore a suit that was brave enough to be the wrong blue, and a tie that had a story I didn’t care for. His shoes knew rain.

“Ellis?” he said, as if he had found me hiding and meant to be kind about it.

Here is a thing: I don’t have a lot of people who know me to look at me like that, with welcome that hurts. I am used to being whoever is needed for the moment. “Yes,” I said, because I wasn’t going to pretend.

“Been a while,” he said. He came to the edge where the glass turned and he smiled, and the smile was wrong on his face for a second, like he’d borrowed it and found the fit too large. “You don’t know me. No reason you would. I know your sister.”

I did something I do when I am not ready for a sentence. I turned the cup and turned it again and I watched the little noise in the lid where steam bursts free. “I don’t have—”

“Tamsin,” he said. “Tamsin Keen, from Somers, back when. I’m running an insurance office in North End now, wouldn’t know it, right? But there is no escaping school. She said, you know Ellis, don’t you? I said I knew a boy with a mouth like a question mark and a way of walking like he’s apologising to the pavement. And she said, that’s him.”

My name in his mouth made something cold shift under my tongue. Tamsin’s name did something worse. It walked into the room like someone you forgot you had locked out, and now the lock is useless. I held the counter. I told my hands to stop being hands and be wood.

“She said if I saw you I should say hello,” he said, watching me like he knew where the edge was and like people do when they want to go to it. “And tell you she’s got work now. She’s doing… something with events. Weddings. You know, never a quiet day in that.”

A real person would have said, “Tell her hello back.” A braver one would have said, “You’re lying,” but not in the flat voice that came into my throat. An even braver one would have asked him to describe her hair now, her voice, whether she still shifted her weight like standing still was a lie. I didn’t ask. I said, “Right. Cheers.” The coffee burned my lip. I tasted that instead of all the other things.

He looked like he’d come to the wrong shop and taken sugar. “She said the starlings are back on the Common. I thought you’d—you know.”

“Hm.”

“Anyway. Good to see you breathing,” he said, and then he was gone, as if he had never learned to leave rooms properly.

Kai came back in with two men carrying a box of mussels between them, shoulders leaned to a slope. He said, “You all right?” because he asks a lot of questions as jokes and then sometimes they find themselves serious.

“Fine,” I said. He let me be.

At lunch I took a packet of crisps to the loading bay and listened to the rhythm of the ships, the clank of chain on a boat that looked like a toy in a child’s bath. The sky had a colour I wanted to give a name to. In school they told us poets own all the names, and the rest of us have to borrow. I didn’t have money for that. The gulls were louder to punish us for the chips. I thought about Tamsin the way you think about a light in a house you don’t live in anymore. She isn’t my sister the way she would say she is. We share no blood, no mother’s cheekbones. We shared a bathroom for three years in a house in Fratton where the doors didn’t close properly and the garden was more nettles than grass and the landlord’s name was Marwick but he asked you to call him M.

We shared a father because I didn’t have one. I had a man who appeared late in my life and said, “Son,” like he’d rehearsed it. Mum had been five years dead then and the state had been grumbling that I wasn’t small enough for attention, that I could heat my own soup. His name was Colin Briggs and I took it because names are coats and I was cold. He lasted eighteen months, the way some lights do. He went out on the water one day and something came down and broke the horizon, and he didn’t come back. In that eighteen months he brought with him a woman who knew the trick of turning a kettle into supper, and her daughter who had sharp shoulders and little patience for my quiet.

Tamsin. She had a laugh that was here-we-go and a way of looking over your head like there was a better conversation happening six and a half feet off the floor. You liked her and then you were sorry. That was her trick. Her mother, Rena, acted like this was the best anyone could be, bright and hard; she made tea like medicine and told me my hair needed a story and cut it herself with the kitchen scissors. After Colin didn’t come back, Rena and I startled at each other for a time, then did what people do and stayed because moving takes a different kind of bravery. I paid rent to Marwick by putting cash in an envelope and not looking him in the eye. Rena cleaned the surgery on Elm Grove and brought home paper towels like a crow’s hoard. Tamsin brought home boys sometimes, later girls, and once a dog that turned out to be a fox. We were nothing like a family, and we were the closest thing to one I had had in years. You can be both.

I saw blood on a picture in a magazine once and hit the floor. Rena clucked and said the word therapist the way people say toothache. She made a call and then didn’t make another when the numbers came back with glare on them. The first time I cut myself badly washing a pint glass at the Fawcett, there was a mess and a man with a tattoo of a bird said, “He’s being dramatic,” and I wasn’t, but it didn’t matter. I learned brakes I could use on myself; I learned to leave the room before the red got writing in it. I learned to be boring. Friends I didn’t have many. People with patience for this particular failure are rare. Kai stuck because he still thought everything could be negotiated with charm and the right shoes.

There was a Sunday, years ago, when the sky had been white for days and the pavements stitched in frost. Tamsin had come back from somewhere with friends who had eyes like wolves, and they had sat on the steps and smoked and laughed like they had seen a fight and enjoyed it. She went upstairs to change her earrings and I followed because I wanted to ask her to turn the music down and because the smell of her perfume, spiky and brave, made the house feel like a place where stories might decide not to end. I have a shard of memory that shines too large—her standing with a scarf around her neck, red as a Christmas apple, and saying, “Don’t be so poor, Ellis, it’s pathetic,” and me saying something I can’t remember, and her laughing and pushing me like she was an older brother. Then the stairs tilted. That is as far as my head will let me. There is a wall there. If I push it, it moves in small sick inches, and then it snaps back and makes a noise like someone retching. I went to bed. When I woke, a decade had passed. That’s not how time works for people who are well.

When Hobb let me go, there was no argument. He said, “We can’t keep doing this,” and I said, “No.” He said, “You’re good with the old ducks, but I need less drama,” and I said, “Of course,” and then he said, “It’s two weeks and the time we owe you,” like he couldn’t keep the numbers in his teeth. I nodded. This is the part where you ask for another chance, and I was too tired to pretend I deserved one. The relief on his face was petty but useful. Everyone likes a story where they are the adult.

I went home to the flat that was less a place than a series of corners I knew in the dark. I have had this one for three years, second floor, Southsea side, a view of rooftops that terraform themselves into hope when the sun is low. The carpet is brown that insists on being called something else. The window sighs. The kettle is loyal. My mother’s photo is near the kettle because Rena said that’s where she would want to be, nosy about tea, and I have decided to agree with women who use the word nosy as a blessing. The bed is higher than makes sense, to give the under-space a duty. The drawers stick. The bathroom is a negotiation with mildew.

The letter was under the door and had been there long enough to leave a faint crease in the thready mat. It said my name on it. The handwriting was a fight between neat and hurry. I knew the loop of the L like the tilt of the town hall. I put the kettle back on its base and my hands were damp and I felt the room step away from me in case I wanted to fall. The envelope was cheap. I opened it as if that would control the words.

Ellis, it said, and nothing else for a line. The lines are a story too. You can tell when someone put the pen down and thought, when they went to the window to see if the rain was ready.

Ellis, I saw you in the market but I wasn’t ready to say it out loud. I am bad that way. Don’t be cross. I’m doing weddings. Can you imagine. So I can be paid to tell people what not to do, which is the job I trained for by being married to this place. Rena is—well, not so well as we’d pretend out loud, but she’s got her soaps and her tea and her teeth in the right order. I’ll come by. Or you can come to the Common at five, the starlings are a show again. We can be civil if we try. T.

The T was big and then apologised for itself with a little flick. I turned the paper and there was nothing there. Her smell had been somewhere between cigarette smoke and apple shampoo when she lived in my pockets. Here it was cheap ink, damp. I put the letter on the table and then I put the kettle on again because it seemed wrong to sit, or stand, with that and be dry. I listened to the city for a while. Someone shouted a name out the window and the name answered from two streets over, which is how it goes. The gulls edited themselves into softer. A child started crying and then restarted because his mother told him he was finished.

The fear does not care for sense. It is like hunger in that way. The letter was not red. My hands found the ghost of a cut beneath the plaster and woke it without touching. My head went to the stairs and refused to go further. It stood on top, looking down, counting the steps it was not going to take. The steps got taller, which is what fear does to stairs. My heartbeat tried on a coat that didn’t fit. I said out loud, “Stop,” because sometimes the word helps. It did not.

At four I walked to the Common because I am not brave but I know how to do the small brave thing that is leave the house when it would be easier not to. The City spread itself like it was pretending to be a painting of itself. The Spinnaker Tower did its needle trick against a sky that had found blue last minute. I walked past a dog that had the face of a judge. The people were out because light had come back and we don’t waste it. The water had the mood where it thinks it is beautiful and then it is. You can sit on the wall and pretend to be sly and no one will notice if you are really just a person who doesn’t know how to begin. I sat. My hands wanted to be pockets but I let them be thighs.

She stood twenty yards away like she had accidentally invented the path. This is the part where I am supposed to say, I saw her and my heart did a thing. It did, but not the thing you think. It fell into my stomach like a coin lands in a U-bend and gets stuck there to make trouble. She looked like herself in the way you do when you’ve been away from a person’s face and then it is again the face your mind kept secretly drawing in the margins of lists. Her hair was lighter, not honest blonde but the kind of blonde you choose to be, and shorter, and not behaving. Her jaw had made a decision. She wore trainers like she’d made a truce with blisters. She had a coat that was expensive in a way you only get from being near weddings.

“Tams,” I said, and the name came out as if the air had practice.

“El,” she said, which hurt, and she walked and then stopped and then walked again. “Hello.”

We did not hug. We did not shake hands. We faced the birds because it is easier to look at birds than each other. Starlings don’t care if you don’t manage small talk. They made their clouds and then unmade them. They spoke their script on the sky. People clapped for them without knowing they were doing it.

“So you’ve been doing fish,” she said, as if she needed to come in at an angle.

“Have been,” I said. “Done now.” I held up my thumb as if that made sense of anything.

She gave me a look that remembered everything and chose not to use it. “Still have the… thing?”

“I do.” My voice was smaller than mine. “Yes.”

“Cousin’s like that,” she said, though I had never known she had one. “She faints if you show her a tomato wrong.” She smiled, because she had to. “I, on the other hand, am blood. Me and it, we’re mates.” She grinned. It tried to be light. It tried to say we were both alive.

I said, “You wrote.” It was the only brave thing I could think of.

“I did,” she said. She kicked at the edge of a square of grass and the grass held. “You looked like you wanted to be left alone when I saw you at the market. Also, the man you work with looks like if you distract him, he’ll eat someone.”

“That’s accurate,” I said, and she smiled the right way this time, and I felt something in me put down a bag it had been carrying.

“How’s Rena?” I said.

“Like a houseplant the day before you remember to water it,” she said. “Not too bad. We’re getting her looked at for her knees. She says the doctor is a child and she won’t have a child tell her how to be seventy-one, but she’ll go. She always goes. I’m with her Tuesdays now.”

“You look—” I began and then stopped because the words I wanted made me sound like I had been keeping a scrapbook. Different but the same. Better around the eyes. Tired in the places she’d always run. She looked like she’d gone somewhere and come back and pretended it was a different place. “You look the same,” I said, which is what people say when they don’t know what else to say.

“Liar,” she said, gentler than I deserved. “You look thinner and older and like you’re pretending not to be looking at the water.”

“I am looking at the water,” I said.

“Sure.” She slipped a cigarette out of a pocket and tucked it behind her ear like a joke. “You still can’t do it?”

“Do what?”

“Say what you mean,” she said. “It’s all right. Nobody in this town does. You say half a thing and assume the other person knows the other half because we all went to the same four places when we were twelve. We didn’t, though. You were late.” She nudged my shoe with hers and it felt like school.

The birds folded themselves into black. The light went slow orange like it had a plan. I thought about the stairs again, and the scarf, and the way air tastes in a narrow hall. I thought of a sound my brain keeps under a cloth like an unkind present. I will not lift the cloth, not here. We are being civil.

“Do you ever—” I started and stopped again. “Do you ever have that thing where… you remember something and then you can’t tell if you remember it or if you’re making it?”

“All the time,” she said. “Isn’t that what remembering is.” She pulled her coat tighter. “Sometimes I think I had a dog when I was little, and then I remember we had Mrs. Farish’s dog for a week and it peed on everything I love and never came back, and my brain went, well, we tried. Also sometimes I think Mum and I lived in a house with a blue door, but really that was a mould incident.”

“I think about the stairs,” I said. I don’t know why I said it. The birds made a shape like a river. She stilled, and the stilling was loud.

“Don’t,” she said, almost under her breath. “We said civil. We can do the other kind later. I had to work to learn how to keep tea in a cup and not throw it. I’d like to hold on to that.”

“Okay,” I said. We breathed. We watched the sky fold into itself. People began to go because they had children and ovens and lives. We stayed because we did not.

She said, “I have to be at Gunwharf at seven. There’s a couple from Havant, she wants lilies in December and he wants it to cost ten pounds. We’re going to compromise and have cardboard.”

“Can you break them?” I said, and then regretted it, because it was a mean joke and we used to be mean together when we thought that was power.

She looked at me with her grin that had grown up a little without asking. “You know I don’t break anything. Not on purpose.” She tilted her head toward the Common and the silent, thrumming thing we had made by being there, the space around us that was between people and not emptiness. “You going to be all right?”

“Yes,” I said, which is always one of the names for no.

“You really should eat,” she said, which was something Rena used to ask me as if hunger was a question I had forgotten to answer. “Do you want to come? I can sort something. Free food. Caterers throw things out if no one looks.”

“My stomach is not brave,” I said. “Another time.”

“Fine,” she said. She leaned in a fraction and then didn’t. “We’ll do it properly. We’ll talk about the things we don’t. I can break out the old knives.”

“Don’t,” I said, before I could catch it, and she blinked. I said, softer, “Don’t talk about knives.”

She nodded. She turned away. She turned back to say something else and then let it go. “Okay. Night, El.”

“Night,” I said, and watched her leave. She walked like a person who expects ground. Some people do. I pretended to be one while I watched until she was a small shape. I went the other way, toward streets that remembered me better than I liked.

On the way home I passed a group outside a pub who were arguing about the offside rule as if it were philosophy. A woman on a bike swore at a taxi and the taxi bowed. A boy, too young to be out in that jacket without someone noticing, was sitting on a low wall counting money with his head down like counting was prayer. People are not subtle here. They are brave with their faces. They are cruel with their laughter. I avoid the drink when my head is behaving like a horse that saw a plastic bag and decided it was death, but I went into the public house because I didn’t want to go home and be the only voice.

The Fawcett had new paint I hated. The tables were the same, and if you leaned your hip against them, they said your name in splinters. The barmaid looked like the kind of person who used to be called girl and knows better now. She said, “What can I do you for?” on autopilot, and I asked for a lemonade and a glass of ice like I was pretending to be a soft person.

A man near the window spilled ketchup on his hand, looked at it without seeing, made a joke and smeared it with a napkin. My throat tried to be clever about it; I told it to stand down. The men at the back cheered at something recorded. Kai texted me that I was a child for leaving early and that Hobb was relieved not to have to stand me up in front of the crabs like a lesson. He put four skull emojis like a threat, then a fish, then an accidental train.

“Ellis,” someone said, and there are only a handful of voices that can summon me like a stone dislodged by a boot, and one of them I hadn’t heard in ten years except when I was very tired. I turned and the room changed sizes.

Rena had the look of someone whose body belonged to the person she was twenty and then remembered otherwise. She had a shopping bag that had lived many lives, and she wore lipstick the colour of old berries. Her knees were angry at her and she had convinced them to be polite. She said my name again, like a scold and a prayer.

“Rena,” I said, and the bar folded time for me at no charge.

“What are you doing in a pub?” she said, like I was a sugar lump she had caught in the flour jar. “You don’t like them.”

“I’m here for the ambient wisdom,” I said.

She snorted. “You look terrible.”

“Thank you,” I said.

She was never unkind in the way that makes scars; she was unkind in the way that makes you remember to eat before she sees you. She peered at my bandage. “You’ve been being stupid.”

“Occupational hazard,” I said. “How’s your leg?”

“Not mine anymore,” she said, and laughed, and then she blinked and sat without being asked as if the chair had stood up for her. “I seen Tams.”

“So did I,” I said.

She nodded in that way she has where her head makes the yes and her mouth says no. “She says you’re going to try to be civil. I said dear God, not that, anything but nice. You were terrible at that as a boy. Like a cat in shoes.”

“I can pretend.”

She took my hand and turned it like she was changing the channel. “You still do that thing.”

“I still do that thing,” I said.

“Have you tried not,” she said, and then looked ashamed of the joke, which made it sweeter. “You know I love you, dear heart,” she said, and she said it like she does, like she was fixing a picture on a wall. “You look like you’re carrying a football under your ribs. Put it down.”

“I will,” I lied.

She looked at the door, because she was always waiting for someone to come through it or fall through it or be dragged. “I’ve got to go to bingo, and you won’t come because you think you’re not old. Come for me, so people will think I matter.”

“I don’t want to step on the sacred cows,” I said. “Another time.”

“Another time soon,” she said. “You know, they say around the estate that Mr. Marwick fell down his own steps last week. Funny what the world will do when you’re not watching it. Cracked his leg like a breadstick. Made a right noise. I heard it from the bins.”

I looked up. The sound of something breaking is my nightmare’s favourite trick. “Is he—?”

“He’ll mend,” she said, with the sourness you keep for landlords. “Tamsin says she told him not to carry more boxes than sense, and then of course he did. She was there. She tried to help him and he told her to fly into the sea, like a sideways poet. The ambulance came like they remembered where we lived, and the young man in charge had a nose ring, which suggests I’m a hundred. Anyway. Maybe the rent won’t rise again if he realises he has bones.”

I thought about Tamsin and bones and a flight of steps and the way some legs make a noise when they stop being one piece. Rena drank from my glass with the sort of theft that is family. “He broke it,” I said, and the picture of someone tumbling down stairs touched the picture in my head that I usually keep under the cloth, and for a second the edges matched, and the room flashed dark as hands.

“I have to go,” Rena said, because she has always had to go, she has always been late because she is already on the next errand. She kissed my cheek, which is a trick of hers, and smelled of the same thing as ever: the underside of a cupboard and something like cloves. “Eat. Tell me you will.”

“I will,” I said, and she pat my face like I was a child and like she could move the bones under there with her palm, and then she was gone, taking the drone of bingo and the plastic purse and the noise of her breath with her.

I don’t know how to tell you about the night that wasn’t now, the night the stairs and the scarf and the way the house breathed wrong. Not yet. The brain makes history a secret because it thinks it’s making us safe. I went home with bread and milk and I put them on the counter like they had done a hard day’s work. I sat until they seemed like furniture. Then I ate, which made Rena win a small invisible point, and I washed up, and I stood with my head against the cold glass and watched the block opposite cough up a woman in a red coat, and my skin remembered another red, softer, and my hand hurt in a way that made it not my hand.

At night, the city tells stories into the drainpipes and up through the walls. A motorbike argues. A shout comes up from the corner and runs out of breath. A siren pulls its thread through the afternoon; the thread frays and is knotted by someone else’s kindness. My bed is too high. The dark had salted itself with the grey of fog, and there is a boat horn that only blows in the part of the evening where fear has its best boots on. You hear it and you think of leaving and you think of not, and both are the same weight. I fell asleep like a door with one hinge. I dreamed I was older than I could bear.

In the morning my phone had a message, short and impatient: You’re up? It was Tamsin. I answered yes because it seemed I had been for months. She replied: Pick me up in twenty? And an address I didn’t know and then knew, because this town doesn’t let you keep that privilege. It was near the estate where the corners are the same, near Marwick’s place, near the stairs and the nothing, near all the names we stopped using because they got tired.

I borrowed Kai’s car because he owed me, and because he wanted to be part of everything. “Don’t bleed in it,” he said. “I just cleaned the seats.” He grinned. I took the keys and when I turned the ignition the car started like it wanted to be a boat. The address sat in my head and the streets unrolled to meet it in the way they do, like you made them.

She was on the curb with a bag that looked too heavy and a face that looked like she could carry it. She opened the passenger door like she owned cars now. “You’re late,” she said.

“I’m on time,” I said.

“You’re late for me,” she said, which was a joke and not a joke. She put the bag in the back and then said, “We have to go to the warehouse on the industrial estate by the park. Don’t fall asleep.”

“You okay?” I said, because she didn’t look like she had had sleep either.

“Had a night,” she said, and her mouth did the thing where it pretends. “Marwick was being a twat. Now he’s a twat with a cast.”

“You were there,” I said, careful like you handle glass.

“And you know how he is when people tell him anything,” she said, and it was the Tamsin I knew, the one who can put knives in her laughter and make you cut yourself on it. “He said, I can carry these down, I’m not dead. I said, don’t. He said, do. The stairs said, no, thank you. Now you know the rest.”

“And the ambulance,” I said.

“You can watch the tapes,” she said. “You like that sort of thing. You can watch me not cry. He tried to blame me for gravity. I told him to go to hell because I am my mother’s daughter. I don’t think you ever liked him.”

“I never knew we were allowed not to,” I said.

“We are now,” she said. “Grow up.”

The car smelled like someone else’s work. She switched the radio on and off and on. “I might be,” she said. “I might be doing something new and something foolish.”

“You always are,” I said. The road let us pass and the water did that thing where it puts metal in your nose. We turned where the bed shops begin to fight with the furniture stores, where there are boxes on boxes and the whole of it looks like someone’s life mid-sorting. I looked at her hands on her lap and thought, I know those hands. I know their map. There is a scar on her right index where the fox that was a dog taught her about hunger. There is a whitened line on her wrist where she fell off the bike she stole from me in the April of the year we were terrible.

“Does it hurt?” I said, and she looked at me like I had picked up a stone that belonged to both of us.

“What,” she said.

“Carrying other people,” I said. “Weddings. Lifting boxes. Doing the being brave. Does it hurt or does it help.”

“Both,” she said. “Isn’t that the way of it.”

And then, before the warehouse, before the strong coffee, before the boxes of vases that look new but aren’t, before the woman in the office with the nice eyebrows and the anger, there was the sound. It came from the right, from the estate. It sounded like a bone giving up. Like a piece of furniture turning into words. She went still in the seat like she had learned that stillness is a language. I turned the car without thinking where the road would allow, and we were there in front of Marwick’s building which is not anyone’s name for it but we lend landlords our words.

At the bottom of the stairs was a man whose face had decided this wasn’t a day he owned. He wasn’t Marwick. He was the one who borrows a ladder and doesn’t return it. He had his hand on his shin and his shin was making angles that do not belong to shins. I looked, by accident, once. That is all it took. The world went into a narrow tube and the tube was a colour I don’t like, and my throat said, here we are again, and my hands said, we will be unhelpful now. The man swore, in ways I admired, and Tamsin said, “You stupid bastard,” and she ran to him and ran with a steadiness that is not mine.

She did not go gentle. She took my belt and put it round the man’s calf above where the wrongness was blooming, and she did it like she had spied on training and kept the notes. “You are not going to die,” she told the man. “You are not even going to get to enjoy morphine, because you do not deserve joy. I told you not to lug those options down by yourself.” She had her phone with the emergency line in it and she spoke into it like she was giving the orders to a kitchen.

I saw the belt, I saw the skin, I saw the shape of a leg that was now many legs. The air filled with the river sound that comes when my head has had enough. I held the metal railing and my knuckles tried to pretend they were bone. I could taste the side of a penny. A small part of me walked away and stood on the grass and explained to nobody that it was Sunday and that this was not right.

“Ellis,” said Tamsin without looking at me. She knows the chemical names of the storms in my blood. “Sit down. Put your head between your knees. You’re no use upright. You’re no use at all, but I do love you.”

I sat. The concrete had an opinion about my trousers. The man groaned and made noises that were not words and were not the wrong kind of quiet either. An old woman in a dressing gown flapped on the landing and gave me a stick of peppermint for no reason I could name. When the ambulance came, quicker than it does on television, the man who got out had a nose ring. Rena never lies. The woman with him had eyes that had seen every kind of night. Tamsin briefed them like she had employed them. The man with the nose ring looked at me just once and then stopped seeing me because I was background furniture like a cactus. It was a relief.

“Nice job,” said the woman with the eyes, to Tamsin, which made Tamsin stand taller for a second and then pretend to stoop. “You in the trade?”

“Not yet,” Tamsin said, and if ever a sentence had the feel of prophecy it was later, and I could not know it then.

They splinted the man. They did the things with straps that I cannot watch on television without walking out. They did not make more red in the world. They were kind the way people are when the kindness will cost them nothing. The man said his name was Arthur like that would help. The old woman cried as if she was practicing for something worse. When the lift of the stretcher made Tamsin put her hand to her face for the first time since it began, she did it with the back of her wrist, quick, a child.

After they left, after the little round of nothing that follows, the courtyard looked like a stage that had forgotten its plot. Tamsin lit the cigarette she’d been keeping and then didn’t smoke it. She looked at me like I might make a joke for her, and I didn’t. She said, “See? I told you. Gravity.”

“You okay,” I said, as if I had a right.

“Me? I am the picture of health,” she said. “You, on the other hand, look like someone wrung you out.” She touched my shoulder. “Why do you keep doing this to yourself.”

“I don’t choose it,” I said, and the wind stood up between us like it had something to say. “Do you remember—”

“No,” she said, and I shut my mouth because she had put the word up like a wall and painted it with a threat. “Don’t, Ellis. Not yet. You’ve always had a way of opening things that need to sit shut. We can do that in a room, with biscuits, when I’ve slept.”

“Okay,” I said, and I placed the word obedient on my tongue and let it dissolve.

We went to the warehouse like it was what normal people do after a man’s leg decided to be two. The day kept going, because it does, because nobody asked if we were okay with that. The boxes were heavy. The woman with the eyebrows admired a set of plates as if money were an emotion. Tamsin told her a schedule and I watched her build a day out of sentences in a way that made my chest ache. I thought about a piece of paper and a scarf and stairs and breath and the way your brain tells you something and then takes it back. Did I say I killed her? Not aloud. Not yet. The word killed is not a light word where we are. It hangs around your neck like a job.

When I took her back to the address, the steps were clean now, which was a miracle I understood. She said, “Same again tomorrow,” and I said yes because I am a yes person until I am not. She leaned into the car, her face inside the window but her feet still on the world, and she said, very soft and very ordinary, like it was what we do, “You know I should be dead,” and then she shut the door with my answer still in my throat and went up the stairs with the kind of speed that comes from not wanting to hear the response.

I drove to the sea with the windows cracked and the radio chewing old songs. The gulls had a committee meeting and didn’t invite me. The tide put its tongue out at the wall. When I closed my eyes, the sound of bone turning itself into sticks played and played like a song stuck on, even though I hadn’t seen the worst of it. You can smell pain in the air; it’s not a lie people tell to make themselves feel interesting. It smells like the last cupboard in the kitchen you didn’t open. It smells like pennies.

I slept badly and dreamed worse. When I woke, there was a taste in my mouth that had a time attached to it: ten years exactly, or nine and some change, a New Year with the cheap rockets going off over the Common, a night the frost drew patterns on the cars like white flowers that don’t live. I could not help it. The cloth lifted. The stairs came. The scarf. Her laugh like a knife you intend for bread. The push that can be a joke until it isn’t. The sound a body makes when it meets the hard. The sound that is not someone else’s bone, not Arthur’s, not Marwick’s. The sound that is the shape of guilt. It was me. My hands. My clumsy and my anger and my inability to be anyone else. I had not known how to carry anything. I had made myself into a person who drops things when he sees red because once I dropped someone.

And then, like the tide taking pity, the memory took itself back again and left me with only the after-taste and the sweat. My hands were my hands again. Somebody was shouting outside in a voice that belongs to bins. My kettle changed the subject with its thin scream. I stood there in the small kitchen and watched water become more itself and thought, I am not safe from the past, but maybe I can be stubborn in the present. Maybe I can bunk off my own head for a day or two.

I texted Tamsin: Tea? That was all. The word had worked for us before. The word might be a boat.

She sent back: After work. Big day. The sort where I break things. And a kiss that I could pretend meant nothing.

I turned the tap and let the water run until it stopped smelling of pipes. The city outside was already arguing with its own noises and I had another day to go and be a person who doesn’t faint and do a job I might not keep and love people I maybe can’t afford. The fear was awake. The memory was not fully. The gulls began again. The day stood up.

In the mirror over the sink I made my face say, we carry on. It doesn’t look like me when I do it. That was fine. I didn’t need to be me to survive. I only needed to be someone who could wait in the noise until the next piece of the story arrived.The morning after the kettle changed the subject, I went back to Templar’s because wages are a thing even if dignity is not. The sky was a lid and the gulls were already arguing with the bins like they were owed an apology by plastic. I told myself I would go, I would stand in the steam of ice and bleach for ten minutes, I would say thank you to a man who thinks saying less is a leadership style, and then I would leave without knocking over anything that cuts. The bell above the door rattled like loose teeth and the cold air inside carried the comfort of wrong choices you know by heart. Hobb was at the back with the books, licking his finger as if money needs tasting. He glanced up and did a whole conversation with his eyebrows about how long I had taken, then remembered I was doing him a favour by existing only briefly.

He slid an envelope across like it might explode if he made a bigger movement. It had the weight of Thursdays and the lightness of all the other days. Kai leaned his elbows on the counter and made a face that wanted to be sympathetic and ended up being sunny because that is his only coat. “You all right?” he said, as if we had had a different week.

“I’m fine,” I said, and the word did what it always does, stood in for a yes and hid a no like a coin in a shoe. “You still a man who lends cars?”

“I’m a man who collects favours like bottle caps,” he said, grinning. “You still going to marry the sea if no one stops you? Watch yourself, she bites.” He slid me my last bacon roll on the house like he was commemorating something, and for a second we were boys and then we weren’t.

Hobb cleared his throat as if a small bird had got stuck in the pipes. “And the key,” he said, picking at a ledger corner with a nail that looked like it had been cut with anger. “And your apron. And if you could resist writing a poem about it all over the internet, that’d be grand.”

“I don’t have the internet,” I said, and it was almost true, and it made Kai snort into his sleeve. The key went heavy into his palm like the end of a story you’ve been reading and pretending you don’t mind the last page. I wanted to say something like sorry, like thank you, like I am not as useless as I look, but those sentences require a spine I couldn’t find this morning, so I said, “Good luck for Christmas,” and turned into the air.

Outside the day was trying to be a bright thing and succeeding for the rich. Mrs. Carrow walked past with her bag-for-life that had given up and become a bag-for-now, and she said, “Ellis,” in a way that told me she had a list of gripes ready for whoever had hands. I nodded and dodged on instinct, and then I nearly walked into the thin man in the brave blue suit. He had the expression of a person who knows what he looks like in a reflection and prefers it to reality.

“Morning,” he said, the word warm and watchful. “We keep bumping.”

“We don’t,” I said, then softened because his tie had tried so hard and failed. “What do you want me for?” The envelope in my pocket trembled like a small animal.

“Witness statements,” he said, and I hated that the shape of his mouth could make the shape of trouble so polite. “About Mr. Marwick’s little flight. Liability, see. The Council like to pretend steps are no one’s responsibility until a man’s leg reminds them of gravity. I’ve got a form that says you can put your name down as a person who saw. And your… friend—Miss Keen—she’ll need to talk to me too. Off the record, of course. Nothing to worry yourself with. I’m just collecting truths, the way the sea collects glass.”

The word friend stuck in my ear and made itself a bed. I wanted to tell him that truths are not bottle caps and people are not shelves, but then I remembered that he knew Tamsin from school and probably believed that knowing was the same as owning. “I didn’t see anything until it was already a mess,” I said, careful with the edges. “The ambulance saw more than I did.”

He nodded like he knew how memory works and had watched it crumble in good light. “Always the way. Look, don’t be a stranger. I’m with Dalloway & Sons on the corner. We do the grim things so other people can keep their hands clean. Tell Tamsin I asked after her. She’s a firework, that one.” He smiled his poor borrowed smile and drifted away, leaving the smell of aftershave that wanted to be a yacht.

I took the long route back along the water, because the water will have me even when people won’t. The ferries made their slow declarations out of harbour, and I watched them the way men watch each other’s shoulders in a bar fight. There is a lesson in the way something huge can move with that much grace if you stop insisting on going where streets tell you. I considered the number for the GP pinned to the cork board by the kettle at home, a paper that had been there so long even the drawing pin had a groove. The last time I called, the receptionist had a voice that thought I might be making sickness up for attention, and I had hung up before she could offer me an appointment in March. I rehearsed it again: hello, a problem with blood, vasovagal, yes I know the word, no I don’t want to waste your time, yes I am doing the breathing, no I am not getting better and if anything I am turning into a man-shaped faint. The seagulls heckled like old men against benches. A child licked a lamppost to see if it would freeze his tongue, and his sister watched like a scientist. The world stays stupid, which is sometimes a blessing.

At midday, with a heat that wasn’t really heat under the pale sun, I took Rena to the GP because she has a particular way of losing appointments unless someone stands at her elbow and reminds her she is loved. She hates lifts because they do their work while looking smug, so we took the stairs and she swore at each one as if naming them was going to make them fall out with their own legs. The waiting room was full of the particular variety of chairs that punish you for sitting wrong. A man coughed as if he wanted to expel his own past. A poster about bowel cancer had a cartoon intestine on it with eyes, and Rena tutted and said, “Not everything needs a face.”

She pinched my cheek the way you pinch dough to see if it will rise and then peered at me in the brighter light from the window. “You look like you slept in a sentence,” she said. “Not even a good one. You should put your name on the list. Talk to a person in a cardigan about how your head likes to play dead. It’s free unless you want it to work.”

“I know,” I said, watching a nurse who was too young to carry that much tired. “I will.”

“You won’t,” she said, and she was both wrong and my mother. “Your man with the nose ring saved Arthur, by the way. He came back later with forms and a smile and you know I don’t trust a smile on a Tuesday, but I trusted that one. He told me there’s a course you can do, to learn to do the holding and the pressing without making more of a mess. Community responders. Looks good on a CV, he said, as if mine isn’t already an opera. I told him I was too old, and he said people don’t stop bleeding just because you’re seventy-one.”

Rena has a way of giving me my next hour without asking if it fits. I filed the words away under maybe, like you do for chores you suspect might save your life. A woman with a baby sat down opposite and the baby stared at me with the rudeness of the new. I pulled a face and the baby solemnly pulled one back, and for a moment I felt exactly the right size for the room. Rena nodded to herself because she likes me better when children don’t cry.

We got her seen and we got her prescriptions and we got out before the walls could start swapping names, and I took her home to her flat where the carpets smell of boiled cabbage even on days no one has seen a cabbage for months. She showed me the plant she’s keeping alive by arguing with it and told me to go and be in the world and not supervise her, because she didn’t need me to watch her make a sandwich as if the bread might leave. “Six,” she said as I went, a number without a noun attached. “You coming to mine to watch the quiz and shout the answers like a smug parrot. I bought a cake that tastes of lemon if lemon was poor.”

“I’ll be there,” I said, and she kissed the side of my head as if I had earned it.

Tamsin sent me a voice note at two. She does that because texts make her impatient and calls make her feel like she is performing. It had the sound of wind and feet and her breath doing that fast thing that is not quite panic and not quite joy. “If you’re not doing anything except staring at water and bothering old ladies, I need a pair of hands at the Waverley. The couple have decided the chair bows are the wrong white and I need someone to pretend to be useful while I murder a ribbon supplier with my mind. Also you can carry boxes. There might be canapés in it for you. And you owe me one for not letting you lick the pavement at Arthur’s. Twenty minutes.”

The Waverley is a hotel that acts like it could be in a better city. It does its best. Its lobby has a carpet you could get lost in and a piano that has forgotten what a tune is, and the staff glide like they took ballet once and decided to keep the posture. I found Tamsin near a pyramid of champagne coupes that looked like a dare. She wore a shirt that made her look like she knew where the exits were and her hair in a knot like a sailor. She saw me and did a version of a wave that seemed to think waves were for other people.

“Right,” she said, handing me a crate that was heavier than it looked. “Upstairs. Don’t look at the bride unless she talks to you. Don’t tell anyone your last job. Don’t faint. If you do, do it somewhere photogenic.” She took three boxes herself and walked with that easy authority of someone who has just decided she knows what she’s doing and hopes no one argues before the decision settles.

The function room was all white around the edges, as if someone had erased its history, and in the middle was a mess that only money can make. Flowers lay everywhere like wounded. Men in narrow trousers argued about chair placement as if chairs are political. The bride stood with a look I have seen on men in court, a look that says the day is too large and too delicate at the same time. Tamsin marched past it all, issuing calm, pretending that control is a substance you can hand out by the ounce. I followed, relegated to a moving backdrop, which is my comfort.

We tied sashes, which is a work of theology in this town; people will go to war over a bow. We laid cutlery in a way that pretends knives have never done harm. We faked an ease that must have looked convincing because the bride eventually unclenched enough to cry and laugh in one movement and asked if she was a terrible person, which is the thing all brides ask when they have spent the morning commanding chandeliers. Tamsin did her voice like balm and told her she was a perfect monster, which is to say perfect, and the woman laughed in relief and went to be painted again.

It was going to be almost fine, and then the groom’s uncle cut his finger on a box of wine because justice likes to play small jokes. It was nothing as far as the body is concerned, a nick where a flap of skin looks like it wants to be dramatic and then thinks better of it. For me it was a note from a song I try not to remember. He held up his hand to the light like he was auditioning for a saint, and for a second the red said hello in the middle of the white, and the room narrowed to a tunnel that made the hotel into a ship. I felt my neck go cold and my fingers lose the plot. The glass stem in my palm felt like a throat.

“Ellis,” said Tamsin, without looking, as if we had rehearsed this in secret. Her voice pressed a hand to the back of my head and pushed my gaze away from the colour. “String lights. The ones in the crate. Behind you, left. Go be clever with electricity.” She was already moving toward the uncle, already having a plaster appear out of air, already commandeering a waiter’s black napkin as a bandage and a prop. Her hands did the thing hands do when they’ve seen worse and made it better. I turned and walked like I had been told how, and the string lights were a patient animal who didn’t know where its head was. I breathed the way the internet says you should, in on four, out on six, pretending to blow on a match. The world un-tunneled. The uncle made a joke about being a martyr and declared himself in love with Tamsin and his wife did not argue because some loves are only allowed for emergencies.

After the ceremony, which happened with the right amount of tears and none of the wrong, we stood by the kitchen door and ate the offcuts of vol-au-vents like stray dogs. Tamsin chewed and leaned her head on the wall, closing her eyes in that way that means she is checking something inside is still there. “I like this part,” she said. “This feeling like you’ve [held] everything together with string and gum and then no one sees the string. It’s like… I don’t know. It’s like when you used to balance on the wall by the little park and I would hold my hand a centimetre from your back and you’d swear you could feel it even if I wasn’t touching. That.”

“You could have been a surgeon,” I said, watching a chef swear in French to a pan that was definitely English. “Or a general. Or God.”

“Too much paperwork,” she said, and then, with her mouth full, “Do you know I wrote to the ambulance place. The nose ring man—Adam—told me they do those courses. He said if you’re good at bossing people kindly and you don’t mind lifting weird things at three in the morning, you can be one of them. I said I mind blood and he said everyone does until they don’t.”

“You love blood,” I said, and she made a face as if she was the one with the phobia.

“I love being the person who decides what it means,” she said. “That’s not the same thing. Weddings are all triage when you think about it. Only with lace.” She licked pastry off her thumb and saw me look and hid her hand like a trick. “You could do it,” she said, and I laughed, because she is funny.

“They don’t want someone who keels over at the sight of a raspberry,” I said. “I could drive the ambulances and vomit out the window.”

“You underestimate how much they need drivers,” she said. “And how brave it is to be the person who holds the door open without fainting in it.” Her face went strange for a second, soft and wicked at once. “Also. You have a nice voice on the phone. You could talk a man out of dying just by telling him about the weather.”

In the lull between speeches and dancing, in that awkward hour where the men who eat too fast take off their ties and the bridesmaids discover their shoes are not loyal, Tamsin dragged me into a side corridor that smelled of bleach and hotel secrets. The lights hummed. She pushed a door that said Staff and we went into a room full of folded tablecloths that looked like sleeping ghosts. She shut the door with her heel and leaned on it, looking at me like she had walked a long way with a question on her head.

“Do you remember the scarf,” she said, and she said it as if the word had a wire in it.

“I do,” I said, though the truth is I remember it like you remember a dream someone else told you. “Red. You said I looked poor in it.” The room tilted almost invisibly. I felt the part of my brain that keeps the cloth begin to fidget.

“I said you were poor,” she said, and her smile fought with itself until it lost. “Which was true, but I meant mean. I meant mean like withholding. I was horrible. I was being the person I thought I had to be to not be eaten. You looked at me like a dog looks at a hand with rings on it.” She rubbed at the scar on her wrist like she was polishing a memory. “I keep thinking if I start it, if I pick up one thread, then the rest will come and we’ll know if we’re supposed to hate each other or just buy a cake.”

“Cake is cheaper,” I said, and then the atmosphere in the cupboard of linens strangled my joke for me. “I think I pushed you,” I said, because I am the man who fills silences with knives. “Or I think I didn’t and I’m choosing the story where I did because it gives me someone to punish. I remember the stairs and I remember the sound and I remember your laugh like a blade and that scarf and then I remember nothing until years had passed and you were not dead.”

“Not dead is one of my better tricks,” she said, and the corner of her mouth lifted with old spite. “It wasn’t that. It was later. It was… no, not here. Not with confetti like dandruff outside this door. It was not you, and also I am not letting you off that easy. You were a bastard that winter. You were so careful with your kindness that I thought you had none. You wanted me to deserve your attention, like a prize. I was used to a different kind of cruelty. Yours was new. You know this.”

“I was nineteen,” I said, like it was an excuse, and she snorted.

“We were all nineteen,” she said. “Some of us made it to twenty without pretending to be statues.” She reached and touched my face with two fingers, quick as if she was turning off a radio. “You didn’t kill me,” she said, and it was the simplest sentence in the room. “You didn’t. You might have wanted to for a second because I was unbearable, but you didn’t. I am alive by accident and stubbornness and a nurse who yelled at me, and that’s a story for a bus stop, not a hotel. Get out of the cupboard before I make out with you because the place where fabric is folded is our ancestral home.”

We went back to the noise, and I carried plates and watched her keep people from discovering disappointment. The band played Brown Eyed Girl because things like that must be endured, and the father of the bride cried into his own pocket because all men are five when it comes to letting go. We finished at eleven and slid through the service entrance like thieves, and the night outside had a texture like breath on skin. She leaned against the brick, letting the cold steal the heat from her back, and lit the cigarette she had been storing behind her ear since the Common. She didn’t smoke it. She just watched it burn and go out and held it like a wand that could make the day stop if she shook it hard enough.

We went to Rena’s like children, because she said six and it was nine and she’d pretend to be cross and then put a piece of lemon cake in our hands regardless. Her flat was warm as turnips and crowded with the kind of rubbish only love keeps. The quiz shouted and the kettle did its war cry and Rena said, “You got thinner and prettier and I don’t like either,” and then kissed us both as if we were her idea. We sat on her rug and ate cake that tasted like it wanted to be forgiven. Rena asked how many bones are in the ear as if we were in a bet, and Tamsin made up numbers with the authority of a minister.

In the adverts, a voice chirped about washing away blood in a way that made both Rena and me swear in stereo. Rena muted it by hitting the remote like a rat. “Did I ever tell you about the time your mum cut her thumb trying to be a hero with a tin of peaches,” she said, and I said yes because she tells this one in winter. “She bled like it was a show and then laughed because she’d made a mess on my new towel, and then she went white and fell down like a girl in a Victorian novel. Only time I ever seen her do it. She said, I’ve been waiting years to get away with fainting. She said, don’t be greedy with your drama, Rena. I told her I’d be greedy for both of us. God, I miss that cow.”

We did not look directly at sadness. We watched it from the side like a train. Tamsin had a way of holding her mug that made me think she had been holding something hot for a long time and her skin had adapted. She put her head on Rena’s shoulder and Rena rolled her eyes because she thinks affection is a trick, but she didn’t move away. “There’s a man,” Rena said into Tamsin’s hair, without preamble or permission. “He works at the docks. He came round asking after you. I said who wants to know and he said a man with paperwork, which is not a name. I told him to go to church. He’s got that look like he could sell you a sofa, only the sofa would belong to someone else.”

“Insurance,” I said, and both women winced like I had said dentist. “For the steps. He wants witnesses with neat pens. He thinks the truth is tidy if you put it in boxes.”

Tamsin made a face that said she could take a box and make it a hat. “We can give him what he needs and not what he wants,” she said. “I’m good at that. I have a degree in it. He can ask me what I saw, and I will say, I saw a man think he was bigger than friction. I saw a town that needs new stairs. I saw myself tell him no and be ignored. I did not see God.”

When I walked home, the night had put fog on and the lamplight made cones like a cheap show. My flat was there like it had been every day I was missing, and on the mat was a leaflet Rena had pushed under earlier when she wasn’t pretending to have respect for boundaries. It said NHS in a polite blue and had a photo of a woman listening to a man as if he was more interesting than anyone else had ever been, and the headline said Talking Helps in a tone that could make a grown man cry. There were numbers. There were promises. There was the suggestion that you should not have to pay to be told you’re not mad.

I put it in the drawer where elastic bands go to die and then I took it back out because I have learned that ignoring paper does not make paper less sharp. The kettle shrieked and I let it. The flat breathed in its creaks. Somewhere a car alarm declared war on nobody. I gave myself the small obedience of filling in a form. It asked me to rate my sadness from one to ten like sadness is a service. It asked if I had thoughts that were unkind to myself and I ticked a box as if that could make a difference to the way my heart does its work. It told me someone would call within two weeks and I thought two weeks is a way to describe forever.

Sleep came in chapters and left between them. I woke to a message from Adam, the nose ring paramedic, because Rena is a woman who can get numbers out of anybody without paying. He wrote like a person who has no time to fuss and some time to care. There’s a community responder training on Wednesday at the community centre by the lido, his message said. No blood. Just maps and pads and how to talk to people’s fear. You’d be good at the talking. Bring someone who likes to argue with chairs if you want. He put a smiley and then killed it with a full stop.

I stared at the line about no blood until it felt like a dare. I screenshotted it and sent it to Tamsin with a question mark like a teenager. She sent back a thumbs up and then, after a beat, a second thumbs up because she has never known when to leave well enough alone. I put the phone down on the counter and watched it glow like a small, smug fish.

The day did what days do; it arrived whether I wanted it or not. I went to the harbour and I let the cold make my fingers ache into their own shapes. I watched a ship come in looking like a cardboard cut-out until it got close enough to have teeth. A boy kicked a ball against a wall that did not care and I wanted to tell him to kick a different way but then I thought perhaps he would find it for himself and resent me less. My feet took me toward North End without asking if that was clever, and I found myself standing outside Dalloway & Sons looking at a cardboard accident in the window. The poster had a man lying under an oversimplified car, smiling because that makes it all right, and under him the words said We Make It Easier To Heal, which is a lie and also what you want to hear.

Inside, the man in the wrong blue suit looked up and his face lit like a shop train set. “Ellis,” he said, as if we were children who had met at the swings. “You came in of your own free will. That’s rare and therefore valuable.”

“I came to tell you to leave Rena alone,” I said, because I had misjudged my own courage and now I had words and nowhere to put them. “And to take my name off whatever list you have that says I saw anything useful. I didn’t. I saw a man on a floor decide to become a problem and then got told to sit down by a woman who has earned the right to say that forever. Write that on your form.”

He folded his hands and looked like a person who prides himself on not blinking. “I grew up in a town where if you didn’t tell the truth early, someone else told it for you,” he said. “I’m not the bad man here, Ellis. I’m trying to get the Council to look at what it has been ignoring since the eighties. It helps my client and it helps your mother and it helps the old woman in the housecoat who thinks peppermint fixes legs. If I have a letter with three names on it, the stairs might get fixed and you might not have to watch another shin try to make a right angle. Help me put a weight on the scale.”

He had put the word mother in his mouth like a match and blown on it. I wanted to lift a chair and throw it at his soft face and then I wanted to go home and put my head under the pillow until there were no stairs left. “Rena isn’t my mother,” I said, and then because that sounded like betrayal I added, “She is. She’s the kind that counts. And if those steps get fixed because you got signatures, I’ll sign. But you don’t go to her flat like you want tea. You send a letter like a person who knows doors are ladders.”

He nodded, slowly, and for a second the wrong blue suit looked right on him because he had remembered he was a person inside it. “I’ll send letters,” he said. “Bring Miss Keen to the training if you can. The paramedics like converts. And tell her I still think she should have been captain of the netball team even if she didn’t go to practice.”

“Go to hell,” I said, kindly, and he laughed in a way that made me consider not hating him for five minutes.

On Wednesday, we went to the community centre with its smell of old chlorine and biscuits. The room had a dozen chairs and a line of mannequins without faces lying on the floor like a quiet crime. A woman with hair like authority stood at the front and talked about how hearts lie and lungs want persuading and how fear is a thing you can talk to as if it’s a badly behaved dog. Adam stood at the back with his arms folded and his nose ring making a small, defiant star, and he nodded at me like we had saved a life between us which is generous.

We learned where to put our hands without breaking ribs and how to count without the numbers running away. We learned to peel the back off sticky pads with more confidence than I thought I had left. We learned to say “I am here” in a tone that does not make things worse. Tamsin rolled her eyes at all of it and then executed compressions with a seriousness that made the room take a breath, as if it had been waiting for someone to treat the plastic like a person. When it was my turn, the fake chest was cold and my arms shook and my mind tried to go to the red place and I made it stay. Adam crouched next to me and said, “You’re doing it. Don’t think about whether you can. You are,” and it was the kind of sentence that might have saved me at sixteen if anyone had thought to say it.

After, we stood outside and the sky had that particular Portsmouth purple that is made of sodium lamps and doubt. Tamsin bounced on the balls of her feet because she can’t keep still when her brain is pleased. “I liked the part where it worked,” she said, grinning in a way that made me want to lie down on the pavement and declare myself done. “I liked the part where the machine told you what to do and everyone stopped pretending they don’t need machines. I liked the part where you didn’t fall over. You see. You can be in a room with the idea of death and not punish yourself.”

“It was plastic,” I said, but the protest came from far away. “It didn’t have blood.”

“It had a chest,” she said. “The rest we can compromise on.” She looped her arm through mine like we were at school and she’d just stolen a biscuit and wanted me to run. “Tomorrow,” she said, and there it was again, a promise without details. “I’ll tell you about the not-dead. You can tell me about the boat. We’ll be kind and we’ll be wrong, and then we’ll be right. And then we’ll eat chips. There’s a plan if I ever heard one.”

At home that night, I took the leaflet out of the elastic band drawer and put it on the fridge with the magnet that says Southsea is Not a Phase in a font someone thought was clever. The kettle sang because that is its only party trick. The pipes muttered and the walls learned my name again. The stairs in my head did not go away, but they had dust on them now like things that have been left in lofts, and perhaps I could climb them without breaking. The city made its noises and each one I let be itself. In the morning, the gulls would start and the post would bring letters addressed to the boys we used to be and we would send them back or open them or burn them and either way, we would be here. The day stood just over the horizon like a man thinking about a dive. I stood in my kitchen and practiced saying, I am here, in a voice that did not tremble. The mirror over the sink looked at me as if I had lied and decided to forgive me anyway.In the morning the wind came up the street as if it had somewhere else to be and was offended to find me in its way. The kettle watched me the way a suspicious aunt watches a party, clucking under its breath, and when it boiled I poured and forgot to drink because my mouth was busy rehearsing an apology for something that hadn’t happened yet. The city wore its weekday face, all fluorescent jackets and early arguments and the kind of laughter that comes from the throat because the head is still asleep. I put on the coat that thinks it’s bigger than me and texted Tamsin that I would be at the front with small coins and patience. She sent back a single fish, then the knife emoji by accident, then an apology made of a dolphin. I put my mug in the sink in the way that says to yourself you’ll deal with the cup’s feelings later, and I went out into a day that had already started without me.

Chips smell a certain way on a wind that comes from the east; there’s vinegar in it, and fat that has learned to admit it’s going to live forever, and the sour of paper that’s been damp more than once. The hut on the front had a queue like a sermon. The boy inside had hair that would cut your fingers if you touched it. I ordered two and said yes to salt because no is a joke we don’t tell in this town when offered anything warm. I sat with my back to the wall because I am that kind of animal now and I watched the water pretend to be mild. A gull landed on the bin and gave me the look that says, I know your address. When Tamsin arrived, she came in sideways like she was overtaking the air. She had a scar on her knuckle I hadn’t catalogued and trainers that made a case for comfort as a political position.

“You look like you didn’t sleep,” she said, pleased, which is how you know the people who know you. “Give me that. I’m going to eat it wrong and offend the fish.”

“Join the committee,” I said, handing her the hotter paper. “I have a list of things I’m not sleeping about if you want to trade.”

“I never trade,” she said, blowing on a chip as if it would listen. “I hoard and then pretend I divvied. You ready for the horror story or shall we talk about sauces first.”

“Sauces won’t help,” I said, and the gull made a sound as if it agreed. “You said not-dead. You said nurse. You said later. I’ve been introducing those words to each other in my head and they keep eloping.”

“It’s not glamour,” she said, and the tone of it told me that what followed would be a plain room with a bright light and not the costume drama my fear has paid for. “It wasn’t a knife-wielding spectre or a romantic illness. It was a bike. Of course it was a bike. This town breeds the urge to be on two wheels and too fast because the roads are small and nobody respects how big their car is. I was twenty-one and I had a job at a place where they pretend to be surprised when you return a dress with the tags still on. I was late, because I was always late, because I thought being on time meant they owned you. The mirror on the bus on Eastern Road had ideas about how much space its elbow needed. It tapped me in a way that would have been flirtatious if it weren’t metal, and I introduced my whole self to the tarmac.”

She said it like a list, but the space between the words had black ice in it. She licked salt off her thumb and looked at the water so that I could look at her without getting in trouble. “I don’t remember the first bit,” she said. “I remember thinking, oh, I am sideways, and then I was under a cloud that was a siren and someone said my name right. The nurse was a woman of an age where she had no patience for you thinking you were the first to try dying. She said my name like she was swatting a fly. She said, stay here. She said, open your eyes. She said, if you go to sleep you’re going to make me shout and I’ve had a day of shouting. She kept me going with rage. I liked her for that. The paramedic had brown eyes and a ring in his nose and he had hands like the underside of a boat, and he said nothing dramatic, he just said, I’m here, with the calm of someone who’s already seen the drama go wrong elsewhere. My head did its private bleeding in places you can’t put a plaster, and then it stopped, because it decided to. I should be dead, by the numbers, if the bus had loved me more, if the ground had been ice, if the woman in the nurse shoes had been less tired. I am not dead because of physics and a person who refused to let my eyes close. It wasn’t you. You weren’t near. You were probably looking at water, being an arse.”

“I am often being an arse,” I said, and felt my insides move round to make space for this new furniture. “So it’s a story about a bus and a woman with a voice that doesn’t forgive. Good. I can be jealous of both without being complicated.”

“It’s a story about how death is boring, mostly,” she said. “It’s a story about the way a town can try to kill you with its elbows and fail. It’s a story about how after that, I thought, well, if something is going to get me it had its chance and it was clumsy. It made me bold in a stupid way for a year and then it made me careful. More boring. You’d have liked me. I didn’t shout at strangers in shops. I set alarms. I bought better helmets. It’s not a story for a book. It’s a line.”

“It is a story for a book,” I said, offended on its behalf. “It goes like this: a woman met an ordinary disaster and decided to be extraordinary at not dying. That’s a plot.”

She snorted and stole the end of my sausage like a sibling. “Tell me yours,” she said with her mouth full, rude. “Not the blood. I don’t care to audit your syncope. The other one. The stairs. You’re carrying it like a child carries an egg to school and you’ve got yolk on your jeans.”

“You said later,” I said, stalling badly. “You said not here, not then. You said bus stop.”

“This is a bus stop for the rich,” she said, nodding at the shelter where a woman in sunglasses pretended to read a timetable. “We can start or we can wait and let it rot and go soft and then it will leak. Your choice.”

“I don’t know enough to tell it,” I said, miserable with the accuracy. “When I try, the memory puts me in a lift between floors and pipes the same song in from both sides. There’s the scarf. There’s your laugh that wasn’t kind that day. There’s me being nineteen and useless. There’s a noise that belongs to bone and floor and the part of my brain that likes to punish me has put it on loop and told me it’s you. There’s a second version where we both stumbled, and then the cut scene, and then I’ve made a person out of guilt and he sleeps in my bed. I don’t know which I’m more afraid of, that I did it or that I didn’t and I chose to wear it for fashion.”

She finished the chips like a woman who has to leave no evidence and folded the paper with more care than it deserved. “You didn’t kill me,” she said again, not holy, just sure. “You did not. You were a bastard and a boy and you let me run the knife too far because you liked watching me be sharp. You didn’t push. We were loud. We were not sober enough to be doing stairs. We frightened the wall. There was a bruise that looked like a continent. There was a week where I told everyone I had been mugged by gravity because it made a better story than, I was an idiot with a friend. There is later to talk about. There are rooms we haven’t built yet for the talking. But not this, El. Find another coat if you need to be cold. Not this one.”

I hadn’t known that words could be analgesic in that exact way, dulling one pain while leaving the rest deliciously raw. I breathed and the world came back with it. The gull on the bin screamed at a child because that’s how you teach the young. The water did a thing with the light that was not for us. Tamsin dug into her pocket and produced a crumpled receipt covered in numbers that could be time or money and wrote the name ADAM on the back in a hand that talks too loud. “Wednesday,” she said. “We’ll go to the thing where they teach you how to press without breaking and how to talk without lying. You can be the bit of the team that keeps people in their own bodies. It’s a skill. We’ll be the kind of citizens people put on leaflets. You can sign your name to the hellman’s man after if you like, get your stairs saved. I’ll choose us where I can.”

When she is forgiving, it feels like you are the right size for the doorway. When she is commanding, it feels like being told to breathe by a person who knows more about breathing than you do. We walked along the front until the wind had finished with us, past a dog with a jumper knitted by love and a man selling hats even the hats were embarrassed by. She took a phone call in which someone at a venue declared that white comes in seventeen shades and she resisted explaining the existence of light. I stood near a bin and was human until the call ended, and then we were ourselves again, which is harder and better.

That afternoon a man came to put tape across the steps where Arthur rehearsed disaster and the tape was the particular yellow that wants to be crime and settles for caution. The tape sagged in the middle like hope. A child peeled a corner and her mother smacked the air next to her hand instead of the hand itself, which is a little genius Rena invented years ago. Dalloway & Sons had sent letters and the letters had the tone of a man who once wore a prefect’s badge and is now paid to correct you gently. Rena had hers on the table under a lemon and said, “We’re being consulted,” like a complaint and also like she knew the importance of being seen even if the seeing is done with clipboards. She had her knees up on a second chair because the doctor had said to rest them and she was obeying in the way that is still an argument. “I’ll sign,” she said, because she likes to be useful. “I’ll say I saw a man think he was better than stairs and the stairs say no. I’ll say fix the stairs and fix the man and fix the part of this town that thinks people are too cheap to save.”

We took her to the surgery to get the injection that would clean the edges of her pain without making promises it couldn’t keep. The nurse there had the eyes of someone who collects spoons and stories. She swabbed and tapped and stabbed and Rena swore in the old language that isn’t a language at all, and I nearly went sideways because the reality of the needle made my head overconfident. The nurse kept talking to me as if I were the patient and to Rena as if she were the accomplice. “You breathe,” she said to me, which is a cruel thing to remind a body to do. “You don’t look. You look at me and you tell me what you had for breakfast and you lie well.” I told her about toast that had not existed and she rewarded me with a nod that did more for my blood than the glucose tablets in my pocket. Rena flexed like a woman showing off an engine. She said, “I was very brave,” and the nurse said, “You were tolerable,” and wrote something down as if the pen needed the exercise.

A week turned itself into several without permission, the way weeks do when you hang too many jobs on them and none of the jobs are called stop. I signed the paper for the stairs with the same biro I use for lists about milk and lies, and the Dalloway man phoned to say thank you in a way that meant keep going. The tape became a scaffold and the scaffold became proper steps, and the day they took the scaffold down three boys slid on the edges in celebration and Arthur shouted at them from the window like a bell. Tamsin booked three weddings in rooms that smelled of carpet shampoo and hope and one on a patch of grass by Canoe Lake where an old man fed swans and we were all a little afraid of him. I went to the community centre on Wednesdays and let Adam teach me about geography and premise more than he taught me about blood. He told me the slang the ambulance uses for the half-awake half-dead, for the street names people who weren’t born here can’t pronounce, for the ways bodies lie to you when they want attention. He said, “Say I am here even when you’re not sure you are,” and I did, and sometimes I was.

The first time the pager went off in my pocket I nearly threw it into the harbour on reflex because it made a noise like a terrified insect. It buzzed and this is the thing phones no longer do; it assumed I could read information under pressure. The message said COPD, male, late seventies, breathless, and then a street I knew too well to need the postcode. I texted Tamsin the way you text when adrenaline sews your hands together, and she sent back, on my way, like we had been doing this for years. We met outside a house that had once been a shop and now was four flats and none of them had curtains that fit. A woman in a dressing gown opened the door and let us in the way a mother lets damp into a kitchen; helplessly, with ceremony. There on the sofa was a man the shape of a coat on a hanger, chest hitching like a hiccup had gone wrong. His name had four letters and three of them were tired.

I did the thing they taught us about kneeling so your voice is a place and not a problem. I said my name, which is always the first bridge, and he said his as if he was apologising for choosing a small one. The room smelled of dust and that plastic Tube smell you get from a new kettle. Tamsin found the inhalers without asking permission because she has learned that permission is not necessary when someone can’t remember how to say yes. I counted with him, long in, longer out, and he glared at me the way people glare at metronomes. The noise in my pocket said the ambulance was three minutes and that’s a lie those noises tell to keep you brave, but they weren’t far off. We didn’t change the world. We kept him in it. When Adam came in with his machine and his kindness and his too-cool ring and put the mask on and the numbers began to behave, he looked at me and said, “Good voice,” and the part of me that is twelve did a handspring.

“I like the quiet ones,” the man’s wife said at the door, pressing a packet of custard creams into my palm like a medal. “The ones who don’t need to narrate. You can come again when we do funerals. We do them on Thursdays.”

“Save it for a Wednesday,” said Tamsin, pocketing the biscuits as tax. “He likes a schedule.” The old woman snorted and shut the door on our nonsense and the street put its noise back on as if we had not been inside a moment when time slowed enough to let a man borrow a breath.

Not every call was kind. There was a boy with a mouth that couldn’t find enough air because he had run to the bus and his chest didn’t understand panic’s math, and he cried when I put my hand on his back the way boys do when they’re fourteen and furious at their bodies. There was a woman outside the co-op with blood on her chin because she had fainted elegantly and met the pavement with her mouth, and that one was a war in me and I lost the first round by looking, and Tamsin put her broad palm on my shoulder and turned me the way you redirect a horse and said, “Fetch the water and be nice to it,” and I did, and someone else did the napkins. There was a man with his wedding ring stuck because he’d got fatter from relief after his wife recovered and now his finger had opinions, and we cut the ring with a tool that made me respect metal while a stranger told me the entire plot of his favourite film because fear makes you generous with narrative.

On a night when the common smelled of fireworks left over from other people’s birthdays and the foghorn sang its basso in the channel, Kai came round with a bag of pears as if he had foraged them and not bought them because they were on special. He sprawled on my one good chair as if it were his shape and told me he was thinking of moving in with a woman whose name made him go red and whose mother had a cat that liked his shoes, and he asked me if I was going to be all right without him ten minutes away, and I told him I was a grown person with a kettle, and he said, “You’re not, but I’ll pretend you are,” and I said, “Buy a plant to impress the cat,” and he said, “That’s a different woman,” because he likes to be adored. He looked at my leaflet on the fridge and he said, “You’re an absolute weirdo,” and he hugged me in a way that got me in the ribs and left, and I stood there in the small kitchen and let the room be too quiet, which is another kind of training.

I saw the Dalloway man once in the market standing too near the fish. He was buying samphire like apologies and when he saw me he made the face you make when you’ve run out of synonyms for persistent. He told me the Council had conceded that the steps were theirs and would in future be stairs that love feet, and he told me Arthur had received enough compensation to buy a mobility scooter that went too fast, and he told me he had a client who needed a witness for a different kind of fall, and I said, “I am not your binoculars,” and he said, “You’ll change your mind when someone you love trips,” and I said, “That happened a decade ago and here we are,” and he put both hands up because he likes to end conversations looking like a man who can be trusted. He said Tamsin had declined to be eloquent for him, and I said, “She saves it for weddings and lawless boys,” and he laughed like someone who wished he’d been invited to be lawless.

On the Tuesday after the stairs remembered their job, Rena called me in a whisper to say, “Come quick, there’s a fox in the kitchen,” and when I got there it was a very ordinary cat with a torn ear and an opinion about bread, and we fed it tuna and called it Mr. Spence because that was the landlord’s boss at the surgery and he deserved to be reincarnated as a scavenger. Rena made tea that would singe your hair and told me with relish about a woman at bingo who had called another woman a cheater because her lucky dabber was too lucky, and how this had escalated to the point where security had been mentioned as a concept, and how Rena had diffused the situation by pretending to faint in a way that did not involve any blood, and how she’d got her friend a second book of numbers out of it because nothing soothes the savage heart like a discount. She told me to take my shoes off because they dragged the world over her floor. She told me to put my shoes back on because my socks were an insult. She told me she was proud of me for not doing a dramatic Victorian fall in someone else’s hallway, and I told her she made it easier to stand up. When she fell asleep in the chair with her mouth open on the second advertisement break, I turned the volume down and rolled a cushion under her head with the care you use for a bomb. Mr. Spence watched me with the bored loathing of cats and then made an audible decision that I might live.

We made a small habit of it, me and Tamsin and the Wednesday training and the occasional pager with its angry bee, and the Saturdays where I was the winter-coat presence at the edge of a wedding, holding a glass steady while someone tried to cry without ruining eyeliner, or carrying flowers that smelled like all the good days had been boiled down. On a Thursday she made me go with her to the registry office because a couple had argued all the way to the door and now couldn’t find the extra breath to make vows, and she stood behind the registrar like a stagehand with a god complex and nodded at the right moments, and when the woman said I will, I saw Tamsin make the smallest fist by her side like she had scored a goal. On a Monday we walked past the house where Marwick’s blinds were crooked and she told me he’d taken to shouting at the television because it doesn’t shout back with the particular obscenity he prefers, and she had told him to be kind in case he needed kindness later, and he had told her kindness is just the long way to weakness, and she had told him he was wrong and would learn, and we both looked at each other because we are still waiting to learn.

The night we finally made the bus stop out of air and stood under it like good citizens and told each other the history we’d owed, it rained the way this town likes to rain, sideways and petty. There is a bus stop at the end of Palmerston that is a rumour in winter and a kissing booth in June, and we took it from two girls wearing eyelashes like moth wings and one boy who pretended he had a date with the driver. The plastic was scratched with declarations that had outlasted the relationships. The schedule had been replaced so many times the pin had made a permanent hole. Tamsin tucked the cigarette behind her ear because she knows when to use her mouth for other work.

“It was not you,” she said, and the echo from all the other times she had said that didn’t make it less. “It was me and a man who wore aftershave like a threat and a ring that didn’t fit his finger. It was his stairs because he’d just got the flat and men like to show you their steps, like they made them. There was a party that was a room of men pretending beer is personality. There was a joke I made that he didn’t like because it made him visible to himself, and he didn’t know how to be visible without falling apart. He put his hand on my throat in the way of someone who has watched too much telly and learned the wrong lessons from it, and then he took it off because he is not a murderer and because there were witnesses and because the world is not a show. I went downstairs in a way that was almost a run, and I missed the third, and my knee took a holiday from my leg, and the nurse with the eyebrows held my face while the man with the nose ring did a thing with a splint and I thought, this is what happens when you flirt with men who want to be doors. Not stairs. Doors. That’s the story of the nearly dead with my name on it. The stairs you’re guilty about are the stairs you were irritating on. You were not hands. You were a boy. It’s not flattering. It’s better.”

“I want to put it down,” I said, and the relief of wanting is its own kind of weight. “I want to put it down and keep it on a shelf where I can be reminded without being punished.”

“You can,” she said, and then laughed at the look on my face because it was too easy a sentence to be true. “But you’ll pick it up again. That’s what we do. We tidy and then we rediscover mess and then we find better boxes. I will hold it sometimes for you. You can hold mine sometimes when I would like to pretend I was never stupid. We will be terrible at it and then a little better. And we will be civil when we have to be and kind when we can be and cruel only when someone is trying to put a hand on a throat. How’s that for a vow.”

“I’d marry that,” I said, and she made a face like a priest caught laughing.

“Don’t get grand,” she said. “You’re a man whose brain can be undone by tomatoes. Keep humble.”

A bus came and huffed and opened its door like a mouth and looked at us as if to say, are you getting on or are you always going to be this. We shook our heads in unison and the driver smirked because there is nothing drivers like better than being right about you. We walked home the long way past the arcade where the children of men who never learned to lose were teaching their sons how to shake a joystick until it cooperated, past the photo booth where a couple were trying to understand how their own faces could change so much from frame to frame, past the shop that sells high-visibility jackets and hope. My phone buzzed with the small emergency of a woman who had cut her thumb making soup for a neighbour, and I sent Adam three question marks and he sent back a postcode and a thumb and a heart. We went and put a plaster on a person who shouldn’t have been alone with knives, and I said I am here in a voice that didn’t tremble, and Tamsin mugged at me behind the woman’s back until I snorted and had to pretend to cough.

Later, at my sink, watching the water do its science, I caught my face again in the little mirror and tried the mouth that says we carry on. It fit better this time and that frightened me and soothed me both. The kettle made the house sound like it was thinking. The gulls had stopped for the day as if a supervisor had come round and told them there would be forms if they continued. The city ticked its radiators. Somewhere, in a different flat, a newly mended man tried not to shout at the news because stairs have a way of teaching you about what breaks. Somewhere else a nurse took off her shoes and put on her ordinary feet and let the evening have her. Somewhere else again a bus driver went home and did not talk because holding other people’s schedules in your head all day is its own silence. I washed a cup and did not cut my hand and felt like a magician who refuses to show his sleeves.

At the end of the week Adam said there was a football match and the ambulance service had too few hands for too many lads who think singing is first aid. He asked if I could stand by the gate with a bag full of water and stern words, and Tamsin said she would come because she likes to watch men try to be serious in shorts. Fratton Park had its winter lights up because football has its own seasons that ignore weather. The air tasted of onions and jealousy. A boy not yet old enough to regret anything threw up on his own shoes and a man old enough to be his grandfather told him to aim better next time. We stood with our arms crossed like bouncers in a comedy sketch and gave out plasters to the kind of cuts the day has on it when it’s nearly funny. In the second half there was a scuffle with more choreography than harm, the kind where everyone wants to be stopped and nobody wants to admit that, and Tamsin inserted herself with the skill of a pint in a crowded bar and said, “No,” in a tone that belongs to mothers and magistrates. The knot un-tied. A man with a white scar at the corner of his eye stared at me like he’d met me before and couldn’t place where, and then he nodded in a way that said, not today, and the game resumed pretending to matter.

On the way out a woman tapped my arm with the special permission reserved for people who’ve watched you be useful and therefore own a small part of your time. She said, “You’re the fish boy, aren’t you,” and I said, “Not anymore,” and she said, “Good,” and we both laughed because there are jobs that take pieces of you and leave you with scales. She told me her daughter wanted to be a paramedic because she’d watched a video on the internet of a man being revived in an airport and decided that was the only magic worth learning. I told her to tell the girl to practice saying I am here without sounding grand. She said she would and then she told me she had never known what to do with her hands and now she did and I said, “Put them in your pockets,” and she said, “In this town they call that attitude,” and I said, “Then buy better pockets,” and she clapped me on the arm like I had told a joke that made sense to both of us.

The next morning the Dalloway man sent a photograph to my phone of the new steps with the ribbon cut, some councillor who looks the same in every town holding the scissors and pretending to have done anything except sign, and under it a caption that said, you did this, and I wrote back, the man’s shin did this, and he sent three laughing faces because he is capable of humility in pixels. I showed Rena and she said, “About time,” and then cried in the kitchen where you are allowed, and I put my hand on her shoulder and left it there even when she made the face that means, get off me, I am not sentimental, because I have learned to translate.

At the edge of sleep, nights, the stairs still come. They arrive like a child with a story they need you to hear at two in the morning. The scarf is still red. The sound is still itself. But it is in a room with other sounds now, the ship, the kettle, the bus. It is a citizen. That is what I am trying to be. Not healed. Not clean. Present. Available for the noise and what it makes of a day. When the pager goes, I put on my coat. When Tamsin calls, I answer. When Kai texts a picture of a plant that is dying and asks me how to make it live, I tell him to stop talking to it like an enemy. When Rena says, “Heaven is a council house with stairs that don’t kill you,” I say, “Amen,” and mean it. I say I am here into the mirror, and sometimes I believe it long enough to say it again to someone who is not me.The wind did that January thing where it makes everything feel underdressed. It came off the water with pins in it and threaded itself through the gaps around my window like it had paid rent. The kettle sulked and clicked and got on with the job. I stood with my hands around the mug and told them to believe in heat. The city had been threatening a storm all week, the streetlights jittering like nervous horses, the ferries testing their horns as if to remind us they could be opera when they wanted to. Rena called at eight to say the bingo had been cancelled in advance because the hall roof had ideas, and she sounded put out in the way she only gets when fate thinks it’s funny. “If it’s going to rain, it should rain,” she said. “No half measures. I’ve set out pots on principle.” I promised to come over later with bread because bread is how we pretend to be ready for anything, and she told me to bring the good jam because she was not in the mood to be poor in that way.

By ten the sky had made its choice and come down. The street outside my block turned from road to river in the time it takes to swear and mean it. The gulls tried to hang in the air like mugs on a rack and mostly succeeded because arrogance is one of their better tricks. The pager went before the rain hit its rhythm. It rattled in my pocket and made my ribs remember every time a phone has had bad news. COPD again, said the little screen, like an old friend you don’t have the courage to tell to stop calling, and a building in Eastney I knew by its habit of peeling paint. I texted Tamsin out of muscle memory and she sent back a single umbrella and then, as if she had thought better of leaving her meaning in pictures, I’m five away, and I put my coat on in the way you put on armour you don’t entirely trust.

The stairwell smelled like damp bread and old laughter. I hit the street and the rain hit back, thick enough to make you feel like you were swimming upright. The road to Eastney was an argument between taxis and vans and one man on a bike who had convinced himself he was immortal for the morning. The power lines hummed like a low choir. I cut across by the lido, its water slopping at the edges, green as if it had kept a summer it wasn’t allowed. Tamsin appeared out of the downpour like a conspiracy, hair slicked to her skull, mouth set in the line that means she’s already decided this will be fine.

Inside the flat was the collected smell of a life that had fought damp and not always won. The old man in the chair had lungs playing a drum solo badly. His wife had two blankets, neither of which was doing what blankets pretend, and a face that had set like plaster around a shape it didn’t want to admit to. We did the thing we knew: introductions, your name is a bridge, count with me, the long out breath like you’re bullying a candle, you are not alone. The oxygen machine in the corner had a red light on that wanted to be an alarm if someone gave it permission. “Power’s been flicking,” said the wife. “It thinks it’s a club.” The mask hissed and offered cold air like a mean charity. Tamsin perched on the arm of the chair because chairs tell her their intentions, and I took the old man’s hand because hands lie less than mouths and I wanted to know if he was willing to stay.

We were halfway through the numbers when something upstairs happened that the building didn’t like. It was a thud with a note in it that made my bones tune themselves, and then the thin shout of someone saying a name that wasn’t being answered. Tamsin looked at me as if to ask whether the noise was in my head and then we both moved because if it wasn’t, we were late. The old woman clutched my sleeve as if she was claiming me for her team, and I said, “Two minutes,” in the tone you’re taught for emergency promises. Tamsin took the stairs two at a time and I went less prettily and we came round the turn to find a door open and a green runner rug crumpled like a letter.

He was sprawled halfway across the landing, a fishing jacket on that made him look like he’d tried to prepare for weather in the privacy of his home. His hair had the white of a man who has recently stopped pretending to dye it. The radiator had come loose in the fall and the sound of it trying to be attached to a pipe and failing was a kind of whimper. There was blood. Of course there was blood. It had a way of finding me even when I took the scenic route. It came from his scalp, which is to say there was more of it than my brain believed a head should have, ridiculous amounts that chased themselves down the side of his face and into the rug, making patterns that would have interested me in another life. He made a noise that reminded me of the beginning of a laugh, which is a terrible thing for a body to do when it’s trying to convince you it’s unhurt.

My throat did the small close over it does when red is in the room, a sympathetic door. The trick is to get ahead of that door before it slams. I said, “Hello,” loud enough to bully the colour back into being just a colour, and then I did the thing they showed us with head wounds, that dance between knowing it looks worse than it is and not letting it be worse than it is. Tamsin had the kit open and the gauze in my hand before I had properly asked. “Pressure,” she said, and the word is so bossy it helps. I folded and pressed and looked at the skirting board and his eyes and the nail in the plaster where a picture used to be, anywhere except the theatre of it. The man said something about wet and cold that might have been a joke or a complaint. I said my name again because sometimes it’s the only tool I have that bites.

He did not like me. This was obvious in the way he tried to pull away as if my face offended him. He had the kind of posh the navy gives a certain kind of boy and he wore it even lying on his own carpet. “You’re the fish lad,” he said, which would have made me laugh if my mouth weren’t busy being useful. “The one who fainted over a sardine.”

“I didn’t faint,” I said on instinct, which made Tamsin smirk because she likes me better when I argue myself into being visible. “We’re going to be friends you and I. I’m going to give your head back to you if you let me.” The gauze warmed under my hand. The red tried to behave. The radiator clunked like a drunk trying not to admit it. Tamsin had called Adam without telling me she had moved and then moved again; I watched her mouth make words that would fetch a vehicle as if she were ordering bread.

“You’re touching me,” he said, like it was a surprise and a complaint in one.

“That’s right,” I said. “I am here.” The sentence just came out of me. He made a face like he’d heard that before from someone he hadn’t wanted to trust. I kept talking because the part of me that is twelve had learned how to take over the speaking when blood tried to run the show. I told him the thing about starlings at the Common and how they managed to fly without leaking into each other, and he looked at me sideways and said, “You’re a strange boy,” and I said, “Man, technically,” and he said, “Debatable,” and then the room let me breathe.

Adam arrived with a woman I didn’t know and the air changed as it always does when someone whose job it is to stop endings enters. They put their hands where mine had been and told the bleeding to be less dramatic. There was an exchange about blood thinners and the word warfarin that always sounds like a ship. The woman asked him how much he’d had to drink and he told her the truth with the sheepishness of a man who has lived in a place where everyone knows if you lie. Adam looked at me and nodded in that way that says, see, you didn’t run, and my head did the thing where it measures its own edges and finds them intact.

After, back downstairs with the old man and his oxygen that had decided to behave now the building had calmed and the electricity remembered duty, I found myself shaking just in the fingers, the rest of me bored with the idea of panic. The old woman patted my wrist like a pigeon pecks bread, distractedly affectionate. “He’s a bastard,’ she said, meaning upstairs, which told me more than the fall had, “but he’s our bastard and he plays whist on Thursdays and he knows where the good chips are.” Tamsin said something kind that sounded like a threat, and we left with the rain making our hair into a statement.

At noon the whole of Southsea became candles and teaspoons because the power decided it had had enough of work. Shops put handwritten signs in windows and discovered their pens were failing too. The bakery sold out of buns in twenty minutes and then stood there like a stage set, full of flour and apologies. The Spinnaker looked like it would like to take the afternoon off. I went to Rena’s with the bread because the one thing we can control is sandwiches, and found her sitting in the dark with a torch under her chin like a child telling a ghost story. She was delighted with herself because she had boiled an egg on a camping stove and not set fire to the curtains. “I told the boy upstairs not to light his barbecue in the hall,” she said. “He asked me if I was the fire brigade. I said today, love, everyone is the fire brigade.”

We played cards by the window and cheated with total sincerity, and she told me stories of storms with names that used to matter and how they had measured them by which tiles went and whose cat by. The fear in me had been given a job that morning and it had worked hard and was sleepy. I felt almost like a person who could be relied upon. When the lights came back on at four the whole building gave a sigh like an old woman sitting down in a good chair. Rena hissed at the bulb for being presumptuous. “I liked us better in the dark,” she said. “You looked less worried.” I told her she looked like a queen in a power cut and she told me to stop being a fool and pass the butter.

Dalloway sent a text at six that made me grimace even before I read it because his name in a line looks like a judgment. Can you and Miss Keen come in tomorrow? it said. Marwick’s solicitor is asking for statements about a separate incident. The words separate incident rattled in my head like a coin in a jar. I showed Tamsin without comment and she made the face that means she is deciding whether to set something on fire or file it neatly. “He’s like lichen,” she said. “You don’t notice him until he’s everywhere.”

In bed the rain did its hard work on the glass and I listened to it argue with the gutters as if they owed it money. The city hummed with the relief of lights being lights, the fridge coming back to its small vocalising, the neighbours putting on the television with a kind of vengeance. I let the day replay in my skull like a tape I couldn’t misplace if I tried. There was red in it. There was the thunk of a skull against a skirting board. There were my hands doing a job my brain had held back from for years. There was a sentence that had crawled out of me without being invited and yet had the right name on it. I am here, I had said, to a man who didn’t want me touching him, and he had not died out of spite. I fell asleep with that in my mouth like an aspirin.

Morning came out of the east the way it likes to, with the look of someone who is trying to be friendly and is not sure how. Dalloway’s office had the thermostat set to a temperature meant to disorient your softer parts. His assistant had a haircut that gave her people skills she pretended not to own. He poured us water as if we had come to confess a murder. “It isn’t what you’re thinking,” he said, which is precisely what you say when it is. “Marwick’s ex-tenant is making noise. She claims he shoved her in the doorway last autumn when she came to ask about her deposit. He says he didn’t. The stairs got blamed. They always do. I need people who have lived in his buildings to say what kind of man he is around his doors.”

Tamsin’s jaw made a shape I had been introduced to in kitchens and corridors since the day I met her. “What kind is that,” she said, very mild.

“The kind,” said Dalloway, fussing with a paperclip like it was a pet, “who might push without thinking because the world is in his way. Or the kind who has never in his life lifted a hand to anyone who didn’t deserve a handshake. Either will do, depending on where you’re standing.” He looked at us with that particular male hope that women might offer him a dramatic truth because it would help his paperwork be a poem.

“We can say he is the kind who thinks other people’s time is soup he can drink,” said Tamsin. “We can say he is the kind whose voice gets louder when you say no. We can say he is the kind who borrows ladders and loses receipts. We can say stairs don’t like him. But you don’t get to make me do your job without paying me in something better than gratitude.”

“You want money?” he said, surprised, which told me he hadn’t been paying attention to the principle of the city.

“I want my people not to have to prove they’re not liars,” she said. “Write your letter so it says what it should whether I sign it or not. And write him a letter that says be small in future. You know how to do that. Pretend he’s a council.” She stood up without giving the chair time to argue and I followed, because she goes through doors like a weather system and you take your chances.

Outside on the pavement that always smells faintly of fish because of the shop three doors down, she put her hands in the pockets of her jacket like a man in a photograph of a band. “We don’t owe him our blood,” she said, as if the morning were a person who required telling off. “We’ve done the stairs. We do not have to become the kind of people who turn every memory into a court.”

“You would be very good in a court,” I said, and she pulled a face as if I had insulted her by complimenting.

“Don’t,” she said. “You’ll make me buy a suit and then I’ll become the version of myself that sends emails at midnight. I like being the version of myself that knows the exact number of chairs in a room without counting.” She glanced at my hands in that habit of hers that pretends she is not checking if I am shaking. I wasn’t. I might later, but I wasn’t. She looked pleased in that way she never admits.

The town ran like it does when weather has had its say and lost. We worked a wedding that pretended to be under control and was not, because the band were two hours late after being sent to the wrong Waverley by a text with a typo and the groom’s mother had a nosebleed that looked like a disaster but was just a conversation stopper. I held a napkin like a banner and looked at the ceiling while Tamsin tilted heads and told fear to stop shouting. The bride decided at the last minute that she hated lilies because they smelled like sadness, and Tamsin put her arm through mine and said, “We will fetch more roses,” and we did, consulting with a florist who acted like he had never seen panic before and wanted to keep it as a pet.

On the way back, carrying too many stems for a man with my centre of gravity, we cut through the little park near the library with the willow that thinks it lives by a lake. A man was sitting on the bench with a dog at his feet that looked like it had been compiled from spare parts and a bottle of whiskey in one hand like a fairy tale, and he was crying with his mouth shut. I don’t see myself in a lot of men but I saw something of my worst self in him, that determination to be stoic and therefore in trouble. Tamsin slowed, almost imperceptibly, and the dog lifted its head with that particular dignity dogs have when they haven’t been treated right. I stopped because I have learned that sometimes stopping is the actual job.

You doing all right, mate, said Tamsin in a tone you can lift people with. He nodded in a way that meant no and yes and don’t you dare. The bottle had writing on it that wanted you to think it was a friend. There was blood on his knuckle where he had punched the wrong thing. I felt the old horse in my chest start to drag its hooves and I told it no. I said my line. I am here. It is a ridiculous sentence out of context. It is sometimes the only one that turns a room back into a room. He looked at me with the special contempt a certain sort of man reserves for tenderness and then he gave up and started talking and he did not stop for long enough for Tamsin to ask the questions she had in her pocket. His wife had gone two weeks ago to her sister’s in Fareham and he had used the quiet as an excuse to become smaller than he had been promised. The dog had been unfed in the way dogs are unfed when men are ashamed. He had cut his hand on a can of beans because justice likes to be sly. We fed the dog a biscuit I had forgotten was in my coat. We cleaned his knuckle without making a speech about infection. We called his sister because he asked us to and he cried some more because it is easier on the phone. We did nothing that would look interesting written up by a policeman. It felt like digging a car out of sand with a teaspoon. It felt like the only thing that makes a week difference.

That night, lying on my ridiculous high bed like a man who doesn’t trust floors, I said the sentence out loud to the ceiling, quietly, in case the ceiling was trying to sleep. I am here. It has become a superstition, like touching wood, like counting to five while the kettle boils. It has become a spell. The stairs in my head were quieter because the storm had found them and put seaweed on them. The guilt had a shape I could walk round rather than a fog I kept swallowing. I thought of the old man’s scalp and the foolish theatre of head wounds and of my hand being useful where once it would have undone me. I thought of the dog eating a dry biscuit like grace. I thought of Dalloway and his neat hands and the way he needs us to turn our history into his casework, and I hoped for his sake he has a woman like Rena to tell him to be small when he needs telling.

It is not neat, any of it. We do not become new people because we decide to. My fear still watches me when I change a lightbulb as if it knows how much can go wrong with glass. I still cross the street sometimes to avoid a man with a ring on his hand because old warning systems don’t care for updates. Sometimes I find myself looking at a knife in a kitchen and telling it what it is, out loud, so it doesn’t misunderstand me. Sometimes in the supermarket I swear I can smell blood even in the aisle where they keep tinned tomatoes, which is unfair and ridiculous and how my brain says hello. But on Wednesdays I go and kneel by plastic and make the chest rise and pretend the absence of a face is a kindness. On Saturdays I watch brides insist on impossible flowers and I watch Tamsin make them bloom anyway out of paper and politics. On Sundays I sit in Rena’s kitchen and eat jam that tastes more of sugar than fruit and hope she will tell me the peach story again.

In late January the foghorn started up in the corner of the evening where men on the buses start to nod against the window and teenagers begin to multiply in corners. It blew the long note that knits you into your bed. I wrote my name on a piece of paper I had been ignoring, the one from the ambulance service that said, if you want, if you can, there’s a course where you might be allowed to ride along and learn how to be the person in the back who doesn’t flinch. I folded it and put it in an envelope and took it to the letterbox at the end of my road where the paint is always a step behind the rust. I put it in the slot before I could decide it was a romantic gesture rather than a plan. The world did not change shape. The streetlight did not applaud. A cat went under a car with the air of someone making a formal exit from a dull party. I turned my collar up and went to the sea to see if it looked different now that I had decided a very small thing. It looked the same. It looked enormous and bored and gorgeous and indifferent. It looked like it had all the time in the world. I stood there and told it, quietly so as not to make a fool of myself, that I was here, and it did what seas do, which is ignore me completely and make me better anyway.The letter did not announce itself with trumpets. It came through the slot and sulked on the mat as if it had been told off on the way. The envelope was the obstinate brown of bureaucracy, and the logo in the corner was the same polite blue that asks you to rate your pain. I stood with toast and considered the risk of hope, which in this house sticks to the teeth. I opened it with the butter knife because the proper knife and I are on speaking terms only in good light. The words were simple, almost embarrassed: we are pleased to confirm your observer shift, Saturday night, 19:00–03:00, report to St. Mary’s, wear sensible shoes. There was a line about confidentiality that made my chest do its own signature. There was a line about not getting in the way that felt like an old friend. There was a name at the bottom that wasn’t Adam but could be someone who knows Adam’s ringtone.

I took it to Rena because she is my official reader of notices and doom. She put her glasses down her nose like a teacher who can make fractions feel personal. “Observer,” she read with relish, as if the word observed her back. “So you get to watch and breathe and not break anything? That’s your calling, dear heart. You can be the wallpaper of medicine.” She kissed the top of my head to bless the endeavour and told me to eat before the city ate me, which is the closest she gets to a speech. I texted Tamsin a photograph of the letter and she replied with three sirens, then a string of knives and fish until the phone looked like a kitchen drawer, then, finally, words: I am going to buy you sensible shoes you will hate.

In the afternoons the Dockyard is better behaved than it’s famous for. The Warrior sits with her iron sides pretending this was always what ships looked like, and the Victory sulks under scaffolding like a celebrity getting dental work. Tamsin had conned a couple with a love of history into thinking vows taste better under a figurehead. The events office had given her a badge that would have made a lesser person unbearable, and she used it to make men with epaulettes move chairs. There is something about being beneath a ship that makes everyone stand up straighter, as if the air is full of rank. I tied ribbon round cutlery until my fingers learned the braille of it, and she negotiated a truce between the caterers and a woman whose cake wanted to be eight tiers of apology. We took a minute on the quay when the light folded itself into the water like a handkerchief and watched a ferry write its slow sentence out of harbour. “Remember when we used to race the Gosport,” she said, and I said, “You remember anything that lets you win,” and she said, “Learn from the best.”

On Tuesday Dalloway sent a message that had the energy of a man with a ruler. He wanted statements about the ex-tenant, the separate incident that was not separate from anything, and he wanted them yesterday, which is his favourite time. Tamsin looked at the text and sighed like a kettle with no switch. “He thinks our lives are a filing cabinet,” she said. “He can have my words when I decide where they go.” She asked me if I wanted to meet the woman before we put our names under Dalloway’s, and I said yes because I have learned that most crisis is improved by a face. We met her at the cafe that used to be a bank and still pretends it has vaults under the muffins. Her name was Saffron because sometimes Portsmouth has a sense of humour, and she had a baby on her hip whose stare could have stripped paint. She told us about the doorway like it was a bad joke: the knock, the hand that found a shoulder instead of a wall, the apology that arrived later than the bruise. “He said he tripped on the mat,” she said. “He said I startled him. The way men say you made them do it and think they’ve got away with a magic trick.” Tamsin was kind in the way that says, I will carry some of this and you don’t get to argue. We told her we would put our names where they might do a little good and not be used for anything else. We told her about Dalloway’s tie without saying his name. The baby grabbed my thumb and the scar on my hand lit up like a map. “That’s a sign,” Saffron said, and I said, “Of what,” and she said, “Of someone else being present,” and for once the word did not make me wish to run.

Saturday came dressed as rain. St. Mary’s does the kind of quiet that tastes of bleach and history. The ambulance bay had its line of green machines angled like greyhounds at a starting gate, and inside the station was the smell of tea so strong I could hear it. A wall of lockers wore names like medals. Adam appeared out of a room with a washing machine and a man’s sleep got caught in his hair. He handed me a hi-vis vest that made me look like a cautionary tale and told me the rules as if he were reading me a bedtime story: don’t touch needles, don’t argue with drunk people unless you’re bored, don’t faint in the back because it frightens the driver, don’t post about anything except how good the biscuits are. His partner that night was Nic, who had a ponytail that could cut you and a wit like a scalpel. She shook my hand like we had decided to be on the same team. “Stand where we tell you,” she said, “and if you start going, sit neatly.”

The first hour was a list of almosts. A woman who had misread a sell-by date and convinced herself she was poisoned, a man who had noticed his heart beating and resented it, a call that was cancelled when the caller remembered this is what gin does in January. We ate crisps behind a petrol station like criminals and Nic told me the whole of a gossip that involved a wrong baby, a right dog and a funeral that had to be delayed because the vicar knew the deceased too well. The radio spoke in acronyms as if being coy might make emergencies elegant. My head adjusted its brim and tried not to anticipate red.

Around eleven a cyclist introduced himself to a car door. It happens as often as people breathe badly. He was a boy with a beard as if he’d borrowed it, lying in the rain with his bike considering emigration. There was blood at his eyebrow that made too big a show of it, and his knee had the kind of swelling that looks like a personality. I looked for the floor to tilt and it did not oblige me. I held the umbrella over his face and said my line, and he made the old joke about angels that even atheists know. Nic glued his eyebrow as if she were making art out of something that had gone wrong, and Adam made his knee a number and decided it could survive without hospitals if it were bribed with rest. A woman came out of a house and declared herself a nurse and told us how we were doing it wrong in the specific way of retired professionals, and Adam thanked her as if she had handed us a feather. The boy cried a little in the polite way and told me he was supposed to propose next week on Portsdown Hill at sunset, and I said, “Try sunrise, you’ll have it to yourself,” and he looked at me as if I had invented a new joy. When we left, Adam said, “That face you do where you look like you can see the ending? Keep that. People will tell you the next part if you hold your mouth like that,” and I put the compliment in my pocket and took it out again to check it was real.

After midnight the calls changed shape. There is a point where Saturday turns into something else and the city’s pulses coincide. We went to a kebab queue where a man was bleeding from the knuckles because the air had offended him, and he refused plasters as if they had a political leaning. We went to a girl on a pavement who had put into her body more than narratives and had decided to stop being awake about it, and Nic crouched and told her in a factual voice that breathing was back in fashion. We went to a house in Milton where a woman was in labour and thought she shouldn’t be, not yet, not here, and Adam did the maths with his eyebrows and phoned the unit and said words like “multip” and “parity” that made me feel I had walked into Latin class. The bedroom smelled of shampoo and heat and surrender. The baby arrived in a sound that could have been laughter or despair. There was blood, because there is always blood when life thinks it is being generous, and my tongue tasted tin and my neck remembered it could be a narrowing door, and I stepped into the hallway and counted the pores in the paint and returned with towels and an apology. The baby cried, which is to say the room remembered what lungs are for. The father tried to faint and I told him there was a queue and he laughed and didn’t. On the way out Adam clapped my shoulder and said, “That one gets a blue hat,” and in the back I decided to love the word hat.

At two there was a call that arrived with a weight in it. The radio did a tone nobody jokes about and said the word chest too flat to be the muscle. We were at the leisure centre car park in a minute and a half that lasted an hour. A man was on the tarmac under the sodium lights like a fallen torch. He was the kind of fifty it takes some men a war to get to. Someone had tried compressions and done their best without being told how. He was grey in the curious way that doesn’t look like skin. This is where the films are wrong. There was no violins, only the sound of plastic tearing and a voice that had decided it would not cry. Adam said, “On,” in a voice that peeled stickers and Nic stuck pads where pads like to live and the machine had its say. I knelt and put my hands where the woman with the hair at the community centre had told me, and the breastbone did the bend it does when you ask it for more, and I counted because numbers are the only gods that go quiet when you talk to them. The machine was kind enough to advise electricity and the man’s body answered in the involuntary way that makes you feel you have asked too much. There was a smear of blood at his mouth, a small red parenthesis, and the part of my head that wants to be dramatic stepped towards the stage and I told it to sit down and stop showing off. I was the metronome. Nic breathed the air in and out with a mask that made everyone look more human. Adam watched the screen like there was a secret map on it. The siren of the second crew arrived and added another note to the anthem. It was long, and then it was suddenly not, because the time compressed when the monitor decided to stop being a flat liar and become a little mountain range. “Got one,” said Adam, cautious as if praise might frighten it. The man’s chest decided to do the work without us. When they loaded him, his hand came up and grabbed Nic’s sleeve in a full, strange gesture, as if he were pulling himself back into the world with her cloth. I sat back on my heels and realised the wet had gone through my trousers and into my bones, and I realised I was hungry, which is how you know the body has decided to stay.

At three an old man refused to let us in because he had never let anyone in after midnight in seventy years and wasn’t starting now, so Adam shouted directions through a letterbox while the old man managed his own inhalers and I held the torch like a technician in a very niche theatre. By half past we were back where the kettles live and Nic had found a biscuit she had been saving for a day with this colour, and Adam put the kettle on and then turned it off because the radio told us we didn’t earn tea yet. When four arrived, it did so with the thin light the city keeps in a drawer. We were released into it with the odd ceremony of people who have put off sleep for too long. Adam hugged me without making it a thing, his jacket cold and soft with the smell of other lives. “You didn’t faint,” he said, as if that was a joke and not a sacrament. “You didn’t run. You wore that vest with dignity. Come again when you fall out with Saturdays.”

On Sunday the city had been rinsed and left on the line. The streets were tired of their own reflections. I took two hours to stare at the wall and let myself have the shakes I hadn’t had time for, and when my hands had finished making music on their own, I took bread to Rena and told her about hat babies without telling her about how close some men can get to not being men anymore. She made me eat eggs as if it were a legal requirement, and then she took my face in her dry hands and said, “You look steadier. You look like you leaned on something that didn’t mind,” and I cried for five seconds because you have to let the pressure out somewhere. Tamsin came in halfway through and pretended not to see. She sat on the edge of the table like furniture is a suggestion and I told her in an untidy way about the chest and the machine, and she went quiet in the serious way that is her truest self, and then she said, “Next time I want to stand where you put your hands,” as if wanting could get her a seat on the back step of the future.

Monday the letter from Dalloway, stamped and severe, asked us to attend a meeting where a solicitor with a tie and a parting would try to make memory behave in bullet points. We went because we are people who complain and do the thing anyway. The room was too warm in the old way of rooms that hold their heat like grudges. The woman representing Marwick had the kind of hair that says you can’t afford me, and the woman representing the ex-tenant had shoes that said she would run in them if necessary. We said the things we could stand by; that men who lean are more dangerous than men who shove because leaning is deniable; that doorways are where power collects; that the world is full of hands that think they are accidental. The solicitor tried to find the bit where we would contradict ourselves, and Tamsin smiled the way a person smiles when she knows where your rope runs out. “My name is not your evidence,” she said, and the woman with the shoes smiled into her water. After, in the cold, I told Dalloway he would look better in a different blue and he laughed like a dog who has learned how to.

Work returned in its coastal way: a freezer van broke at the Waverley and we had to talk a chef out of crying into langoustines; a florist phoned to say his van had been stolen and did we want the flowers anyway, he could throw them from the window; a mother of the bride had decided to wear the same colour as the bridesmaids because she liked how it made her look taller. The week had edges and they didn’t bleed. On Wednesday the community centre smelled of floor cleaner and resilience and I pressed the chest of a plastic man until the world narrowed and then widened, and Adam told me my counting had improved and I said, “It’s always the sevens that get me,” and he said, “Me too,” and we looked at each other like we had known that all along.

By the second Saturday of February the starlings were free with their rehearsals and people who didn’t usually look up remembered they had necks for it. The cold was kinder, the light less stingy. Tamsin got a call she took in the tiny garden she insists her flat has, and when she came back in she had a face like she had bitten into something sharp and wanted more. “They want to interview me,” she said, failing to pretend disinterest. “The ambulance people. For the zero-to-hero thing. They say I could be a care assistant in six months if I promise not to shout at old men for being old. I told them I can promise to shout behind my teeth.” She looked at me like someone had handed her a map to a place she’d drawn in her head. I tried to be the right size of proud and managed something close. “Do the uniform and the nights and the tea you forget to drink,” I said. “Do the whole romance. You look good in green.”

“Don’t flirt with me about trousers,” she said, and hugged me in the lopsided way that means she uses her left shoulder to hold herself up and borrows my right.

Marwick fell silent for a blessed week and it was only later we learned that silence was the sound of a case being prepared. Arthur, from his window, shouted down gossip in bite sizes; that a judge with eyebrows that knew contempt had told Marwick to sit in a chair and listen; that the ex-tenant had an advocate with hands like she was good at tying knots; that the steps now had grit glued into their noses in case men thought they were allowed to slide. Rena said it was a miracle and I said it was paperwork, and she said those are the same thing if you live long enough.

The observer shifts became a habit of sorts. I learned the voice the radio uses when it’s lying about distance. I learned which puddles on Eastern Road are deeper than they pretend. I learned what time the city’s drunkest men become sweet and how to stand so a frightened child sees you before she sees her mother seeing her. There were nights without red and nights when a glass in a kitchen cut a hand and the kitchen turned into a theatre and I looked at the floorboards and described the grain. There was a call to a boy who had decided knives are for solving maths and lost the argument with his own skin. The blood was articulate in the way teenage mistakes are. I breathed and did not run, which feels like a poor boast until you can’t boast it. I learned the smell of adrenaline in other people and in myself, how it tastes like pennies and old keys. I learned that some men cry when told they are not dying, and some laugh when told they might have to, and both deserve tea.

The third time the pager bossed me during a wedding, Tamsin told the registrar we were on an emergency and the registrar rolled his eyes and said, “Always,” and I ran down the steps of the registry office like the world had given me a deadline. A woman had fainted in the lobby and knocked her head against the radiator in a performance my nightmares have tried to own for years. The radiator did its comic clank, the kind that says it never wanted to be involved. The cut was small and mouthy. I sat with my back against the wall and told her about the weather as if weather could sutures. I put a pad where pads go and pressed and watched the vein in her neck be steady under her skin. Tamsin fetched a plaster that had a cartoon animal on it because that is what they keep for children and adults who need lies. The woman’s eye made a shape that meant she was back enough to be embarrassed. “I’ve always been dramatic,” she said, and I said, “No, me,” and we had a small contest about who had caused more trouble for strangers. When Adam arrived he brought the smell of motion with him and nodded as if he was proud in the quiet way men have built for not being caught at it. Later Tamsin told me she had found me looking directly at the colour and not folding, and I put that in the drawer in my head where I had kept all the times I had failed, and for company I left it there with this better picture.

When Tamsin went to her interview she wore black and laughed at herself for it. She came out with a smile that was all gums and bones. “They asked me how I handle stress and I told them weddings,” she said. “They asked me if I had any weaknesses and I said a tendency to speak in complete sentences, and the woman with the highlighter laughed like a drain. They said my references use words like force of nature, which I’m choosing to take as flattery. They said there will be a fitness test that is mostly carrying things up stairs, and I told them stairs and I have an understanding.” We went to the Common to tell the water about it and the water was busy but allowed us a look. A boy was trying to fly a kite that did not want to work and his father was pretending he had known all along this was a terrible plan, and Tamsin shouted helpful lies about angles and the wind took pity on the child and made a play for the sky.

There are things I still can’t do. There are days I cannot make myself go into the aisle with the raw meat. There are mornings when the memory of the bus stop tastes like metal and I throw the duvet over my head and declare a private state of emergency. There are afternoons when a red thread on a stranger’s sleeve is enough to thin the air, and I go and stand in the garden of the pub and count the holes in the fence until my lungs remember how. But there are also nights where a man’s heart stops pretending and I put the heel of my hand on his other truth and do not fall. There are Wednesdays where we stand in a circle and do the counting together and each seven is a kind of prayer I have learned to say without believing in anything more than breath. There are Saturdays where a bride’s grandfather falls asleep in the disabled loo and I talk him awake without making him into a joke, and he tells me about Sicily in 1944 and we both pretend the present is a small room we can exit any time.

In March, when the daffodils did their loose coins routine on roundabouts and the town forgave itself for a winter of mould, a letter came for me that did not sulk. This one had a confidence to it, the NHS crest in a mood you could have a drink with. It said there was a place on a course, a real one, the kind with whole breaths and shifts attached, an introduction to being the voice that travels with the kit. It told me the days and the hours and the rooms it would need me in. It told me there would be a uniform at the end if I didn’t embarrass anyone. It told me to bring my own pen. I showed it to the kettle in case I’d misread it, and the kettle clicked like a tongue and turned itself on, and I took that as endorsement. I took it to Rena who pretended to be unimpressed so she could be more impressed, and I took it to Tamsin who held the paper like it was a small animal and tried not to squeeze. “Look at us,” she said, “being useful on purpose.”

We went to the sea because the sea has been forced to listen to everything else. The wind had become almost polite and the gulls were out on a union break. The Spinnaker looked like a skewer for sky. We sat on the wall with chips we pretended were not supper and talked about trousers and shifts and the smell of ambulance interior in summer, and she told me she had been offered a start date that didn’t make sense with weddings, and she would have to choose the sort of chaos she wanted, and I told her to choose the one that lets her sleep three hours and wake up proud rather than eight and wake up bored, and she told me I had no business sounding wise with salt on my chin. A boy ran on the stones until one of them betrayed his ankle and fell and did the thing children do where they look for permission to cry, and we both waved at his mother like satellites. We talked about Rena’s knees, which had decided to be less angry because attention had been paid, and we talked about Kai’s plant, which was thriving after he had stopped informing it of the news.

If there is a point to any of this, it is not one you can write on a banner and take to a march. It is in the small repetition of showing up. It is in the way the kettle permits the day with steam, and the way the gulls insist the bins are theirs, and the way the stairs remember their job if you don’t let them forget. It is in the difference between a town that pretends not to need you and a town that admits it misses you when you’re not on the wall where you sit to watch the water turn iron into light. It is in the phrase I am here, which is nothing and everything, which is not a saint’s vow or a politician’s promise, which is the sort of thing you can say to a bleeding child or a complaining drunk or a woman who has done her own heroics and wants you to notice. It is in the moments where you get to say it to yourself in a mirror above a sink that was never intended for drama and believe it a fraction longer than last time. It is in the fact that when the pager rattles its insect rattle and my body disobeys me and goes towards something red, Tamsin texts a fish and a knife and then an umbrella, and Rena sets out cups without asking, and Adam raises an eyebrow that means both courage and tea. It is, I think, in the fact that the sea ignores us and makes us better anyway, and we keep telling it our plans because we are ridiculous like that and we have to be.By the time the acceptance email turned into a timetable and a badge you could clip on without laughing, the town had remembered how to be late winter. The wind went through us instead of around us and the sun had learned to be patient in a way that looked like faith. The course lived in a building that used to be a school and now pretended to be a hospital on weekends; there were posters of lungs smiling and diagrams of hearts that looked like shame. We sat at tables that had carved names from the eighties and the tutor was a woman with hair like a helmet who said, “You will not be heroes here. You will be competent. Heroes get in the way. Competence makes it home for tea.” She made us stick pads on mannequins until the mannequins looked like they were auditioning for a low-budget science fiction, and she timed our stairs like she was charging rent at each landing.

I had told myself the stairs would be the test and then the stairs took that personally. Four flights in a building that had learned mildew like a second language, carrying a folded chair that knew it could humiliate you, with a stopwatch clicking like a polite gun. The first flight was joke-easy; the second thought about knees; the third tasted like pennies in my mouth; the fourth refused to be bribed. On the landing between two and three, Tamsin’s face appeared in the little window because she had finished paperwork early and couldn’t pretend not to watch. She did not cheer. She put her thumb up and then down and then left and then right, and I kept going because this is what you do for people who take the mick without making you small. At the top the tutor made a note that might have been You didn’t die, and I stood there with my hands on my thighs and looked at the skirting board until my lungs believed me.

We learned the inventory by touch in the way of magicians, reaching into bags to pull out triangular bandages and gloves with equal solemnity. We learned to talk to radios like we respected them but did not fear them, which is a voice I have never had for men. We learned how to tell the difference between someone who couldn’t breathe and someone who had forgotten how, and the tutor pursed her mouth at us until we stopped lying to ourselves about which was which. On day four a man came from fleet operations and gave us a talk about seat belts in a tone that suggested he had buried more idiots than friends, and then he told a joke that made me like him even as I promised not to be the punchline. By the end of the week my notebook looked like a page out of a drunk bird’s diary and I could put a cuff on without making it into a threat.

In the evenings, the city did the honest work of putting itself away and we did the same to our bodies. I would walk back along the front because walking back along the front has always been my compromise with sanity, and the water would practice being silver while the wind negotiated with gulls over who owns the air. Tamsin would meet me with her hair up and her, “What did you break,” and I would tell her about the man who came to teach us lifting and how his spine made a sermon out of not using your back like a hero. She had her own timetable now, three days a week in green at the care home on Milton Road where the corridors are carpet and the light is a fight, and two days telling men at venues that linen is not a personality. She did nights, sometimes, and came out with her mouth thin because old men don’t always want a woman to be the one who sees them small, and then she would soften the mouth for me because I am not the enemy and we would sit in Rena’s and let the quiz tell us we don’t know anything about rivers.

Rena tried falling over in February and we vetoed it at the committee stage. It wasn’t one of the big falls; it was a little theatrical stumble in the kitchen that broke nothing and made everything louder. She blamed the rug; the rug blamed gravity; I blamed the lack of sandwiches between breakfast and four. I did the dance with the blood pressure cuff while pretending the cuff was just a puppet we had made for our own amusement, and she tutted as if I had bought the wrong milk. “All right,” she said, approving only in the way that sounds like contempt. “You look like you know the shape of my arm. I don’t love that. Bring me water you’ve made important.” We salted the day with small good work and she was herself before the ad break, which is the measure that matters.

Dalloway won a thing and behaved about it. The ex-tenant had her day in a room with air that had been filtered for people who can afford it, and the judge got to feel like a father and a guillotine. We weren’t called to speak because there are lawyers who know how to make a morning out of a bruise, but we went anyway, sat at the back as if we were doing back-row church and let the words be done without us. After, on the pavement, Dalloway said, “Thank you,” with the particular politeness of men who have discovered their use for you is not a bottomless well, and for once he did not try to collect additional truths like shells. He bought Rena a bun that she pretended not to enjoy and he put money in a charity bucket with unnecessary emphasis and I resisted telling him that money is quieter when it knows what it’s for.

Kai moved in with the woman whose mother had the cat and found himself in arguments about spoons that thrilled him. He brought the plant to me on a Wednesday because it was dying under his affection, and I told him to stop misting it like a guilt, to leave it alone for a week and then praise it at odd intervals like a child who isn’t yours. He lay on my sofa and said, “Do you remember when we were sure that the problem with our lives was that nobody would let us? And now people let us and it’s worse,” and I made him a tea he did not drink and told him that letting is only the preface to doing. He has a way of being pleased when I sound like Rena that makes me want to become as old as the kettle on purpose.

The first big night on the back of a truck as not-nothing came with the moon pretending to be a coin you could spend. Adam had done his bemused face at the rota and Nic had already eaten three biscuits as insurance. They let me sit in the backwards chair and told me to flick the lights on my command like a child being allowed to be the DJ. We did the usuals and the not-quites and then the radio said a word in a tone I had not heard from it before. The word was stabbing and it is a stupid, small word for something that makes air leave a room. It was the kebab shop where men go to decide whether they can live with themselves, the one with the fluorescent that has seen more faces than a mirror.

On the pavement there was a boy bleeding in the way that makes sense and not sense; it had the pulse of anger rather than arteries and the sharp red of insult rather than exit. You can know this and still have your throat piss about it. The trick is to let your hands be the version of you that has always been better at being here than your head. Nic went straight in like a blade that heals and Adam did that hand-signal ballet I am learning to read, and I took the far side where the boy’s eyes were and made a wall out of my body so he didn’t have the shop window and his own reflection for company. “Look at me,” I said, and he said, “Don’t,” and I said, “Then look at my stupid vest and tell me why it’s stupid,” and he did, with competence. I described a weather front that had nothing to do with blood; I described a kettle in a kitchen that behaves when you look at it; I described a gull that I swore knew my name, and he calmed by degrees because his mouth had something to do. Tamsin arrived with a napkin she had bullied from a woman who thinks owning a mop is a personality, and she stood by my ear and said, “You’re not clever but you are useful. Don’t look down,” and I didn’t, and it didn’t kill me.

After, sitting on the step behind the shop with the smell of garlic and retreat in my clothes, I shook in the polite way that can pass for cold if you need it to. Nic shoved a biscuit in my mouth without asking because choice is not a tool in every drawer. “You didn’t sit down,” she said, impressed enough to let it show. “Or you did it on the inside. That counts. You’ll hate this job forever if you’re good at it and you’ll hate it more if you’re not. Find a method and have it ready.” Adam clinked his water bottle against mine like men briefly daring sentiment and told me a story about the first time he bled at work that ended in laughter because he knows that’s how to put the idea back in its box.

When we told Rena, she made the face she reserves for when we report danger as if it were gossip. She said, “No kebab shop in this town deserves your blood,” and then she fed us fish fingers like we were eight and well-behaved. Later she made me take a tin of plasters home “because I don’t like the ones they give you; they’re stingy with adhesive,” which is her way of blessing a profession. There is a religion in Rena that has nothing to do with God and everything to do with cupboards. If she had a cathedral it would smell of chip fat and bravery.

The day Tamsin got her start date in green she bought the sensible shoes that were promised me and they both looked at me like I was unworthy. She made me put them on and walk up and down her hallway while she clapped as if I were a horse she was pretending to be proud of. “You look like a man who could carry a chair without making it a sonnet,” she said, and then she looked at my face and softened without meaning to. “You still write the sonnet,” she added, quieter. “Just don’t do it in the stairwell.” We went to the Common because of course we did and the starlings had brought friends and the sky agreed to be half orange and half the sort of blue that makes old men remember wars they never fought in.

There are moments when the city joins in on your personal plot and you forgive it its bins. Adam phoned while we were watching the sky be complicated and told me, sounding like someone who had been volunteered, that the paper wanted to do a nothing story about community responders that would be made into something by the number of faces they could line up under a headline. “Do you want your ridiculous mouth under a strapline,” he said, and I said, “I am not a headline person,” and he said, “That’s why you should,” and Tamsin grabbed the phone and said, “He will, if I can choose the picture,” and Adam sighed like a man who knows he has lost to a principle larger than him and said Wednesday. We turned up to the photo like children told to stand still and be sincere, and the photographer made us do hands in pockets and hands out of pockets and stare off into the middle distance like we could see the future and it had given us permission. Later, the picture made me look like a person who might be helpful if you asked nicely, and Rena cut it out and put it on the fridge with the magnet that says Mind The Gap in case anyone forgot to.

Spring limped into town like a man carrying a sofa by himself, and with it came the wedding season proper. The Waverley had its carpets shampooed into civility and the Dockyard hired an extra man whose sole job was to be yelled at and then admired. We did a ceremony on the pier in a wind that despised hats and the bride’s veil made a play for the sea and I saw Tamsin calculate whether she could jump and be heroic without making it about her. She stayed, which felt like growth. The registrar said, “Do you,” and the couple said, “We do,” and the sea said, “I am busy,” and I collected glasses with the dignity of a man who was once a poet in his head and now thinks about washing up in a way that could make him cry.

On a Tuesday, as if my life were a film that had decided to be kind, I bumped into the nurse with the eyebrows from Tamsin’s bus story. It wasn’t the same nurse, of course; the NHS has hundreds of women with eyebrows like anger and mercy, but this one had something of the right shape and the right age and the right contempt for people who make fusses about things that could be solved with a sandwich. She was outside the surgery having an apple like it had personally offended her. I said, “Do you shout people into staying,” and she said, “Only those who want to go,” and I told her in a sideways way that she had an ancestor who saved someone I love by being unpleasant at the right time. She shrugged as if all she had done today was breathe, and then she told me not to hover near the bins because seagulls have learned faces and I am soft. It felt, walking away, like I had paid an overdue bill.

There was a call that was only sad. A house where the curtains were the wrong kind of drawn and a man had not woken up in the night, and there was nothing for anyone to do except make the room kinder to the dollop of living left behind. I did the voice and the tea and the find-a-chair-for-the-neighbour and the lies that are almost true. Adam did the paper and the radio and the weighing. Nic did the eyes at the door. The world had the gall to keep being itself and we packed up the smaller pieces of chaos and took them to the next address. That night, in my flat, the kettle didn’t sound enough like doom to be forgiven, and I sat with my back against the cupboard and told the dark I was here and meant it less than usual and then told it again and managed more.

On the day they gave me my uniform I stood in my kitchen and laughed like an idiot. It is not flattering, the green; it makes you look like a frog that believes in health and safety. It fit me in the way new clothes fit men who have spent years in charity shop trousers, which is to say approximately. I put it on and then took it off because I had forgotten deodorant, then put it on again and caught my reflection in the little mirror over the sink and didn’t hate the man looking back. Rena knocked and then came in without waiting because doors are a fad. She put her hands on my shoulders and said, “Look at you,” as if she had built me from leftovers. “Try not to get famous. It doesn’t suit our kind. You can get a small plaque on a wall one day if you insist, but not more. And bring the jacket back to me when it smells like other people’s houses so I can wash it properly; I don’t trust the powder you buy.”

When my first shift in green came up on the rota like a dare, the weather put on its expensive blue. Nic clapped as if we had invented the uniform and Adam cut his finger on a packet of saline and swore with admiration and then let me put a plaster on because symbol. We went out and did the honest things: a child with a marble up his nose who laughed when we made the siren noise with our mouths, a man whose dog had eaten his medication and required a lecture more than intervention, a woman who had mistaken the jitters for doom and apologised to us with cake. The radio said a word about a boat and my stomach tried to take a different bus and I ignored it. We were turned away halfway by a second crew more near, which is how the universe spares you some days.

There was a call near the Guildhall where a woman had cut her hand trying to dislodge a stubborn jar lid with a knife, which is a behaviour that should have a museum. She sat on her kitchen floor making the small moans you make when you have betrayed yourself, and the red was there, obviously, because knives like to make statements, and I felt my throat try the old trick and I breathed in the way the poster says to and I kept my eyes on the pattern of the lino in front of me. We joked about jam being a hate crime and I asked her to tell me about what she was making as if the menu could stitch her, and Nic had the dressing under control because of course she did. The woman laughed badly and then better and then said, “I don’t like the sight of my own,” as if anybody did, and we made plans for the jar that did not involve metal and she promised to store rage in a different cupboard next time. Walking back to the truck, Adam bumped my shoulder with his in a way that would have knocked me down a year ago and now just set me straight. “You didn’t go,” he said, and I said, “I wanted to,” and he said, “I always want to. That’s the labour. The trick is to give it no choice.”

Tamsin, in green on the days when weddings weren’t paying her to decide what flowers say about a person’s mother, began bringing home stories like stray cats. She told me about a woman who had called because her husband had stopped snoring for a night and she had panicked at the sudden quiet, and how they had sat and made tea and told the silence it was a blessing that didn’t need to be argued with. She told me about a man who refused to let them carry him down the stairs because he said it would be a slight to his father, who had died on his feet, and how she had persuaded him to perform masculinity on the chair with such grace that he had wept on arrival for relief. She told me about a child who put a plaster on Tamsin’s knee after Tamsin tripped over a toy train, very earnest, and told her the plasters work better on grown-ups because grown-ups don’t heal as fast, and I watched her fall a little in love with the idea of being corrected by toddlers.

One thin morning we found Arthur in the courtyard under the new steps, intact, arguing with a woman about the proper greeting for a neighbour you do not like. He nodded at me with the proprietorial air of a man who believes he invented gravity because he lost a fight with it once. “They’re better,” he said, jerking his chin at the stairs, and I said, “You sound disappointed,” and he said, “I prefer a world with hazards; keeps the young interesting,” and I did not tell him that the world will provide hazard without his curating it. He told me he had tried to imagine me in green and had failed and I said, “Me too,” and he laughed in a way that didn’t make me want to sit down.

Adam took me to the river where the ambulances rest between bad decisions and showed me a heron who spends afternoons pretending to be a stick. “He’s my favourite colleague,” he said. “He never radios in for back-up. He never writes a report longer than necessary. He is late to everything and nobody minds.” We were quiet for a long time, watching the bird stand, and then Adam said, casually enough to be rehearsal, “When people die on my watch, sometimes I make tea wrong for a week on purpose and let it punish me. Then I stop. That’s the whole ritual. You’ll need one.” I told him I already had the kettle in my house trained to be a confessor and he said, “Good. Don’t teach it Latin. It’ll get ideas.”

We went to a call in a shop where a boy had cut his scalp on a corner of a shelf because he had been running away from responsibility in the shape of a manager. Head wounds perform; they always have. There was a lot of red and I felt the familiar tilt and I did my work anyway. The boy was fine, mostly hair and theatre, but the colour did the tap dance behind my eyes and I had a second where the world went down a corridor I didn’t want. Nic said my name in the tone you use for men who have wandered off in supermarkets, and I came back, and I looked at the boy’s shoes because shoes are for knowing people without their blood, and I told him about the time I tried to work at a fish place and my boss told me to never drop a crab because a crab bears grudges, and he laughed his own blood off his face and asked me if I was making that up and I told him I never had to make up anything with claws.

There is a peace to the end of shift that feels like theft. You step back into the station with the taste of other people’s kitchens in your throat and you hang up your jacket like it has sinned. Nic took her hair down in one movement that felt like watching a kite come home and Adam washed a mug like it had tried to betray him and the radio clicked its tongue and let us go. I cycled home in the dark because bikes and I have an uneasy truce, and the Common looked like a sheet laid over the city by someone with bad folding. The foghorn did its single long note that always finds me, and I said my small superstition into my scarf like a man making weather. I am here. It’s a simple sentence that keeps meeting new rooms.

In May the city pretends to be a different country for a week and we all humour it. The fronts fill with men who think shorts are politics, and the ice cream van becomes a religion, and the pier is discussed as if it will always be there. Tamsin worked a wedding on the little strip of beach near the Canoe Lake where dogs feel superior, and I held a baby with the solemnity of a judge while the mother adjusted a bodice that hated her, and the baby’s eyes did the old soul trick that makes you believe in reincarnation while you’re holding a biscuit. The bride’s father gave a speech about how he had wanted his daughter to marry someone who would teach her to be late less, and the groom pointed at his watch with a grin that made me briefly generous towards men. After, by the bins that smell of fish and redemption, Tamsin leaned her head on my shoulder like a cat who is resting because the flight to attack will be resumed shortly. “We’re building something that isn’t a wall,” she said, almost annoyed by her own sentiment, and I said, “A jetty,” and she said, “Don’t get maritime on me,” and then she kissed me on the corner of my mouth in a way that could be explained away by both of us later, which we did not.

If chaptering is a habit, then this felt like the one where the author takes a breath and lets people make tea. Dalloway didn’t call because he was busy with a sinkhole, which is not a metaphor; the Council had found itself with a literal hole and nobody wanted to own it. Kai sent me a photo of the plant surviving and his face beside it like a before and after, and I told him to stop congratulating the plant and start informing it of rent. Rena baked a traybake she refused to name and foisted half on the neighbour she sometimes loathes and sometimes loves, and I watched her invent community with pastry because that is the only way it sticks in this town. Adam cried at a stupid advert for a bank and pretended he had something in his eye, and I pretended to believe him because that is friendship.

The stairs in my head were dustier. They still arrive when I am not being careful, and the scarf is still red, and the sound is still fully itself, but the scene has been interrupted often enough now by a kettle or a pager or a woman with eyebrows that refuse death that it has lost its monopoly. When they come, I sometimes imagine Tamsin on the landing putting her hand through the glass and making faces, and in that imagining the sound is not the last word, just a note in a song I am learning to hum without being sick. It is not healing. It is not a cure. It is a practice. It is a way of letting the city’s noise teach me a tune I can use elsewhere.

One night we went to the seafront for our own reasons and found the sky had decided to show off, a red that had taken anger and turned it into permission. People took photographs like they were proof, and a man proposed to a woman with a ring that the gulls approved, and three teenagers tried to get a barbecue to confess it was a bad idea and failed. We stood with chips and vinegar and the wind telling us we would regret this and didn’t, and Tamsin said, “I thought living was going to be a bigger thing,” and I said, “It is; you’re just inside it,” and she put her hand in my pocket and left it there because some questions are answered by lazy anatomy. The water did its show and then went back to being itself, and that is the lesson I want for us. We can be everything for a minute and then we can be ordinary and it will not mean we are less.

On the way home we passed the steps where Arthur fell and where the tape once sagged like hope before becoming work, and there was a girl sitting halfway down, the age where the world is a mirror with fingerprints. She had her knees up and her face hidden in that way that says, leave or try, and Tamsin, who bargains with heaven without believing in it, said, “Tea,” like a prayer. We sat three stairs down so she didn’t have to look down to look at us and we listened and didn’t make it about us. It was not a drama you could sell; it was a father who had used his voice badly and a mother who had used her silence worse and a school that had marks and no memory. We gave her the number for someone who answers phones without sighing and we told her she could always come and be bored at Rena’s on quiz night because boredom can be a medicine, and she almost smiled, which is a currency I am learning to respect. When we left, the steps looked less like a machine for correction and more like a place to sit, which is all I ever wanted for them.

If you ask me what chapter ten is about, I might say it’s the one where the shoes fit without needing to apologise. It’s the one where “I am here” started to be true in rooms I didn’t choose and the rooms did not throw me out. It’s the one where Tamsin found a green that looked like audacity on her and wore it to make men be quiet in hallways. It’s the one where Rena sat at her table and said grace without naming anyone and meant it with crumbs on her lip. It’s the one where the city didn’t soften so much as agree to coexist, and the gulls stopped being a metaphor and went back to being thieves, and the sea pretended to be impressed with us for an evening and then got on with the old work. It’s the one where, at the end, I stood at my sink with the mirror that never lies and told it out loud again and heard the sentence put on a bit of weight. I am here. It still felt like an exaggeration. It also felt like a plan.
