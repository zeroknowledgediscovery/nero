     "novel_text": "The morning I decided to betray my profession for something wilder than precedent, the air over Meridian tasted like warm copper and magnolia syrup. The courthouse steps sweated, and the big clock above the clerk\u2019s office seemed to tick in lumps. Meridian has always been a town that wears its history like a suit a shade too tight. Threads show around the elbows. People pretend they don\u2019t notice.\n\nI\u2019d been practicing law a decade by then, which is to say I\u2019d learned to hold my breath while rooms filled with other people\u2019s stenched-up grievances. I did divorces, property disputes, a few slips and falls\u2014nothing heroic, nothing that left much of a mark except where it rubbed me thin. Outside my office window the train tracks buzzed, and the sky broke into its usual fragile blue. Clients liked to see that blue; juries liked to have it in their periphery. They were teddy-bear folk that way, needing softness somewhere even if all they got was color.\n\nMy name is Barrett, though most of Meridian still calls me Barry despite all my efforts to age into something crisper. I\u2019m tall when I remember to stand right. Some days the cuff of my shirt will catch on a drawer and I\u2019ll feel an unreasonable irritation, a tug, as if some stitch of me is not properly hidden. You\u2019ll laugh; I do not. The best lawyers are the ones who distrust their own seams.\n\nIt was a Tuesday, which is the day of the week where the courthouse coffee tastes like burnt molasses and news of small disasters trickles in from every direction. I was sitting with a man named Oakes in my conference room, discussing the relative merits of keeping his father\u2019s violin or selling it to pay down the lien on the house, when the call came from the hospital. Oakes ran his hand over the back of his neck the way you check for a price tag in a store. That habit survives even in grief.\n\n\u201cGo on,\u201d he told me, after I\u2019d tried to ignore the call twice. \u201cYou\u2019re no good to me pretending I matter more than whatever that is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis matters,\u201d I said automatically. Then I picked up the call. It was Dr. Darla Kettering, the oncologist I\u2019d met pro bono at one of those grim do-gooder panels lawyers sit on to feel less like barnacles.\n\n\u201cMr. Barrett,\u201d she said, skipping my last name because the speaker phone in her office always made mine sound like I\u2019d made it up. \u201cDo you have a minute today or are you in trial?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a client in the room,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I can call you back.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about your mother,\u201d she said, and that cut the air sideways and left me with a ridiculous sweet taste in my mouth, what you taste when cotton gets wet. It had been four years since my mother died, and still that word could pull the room like a rug, drag everything toward its center.\n\n\u201cGive me an hour,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll hold lunch,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou won\u2019t want to rush this.\u201d\n\nAfter I walked Oakes to his truck and told him to keep the violin no matter what anyone else suggested\u2014some objects hold a person-shaped space no court can measure\u2014I drove out to Saint Rose. The hospital\u2019s new wing still had that fresh paint smell that made my nose itch, clean and artificial, like talc sprinkled too thick in a child\u2019s dresser. In the elevator, I could hear my pulse pattering like someone tapping a loose button on a table. The metal walls threw my reflection back at me with a wobble. I rubbed my thumb over my wrist bone. I stopped. The doors slid open.\n\nDarla met me in the hallway and hugged me like we\u2019d already shared something heavy and rough. She was short, with steady, quick eyes and a laugh that could talk anyone off a ledge if she timed it right. She ushered me into her office, where the books looked like they had plastic covers on them that my eye couldn\u2019t quite focus on. For a moment, I thought of my mother\u2019s sewing basket, the tiny jars of buttons and the strawberry-shaped pincushion heavy with metal.\n\n\u201cYou told me you didn\u2019t want to be updated on her file,\u201d Darla began gently. \u201cI know that. But I found something in relation to another patient.\u201d\n\n\u201cFound something.\u201d My voice came out more like an accusation than the question I intended. Lawyers adopt their tones like borrowed suits.\n\n\u201cWe keep the data,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all vote to. It\u2019s anonymized. But you made me curious, Barrett. The way you said\u2014at the funeral\u2014that you were sorry you didn\u2019t understand earlier what kind of thing took her. It stuck with me. Probably not fair. Anyway, this is me being unfair. Sit down.\u201d\n\nI sat. She pushed a thin folder toward me, paper clip holding pages in that brutal tight way, a little tension you can feel through your nails.\n\n\u201cMy patient\u2019s name is Tinsley,\u201d she said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t respond to standard chemo. I wanted to try off-label something with her, and I compared her markers to archived cases. Your mother\u2019s profile is\u2014was\u2014similar. They had a particular damaged loop on chromosome 17. You don\u2019t care about the number. Point is, a drug used for a completely different disease lights up that segment.\u201d\n\n\u201cLights up as in cures?\u201d I said, trying not to lean too far toward the nonsense of hope.\n\n\u201cLights up as in arrests cell lines in vitro, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cIn patients, we have complications. Immune stuff. But listen to me. There\u2019s one more twist. Your mother was given a routine antibiotic near the end when she got an infection. Her white count did something weirder than any white count I have seen. For forty-eight hours, her blast cells stopped replicating.\u201d\n\nI heard this like you hear the phrase, \u201cI found a door,\u201d in a house where you\u2019d lived for years and never looked behind a piece of furniture. \u201cDid anyone notice?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at the time,\u201d she said. \u201cShe was too ill. She had too many other processes failing. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd this other patient? Tinsley?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dosed her with an antibiotic last week,\u201d Darla said. \u201cShe is stable. This is not supposed to work like this. But there is perhaps a synergy. I\u2019ll say the ugly word: cure. Or cure-adjacent. I know I am stepping out of the lines telling you. But I\u2019m telling you because you strike me as the kind of person who doesn\u2019t like lines when they\u2019re arbitrary.\u201d\n\nI stared down at the photocopies, the graphs like low mountains, the months spread in numeric digits. The letters of the antibiotic\u2019s name looked like something I\u2019d seen scrawled on a napkin or a prescription bottle in a joke. The name was old-fashioned and sweet. I thought of my mother muttering to herself over her quilting, the way she\u2019d tug fabric and iron it and then, hold it up to my chest as if measuring something only she understood.\n\n\u201cIf this is real,\u201d I said. \u201cIf this is anything other than a fluke\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be just ours,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cIt would need to be tested, shared, repeated. I brought it to the board. They\u2026 we. They want to wait. There are liability issues. There is the possibility of false hope. There is the hospital\u2019s relationship with donors whose children died. It\u2019s complicated.\u201d\n\nIn the stillness after that word I heard a deep sound like a low cello under the normal beep of the hall monitors. Meridian likes everything to be simple or at least pretend simple. Complicated gets you called arrogant.\n\n\u201cYou want me to sue your hospital into giving your patient an antibiotic I can get at a CVS?\u201d I said. It came out ugly because I needed someone to be angry at.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI want you to talk to Tinsley\u2019s family. To explain the risk. To give me cover to do what I already did.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou already did,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cTwice,\u201d she said, and there was a little smile at the edge of her mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t you find it strange that an oncologist has to ask a lawyer to help her be brave?\u201d\n\nIt was then, thinking of bravery like an object we could both hold, that I felt something else happen. A looseness in my chest, like a seam let out. I could tell you I became a different man in that second, but it\u2019s more accurate to say I started telling a different story about myself. Lawyers are trained story-tellers. Cancer is a story people choke on; we smooth our throats and try again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d I said. \u201cTell me about the family.\u201d\n\nThe Tinsleys turned out to be from the north end of the county, a place of red clay and neighborhoods stacked in with more care than their builders had money for. Their daughter was named Joy, which seemed either bold or cruel, depending on how cynical you were that day. She had hair like unlucky wheat and eyes that made you check to see if your own pupils worked.\n\nJoy listened to me like she\u2019d been practicing for it. Her father, Earl, sat in silence, a demolished man with hands like paddles. Her mother wore a scarf with cartoon oranges on it and kept folding it like there was a right way she might eventually arrive at if she just respected the fabric. When I told them what Darla suspected, a kind of bird-wary hope skittered through the room. Later, when I would talk on the news, people would write that my voice carried \u201cinappropriate enthusiasm.\u201d But in a small room, with a girl holding a cup of melt-water and trying to decide whether to risk a drug that might kill her, enthusiasm is not a sin. It is the only thing that doesn\u2019t feel like betrayal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to die,\u201d Joy said to me simply, and I put my hands on the table because sometimes you have to keep them where you can see them.\n\n\u201cYou might not have to,\u201d I said. \u201cNot this month. Maybe not this year.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just a lawyer,\u201d Earl blurted. Then closed his eyes, ashamed, his lower lip trembling like a seam pulling tight. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry is a spell that works on fabric,\u201d my mother used to say when she ripped out stitches. \u201cIt relaxes the thread.\u201d I looked at Joy, then at Darla. \u201cYour daughter will sign the consent. I will co-sign my name as a witness. The hospital can do what it needs to do with its fears.\u201d\n\nIt should have been enough. In another town, in another lifetime, it might have been. But Meridian has its kings, and men like me are not supposed to crown anybody. That afternoon, I got my first phone call from the district attorney\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cMr. Barrett,\u201d said the voice like ice water. \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d\n\nOf course I remembered him. Sloan Greaves and I had battled over small matters for years: a petty fraud my client had not committed, a brawl in a parking lot where I\u2019d argued the merits of a bruised nose, the politics of a case the newspaper thought smelled good and I thought smelled like smoke from wet cloth. Sloan had an angular face and the kind of hair people in Protestant churches admire, because it looks like it would never betray him and fall in his eyes at the wrong time. We were civil the way two men can be who want to be seen being civil, but we were not friends. In law school, he\u2019d been the golden boy who could recite twenty cases and their holdings without blinking. I, by contrast, once forgot the name of the judge in open court and called him \u201cYour Honor Sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cAssistant District Attorney Greaves,\u201d I said, because he always preferred the full title, perhaps because it sounded like he was one crowded heartbeat away from the main chair. \u201cHow can I serve the People this afternoon?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a complaint,\u201d he said. \u201cA doctor practicing outside accepted protocols. Colluding with a plaintiff\u2019s attorney to deprive the hospital of its shield of reasonableness.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been reading from the tort book,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my best genre.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot reading. Remembering,\u201d he said, and I could hear his smile rubbing the receiver. \u201cThere are also the matters of marketing claims. I hear you\u2019re about to call a press conference. Unwise.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m about to sign a consent form for a patient you and I will never meet,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m about to drive across town and hold a hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m about to file a motion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will seek to enjoin the hospital from deviating from standard of care without approval of the board. It will name you in the narrative. It will\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t enjoin hope,\u201d I said. The line was too dramatic, and I hated myself for it. He sighed like I\u2019d missed an easy layup.\n\n\u201cYou can, in fact, enjoin acts,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can enjoin a person from taking steps dangerous to the public. And you can bury your reputation in papers so thick your wrists ache holding them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that you being afraid for me, Sloan?\u201d I asked, because one of us had to say his name and I wanted to be the one to move us out of formalities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s me being afraid for the town,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re stirring up, Barry. Meridian looks quiet until it isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAfter we hung up, I sat at my desk and looked at my hands again. You do it when you\u2019re nervous; you take inventory. A tiny burr of fabric clung to my knuckle. I pinched it off. Once, when I was a boy, a seam burst on my favorite bear. My mother took me gently by the wrist, sat me down at the kitchen table, and took out a needle. \u201cHold still,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep what\u2019s inside inside.\u201d\n\nMemory is cruel; it will hurl you face-first into a simple domestic scene and then shove you, suddenly, into a fluorescent hallway where everything smells like disinfectant and fear. I stood up. I went back to Saint Rose. People in scrubs were moving like lightning disguised as people.\n\nJoy took the antibiotic. She did not die. Her numbers slid toward normal the way a needle glides into a comfortable groove. Darla gripped my shoulder once, in the hall, so hard I saw stars, her fingers digging like she had found the little stiff patches of my coat and wanted to test them for structure. \u201cWe need to be careful,\u201d she whispered, and I nodded because I knew she meant more than medicine.\n\nWhen the story came out\u2014as of course it had to\u2014it came out not because I called a press conference, but because Meridian loves a secret so much it will run into the street and scream its lungs out to keep the pressure down. A cousin told an aunt who told a pastor who told a barber who told a speech therapist. By morning, the mailbox of my office had comments like confetti. People brought pies. People brought sharp questions. People brought the kind of low, ugly whispers a small place feeds on when it\u2019s hungry.\n\n\u201cYou think you found a cure?\u201d asked a man in a hardware store, leaning across the counter until he fogged the plexiglass with his breath. \u201cYou really think God likes you that much?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we learned something,\u201d I said, trying to be mild. He shoved a box of screws toward me harder than necessary, then smiled like we were friends again. I paid. I walked to my truck. The sun hit the hood so hard I thought it might melt me and pour me down into the street like syrup.\n\nIf I had known what was coming, would I have done it differently? I sometimes tell myself I would have kept to the shadows longer. But that\u2019s a lie. The second week, we found two more patients whose charts winked at Darla\u2019s hunch. The antibiotic\u2014ordinary, cheap\u2014paired with a generic cancer drug, was doing something unlicensed and gleeful in their blood. The third week, a nurse emailed me anonymously to say she believed her brother had the same markers. The email had typos and a little heart at the end, like she couldn\u2019t decide if she was being a scientist or a friend.\n\nThen the board suspended Darla\u2019s privileges.\n\nIt happened in a room with glass walls and a long table and a jug of water with lemon and mint leaves floating like drowned ornaments. I stood at one end, in a jacket that felt too new, the weave too obvious. Darla stood at the other end. The chairman of the board, a man named Olan McCreedy whose family owned half the banks and all the respect, neatly arranged his notes like he was dealing cards in a game he knew he would win.\n\n\u201cYou have put us in a difficult position, Doctor Kettering,\u201d he said. \u201cThis hospital cannot be a laboratory.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis town dies when we pretend it is not,\u201d she said, without heat. \u201cPeople die all the time while we protect our own.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re unrepentant,\u201d said McCreedy, softly, as if he were noting the weather.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m right,\u201d she said.\n\nThey voted. The motion carried. She lost her keys. She lost the access a doctor needs to do what she knows how to do.\n\nWhen we came outside, the sky had gone that bruised color it gets before a thunderstorm, yellowish at the edges, like an old book that\u2019s been thumbed too much. Darla laughed to keep her face from breaking.\n\n\u201cNow what?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNow you do what you do,\u201d she said. \u201cNow you file something.\u201d\n\nI did. I filed with anger and with care. I wrote so meticulously my fingers cramped and the pads of them felt hot. My sentences had sharp openings and easy landings. I filed asking the court to require the hospital to adopt as emergency protocol what we had seen in three patients in Meridian and another two at a clinic Darla had whispered to in Alabama. I pulled every string I knew. I wrote like a man who could sew with paper.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll come for you first,\u201d warned my friend Pil, who worked at the radio station and knew where the stories in town hid and how often they fed. \u201cIt\u2019ll be rough.\u201d\n\nHe was right. The merchants stopped smiling when I walked by. Letters to the editor spelled my name in creative ways. A cartoon appeared with my head on a bottle of snake oil. A man in a truck rolled down his window outside the courthouse and shouted, \u201cBarrett, you\u2019re a danger to people who love their families,\u201d and then, seeing my face, added in an embarrassed voice, \u201cNo offense.\u201d\n\nSloan filed his motion to enjoin. He wore a tie the color of money and a look like he had eaten something too rich and couldn\u2019t let himself burp because it would look common. In the hearing, he delivered his lines with ease. The judge liked him. The judge\u2019s grand-niece had married his cousin, and that counted for something even if we all pretended the court did not notice such little stitches connecting things.\n\n\u201cMr. Greaves is asking this court to do the opposite of what he claims,\u201d I told the judge when it was my turn. \u201cHe wants to turn the standard of care into a padlock, when it was meant to be a belt. He wants to strap us so tight we can\u2019t breathe. And my client\u201d\u2014I gestured toward Joy, who sat in the back row with a scarf on her head, smiling at something Darla had said under her breath\u2014\u201cjust wants to live a little more.\u201d\n\n\u201cCounsel,\u201d said the judge, half-exasperated, half-pleased at the theater. \u201cDo not manipulate the gallery.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of it,\u201d I said, and then I dreamt of it that night, very vividly.\n\nThe court delayed. The town talked. The newspaper could not decide if I was a savior or a salesman. A vigil appeared on the courthouse lawn, candles in paper cups glowing at the bases of the benches, notes tucked under stones with names written in earnest block letters. One morning, as if Meridian decided at last that my fate should be decided by a coin toss, the Post Office declared it would hold a forum for all \u201cinterested parties\u201d on \u201cthe issue of non-standard medical propaganda.\u201d The Post Office is where you go in Meridian to buy stamps, mail grievance, and announce your intention to serve society. We gathered there on a Wednesday between the hours of two and four, under fluorescent bulbs that hum in a way that makes your teeth feel slightly looser than you would prefer.\n\nSloan stood up first and spoke like a hymn. He had been captain of the debate team in high school and, it is said, dated the prettiest girl in the county for a while, long enough to make her parents believe he could be part of their lineage. He told us all about safety, about process, about law as a way to equalize luck and not the opposite. People nodded. He said the word \u201creckless\u201d like it was a personal insult to him, and three women made the same face at the same time in the front row, a kind of flinch you only get when you are frightened and attracted at once.\n\nWhen it was my turn, I began in a voice too soft for a room that size. It was all wrong. I could feel the thread slipping in my hands. Pil motioned from the back to project. Darla put her hands over her eyes for a second, then took them away like she was unseeing the person she saw me turning into. Joy sat next to her, and her smile never faltered, even when I fumbled the statistics, even when I said \u201cchromosome 7\u201d and then had to correct it to 17 and someone tittered like a child in church who had been told not to laugh.\n\n\u201cForgive me,\u201d I said finally, abandoning whatever script I had been trying to knit. \u201cI am not a scientist. I am a man who watched his mother\u2019s mouth go slack in a hospital and never quite recovered. I am someone who sees in the law not a glass shield but a mesh. It keeps out the big things and lets the air through. I want us to be able to breathe. Maybe you think I\u2019m the wrong person to ask you to trust this. Maybe I\u2019m the right one.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a great speech, but it was mine, and Meridian does have a fondness for authenticity, which it mistakes for art all the time. The room softened. People began to look at me like I was something alive and not just a cautionary tale.\n\n\u201cI know you,\u201d said a voice then, and I turned. An old man I\u2019d defended on a traffic ticket eight years ago stood up, his suspenders tight on his shoulders. \u201cYou kept me from losing my license. I drive my wife to church every Sunday. Don\u2019t let them tell you not to help folks. You help folks.\u201d\n\nThat was when Sloan did something he\u2019d never done in a public room before: he let his energy drop. He looked tired. He leaned against the wall like he couldn\u2019t quite feel his edges. He has a scar on his wrist most people don\u2019t notice; I noticed it now. He caught my eye and then, before anyone else could, he turned to the side, and I swear to you, he hummed\u2014just a fraction of a tune, aimless at first and then resolving, as if he were finding a melody.\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d said the Postmaster, because the clock on the wall had reached four and his power is absolute when it comes to closing time. \u201cNo more statements. We have heard our community.\u201d\n\nWe filed out. The sun had lowered and the heat felt less like a punishment and more like the tail end of some mercy. I looked for Darla. She had a habit of vanishing when she had to cry; I suspected she\u2019d stolen away to the alley to compose herself. Sloan came up beside me silently, so close I could smell the starch in his shirt and a faint, unexpected scent of cedar.\n\n\u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d he said. \u201cNot here.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo many witnesses?\u201d I asked, unable to resist.\n\n\u201cToo much noise,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s music under this we\u2019re not hearing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou going to sing it out for me?\u201d I said, and meant it as a joke. He didn\u2019t smile.\n\nHis office lives in a building that used to be a hat store. The ceiling is high and heavy and the light wired and old. He unlocked the door. Inside, it is quieter than any other place in Meridian, as if the building took its promise of secrecy seriously. He went to his desk and opened a drawer. He took out something I did not recognize at first\u2014sheet music. Blank measures printed lightly, and a pencil with a chewed-up eraser, and a small black metronome that ticked even when you didn\u2019t wind it if the air conditioner blew right on it.\n\n\u201cYou play?\u201d I said, surprised at how personal the question felt, and how sloppily it fell out of my mouth.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to write. We all have something we used to do, yes?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, thinking of how I used to sleep.\n\n\u201cMy father wanted me to win,\u201d he said. \u201cMusic isn\u2019t a winning thing in Meridian. It\u2019s a quiet thing. Quiet things get eaten.\u201d\n\nI waited for the but. It didn\u2019t arrive. He sat down, then stood immediately, then sat again like a man who had never learned what his body preferred. He looked at me carefully, as if reading notes on a page and trying to hear the chord.\n\n\u201cYou think you\u2019ve found a way to cure cancer,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think Darla did,\u201d I said. \u201cYou can call it an algorithm if you want. It\u2019s big and small at once. It\u2019s a combination of old things in a new way. It\u2019s sewing pieces that didn\u2019t look like they belonged.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, impatient at himself. He drummed his fingers once on the wooden desk.\n\n\u201cI can let you keep going,\u201d he said. \u201cOr I can stop you cold.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d I began, but he raised his hand.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do either alone,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not the judge. But I can orchestrate. I can make the song that plays in the judge\u2019s ear or the board\u2019s ear. You know this. You resent it.\u201d He closed his eyes for a moment and said, almost too softly to hear, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be that man anymore.\u201d\n\nIt was my turn to be silent. He kept his eyes closed like a person about to leap.\n\n\u201cI wake up,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd all I see are measures. Four by four. Six by eight. Things that can hold sound. But I put words in them instead of notes, and they cut people. I\u2019m tired, Barrett. My son\u2014did you know I had a son?\u2014he sits on the carpet and bangs on a toy piano with his palms and shrieks with joy, real joy, not the kind our Joy plays at for our sakes, and I think, why would I not want to be as close to that as possible with whatever time I get.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d I asked, and hated how hungry I sounded.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m moving.\u201d\n\nHe looked scared of the confession. He looked like the first time I\u2019d seen one of Joy\u2019s numbers move toward the unthinkable. Beautiful. Dangerous. I should have said something. Thank you, perhaps. Or I\u2019m sorry. Or Let me help. Instead, I stared stupidly at the pencil and the metronome and at his hands, wondering at the long, narrow fingers, the nails unbelievably neat, the cuticles trimmed just so, the ridges like the faintest stitched line from thumb to forefinger where the skin should be thicker and is not.\n\n\u201cMy wife says it\u2019s a midlife crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cI told her crises are for the young. The old have transformations.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not old,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI feel very old,\u201d he said. He smiled then, finally, a smile that felt like something unpinned inside him and fell to the floor softly. \u201cI don\u2019t expect you to forgive me for everything I\u2019ve done. But I want you to hear one more thing. There are people in this town with a stake you have not yet met. Men whose shirts smell like warehouses and the inside of new cars. They like things the way they are. They like their stories quiet, and their little risks compartmentalized and their dividends predictable. They will hurt you. I don\u2019t know how. They\u2019ll figure out a way that doesn\u2019t look unseemly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, truly. The words landed between us like a square of fabric, and we both looked at it like we were trying to decide what to make out of it.\n\nI left his office and the evening felt more like a corridor than a sky. The whole town a hallway, the streetlights little stitches tacked along the edges. My phone vibrated. A text from Darla: they had tapped her home phone, she thought, because someone had called asking specific questions about Tinsley\u2019s dosage; she had called the number back and got only a recorded voice. I told her to come to my office. I told her to bring Joy if she could.\n\nThey came together, mother and daughter and doctor and fear, and we sat in my conference room with the ceiling fan clicking slightly on one blade\u2014click at each turn, click like a metronome misaligned. Joy fell asleep in the chair with her hands folded in her lap, palms up, fingers loose like she was holding air.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to do this,\u201d Darla said, a confession so childlike I loved her for it. \u201cIt\u2019s like I was taught one story and then, mid-way, someone told me there was a better plot and I had to begin again without losing my place.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing it,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s how it feels.\u201d\n\nShe nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking to a lab in Jackson that can culture the cell lines and run this faster. If we move it out of Meridian for the beat, it\u2019s less\u2014visible.\u201d She said the word like it was damp cloth. \u201cWe might lose equity.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing about this is equitable,\u201d I said.\n\nWe were quiet. The town hummed around us, a thing with a thousand stitched mouths. Outside, a train passed, its horn drawn out and slow. Joy stirred and murmured something I didn\u2019t catch, then slept deeper, her head falling to the side, an angle that would have hurt me; she looked comfortable.\n\nI admired her scarf. It was a pattern of little gold stars and something else I could not name. I went closer and then felt rude and stepped back. I have a terrible urge to touch fabric when I see it, to feel the grain, to note the thickness. My mother could tell, even on days when I swore I was being discreet. \u201cHands that crave cloth,\u201d she would tease, her needle flashing in the kitchen lamplight. \u201cYou\u2019ll be a tailor.\u201d I became a lawyer. Which is a kind of tailor. My suits have always been a fraction too sharp at the shoulders, so I remember they\u2019re on my body.\n\nAt midnight, after they\u2019d gone, I stood in the doorway of my office and listened to the cicadas perform their simple, arrogant symphony. I thought of Sloan at his desk with an empty staff and a pencil, of the DA\u2019s office, of his reputation like a gold frame around a painting that might be empty. I thought of men in rooms with glass walls, their voices smooth as oiled wood. I thought of my mother\u2019s hands. The world was a garment and somebody had to do the repairs.\n\nOn my walk home, the streetlights haloed in the wet air, I passed E.J.\u2019s 24-hour and saw, through the window, a little boy hugging a bear so worn its fur was almost matte, its plush flattened into a dense patience. I stopped. I don\u2019t know why. The boy pressed his nose into the bear\u2019s head, and his eyes closed, and his small mouth made a shape that was not quite a smile and not quite a prayer.\n\nI went to sleep with my phone on the pillow, a thing I advise none of my clients to do. Around three in the morning, I woke with a start, certain someone had said my name. Only the air conditioner. Only the fans spinning, threads of air in a dark room. I got up, walked to the kitchen, poured water with an unsteady hand. I caught sight of myself in the reflection of the window. Even in the smudged glass, I could see exhaustion had tucked itself into the corners of my eyes. I rubbed them and felt a small roughness under the skin, like felt. I startled, hissed, laughed at myself. Weirdness visits at three a.m. like a cat that knows which house will get up to feed it.\n\nIn the morning there was an envelope under my door. No stamp. Thick, off-white, like a formal invitation had been repurposed for something less charming. Inside, a single page: if you do not stop we will open you. The letters were cut from a magazine from the seventies or maybe someone with a sense of theater had sought such. I ran my thumb along the edge of the paper and got a sensation like you get when you snag on a tag and it pulls where there is no skin to pull. It was a good threat. Efficient. The grinning cruelty of a child with scissors.\n\nI brought Darla the note. I brought Sloan an image of it. I brought my fear to the mirror and looked at it until it looked back like an old friend. Then I put on my jacket and stood straight in it, and I drove to see Joy with a bouquet of something not too sweet, daises maybe, because lilies have too much funeral in them and roses are for apologies we cannot afford.\n\n\u201cYou always bring the wrong flowers,\u201d Joy teased when I knocked, and I felt myself turn into the person Meridian claimed I was. \u201cIt\u2019s OK. I like wrong.\u201d\n\nOn the way back to the truck, a man leaned against the hood and smiled into my face. His teeth were too straight; his shirt had a sheen to it I recognized from catalogues where the fabric is described with untrue, hopeful adjectives. Behind him stood two other men, their hands folded neatly in front as if they had been practicing docility and could turn it off if asked. The smiling man tapped my fender lightly with his knuckles, a gesture that says, We know how to make noise, and also, We can be quiet.\n\n\u201cWe like order,\u201d he said without introducing himself. \u201cWe like it when doctors wait their turn. We like it when lawyers do not make themselves prophets. You should go on a vacation, Barry\u2014I can call you Barry, right?\u2014and when you return, this will all be over, one way or another.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeridian is the size of a hand,\u201d I said, before I could stop myself. \u201cYou can\u2019t take a vacation from your own fingers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can cut them off,\u201d he said pleasantly, and his friends laughed as if he\u2019d told a droll joke in the car ride over and they were delighted to hear it again. \u201cDon\u2019t bring the DA into this. He\u2019s going through something delicate and musical.\u201d\n\nThe way he said musical held contempt and disbelief and a pinch of curiosity, like music was a rumor he couldn\u2019t quite squash. The three men stepped away in unison, like a little dance. They left without saying good-bye, and I stood there in the sun, my shadow a piece of punctuation on the pavement, wondering if I had time to become a better sort of brave.\n\nThat night, Sloan called me and didn\u2019t speak for ten seconds. Then, faintly, like he was in another house and didn\u2019t want to wake anyone, he said, \u201cI wrote something.\u201d\n\n\u201cA brief?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cA song,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not good yet. But it moved air in the room. I thought you should know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d I said, and I did not know whether I meant I was glad for him, for me, or for the air.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the town will try to close us. There are ways to stay open. I\u2019m learning them. They\u2019re not in the books.\u201d\n\nBefore I could answer, he hung up. I sat there with the phone pulling heat from my palm, amazed at the sudden, wrong-turn feeling of it all, at how the map now included places we had pretended were not in our county. My chest ached with a small, familiar pain. I pressed my fist against it and felt my body complain. At the table, the stack of pleadings I\u2019d planned to finish had slipped slightly, the edges misaligned. I straightened them, glided my palm over until they clicked into a perfect rectangle, then left them crooked on purpose. It looked like life.\n\nIn the morning, a letter from a small clinic in Jackson sat waiting in my email. They wanted to see our data. They wanted to try the protocol. They had found two patients with fourteen matching markers. They sent me a spreadsheet so beautifully arranged I felt a childish wish to touch it, to smooth it as if smoothing could carry over to the cells in those bodies. I wrote back yes. I wrote back we are with you. I wrote back Sorry for any delay in my response, I was standing in the kitchen trying to figure out if bravery is a pantry item you can run out of.\n\nOn the refrigerator, a magnet held a photograph of my mother next to me at a fair, both of us sticky with candy, her hand on my head like she wanted to be sure it was still there. The edge of the photo had begun to curl. I pressed it flat. \u201cWe\u2019re doing it,\u201d I told her. On the street outside, a truck downshifted with a noise like ripping. The day rose around us, all the unseen fastenings doing their quiet work.Chapter 3\n\nThe morning after the Jackson email, Meridian wore a sky so clean it felt like a deception. It had rained in the night\u2014hard, vertical rain that made the magnolia leaves shine like they\u2019d been lacquered by a feverish artisan\u2014and now everything looked scrubbed, as if the town had been reminded it has a face and decided to wash. I shaved and nicked myself because my hand wandered thinking of other kinds of edges, then pressed toilet paper to the dot of blood like a man attempting first aid on a painting. In the window, the reflection of my jawline went in and out with the clouds. I wanted to call someone about how beautiful it all was and then remembered beauty only makes sense to people who already share your ridiculous faith in it.\n\nPil called first anyway, and he never bothered with preambles unless he wanted something big. He spoke in a whisper because his station manager, whom he did not respect but did not wish to offend, believed whispers signaled important news and Pil liked to make him feel included. He said the Jackson clinic wanted me on-air to talk about \u201ccommunity-sourced innovation,\u201d which is a phrase I distrust and a concept I was beginning to live inside of whether or not I liked what the walls were made of. I told him no, then yes, then I said give me an hour and I\u2019d drive over to Saint Rose to see Joy first and he could catch me on the way back if the station\u2019s personas required me to sound like I hadn\u2019t rehearsed.\n\n\u201cSay less science,\u201d Pil advised, and then coughed. \u201cSay more mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe town already knows mine better than I do,\u201d I said, but he was right and we both knew it. He makes a decent living reminding people of the stories they already repeated to themselves before bed.\n\nDarla met me at the back entrance because her badge no longer opened the side doors and she refused to be escorted by a guard who used to bring her cupcakes from his wife on Fridays. She wore her white coat over a blue dress that was too nice for what it would see that day, and she\u2019d pinned her hair back tight, the kind of aggressive practicality women are forced to choose when they\u2019re worried a wrong curl will be mistaken for frivolity. She kissed me on the cheek without warning, the quick brush of someone who has forgotten certain proprieties in favor of others, and then apologized as if the law forbade affection between co-conspirators.\n\n\u201cI slept for an hour and a half,\u201d she said cheerfully, which is how the bravest people I know tell you they are very, very tired. \u201cJoy\u2019s numbers stayed\u2014\u201d She stopped herself from saying good. Superstition expands to fit any space it\u2019s offered. \u201cThey stayed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour home phone?\u201d I asked, and she nodded, her mouth flattening.\n\n\u201cTapped, or else I\u2019ve learned to be paranoid late. Doesn\u2019t matter. We move anyway,\u201d she said. \u201cI talked to Dr. Carrow at Jackson. She\u2019s got a room. She will not put us on paper until she sees it with her own eyes, and I respect her for that and I hate it because my patience is a thimble, not a bowl.\u201d\n\n\u201cDr. Carrow,\u201d I repeated, liking the shape of the name, the way it sounded like something that carried you. \u201cShe the kind to share credit?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the kind who doesn\u2019t notice credit until she stumbles over it and bruises,\u201d Darla said. \u201cI envy people like that. My envy is not large. It\u2019s a tidy thing.\u201d\n\nWe laughed because we had to. In Joy\u2019s room, light splayed itself on the floor as if wanting to nap. She had a book open face-down on her stomach like a small, sunning animal, and when she woke to see us it was with that unstartled blink only children and monks have mastered. Her scarf today had tiny birds stitched along the edge, each one bent toward the same direction, as if obeying a wind their cloth could remember.\n\n\u201cYou look like trouble,\u201d she told me, and I bowed slightly, because the only compliment I have ever been any good at accepting is that I am likely to make a mess.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re driving to Jackson, not to run away but to be seen,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you think your parents can be convinced to let you nap in a moving car without believing that\u2019s a metaphor for death?\u201d\n\nShe grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who talks about metaphors. They talk about how far it is and whether we have to stop to pee. I have charts in my head. They have distances in miles.\u201d\n\nEarl and his wife arrived with a tote bag that had been a tote for bread at one time\u2014you could tell by the faint scent no laundering could erase\u2014and we loaded the car like we were going to the beach and not to a place where people watch numbers like hawks. Darla got behind the wheel, which surprised me and then did not, because she hates being a passenger whenever the road feels like a sentence you can finish with a good verb.\n\nThe highway between Meridian and Jackson goes past the kind of fields you think are empty until you look and see the low muscles of creatures moving through them. Kudzu tries to take whole trees into its mouth and fails prettily. Pil called once, then again, and I told him to put me on live because if I had time to think I would stop breathing. He introduced me with a song, some throwback soul number that made my ribs loosen, and said, \u201cMeridian, you know this man, and if you don\u2019t, you will, and he will make you mad and he will make you proud, and then you\u2019ll want to feed him casseroles, which he accepts in tinfoil only because he trusts no one to return a Pyrex unchipped.\u201d\n\nIt is possible to love a friend for how well he lies on your behalf. I talked for three minutes with my voice pitched low. I avoided numbers. I told a story about watching my mother fall asleep mid-needle, the thread half-pulled through the fabric, and how when I woke she had gotten up quietly and finished the seam so that in the morning the quilt looked inevitable, and how inevitability is just the name we give to stubborn kindness. The switchboard lit red, Pil later told me, with people who felt either blessed or betrayed by me, and which one you feel has a lot to do with what you ate for breakfast, or how close you\u2019ve been standing to machines that hiss.\n\nIn Jackson, the hospital does not pretend to be anything but what it is: a space where bodies are counted against their wishes. Dr. Carrow had hair the color of a penny left on the sill for exactly one winter and eyes that didn\u2019t scan the way doctors\u2019 eyes sometimes do when they\u2019re collecting you for later. She took Joy\u2019s hand, and the way she held it without squeezing made me want to propose to her on Darla\u2019s behalf. In the lab, the air had that metallic chill that suggests the thermometer is the one person in the room whose taste matters. Carrow walked us past things that hummed and shone with their own certainty.\n\n\u201cMarkers match,\u201d she said, using the flat voice of someone who has learned that good news, spoken with too much warmth, will be punished by a bad god. \u201cWe\u2019ll draw and we\u2019ll start. I\u2019m going to call this an observation. It will not be nothing. You will try to understand that this very careful scene we are acting in is also theater.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is theater,\u201d I said, then winced because I had stolen a line from an undergraduate course I once took and barely passed.\n\nIn the room where they would hang the drug and the not-a-drug, Darla stood in the corner like she was bad at being told to be anywhere but the middle. Joy looked at us and then looked up and said, \u201cWill my hair come back different,\u201d which was not the question any of us expected and all of us cherished.\n\n\u201cIt often does,\u201d Carrow said. \u201cSometimes curlier. Sometimes like it won a small argument about itself. My friend\u2019s came back with a stupid cowlick and she says the cowlick makes her brave because it refuses to obey even when prudence suggests otherwise.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen good,\u201d said Joy, and closed her eyes like a girl folding herself up, then opening on cue.\n\nWe were there for an hour before Meridian decided it could not bear to be only a place in our rearview mirror and called anyway. The board had drafted a letter to the state health department requesting an investigation into \u201cirregularities of care.\u201d They had copied Sloan, who called me not to gloat and not to warn, but to say a sentence without verbs. \u201cThey touched the wrong door,\u201d he said, and I heard the exhausted gladness of a man who has finally decided to put down a heavy object he had been carrying because his father told him it made him taller.\n\n\u201cWhat door?\u201d I asked, not because I didn\u2019t know, but to make him say it aloud.\n\n\u201cOversight,\u201d he said. \u201cYou said it at the forum. They took the word standard and tried to turn it into something sharp. The administrator at the department? She lost her sister at twenty-six because a hospital waited. They have done themselves an injury and I cannot politely point it out, so I am calling you so you will hit it with a hammer.\u201d\n\nI thanked him, and then didn\u2019t, because we\u2019d become the kind of people with a ledger of compliments we owed and we were never going to settle the account in full. Carrow poked her head in, and Darla\u2019s face loosened into a precise joy I have seen on very particular days\u2014weddings that were not mistakes, verdicts that undid a year of someone else\u2019s cruelty, mornings when rain holds off just long enough for a funeral with folding chairs.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d she said, and I did, and there it was: a graph writing a story it had refused to tell all those who came to listen before.\n\nI did not cry because I am bad at crying when other people are brave. I reserve my tears for laundry rooms and for the exact moment I trip over a low shoe I placed in the hallway myself. Earl made a noise like the lowest note on a fat wooden instrument, and his wife pressed both her hands to her scarf with the oranges, then did a little bounce that would have been mistaken for silly in another room but was exactly right in this one. I thought of my mother\u2019s hand on the back of my neck when I slept and woke to find nap marks on my face that she never mentioned except with a smile.\n\nOn the drive back, Meridian looked darker, either because a storm thought about arriving and declined like a guest with an excuse, or because my eyes had grown tired with all the looking. We took the road that skirts a junkyard I have always loved for its honesty. Cars sit there with their mouths open, waiting to be cannibalized, their wires like veins. Somebody had strung a piece of fabric across the chain-link fence, a flag with no nation, and it flapped with the kind of conviction you admire in fools.\n\nThe office smelled faintly of lemon because my secretary, Aimee, cleans her countertop when she is anxious, and the smell lifts through our cheap vents like republics do, unevenly, catching in the pockets and making them lemon-er than their neighbors. There was a box on my chair labeled with my name in a handwriting I did not recognize but felt I ought to. I picked it up the way you pick up a child who does not yet trust you and may kick.\n\nInside lay a teddy bear, not new. The fur was rubbed in patches the way fur gets rubbed when it has done its duty protecting a small person from loud clocks and grown-up laughter. A seam ran along its belly, and the seam had been cut open cleanly\u2014no raggedness, no haste\u2014and then tugged apart, leaving its stuffing slightly visible, a little throat on the wrong part of a body. There was a note tucked so carefully under the arm that I had to admire the hand that placed it even while wishing the hand belonged in a trap.\n\nDo you keep what\u2019s inside inside? it asked, without capitalization, without punctuation, as if those were luxuries we could dispense with now. A lumpy stitch closed the rest of the page, a child\u2019s performance of mending written in thread. I put my fingers into the bear\u2019s belly, then stopped because I am not the man who does that, and then did it anyway because maybe I am. Inside, someone had tucked a single business card. The card smelled faintly of smoke, and the name on it belonged to a warehouse company out by the highway, one that services hospitals, one owned, as it happened, by a McCreedy cousin whose wedding, I remembered, I had once attended in a suit that did not quite fit because Aimee had convinced me the photograph would live forever.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re bold,\u201d Aimee said quietly, having watched my face do what it does. \u201cThey want to be credited for the threat. That\u2019s the part that\u2019s always seemed strangest to me about this place. People sin and then they monogram it.\u201d\n\nShe and I boxed the bear back up, then took it out, then boxed it again. I called Sloan and told him I would be sending a copy of the card to someone who would know what to do with it, and he said to use an envelope without a return address because theatre had to be played in all directions for this one to land. I told him he was becoming exhausting in his good advice and he said, softly, almost laughing, \u201cYou make me brave. I forgot how to be embarrassed when I stopped making music.\u201d\n\nThat afternoon, we had our first home visit request from someone who lived an hour past where the maps give up. The email contained its own accent. It asked us to come look at a man named Buckley who had grown up with so many sisters he never learned to keep his elbows to himself and had recently been taught the limits of bone. The markers, scribbled numerically as if from memory, matched too closely to be coincidence. Darla read the note and then set her jaw and looked at me like an artist finds a subject by accident and must pretend it was an intention all along.\n\n\u201cIf they take my keys, I bring my hands,\u201d she said, and packed a bag like a midwife.\n\nWe drove at dusk, the sky a bruise, the road stitching fields to one another with a line so straight it felt like a dare. Buckley\u2019s house had three chairs on a porch even though there were six residents, which told me a lot about their fights. Inside, the air held a mixture of onions and oil and something sweet. He lay on the couch, not pretending the couch did not shame him by being a couch and not a bed. His sisters were younger, all of them with long hair they obviously took turns combing. Everything in that room had been touched too many times and was not ashamed of it.\n\nHe watched Darla with a distrust so pure it was almost a kind of honesty I wished I could bottle and give to every judge I\u2019d ever stood before. She asked what she should ask, then asked what none of us ever ask because we pretend bodies are the only site of pain. \u201cWho told you you weren\u2019t allowed to be scared,\u201d she said. He cried like a man learning a word in a language he pretended he didn\u2019t want to speak.\n\nI stood in the doorway like furniture. I looked at the curtains, which were made of a fabric I recognized from the chain-store in town that sells everything and nothing at a price that makes you feel complicit. The hem had been taken up with a contrasting thread, a quick job done by a hand that assumed no one would be rude enough to notice. I noticed, and loved whoever had done it for refusing to apologize for haste. We left a cooler with things that will never be cooler enough for anyone who has had to use one to hold medicine. As we drove away, a dog chased the car for the first ten feet and then remembered his other duty, which was to sit on the porch and guard the chairs.\n\nThe letter from the state came the next morning, and I understood immediately what Sloan had meant about the wrong door. It was written in the unadorned tone of people who have been taught, usually by loss, that adornment should be rationed. It asked the board to explain, in writing, why its waiver process required three months even when a physician\u2019s request included language about imminent decline. It asked for dates. It asked for copies of donor agreements in which practices were \u201csuggested,\u201d a word that can mean a lot if you were raised to hear nuance, and can mean nothing if you live in a house where nuance is a cousin nobody invites because he never brings a dish. I took the letter to McCreedy\u2019s office myself, because I wanted to see his face absorb it, and because I am, at heart, childish enough to enjoy a legal delivery that feels like a dessert hurled low across a long table.\n\nThe receptionist, whose nails were a miracle of patience and tiny art, asked if I had an appointment. I smiled and said I had a public document with a private effect. She looked at me the way women look at men who enjoy awakening the appetite of the room for drama, and then buzzed me through. McCreedy stood with his back to the window, a tall man whose suits always fit like a hand-laundered shirt on a child. His hair was the color of money and he used gel the way some men use prayer. He took the letter, smiled to show he knew what was in it, then let the smile slip to show me it could slip when he wanted.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re making a mess, Barry,\u201d he said pleasantly. \u201cThis town likes tidiness. I\u2019m trying to protect your career from your convictions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to protect your convictions from your career,\u201d I said, and he laughed because the line was too good to ignore, even for someone who prefers a dull sentence to a smart blade any day. He tapped the corner of the letter against his desk and then set it down as if the page might bruise. When he looked at me again, I saw the calculation men like him cannot resist. Am I the thing to be bent, he was wondering, or do I carry my own metal.\n\nWhen men decide to harm you in Meridian, they call your mother\u2019s pastor and ask him to pray for you out loud on a Sunday for a thing you did not do. If your mother is dead, they call the pastor anyway, because they prefer their weapons consecrated. The next weekend, a friend sent me a clip from a service in which the pastor called down wisdom on those \u201cwho are lured by the lights of arrogant science and forget to be small,\u201d and while I do not name myself a Christian anymore, I know a parable when I hear one and I know a cudgel when I am struck with it. After church, at the grocery, two women I\u2019d known since grade school turned their heads at the exact same angle so their hair made a curtain and their mouths could work in that quick, righteous way. The aisle with the canned beans has never felt so long.\n\nSloan, who has spent his whole life in rooms where other people pretend not to move the furniture while you are seated on it, called me and did not say I told you so. \u201cI am finding that when I hum while I write a brief, my sentences relax,\u201d he told me instead, as if reporting a symptom. \u201cMy assistant thinks I have lost my mind. The mind that did that work deserved to be lost. I\u2019m beginning a motion with a story. Do you believe me? I am terrified.\u201d\n\n\u201cTerroir makes better arguments,\u201d I said, because I read that somewhere and wanted it to be true about everything.\n\nHe hummed on the line without meaning to, and I pictured his mouth, which had never entertained much softness, shaping around the note. \u201cThey will file a bar complaint,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should know. There is a woman whose business it is to write such things for people who cannot bring themselves to say them aloud. She wrote mine when I prosecuted the wrong boy a lifetime ago, and I will never use her again, because she made me excellent and I hated it. She is on retainer to the warehouse people. I don\u2019t want you surprised.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like being surprised,\u201d I lied, because some lies are less about the truth and more about practicing a posture. He hung up and I put the phone on the kitchen counter and pressed my palms into the laminate until the cheap pattern printed itself on my skin. When I lifted my hands, the pale ovals faded fast, which felt like an omen I chose not to interpret.\n\nJoy texted me a photo of her lab sheet with a single number circled and a row of confetti emojis she would not have deigned to use two months ago. \u201cI feel like I swallowed the right seed,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMaybe it will sprout an ugly flower and I won\u2019t care.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlant anything,\u201d I wrote back. \u201cEven weeds have the decency to try.\u201d\n\nThat night, I dreamt the courthouse steps were made of fabric and each time I took a step my foot sank an inch and a needle poked up from the next rung to tell me, with a sting, to be careful. When I woke, my chest hurt the way it does in the dreams where you run too fast in one direction and realize the floor has tilted. I made coffee that tasted like grief then tried again and made coffee that tasted like medium resolve. The mail came with an envelope that had the weight of a menacing invitation. The bar complaint alleged that I had advised a physician to prescribe outside of protocol for personal gain and had \u201cmarketed claims of miracle\u201d to the detriment of an unnamed population. It cited the radio appearance Pil had insisted on. It cited a sentence from an online article at a site everyone knows and no one admits to reading, which had called me \u201cmercurial and emotional,\u201d both of which are true and neither of which is illegal.\n\nI took the complaint to the one person in town besides me who keeps file folders alphabetized but not color-coded because color-coding, she says, is a religion she refuses to practice. Mrs. Hale has been practicing law since before I could pronounce tort properly, and she smells like cedar and the inside of library books that have been stored well. She read it with her eyebrows lifting at regular intervals and then she put her finger on my name at the top as if to anchor me and said, \u201cThey don\u2019t know how you learned to sew. They think you only learned to rip. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of being fine,\u201d I said. \u201cI want to be loud and right and forgiven.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can pick two,\u201d she said crisply, then softened. \u201cIt feels bigger because it is. It\u2019s bigger because we haven\u2019t done this before and you are arrogant enough to pretend you know how. Thank God for arrogance, sometimes. It keeps us out of trouble and it drags us toward the places trouble turned into a map.\u201d\n\nOn the day of the administrative hearing, Meridian chose humidity as a weapon. The room had a fan but it clicked, and the clerk, out of loyalty to silence, turned it off while we spoke. The panel sat in their chairs as if the chairs were electric and would shock them if they leaned too far in any direction. Sloan stood and, true to his word, began with a story about a boy who hummed while he did his homework and got hit with a ruler because humming has no place in math. He said he had spent his career learning to do the kind of work that makes humming illegal and he was here to ask to reverse a very small law in a very small place.\n\n\u201cWe are not asking to change the way medicine is practiced in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are asking to make room for a thing that is happening while we speak. I have seen the numbers. I have seen the faces behind them. They look like the people who attended my wedding and the people who avoided it. They look like this town.\u201d\n\nThe warehouse men sat in the back, their shirts gleaming absurdly. One of them had a pinky ring that caught the lights whenever he shifted his hand, and I had a childish fantasy of stealing it and dropping it into a glass of water to watch it fizz. Darla spoke next, and she was as precise as I have ever heard anyone be. She used phrases that made the panel blink because their cadence belonged to rooms where people speak quietly so sorrow does not run too fast. She said off-label as if labeling were a superstition and not a comfort. She said adverse event and the room\u2019s very few children, dragged there because their babysitters fell through, turned their faces because they recognize the tone adults use when they want to say death but cannot.\n\nWhen it was my turn, I did not make it about my mother. I wanted to, because my heart is a noisy snob. I spoke instead about the plainest part of the law: its decent wish to give a person not a past but a future. I said the phrase \u201creasonable choice\u201d twice and only knocked my knuckle against the table once, by accident, which counts as progress for a man like me. At the edge of the room, a woman whose sister had been Joy\u2019s nurse for three months started to cry openly, and no one told her to leave, and that felt like we had done one thing right whether or not we won what was on the paper.\n\nWe did not win. Of course we did not. The panel deferred, which is a kind of slap you deliver with a silk glove when you don\u2019t want to bruise the hand but do want to remind it who owns the glove. We filed out into a heat so generous even enemies felt briefly bonded by it. One of the warehouse men brushed past me and said, his voice like candy dropped in a church pew, \u201cWe needed to see if you frighten easy. You do not. That is inconvenient for us.\u201d He smiled and added, almost regretful, \u201cWe will have to be creative. Creativity is not what we pay for.\u201d\n\nThat night Darla called at eleven to say Joy\u2019s temperature had spiked. There are words that cut through a phone line and rearrange the furniture in your chest. Spike is one. I put on shoes without socks and drove too fast and did not apologize to the two yellow lights I made deals with. Joy\u2019s face burned and her eyes were so clear they looked like someone had polished them to sell them in a store. Carrow had sent instructions and a dose and a warning, and we followed all three as if we were learning a dance with music we considered personal. The room smelled like water. Earl stood in the doorway as if the door had hired him to be the respectable face of alarm.\n\nThe fever broke at three the way thin ice breaks under a foot that deserves to be forgiven for the trouble it causes. Her hair plastered to her head and she looked like a girl again and not like a saint, which I prefer because saints are exhausting and girls are what the world is made for. Darla sat on the floor because chairs had become untrustworthy. She rested her head against the cabinet and laughed into her own shoulder, which is the kind of laugh you do when you\u2019re afraid other people will misunderstand happiness if you let it out loose.\n\nWe went outside because the room had been too much a body. The air had that fresh metallic thing again, and I know it is only the smell of wet concrete and the way the night plays tricks but I will call it mercy. Sloan sent a text with a photo of a sheet of music with four measures filled, pencil dark at the edges like he had pressed too hard because the day had asked too much. Underneath, he wrote, \u201cI moved air again,\u201d and I wrote back as carefully as I could, \u201cYou are allowed.\u201d\n\nAs we stood there, a small truck rolled slowly down the street and then slowed more, then stopped. This is a town where stopping is not suspicious until it is. The window rolled down and the man whose teeth were too straight leaned out and said almost sorrowfully, \u201cYou keep choosing the loudest form of your courage. We prefer the quiet kind.\u201d He took a picture of us in the street with a sound that made me think of a zipper, then drove on as gently as he had arrived, and for a second we looked down at our bodies to see if the photograph had removed anything visible.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of their good grammar,\u201d Darla said, and went back inside to watch her patient breathe. I stood there and marveled, the way I have since boyhood, at how very little holds anything where it is, how much of what keeps a town from falling down is the habit of shoes on the same boards and the way we know how to turn a corner without falling apart. My phone buzzed. The state administrator wanted to meet in person in Jackson to talk about a pilot program they might not be allowed to call a pilot program. She\u2019d be on the steps at noon with a folder that looked like any other folder and would contain an invitation she could not hand me without pretending it was a reprimand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring a reprimand folder of my own,\u201d I wrote back, because there are games even I enjoy playing.\n\nI went home and sat in my kitchen and looked at my hands. The crease between thumb and forefinger had a tiny nick in it, right where fast things catch you, and when I flexed my fingers the cut stretched and threatened to split. I sucked on it without thinking, a child\u2019s cure, and tasted faint iron. In the other room, my mother\u2019s quilt hung over the back of a chair, the light catching on the places where her stitches are tighter because my father had left that week and you can see it if you know how to read such things. I ran my fingers over one row and then the next, feeling the bumps like Braille, as if the fabric might tell me what to do next, as if she had hidden directions there, as if the whole world were a garment and somebody had, at last, handed me a needle I knew how to hold.Chapter 5\n\nThe state administrator wore her authority like a linen dress that had seen a careful iron and a careless day. On the steps in Jackson, she stood with a folder so plain it broadcast its own decency, chin lifted not in pride but in habit. Her name was Lorraine Keys, which felt right because you could hear how often she had opened things and how little she had been thanked for it. She extended the folder as if she might be seen on a Baptist postcard doing a similar act with a casserole, and then she smiled in a way that let me know how deeply she had practiced believing polite forms could hold impolite truths until those truths learned to sit up straight.\n\n\u201cMr. Barrett,\u201d she said, and her voice had the grain of someone who had trained it to move through rooms full of men without knocking china. \u201cThis is a reprimand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI adore reprimands,\u201d I said softly. \u201cThey go with all my suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cInside,\u201d she continued, not indulging my bad habit, \u201cyou\u2019ll find a letter asking Saint Rose to clarify its waiver process, a draft schedule for a site visit by my office, and two pages that we\u2019re not supposed to have written yet because they belong to an initiative without a budget or a blessing. We will call it a study for as long as that makes anyone feel safer. Between us, it is a pilot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew I liked you,\u201d I said, and she tilted her head a fraction, fighting the smile that wants to run ahead of a woman\u2019s work and take credit. She pointed to a bench and we sat like strangers about to trade recipes.\n\n\u201cI lost my sister at twenty-six,\u201d Lorraine said plainly, and the sentence walked itself into my body without asking for permission. \u201cThey said there was nothing to be done and then, three years later, there was something to be done and the town that got it first had better handwriting and a man with a lake house. I put a dent in my desk the week I learned that. The dent is still there, and I run my fingers over it when I\u2019m deciding who I\u2019m angry at.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am here to be useful to your anger,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd to your restraint.\u201d\n\nShe nodded. \u201cGood. Because we will need both. I can\u2019t protect you from donors. I can shelter a protocol if we are tidy and if we do not insist the applause precede the work. I will need data that doesn\u2019t look like greed. I will need, especially, a physician who prefers bone-marrow honesty to applause.\u201d\n\n\u201cDarla,\u201d I said. \u201cShe runs on that.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Lorraine said again. \u201cShe will sit on a committee that does not yet exist. You will not. I know your type. Your talent is for throwing open windows and then holding them against a storm. In governance, that makes the papers warp. I mean that kindly.\u201d\n\n\u201cKind is the word I live for,\u201d I said, which is true and feels cheap every time I say it. She tapped the folder and looked out over the parking lot as if it were a plainsong she had memorized and couldn\u2019t stop humming.\n\n\u201cThey will come at supply,\u201d she said without drama. \u201cYou do not need to know how I know. You need only to plan for it. If your town is held together by warehouse men, those men understand that the easiest way to make a doctor behave is to make her wait on a truck. They will not make the drug vanish. They will make the paperwork multiply until you believe it is a forest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know a man who is learning to cut paths,\u201d I said, and thought of Sloan\u2019s mouth shaping notes, his fingers tapping time against his desk. \u201cHe will not like being told where to walk.\u201d\n\nLorraine stood with that briskness women in flats learn so no one thinks their shoes make them slow. \u201cUse the letter. Do not quote me. When they tell you you\u2019re arrogant, try not to prove them right while understanding they will call you arrogant either way. Bring me numbers. Bring me faces only when you must. My staff has very good hearts and poor circulation in their faces; they cannot hear mothers without weeping and it embarrasses them and then they do dumb things with policy.\u201d\n\nShe left with the humility of someone who has learned the cost of being looked at, and I sat on the warm stone and read the reprimand with a hungry pleasure. It was written in the kind of English that believes verbs should be tools: ask, clarify, explain. At the back of the packet, two untitled pages laid out a plain miracle: a registry with teeth, emergency waivers at the department level when boards stalled, and a line reserving a chair for a \u201cpracticing oncologist from an affected community\u201d that had Darla\u2019s shape all over it. I folded the papers small and tucked them where I would not lose them, inside the lining of my jacket in the down-left pocket my tailor had installed because he did not trust me to keep anything precious where it could be reached in a hurry.\n\nOn the drive back, the radio offered a gospel station that bleeds into the frequency Pil uses when storms fret with our towers. A choir lifted a chord so clean I wanted to pull over and iron my day. The tilt of the sun made the magnolia leaves look like coins flipping in the air and coming up the side that feeds you. At a light, a farmer in a truck as old as my regrets glanced over and nodded, and I nodded back with the half-smile men here use when they do not want to be accused of tenderness.\n\nAt Saint Rose, Darla stood in the cruel fluorescent of the lobby like a saint nobody would paint because her hair had escaped its pin and she\u2019d committed the unpardonable sin of existing in relief. She took the folder, scanned the phrases with the flinch of someone half-expecting to find her own name misspelled and her credentials misremembered, then exhaled like a small puncture in a stubborn tire.\n\n\u201cShe did it,\u201d she said, and I felt, for a second, the lovely silly wish to invite Lorraine to supper and cut her a second piece of pie without making a fuss. \u201cThey will call it a reprimand. We will call it anatomy. We need a body to pour this work into.\u201d\n\n\u201cA registry with teeth,\u201d I said, and the phrase tasted satisfying. \u201cYou get a chair. They will pretend to have invented you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can have the credit,\u201d she said, and her mouth insisted it wasn\u2019t a lie and her eyes asked me to remember to argue for her when she forgot she was owed. \u201cJoy\u2019s hair sprouted insultingly early this morning. Two millimeters of bravado along her temple. Earl cried about something on the television and blamed the weather.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me see her,\u201d I said. \u201cI need to recalibrate my face. I\u2019ve been in Jackson where people are paid to control the muscles around their mouths.\u201d\n\nJoy had propped her phone on the tray so she could watch a video of a woman teaching a bird to say something impolite. She waved without pausing the lesson because priorities line up differently when your body has been trying to leave you without your permission. The fuzz along her hairline really was audacious, like a field testifying that green can be a verb even after a fire. Her cheeks had bloomed that dangerous pink that means nothing and everything. When I told her about the registry-that-was-not and the chair-that-was, she nodded like a small mayor.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cMake it so it doesn\u2019t depend on me staying charming.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were never charming,\u201d I said. \u201cYou were honest and people keep mislabeling you because honesty sounds like a joke when you\u2019re used to compliments.\u201d\n\nShe laughed and her mother\u2019s face folded with gratitude so intense it looked like pain. Before I could name that, before I could ruin it by observing it too closely, my phone buzzed with a text from Aimee that did the work of a siren while pretending to be a whisper. The antibiotic had been marked on backorder by both of the large wholesalers who feed our small pharmacies. The reason field read: compliance. The second text contained a photograph of a man at the backdoor of our office holding a clipboard and a smile that had never been a child.\n\nAimee had written only, It begins, and when a secretary who has raised two sons and a business writes a sentence like that without an exclamation mark, you listen like it\u2019s thunder.\n\nThe warehouse men had nudged the river and then complained about the flood. The antibiotic wasn\u2019t special, except now it was. The generic wasn\u2019t common, except now it was rare in the way bread becomes rare in a snowstorm because everyone wants to remember what comfort tastes like. Aimee told the clipboard that any paperwork could be slid under our door because moving our rug was something she refused to perform for men she did not invite. The clipboard\u2019s smile stayed pinned but his eyes did what eyes do when they know the house is not afraid of them.\n\nDarla stood with her hand on the back of Joy\u2019s chair, thumb moving in a small rhythm that told me she was doing math. \u201cThere are animal versions,\u201d she said. \u201cDifferent concentration, same root. I will not poison anyone\u2019s daughter to spite a man\u2019s cousin. But I will make calls to every large animal vet within a hundred miles and I will look them in the soul and ask them what they see when they look back.\u201d\n\n\u201cPil has a cousin,\u201d I said automatically, because in Meridian everything you need is someone\u2019s cousin if you mark your map with enough pushpins. \u201cHe runs a feed store that has the air of a confessional. I\u2019ll talk to him. We will not have you feeding cattle pills to children. We will smooth this bureaucratically while we hunt in fields the board doesn\u2019t know how to plow.\u201d\n\nAs if summoned by audacity, Sloan called. He sounded thinner and stronger, like a wire pulled taut enough to sing. \u201cThey will cut supply,\u201d he said without introduction. \u201cI\u2019ve heard handshakes clicking all morning. Watch your pharmacies. I can\u2019t criminally prosecute a backorder, but I can ask questions in rooms that do not enjoy questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a state folder with a reprimand that asks for sunlight,\u201d I told him. \u201cLorraine sent it. We are to pretend we feel chagrined.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he said, and the word held a note I hadn\u2019t heard from him since we were young men rehearsing our shrugs in different mirrors. \u201cI am filing a public records request for procurement emails at Saint Rose and for any communications including the phrase \u2018alternate source\u2019 or \u2018temporary substitution.\u2019 Their IT will groan. My staff will hate me. My wife will love me for being someone she thought she had to misremember.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause at the back of his breath, and then he said, \u201cI moved on from humming. I wrote something that had the rudeness to be pretty. If you hear someone whistling in the courthouse, pretend you don\u2019t know who it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhistle louder,\u201d I said. \u201cMen in good suits are allergic.\u201d\n\nHe laughed, and it wasn\u2019t the tidy laugh you do when the room expects a noise; it was the kind that steals some of the heat from a day and gives it back when it has cooled it enough to hold.\n\nPil\u2019s cousin, whose name was Boone because of course it was, stood behind a counter piled with salt blocks, dewormer, and things I could not ethically confess to recognizing. He wore a hat that had known good summers and bad fence lines. When I mentioned the drug, he did not tilt his head like someone hearing a new thing. He ran his finger along the shelf tag like a man reading the future in tea leaves and then glanced at me with a frankness that would have ruined a less honest face.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the first to ask,\u201d he said. \u201cLast week Mrs. Ludwig drove down from across the river and bought two bottles after asking me five questions to make me feel like she had read a book about cattle she did not own. I sold her one. I can read a mother, but I can also count inventory. I will not keep a man from curing a calf because men here name their animals and cry when they pretend they don\u2019t. I can get you three bottles if you ask me as if I\u2019m your cousin, and not the way you ask for something illegal that isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking because my cousin is brave,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd because a warehouse man wants to teach us who has hands.\u201d\n\nBoone nodded like I\u2019d finally made a sentence worth hearing. He boxed the bottles with a solemnity that looked like prayer and took my money like it was a story I was letting him borrow. As he slid the package across, he said, \u201cTell your doctor that if she wants to sleep, she\u2019ll have to do it in the afternoon. Nights have gone sticky with people who want to be fixed while other people sleep.\u201d\n\nI left the feed store holding a cardboard cube that seemed to vibrate with metaphor if not with chemistry. It was not our solution. It was our insult to scarcity. Aimee texted me a photograph of the clipboard man sitting in his car with the kind of patience men practice when they believe their waiting is the waiting that counts. She had drawn horns on him with the notes app pen and sent a second text that said simply, lunch? I wrote back that I would bring her a sandwich that would make her consider forgiving me for becoming a crusader without asking her to buy more paper.\n\nBy late afternoon, the hospital smelled like the inside of a freezer-case because the air had decided to snap, and our blood was still on the soft setting. The board sent a memo telling staff to \u201cexpect a routine disruption\u201d as part of the site visit, which is a sentence only people with wood-paneled offices write and only people without keys to any room will be asked to believe. Darla read it in the hallway, crumpled it without grace, then smoothed it with the heel of her hand because a woman who has spent her life coaxing tissues to behave does not throw paper away unpressed.\n\n\u201cLet them disrupt in public,\u201d she said. \u201cI am tired of being scolded behind glass.\u201d\n\nJoy wanted the river. It was a good request masquerading as a bad idea. We loaded her gently into Earl\u2019s truck with the reverence men give things they are not trained to hold. The air near the water was thick with a humming that wasn\u2019t mechanical. The current did its quiet arithmetic, shouldering what the town handed it. Joy sat on the bank with her shoes off, toes in the mud like a small pagan, head tilted back to bite the light. She looked less like a patient than like a girl whose body had just learned summer again.\n\n\u201cDo you think the fish know anything about us,\u201d she asked without turning, \u201cor are we the kind of animals they tolerate the way we tolerate lightning?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are a rumor to fish,\u201d I said. \u201cBut a loud one.\u201d\n\nShe wiggled her toes and grinned. \u201cGood. I am tired of being a lesson. I would rather be noise.\u201d\n\nBehind us, someone played a violin on a porch. At first, I thought it was a radio, because the notes landed too assured for a man in Meridian on a Tuesday, and then I saw Oakes in the doorway of a little rental with a slumping roof. He had kept the violin as I\u2019d told him to, and the way his jaw set said he had paid for that choice with something domestic and complicated. The tune was old enough to belong to nobody, and young enough to make my chest feel like it had been laced tighter than style or propriety required. It wasn\u2019t quite sad. It was the sound a seam makes when it holds under strain.\n\nOakes waved with his bow and then went back to the work of making air behave. Across the road, a sheriff\u2019s cruiser idled in the shade as if it had been assigned to watch the water for crimes it did not wish to find. The deputy lifted his fingers in that universal gesture of a man who has seen too much and still wants to be seen as decent. The warehouse men did not appear, but the fact of them sat on the grass like a hat nobody admitted to owning.\n\nWe did not stay past dusk because the mosquitoes here are thorough and prefer the ankles of the idealistic. Back in town, I found a note taped to my door written in the florid hand of someone proud of their penmanship and uninterested in its uses. It did not threaten so much as curate: a list of names, each with a year beside it, men and women who had filed for bankruptcy after crossing the McCreedy cousins on matters of distribution. At the bottom, in tiny letters like an afterthought sewn into a hem, the question again: do you keep what\u2019s inside inside. I understood, not for the first time, that I was being addressed by someone who had misunderstood sewing as surgery.\n\nI took the list to Mrs. Hale, who was in her office stapling something with a vigor that suggested she believed she could attach the world to itself and keep it from fraying. She read it, lifted one eyebrow as if speaking privately to it, and slid it into a sleeve in a binder that would be labeled something like Antagonists: Accomplishments which is a system I respect more every time I see her use it.\n\n\u201cThey will exhaust you,\u201d she said, and poured me tea that tasted like someone had put lemon across the threshold and then asked it to wait outside. \u201cWin quick where you can. Lose with elegance where you must. Don\u2019t snarl unless you are willing to bite. And for the love of all that is holy, do not trip over your own cape.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would need to own a cape,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m still at the scarf stage.\u201d\n\n\u201cMen in scarves,\u201d she said drily, \u201care a menace if they don\u2019t understand their necks are vulnerable. Your client with the violin sent me a note. He wants a new will. He has fallen in love with a woman who sells perfume and refuses to borrow money from him, and he says this has rearranged his sense of justice. Tell him to come in Wednesday. I like women who refuse.\u201d\n\nThe next morning began with a thud that resolved into a letterbox chewing up something thick. The bar had docketed the complaint. It had a hearing date that suggested the clerk who chose it enjoyed planting events where they could ruin your favorite lunch. Aimee read the notice, then walked to my office and closed the door like she was making a room in which I might be allowed to be less brave.\n\n\u201cYou need to sleep in this chair with your jacket on and your shoes off for thirty minutes,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you do not, you will make a mistake on paper that will make me embarrassed to call your mother a good woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like your priorities,\u201d I said, and set my phone on the desk face down like a sinner laying down a weapon. She turned off the light and left the door cracked the way you do for a child, and I slept for twenty-two minutes and woke with a damp line where my face had made claims on the upholstery. In the dim, the office looked both foreign and delighted to have me vulnerable. I sat up slower than my day wanted and poured coffee with that trembling care you learn when you\u2019ve spilled too much lately.\n\nSloan beat me to the courthouse. When I arrived, he was steps from the rotunda, shirt sleeves rolled, tie loosened in a concession to the weather and to his sudden insistence that performances can be better for refusing some of their costumes. He held a sheaf of papers that looked like all the others and were not. At the top, in a font the secretaries favor because it suggests decency without announcing taste, the words Motion for Protective Order: Supply Interference sat with a calm that made me love my language again.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll say I\u2019m inventing a cause,\u201d he said, before I could praise him. \u201cI\u2019m not. I am stitching two causes together where they should have been introduced years ago. Restraint of trade does not become virtuous because a donor likes the company Christmas party.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hummed when you wrote that title,\u201d I said, and he looked down like a boy caught putting jam on the good knife.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I kept my job through lunch.\u201d\n\nThe hearing room smelled like dry books and men who decline water because they fear its softness. The judge wore his robe like a thin apology and his expression like a compromise with regret. Sloan spoke with that new slight lean he\u2019d found, the one that said he had discovered he had a body and it could carry him without cruelty. He did not mention Joy by name. He did not say cancer. He spoke about scarcity erected on purpose, about the difference between delay that saves life and delay that buys yachts. He used a word I hadn\u2019t heard him use before in a court: mercy.\n\n\u201cBoth sides like to argue as if we are in separate shops,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cAs if the law sells only tools and medicine sells only cures. We do not. We both sell time. Today I am asking you to sell it to the people with the least, rather than to the people with the most. It will sting someone. It always does.\u201d\n\nMcCreedy\u2019s lawyer, who had a talent for leaving no footprint on a rug, stood and said the phrase \u201coverreach\u201d with the unctuous authority of a man who has never reached for anything that wasn\u2019t handed to him. He smiled toward me like a man offering a seat on a boat he planned to sink when we got out a little ways. The judge listened with his head tilted, that foxlike posture you develop when you are being asked to bless something you know you\u2019ll meet again in a different robe. He took the motion and did not grant it. He took the motion and did not deny it. He did something I love him forever for and resent him the next hour over: he asked for an evidentiary hearing with affidavits from any pharmacist willing to write the sentence \u201cI was told to delay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis will make someone lose a job,\u201d Sloan said after, in the hallway that remembers every whisper. \u201cI am done being the man who arranges for the wrong people to lose jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will come for yours,\u201d I said. \u201cThey already have their pencils out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI bought a new one for myself,\u201d he said, and when I looked at his hand I saw he had a blister where his music had been practicing being heavier than the law.\n\nBy dinner, Pil had wrangled me onto the radio again because he believes in repetition the way grandmothers believe in butter. We talked around the supply, we talked toward the hearing, we did not say the word boycott, we said the phrase quiet harm, and the phones did their red show. A woman confessed that she had been told, once, to wait for a scan until the fiscal quarter turned over. A man admitted he had swapped labels in a stockroom because the only power he\u2019d been given was his handwriting and he had decided it could save a life. Neither hung up on time because people who have been carrying their stories need a runway long enough to lift them.\n\nSometime after nine, while I was still at the office pretending to tidy the stack of papers that had adopted me, the building breathed differently. The old hat store has a way of telling you when someone has opened its door even if that someone is trying to muscle their way into invisibility. A floorboard to the left of the stair creaked, not the friendly sound of Aimee\u2019s heels but the reluctant sound of a man in soft soles. I stood and did not reach for anything heavier than my own spine.\n\n\u201cYou can come in,\u201d I said, and the man with the straight teeth entered like a neighbor with a pie, only there was no dish and his hands were empty as a sermon that has decided to be cruel. He did not sit. He inspected my suit with his eyes and I let him, which is a small power, allowing someone to measure you by their own tape.\n\n\u201cWe prefer back channels,\u201d he said, patient as a parent with a child picking at a scab. \u201cYou have made us noisy. Noisy costs money. Do you know how many trucks we turn around when the radio makes the town think it deserves to perform its own medicine?\u201d\n\n\u201cFewer than you did last week, if the state has anything to say,\u201d I said. \u201cWhich it does. Nicely. With a folder.\u201d\n\nHe paced my office without shoes squeaking because men like him buy soles that have remembered how to behave. He looked at my bookshelf, the cheap law books dressed up by my vanity with two hardcovers that had dust jackets I hadn\u2019t removed because I married the phrase first edition once and never wanted to divorce it.\n\n\u201cWe can be friends,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not a threat. It is a promise. We can find a way to make your doctor\u2019s experiment live inside a carton we control. You like control. Lawyers pretend they don\u2019t and then you see them count their pens.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will not own this,\u201d I said. \u201cThere are things this town doesn\u2019t get to own anymore. Grief. Air. The protocols for mercy.\u201d\n\nHe stood still then, like someone had whispered a note he\u2019d been trying to find on an instrument he never learned. For a second, I saw the child he probably had been, the one who lined his toy cars in ranks not to be cruel but to impose order on a day that had no parent in it. Then his face shuttered like a window people are too gentle to slam.\n\n\u201cOrder keeps people from dying,\u201d he said. \u201cChaos kills. Your project is chaos in Sunday clothes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOrder without ethics is ash in a box you convince yourself is a church,\u201d I said, and he smiled like a teacher generously awarding me a B-plus.\n\n\u201cI will take your metaphor to lunch,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will lose your license. I will not. Both things will be regrettable. We will both survive.\u201d\n\nHe left without taking my air, which I count as a victory. I sat down and realized my hands had been clenched in my lap in a way my mother would have scolded me for at supper. I thought of Sloan\u2019s blister, of Darla\u2019s thumb tracing quiet circles on the back of a chair, of Lorraine\u2019s folder tucked like a heart into my jacket. I thought of Joy holding water with her feet, asking the river to remember her. Somewhere in town, Oakes was playing the last notes of a thing that had no name and that did not need one, and the warehouse men were doing math and the state was building a file cabinet for a kind of mercy that had never had its own drawer.\n\nJust before midnight, when the town does its loudest pretending at being quiet, my phone lit with a text from an unknown number and the words that can unmake a day or fortify it. I have receipts, it said. The photograph that followed was of an invoice from a month ago for a pallet of the very antibiotic we were begging for, marked paid by a shell company whose mailing address belonged to a church\u2019s dead P.O. box. The signature at the bottom had been obscured with one of those clumsy black bars people use when they think they\u2019ve learned the law from a television show. If you brightened the image, the bar went transparent at the edges and a little curve of an M showed through, the way thread does if you lift the seam to the light.\n\nBring coffee, the second text read. And a needle. I like men who can mend.Chapter 6\n\nThe text had that briskness people use when they\u2019ve made a decision and they\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll unmake it if anyone speaks too long. I answered with a time and the address of the church on Pecan, the one with the brick face that looks too steady for the century that made it. The fellowship hall smells like coffee and card tables and floor wax that remembers being stronger. It is the only place in Meridian where secrets and casseroles are set next to each other without commentary. I packed two large cups from E.J.\u2019s, the lids trembling like they didn\u2019t like the heat they\u2019d agreed to carry. Then I took my mother\u2019s needle tin down from the top shelf, the shallow metal one with strawberries on the lid and a scuff where a life once dragged across it. The heft of it in my hand steadied me. It\u2019s a ridiculous thing, to be calmed by a tin that rattles when you walk, but almost everything good in my life is ridiculous.\n\nI arrived five minutes early because I refuse to make church ladies wait, even if I wasn\u2019t certain my informant was one. The quilting circle had convened itself at the long tables, a loose congress of women who could run a legislature if asked and who have chosen, instead, to govern thread. Their hands moved while their mouths did, and if you\u2019ve never seen a needle pierce a quilt in time with a story, you have not understood what choreography is. Miss Laverne, who looks like she smells of starch even when she doesn\u2019t, lifted her chin toward a far table as if to say, Your witness is there, and also, do not drip coffee on the binding, I remember you as a child.\n\nShe sat apart with a posture that had practiced being unobtrusive and then decided, today, it would rather be noticed in the right way. She wore a dress in a faded flower, the kind that looks like it knows more seasons than your spine. Her hair was back with a clip you could buy for a dollar and then keep for twenty years. On the table in front of her lay a banner for a church homecoming, white satin with gold letters, the gold only a little gaudy, because even Methodists understand a festival requires a small sin. She did not extend her hand. She tapped two fingers on the banner hem and nodded once at the coffee.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Elise,\u201d she said, and the name landed with a small weight I didn\u2019t question. \u201cI\u2019m the one who checks the church P.O. box because Pastor Ray is too busy pretending mail is beneath him. This box has held Christmas letters, tithes from men who only like God at Easter, and every manner of passive-aggressive note a woman can send to another woman about committee work. Then it held invoices. Then it held checks.\u201d\n\nI slid the coffee toward her, careful of the satin, careful of the way she had positioned herself one step out of any safe light. She took a sip like a person who does not trust pleasure and then set the cup down with a sigh that said she remembered how it can save you.\n\n\u201cThey like to name their companies decent,\u201d she said, eyes on the hem. \u201cThis one is called Auxiliary Logistics. Auxiliary like helpful and logistics like they have a map. The return address is our old P.O. box with a new number written like a lie over an old truth. Their checks came from a foundation with a cross printed in the corner. I keep records because I was not allowed to go to college and I have been storing my learning in tidy marks and good paper ever since.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have receipts,\u201d I said, and she smiled without warmth, pleased I had not made her repeat herself.\n\n\u201cI have more than receipts,\u201d she said. \u201cI have their paper, and I have the shape of them. I have the right to be tired, and I have a friend at the pharmacy who tells me when the trucks are \u2018delayed\u2019 in a tone that means \u2018not delayed.\u2019 I have sent my nephew to take pictures of pallets in a storage unit with a lock that thinks it is admired. I have tucked a copy of all of it where church men won\u2019t look, because they do not believe in hems.\u201d\n\nShe pushed the banner toward me until the gold C of Christ wobbled and the satin whispered. I opened my mother\u2019s tin and the old smell of metal and talc and something like time lifted out. The needle felt right between my fingers. The hall went quiet in that way rooms do when something more interesting than complaint arrives. I slid the point under the seam and teased. Satin resists politely and then relinquishes. I pulled the hem three inches and my breath slowed the way it does when a lock gives to your key.\n\nFrom inside the false fold, she drew a sleeve, thin plastic, the kind you store photographs in when you promise yourself you will put them into an album and never do. Within, copies, thirty at least, of invoices and emails, some printed with that pale toner that says the printer hates the work it is doing. Names floated where they should not, not just the shell\u2019s, not just the cousin\u2019s, but a procurement manager at Saint Rose, two donor liaisons whose smiles have paid a mortgage, and one familiar curving M that completed itself when Elise held the page to the light just so.\n\n\u201cThey will burn me for this if they can,\u201d she said without ceremony. \u201cThey will call me jealous or silly or bitter or insane, and they will be correct at least once in their adjectives. I prefer brave. I prefer seamstress. I prefer citizen. I prefer woman who has had enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are all of those,\u201d I said, and I said it low because compliments sound truer when they are not performing into a microphone. \u201cWhat do you need from me besides coffee and a needle?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you to carry this like the thing it is,\u201d she said. \u201cI need you to turn it into a file a man can\u2019t pretend not to see. I need you to give it to someone with a hammer and then stand still while it hits and not flinch because you remember what flinching costs. I need you to keep my name out of the first story and, when it can be in safely, to put it there lovingly. I need you not to forget me if they ask you to.\u201d\n\nI promised the only way I know how, with my face. I tucked the sleeve into my brief bag the way you tuck a child into a coat that you do not trust to be warm enough. I resewed the banner with twice as many stitches as I had undone, because a seam like that deserves a redundancy and because women with scissors watched me and I did not intend to be rude.\n\n\u201cWill you stay and take a brownie you don\u2019t deserve,\u201d Miss Laverne called, which is how in Meridian you say you will be protected by something larger than you and it will not make the papers. Elise did not meet my eyes again. She ran her finger along the new seam, nodded once at the workmanship, and returned to stitching gold letters as if letters were any protection.\n\nOn the steps outside, the heat did its hawk impression. Sloan arrived at the same time as if summoned by a bell I had not heard. He had loosened his tie to the point that he might as well have taken it off, and his shirt sleeves looked like the part of a man that has been practicing confession. I lifted the sleeve of copies in my bag a fraction, and he inhaled like a doctor who has seen the color you hope for on a wound.\n\n\u201cChain of custody,\u201d he said, and for once the phrase sounded lovely. \u201cWe will do this like a lab. We will sign across tape. We will number pages. We will ask Elise\u2014I assume that is her name\u2014to write two paragraphs in her own hand and to tuck them in a Bible only she will touch, and we will not take them out until the judge asks us to, and we will hand him the book with respect.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe likes brave better than chain,\u201d I said, \u201cbut she\u2019ll do both.\u201d\n\nHe asked nothing more until we were back at my office, because he understands that some stories must be allowed to ride in the backseat with the window open. Aimee had cleared her desk with that efficiency that pretends the top sheet was always supposed to be the top sheet. She produced labels with the gravity of a pharmacist. She produced a roll of red evidence tape from a drawer where she keeps things she hopes never to need. We numbered pages in a silence that dignified the mess. We signed across seams. We set the sleeve in a box we had not previously designated sacred and then did.\n\nLorraine answered my call on the first ring, which made me love her more than I had permission to. I told her what we had and she did not exclaim. She asked me to photograph one page that did not matter and to read aloud, slowly, the dates on three that did. She said the words \u201cpublic interest\u201d the way farmers say rain and the way mothers say enough. She gave us the name of a man in the attorney general\u2019s office who cannot keep a secret and a woman in procurement who can. Then she said, \u201cBless the woman who hid that in a hem,\u201d and hung up like her hands were already occupied with other mercies.\n\nWhen we went to see Elise with a simple witness statement on letterhead that meant nothing and would mean everything, she had already put on her cardigan like armor. She wrote in a careful hand that one of the quilting ladies murmured over because it was pretty, and women are allowed to say, even at the edge of trouble, that a thing is pretty. She did not read what she wrote aloud. She slid it into the endpaper of a red Bible with a zipper, the kind campers use, and I laughed because God likes a man who appreciates a zipper. She handed the Bible to me under one condition, which she said out loud so it would stick to the walls.\n\n\u201cYou will give it back to the church after,\u201d she said, and I did not say after what.\n\nThe evidentiary hearing came hard and quick because Sloan had phrased his motion like something a decent man would want to hear while he still had a throat for questions. The courtroom filled with the usual: men in shirts that believe in starch, women with their dignity pinned where it was visible, a few kids whose teachers had called in a favor to turn law into civics for an hour. The warehouse men arranged themselves in the back like an upholstery sample of confidence. McCreedy\u2019s lawyer wore a suit so correct it looked like it had voted already.\n\nSloan did the preliminaries with less theater than I like and more courage than I used to believe he owned. He marked the box, he called the thing a set of records, he asked the judge to mark the sleeve as an exhibit with a number that would look solemn on paper. He took the Bible from my hands with a look that took the measure of my religion and decided it did not matter. He unzipped and slid the two paragraphs out as if he were drawing breath. He did not look up as he read. When he reached the sentence where Elise had written, \u201cI recognized the handwriting because I have been receiving church checks in that hand for eighteen years,\u201d I saw the judge exhale and not want anyone to notice.\n\nMcCreedy\u2019s lawyer asked questions that resize a person until they fit into the story he needs. He wondered whether Elise\u2019s motives were pure, as if there were a test for that at the pharmacy next to the blood pressure cuff. He wondered whether she resented men who count money. He wondered whether she understood the term shell in the non-beach context. She did not answer from the stand because she was not on it. Her words answered in their good dress, and the hearing became a place where a woman\u2019s neat script could make a man summarize himself.\n\nThe pharmacists came in whispered and left with their mouths braver. One man with a name badge that had lost its backing tape testified that he had been told to wait on a shipment because of \u201ccompliance,\u201d and when asked to define compliance, he looked at the warehouse men and said, \u201cBeing obedient to the wrong person.\u201d A woman with hair the color of a good sweet potato admitted she had altered a date field because she had been told to by someone who could not spell her name right. None of this was perfect. All of it was real.\n\nOutside after, the air had the iron of a coming storm, or else we were all tasting the same fear in our mouths and mistaking it for weather. Sloan leaned against the wall not to look casual but because body and wall had finally stopped arguing. He had a smudge of red ink on his thumb where the tape had kissed him. He glanced down at it the way a man glances at proof of a game he had not intended to play and then nodded like he would, in fact, play it again.\n\n\u201cThey will wiggle,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will return a few cases to the pharmacies. They will blame a clerk. They will send their cousins to church. They will deny the shell is theirs. They will call Auxiliary an unfortunate coincidence and Logistics a misunderstanding of gratitude.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will send more bears with their bellies cut,\u201d I said, and he laughed without warmth this time, and then warmth arrived two beats late like a person running for the bus.\n\nHe went home to a child who was still small enough to climb onto knees and a piano small enough to sound like a toy even when someone serious touched it. Darla went back to do rounds without a badge, a woman who had taught herself a new way to carry what she wasn\u2019t allowed to show. I went to Aimee\u2019s desk because she had that look like she had spare courage in her drawer and was ready to loan it out. She gave me a sandwich, because she is a prophet of what you can accomplish when your blood sugar is not a pathetic idea, and then she brought me a stack of envelopes without return addresses because she has been paying attention.\n\nThe warehouse men weren\u2019t idle while we played our pretty little legal music. Boone called to say a man had come by the feed store making conversation about the spring calves and had looked at the shelves with math eyes. The hospital sent a memo about pharmacy substitutions written in a tone administrators use when they want to sound like they care about your diet. Someone unscrewed the porch light at Elise\u2019s house and then screwed it back in badly so it would flicker and make her think her power was sick. She put on her cardigan and fixed the bulb and texted me a picture of the screwdriver with the caption, I can mend my own light.\n\nJoy\u2019s numbers, because the universe likes us better when we think we deserve it, continued to behave. Her phone began to fill with things she wanted to remember later, and I have never been so honored to be sent such incompetently framed pictures. One was of her own forehead in a mirror, the fuzz reaching like a little joke that had decided to live. In the corner, taped to the glass, she had stuck a list that made my throat do something I associate with the last three minutes of a movie you didn\u2019t think could earn your tears. It said: Ferris wheel at dusk, teach Earl to eat sushi, touch the river in winter, write a letter to the girl I was when I was twelve and put it in the freezer to make it last, learn a song without words.\n\nOakes stopped by with a bottle of terrible wine and a face that felt like it had just learned to be handsome. He had not sold the violin. He had met the woman with the perfume and she refused his offer of a check and accepted his offer of a walk around the block, which is how you know you are not a fool and have been for long enough that the universe owes you a little mercy. He played in my office while I pretended to sign something, because sometimes pretending you are at work is a better prayer than the ones we make on Sundays.\n\nThe bar complaint sat like a visitor who does not know how to excuse themselves gracefully. Mrs. Hale and I practiced what I would say. She told me to keep my adjectives folded small and my nouns lined up in their pews. She told me to press the temptation to grandstand like a wrinkle into a shirt with a hot iron and to pretend it was never there. She allowed me two metaphors and one memory, and took a yellow pencil and scored a line through the part of my draft that started with my mother and ended with grief, which felt like being corrected by a line of women in the quilts, and it was right.\n\nIn the middle of all this, Sloan sent me a recording late at night that he did not introduce. It was a minute and a half of a melody that felt like a walk around our block where someone has straightened their porch chairs and swept their step. It was stubbornly pretty, the way some men are pretty despite themselves, and it did the thing music sometimes does where it hangs a picture in your chest you didn\u2019t give it permission to mount. I played it twice. On the third, I realized I was crying in the stupid ugly way that makes your jaw ache, and because I am trying to become the sort of person who tells the truth out loud in rooms where it will be used properly, I texted him, It made me hold my breath in the right way. He wrote back a single word and it wasn\u2019t sorry. It was thanks.\n\nThe judge set the second hearing for a date that sat like a thumb in the middle of our week. Sloan would ask for the protective order again, this time with the red-taped sleeve and the pharmacists\u2019 affidavits and the red Bible we would hand over with reverence, not because it was the law but because it belonged to a woman who had fixed her own lightbulb at midnight. Lorraine promised a person with a clipboard and a skeptical face at Saint Rose by Tuesday, and I told Darla I would bring her a dress with a good pocket and she told me to bring her instead a pen that doesn\u2019t run and a thermos of soup.\n\n\u201cI dreamed last night I was stitching a vein,\u201d Darla said in the corridor, voice barely above polite. \u201cIt was not violent. It was tidy. The body held still for me and the thread behaved and when I woke I understood I do not want to be praised for being brave anymore. I want to be paid in a sleep that does not take my pulse.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building you a registry with a chair,\u201d I said, like a man advertising a porch. \u201cWe cannot promise sleep. We can promise a place to sit.\u201d\n\nWe walked together down the too-bright hall and nodded at a nurse whose hair had learned to make its own rules. The supply closet door was open a precise three inches, as if to announce absence. A foil package had been ripped too neatly to be accident and thrown away badly to be innocence. We have both learned how to read crime in the casual. Darla picked it up and smoothed it on her knee. Her fingers lingered on the edge where the serrations had been asked to do more than they were designed for. She slipped it into her pocket without ceremony, because sometimes the chain of custody begins with a woman who would rather heal than be tidy.\n\nThe site visit began in a conference room with lemon and mint in the water like Lorraine had predicted. A woman with a badge from the department sat with her shoulders arranged like a jazz rhythm and asked questions so clean they sounded like kindness. The board tried on their faces for responsibility and found that the fit did not flatter them. McCreedy called the Auxiliary a \u201ctemporary philanthropic vehicle,\u201d and the woman with the badge wrote down those words like they were obliging little cattle she might lead into a pen later. Sloan did not attend because he understands better than I do when you need a man in a hallway and not at a table. I stayed because I wanted to see the expressions men make when the compliments they practiced for years fall to the carpet like paper you thought would behave.\n\nAt a break, the warehouse man with the good teeth approached me with a smile so clean it squeaked. He asked if I had enjoyed my sandwich and I told him the bread had been dry and the mustard cheap. He told me he admired my persistence and I told him I admired his wardrobe because it served the story he had chosen. He asked what story that was and I said the one where you tell yourself you are the kind of man who can stand in a room with dying people and argue for margins and not look down when your hands tremble. He looked down, and then he looked back up and said, \u201cWe can do high-minded all day, Barrett, but the numbers will ask for blood eventually.\u201d I said, \u201cLet\u2019s give them ours.\u201d\n\nWhen I returned to the office, Aimee had put the sleeve in a box with a red thread tied around it because that is the sort of practical poetry she is capable of when she has eaten. She had also placed a small card on my desk with Elise\u2019s name written in her best cursive and a phone number in a hand that looked like it had been taught by a teacher with a switch. Underneath, in Aimee\u2019s print, were the words: She came by. Brought a pie. Told me to tell you the stitch held. P.S. It\u2019s a chess pie. You like it better than you admit.\n\nThat night, because I am not quite the man I was, I took my mother\u2019s quilt off the back of the chair and spread it over my bed. The room altered. It is a foolish thing to claim a blanket rearranges your lungs, but this one did, because quilts, like good filings and bad arguments, have a way of encouraging your body to remember its shape. My phone lit once on the nightstand and I let it. The city hummed its thin summer song. Down on Pecan, in the fellowship hall, women stitched and told the stories women tell when they do not intend any man to hear them, and a banner with a mended hem waited for a Sunday when it could boast without shame. Somewhere, a deputy flicked his cruiser lights for no reason except the human wish to light yourself up to prove you have some say in the dark.\n\nIn the morning, we would take the red-tied box and the red Bible and the affidavits to the courthouse and set them on the table where men with pens could not pretend they were not heavy. Lorraine would send an email with six words that could change a weather pattern and we would respond with sixteen that might hold. The pharmacy would receive a truck with a driver who had been told to pretend he got lost and he would not get lost. Joy would wake with her hair the exact right length to be mistaken for a choice. Sloan would whistle in the stairwell and forget, for an entire flight, that he was whistling. And I would put my hand on my chest where the small, stupid ache lives and feel it, like a seam you check not because you think it will fail but because you have learned that checking is a way to love the garment more.Chapter 8\n\nThe morning of the second hearing, Meridian chose a light that made every paint chip look recent and every bruise more honest. A wind out of nowhere practiced its way down the courthouse lane and sent the magnolia petals spinning like pale coins too large to spend. I ironed a shirt that had never deserved an iron and told myself I was smoothing stubbornness into cotton, which is the kind of lie a man tells when he needs his sleeves to remember a better posture. Aimee pressed a thermos into my hand at the door and a packet of crackers into my pocket like I was being sent to first grade behind on my letters and ahead on appetite. Pil texted a blessing he\u2019d stolen from a gospel song and signed it with a lightning bolt he pretends is a joke. On the steps, Sloan stood without his tie and with the new angle to his stance that said he had conceded his shoulders were for more than announcing his rank. He did not hum. He breathed like a man who had once monitored his breath for other men and had decided to keep it private until he needed the room to hear him.\n\nInside, the courtroom had the cold of a place that tries to keep feelings under glass. The judge\u2019s clerk shuffled paper like a percussionist tasked with keeping time for a march that did not suit him. McCreedy\u2019s lawyer sat with his portfolio open like a mouth lined with expensive teeth. The warehouse men arranged themselves behind him in that neat ridge a certain species of confidence leaves wherever it sleeps. Darla slid into a pew as if church had finally agreed to count her among the congregation. Lorraine wasn\u2019t there, but her folder might as well have been; I felt its plain gravity at my back like a hand.\n\nSloan called it up like something you pull from a well and take time to admire for the sheen it managed to save. He laid our red-taped box on the evidence table with the square, deliberate tenderness of a man setting down a child after a long walk. The pharmacists\u2019 affidavits went behind it, a fan of paper that held names we\u2019d gotten good at saying in quiet rooms. He didn\u2019t raise his voice. He didn\u2019t point. He spoke about interference without law, a little like pneumonia without fever\u2014the kind that hides until a person learns to listen to their own breath the way they learned to pretend not to. He used that word again, the one he had risked last time. Mercy. He said it without italics, which made it heavier.\n\nMcCreedy\u2019s man did his professional frown and worried at the thread of intent like a cat that believes rugs were invented for it. He called the invoices unfortunate and the shell \u201cmerely an administrative convenience\u201d and, for a wild moment, looked regretful, as if the phrase had cut his gums. The judge listened in that foxed way old men have when they understand a thing is true and are deciding if it is safe to admit it in public. He asked where the missing pallets had gone. He asked what policy had been invoked when the word compliance was put to work as a bouncer outside a door where patients waited in their good clothes with their hats in their hands. And then he did the thing we had been afraid to want him to do: he granted the order.\n\nHe didn\u2019t grant us the cathedral some of us wanted. He gave us a steady chapel with a door that locked. Temporary. Narrow. Immediate. No vendor could withhold the antibiotic or its equivalents from any licensed pharmacy in the county absent an actual, documentable shortage or a federal recall. No substitution could be made for a hospital formulary item already in use without a patient-specific sign-off by a treating physician. All communications regarding acquisition of the relevant drugs were to be preserved and produced on seven days\u2019 notice upon request of the department or the court. He read the words like nails. They went in straight. They made that nice sound when the last tap brings the head flush to the wood.\n\nSomething like breath moved through the room, and for once it wasn\u2019t a hymn. The warehouse men didn\u2019t flinch. They don\u2019t. It isn\u2019t how they were taught to make their faces. But one of them touched his cuff with two fingers as if remembering, too late, that fabric frays where it\u2019s used most often. McCreedy stared as if we had sold him a dog and then told him it was a wolf. Darla closed her eyes and opened them and reached up to push a lock of hair behind her ear that had dared to escape and then let it fall where it wanted to, which is the kind of small rebellion you learn when your larger ones have been priced. Sloan said nothing. He took his copy of the order, folded it once, then placed it flat again like he hadn\u2019t trusted his first instinct with paper in a long time and was beginning to.\n\nOut on the steps, the heat had returned to its post like a guard who had taken a short, guilty nap. People touched my sleeve more than I am comfortable with, which is to say at all, and said my name in ways that made me wish I had been less available to names. A man I did not know put his hand on Sloan\u2019s shoulder and squeezed once and left behind on the cotton a small wet mark his palm had made, and Sloan\u2014who would once have looked down at that like a stain\u2014let it sink in. Pil appeared from nowhere with a microphone he had no business having anywhere near a courtroom and asked me for a sentence that would fit between two weather reports, and I gave him \u201cNo one gets to lock the pantry when the house is on fire,\u201d which is truly a ridiculous sentence but will play well at noon.\n\nThe order did what orders do. It behaved like a sudden stop sign on a road people had driven too fast down for years. There were near-collisions. There was cussing. There were some who slowed and looked around like men surprised to find the neighborhood had always been there and had gotten prettier while they drove with their heads down. A truck that had been circling turned its nose toward a pharmacy that had run out and, in a great show of compliance as performance, backed up too slowly to prove it had patience. We didn\u2019t clap. We watched. Elise texted me a picture of the porch light glowing steady and a second of her hand with a line of red where she\u2019d pricked herself on a pin. She had wrapped a Band-Aid tight enough to leave an oval, and beneath the photo she wrote, I mend fast.\n\nThat night, on the boardwalk that pretends the river likes to be civilized, Earl took Joy for sushi and managed, with a face like a man squaring up to a bull, to get a piece of tuna into his mouth without once looking betrayed. Joy took a picture of his eyes going wide like a child who has eaten snow for the first time and sent it to me with a caption that said, Look what the world can stand. Her fuzz had become a line, and the line had ideas. She kept touching it as if to remind it there would be scalp for it to visit if it would just act decent in public. Darla watched them from a polite distance like a woman hiding a smile in a chapel and texted me a list I didn\u2019t deserve: the registry draft had come back with teeth intact, Lorraine had set a date for a first committee that would not call itself a committee, and the hospital had quietly returned her access to a few rooms without returning her badge, which is how institutions apologize when they want someone to be grateful and forgetful on schedule.\n\nThe bar set its little table near the back of my week and asked me to sit up straight and be small. Mrs. Hale arrived early with a tote bag that might well have been older than I am, and set out papers like plates. She touched my wrist once\u2014not for tenderness, for calibration\u2014and told me again which adjectives were the kind that get a man admired at supper and fired at breakfast. The panel wore the faces of people who had looked forward to noon and found themselves again at nine-thirty. I opened my mouth and closed it and then remembered to begin where Mrs. Hale had told me to: with verbs. I advised. I witnessed. I filed. I did not sell hope; I described a choice. If any of my sentences tried to sit on a lap they didn\u2019t belong in, Mrs. Hale cleared her throat in a register that could cut paper. When they asked about the radio, I said that telling the truth is marketing\u2019s older sister and the one who always stays to do dishes. When they asked if I profited, I told them I had learned to make my own sandwiches. When they asked about the line where I had said you can\u2019t enjoin hope, I said I had been sentimental and meant I had been clumsy and then did not repeat it, which is a thing I am proud of because it is not my habit.\n\nWhen they came back, their decision wore a suit that fit fine. Dismissed with admonition. It read like the note a careful teacher writes in the margin of a boy\u2019s good essay where the paragraphs had gotten in an argument and had to be separated. Do not use the word miracle in any setting where a microphone may be present. Do not sign anything that smells like medicine. Do not use your mother as an argument unless directly asked. They did not put that last one in ink. They did not need to.\n\nWe celebrated by doing something ordinary badly. Pil dragged us to the fair out on the edge of town where the Ferris wheel lifts you exactly high enough to regret the view and then brings you back. The air smelled like grease and something whose sugar had been set on fire and forgiven. We stood in line like men who have not been allowed to stand in lines because other men have been calling their names out of them. Oakes showed up with his violin in a case he did not intend to open and opened it anyway because a child asked him to, and he found a corner where the speakers couldn\u2019t insult him and played. He didn\u2019t play anything anyone could hum after. He played the kind of tune that only exists in the ear where it is first heard and then refuses to travel. Sloan stood two yards away with his hands in his pockets and his head tilted and I watched him do the thing he had not been doing, which was to let his face be disorganized with pleasure. Joy reached the top of the wheel and shouted into the evening not a word, but a noise that felt like a hand slicing through water and finding it colder and better than expected. Earl held her ankle the way fathers hold ankles by muscle memory, and when they came down she held a prize she had not won, a blue bear with eyes too large for the head the way some mercies are too large for the days that carry them.\n\nWe had a week. I won\u2019t call it peace, because peace is presumptuous. It was a stretch of days when the worst thing I had to contend with was a man at the hardware store wanting to tell me his cousin had been misdiagnosed in \u201898 and what we were doing now would have saved her then, and what did I propose to do about that particular time travel. The trucks came and did not pretend to be lost. The pharmacies on the dead-end streets got deliveries before the ones in the neighborhoods where the houses had cul-de-sacs like rings. The site visit produced a draft report that did not flinch at names, and the board responded with jargon that made me want to iron my tongue. Lorraine wrote me a four-line email that said as much with fewer nouns: We found a spine. Keep your nose clean. Bring us the next three patients. Do not confuse applause with progress.\n\nThe warehouse men did not forget how to curse a day. They switched tactics the way men do when a door closes softly and makes them wonder who paid for the hinge. Somebody dumped a stack of copy paper into the alley behind the office because our shredder had broken the week we started taking ourselves seriously and I hadn\u2019t replaced it. Aimee went out with a broom and an expression she reserves for men wearing sandals with socks. She swept up the blank pages and said, without venting any heat she might have had a right to, that some folks don\u2019t know the difference between mess and message. Someone let the air out of my tires and left four quarters on the hood like payment. I rolled the coins between my fingers and put them in a drawer where I keep kinds of currency that will not spend the way their faces suggest.\n\nOne night, the office learned a new kind of quiet. The old hat store hum is familiar to me now; the building and I share our small noises like people who have chosen to be married in a town that doesn\u2019t know what to do with them. This quiet had weight. The lock didn\u2019t protest. Whoever it was had practiced not making doorways take sides. I was sitting on the floor behind my desk because the chair had begun to feel like a perch and my knees needed to understand ground again. The man with the clean teeth wasn\u2019t there. They didn\u2019t send him for this sort of work. Two silhouettes. One held something that glinted. Not a weapon that argued. A blade that predicted. They went to the shelves like men looking for their own names and found nothing but files. A hand tugged at the red thread on the evidence box and then stopped when it met the neat seam of tape signed across by men who believe ink can hold. He looked at the other and made that small sound men make when they\u2019ve been raised not to call out and something still presses on their throat. He set the box down as if it might snake. They left through the front because they wanted me to know they had known where I was and had chosen not to step on my neck. When I stood, my legs had that song you get after a run you didn\u2019t train for and I pressed my palm on the red thread to make sure I could still feel the cordage through the cardboard. Aimee came from the back room holding the big stapler like a joke she was committed to and said, very calmly, that she would install a bell that made enough racket to please God.\n\nIf the town had any doubt about itself, the storm cleared it. A feeder band off a hurricane that didn\u2019t know how to be generous came up the Pearl like an argument. The sky cast a green I associate only with the seconds before someone says something they cannot unsay. Power went out in clumps. Saint Rose\u2019s generators decided they would like to demonstrate principles instead of performing their duty. Darla called me not to complain but because she has learned I am a man who will bring soup and a cooler and pretend either is a solution and then carry other things without a complaint I have not yet earned the right to make. Aimee took charge of flashlights like a field marshal pressed into service by boredom. Pil went on-air with a battery pack and told the town where the limbs were down and which grocery would sell you ice if you told the cashier your mother\u2019s name without smiling. Sloan showed up at the hospital in a shirt he did not deserve to sweat through and lifted boxes until his breath got messy and then he lifted more because he understands now that the body insists on being present for justice and not just the voice.\n\nIn the dim, Joy\u2019s room had the glow you get when the machines have decided not to perform for the audience and the human bodies do what they were taught by older human bodies. Earl fanned with a church program stolen from a funeral that had had better music than preaching. Joy made a joke about how much air costs when you get it by the ounce and then apologized to the nurse because she had made it all the way to a place past fear where humor becomes a skin you can live in. Darla moved like a woman reading a dance step that had been written for a floor that had warped overnight. The drug hung and dripped its careful repetitions. The antibiotic did its old-fashioned courage. We took turns pushing a cart back and forth between the pharmacy and the rooms whose lights were lying about their capacity to comfort.\n\nAt some hour that had forgotten which side of midnight to claim, we walked the hallway and saw a door ajar that never is. The supply closet had blown its cover again, or perhaps had chosen to. A box we did not need tipped forward and put its face on the floor. The thing we did need sat patient at the back like a shy child in a classroom that\u2019s learned to reward noise. Something in me that had been on its half-knees for a month stood. We took what the order permitted and what the night demanded. We signed nothing. We made a note. We slid the packages into the coolers that had held other known mercies and kept them cold the way a town keeps the names of the dead without pretending it likes the chore. Dawn arrived like a man late to a meeting: breathless, wrong shirt, eager to convince us it had meant well all along.\n\nWhen the lights came back, the town clapped at nothing in particular and wept where it had stashed its water. Sloan showed up at my office with a piano bench under his arm and I suppose that is a sentence only my life gets to hold. He set it down, and then, almost sheepish, pulled a cheap keyboard from a case and plugged it into an outlet as if he were a teenager who had gotten his first amplification without a parent present. He played me what he\u2019d promised\u2014the stubborn lovely\u2014and I sat in my chair and realized my chair could be a pew if it wanted to and that I had been wrong to ask it to be only a place for taking calls that hurt. He didn\u2019t ask me if it was any good because he had stopped needing my permission for his breath. When he finished, he said, without looking up, that he had given his notice.\n\nHe had done it quietly, because there are men in this world who do not owe an explosion, and he had written it in a hand that tried not to look like it was scripting a divorce and failed. He would stay through the month. He would see the motion through and he would take whatever punishment men like McCreedy thought they had earned the right to deliver by dint of owning floors we must walk across. He would then\u2014here his voice went unsteady and correct itself\u2014he would then work out of his house for a while, a room with a door and a little old wood that had learned where to creak and how to hush. His wife had agreed. His boy had clapped without knowing why. The office had blinked and smiled with only one side of its mouth. The town would do what towns do: pretend it had predicted it and take credit for encouraging him once by sitting attentively when he had said something handsome on a panel.\n\nThere is a moment in every new correctness where you look for permission and find, to your surprise, that the person you want to ask is asleep. Mrs. Hale, who never naps, allowed herself fifteen minutes in the chair in her back room and told the receptionist to wake her if someone came in with anything that smelled like a summary judgment. Lorraine sent a note saying she\u2019d like to set a date for the pilot that could not be called a pilot and suggested that date be just far enough out to suggest responsibility and just near enough to imply urgency. The judge issued an order on a procurement email that read like a mother\u2019s note left on a counter for a son who had taken the car and not called: Tell me where you were. Tell me who you were with. Tell me why you did not think I would wait up.\n\nWe took Joy to the river in the middle of the week because her list did not respect the calendar. It rained a little in sunshine, which is the only weather I believe in. She lay back on a blanket that had seen more grass than laundry and looked at the kind of blue that has something in it you can\u2019t get your hands on. She dictated the letter to her twelve-year-old self because writing tired her. Dear Joy, you will think you are a joke for so long. You are not. You will think Earl is a fool and he is and he isn\u2019t. You will think your hair is your personality and you will be wrong and then right. You will think the river is only summer and you will not know it freezes at the edges and the middle still moves. Fold this and put it near the peas. The brain likes to think in gardens. Her mother cried in that way women cry when other people might lay claim to the sadness if it runs, and wiped her eyes on the oranges scarf and then looked annoyed she had left marks on the fruit.\n\nWe got word from Buckley\u2019s sisters that his numbers had tilted in a way that made them take out their good bowls. One sent a picture of him on the porch with the dog asleep on his foot like a weighted blanket, his cheeks fallen less and his eyes gone bright in a way that made me wonder if the drug doesn\u2019t, in a small way, instruct the soul to behave. We sent back a recipe for a soup he wouldn\u2019t make, because men like Buckley do not make soup. They ask the women whose hair they comb to make it and then insist on doing the dishes and chip a plate on purpose to announce they should never be allowed in the kitchen again. Darla drove out once at dusk with a trunk full of refrigerated stubbornness and all the words she had promised herself she would never say at a stranger\u2019s table and said them anyway. She called me from the road, and I could hear the kind of dark where trees practice being taller, and said, very softly, that his sisters had wanted to pray and she had allowed them to and had put her hand on a shoulder the way women do when the prayer needs a body to land on.\n\nThe bears kept arriving. It had become a language, and I resented my fluency. The next had a stitch down the back as neat as a zipper and inside\u2014a name tag from a charity gala where men had swapped jackets and stories without embarrassment. The next had no cut at all, just a pin in the paw with a note that said we are patient, and that one I gave to Joy after pulling the pin and she laughed and named it Patience because children, even when they have been in rooms where numbers decide everything, still enjoy turning a threat into a pet. Elise came by the office and fixed the loose thread on that one with such efficiency that I understood why men had once mistaken women like her for magicians and then punished them for it. She stayed for coffee and told Aimee she had been at the bank and seen a teller explain compound interest to a boy without condescension and had to sit down on the curb and breathe because it had been so beautiful. Then she stood and said she had pies in the car and would bring one only if we swore to bring the tin back with its dignity, and left without waiting for our oath because she knows us.\n\nThe AG\u2019s office\u2014which is to say, one man who cannot keep a secret and one woman who never will\u2014issued a letter that said the word investigation without apology. Lorraine sent it to me with an attachment that contained more redactions than sense, and I wrote back a note I will keep for the rest of my life because of how few words it took to be correct. We were not wrong. She replied with a single period and I understood I had, at last, earned punctuation.\n\nOn a Saturday, when all decent upheavals ought to rest, Sloan asked me to meet him at the courthouse. He had gotten permission from the janitor, who understands the law of mop buckets and music and treats them both as liquid. In the rotunda, where once the echo had belonged only to men who liked to hear their jokes returned to them twice, Sloan set up his keyboard and Oakes stood like a man who had been waiting his whole life to be allowed to be this version of himself in a public building. They played together without speaking, two instruments remembering what a bridge is for, and people drifted in because the town knows when air changes. The deputy leaned in the door with his hat in his hand. Miss Laverne stood under the mural and cried with her mouth closed. A child lay down on the tile to feel the sound better because children know acoustics in their bones. I stood and let my face loosen where it wanted and I did not apologize for it then or later. Between songs, Sloan said, like a man who had discovered an extra room in his own house, that he had taken a lease on the old hat repair shop two doors down from me and would be teaching a few piano students on weekdays and some men who needed to learn what their wrists were for on Saturdays. He looked afraid and certain in the precise amounts needed to be forgiven in advance.\n\nThat night, I slept under my mother\u2019s quilt with the window open and the fan doing its clicking metronome. The street sounded like a town that had worked and washed and gone to bed without finishing every task and forgiven itself for it. My phone sat face down like a respectful witness. When I woke, I had dreamed nothing sententious and felt for the cut at the crease of my thumb and found that it had knitted without me watching. Downstairs, a letter waited from Lorraine with a letterhead that still surprises me because I am not used to being written to by the state without dread. She wanted Darla in Jackson on Monday to sit in a room where a whiteboard would pretend to contain the choices of a whole body, and she wanted me to come, too, only to carry a folder and not to speak unless someone needed a sentence taken apart and sewn back together.\n\nWe dressed like we were going to a funeral that had been postponed and went to sit in a room where people had brought their own pens and had decided that day would obey them. Carrow sat quietly and earned the attention of a woman whose attention had been late to waking. A statistician with a haircut that could have been used to cut paper wrote numbers in a way that made the air relax because the slash of a seven had not been enlisted to lie. Darla spoke like water, steady and insistent and bending around some rocks. I spoke once and made a joke that did its work and then shut up, which is the kind of victorious maturity that ought to win a man a prize he does not need. A schedule went up under the kind of heading men like me can die under\u2014Pilot, North District, Phase One\u2014and we all pretended not to see the irony and wrote names under months like children at the chalkboard pretending school is permanent.\n\nDriving home, the fields had that September lie where they look done when they are not. The magnolias had traded their lacquer for dust, and the freight train made a sound like grease, and Meridian did that thing where it made itself smaller to fit into your chest and then larger just to prove it could. A text from Buckley\u2019s sisters came through saying he had slept a whole night and dreamed about a fence his daddy had built wrong and we all knew what that meant: the body had decided, briefly, to continue. Joy sent a photo of the freezer with a letter tucked behind the peas and a smile that did not run from its own face. Aimee had bought a new shredder and had put a ribbon around it and told the office it should greet it with respect. Elise had baked, which meant we had won something temporary and beautiful.\n\nI pulled into my drive and saw, at the base of the pecan, a box with no return address and a ribbon that had cost someone more than decency dictates. Inside, a bear with no seam cut and no pin and no card. Around its belly, a small belt of measuring tape like the kind my mother used to snap when she wanted my shoulders to behave. The tape had numbers that didn\u2019t line up, and for a second my throat did that closing thing grief and laughter use in common. I took the tape off, coiled it, and put it in the drawer where I keep other instruments no one has asked me to play. The bear went on the chair beneath the quilt and did its small, silly work of making the room remember it could hold softness and peril in adjacent chairs without one swallowing the other.\n\nI was making coffee I didn\u2019t need when the phone rang with the sound I have learned to call urgent without letting it claim my whole face. Lorraine\u2019s voice had that thread of iron she keeps coiled for use, and she said the words any town like ours has been waiting to have to hear and not hear. The AG\u2019s office had served warrants. Someone had bent, and not the person whose bending would have been satisfying. A procurement manager had confessed before she had been asked to. A warehouse bookkeeper had discovered his god. Auxiliary had dissolved itself overnight like sugar in hot water and left behind the aftertaste of cheap mint. There would be charges. There would be statements. There would be Sunday. She said, as if we were talking about rain, that we should expect a parade and an ambush and that sometimes in life they are the same block.\n\nI stood with the phone to my ear and watched the steam write its ceremony in the kitchen air and then vanish, and I thought of the seam in the courthouse rotunda where two old stones meet and how, if you run your finger along it, you can feel the line but it will not cut you. I thought of Sloan, who would be learning a new quiet in his house, and of Darla, who would be buying a dress with pockets not because of the meeting but because she had remembered what to put in them. I thought of Joy, who would be making a list of things you can do with hair two inches long that you cannot do with hair you hide inside a scarf, and of Earl, who would say sushi now as if it were his idea. I thought of Elise, who would be mending the hem of a banner we would one day walk beneath without forgetting who held the needle while the town debated its font.\n\nAnd I thought of my mother, which is to say I thought of the way she would squint at the stitch and nod and then, because she knew a seam alone is not a garment, pick up the other piece and ask me to hold the far edge while she made a join that could stand a season.Chapter 10\n\nSunday arrived pretending to be kind. The sky had that pale, freshly laundered look that makes even bad siding on old houses look intentional. Pecan leaves held still like a congregation caught mid-breath. I ironed a shirt I had no business ironing because the cloth didn\u2019t deserve heat and care that early in the week, but some mornings you need to do something with a hot plate and a stubborn crease to make the rest of the day believe you can finish it. My mother\u2019s quilt looked restful on the chair, sage and russet and three squares that never quite match because she\u2019d run out of one print and refused to pretend the replacement had always been the plan. When the coffee went from impatient steam to something like a ceremony, my phone buzzed with messages that made a small, nervous music on the counter. Aimee: wear a jacket with inside pockets and do not say you\u2019ll give it to me later because you won\u2019t. Pil: parade starts at two, I\u2019ve got a spot by the bandstand, keep your metaphors to what fits between a drumroll and a sponsor mention. Sloan: the janitor is a saint; if the weather holds I\u2019ll set up in the rotunda after the thing with the floats. Lorraine: press conference noon; state will speak like a grown-up; bring one copy of everything that makes you feel taller.\n\nMeridian\u2019s Founders\u2019 Day parade has always been more confession than celebration. We line up our tractors not because we need to but because we like to see if the paint still shines; we put our middle schoolers in matching T-shirts so they can practice the synchronized embarrassment that will take them into high school; the churches build floats with themes that would make you blush if you had time to think about where the glue came from. The warehouse men sponsor the water table, and the tablecloth always has their logo repeating like a wallpaper pattern in a room you don\u2019t get to sit down in. This year there was a banner stitched by the quilting circle that had been mended so well you wouldn\u2019t have seen the seam unless a woman raised you right pointed it out. Miss Laverne stood under it in a shirt with more starch than a principled apology and gave orders with a chin you could have measured your courage against.\n\nJoy wore a headband no one would accuse of being practical. The fuzz had declared itself hair sometime between Friday morning and Saturday night, and she had decided, with that meticulous mercy she gives herself on good days, to let it be seen and not just touched by hands that ask permission. Darla wore a dress with pockets because I had promised to bring her a pen that doesn\u2019t run and soup; she had found the pockets and put her hands in like a woman choosing not to be argued with. Earl had folded the parade route map and placed it inside his back pocket and then pulled it out and put it back in until the crease remembered where it belonged. Elise stood near the church float with a pair of scissors in her cardigan pocket and a look that said if anybody pulled a thread they hadn\u2019t earned, she knew how to cut a man\u2019s metaphor in half.\n\nBefore the parade, the courthouse steps filled with the kind of crowd that shows up for free water and breaks for justice when it\u2019s offered. Lorraine didn\u2019t take the mic; that\u2019s not her show. The state\u2019s lawyer with the neat part and the low voice stood with a poster-board of bullet points that had never felt more like ammunition and said, without ceremony, that Auxiliary Logistics had been \u201cdissolved under scrutiny,\u201d that sealed boxes had become open questions, that a procurement manager had entered a plea to something with the kind of consonants people pretend not to hear, and that donors do not cure scarcity by inventing it. She kept the nouns close together and let the verbs do their work. When she finished, no one clapped. Meridian doesn\u2019t applaud announcements the way cities do. We let the words sit and see if they start to smell like truth when the day warms them a little.\n\nThe ambush, of course, came with a smile. It always does, because men who train their faces to sell you a refrigerator in winter do not unlearn the softness that keeps you from slamming the door. He wore a volunteer sash that let him approach any body with a clipboard and a bottle of water. He called me Barry like we were cousins and handed me a manila folder with a label in a font I know too well to trust. The other hand held an identical folder for Darla. \u201cJust so you\u2019re informed,\u201d he said, and glanced toward the photographers who had discovered the angle of a lawsuit looks prettier than a promise when you\u2019re trying to make a front page behave. I didn\u2019t look at the camera, because my mother would have scolded me with her eyebrows and told me to read before I performed.\n\nThe complaint called us wicked names in courteous language. Defamation and interference and a fanciful paragraph about \u201cmisappropriation of institutional goodwill\u201d that made me want to iron the strip of paper it was printed on until the letters begged for mercy and promised to behave. They had cut Joy\u2019s parents into the suit like a seam you add last minute when you realize the garment won\u2019t hang; they wore the words \u201cconspiracy of public confusion\u201d and I felt Earl\u2019s breath go wrong even through three feet of air. He is a man who pretends not to care what the town says about him until the town says it loud enough for the girls to hear. Darla didn\u2019t flinch; she took the pages with the same hand she uses to hold a vein steady and slid them into the pocket I\u2019d admired. \u201cWe have a parade,\u201d she said to the volunteer. \u201cYou have a conscience. Let\u2019s see which of us can find what we need first.\u201d\n\nWhen I looked up, Sloan was already moving toward the courthouse. He has cultivated a stillness lately, but on certain days he remembers motion is permissible for men who intend to be decent. He didn\u2019t touch my arm and I didn\u2019t need him to. In the rotunda, he set his keyboard where men used to set petitions and played the thing he refuses to title that makes my chest decide to behave for a full two minutes. People drifted from floats and water stations and the edges of their own intentions and let the sound remind their faces what they would like to believe they look like. The warehouse men stood under the second-floor rail the way owls pretend to be part of architecture. One adjusted his cuff again; one checked his phone like phones absolve us from having to check our hearts.\n\nLorraine\u2019s press conference did what it owed. It gave people a sentence to say at lunch that does not make them sound like they slept through the morning. \u201cThe state secured warrants\u201d works in almost any conversation if you season it with a good side-eye. It also let the hospital rehearse a statement in which they used the phrase \u201cisolated administrative lapses\u201d and \u201cunforeseen downstream effects\u201d and a paragraph about \u201cthe importance of patient-centered care\u201d that would have sat better if it hadn\u2019t been announced by a man whose pencil line hair and clean fingertips made me think of how careful he must be not to get real ink on anything. Pil took to the airwaves with that delighted sobriety he reserves for days when he gets to say the word accountability without having to use the words allegedly and forthcoming. He called me live and asked for a sentence he could fit before the citrus farm ad, and I said, \u201cWe learned to carry a file box like a baby and it paid off,\u201d and he groaned and said he would edit my metaphors in post and keep the baby.\n\nThe parade went on because towns do not cancel tradition for truth; they carry both and get shin splints. The high school band tried to march in a straight line down a street that refuses to be honest about its width. The Shriners did their little car ballet that shapes a figure eight so pretty you forget half the drivers are accountants who cry at the price of wood. A float sponsored by a chain pharmacy had an oversized pill bottle painted with a smile that would have unsettled me on any other day; today it felt like a fairytale eaten by an after-school special. The church banner sailed past with its mended hem daring any camera to zoom and find the stitch. Elise walked beside it holding a stick with the calm of a woman who has been asked to steady men all her life and has chosen, finally, to let the fabric do some of its own work.\n\nThe ambush\u2019s second act stepped out of a white tent with pastries. A boy in a polo with a logo that had not existed last week offered Joy\u2019s mother a check the way you offer a woman a chair when she isn\u2019t sure if she\u2019s allowed to sit. \u201cA family assistance gift,\u201d he said, and pretended not to notice the photographers doing their good-citizen crouch. The number was too round to be nice. Darla looked at the paper like it was a stain on a tablecloth she had just laundered. Earl\u2019s mouth flattened and his hand went toward his back pocket and then stopped because the map was there and maps are for directions, not for fists.\n\n\u201cYou can refuse money without refusing people,\u201d Darla said to nobody in particular and everybody in earshot. She is better than I am at saying the sentence you want the town to repeat instead of the one it will. Joy took the check, folded it in half without looking at the amount, handed it to her mother, and said, with the easy teenage cruelty that saves lives when it is correctly applied, \u201cYou can mail them a thank-you from the future when I\u2019m done needing it.\u201d Her mother smiled the tight smile of a woman who will accept a kind that isn\u2019t clean only to change it into clean later in the kitchen with a pair of scissors and a stamp and the good pen.\n\nI took Darla\u2019s stack of pages into the shade and skimmed while the marching girls did a routine that made my knees hurt in sympathy. The suit had been filed in a county friendlier to glossy folders than to quilts. It was signed by a firm from a city that sells glass for a living. It wanted to enjoin our tongues and wrists and computers and the path from the pharmacy loading bay to the street. It wanted to erase Elise with a red pen and to put Lorraine in a box labeled Overstep. It named Oakes because they needed a musician to make the story less about women who sew. Mrs. Hale, who somehow knows when the air goes sour in any building that keeps paper, texted that she was in her office with a pot of tea and two kinds of response already half-written, and to bring my face and not my feelings.\n\nBy the time the parade thinned into children dragging plastic sacks with five peppermints and a pocket handful of heat, the ambush had softened into neighborliness again. Men who had shouted my name in the morning nodded as if seeing me in public had made me less likely to be an idea they disagreed with. Sloan finished his impromptu concert without bowing and without begging the crowd for anything more than air. He stayed seated for a long moment, hands on his thighs, eyes on the keyboard like a man reading a letter he knows he will keep in the same drawer as his father\u2019s watch. When he looked up, the room had the sweet awkwardness of a gathering that doesn\u2019t know if it just witnessed something sacred or secular and would like to be told how to behave. He did not instruct them. He put his bench under one arm and carried the keyboard out like a man who had never been allowed to move furniture and had finally decided to lift his share without asking permission.\n\nAt Mrs. Hale\u2019s, the light through the old glass windows made a warp on the floor that seemed designed to catch bad arguments where they might trip. She read the complaint the way she reads a menu\u2014curious, decisive, refusing to be intimidated by adjectives. \u201cWe can\u2019t anti-SLAPP our way out of this in this state,\u201d she said, handing me a clipping from a law journal she keeps to remind herself which neighbors have nicer tools, \u201cbut we can cut away the parts that want to be costume and leave them in their underwear long enough to embarass the men who dressed them up.\u201d We drafted something that smelled like calm and carried inside it a small, sharp thing that would nick anyone who tried to hold it too hard. She told me when to breathe. She told me which sentences would make me look like a man who talks to himself in the mirror and which would make me look like a man you could hand a baby to and go find a towel. She took the check from Joy\u2019s mother, which had found its way to my pocket like all hot things do, and said, \u201cWe will endorse it to a fund. We will put six names on the account. We will not allow one man to put a hand on a girl\u2019s head and call it generosity.\u201d\n\nWe filed. We walked the papers to the clerk with our elbows in the right kind of angle. Out in the hall, the warehouse man with the immaculate smile offered me something approximating a grin and said, \u201cYou have a fine day, Barrett,\u201d in a tone that meant he had decided to move from threats to politeness because the cameras had rested. I told him to put sunscreen on the tips of his ears because the sun had become unkind, and he touched his ear involuntarily the way men are taught not to, and for an instant he looked as human as anyone I know. It is hard to stay angry at a face you have persuaded into checking whether it is burning.\n\nThe hospital moved like an organism trying out a new gait. An internal memo admitted to \u201cunhelpful enthusiasm\u201d in procurement, which is the sort of phrase men who want to stay employed write when they have learned nothing and wish to confess it with their wrists. Darla\u2019s privileges were reinstated in a way that would play well in a hearing, a partial keycard, access to the floors with patient names she could conjure in her sleep, and a little note in the system that said See admin for special protocols, which is how you apologize in a building where apology looks like a workflow. She stood in the lobby with her hands in her pockets and let herself be scanned back into a place that had made a theater of pushing her out. The guard who used to bring the cupcakes from his wife nodded like a man who had made the cupcakes himself and had been told he had done a fair job. She took the elevator and the lights did their polite ascending, and when the doors opened on a floor she had missed more than she had allowed, she did not cry. She adjusted a cuff. She caught sight of a nurse she\u2019d trained when that woman was still flinching at needles, and they picked up an old conversation without fuss.\n\nJoy asked, on Monday, to go to school for one hour. It was a request that arrived like a shoe thrown at a door in an otherwise well-behaved day. The principal had been practicing sorrow for weeks in the mirror and had gotten good enough to frighten her own dog; she said yes with a flurry of forms and a note to teachers that had too many adverbs in it. I walked Joy in because Earl had used up his courage on the parade. The hallway air had that institutional chill that promises fairness until the thermostat breaks. A girl in a sweatshirt with the sleeves cut off and a headband that took no prisoners hugged Joy and then stood back and said, \u201cYour head is trying to beat mine,\u201d which is the kind of compliment you keep for days when you need to remember girls will save us if we let them. A teacher put a hand out for a paper that didn\u2019t exist and then found the right hand and put it on Joy\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cBe bored,\u201d which is, I have discovered, one of the holiest blessings we have.\n\nOn the way back to the truck, a boy with the posture of someone who will be handsome when he is tired waved a copy of the local paper and asked if I really had sued the hospital. I told him I had sued nobody and asked the court to remind adults what the word hurry means. He said he liked the word spry better and I agreed and told him to teach it to his grandfather. He said his grandfather would not listen and then laughed and said he would try anyway because men who don\u2019t like to be instructed like to be argued with if you make it feel like a game.\n\nThe suit did not slow the pilot Lorraine had dressed in such decent language it could survive in any climate. Carrow called from Jackson to say the committee that will not call itself a committee had been scheduled for Tuesday in a room with plastic chairs that pretended not to squeak. The registry had teeth and a small whistle attached for emergencies. They had printed badges not because the work required them but because the work wanted to feel like a club it could justify. Darla asked me to check the language on a consent form that had been written by a person with a clean conscience and a bad ear. I took my pen and made the words ordinary enough to belong in a kitchen. We added a line about what to do if a woman changed her mind and a paragraph about where to put your fear if you didn\u2019t want to wear it in your face all day. The administrator in the room looked grateful and then troubled because gratitude feels like treason in some rooms. She took her troubled face outside and came back with sugar cookies.\n\nElise and the quilt ladies devised a protection scheme that would not make the papers because it did not involve men. They decided whose porches would be watched by which women after which choir practice. They traded recipes with instructions like code. Bring the cassava to L\u2019s at nine meant somebody had seen the car with the tint that didn\u2019t belong. They tucked extra needles into pockets because a woman carrying a needle cannot be accused of violence by anyone who can be shamed. They watched the service at the other church on the corner online and counted heads and frowned when a new head did not bow at the right words. Elise brought me a pie with a crust that flaked like a good memory and told me without looking at me that when she dies she wants lyrics on her bulletin that the men do not know so their mouths will move without sound for once and we will see what that looks like on their faces.\n\nThe warehouse men did not idle. Someone with nimble fingers and a willingness to work in the dark turned off the breaker to my sign and left the fuse box door hanging open like a dare. Aimee put a sticky note on it that said Close your own door and taped it shut with blue painter\u2019s tape because she does not believe in leaving residue anyone else will have to scrub. Boone called to say a man had tried to pay for antibiotics in cash that smelled like shared pockets and he had sent him away with dewormer because Boone believes men who lie to feed stores should at least have the courtesy to care for their animals. Mrs. Hale told me to sleep on the couch in my office with my jacket under my head if I intended to stay late drafting, because she had read too many books in which men fall asleep in chairs and die and she did not intend to attend two funerals in a season.\n\nWhen the AG\u2019s first set of charges were read publicly, I did not feel triumph. I felt the way your hands feel when you have just finally loosened a knot that came from a bad habit; relief edged by the knowledge you tied it yourself somewhere along the way by letting things be tidy that shouldn\u2019t have been. A bookkeeper cried in a way that suggests he had been waiting to cry at something innocuous and had decided to allow himself this. A donor put out a statement written by a person who uses old words like steward in new places because they sound ancestral and forgets that stewardship requires sheep. Lorraine sent two words to my phone\u2014Keep going\u2014and I looked at them longer than I needed to because I needed to look at something short that felt correct.\n\nBuckley\u2019s sisters sent voice notes because their hands were busy with hair. One had sat behind him on the couch and braided while the other read a short story out loud she had found on the internet that would have been awful if she\u2019d had taste but was perfect because she did not. He laughed in the right places, which is medicine we have not bottled. He slept two nights in a row, which is grace we do not get to schedule. When Darla went out with a cooler and a legal pad and the name of a vet who will forever be excused from one small lie on his taxes, she came back with a look that was neither saintly nor smug. \u201cHe is getting tired in the way that looks like health when your body remembers how to be wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cHe yelled at a sister because she salted the green beans before she tasted and then apologized and that apology was the most alive thing I have held in a week.\u201d\n\nToward the end of the week, I found on my chair not a bear but a tailor\u2019s tape, the soft cloth kind, the numbers dark and honest. It was the sort of tape you use when you agree that bodies change and you will not punish them for it. Someone had scratched out two numbers in the thirties and replaced them with three and four but in handwriting that looked like a child\u2019s. There was no note. The tape did not smell of smoke or glue; it smelled like a drawer and a hand. I unrolled it on my desk and laid it next to a pleading and the tin of my mother\u2019s needles and the sandwich Aimee had put there without asking if I had eaten. The tape lay in a curve that made the paperwork kinder by proximity. I coiled it back up and put it with the red thread like a small pledge to a craft I had not admitted I practiced in public.\n\nThat night, Meridian performed weather that could have turned either way. The river held its manners. The trees gestured and then decided unison wasn\u2019t necessary. Oakes sat in the doorway of the repair shop that would be a music school soon and tuned something small while a boy in a Spider-Man shirt watched with a concentration you cannot teach. Sloan, from his rented room, texted a picture of a bare wall with a nail in it and wrote, \u201cI could hang the degree or the song,\u201d and I wrote back, \u201cHang the thing that makes your son point.\u201d He sent a photo of the boy\u2019s hand, open and messy, and then a voice note of him whistling the stubborn little tune I have stopped trying to name. I sat on the steps of the office under an untrustworthy bulb and let the sound try the air, and for once the air did not argue.\n\nOn Sunday evening, after we had carried coolers and boxes and words back to their shelves, after the suit had been answered with paper that felt less like a shield than a scarf, after Lorraine had told me in three sentences what a week of governance would cost her and I had promised her a pie I had no right to promise, I walked home under a sky that had decided to try on pink. The town made the little noises it makes when it thinks nobody is paying attention\u2014ice maker chokes and then relents, neighbor laughs at a show with a line a woman wrote who has never been here, dog barks twice in a register that says he knows every car that belongs. In my kitchen, I spread my mother\u2019s quilt over the table because the wood had begun to seem insufficient, and I took the tape into my hands and pulled it without thinking from zero to twenty-three. The fabric gave under my fingers and then did not, and I remembered how she would snap it against my wrist when she wanted me to stop fidgeting and then kiss the place the snap had marked for an hour. I put the tape down and laughed out loud because the world had gotten away with something, and for once I did not immediately try to name it.\n\nOn Monday morning, the courthouse smelled the way wood smells when it forgives you for leaning against it, and the clerk looked at me like a man she had decided would sit when instructed and talk when allowed and not take the pen she offers home in his pocket. We had work and we did not call it a battle because it isn\u2019t one if you know where your sewing kit is. A boy with a mop who had been taught to move quietly stopped when he saw the red thread around our evidence box and asked if we needed more tape. I told him we needed less fear. He said he could get us a sandwich, and I told him he had understood something better than half the attorneys I have stood next to under stained glass and pretended to admire. He smiled and went back to practicing his straight lines. He will leave this town or he will stay and make it better. I am trying, this week, to be the kind of man who lets either of those decisions be the right one.\n\nBy afternoon, our pilot-that-is-not had sprouted a schedule with names that tasted like real people instead of case numbers: Joy and Buckley and Mrs. Ludwig who does not own cattle but knows men with feed stores, and two women from across the river whose church has not decided whether we are an ethical experiment or an unpunished wish. The trucks arrived without fuss and were unloaded by men who had found a different rhythm than the one that lets you stack boxes and forget the names on the labels belong to breath. Someone taped a note on the pharmacy breakroom refrigerator that said, \u201cTake one. Take care. Tell me if you can\u2019t,\u201d and it was unsigned and in a hand I will spend a long time trying to place.\n\nWe are not done. I know that because the suit exists and because men who have been embarrassed late are more dangerous than men who have been forgiven early. I know it because the tape on my desk can be coiled wrong and left in a drawer and forgotten while other hands lift other measurements and call them fair. But on this particular evening, the town felt mended in a way that did not lie about its rips. Joy sat on her porch and ate a popsicle during the hour the mosquito trucks are supposed to save us and never do, hair stubborn and eyebrows having remembered their job; Earl listened to a song he did not understand the words to twice and nodded both times as if he owed the music respect even if it never paid it back; Darla stood in the doorway of a room she had been uninvited from and made a note on a chart with her good pen; Sloan taught a man who owns a renting business how to make his left hand jealous of his right; Elise put her scissors in a drawer and sat with her feet up like a queen whose throne has the low back of a kitchen chair and a cushion that\u2019s lost its plump.\n\nI turned out the lights in the office and left the sign off on purpose. The street had enough brightness in other windows to carry me home without a stumble. On my table, the tape lay where I\u2019d left it, and I put my hand on it like a man taking an oath nobody asked him to make and said, out loud because the room had earned it, that I would keep what\u2019s inside inside until the day came when letting it out would save more than it might ruin. Then I laughed again at myself and at the town and at the way a piece of cloth with numbers on it can feel like a future, and I slept under my mother\u2019s quilt with the ribbon of the fan\u2019s click counting us through the night like a metronome that has decided the song will hold even if the measure goes a little long.",

                              "content": "The morning I decided to betray my profession for something wilder than precedent, the air over Meridian tasted like warm copper and magnolia syrup. The courthouse steps sweated, and the big clock above the clerk\u2019s office seemed to tick in lumps. Meridian has always been a town that wears its history like a suit a shade too tight. Threads show around the elbows. People pretend they don\u2019t notice.\n\nI\u2019d been practicing law a decade by then, which is to say I\u2019d learned to hold my breath while rooms filled with other people\u2019s stenched-up grievances. I did divorces, property disputes, a few slips and falls\u2014nothing heroic, nothing that left much of a mark except where it rubbed me thin. Outside my office window the train tracks buzzed, and the sky broke into its usual fragile blue. Clients liked to see that blue; juries liked to have it in their periphery. They were teddy-bear folk that way, needing softness somewhere even if all they got was color.\n\nMy name is Barrett, though most of Meridian still calls me Barry despite all my efforts to age into something crisper. I\u2019m tall when I remember to stand right. Some days the cuff of my shirt will catch on a drawer and I\u2019ll feel an unreasonable irritation, a tug, as if some stitch of me is not properly hidden. You\u2019ll laugh; I do not. The best lawyers are the ones who distrust their own seams.\n\nIt was a Tuesday, which is the day of the week where the courthouse coffee tastes like burnt molasses and news of small disasters trickles in from every direction. I was sitting with a man named Oakes in my conference room, discussing the relative merits of keeping his father\u2019s violin or selling it to pay down the lien on the house, when the call came from the hospital. Oakes ran his hand over the back of his neck the way you check for a price tag in a store. That habit survives even in grief.\n\n\u201cGo on,\u201d he told me, after I\u2019d tried to ignore the call twice. \u201cYou\u2019re no good to me pretending I matter more than whatever that is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis matters,\u201d I said automatically. Then I picked up the call. It was Dr. Darla Kettering, the oncologist I\u2019d met pro bono at one of those grim do-gooder panels lawyers sit on to feel less like barnacles.\n\n\u201cMr. Barrett,\u201d she said, skipping my last name because the speaker phone in her office always made mine sound like I\u2019d made it up. \u201cDo you have a minute today or are you in trial?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a client in the room,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I can call you back.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about your mother,\u201d she said, and that cut the air sideways and left me with a ridiculous sweet taste in my mouth, what you taste when cotton gets wet. It had been four years since my mother died, and still that word could pull the room like a rug, drag everything toward its center.\n\n\u201cGive me an hour,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll hold lunch,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou won\u2019t want to rush this.\u201d\n\nAfter I walked Oakes to his truck and told him to keep the violin no matter what anyone else suggested\u2014some objects hold a person-shaped space no court can measure\u2014I drove out to Saint Rose. The hospital\u2019s new wing still had that fresh paint smell that made my nose itch, clean and artificial, like talc sprinkled too thick in a child\u2019s dresser. In the elevator, I could hear my pulse pattering like someone tapping a loose button on a table. The metal walls threw my reflection back at me with a wobble. I rubbed my thumb over my wrist bone. I stopped. The doors slid open.\n\nDarla met me in the hallway and hugged me like we\u2019d already shared something heavy and rough. She was short, with steady, quick eyes and a laugh that could talk anyone off a ledge if she timed it right. She ushered me into her office, where the books looked like they had plastic covers on them that my eye couldn\u2019t quite focus on. For a moment, I thought of my mother\u2019s sewing basket, the tiny jars of buttons and the strawberry-shaped pincushion heavy with metal.\n\n\u201cYou told me you didn\u2019t want to be updated on her file,\u201d Darla began gently. \u201cI know that. But I found something in relation to another patient.\u201d\n\n\u201cFound something.\u201d My voice came out more like an accusation than the question I intended. Lawyers adopt their tones like borrowed suits.\n\n\u201cWe keep the data,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all vote to. It\u2019s anonymized. But you made me curious, Barrett. The way you said\u2014at the funeral\u2014that you were sorry you didn\u2019t understand earlier what kind of thing took her. It stuck with me. Probably not fair. Anyway, this is me being unfair. Sit down.\u201d\n\nI sat. She pushed a thin folder toward me, paper clip holding pages in that brutal tight way, a little tension you can feel through your nails.\n\n\u201cMy patient\u2019s name is Tinsley,\u201d she said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t respond to standard chemo. I wanted to try off-label something with her, and I compared her markers to archived cases. Your mother\u2019s profile is\u2014was\u2014similar. They had a particular damaged loop on chromosome 17. You don\u2019t care about the number. Point is, a drug used for a completely different disease lights up that segment.\u201d\n\n\u201cLights up as in cures?\u201d I said, trying not to lean too far toward the nonsense of hope.\n\n\u201cLights up as in arrests cell lines in vitro, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cIn patients, we have complications. Immune stuff. But listen to me. There\u2019s one more twist. Your mother was given a routine antibiotic near the end when she got an infection. Her white count did something weirder than any white count I have seen. For forty-eight hours, her blast cells stopped replicating.\u201d\n\nI heard this like you hear the phrase, \u201cI found a door,\u201d in a house where you\u2019d lived for years and never looked behind a piece of furniture. \u201cDid anyone notice?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at the time,\u201d she said. \u201cShe was too ill. She had too many other processes failing. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd this other patient? Tinsley?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dosed her with an antibiotic last week,\u201d Darla said. \u201cShe is stable. This is not supposed to work like this. But there is perhaps a synergy. I\u2019ll say the ugly word: cure. Or cure-adjacent. I know I am stepping out of the lines telling you. But I\u2019m telling you because you strike me as the kind of person who doesn\u2019t like lines when they\u2019re arbitrary.\u201d\n\nI stared down at the photocopies, the graphs like low mountains, the months spread in numeric digits. The letters of the antibiotic\u2019s name looked like something I\u2019d seen scrawled on a napkin or a prescription bottle in a joke. The name was old-fashioned and sweet. I thought of my mother muttering to herself over her quilting, the way she\u2019d tug fabric and iron it and then, hold it up to my chest as if measuring something only she understood.\n\n\u201cIf this is real,\u201d I said. \u201cIf this is anything other than a fluke\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be just ours,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cIt would need to be tested, shared, repeated. I brought it to the board. They\u2026 we. They want to wait. There are liability issues. There is the possibility of false hope. There is the hospital\u2019s relationship with donors whose children died. It\u2019s complicated.\u201d\n\nIn the stillness after that word I heard a deep sound like a low cello under the normal beep of the hall monitors. Meridian likes everything to be simple or at least pretend simple. Complicated gets you called arrogant.\n\n\u201cYou want me to sue your hospital into giving your patient an antibiotic I can get at a CVS?\u201d I said. It came out ugly because I needed someone to be angry at.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI want you to talk to Tinsley\u2019s family. To explain the risk. To give me cover to do what I already did.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou already did,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cTwice,\u201d she said, and there was a little smile at the edge of her mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t you find it strange that an oncologist has to ask a lawyer to help her be brave?\u201d\n\nIt was then, thinking of bravery like an object we could both hold, that I felt something else happen. A looseness in my chest, like a seam let out. I could tell you I became a different man in that second, but it\u2019s more accurate to say I started telling a different story about myself. Lawyers are trained story-tellers. Cancer is a story people choke on; we smooth our throats and try again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d I said. \u201cTell me about the family.\u201d\n\nThe Tinsleys turned out to be from the north end of the county, a place of red clay and neighborhoods stacked in with more care than their builders had money for. Their daughter was named Joy, which seemed either bold or cruel, depending on how cynical you were that day. She had hair like unlucky wheat and eyes that made you check to see if your own pupils worked.\n\nJoy listened to me like she\u2019d been practicing for it. Her father, Earl, sat in silence, a demolished man with hands like paddles. Her mother wore a scarf with cartoon oranges on it and kept folding it like there was a right way she might eventually arrive at if she just respected the fabric. When I told them what Darla suspected, a kind of bird-wary hope skittered through the room. Later, when I would talk on the news, people would write that my voice carried \u201cinappropriate enthusiasm.\u201d But in a small room, with a girl holding a cup of melt-water and trying to decide whether to risk a drug that might kill her, enthusiasm is not a sin. It is the only thing that doesn\u2019t feel like betrayal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to die,\u201d Joy said to me simply, and I put my hands on the table because sometimes you have to keep them where you can see them.\n\n\u201cYou might not have to,\u201d I said. \u201cNot this month. Maybe not this year.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just a lawyer,\u201d Earl blurted. Then closed his eyes, ashamed, his lower lip trembling like a seam pulling tight. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry is a spell that works on fabric,\u201d my mother used to say when she ripped out stitches. \u201cIt relaxes the thread.\u201d I looked at Joy, then at Darla. \u201cYour daughter will sign the consent. I will co-sign my name as a witness. The hospital can do what it needs to do with its fears.\u201d\n\nIt should have been enough. In another town, in another lifetime, it might have been. But Meridian has its kings, and men like me are not supposed to crown anybody. That afternoon, I got my first phone call from the district attorney\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cMr. Barrett,\u201d said the voice like ice water. \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d\n\nOf course I remembered him. Sloan Greaves and I had battled over small matters for years: a petty fraud my client had not committed, a brawl in a parking lot where I\u2019d argued the merits of a bruised nose, the politics of a case the newspaper thought smelled good and I thought smelled like smoke from wet cloth. Sloan had an angular face and the kind of hair people in Protestant churches admire, because it looks like it would never betray him and fall in his eyes at the wrong time. We were civil the way two men can be who want to be seen being civil, but we were not friends. In law school, he\u2019d been the golden boy who could recite twenty cases and their holdings without blinking. I, by contrast, once forgot the name of the judge in open court and called him \u201cYour Honor Sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cAssistant District Attorney Greaves,\u201d I said, because he always preferred the full title, perhaps because it sounded like he was one crowded heartbeat away from the main chair. \u201cHow can I serve the People this afternoon?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a complaint,\u201d he said. \u201cA doctor practicing outside accepted protocols. Colluding with a plaintiff\u2019s attorney to deprive the hospital of its shield of reasonableness.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been reading from the tort book,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my best genre.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot reading. Remembering,\u201d he said, and I could hear his smile rubbing the receiver. \u201cThere are also the matters of marketing claims. I hear you\u2019re about to call a press conference. Unwise.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m about to sign a consent form for a patient you and I will never meet,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m about to drive across town and hold a hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m about to file a motion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will seek to enjoin the hospital from deviating from standard of care without approval of the board. It will name you in the narrative. It will\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t enjoin hope,\u201d I said. The line was too dramatic, and I hated myself for it. He sighed like I\u2019d missed an easy layup.\n\n\u201cYou can, in fact, enjoin acts,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can enjoin a person from taking steps dangerous to the public. And you can bury your reputation in papers so thick your wrists ache holding them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that you being afraid for me, Sloan?\u201d I asked, because one of us had to say his name and I wanted to be the one to move us out of formalities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s me being afraid for the town,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re stirring up, Barry. Meridian looks quiet until it isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAfter we hung up, I sat at my desk and looked at my hands again. You do it when you\u2019re nervous; you take inventory. A tiny burr of fabric clung to my knuckle. I pinched it off. Once, when I was a boy, a seam burst on my favorite bear. My mother took me gently by the wrist, sat me down at the kitchen table, and took out a needle. \u201cHold still,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep what\u2019s inside inside.\u201d\n\nMemory is cruel; it will hurl you face-first into a simple domestic scene and then shove you, suddenly, into a fluorescent hallway where everything smells like disinfectant and fear. I stood up. I went back to Saint Rose. People in scrubs were moving like lightning disguised as people.\n\nJoy took the antibiotic. She did not die. Her numbers slid toward normal the way a needle glides into a comfortable groove. Darla gripped my shoulder once, in the hall, so hard I saw stars, her fingers digging like she had found the little stiff patches of my coat and wanted to test them for structure. \u201cWe need to be careful,\u201d she whispered, and I nodded because I knew she meant more than medicine.\n\nWhen the story came out\u2014as of course it had to\u2014it came out not because I called a press conference, but because Meridian loves a secret so much it will run into the street and scream its lungs out to keep the pressure down. A cousin told an aunt who told a pastor who told a barber who told a speech therapist. By morning, the mailbox of my office had comments like confetti. People brought pies. People brought sharp questions. People brought the kind of low, ugly whispers a small place feeds on when it\u2019s hungry.\n\n\u201cYou think you found a cure?\u201d asked a man in a hardware store, leaning across the counter until he fogged the plexiglass with his breath. \u201cYou really think God likes you that much?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we learned something,\u201d I said, trying to be mild. He shoved a box of screws toward me harder than necessary, then smiled like we were friends again. I paid. I walked to my truck. The sun hit the hood so hard I thought it might melt me and pour me down into the street like syrup.\n\nIf I had known what was coming, would I have done it differently? I sometimes tell myself I would have kept to the shadows longer. But that\u2019s a lie. The second week, we found two more patients whose charts winked at Darla\u2019s hunch. The antibiotic\u2014ordinary, cheap\u2014paired with a generic cancer drug, was doing something unlicensed and gleeful in their blood. The third week, a nurse emailed me anonymously to say she believed her brother had the same markers. The email had typos and a little heart at the end, like she couldn\u2019t decide if she was being a scientist or a friend.\n\nThen the board suspended Darla\u2019s privileges.\n\nIt happened in a room with glass walls and a long table and a jug of water with lemon and mint leaves floating like drowned ornaments. I stood at one end, in a jacket that felt too new, the weave too obvious. Darla stood at the other end. The chairman of the board, a man named Olan McCreedy whose family owned half the banks and all the respect, neatly arranged his notes like he was dealing cards in a game he knew he would win.\n\n\u201cYou have put us in a difficult position, Doctor Kettering,\u201d he said. \u201cThis hospital cannot be a laboratory.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis town dies when we pretend it is not,\u201d she said, without heat. \u201cPeople die all the time while we protect our own.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re unrepentant,\u201d said McCreedy, softly, as if he were noting the weather.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m right,\u201d she said.\n\nThey voted. The motion carried. She lost her keys. She lost the access a doctor needs to do what she knows how to do.\n\nWhen we came outside, the sky had gone that bruised color it gets before a thunderstorm, yellowish at the edges, like an old book that\u2019s been thumbed too much. Darla laughed to keep her face from breaking.\n\n\u201cNow what?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNow you do what you do,\u201d she said. \u201cNow you file something.\u201d\n\nI did. I filed with anger and with care. I wrote so meticulously my fingers cramped and the pads of them felt hot. My sentences had sharp openings and easy landings. I filed asking the court to require the hospital to adopt as emergency protocol what we had seen in three patients in Meridian and another two at a clinic Darla had whispered to in Alabama. I pulled every string I knew. I wrote like a man who could sew with paper.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll come for you first,\u201d warned my friend Pil, who worked at the radio station and knew where the stories in town hid and how often they fed. \u201cIt\u2019ll be rough.\u201d\n\nHe was right. The merchants stopped smiling when I walked by. Letters to the editor spelled my name in creative ways. A cartoon appeared with my head on a bottle of snake oil. A man in a truck rolled down his window outside the courthouse and shouted, \u201cBarrett, you\u2019re a danger to people who love their families,\u201d and then, seeing my face, added in an embarrassed voice, \u201cNo offense.\u201d\n\nSloan filed his motion to enjoin. He wore a tie the color of money and a look like he had eaten something too rich and couldn\u2019t let himself burp because it would look common. In the hearing, he delivered his lines with ease. The judge liked him. The judge\u2019s grand-niece had married his cousin, and that counted for something even if we all pretended the court did not notice such little stitches connecting things.\n\n\u201cMr. Greaves is asking this court to do the opposite of what he claims,\u201d I told the judge when it was my turn. \u201cHe wants to turn the standard of care into a padlock, when it was meant to be a belt. He wants to strap us so tight we can\u2019t breathe. And my client\u201d\u2014I gestured toward Joy, who sat in the back row with a scarf on her head, smiling at something Darla had said under her breath\u2014\u201cjust wants to live a little more.\u201d\n\n\u201cCounsel,\u201d said the judge, half-exasperated, half-pleased at the theater. \u201cDo not manipulate the gallery.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of it,\u201d I said, and then I dreamt of it that night, very vividly.\n\nThe court delayed. The town talked. The newspaper could not decide if I was a savior or a salesman. A vigil appeared on the courthouse lawn, candles in paper cups glowing at the bases of the benches, notes tucked under stones with names written in earnest block letters. One morning, as if Meridian decided at last that my fate should be decided by a coin toss, the Post Office declared it would hold a forum for all \u201cinterested parties\u201d on \u201cthe issue of non-standard medical propaganda.\u201d The Post Office is where you go in Meridian to buy stamps, mail grievance, and announce your intention to serve society. We gathered there on a Wednesday between the hours of two and four, under fluorescent bulbs that hum in a way that makes your teeth feel slightly looser than you would prefer.\n\nSloan stood up first and spoke like a hymn. He had been captain of the debate team in high school and, it is said, dated the prettiest girl in the county for a while, long enough to make her parents believe he could be part of their lineage. He told us all about safety, about process, about law as a way to equalize luck and not the opposite. People nodded. He said the word \u201creckless\u201d like it was a personal insult to him, and three women made the same face at the same time in the front row, a kind of flinch you only get when you are frightened and attracted at once.\n\nWhen it was my turn, I began in a voice too soft for a room that size. It was all wrong. I could feel the thread slipping in my hands. Pil motioned from the back to project. Darla put her hands over her eyes for a second, then took them away like she was unseeing the person she saw me turning into. Joy sat next to her, and her smile never faltered, even when I fumbled the statistics, even when I said \u201cchromosome 7\u201d and then had to correct it to 17 and someone tittered like a child in church who had been told not to laugh.\n\n\u201cForgive me,\u201d I said finally, abandoning whatever script I had been trying to knit. \u201cI am not a scientist. I am a man who watched his mother\u2019s mouth go slack in a hospital and never quite recovered. I am someone who sees in the law not a glass shield but a mesh. It keeps out the big things and lets the air through. I want us to be able to breathe. Maybe you think I\u2019m the wrong person to ask you to trust this. Maybe I\u2019m the right one.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a great speech, but it was mine, and Meridian does have a fondness for authenticity, which it mistakes for art all the time. The room softened. People began to look at me like I was something alive and not just a cautionary tale.\n\n\u201cI know you,\u201d said a voice then, and I turned. An old man I\u2019d defended on a traffic ticket eight years ago stood up, his suspenders tight on his shoulders. \u201cYou kept me from losing my license. I drive my wife to church every Sunday. Don\u2019t let them tell you not to help folks. You help folks.\u201d\n\nThat was when Sloan did something he\u2019d never done in a public room before: he let his energy drop. He looked tired. He leaned against the wall like he couldn\u2019t quite feel his edges. He has a scar on his wrist most people don\u2019t notice; I noticed it now. He caught my eye and then, before anyone else could, he turned to the side, and I swear to you, he hummed\u2014just a fraction of a tune, aimless at first and then resolving, as if he were finding a melody.\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d said the Postmaster, because the clock on the wall had reached four and his power is absolute when it comes to closing time. \u201cNo more statements. We have heard our community.\u201d\n\nWe filed out. The sun had lowered and the heat felt less like a punishment and more like the tail end of some mercy. I looked for Darla. She had a habit of vanishing when she had to cry; I suspected she\u2019d stolen away to the alley to compose herself. Sloan came up beside me silently, so close I could smell the starch in his shirt and a faint, unexpected scent of cedar.\n\n\u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d he said. \u201cNot here.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo many witnesses?\u201d I asked, unable to resist.\n\n\u201cToo much noise,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s music under this we\u2019re not hearing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou going to sing it out for me?\u201d I said, and meant it as a joke. He didn\u2019t smile.\n\nHis office lives in a building that used to be a hat store. The ceiling is high and heavy and the light wired and old. He unlocked the door. Inside, it is quieter than any other place in Meridian, as if the building took its promise of secrecy seriously. He went to his desk and opened a drawer. He took out something I did not recognize at first\u2014sheet music. Blank measures printed lightly, and a pencil with a chewed-up eraser, and a small black metronome that ticked even when you didn\u2019t wind it if the air conditioner blew right on it.\n\n\u201cYou play?\u201d I said, surprised at how personal the question felt, and how sloppily it fell out of my mouth.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to write. We all have something we used to do, yes?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, thinking of how I used to sleep.\n\n\u201cMy father wanted me to win,\u201d he said. \u201cMusic isn\u2019t a winning thing in Meridian. It\u2019s a quiet thing. Quiet things get eaten.\u201d\n\nI waited for the but. It didn\u2019t arrive. He sat down, then stood immediately, then sat again like a man who had never learned what his body preferred. He looked at me carefully, as if reading notes on a page and trying to hear the chord.\n\n\u201cYou think you\u2019ve found a way to cure cancer,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think Darla did,\u201d I said. \u201cYou can call it an algorithm if you want. It\u2019s big and small at once. It\u2019s a combination of old things in a new way. It\u2019s sewing pieces that didn\u2019t look like they belonged.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, impatient at himself. He drummed his fingers once on the wooden desk.\n\n\u201cI can let you keep going,\u201d he said. \u201cOr I can stop you cold.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d I began, but he raised his hand.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do either alone,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not the judge. But I can orchestrate. I can make the song that plays in the judge\u2019s ear or the board\u2019s ear. You know this. You resent it.\u201d He closed his eyes for a moment and said, almost too softly to hear, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be that man anymore.\u201d\n\nIt was my turn to be silent. He kept his eyes closed like a person about to leap.\n\n\u201cI wake up,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd all I see are measures. Four by four. Six by eight. Things that can hold sound. But I put words in them instead of notes, and they cut people. I\u2019m tired, Barrett. My son\u2014did you know I had a son?\u2014he sits on the carpet and bangs on a toy piano with his palms and shrieks with joy, real joy, not the kind our Joy plays at for our sakes, and I think, why would I not want to be as close to that as possible with whatever time I get.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d I asked, and hated how hungry I sounded.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m moving.\u201d\n\nHe looked scared of the confession. He looked like the first time I\u2019d seen one of Joy\u2019s numbers move toward the unthinkable. Beautiful. Dangerous. I should have said something. Thank you, perhaps. Or I\u2019m sorry. Or Let me help. Instead, I stared stupidly at the pencil and the metronome and at his hands, wondering at the long, narrow fingers, the nails unbelievably neat, the cuticles trimmed just so, the ridges like the faintest stitched line from thumb to forefinger where the skin should be thicker and is not.\n\n\u201cMy wife says it\u2019s a midlife crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cI told her crises are for the young. The old have transformations.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not old,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI feel very old,\u201d he said. He smiled then, finally, a smile that felt like something unpinned inside him and fell to the floor softly. \u201cI don\u2019t expect you to forgive me for everything I\u2019ve done. But I want you to hear one more thing. There are people in this town with a stake you have not yet met. Men whose shirts smell like warehouses and the inside of new cars. They like things the way they are. They like their stories quiet, and their little risks compartmentalized and their dividends predictable. They will hurt you. I don\u2019t know how. They\u2019ll figure out a way that doesn\u2019t look unseemly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, truly. The words landed between us like a square of fabric, and we both looked at it like we were trying to decide what to make out of it.\n\nI left his office and the evening felt more like a corridor than a sky. The whole town a hallway, the streetlights little stitches tacked along the edges. My phone vibrated. A text from Darla: they had tapped her home phone, she thought, because someone had called asking specific questions about Tinsley\u2019s dosage; she had called the number back and got only a recorded voice. I told her to come to my office. I told her to bring Joy if she could.\n\nThey came together, mother and daughter and doctor and fear, and we sat in my conference room with the ceiling fan clicking slightly on one blade\u2014click at each turn, click like a metronome misaligned. Joy fell asleep in the chair with her hands folded in her lap, palms up, fingers loose like she was holding air.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to do this,\u201d Darla said, a confession so childlike I loved her for it. \u201cIt\u2019s like I was taught one story and then, mid-way, someone told me there was a better plot and I had to begin again without losing my place.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing it,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s how it feels.\u201d\n\nShe nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking to a lab in Jackson that can culture the cell lines and run this faster. If we move it out of Meridian for the beat, it\u2019s less\u2014visible.\u201d She said the word like it was damp cloth. \u201cWe might lose equity.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing about this is equitable,\u201d I said.\n\nWe were quiet. The town hummed around us, a thing with a thousand stitched mouths. Outside, a train passed, its horn drawn out and slow. Joy stirred and murmured something I didn\u2019t catch, then slept deeper, her head falling to the side, an angle that would have hurt me; she looked comfortable.\n\nI admired her scarf. It was a pattern of little gold stars and something else I could not name. I went closer and then felt rude and stepped back. I have a terrible urge to touch fabric when I see it, to feel the grain, to note the thickness. My mother could tell, even on days when I swore I was being discreet. \u201cHands that crave cloth,\u201d she would tease, her needle flashing in the kitchen lamplight. \u201cYou\u2019ll be a tailor.\u201d I became a lawyer. Which is a kind of tailor. My suits have always been a fraction too sharp at the shoulders, so I remember they\u2019re on my body.\n\nAt midnight, after they\u2019d gone, I stood in the doorway of my office and listened to the cicadas perform their simple, arrogant symphony. I thought of Sloan at his desk with an empty staff and a pencil, of the DA\u2019s office, of his reputation like a gold frame around a painting that might be empty. I thought of men in rooms with glass walls, their voices smooth as oiled wood. I thought of my mother\u2019s hands. The world was a garment and somebody had to do the repairs.\n\nOn my walk home, the streetlights haloed in the wet air, I passed E.J.\u2019s 24-hour and saw, through the window, a little boy hugging a bear so worn its fur was almost matte, its plush flattened into a dense patience. I stopped. I don\u2019t know why. The boy pressed his nose into the bear\u2019s head, and his eyes closed, and his small mouth made a shape that was not quite a smile and not quite a prayer.\n\nI went to sleep with my phone on the pillow, a thing I advise none of my clients to do. Around three in the morning, I woke with a start, certain someone had said my name. Only the air conditioner. Only the fans spinning, threads of air in a dark room. I got up, walked to the kitchen, poured water with an unsteady hand. I caught sight of myself in the reflection of the window. Even in the smudged glass, I could see exhaustion had tucked itself into the corners of my eyes. I rubbed them and felt a small roughness under the skin, like felt. I startled, hissed, laughed at myself. Weirdness visits at three a.m. like a cat that knows which house will get up to feed it.\n\nIn the morning there was an envelope under my door. No stamp. Thick, off-white, like a formal invitation had been repurposed for something less charming. Inside, a single page: if you do not stop we will open you. The letters were cut from a magazine from the seventies or maybe someone with a sense of theater had sought such. I ran my thumb along the edge of the paper and got a sensation like you get when you snag on a tag and it pulls where there is no skin to pull. It was a good threat. Efficient. The grinning cruelty of a child with scissors.\n\nI brought Darla the note. I brought Sloan an image of it. I brought my fear to the mirror and looked at it until it looked back like an old friend. Then I put on my jacket and stood straight in it, and I drove to see Joy with a bouquet of something not too sweet, daises maybe, because lilies have too much funeral in them and roses are for apologies we cannot afford.\n\n\u201cYou always bring the wrong flowers,\u201d Joy teased when I knocked, and I felt myself turn into the person Meridian claimed I was. \u201cIt\u2019s OK. I like wrong.\u201d\n\nOn the way back to the truck, a man leaned against the hood and smiled into my face. His teeth were too straight; his shirt had a sheen to it I recognized from catalogues where the fabric is described with untrue, hopeful adjectives. Behind him stood two other men, their hands folded neatly in front as if they had been practicing docility and could turn it off if asked. The smiling man tapped my fender lightly with his knuckles, a gesture that says, We know how to make noise, and also, We can be quiet.\n\n\u201cWe like order,\u201d he said without introducing himself. \u201cWe like it when doctors wait their turn. We like it when lawyers do not make themselves prophets. You should go on a vacation, Barry\u2014I can call you Barry, right?\u2014and when you return, this will all be over, one way or another.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeridian is the size of a hand,\u201d I said, before I could stop myself. \u201cYou can\u2019t take a vacation from your own fingers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can cut them off,\u201d he said pleasantly, and his friends laughed as if he\u2019d told a droll joke in the car ride over and they were delighted to hear it again. \u201cDon\u2019t bring the DA into this. He\u2019s going through something delicate and musical.\u201d\n\nThe way he said musical held contempt and disbelief and a pinch of curiosity, like music was a rumor he couldn\u2019t quite squash. The three men stepped away in unison, like a little dance. They left without saying good-bye, and I stood there in the sun, my shadow a piece of punctuation on the pavement, wondering if I had time to become a better sort of brave.\n\nThat night, Sloan called me and didn\u2019t speak for ten seconds. Then, faintly, like he was in another house and didn\u2019t want to wake anyone, he said, \u201cI wrote something.\u201d\n\n\u201cA brief?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cA song,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not good yet. But it moved air in the room. I thought you should know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d I said, and I did not know whether I meant I was glad for him, for me, or for the air.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the town will try to close us. There are ways to stay open. I\u2019m learning them. They\u2019re not in the books.\u201d\n\nBefore I could answer, he hung up. I sat there with the phone pulling heat from my palm, amazed at the sudden, wrong-turn feeling of it all, at how the map now included places we had pretended were not in our county. My chest ached with a small, familiar pain. I pressed my fist against it and felt my body complain. At the table, the stack of pleadings I\u2019d planned to finish had slipped slightly, the edges misaligned. I straightened them, glided my palm over until they clicked into a perfect rectangle, then left them crooked on purpose. It looked like life.\n\nIn the morning, a letter from a small clinic in Jackson sat waiting in my email. They wanted to see our data. They wanted to try the protocol. They had found two patients with fourteen matching markers. They sent me a spreadsheet so beautifully arranged I felt a childish wish to touch it, to smooth it as if smoothing could carry over to the cells in those bodies. I wrote back yes. I wrote back we are with you. I wrote back Sorry for any delay in my response, I was standing in the kitchen trying to figure out if bravery is a pantry item you can run out of.\n\nOn the refrigerator, a magnet held a photograph of my mother next to me at a fair, both of us sticky with candy, her hand on my head like she wanted to be sure it was still there. The edge of the photo had begun to curl. I pressed it flat. \u201cWe\u2019re doing it,\u201d I told her. On the street outside, a truck downshifted with a noise like ripping. The day rose around us, all the unseen fastenings doing their quiet work.",

It had rained in the night\u2014hard, vertical rain that made the magnolia leaves shine like they\u2019d been lacquered by a feverish artisan\u2014and now everything looked scrubbed, as if the town had been reminded it has a face and decided to wash. I shaved and nicked myself because my hand wandered thinking of other kinds of edges, then pressed toilet paper to the dot of blood like a man attempting first aid on a painting. In the window, the reflection of my jawline went in and out with the clouds. I wanted to call someone about how beautiful it all was and then remembered beauty only makes sense to people who already share your ridiculous faith in it.\n\nPil called first anyway, and he never bothered with preambles unless he wanted something big. He spoke in a whisper because his station manager, whom he did not respect but did not wish to offend, believed whispers signaled important news and Pil liked to make him feel included. He said the Jackson clinic wanted me on-air to talk about \u201ccommunity-sourced innovation,\u201d which is a phrase I distrust and a concept I was beginning to live inside of whether or not I liked what the walls were made of. I told him no, then yes, then I said give me an hour and I\u2019d drive over to Saint Rose to see Joy first and he could catch me on the way back if the station\u2019s personas required me to sound like I hadn\u2019t rehearsed.\n\n\u201cSay less science,\u201d Pil advised, and then coughed. \u201cSay more mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe town already knows mine better than I do,\u201d I said, but he was right and we both knew it. He makes a decent living reminding people of the stories they already repeated to themselves before bed.\n\nDarla met me at the back entrance because her badge no longer opened the side doors and she refused to be escorted by a guard who used to bring her cupcakes from his wife on Fridays. She wore her white coat over a blue dress that was too nice for what it would see that day, and she\u2019d pinned her hair back tight, the kind of aggressive practicality women are forced to choose when they\u2019re worried a wrong curl will be mistaken for frivolity. She kissed me on the cheek without warning, the quick brush of someone who has forgotten certain proprieties in favor of others, and then apologized as if the law forbade affection between co-conspirators.\n\n\u201cI slept for an hour and a half,\u201d she said cheerfully, which is how the bravest people I know tell you they are very, very tired. \u201cJoy\u2019s numbers stayed\u2014\u201d She stopped herself from saying good. Superstition expands to fit any space it\u2019s offered. \u201cThey stayed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour home phone?\u201d I asked, and she nodded, her mouth flattening.\n\n\u201cTapped, or else I\u2019ve learned to be paranoid late. Doesn\u2019t matter. We move anyway,\u201d she said. \u201cI talked to Dr. Carrow at Jackson. She\u2019s got a room. She will not put us on paper until she sees it with her own eyes, and I respect her for that and I hate it because my patience is a thimble, not a bowl.\u201d\n\n\u201cDr. Carrow,\u201d I repeated, liking the shape of the name, the way it sounded like something that carried you. \u201cShe the kind to share credit?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the kind who doesn\u2019t notice credit until she stumbles over it and bruises,\u201d Darla said. \u201cI envy people like that. My envy is not large. It\u2019s a tidy thing.\u201d\n\nWe laughed because we had to. In Joy\u2019s room, light splayed itself on the floor as if wanting to nap. She had a book open face-down on her stomach like a small, sunning animal, and when she woke to see us it was with that unstartled blink only children and monks have mastered. Her scarf today had tiny birds stitched along the edge, each one bent toward the same direction, as if obeying a wind their cloth could remember.\n\n\u201cYou look like trouble,\u201d she told me, and I bowed slightly, because the only compliment I have ever been any good at accepting is that I am likely to make a mess.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re driving to Jackson, not to run away but to be seen,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you think your parents can be convinced to let you nap in a moving car without believing that\u2019s a metaphor for death?\u201d\n\nShe grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who talks about metaphors. They talk about how far it is and whether we have to stop to pee. I have charts in my head. They have distances in miles.\u201d\n\nEarl and his wife arrived with a tote bag that had been a tote for bread at one time\u2014you could tell by the faint scent no laundering could erase\u2014and we loaded the car like we were going to the beach and not to a place where people watch numbers like hawks. Darla got behind the wheel, which surprised me and then did not, because she hates being a passenger whenever the road feels like a sentence you can finish with a good verb.\n\nThe highway between Meridian and Jackson goes past the kind of fields you think are empty until you look and see the low muscles of creatures moving through them. Kudzu tries to take whole trees into its mouth and fails prettily. Pil called once, then again, and I told him to put me on live because if I had time to think I would stop breathing. He introduced me with a song, some throwback soul number that made my ribs loosen, and said, \u201cMeridian, you know this man, and if you don\u2019t, you will, and he will make you mad and he will make you proud, and then you\u2019ll want to feed him casseroles, which he accepts in tinfoil only because he trusts no one to return a Pyrex unchipped.\u201d\n\nIt is possible to love a friend for how well he lies on your behalf. I talked for three minutes with my voice pitched low. I avoided numbers. I told a story about watching my mother fall asleep mid-needle, the thread half-pulled through the fabric, and how when I woke she had gotten up quietly and finished the seam so that in the morning the quilt looked inevitable, and how inevitability is just the name we give to stubborn kindness. The switchboard lit red, Pil later told me, with people who felt either blessed or betrayed by me, and which one you feel has a lot to do with what you ate for breakfast, or how close you\u2019ve been standing to machines that hiss.\n\nIn Jackson, the hospital does not pretend to be anything but what it is: a space where bodies are counted against their wishes. Dr. Carrow had hair the color of a penny left on the sill for exactly one winter and eyes that didn\u2019t scan the way doctors\u2019 eyes sometimes do when they\u2019re collecting you for later. She took Joy\u2019s hand, and the way she held it without squeezing made me want to propose to her on Darla\u2019s behalf. In the lab, the air had that metallic chill that suggests the thermometer is the one person in the room whose taste matters. Carrow walked us past things that hummed and shone with their own certainty.\n\n\u201cMarkers match,\u201d she said, using the flat voice of someone who has learned that good news, spoken with too much warmth, will be punished by a bad god. \u201cWe\u2019ll draw and we\u2019ll start. I\u2019m going to call this an observation. It will not be nothing. You will try to understand that this very careful scene we are acting in is also theater.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is theater,\u201d I said, then winced because I had stolen a line from an undergraduate course I once took and barely passed.\n\nIn the room where they would hang the drug and the not-a-drug, Darla stood in the corner like she was bad at being told to be anywhere but the middle. Joy looked at us and then looked up and said, \u201cWill my hair come back different,\u201d which was not the question any of us expected and all of us cherished.\n\n\u201cIt often does,\u201d Carrow said. \u201cSometimes curlier. Sometimes like it won a small argument about itself. My friend\u2019s came back with a stupid cowlick and she says the cowlick makes her brave because it refuses to obey even when prudence suggests otherwise.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen good,\u201d said Joy, and closed her eyes like a girl folding herself up, then opening on cue.\n\nWe were there for an hour before Meridian decided it could not bear to be only a place in our rearview mirror and called anyway. The board had drafted a letter to the state health department requesting an investigation into \u201cirregularities of care.\u201d They had copied Sloan, who called me not to gloat and not to warn, but to say a sentence without verbs. \u201cThey touched the wrong door,\u201d he said, and I heard the exhausted gladness of a man who has finally decided to put down a heavy object he had been carrying because his father told him it made him taller.\n\n\u201cWhat door?\u201d I asked, not because I didn\u2019t know, but to make him say it aloud.\n\n\u201cOversight,\u201d he said. \u201cYou said it at the forum. They took the word standard and tried to turn it into something sharp. The administrator at the department? She lost her sister at twenty-six because a hospital waited. They have done themselves an injury and I cannot politely point it out, so I am calling you so you will hit it with a hammer.\u201d\n\nI thanked him, and then didn\u2019t, because we\u2019d become the kind of people with a ledger of compliments we owed and we were never going to settle the account in full. Carrow poked her head in, and Darla\u2019s face loosened into a precise joy I have seen on very particular days\u2014weddings that were not mistakes, verdicts that undid a year of someone else\u2019s cruelty, mornings when rain holds off just long enough for a funeral with folding chairs.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d she said, and I did, and there it was: a graph writing a story it had refused to tell all those who came to listen before.\n\nI did not cry because I am bad at crying when other people are brave. I reserve my tears for laundry rooms and for the exact moment I trip over a low shoe I placed in the hallway myself. Earl made a noise like the lowest note on a fat wooden instrument, and his wife pressed both her hands to her scarf with the oranges, then did a little bounce that would have been mistaken for silly in another room but was exactly right in this one. I thought of my mother\u2019s hand on the back of my neck when I slept and woke to find nap marks on my face that she never mentioned except with a smile.\n\nOn the drive back, Meridian looked darker, either because a storm thought about arriving and declined like a guest with an excuse, or because my eyes had grown tired with all the looking. We took the road that skirts a junkyard I have always loved for its honesty. Cars sit there with their mouths open, waiting to be cannibalized, their wires like veins. Somebody had strung a piece of fabric across the chain-link fence, a flag with no nation, and it flapped with the kind of conviction you admire in fools.\n\nThe office smelled faintly of lemon because my secretary, Aimee, cleans her countertop when she is anxious, and the smell lifts through our cheap vents like republics do, unevenly, catching in the pockets and making them lemon-er than their neighbors. There was a box on my chair labeled with my name in a handwriting I did not recognize but felt I ought to. I picked it up the way you pick up a child who does not yet trust you and may kick.\n\nInside lay a teddy bear, not new. The fur was rubbed in patches the way fur gets rubbed when it has done its duty protecting a small person from loud clocks and grown-up laughter. A seam ran along its belly, and the seam had been cut open cleanly\u2014no raggedness, no haste\u2014and then tugged apart, leaving its stuffing slightly visible, a little throat on the wrong part of a body. There was a note tucked so carefully under the arm that I had to admire the hand that placed it even while wishing the hand belonged in a trap.\n\nDo you keep what\u2019s inside inside? it asked, without capitalization, without punctuation, as if those were luxuries we could dispense with now. A lumpy stitch closed the rest of the page, a child\u2019s performance of mending written in thread. I put my fingers into the bear\u2019s belly, then stopped because I am not the man who does that, and then did it anyway because maybe I am. Inside, someone had tucked a single business card. The card smelled faintly of smoke, and the name on it belonged to a warehouse company out by the highway, one that services hospitals, one owned, as it happened, by a McCreedy cousin whose wedding, I remembered, I had once attended in a suit that did not quite fit because Aimee had convinced me the photograph would live forever.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re bold,\u201d Aimee said quietly, having watched my face do what it does. \u201cThey want to be credited for the threat. That\u2019s the part that\u2019s always seemed strangest to me about this place. People sin and then they monogram it.\u201d\n\nShe and I boxed the bear back up, then took it out, then boxed it again. I called Sloan and told him I would be sending a copy of the card to someone who would know what to do with it, and he said to use an envelope without a return address because theatre had to be played in all directions for this one to land. I told him he was becoming exhausting in his good advice and he said, softly, almost laughing, \u201cYou make me brave. I forgot how to be embarrassed when I stopped making music.\u201d\n\nThat afternoon, we had our first home visit request from someone who lived an hour past where the maps give up. The email contained its own accent. It asked us to come look at a man named Buckley who had grown up with so many sisters he never learned to keep his elbows to himself and had recently been taught the limits of bone. The markers, scribbled numerically as if from memory, matched too closely to be coincidence. Darla read the note and then set her jaw and looked at me like an artist finds a subject by accident and must pretend it was an intention all along.\n\n\u201cIf they take my keys, I bring my hands,\u201d she said, and packed a bag like a midwife.\n\nWe drove at dusk, the sky a bruise, the road stitching fields to one another with a line so straight it felt like a dare. Buckley\u2019s house had three chairs on a porch even though there were six residents, which told me a lot about their fights. Inside, the air held a mixture of onions and oil and something sweet. He lay on the couch, not pretending the couch did not shame him by being a couch and not a bed. His sisters were younger, all of them with long hair they obviously took turns combing. Everything in that room had been touched too many times and was not ashamed of it.\n\nHe watched Darla with a distrust so pure it was almost a kind of honesty I wished I could bottle and give to every judge I\u2019d ever stood before. She asked what she should ask, then asked what none of us ever ask because we pretend bodies are the only site of pain. \u201cWho told you you weren\u2019t allowed to be scared,\u201d she said. He cried like a man learning a word in a language he pretended he didn\u2019t want to speak.\n\nI stood in the doorway like furniture. I looked at the curtains, which were made of a fabric I recognized from the chain-store in town that sells everything and nothing at a price that makes you feel complicit. The hem had been taken up with a contrasting thread, a quick job done by a hand that assumed no one would be rude enough to notice. I noticed, and loved whoever had done it for refusing to apologize for haste. We left a cooler with things that will never be cooler enough for anyone who has had to use one to hold medicine. As we drove away, a dog chased the car for the first ten feet and then remembered his other duty, which was to sit on the porch and guard the chairs.\n\nThe letter from the state came the next morning, and I understood immediately what Sloan had meant about the wrong door. It was written in the unadorned tone of people who have been taught, usually by loss, that adornment should be rationed. It asked the board to explain, in writing, why its waiver process required three months even when a physician\u2019s request included language about imminent decline. It asked for dates. It asked for copies of donor agreements in which practices were \u201csuggested,\u201d a word that can mean a lot if you were raised to hear nuance, and can mean nothing if you live in a house where nuance is a cousin nobody invites because he never brings a dish. I took the letter to McCreedy\u2019s office myself, because I wanted to see his face absorb it, and because I am, at heart, childish enough to enjoy a legal delivery that feels like a dessert hurled low across a long table.\n\nThe receptionist, whose nails were a miracle of patience and tiny art, asked if I had an appointment. I smiled and said I had a public document with a private effect. She looked at me the way women look at men who enjoy awakening the appetite of the room for drama, and then buzzed me through. McCreedy stood with his back to the window, a tall man whose suits always fit like a hand-laundered shirt on a child. His hair was the color of money and he used gel the way some men use prayer. He took the letter, smiled to show he knew what was in it, then let the smile slip to show me it could slip when he wanted.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re making a mess, Barry,\u201d he said pleasantly. \u201cThis town likes tidiness. I\u2019m trying to protect your career from your convictions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to protect your convictions from your career,\u201d I said, and he laughed because the line was too good to ignore, even for someone who prefers a dull sentence to a smart blade any day. He tapped the corner of the letter against his desk and then set it down as if the page might bruise. When he looked at me again, I saw the calculation men like him cannot resist. Am I the thing to be bent, he was wondering, or do I carry my own metal.\n\nWhen men decide to harm you in Meridian, they call your mother\u2019s pastor and ask him to pray for you out loud on a Sunday for a thing you did not do. If your mother is dead, they call the pastor anyway, because they prefer their weapons consecrated. The next weekend, a friend sent me a clip from a service in which the pastor called down wisdom on those \u201cwho are lured by the lights of arrogant science and forget to be small,\u201d and while I do not name myself a Christian anymore, I know a parable when I hear one and I know a cudgel when I am struck with it. After church, at the grocery, two women I\u2019d known since grade school turned their heads at the exact same angle so their hair made a curtain and their mouths could work in that quick, righteous way. The aisle with the canned beans has never felt so long.\n\nSloan, who has spent his whole life in rooms where other people pretend not to move the furniture while you are seated on it, called me and did not say I told you so. \u201cI am finding that when I hum while I write a brief, my sentences relax,\u201d he told me instead, as if reporting a symptom. \u201cMy assistant thinks I have lost my mind. The mind that did that work deserved to be lost. I\u2019m beginning a motion with a story. Do you believe me? I am terrified.\u201d\n\n\u201cTerroir makes better arguments,\u201d I said, because I read that somewhere and wanted it to be true about everything.\n\nHe hummed on the line without meaning to, and I pictured his mouth, which had never entertained much softness, shaping around the note. \u201cThey will file a bar complaint,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should know. There is a woman whose business it is to write such things for people who cannot bring themselves to say them aloud. She wrote mine when I prosecuted the wrong boy a lifetime ago, and I will never use her again, because she made me excellent and I hated it. She is on retainer to the warehouse people. I don\u2019t want you surprised.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like being surprised,\u201d I lied, because some lies are less about the truth and more about practicing a posture. He hung up and I put the phone on the kitchen counter and pressed my palms into the laminate until the cheap pattern printed itself on my skin. When I lifted my hands, the pale ovals faded fast, which felt like an omen I chose not to interpret.\n\nJoy texted me a photo of her lab sheet with a single number circled and a row of confetti emojis she would not have deigned to use two months ago. \u201cI feel like I swallowed the right seed,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMaybe it will sprout an ugly flower and I won\u2019t care.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlant anything,\u201d I wrote back. \u201cEven weeds have the decency to try.\u201d\n\nThat night, I dreamt the courthouse steps were made of fabric and each time I took a step my foot sank an inch and a needle poked up from the next rung to tell me, with a sting, to be careful. When I woke, my chest hurt the way it does in the dreams where you run too fast in one direction and realize the floor has tilted. I made coffee that tasted like grief then tried again and made coffee that tasted like medium resolve. The mail came with an envelope that had the weight of a menacing invitation. The bar complaint alleged that I had advised a physician to prescribe outside of protocol for personal gain and had \u201cmarketed claims of miracle\u201d to the detriment of an unnamed population. It cited the radio appearance Pil had insisted on. It cited a sentence from an online article at a site everyone knows and no one admits to reading, which had called me \u201cmercurial and emotional,\u201d both of which are true and neither of which is illegal.\n\nI took the complaint to the one person in town besides me who keeps file folders alphabetized but not color-coded because color-coding, she says, is a religion she refuses to practice. Mrs. Hale has been practicing law since before I could pronounce tort properly, and she smells like cedar and the inside of library books that have been stored well. She read it with her eyebrows lifting at regular intervals and then she put her finger on my name at the top as if to anchor me and said, \u201cThey don\u2019t know how you learned to sew. They think you only learned to rip. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of being fine,\u201d I said. \u201cI want to be loud and right and forgiven.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can pick two,\u201d she said crisply, then softened. \u201cIt feels bigger because it is. It\u2019s bigger because we haven\u2019t done this before and you are arrogant enough to pretend you know how. Thank God for arrogance, sometimes. It keeps us out of trouble and it drags us toward the places trouble turned into a map.\u201d\n\nOn the day of the administrative hearing, Meridian chose humidity as a weapon. The room had a fan but it clicked, and the clerk, out of loyalty to silence, turned it off while we spoke. The panel sat in their chairs as if the chairs were electric and would shock them if they leaned too far in any direction. Sloan stood and, true to his word, began with a story about a boy who hummed while he did his homework and got hit with a ruler because humming has no place in math. He said he had spent his career learning to do the kind of work that makes humming illegal and he was here to ask to reverse a very small law in a very small place.\n\n\u201cWe are not asking to change the way medicine is practiced in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are asking to make room for a thing that is happening while we speak. I have seen the numbers. I have seen the faces behind them. They look like the people who attended my wedding and the people who avoided it. They look like this town.\u201d\n\nThe warehouse men sat in the back, their shirts gleaming absurdly. One of them had a pinky ring that caught the lights whenever he shifted his hand, and I had a childish fantasy of stealing it and dropping it into a glass of water to watch it fizz. Darla spoke next, and she was as precise as I have ever heard anyone be. She used phrases that made the panel blink because their cadence belonged to rooms where people speak quietly so sorrow does not run too fast. She said off-label as if labeling were a superstition and not a comfort. She said adverse event and the room\u2019s very few children, dragged there because their babysitters fell through, turned their faces because they recognize the tone adults use when they want to say death but cannot.\n\nWhen it was my turn, I did not make it about my mother. I wanted to, because my heart is a noisy snob. I spoke instead about the plainest part of the law: its decent wish to give a person not a past but a future. I said the phrase \u201creasonable choice\u201d twice and only knocked my knuckle against the table once, by accident, which counts as progress for a man like me. At the edge of the room, a woman whose sister had been Joy\u2019s nurse for three months started to cry openly, and no one told her to leave, and that felt like we had done one thing right whether or not we won what was on the paper.\n\nWe did not win. Of course we did not. The panel deferred, which is a kind of slap you deliver with a silk glove when you don\u2019t want to bruise the hand but do want to remind it who owns the glove. We filed out into a heat so generous even enemies felt briefly bonded by it. One of the warehouse men brushed past me and said, his voice like candy dropped in a church pew, \u201cWe needed to see if you frighten easy. You do not. That is inconvenient for us.\u201d He smiled and added, almost regretful, \u201cWe will have to be creative. Creativity is not what we pay for.\u201d\n\nThat night Darla called at eleven to say Joy\u2019s temperature had spiked. There are words that cut through a phone line and rearrange the furniture in your chest. Spike is one. I put on shoes without socks and drove too fast and did not apologize to the two yellow lights I made deals with. Joy\u2019s face burned and her eyes were so clear they looked like someone had polished them to sell them in a store. Carrow had sent instructions and a dose and a warning, and we followed all three as if we were learning a dance with music we considered personal. The room smelled like water. Earl stood in the doorway as if the door had hired him to be the respectable face of alarm.\n\nThe fever broke at three the way thin ice breaks under a foot that deserves to be forgiven for the trouble it causes. Her hair plastered to her head and she looked like a girl again and not like a saint, which I prefer because saints are exhausting and girls are what the world is made for. Darla sat on the floor because chairs had become untrustworthy. She rested her head against the cabinet and laughed into her own shoulder, which is the kind of laugh you do when you\u2019re afraid other people will misunderstand happiness if you let it out loose.\n\nWe went outside because the room had been too much a body. The air had that fresh metallic thing again, and I know it is only the smell of wet concrete and the way the night plays tricks but I will call it mercy. Sloan sent a text with a photo of a sheet of music with four measures filled, pencil dark at the edges like he had pressed too hard because the day had asked too much. Underneath, he wrote, \u201cI moved air again,\u201d and I wrote back as carefully as I could, \u201cYou are allowed.\u201d\n\nAs we stood there, a small truck rolled slowly down the street and then slowed more, then stopped. This is a town where stopping is not suspicious until it is. The window rolled down and the man whose teeth were too straight leaned out and said almost sorrowfully, \u201cYou keep choosing the loudest form of your courage. We prefer the quiet kind.\u201d He took a picture of us in the street with a sound that made me think of a zipper, then drove on as gently as he had arrived, and for a second we looked down at our bodies to see if the photograph had removed anything visible.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of their good grammar,\u201d Darla said, and went back inside to watch her patient breathe. I stood there and marveled, the way I have since boyhood, at how very little holds anything where it is, how much of what keeps a town from falling down is the habit of shoes on the same boards and the way we know how to turn a corner without falling apart. My phone buzzed. The state administrator wanted to meet in person in Jackson to talk about a pilot program they might not be allowed to call a pilot program. She\u2019d be on the steps at noon with a folder that looked like any other folder and would contain an invitation she could not hand me without pretending it was a reprimand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring a reprimand folder of my own,\u201d I wrote back, because there are games even I enjoy playing.\n\nI went home and sat in my kitchen and looked at my hands. The crease between thumb and forefinger had a tiny nick in it, right where fast things catch you, and when I flexed my fingers the cut stretched and threatened to split. I sucked on it without thinking, a child\u2019s cure, and tasted faint iron. In the other room, my mother\u2019s quilt hung over the back of a chair, the light catching on the places where her stitches are tighter because my father had left that week and you can see it if you know how to read such things. I ran my fingers over one row and then the next, feeling the bumps like Braille, as if the fabric might tell me what to do next, as if she had hidden directions there, as if the whole world were a garment and somebody had, at last, handed me a needle I knew how to hold.",

On the steps in Jackson, she stood with a folder so plain it broadcast its own decency, chin lifted not in pride but in habit. Her name was Lorraine Keys, which felt right because you could hear how often she had opened things and how little she had been thanked for it. She extended the folder as if she might be seen on a Baptist postcard doing a similar act with a casserole, and then she smiled in a way that let me know how deeply she had practiced believing polite forms could hold impolite truths until those truths learned to sit up straight.\n\n\u201cMr. Barrett,\u201d she said, and her voice had the grain of someone who had trained it to move through rooms full of men without knocking china. \u201cThis is a reprimand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI adore reprimands,\u201d I said softly. \u201cThey go with all my suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cInside,\u201d she continued, not indulging my bad habit, \u201cyou\u2019ll find a letter asking Saint Rose to clarify its waiver process, a draft schedule for a site visit by my office, and two pages that we\u2019re not supposed to have written yet because they belong to an initiative without a budget or a blessing. We will call it a study for as long as that makes anyone feel safer. Between us, it is a pilot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew I liked you,\u201d I said, and she tilted her head a fraction, fighting the smile that wants to run ahead of a woman\u2019s work and take credit. She pointed to a bench and we sat like strangers about to trade recipes.\n\n\u201cI lost my sister at twenty-six,\u201d Lorraine said plainly, and the sentence walked itself into my body without asking for permission. \u201cThey said there was nothing to be done and then, three years later, there was something to be done and the town that got it first had better handwriting and a man with a lake house. I put a dent in my desk the week I learned that. The dent is still there, and I run my fingers over it when I\u2019m deciding who I\u2019m angry at.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am here to be useful to your anger,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd to your restraint.\u201d\n\nShe nodded. \u201cGood. Because we will need both. I can\u2019t protect you from donors. I can shelter a protocol if we are tidy and if we do not insist the applause precede the work. I will need data that doesn\u2019t look like greed. I will need, especially, a physician who prefers bone-marrow honesty to applause.\u201d\n\n\u201cDarla,\u201d I said. \u201cShe runs on that.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Lorraine said again. \u201cShe will sit on a committee that does not yet exist. You will not. I know your type. Your talent is for throwing open windows and then holding them against a storm. In governance, that makes the papers warp. I mean that kindly.\u201d\n\n\u201cKind is the word I live for,\u201d I said, which is true and feels cheap every time I say it. She tapped the folder and looked out over the parking lot as if it were a plainsong she had memorized and couldn\u2019t stop humming.\n\n\u201cThey will come at supply,\u201d she said without drama. \u201cYou do not need to know how I know. You need only to plan for it. If your town is held together by warehouse men, those men understand that the easiest way to make a doctor behave is to make her wait on a truck. They will not make the drug vanish. They will make the paperwork multiply until you believe it is a forest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know a man who is learning to cut paths,\u201d I said, and thought of Sloan\u2019s mouth shaping notes, his fingers tapping time against his desk. \u201cHe will not like being told where to walk.\u201d\n\nLorraine stood with that briskness women in flats learn so no one thinks their shoes make them slow. \u201cUse the letter. Do not quote me. When they tell you you\u2019re arrogant, try not to prove them right while understanding they will call you arrogant either way. Bring me numbers. Bring me faces only when you must. My staff has very good hearts and poor circulation in their faces; they cannot hear mothers without weeping and it embarrasses them and then they do dumb things with policy.\u201d\n\nShe left with the humility of someone who has learned the cost of being looked at, and I sat on the warm stone and read the reprimand with a hungry pleasure. It was written in the kind of English that believes verbs should be tools: ask, clarify, explain. At the back of the packet, two untitled pages laid out a plain miracle: a registry with teeth, emergency waivers at the department level when boards stalled, and a line reserving a chair for a \u201cpracticing oncologist from an affected community\u201d that had Darla\u2019s shape all over it. I folded the papers small and tucked them where I would not lose them, inside the lining of my jacket in the down-left pocket my tailor had installed because he did not trust me to keep anything precious where it could be reached in a hurry.\n\nOn the drive back, the radio offered a gospel station that bleeds into the frequency Pil uses when storms fret with our towers. A choir lifted a chord so clean I wanted to pull over and iron my day. The tilt of the sun made the magnolia leaves look like coins flipping in the air and coming up the side that feeds you. At a light, a farmer in a truck as old as my regrets glanced over and nodded, and I nodded back with the half-smile men here use when they do not want to be accused of tenderness.\n\nAt Saint Rose, Darla stood in the cruel fluorescent of the lobby like a saint nobody would paint because her hair had escaped its pin and she\u2019d committed the unpardonable sin of existing in relief. She took the folder, scanned the phrases with the flinch of someone half-expecting to find her own name misspelled and her credentials misremembered, then exhaled like a small puncture in a stubborn tire.\n\n\u201cShe did it,\u201d she said, and I felt, for a second, the lovely silly wish to invite Lorraine to supper and cut her a second piece of pie without making a fuss. \u201cThey will call it a reprimand. We will call it anatomy. We need a body to pour this work into.\u201d\n\n\u201cA registry with teeth,\u201d I said, and the phrase tasted satisfying. \u201cYou get a chair. They will pretend to have invented you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can have the credit,\u201d she said, and her mouth insisted it wasn\u2019t a lie and her eyes asked me to remember to argue for her when she forgot she was owed. \u201cJoy\u2019s hair sprouted insultingly early this morning. Two millimeters of bravado along her temple. Earl cried about something on the television and blamed the weather.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me see her,\u201d I said. \u201cI need to recalibrate my face. I\u2019ve been in Jackson where people are paid to control the muscles around their mouths.\u201d\n\nJoy had propped her phone on the tray so she could watch a video of a woman teaching a bird to say something impolite. She waved without pausing the lesson because priorities line up differently when your body has been trying to leave you without your permission. The fuzz along her hairline really was audacious, like a field testifying that green can be a verb even after a fire. Her cheeks had bloomed that dangerous pink that means nothing and everything. When I told her about the registry-that-was-not and the chair-that-was, she nodded like a small mayor.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cMake it so it doesn\u2019t depend on me staying charming.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were never charming,\u201d I said. \u201cYou were honest and people keep mislabeling you because honesty sounds like a joke when you\u2019re used to compliments.\u201d\n\nShe laughed and her mother\u2019s face folded with gratitude so intense it looked like pain. Before I could name that, before I could ruin it by observing it too closely, my phone buzzed with a text from Aimee that did the work of a siren while pretending to be a whisper. The antibiotic had been marked on backorder by both of the large wholesalers who feed our small pharmacies. The reason field read: compliance. The second text contained a photograph of a man at the backdoor of our office holding a clipboard and a smile that had never been a child.\n\nAimee had written only, It begins, and when a secretary who has raised two sons and a business writes a sentence like that without an exclamation mark, you listen like it\u2019s thunder.\n\nThe warehouse men had nudged the river and then complained about the flood. The antibiotic wasn\u2019t special, except now it was. The generic wasn\u2019t common, except now it was rare in the way bread becomes rare in a snowstorm because everyone wants to remember what comfort tastes like. Aimee told the clipboard that any paperwork could be slid under our door because moving our rug was something she refused to perform for men she did not invite. The clipboard\u2019s smile stayed pinned but his eyes did what eyes do when they know the house is not afraid of them.\n\nDarla stood with her hand on the back of Joy\u2019s chair, thumb moving in a small rhythm that told me she was doing math. \u201cThere are animal versions,\u201d she said. \u201cDifferent concentration, same root. I will not poison anyone\u2019s daughter to spite a man\u2019s cousin. But I will make calls to every large animal vet within a hundred miles and I will look them in the soul and ask them what they see when they look back.\u201d\n\n\u201cPil has a cousin,\u201d I said automatically, because in Meridian everything you need is someone\u2019s cousin if you mark your map with enough pushpins. \u201cHe runs a feed store that has the air of a confessional. I\u2019ll talk to him. We will not have you feeding cattle pills to children. We will smooth this bureaucratically while we hunt in fields the board doesn\u2019t know how to plow.\u201d\n\nAs if summoned by audacity, Sloan called. He sounded thinner and stronger, like a wire pulled taut enough to sing. \u201cThey will cut supply,\u201d he said without introduction. \u201cI\u2019ve heard handshakes clicking all morning. Watch your pharmacies. I can\u2019t criminally prosecute a backorder, but I can ask questions in rooms that do not enjoy questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a state folder with a reprimand that asks for sunlight,\u201d I told him. \u201cLorraine sent it. We are to pretend we feel chagrined.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he said, and the word held a note I hadn\u2019t heard from him since we were young men rehearsing our shrugs in different mirrors. \u201cI am filing a public records request for procurement emails at Saint Rose and for any communications including the phrase \u2018alternate source\u2019 or \u2018temporary substitution.\u2019 Their IT will groan. My staff will hate me. My wife will love me for being someone she thought she had to misremember.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause at the back of his breath, and then he said, \u201cI moved on from humming. I wrote something that had the rudeness to be pretty. If you hear someone whistling in the courthouse, pretend you don\u2019t know who it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhistle louder,\u201d I said. \u201cMen in good suits are allergic.\u201d\n\nHe laughed, and it wasn\u2019t the tidy laugh you do when the room expects a noise; it was the kind that steals some of the heat from a day and gives it back when it has cooled it enough to hold.\n\nPil\u2019s cousin, whose name was Boone because of course it was, stood behind a counter piled with salt blocks, dewormer, and things I could not ethically confess to recognizing. He wore a hat that had known good summers and bad fence lines. When I mentioned the drug, he did not tilt his head like someone hearing a new thing. He ran his finger along the shelf tag like a man reading the future in tea leaves and then glanced at me with a frankness that would have ruined a less honest face.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the first to ask,\u201d he said. \u201cLast week Mrs. Ludwig drove down from across the river and bought two bottles after asking me five questions to make me feel like she had read a book about cattle she did not own. I sold her one. I can read a mother, but I can also count inventory. I will not keep a man from curing a calf because men here name their animals and cry when they pretend they don\u2019t. I can get you three bottles if you ask me as if I\u2019m your cousin, and not the way you ask for something illegal that isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking because my cousin is brave,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd because a warehouse man wants to teach us who has hands.\u201d\n\nBoone nodded like I\u2019d finally made a sentence worth hearing. He boxed the bottles with a solemnity that looked like prayer and took my money like it was a story I was letting him borrow. As he slid the package across, he said, \u201cTell your doctor that if she wants to sleep, she\u2019ll have to do it in the afternoon. Nights have gone sticky with people who want to be fixed while other people sleep.\u201d\n\nI left the feed store holding a cardboard cube that seemed to vibrate with metaphor if not with chemistry. It was not our solution. It was our insult to scarcity. Aimee texted me a photograph of the clipboard man sitting in his car with the kind of patience men practice when they believe their waiting is the waiting that counts. She had drawn horns on him with the notes app pen and sent a second text that said simply, lunch? I wrote back that I would bring her a sandwich that would make her consider forgiving me for becoming a crusader without asking her to buy more paper.\n\nBy late afternoon, the hospital smelled like the inside of a freezer-case because the air had decided to snap, and our blood was still on the soft setting. The board sent a memo telling staff to \u201cexpect a routine disruption\u201d as part of the site visit, which is a sentence only people with wood-paneled offices write and only people without keys to any room will be asked to believe. Darla read it in the hallway, crumpled it without grace, then smoothed it with the heel of her hand because a woman who has spent her life coaxing tissues to behave does not throw paper away unpressed.\n\n\u201cLet them disrupt in public,\u201d she said. \u201cI am tired of being scolded behind glass.\u201d\n\nJoy wanted the river. It was a good request masquerading as a bad idea. We loaded her gently into Earl\u2019s truck with the reverence men give things they are not trained to hold. The air near the water was thick with a humming that wasn\u2019t mechanical. The current did its quiet arithmetic, shouldering what the town handed it. Joy sat on the bank with her shoes off, toes in the mud like a small pagan, head tilted back to bite the light. She looked less like a patient than like a girl whose body had just learned summer again.\n\n\u201cDo you think the fish know anything about us,\u201d she asked without turning, \u201cor are we the kind of animals they tolerate the way we tolerate lightning?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are a rumor to fish,\u201d I said. \u201cBut a loud one.\u201d\n\nShe wiggled her toes and grinned. \u201cGood. I am tired of being a lesson. I would rather be noise.\u201d\n\nBehind us, someone played a violin on a porch. At first, I thought it was a radio, because the notes landed too assured for a man in Meridian on a Tuesday, and then I saw Oakes in the doorway of a little rental with a slumping roof. He had kept the violin as I\u2019d told him to, and the way his jaw set said he had paid for that choice with something domestic and complicated. The tune was old enough to belong to nobody, and young enough to make my chest feel like it had been laced tighter than style or propriety required. It wasn\u2019t quite sad. It was the sound a seam makes when it holds under strain.\n\nOakes waved with his bow and then went back to the work of making air behave. Across the road, a sheriff\u2019s cruiser idled in the shade as if it had been assigned to watch the water for crimes it did not wish to find. The deputy lifted his fingers in that universal gesture of a man who has seen too much and still wants to be seen as decent. The warehouse men did not appear, but the fact of them sat on the grass like a hat nobody admitted to owning.\n\nWe did not stay past dusk because the mosquitoes here are thorough and prefer the ankles of the idealistic. Back in town, I found a note taped to my door written in the florid hand of someone proud of their penmanship and uninterested in its uses. It did not threaten so much as curate: a list of names, each with a year beside it, men and women who had filed for bankruptcy after crossing the McCreedy cousins on matters of distribution. At the bottom, in tiny letters like an afterthought sewn into a hem, the question again: do you keep what\u2019s inside inside. I understood, not for the first time, that I was being addressed by someone who had misunderstood sewing as surgery.\n\nI took the list to Mrs. Hale, who was in her office stapling something with a vigor that suggested she believed she could attach the world to itself and keep it from fraying. She read it, lifted one eyebrow as if speaking privately to it, and slid it into a sleeve in a binder that would be labeled something like Antagonists: Accomplishments which is a system I respect more every time I see her use it.\n\n\u201cThey will exhaust you,\u201d she said, and poured me tea that tasted like someone had put lemon across the threshold and then asked it to wait outside. \u201cWin quick where you can. Lose with elegance where you must. Don\u2019t snarl unless you are willing to bite. And for the love of all that is holy, do not trip over your own cape.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would need to own a cape,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m still at the scarf stage.\u201d\n\n\u201cMen in scarves,\u201d she said drily, \u201care a menace if they don\u2019t understand their necks are vulnerable. Your client with the violin sent me a note. He wants a new will. He has fallen in love with a woman who sells perfume and refuses to borrow money from him, and he says this has rearranged his sense of justice. Tell him to come in Wednesday. I like women who refuse.\u201d\n\nThe next morning began with a thud that resolved into a letterbox chewing up something thick. The bar had docketed the complaint. It had a hearing date that suggested the clerk who chose it enjoyed planting events where they could ruin your favorite lunch. Aimee read the notice, then walked to my office and closed the door like she was making a room in which I might be allowed to be less brave.\n\n\u201cYou need to sleep in this chair with your jacket on and your shoes off for thirty minutes,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you do not, you will make a mistake on paper that will make me embarrassed to call your mother a good woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like your priorities,\u201d I said, and set my phone on the desk face down like a sinner laying down a weapon. She turned off the light and left the door cracked the way you do for a child, and I slept for twenty-two minutes and woke with a damp line where my face had made claims on the upholstery. In the dim, the office looked both foreign and delighted to have me vulnerable. I sat up slower than my day wanted and poured coffee with that trembling care you learn when you\u2019ve spilled too much lately.\n\nSloan beat me to the courthouse. When I arrived, he was steps from the rotunda, shirt sleeves rolled, tie loosened in a concession to the weather and to his sudden insistence that performances can be better for refusing some of their costumes. He held a sheaf of papers that looked like all the others and were not. At the top, in a font the secretaries favor because it suggests decency without announcing taste, the words Motion for Protective Order: Supply Interference sat with a calm that made me love my language again.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll say I\u2019m inventing a cause,\u201d he said, before I could praise him. \u201cI\u2019m not. I am stitching two causes together where they should have been introduced years ago. Restraint of trade does not become virtuous because a donor likes the company Christmas party.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hummed when you wrote that title,\u201d I said, and he looked down like a boy caught putting jam on the good knife.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I kept my job through lunch.\u201d\n\nThe hearing room smelled like dry books and men who decline water because they fear its softness. The judge wore his robe like a thin apology and his expression like a compromise with regret. Sloan spoke with that new slight lean he\u2019d found, the one that said he had discovered he had a body and it could carry him without cruelty. He did not mention Joy by name. He did not say cancer. He spoke about scarcity erected on purpose, about the difference between delay that saves life and delay that buys yachts. He used a word I hadn\u2019t heard him use before in a court: mercy.\n\n\u201cBoth sides like to argue as if we are in separate shops,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cAs if the law sells only tools and medicine sells only cures. We do not. We both sell time. Today I am asking you to sell it to the people with the least, rather than to the people with the most. It will sting someone. It always does.\u201d\n\nMcCreedy\u2019s lawyer, who had a talent for leaving no footprint on a rug, stood and said the phrase \u201coverreach\u201d with the unctuous authority of a man who has never reached for anything that wasn\u2019t handed to him. He smiled toward me like a man offering a seat on a boat he planned to sink when we got out a little ways. The judge listened with his head tilted, that foxlike posture you develop when you are being asked to bless something you know you\u2019ll meet again in a different robe. He took the motion and did not grant it. He took the motion and did not deny it. He did something I love him forever for and resent him the next hour over: he asked for an evidentiary hearing with affidavits from any pharmacist willing to write the sentence \u201cI was told to delay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis will make someone lose a job,\u201d Sloan said after, in the hallway that remembers every whisper. \u201cI am done being the man who arranges for the wrong people to lose jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will come for yours,\u201d I said. \u201cThey already have their pencils out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI bought a new one for myself,\u201d he said, and when I looked at his hand I saw he had a blister where his music had been practicing being heavier than the law.\n\nBy dinner, Pil had wrangled me onto the radio again because he believes in repetition the way grandmothers believe in butter. We talked around the supply, we talked toward the hearing, we did not say the word boycott, we said the phrase quiet harm, and the phones did their red show. A woman confessed that she had been told, once, to wait for a scan until the fiscal quarter turned over. A man admitted he had swapped labels in a stockroom because the only power he\u2019d been given was his handwriting and he had decided it could save a life. Neither hung up on time because people who have been carrying their stories need a runway long enough to lift them.\n\nSometime after nine, while I was still at the office pretending to tidy the stack of papers that had adopted me, the building breathed differently. The old hat store has a way of telling you when someone has opened its door even if that someone is trying to muscle their way into invisibility. A floorboard to the left of the stair creaked, not the friendly sound of Aimee\u2019s heels but the reluctant sound of a man in soft soles. I stood and did not reach for anything heavier than my own spine.\n\n\u201cYou can come in,\u201d I said, and the man with the straight teeth entered like a neighbor with a pie, only there was no dish and his hands were empty as a sermon that has decided to be cruel. He did not sit. He inspected my suit with his eyes and I let him, which is a small power, allowing someone to measure you by their own tape.\n\n\u201cWe prefer back channels,\u201d he said, patient as a parent with a child picking at a scab. \u201cYou have made us noisy. Noisy costs money. Do you know how many trucks we turn around when the radio makes the town think it deserves to perform its own medicine?\u201d\n\n\u201cFewer than you did last week, if the state has anything to say,\u201d I said. \u201cWhich it does. Nicely. With a folder.\u201d\n\nHe paced my office without shoes squeaking because men like him buy soles that have remembered how to behave. He looked at my bookshelf, the cheap law books dressed up by my vanity with two hardcovers that had dust jackets I hadn\u2019t removed because I married the phrase first edition once and never wanted to divorce it.\n\n\u201cWe can be friends,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not a threat. It is a promise. We can find a way to make your doctor\u2019s experiment live inside a carton we control. You like control. Lawyers pretend they don\u2019t and then you see them count their pens.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will not own this,\u201d I said. \u201cThere are things this town doesn\u2019t get to own anymore. Grief. Air. The protocols for mercy.\u201d\n\nHe stood still then, like someone had whispered a note he\u2019d been trying to find on an instrument he never learned. For a second, I saw the child he probably had been, the one who lined his toy cars in ranks not to be cruel but to impose order on a day that had no parent in it. Then his face shuttered like a window people are too gentle to slam.\n\n\u201cOrder keeps people from dying,\u201d he said. \u201cChaos kills. Your project is chaos in Sunday clothes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOrder without ethics is ash in a box you convince yourself is a church,\u201d I said, and he smiled like a teacher generously awarding me a B-plus.\n\n\u201cI will take your metaphor to lunch,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will lose your license. I will not. Both things will be regrettable. We will both survive.\u201d\n\nHe left without taking my air, which I count as a victory. I sat down and realized my hands had been clenched in my lap in a way my mother would have scolded me for at supper. I thought of Sloan\u2019s blister, of Darla\u2019s thumb tracing quiet circles on the back of a chair, of Lorraine\u2019s folder tucked like a heart into my jacket. I thought of Joy holding water with her feet, asking the river to remember her. Somewhere in town, Oakes was playing the last notes of a thing that had no name and that did not need one, and the warehouse men were doing math and the state was building a file cabinet for a kind of mercy that had never had its own drawer.\n\nJust before midnight, when the town does its loudest pretending at being quiet, my phone lit with a text from an unknown number and the words that can unmake a day or fortify it. I have receipts, it said. The photograph that followed was of an invoice from a month ago for a pallet of the very antibiotic we were begging for, marked paid by a shell company whose mailing address belonged to a church\u2019s dead P.O. box. The signature at the bottom had been obscured with one of those clumsy black bars people use when they think they\u2019ve learned the law from a television show. If you brightened the image, the bar went transparent at the edges and a little curve of an M showed through, the way thread does if you lift the seam to the light.\n\nBring coffee, the second text read. And a needle. I like men who can mend.",

                              "content": "Chapter 6\n\nThe text had that briskness people use when they\u2019ve made a decision and they\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll unmake it if anyone speaks too long. I answered with a time and the address of the church on Pecan, the one with the brick face that looks too steady for the century that made it. The fellowship hall smells like coffee and card tables and floor wax that remembers being stronger. It is the only place in Meridian where secrets and casseroles are set next to each other without commentary. I packed two large cups from E.J.\u2019s, the lids trembling like they didn\u2019t like the heat they\u2019d agreed to carry. Then I took my mother\u2019s needle tin down from the top shelf, the shallow metal one with strawberries on the lid and a scuff where a life once dragged across it. The heft of it in my hand steadied me. It\u2019s a ridiculous thing, to be calmed by a tin that rattles when you walk, but almost everything good in my life is ridiculous.\n\nI arrived five minutes early because I refuse to make church ladies wait, even if I wasn\u2019t certain my informant was one. The quilting circle had convened itself at the long tables, a loose congress of women who could run a legislature if asked and who have chosen, instead, to govern thread. Their hands moved while their mouths did, and if you\u2019ve never seen a needle pierce a quilt in time with a story, you have not understood what choreography is. Miss Laverne, who looks like she smells of starch even when she doesn\u2019t, lifted her chin toward a far table as if to say, Your witness is there, and also, do not drip coffee on the binding, I remember you as a child.\n\nShe sat apart with a posture that had practiced being unobtrusive and then decided, today, it would rather be noticed in the right way. She wore a dress in a faded flower, the kind that looks like it knows more seasons than your spine. Her hair was back with a clip you could buy for a dollar and then keep for twenty years. On the table in front of her lay a banner for a church homecoming, white satin with gold letters, the gold only a little gaudy, because even Methodists understand a festival requires a small sin. She did not extend her hand. She tapped two fingers on the banner hem and nodded once at the coffee.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Elise,\u201d she said, and the name landed with a small weight I didn\u2019t question. \u201cI\u2019m the one who checks the church P.O. box because Pastor Ray is too busy pretending mail is beneath him. This box has held Christmas letters, tithes from men who only like God at Easter, and every manner of passive-aggressive note a woman can send to another woman about committee work. Then it held invoices. Then it held checks.\u201d\n\nI slid the coffee toward her, careful of the satin, careful of the way she had positioned herself one step out of any safe light. She took a sip like a person who does not trust pleasure and then set the cup down with a sigh that said she remembered how it can save you.\n\n\u201cThey like to name their companies decent,\u201d she said, eyes on the hem. \u201cThis one is called Auxiliary Logistics. Auxiliary like helpful and logistics like they have a map. The return address is our old P.O. box with a new number written like a lie over an old truth. Their checks came from a foundation with a cross printed in the corner. I keep records because I was not allowed to go to college and I have been storing my learning in tidy marks and good paper ever since.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have receipts,\u201d I said, and she smiled without warmth, pleased I had not made her repeat herself.\n\n\u201cI have more than receipts,\u201d she said. \u201cI have their paper, and I have the shape of them. I have the right to be tired, and I have a friend at the pharmacy who tells me when the trucks are \u2018delayed\u2019 in a tone that means \u2018not delayed.\u2019 I have sent my nephew to take pictures of pallets in a storage unit with a lock that thinks it is admired. I have tucked a copy of all of it where church men won\u2019t look, because they do not believe in hems.\u201d\n\nShe pushed the banner toward me until the gold C of Christ wobbled and the satin whispered. I opened my mother\u2019s tin and the old smell of metal and talc and something like time lifted out. The needle felt right between my fingers. The hall went quiet in that way rooms do when something more interesting than complaint arrives. I slid the point under the seam and teased. Satin resists politely and then relinquishes. I pulled the hem three inches and my breath slowed the way it does when a lock gives to your key.\n\nFrom inside the false fold, she drew a sleeve, thin plastic, the kind you store photographs in when you promise yourself you will put them into an album and never do. Within, copies, thirty at least, of invoices and emails, some printed with that pale toner that says the printer hates the work it is doing. Names floated where they should not, not just the shell\u2019s, not just the cousin\u2019s, but a procurement manager at Saint Rose, two donor liaisons whose smiles have paid a mortgage, and one familiar curving M that completed itself when Elise held the page to the light just so.\n\n\u201cThey will burn me for this if they can,\u201d she said without ceremony. \u201cThey will call me jealous or silly or bitter or insane, and they will be correct at least once in their adjectives. I prefer brave. I prefer seamstress. I prefer citizen. I prefer woman who has had enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are all of those,\u201d I said, and I said it low because compliments sound truer when they are not performing into a microphone. \u201cWhat do you need from me besides coffee and a needle?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you to carry this like the thing it is,\u201d she said. \u201cI need you to turn it into a file a man can\u2019t pretend not to see. I need you to give it to someone with a hammer and then stand still while it hits and not flinch because you remember what flinching costs. I need you to keep my name out of the first story and, when it can be in safely, to put it there lovingly. I need you not to forget me if they ask you to.\u201d\n\nI promised the only way I know how, with my face. I tucked the sleeve into my brief bag the way you tuck a child into a coat that you do not trust to be warm enough. I resewed the banner with twice as many stitches as I had undone, because a seam like that deserves a redundancy and because women with scissors watched me and I did not intend to be rude.\n\n\u201cWill you stay and take a brownie you don\u2019t deserve,\u201d Miss Laverne called, which is how in Meridian you say you will be protected by something larger than you and it will not make the papers. Elise did not meet my eyes again. She ran her finger along the new seam, nodded once at the workmanship, and returned to stitching gold letters as if letters were any protection.\n\nOn the steps outside, the heat did its hawk impression. Sloan arrived at the same time as if summoned by a bell I had not heard. He had loosened his tie to the point that he might as well have taken it off, and his shirt sleeves looked like the part of a man that has been practicing confession. I lifted the sleeve of copies in my bag a fraction, and he inhaled like a doctor who has seen the color you hope for on a wound.\n\n\u201cChain of custody,\u201d he said, and for once the phrase sounded lovely. \u201cWe will do this like a lab. We will sign across tape. We will number pages. We will ask Elise\u2014I assume that is her name\u2014to write two paragraphs in her own hand and to tuck them in a Bible only she will touch, and we will not take them out until the judge asks us to, and we will hand him the book with respect.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe likes brave better than chain,\u201d I said, \u201cbut she\u2019ll do both.\u201d\n\nHe asked nothing more until we were back at my office, because he understands that some stories must be allowed to ride in the backseat with the window open. Aimee had cleared her desk with that efficiency that pretends the top sheet was always supposed to be the top sheet. She produced labels with the gravity of a pharmacist. She produced a roll of red evidence tape from a drawer where she keeps things she hopes never to need. We numbered pages in a silence that dignified the mess. We signed across seams. We set the sleeve in a box we had not previously designated sacred and then did.\n\nLorraine answered my call on the first ring, which made me love her more than I had permission to. I told her what we had and she did not exclaim. She asked me to photograph one page that did not matter and to read aloud, slowly, the dates on three that did. She said the words \u201cpublic interest\u201d the way farmers say rain and the way mothers say enough. She gave us the name of a man in the attorney general\u2019s office who cannot keep a secret and a woman in procurement who can. Then she said, \u201cBless the woman who hid that in a hem,\u201d and hung up like her hands were already occupied with other mercies.\n\nWhen we went to see Elise with a simple witness statement on letterhead that meant nothing and would mean everything, she had already put on her cardigan like armor. She wrote in a careful hand that one of the quilting ladies murmured over because it was pretty, and women are allowed to say, even at the edge of trouble, that a thing is pretty. She did not read what she wrote aloud. She slid it into the endpaper of a red Bible with a zipper, the kind campers use, and I laughed because God likes a man who appreciates a zipper. She handed the Bible to me under one condition, which she said out loud so it would stick to the walls.\n\n\u201cYou will give it back to the church after,\u201d she said, and I did not say after what.\n\nThe evidentiary hearing came hard and quick because Sloan had phrased his motion like something a decent man would want to hear while he still had a throat for questions. The courtroom filled with the usual: men in shirts that believe in starch, women with their dignity pinned where it was visible, a few kids whose teachers had called in a favor to turn law into civics for an hour. The warehouse men arranged themselves in the back like an upholstery sample of confidence. McCreedy\u2019s lawyer wore a suit so correct it looked like it had voted already.\n\nSloan did the preliminaries with less theater than I like and more courage than I used to believe he owned. He marked the box, he called the thing a set of records, he asked the judge to mark the sleeve as an exhibit with a number that would look solemn on paper. He took the Bible from my hands with a look that took the measure of my religion and decided it did not matter. He unzipped and slid the two paragraphs out as if he were drawing breath. He did not look up as he read. When he reached the sentence where Elise had written, \u201cI recognized the handwriting because I have been receiving church checks in that hand for eighteen years,\u201d I saw the judge exhale and not want anyone to notice.\n\nMcCreedy\u2019s lawyer asked questions that resize a person until they fit into the story he needs. He wondered whether Elise\u2019s motives were pure, as if there were a test for that at the pharmacy next to the blood pressure cuff. He wondered whether she resented men who count money. He wondered whether she understood the term shell in the non-beach context. She did not answer from the stand because she was not on it. Her words answered in their good dress, and the hearing became a place where a woman\u2019s neat script could make a man summarize himself.\n\nThe pharmacists came in whispered and left with their mouths braver. One man with a name badge that had lost its backing tape testified that he had been told to wait on a shipment because of \u201ccompliance,\u201d and when asked to define compliance, he looked at the warehouse men and said, \u201cBeing obedient to the wrong person.\u201d A woman with hair the color of a good sweet potato admitted she had altered a date field because she had been told to by someone who could not spell her name right. None of this was perfect. All of it was real.\n\nOutside after, the air had the iron of a coming storm, or else we were all tasting the same fear in our mouths and mistaking it for weather. Sloan leaned against the wall not to look casual but because body and wall had finally stopped arguing. He had a smudge of red ink on his thumb where the tape had kissed him. He glanced down at it the way a man glances at proof of a game he had not intended to play and then nodded like he would, in fact, play it again.\n\n\u201cThey will wiggle,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will return a few cases to the pharmacies. They will blame a clerk. They will send their cousins to church. They will deny the shell is theirs. They will call Auxiliary an unfortunate coincidence and Logistics a misunderstanding of gratitude.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will send more bears with their bellies cut,\u201d I said, and he laughed without warmth this time, and then warmth arrived two beats late like a person running for the bus.\n\nHe went home to a child who was still small enough to climb onto knees and a piano small enough to sound like a toy even when someone serious touched it. Darla went back to do rounds without a badge, a woman who had taught herself a new way to carry what she wasn\u2019t allowed to show. I went to Aimee\u2019s desk because she had that look like she had spare courage in her drawer and was ready to loan it out. She gave me a sandwich, because she is a prophet of what you can accomplish when your blood sugar is not a pathetic idea, and then she brought me a stack of envelopes without return addresses because she has been paying attention.\n\nThe warehouse men weren\u2019t idle while we played our pretty little legal music. Boone called to say a man had come by the feed store making conversation about the spring calves and had looked at the shelves with math eyes. The hospital sent a memo about pharmacy substitutions written in a tone administrators use when they want to sound like they care about your diet. Someone unscrewed the porch light at Elise\u2019s house and then screwed it back in badly so it would flicker and make her think her power was sick. She put on her cardigan and fixed the bulb and texted me a picture of the screwdriver with the caption, I can mend my own light.\n\nJoy\u2019s numbers, because the universe likes us better when we think we deserve it, continued to behave. Her phone began to fill with things she wanted to remember later, and I have never been so honored to be sent such incompetently framed pictures. One was of her own forehead in a mirror, the fuzz reaching like a little joke that had decided to live. In the corner, taped to the glass, she had stuck a list that made my throat do something I associate with the last three minutes of a movie you didn\u2019t think could earn your tears. It said: Ferris wheel at dusk, teach Earl to eat sushi, touch the river in winter, write a letter to the girl I was when I was twelve and put it in the freezer to make it last, learn a song without words.\n\nOakes stopped by with a bottle of terrible wine and a face that felt like it had just learned to be handsome. He had not sold the violin. He had met the woman with the perfume and she refused his offer of a check and accepted his offer of a walk around the block, which is how you know you are not a fool and have been for long enough that the universe owes you a little mercy. He played in my office while I pretended to sign something, because sometimes pretending you are at work is a better prayer than the ones we make on Sundays.\n\nThe bar complaint sat like a visitor who does not know how to excuse themselves gracefully. Mrs. Hale and I practiced what I would say. She told me to keep my adjectives folded small and my nouns lined up in their pews. She told me to press the temptation to grandstand like a wrinkle into a shirt with a hot iron and to pretend it was never there. She allowed me two metaphors and one memory, and took a yellow pencil and scored a line through the part of my draft that started with my mother and ended with grief, which felt like being corrected by a line of women in the quilts, and it was right.\n\nIn the middle of all this, Sloan sent me a recording late at night that he did not introduce. It was a minute and a half of a melody that felt like a walk around our block where someone has straightened their porch chairs and swept their step. It was stubbornly pretty, the way some men are pretty despite themselves, and it did the thing music sometimes does where it hangs a picture in your chest you didn\u2019t give it permission to mount. I played it twice. On the third, I realized I was crying in the stupid ugly way that makes your jaw ache, and because I am trying to become the sort of person who tells the truth out loud in rooms where it will be used properly, I texted him, It made me hold my breath in the right way. He wrote back a single word and it wasn\u2019t sorry. It was thanks.\n\nThe judge set the second hearing for a date that sat like a thumb in the middle of our week. Sloan would ask for the protective order again, this time with the red-taped sleeve and the pharmacists\u2019 affidavits and the red Bible we would hand over with reverence, not because it was the law but because it belonged to a woman who had fixed her own lightbulb at midnight. Lorraine promised a person with a clipboard and a skeptical face at Saint Rose by Tuesday, and I told Darla I would bring her a dress with a good pocket and she told me to bring her instead a pen that doesn\u2019t run and a thermos of soup.\n\n\u201cI dreamed last night I was stitching a vein,\u201d Darla said in the corridor, voice barely above polite. \u201cIt was not violent. It was tidy. The body held still for me and the thread behaved and when I woke I understood I do not want to be praised for being brave anymore. I want to be paid in a sleep that does not take my pulse.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building you a registry with a chair,\u201d I said, like a man advertising a porch. \u201cWe cannot promise sleep. We can promise a place to sit.\u201d\n\nWe walked together down the too-bright hall and nodded at a nurse whose hair had learned to make its own rules. The supply closet door was open a precise three inches, as if to announce absence. A foil package had been ripped too neatly to be accident and thrown away badly to be innocence. We have both learned how to read crime in the casual. Darla picked it up and smoothed it on her knee. Her fingers lingered on the edge where the serrations had been asked to do more than they were designed for. She slipped it into her pocket without ceremony, because sometimes the chain of custody begins with a woman who would rather heal than be tidy.\n\nThe site visit began in a conference room with lemon and mint in the water like Lorraine had predicted. A woman with a badge from the department sat with her shoulders arranged like a jazz rhythm and asked questions so clean they sounded like kindness. The board tried on their faces for responsibility and found that the fit did not flatter them. McCreedy called the Auxiliary a \u201ctemporary philanthropic vehicle,\u201d and the woman with the badge wrote down those words like they were obliging little cattle she might lead into a pen later. Sloan did not attend because he understands better than I do when you need a man in a hallway and not at a table. I stayed because I wanted to see the expressions men make when the compliments they practiced for years fall to the carpet like paper you thought would behave.\n\nAt a break, the warehouse man with the good teeth approached me with a smile so clean it squeaked. He asked if I had enjoyed my sandwich and I told him the bread had been dry and the mustard cheap. He told me he admired my persistence and I told him I admired his wardrobe because it served the story he had chosen. He asked what story that was and I said the one where you tell yourself you are the kind of man who can stand in a room with dying people and argue for margins and not look down when your hands tremble. He looked down, and then he looked back up and said, \u201cWe can do high-minded all day, Barrett, but the numbers will ask for blood eventually.\u201d I said, \u201cLet\u2019s give them ours.\u201d\n\nWhen I returned to the office, Aimee had put the sleeve in a box with a red thread tied around it because that is the sort of practical poetry she is capable of when she has eaten. She had also placed a small card on my desk with Elise\u2019s name written in her best cursive and a phone number in a hand that looked like it had been taught by a teacher with a switch. Underneath, in Aimee\u2019s print, were the words: She came by. Brought a pie. Told me to tell you the stitch held. P.S. It\u2019s a chess pie. You like it better than you admit.\n\nThat night, because I am not quite the man I was, I took my mother\u2019s quilt off the back of the chair and spread it over my bed. The room altered. It is a foolish thing to claim a blanket rearranges your lungs, but this one did, because quilts, like good filings and bad arguments, have a way of encouraging your body to remember its shape. My phone lit once on the nightstand and I let it. The city hummed its thin summer song. Down on Pecan, in the fellowship hall, women stitched and told the stories women tell when they do not intend any man to hear them, and a banner with a mended hem waited for a Sunday when it could boast without shame. Somewhere, a deputy flicked his cruiser lights for no reason except the human wish to light yourself up to prove you have some say in the dark.\n\nIn the morning, we would take the red-tied box and the red Bible and the affidavits to the courthouse and set them on the table where men with pens could not pretend they were not heavy. Lorraine would send an email with six words that could change a weather pattern and we would respond with sixteen that might hold. The pharmacy would receive a truck with a driver who had been told to pretend he got lost and he would not get lost. Joy would wake with her hair the exact right length to be mistaken for a choice. Sloan would whistle in the stairwell and forget, for an entire flight, that he was whistling. And I would put my hand on my chest where the small, stupid ache lives and feel it, like a seam you check not because you think it will fail but because you have learned that checking is a way to love the garment more.",

A wind out of nowhere practiced its way down the courthouse lane and sent the magnolia petals spinning like pale coins too large to spend. I ironed a shirt that had never deserved an iron and told myself I was smoothing stubbornness into cotton, which is the kind of lie a man tells when he needs his sleeves to remember a better posture. Aimee pressed a thermos into my hand at the door and a packet of crackers into my pocket like I was being sent to first grade behind on my letters and ahead on appetite. Pil texted a blessing he\u2019d stolen from a gospel song and signed it with a lightning bolt he pretends is a joke. On the steps, Sloan stood without his tie and with the new angle to his stance that said he had conceded his shoulders were for more than announcing his rank. He did not hum. He breathed like a man who had once monitored his breath for other men and had decided to keep it private until he needed the room to hear him.\n\nInside, the courtroom had the cold of a place that tries to keep feelings under glass. The judge\u2019s clerk shuffled paper like a percussionist tasked with keeping time for a march that did not suit him. McCreedy\u2019s lawyer sat with his portfolio open like a mouth lined with expensive teeth. The warehouse men arranged themselves behind him in that neat ridge a certain species of confidence leaves wherever it sleeps. Darla slid into a pew as if church had finally agreed to count her among the congregation. Lorraine wasn\u2019t there, but her folder might as well have been; I felt its plain gravity at my back like a hand.\n\nSloan called it up like something you pull from a well and take time to admire for the sheen it managed to save. He laid our red-taped box on the evidence table with the square, deliberate tenderness of a man setting down a child after a long walk. The pharmacists\u2019 affidavits went behind it, a fan of paper that held names we\u2019d gotten good at saying in quiet rooms. He didn\u2019t raise his voice. He didn\u2019t point. He spoke about interference without law, a little like pneumonia without fever\u2014the kind that hides until a person learns to listen to their own breath the way they learned to pretend not to. He used that word again, the one he had risked last time. Mercy. He said it without italics, which made it heavier.\n\nMcCreedy\u2019s man did his professional frown and worried at the thread of intent like a cat that believes rugs were invented for it. He called the invoices unfortunate and the shell \u201cmerely an administrative convenience\u201d and, for a wild moment, looked regretful, as if the phrase had cut his gums. The judge listened in that foxed way old men have when they understand a thing is true and are deciding if it is safe to admit it in public. He asked where the missing pallets had gone. He asked what policy had been invoked when the word compliance was put to work as a bouncer outside a door where patients waited in their good clothes with their hats in their hands. And then he did the thing we had been afraid to want him to do: he granted the order.\n\nHe didn\u2019t grant us the cathedral some of us wanted. He gave us a steady chapel with a door that locked. Temporary. Narrow. Immediate. No vendor could withhold the antibiotic or its equivalents from any licensed pharmacy in the county absent an actual, documentable shortage or a federal recall. No substitution could be made for a hospital formulary item already in use without a patient-specific sign-off by a treating physician. All communications regarding acquisition of the relevant drugs were to be preserved and produced on seven days\u2019 notice upon request of the department or the court. He read the words like nails. They went in straight. They made that nice sound when the last tap brings the head flush to the wood.\n\nSomething like breath moved through the room, and for once it wasn\u2019t a hymn. The warehouse men didn\u2019t flinch. They don\u2019t. It isn\u2019t how they were taught to make their faces. But one of them touched his cuff with two fingers as if remembering, too late, that fabric frays where it\u2019s used most often. McCreedy stared as if we had sold him a dog and then told him it was a wolf. Darla closed her eyes and opened them and reached up to push a lock of hair behind her ear that had dared to escape and then let it fall where it wanted to, which is the kind of small rebellion you learn when your larger ones have been priced. Sloan said nothing. He took his copy of the order, folded it once, then placed it flat again like he hadn\u2019t trusted his first instinct with paper in a long time and was beginning to.\n\nOut on the steps, the heat had returned to its post like a guard who had taken a short, guilty nap. People touched my sleeve more than I am comfortable with, which is to say at all, and said my name in ways that made me wish I had been less available to names. A man I did not know put his hand on Sloan\u2019s shoulder and squeezed once and left behind on the cotton a small wet mark his palm had made, and Sloan\u2014who would once have looked down at that like a stain\u2014let it sink in. Pil appeared from nowhere with a microphone he had no business having anywhere near a courtroom and asked me for a sentence that would fit between two weather reports, and I gave him \u201cNo one gets to lock the pantry when the house is on fire,\u201d which is truly a ridiculous sentence but will play well at noon.\n\nThe order did what orders do. It behaved like a sudden stop sign on a road people had driven too fast down for years. There were near-collisions. There was cussing. There were some who slowed and looked around like men surprised to find the neighborhood had always been there and had gotten prettier while they drove with their heads down. A truck that had been circling turned its nose toward a pharmacy that had run out and, in a great show of compliance as performance, backed up too slowly to prove it had patience. We didn\u2019t clap. We watched. Elise texted me a picture of the porch light glowing steady and a second of her hand with a line of red where she\u2019d pricked herself on a pin. She had wrapped a Band-Aid tight enough to leave an oval, and beneath the photo she wrote, I mend fast.\n\nThat night, on the boardwalk that pretends the river likes to be civilized, Earl took Joy for sushi and managed, with a face like a man squaring up to a bull, to get a piece of tuna into his mouth without once looking betrayed. Joy took a picture of his eyes going wide like a child who has eaten snow for the first time and sent it to me with a caption that said, Look what the world can stand. Her fuzz had become a line, and the line had ideas. She kept touching it as if to remind it there would be scalp for it to visit if it would just act decent in public. Darla watched them from a polite distance like a woman hiding a smile in a chapel and texted me a list I didn\u2019t deserve: the registry draft had come back with teeth intact, Lorraine had set a date for a first committee that would not call itself a committee, and the hospital had quietly returned her access to a few rooms without returning her badge, which is how institutions apologize when they want someone to be grateful and forgetful on schedule.\n\nThe bar set its little table near the back of my week and asked me to sit up straight and be small. Mrs. Hale arrived early with a tote bag that might well have been older than I am, and set out papers like plates. She touched my wrist once\u2014not for tenderness, for calibration\u2014and told me again which adjectives were the kind that get a man admired at supper and fired at breakfast. The panel wore the faces of people who had looked forward to noon and found themselves again at nine-thirty. I opened my mouth and closed it and then remembered to begin where Mrs. Hale had told me to: with verbs. I advised. I witnessed. I filed. I did not sell hope; I described a choice. If any of my sentences tried to sit on a lap they didn\u2019t belong in, Mrs. Hale cleared her throat in a register that could cut paper. When they asked about the radio, I said that telling the truth is marketing\u2019s older sister and the one who always stays to do dishes. When they asked if I profited, I told them I had learned to make my own sandwiches. When they asked about the line where I had said you can\u2019t enjoin hope, I said I had been sentimental and meant I had been clumsy and then did not repeat it, which is a thing I am proud of because it is not my habit.\n\nWhen they came back, their decision wore a suit that fit fine. Dismissed with admonition. It read like the note a careful teacher writes in the margin of a boy\u2019s good essay where the paragraphs had gotten in an argument and had to be separated. Do not use the word miracle in any setting where a microphone may be present. Do not sign anything that smells like medicine. Do not use your mother as an argument unless directly asked. They did not put that last one in ink. They did not need to.\n\nWe celebrated by doing something ordinary badly. Pil dragged us to the fair out on the edge of town where the Ferris wheel lifts you exactly high enough to regret the view and then brings you back. The air smelled like grease and something whose sugar had been set on fire and forgiven. We stood in line like men who have not been allowed to stand in lines because other men have been calling their names out of them. Oakes showed up with his violin in a case he did not intend to open and opened it anyway because a child asked him to, and he found a corner where the speakers couldn\u2019t insult him and played. He didn\u2019t play anything anyone could hum after. He played the kind of tune that only exists in the ear where it is first heard and then refuses to travel. Sloan stood two yards away with his hands in his pockets and his head tilted and I watched him do the thing he had not been doing, which was to let his face be disorganized with pleasure. Joy reached the top of the wheel and shouted into the evening not a word, but a noise that felt like a hand slicing through water and finding it colder and better than expected. Earl held her ankle the way fathers hold ankles by muscle memory, and when they came down she held a prize she had not won, a blue bear with eyes too large for the head the way some mercies are too large for the days that carry them.\n\nWe had a week. I won\u2019t call it peace, because peace is presumptuous. It was a stretch of days when the worst thing I had to contend with was a man at the hardware store wanting to tell me his cousin had been misdiagnosed in \u201898 and what we were doing now would have saved her then, and what did I propose to do about that particular time travel. The trucks came and did not pretend to be lost. The pharmacies on the dead-end streets got deliveries before the ones in the neighborhoods where the houses had cul-de-sacs like rings. The site visit produced a draft report that did not flinch at names, and the board responded with jargon that made me want to iron my tongue. Lorraine wrote me a four-line email that said as much with fewer nouns: We found a spine. Keep your nose clean. Bring us the next three patients. Do not confuse applause with progress.\n\nThe warehouse men did not forget how to curse a day. They switched tactics the way men do when a door closes softly and makes them wonder who paid for the hinge. Somebody dumped a stack of copy paper into the alley behind the office because our shredder had broken the week we started taking ourselves seriously and I hadn\u2019t replaced it. Aimee went out with a broom and an expression she reserves for men wearing sandals with socks. She swept up the blank pages and said, without venting any heat she might have had a right to, that some folks don\u2019t know the difference between mess and message. Someone let the air out of my tires and left four quarters on the hood like payment. I rolled the coins between my fingers and put them in a drawer where I keep kinds of currency that will not spend the way their faces suggest.\n\nOne night, the office learned a new kind of quiet. The old hat store hum is familiar to me now; the building and I share our small noises like people who have chosen to be married in a town that doesn\u2019t know what to do with them. This quiet had weight. The lock didn\u2019t protest. Whoever it was had practiced not making doorways take sides. I was sitting on the floor behind my desk because the chair had begun to feel like a perch and my knees needed to understand ground again. The man with the clean teeth wasn\u2019t there. They didn\u2019t send him for this sort of work. Two silhouettes. One held something that glinted. Not a weapon that argued. A blade that predicted. They went to the shelves like men looking for their own names and found nothing but files. A hand tugged at the red thread on the evidence box and then stopped when it met the neat seam of tape signed across by men who believe ink can hold. He looked at the other and made that small sound men make when they\u2019ve been raised not to call out and something still presses on their throat. He set the box down as if it might snake. They left through the front because they wanted me to know they had known where I was and had chosen not to step on my neck. When I stood, my legs had that song you get after a run you didn\u2019t train for and I pressed my palm on the red thread to make sure I could still feel the cordage through the cardboard. Aimee came from the back room holding the big stapler like a joke she was committed to and said, very calmly, that she would install a bell that made enough racket to please God.\n\nIf the town had any doubt about itself, the storm cleared it. A feeder band off a hurricane that didn\u2019t know how to be generous came up the Pearl like an argument. The sky cast a green I associate only with the seconds before someone says something they cannot unsay. Power went out in clumps. Saint Rose\u2019s generators decided they would like to demonstrate principles instead of performing their duty. Darla called me not to complain but because she has learned I am a man who will bring soup and a cooler and pretend either is a solution and then carry other things without a complaint I have not yet earned the right to make. Aimee took charge of flashlights like a field marshal pressed into service by boredom. Pil went on-air with a battery pack and told the town where the limbs were down and which grocery would sell you ice if you told the cashier your mother\u2019s name without smiling. Sloan showed up at the hospital in a shirt he did not deserve to sweat through and lifted boxes until his breath got messy and then he lifted more because he understands now that the body insists on being present for justice and not just the voice.\n\nIn the dim, Joy\u2019s room had the glow you get when the machines have decided not to perform for the audience and the human bodies do what they were taught by older human bodies. Earl fanned with a church program stolen from a funeral that had had better music than preaching. Joy made a joke about how much air costs when you get it by the ounce and then apologized to the nurse because she had made it all the way to a place past fear where humor becomes a skin you can live in. Darla moved like a woman reading a dance step that had been written for a floor that had warped overnight. The drug hung and dripped its careful repetitions. The antibiotic did its old-fashioned courage. We took turns pushing a cart back and forth between the pharmacy and the rooms whose lights were lying about their capacity to comfort.\n\nAt some hour that had forgotten which side of midnight to claim, we walked the hallway and saw a door ajar that never is. The supply closet had blown its cover again, or perhaps had chosen to. A box we did not need tipped forward and put its face on the floor. The thing we did need sat patient at the back like a shy child in a classroom that\u2019s learned to reward noise. Something in me that had been on its half-knees for a month stood. We took what the order permitted and what the night demanded. We signed nothing. We made a note. We slid the packages into the coolers that had held other known mercies and kept them cold the way a town keeps the names of the dead without pretending it likes the chore. Dawn arrived like a man late to a meeting: breathless, wrong shirt, eager to convince us it had meant well all along.\n\nWhen the lights came back, the town clapped at nothing in particular and wept where it had stashed its water. Sloan showed up at my office with a piano bench under his arm and I suppose that is a sentence only my life gets to hold. He set it down, and then, almost sheepish, pulled a cheap keyboard from a case and plugged it into an outlet as if he were a teenager who had gotten his first amplification without a parent present. He played me what he\u2019d promised\u2014the stubborn lovely\u2014and I sat in my chair and realized my chair could be a pew if it wanted to and that I had been wrong to ask it to be only a place for taking calls that hurt. He didn\u2019t ask me if it was any good because he had stopped needing my permission for his breath. When he finished, he said, without looking up, that he had given his notice.\n\nHe had done it quietly, because there are men in this world who do not owe an explosion, and he had written it in a hand that tried not to look like it was scripting a divorce and failed. He would stay through the month. He would see the motion through and he would take whatever punishment men like McCreedy thought they had earned the right to deliver by dint of owning floors we must walk across. He would then\u2014here his voice went unsteady and correct itself\u2014he would then work out of his house for a while, a room with a door and a little old wood that had learned where to creak and how to hush. His wife had agreed. His boy had clapped without knowing why. The office had blinked and smiled with only one side of its mouth. The town would do what towns do: pretend it had predicted it and take credit for encouraging him once by sitting attentively when he had said something handsome on a panel.\n\nThere is a moment in every new correctness where you look for permission and find, to your surprise, that the person you want to ask is asleep. Mrs. Hale, who never naps, allowed herself fifteen minutes in the chair in her back room and told the receptionist to wake her if someone came in with anything that smelled like a summary judgment. Lorraine sent a note saying she\u2019d like to set a date for the pilot that could not be called a pilot and suggested that date be just far enough out to suggest responsibility and just near enough to imply urgency. The judge issued an order on a procurement email that read like a mother\u2019s note left on a counter for a son who had taken the car and not called: Tell me where you were. Tell me who you were with. Tell me why you did not think I would wait up.\n\nWe took Joy to the river in the middle of the week because her list did not respect the calendar. It rained a little in sunshine, which is the only weather I believe in. She lay back on a blanket that had seen more grass than laundry and looked at the kind of blue that has something in it you can\u2019t get your hands on. She dictated the letter to her twelve-year-old self because writing tired her. Dear Joy, you will think you are a joke for so long. You are not. You will think Earl is a fool and he is and he isn\u2019t. You will think your hair is your personality and you will be wrong and then right. You will think the river is only summer and you will not know it freezes at the edges and the middle still moves. Fold this and put it near the peas. The brain likes to think in gardens. Her mother cried in that way women cry when other people might lay claim to the sadness if it runs, and wiped her eyes on the oranges scarf and then looked annoyed she had left marks on the fruit.\n\nWe got word from Buckley\u2019s sisters that his numbers had tilted in a way that made them take out their good bowls. One sent a picture of him on the porch with the dog asleep on his foot like a weighted blanket, his cheeks fallen less and his eyes gone bright in a way that made me wonder if the drug doesn\u2019t, in a small way, instruct the soul to behave. We sent back a recipe for a soup he wouldn\u2019t make, because men like Buckley do not make soup. They ask the women whose hair they comb to make it and then insist on doing the dishes and chip a plate on purpose to announce they should never be allowed in the kitchen again. Darla drove out once at dusk with a trunk full of refrigerated stubbornness and all the words she had promised herself she would never say at a stranger\u2019s table and said them anyway. She called me from the road, and I could hear the kind of dark where trees practice being taller, and said, very softly, that his sisters had wanted to pray and she had allowed them to and had put her hand on a shoulder the way women do when the prayer needs a body to land on.\n\nThe bears kept arriving. It had become a language, and I resented my fluency. The next had a stitch down the back as neat as a zipper and inside\u2014a name tag from a charity gala where men had swapped jackets and stories without embarrassment. The next had no cut at all, just a pin in the paw with a note that said we are patient, and that one I gave to Joy after pulling the pin and she laughed and named it Patience because children, even when they have been in rooms where numbers decide everything, still enjoy turning a threat into a pet. Elise came by the office and fixed the loose thread on that one with such efficiency that I understood why men had once mistaken women like her for magicians and then punished them for it. She stayed for coffee and told Aimee she had been at the bank and seen a teller explain compound interest to a boy without condescension and had to sit down on the curb and breathe because it had been so beautiful. Then she stood and said she had pies in the car and would bring one only if we swore to bring the tin back with its dignity, and left without waiting for our oath because she knows us.\n\nThe AG\u2019s office\u2014which is to say, one man who cannot keep a secret and one woman who never will\u2014issued a letter that said the word investigation without apology. Lorraine sent it to me with an attachment that contained more redactions than sense, and I wrote back a note I will keep for the rest of my life because of how few words it took to be correct. We were not wrong. She replied with a single period and I understood I had, at last, earned punctuation.\n\nOn a Saturday, when all decent upheavals ought to rest, Sloan asked me to meet him at the courthouse. He had gotten permission from the janitor, who understands the law of mop buckets and music and treats them both as liquid. In the rotunda, where once the echo had belonged only to men who liked to hear their jokes returned to them twice, Sloan set up his keyboard and Oakes stood like a man who had been waiting his whole life to be allowed to be this version of himself in a public building. They played together without speaking, two instruments remembering what a bridge is for, and people drifted in because the town knows when air changes. The deputy leaned in the door with his hat in his hand. Miss Laverne stood under the mural and cried with her mouth closed. A child lay down on the tile to feel the sound better because children know acoustics in their bones. I stood and let my face loosen where it wanted and I did not apologize for it then or later. Between songs, Sloan said, like a man who had discovered an extra room in his own house, that he had taken a lease on the old hat repair shop two doors down from me and would be teaching a few piano students on weekdays and some men who needed to learn what their wrists were for on Saturdays. He looked afraid and certain in the precise amounts needed to be forgiven in advance.\n\nThat night, I slept under my mother\u2019s quilt with the window open and the fan doing its clicking metronome. The street sounded like a town that had worked and washed and gone to bed without finishing every task and forgiven itself for it. My phone sat face down like a respectful witness. When I woke, I had dreamed nothing sententious and felt for the cut at the crease of my thumb and found that it had knitted without me watching. Downstairs, a letter waited from Lorraine with a letterhead that still surprises me because I am not used to being written to by the state without dread. She wanted Darla in Jackson on Monday to sit in a room where a whiteboard would pretend to contain the choices of a whole body, and she wanted me to come, too, only to carry a folder and not to speak unless someone needed a sentence taken apart and sewn back together.\n\nWe dressed like we were going to a funeral that had been postponed and went to sit in a room where people had brought their own pens and had decided that day would obey them. Carrow sat quietly and earned the attention of a woman whose attention had been late to waking. A statistician with a haircut that could have been used to cut paper wrote numbers in a way that made the air relax because the slash of a seven had not been enlisted to lie. Darla spoke like water, steady and insistent and bending around some rocks. I spoke once and made a joke that did its work and then shut up, which is the kind of victorious maturity that ought to win a man a prize he does not need. A schedule went up under the kind of heading men like me can die under\u2014Pilot, North District, Phase One\u2014and we all pretended not to see the irony and wrote names under months like children at the chalkboard pretending school is permanent.\n\nDriving home, the fields had that September lie where they look done when they are not. The magnolias had traded their lacquer for dust, and the freight train made a sound like grease, and Meridian did that thing where it made itself smaller to fit into your chest and then larger just to prove it could. A text from Buckley\u2019s sisters came through saying he had slept a whole night and dreamed about a fence his daddy had built wrong and we all knew what that meant: the body had decided, briefly, to continue. Joy sent a photo of the freezer with a letter tucked behind the peas and a smile that did not run from its own face. Aimee had bought a new shredder and had put a ribbon around it and told the office it should greet it with respect. Elise had baked, which meant we had won something temporary and beautiful.\n\nI pulled into my drive and saw, at the base of the pecan, a box with no return address and a ribbon that had cost someone more than decency dictates. Inside, a bear with no seam cut and no pin and no card. Around its belly, a small belt of measuring tape like the kind my mother used to snap when she wanted my shoulders to behave. The tape had numbers that didn\u2019t line up, and for a second my throat did that closing thing grief and laughter use in common. I took the tape off, coiled it, and put it in the drawer where I keep other instruments no one has asked me to play. The bear went on the chair beneath the quilt and did its small, silly work of making the room remember it could hold softness and peril in adjacent chairs without one swallowing the other.\n\nI was making coffee I didn\u2019t need when the phone rang with the sound I have learned to call urgent without letting it claim my whole face. Lorraine\u2019s voice had that thread of iron she keeps coiled for use, and she said the words any town like ours has been waiting to have to hear and not hear. The AG\u2019s office had served warrants. Someone had bent, and not the person whose bending would have been satisfying. A procurement manager had confessed before she had been asked to. A warehouse bookkeeper had discovered his god. Auxiliary had dissolved itself overnight like sugar in hot water and left behind the aftertaste of cheap mint. There would be charges. There would be statements. There would be Sunday. She said, as if we were talking about rain, that we should expect a parade and an ambush and that sometimes in life they are the same block.\n\nI stood with the phone to my ear and watched the steam write its ceremony in the kitchen air and then vanish, and I thought of the seam in the courthouse rotunda where two old stones meet and how, if you run your finger along it, you can feel the line but it will not cut you. I thought of Sloan, who would be learning a new quiet in his house, and of Darla, who would be buying a dress with pockets not because of the meeting but because she had remembered what to put in them. I thought of Joy, who would be making a list of things you can do with hair two inches long that you cannot do with hair you hide inside a scarf, and of Earl, who would say sushi now as if it were his idea. I thought of Elise, who would be mending the hem of a banner we would one day walk beneath without forgetting who held the needle while the town debated its font.\n\nAnd I thought of my mother, which is to say I thought of the way she would squint at the stitch and nod and then, because she knew a seam alone is not a garment, pick up the other piece and ask me to hold the far edge while she made a join that could stand a season.",

                              "content": "Chapter 10\n\nSunday arrived pretending to be kind. The sky had that pale, freshly laundered look that makes even bad siding on old houses look intentional. Pecan leaves held still like a congregation caught mid-breath. I ironed a shirt I had no business ironing because the cloth didn\u2019t deserve heat and care that early in the week, but some mornings you need to do something with a hot plate and a stubborn crease to make the rest of the day believe you can finish it. My mother\u2019s quilt looked restful on the chair, sage and russet and three squares that never quite match because she\u2019d run out of one print and refused to pretend the replacement had always been the plan. When the coffee went from impatient steam to something like a ceremony, my phone buzzed with messages that made a small, nervous music on the counter. Aimee: wear a jacket with inside pockets and do not say you\u2019ll give it to me later because you won\u2019t. Pil: parade starts at two, I\u2019ve got a spot by the bandstand, keep your metaphors to what fits between a drumroll and a sponsor mention. Sloan: the janitor is a saint; if the weather holds I\u2019ll set up in the rotunda after the thing with the floats. Lorraine: press conference noon; state will speak like a grown-up; bring one copy of everything that makes you feel taller.\n\nMeridian\u2019s Founders\u2019 Day parade has always been more confession than celebration. We line up our tractors not because we need to but because we like to see if the paint still shines; we put our middle schoolers in matching T-shirts so they can practice the synchronized embarrassment that will take them into high school; the churches build floats with themes that would make you blush if you had time to think about where the glue came from. The warehouse men sponsor the water table, and the tablecloth always has their logo repeating like a wallpaper pattern in a room you don\u2019t get to sit down in. This year there was a banner stitched by the quilting circle that had been mended so well you wouldn\u2019t have seen the seam unless a woman raised you right pointed it out. Miss Laverne stood under it in a shirt with more starch than a principled apology and gave orders with a chin you could have measured your courage against.\n\nJoy wore a headband no one would accuse of being practical. The fuzz had declared itself hair sometime between Friday morning and Saturday night, and she had decided, with that meticulous mercy she gives herself on good days, to let it be seen and not just touched by hands that ask permission. Darla wore a dress with pockets because I had promised to bring her a pen that doesn\u2019t run and soup; she had found the pockets and put her hands in like a woman choosing not to be argued with. Earl had folded the parade route map and placed it inside his back pocket and then pulled it out and put it back in until the crease remembered where it belonged. Elise stood near the church float with a pair of scissors in her cardigan pocket and a look that said if anybody pulled a thread they hadn\u2019t earned, she knew how to cut a man\u2019s metaphor in half.\n\nBefore the parade, the courthouse steps filled with the kind of crowd that shows up for free water and breaks for justice when it\u2019s offered. Lorraine didn\u2019t take the mic; that\u2019s not her show. The state\u2019s lawyer with the neat part and the low voice stood with a poster-board of bullet points that had never felt more like ammunition and said, without ceremony, that Auxiliary Logistics had been \u201cdissolved under scrutiny,\u201d that sealed boxes had become open questions, that a procurement manager had entered a plea to something with the kind of consonants people pretend not to hear, and that donors do not cure scarcity by inventing it. She kept the nouns close together and let the verbs do their work. When she finished, no one clapped. Meridian doesn\u2019t applaud announcements the way cities do. We let the words sit and see if they start to smell like truth when the day warms them a little.\n\nThe ambush, of course, came with a smile. It always does, because men who train their faces to sell you a refrigerator in winter do not unlearn the softness that keeps you from slamming the door. He wore a volunteer sash that let him approach any body with a clipboard and a bottle of water. He called me Barry like we were cousins and handed me a manila folder with a label in a font I know too well to trust. The other hand held an identical folder for Darla. \u201cJust so you\u2019re informed,\u201d he said, and glanced toward the photographers who had discovered the angle of a lawsuit looks prettier than a promise when you\u2019re trying to make a front page behave. I didn\u2019t look at the camera, because my mother would have scolded me with her eyebrows and told me to read before I performed.\n\nThe complaint called us wicked names in courteous language. Defamation and interference and a fanciful paragraph about \u201cmisappropriation of institutional goodwill\u201d that made me want to iron the strip of paper it was printed on until the letters begged for mercy and promised to behave. They had cut Joy\u2019s parents into the suit like a seam you add last minute when you realize the garment won\u2019t hang; they wore the words \u201cconspiracy of public confusion\u201d and I felt Earl\u2019s breath go wrong even through three feet of air. He is a man who pretends not to care what the town says about him until the town says it loud enough for the girls to hear. Darla didn\u2019t flinch; she took the pages with the same hand she uses to hold a vein steady and slid them into the pocket I\u2019d admired. \u201cWe have a parade,\u201d she said to the volunteer. \u201cYou have a conscience. Let\u2019s see which of us can find what we need first.\u201d\n\nWhen I looked up, Sloan was already moving toward the courthouse. He has cultivated a stillness lately, but on certain days he remembers motion is permissible for men who intend to be decent. He didn\u2019t touch my arm and I didn\u2019t need him to. In the rotunda, he set his keyboard where men used to set petitions and played the thing he refuses to title that makes my chest decide to behave for a full two minutes. People drifted from floats and water stations and the edges of their own intentions and let the sound remind their faces what they would like to believe they look like. The warehouse men stood under the second-floor rail the way owls pretend to be part of architecture. One adjusted his cuff again; one checked his phone like phones absolve us from having to check our hearts.\n\nLorraine\u2019s press conference did what it owed. It gave people a sentence to say at lunch that does not make them sound like they slept through the morning. \u201cThe state secured warrants\u201d works in almost any conversation if you season it with a good side-eye. It also let the hospital rehearse a statement in which they used the phrase \u201cisolated administrative lapses\u201d and \u201cunforeseen downstream effects\u201d and a paragraph about \u201cthe importance of patient-centered care\u201d that would have sat better if it hadn\u2019t been announced by a man whose pencil line hair and clean fingertips made me think of how careful he must be not to get real ink on anything. Pil took to the airwaves with that delighted sobriety he reserves for days when he gets to say the word accountability without having to use the words allegedly and forthcoming. He called me live and asked for a sentence he could fit before the citrus farm ad, and I said, \u201cWe learned to carry a file box like a baby and it paid off,\u201d and he groaned and said he would edit my metaphors in post and keep the baby.\n\nThe parade went on because towns do not cancel tradition for truth; they carry both and get shin splints. The high school band tried to march in a straight line down a street that refuses to be honest about its width. The Shriners did their little car ballet that shapes a figure eight so pretty you forget half the drivers are accountants who cry at the price of wood. A float sponsored by a chain pharmacy had an oversized pill bottle painted with a smile that would have unsettled me on any other day; today it felt like a fairytale eaten by an after-school special. The church banner sailed past with its mended hem daring any camera to zoom and find the stitch. Elise walked beside it holding a stick with the calm of a woman who has been asked to steady men all her life and has chosen, finally, to let the fabric do some of its own work.\n\nThe ambush\u2019s second act stepped out of a white tent with pastries. A boy in a polo with a logo that had not existed last week offered Joy\u2019s mother a check the way you offer a woman a chair when she isn\u2019t sure if she\u2019s allowed to sit. \u201cA family assistance gift,\u201d he said, and pretended not to notice the photographers doing their good-citizen crouch. The number was too round to be nice. Darla looked at the paper like it was a stain on a tablecloth she had just laundered. Earl\u2019s mouth flattened and his hand went toward his back pocket and then stopped because the map was there and maps are for directions, not for fists.\n\n\u201cYou can refuse money without refusing people,\u201d Darla said to nobody in particular and everybody in earshot. She is better than I am at saying the sentence you want the town to repeat instead of the one it will. Joy took the check, folded it in half without looking at the amount, handed it to her mother, and said, with the easy teenage cruelty that saves lives when it is correctly applied, \u201cYou can mail them a thank-you from the future when I\u2019m done needing it.\u201d Her mother smiled the tight smile of a woman who will accept a kind that isn\u2019t clean only to change it into clean later in the kitchen with a pair of scissors and a stamp and the good pen.\n\nI took Darla\u2019s stack of pages into the shade and skimmed while the marching girls did a routine that made my knees hurt in sympathy. The suit had been filed in a county friendlier to glossy folders than to quilts. It was signed by a firm from a city that sells glass for a living. It wanted to enjoin our tongues and wrists and computers and the path from the pharmacy loading bay to the street. It wanted to erase Elise with a red pen and to put Lorraine in a box labeled Overstep. It named Oakes because they needed a musician to make the story less about women who sew. Mrs. Hale, who somehow knows when the air goes sour in any building that keeps paper, texted that she was in her office with a pot of tea and two kinds of response already half-written, and to bring my face and not my feelings.\n\nBy the time the parade thinned into children dragging plastic sacks with five peppermints and a pocket handful of heat, the ambush had softened into neighborliness again. Men who had shouted my name in the morning nodded as if seeing me in public had made me less likely to be an idea they disagreed with. Sloan finished his impromptu concert without bowing and without begging the crowd for anything more than air. He stayed seated for a long moment, hands on his thighs, eyes on the keyboard like a man reading a letter he knows he will keep in the same drawer as his father\u2019s watch. When he looked up, the room had the sweet awkwardness of a gathering that doesn\u2019t know if it just witnessed something sacred or secular and would like to be told how to behave. He did not instruct them. He put his bench under one arm and carried the keyboard out like a man who had never been allowed to move furniture and had finally decided to lift his share without asking permission.\n\nAt Mrs. Hale\u2019s, the light through the old glass windows made a warp on the floor that seemed designed to catch bad arguments where they might trip. She read the complaint the way she reads a menu\u2014curious, decisive, refusing to be intimidated by adjectives. \u201cWe can\u2019t anti-SLAPP our way out of this in this state,\u201d she said, handing me a clipping from a law journal she keeps to remind herself which neighbors have nicer tools, \u201cbut we can cut away the parts that want to be costume and leave them in their underwear long enough to embarass the men who dressed them up.\u201d We drafted something that smelled like calm and carried inside it a small, sharp thing that would nick anyone who tried to hold it too hard. She told me when to breathe. She told me which sentences would make me look like a man who talks to himself in the mirror and which would make me look like a man you could hand a baby to and go find a towel. She took the check from Joy\u2019s mother, which had found its way to my pocket like all hot things do, and said, \u201cWe will endorse it to a fund. We will put six names on the account. We will not allow one man to put a hand on a girl\u2019s head and call it generosity.\u201d\n\nWe filed. We walked the papers to the clerk with our elbows in the right kind of angle. Out in the hall, the warehouse man with the immaculate smile offered me something approximating a grin and said, \u201cYou have a fine day, Barrett,\u201d in a tone that meant he had decided to move from threats to politeness because the cameras had rested. I told him to put sunscreen on the tips of his ears because the sun had become unkind, and he touched his ear involuntarily the way men are taught not to, and for an instant he looked as human as anyone I know. It is hard to stay angry at a face you have persuaded into checking whether it is burning.\n\nThe hospital moved like an organism trying out a new gait. An internal memo admitted to \u201cunhelpful enthusiasm\u201d in procurement, which is the sort of phrase men who want to stay employed write when they have learned nothing and wish to confess it with their wrists. Darla\u2019s privileges were reinstated in a way that would play well in a hearing, a partial keycard, access to the floors with patient names she could conjure in her sleep, and a little note in the system that said See admin for special protocols, which is how you apologize in a building where apology looks like a workflow. She stood in the lobby with her hands in her pockets and let herself be scanned back into a place that had made a theater of pushing her out. The guard who used to bring the cupcakes from his wife nodded like a man who had made the cupcakes himself and had been told he had done a fair job. She took the elevator and the lights did their polite ascending, and when the doors opened on a floor she had missed more than she had allowed, she did not cry. She adjusted a cuff. She caught sight of a nurse she\u2019d trained when that woman was still flinching at needles, and they picked up an old conversation without fuss.\n\nJoy asked, on Monday, to go to school for one hour. It was a request that arrived like a shoe thrown at a door in an otherwise well-behaved day. The principal had been practicing sorrow for weeks in the mirror and had gotten good enough to frighten her own dog; she said yes with a flurry of forms and a note to teachers that had too many adverbs in it. I walked Joy in because Earl had used up his courage on the parade. The hallway air had that institutional chill that promises fairness until the thermostat breaks. A girl in a sweatshirt with the sleeves cut off and a headband that took no prisoners hugged Joy and then stood back and said, \u201cYour head is trying to beat mine,\u201d which is the kind of compliment you keep for days when you need to remember girls will save us if we let them. A teacher put a hand out for a paper that didn\u2019t exist and then found the right hand and put it on Joy\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cBe bored,\u201d which is, I have discovered, one of the holiest blessings we have.\n\nOn the way back to the truck, a boy with the posture of someone who will be handsome when he is tired waved a copy of the local paper and asked if I really had sued the hospital. I told him I had sued nobody and asked the court to remind adults what the word hurry means. He said he liked the word spry better and I agreed and told him to teach it to his grandfather. He said his grandfather would not listen and then laughed and said he would try anyway because men who don\u2019t like to be instructed like to be argued with if you make it feel like a game.\n\nThe suit did not slow the pilot Lorraine had dressed in such decent language it could survive in any climate. Carrow called from Jackson to say the committee that will not call itself a committee had been scheduled for Tuesday in a room with plastic chairs that pretended not to squeak. The registry had teeth and a small whistle attached for emergencies. They had printed badges not because the work required them but because the work wanted to feel like a club it could justify. Darla asked me to check the language on a consent form that had been written by a person with a clean conscience and a bad ear. I took my pen and made the words ordinary enough to belong in a kitchen. We added a line about what to do if a woman changed her mind and a paragraph about where to put your fear if you didn\u2019t want to wear it in your face all day. The administrator in the room looked grateful and then troubled because gratitude feels like treason in some rooms. She took her troubled face outside and came back with sugar cookies.\n\nElise and the quilt ladies devised a protection scheme that would not make the papers because it did not involve men. They decided whose porches would be watched by which women after which choir practice. They traded recipes with instructions like code. Bring the cassava to L\u2019s at nine meant somebody had seen the car with the tint that didn\u2019t belong. They tucked extra needles into pockets because a woman carrying a needle cannot be accused of violence by anyone who can be shamed. They watched the service at the other church on the corner online and counted heads and frowned when a new head did not bow at the right words. Elise brought me a pie with a crust that flaked like a good memory and told me without looking at me that when she dies she wants lyrics on her bulletin that the men do not know so their mouths will move without sound for once and we will see what that looks like on their faces.\n\nThe warehouse men did not idle. Someone with nimble fingers and a willingness to work in the dark turned off the breaker to my sign and left the fuse box door hanging open like a dare. Aimee put a sticky note on it that said Close your own door and taped it shut with blue painter\u2019s tape because she does not believe in leaving residue anyone else will have to scrub. Boone called to say a man had tried to pay for antibiotics in cash that smelled like shared pockets and he had sent him away with dewormer because Boone believes men who lie to feed stores should at least have the courtesy to care for their animals. Mrs. Hale told me to sleep on the couch in my office with my jacket under my head if I intended to stay late drafting, because she had read too many books in which men fall asleep in chairs and die and she did not intend to attend two funerals in a season.\n\nWhen the AG\u2019s first set of charges were read publicly, I did not feel triumph. I felt the way your hands feel when you have just finally loosened a knot that came from a bad habit; relief edged by the knowledge you tied it yourself somewhere along the way by letting things be tidy that shouldn\u2019t have been. A bookkeeper cried in a way that suggests he had been waiting to cry at something innocuous and had decided to allow himself this. A donor put out a statement written by a person who uses old words like steward in new places because they sound ancestral and forgets that stewardship requires sheep. Lorraine sent two words to my phone\u2014Keep going\u2014and I looked at them longer than I needed to because I needed to look at something short that felt correct.\n\nBuckley\u2019s sisters sent voice notes because their hands were busy with hair. One had sat behind him on the couch and braided while the other read a short story out loud she had found on the internet that would have been awful if she\u2019d had taste but was perfect because she did not. He laughed in the right places, which is medicine we have not bottled. He slept two nights in a row, which is grace we do not get to schedule. When Darla went out with a cooler and a legal pad and the name of a vet who will forever be excused from one small lie on his taxes, she came back with a look that was neither saintly nor smug. \u201cHe is getting tired in the way that looks like health when your body remembers how to be wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cHe yelled at a sister because she salted the green beans before she tasted and then apologized and that apology was the most alive thing I have held in a week.\u201d\n\nToward the end of the week, I found on my chair not a bear but a tailor\u2019s tape, the soft cloth kind, the numbers dark and honest. It was the sort of tape you use when you agree that bodies change and you will not punish them for it. Someone had scratched out two numbers in the thirties and replaced them with three and four but in handwriting that looked like a child\u2019s. There was no note. The tape did not smell of smoke or glue; it smelled like a drawer and a hand. I unrolled it on my desk and laid it next to a pleading and the tin of my mother\u2019s needles and the sandwich Aimee had put there without asking if I had eaten. The tape lay in a curve that made the paperwork kinder by proximity. I coiled it back up and put it with the red thread like a small pledge to a craft I had not admitted I practiced in public.\n\nThat night, Meridian performed weather that could have turned either way. The river held its manners. The trees gestured and then decided unison wasn\u2019t necessary. Oakes sat in the doorway of the repair shop that would be a music school soon and tuned something small while a boy in a Spider-Man shirt watched with a concentration you cannot teach. Sloan, from his rented room, texted a picture of a bare wall with a nail in it and wrote, \u201cI could hang the degree or the song,\u201d and I wrote back, \u201cHang the thing that makes your son point.\u201d He sent a photo of the boy\u2019s hand, open and messy, and then a voice note of him whistling the stubborn little tune I have stopped trying to name. I sat on the steps of the office under an untrustworthy bulb and let the sound try the air, and for once the air did not argue.\n\nOn Sunday evening, after we had carried coolers and boxes and words back to their shelves, after the suit had been answered with paper that felt less like a shield than a scarf, after Lorraine had told me in three sentences what a week of governance would cost her and I had promised her a pie I had no right to promise, I walked home under a sky that had decided to try on pink. The town made the little noises it makes when it thinks nobody is paying attention\u2014ice maker chokes and then relents, neighbor laughs at a show with a line a woman wrote who has never been here, dog barks twice in a register that says he knows every car that belongs. In my kitchen, I spread my mother\u2019s quilt over the table because the wood had begun to seem insufficient, and I took the tape into my hands and pulled it without thinking from zero to twenty-three. The fabric gave under my fingers and then did not, and I remembered how she would snap it against my wrist when she wanted me to stop fidgeting and then kiss the place the snap had marked for an hour. I put the tape down and laughed out loud because the world had gotten away with something, and for once I did not immediately try to name it.\n\nOn Monday morning, the courthouse smelled the way wood smells when it forgives you for leaning against it, and the clerk looked at me like a man she had decided would sit when instructed and talk when allowed and not take the pen she offers home in his pocket. We had work and we did not call it a battle because it isn\u2019t one if you know where your sewing kit is. A boy with a mop who had been taught to move quietly stopped when he saw the red thread around our evidence box and asked if we needed more tape. I told him we needed less fear. He said he could get us a sandwich, and I told him he had understood something better than half the attorneys I have stood next to under stained glass and pretended to admire. He smiled and went back to practicing his straight lines. He will leave this town or he will stay and make it better. I am trying, this week, to be the kind of man who lets either of those decisions be the right one.\n\nBy afternoon, our pilot-that-is-not had sprouted a schedule with names that tasted like real people instead of case numbers: Joy and Buckley and Mrs. Ludwig who does not own cattle but knows men with feed stores, and two women from across the river whose church has not decided whether we are an ethical experiment or an unpunished wish. The trucks arrived without fuss and were unloaded by men who had found a different rhythm than the one that lets you stack boxes and forget the names on the labels belong to breath. Someone taped a note on the pharmacy breakroom refrigerator that said, \u201cTake one. Take care. Tell me if you can\u2019t,\u201d and it was unsigned and in a hand I will spend a long time trying to place.\n\nWe are not done. I know that because the suit exists and because men who have been embarrassed late are more dangerous than men who have been forgiven early. I know it because the tape on my desk can be coiled wrong and left in a drawer and forgotten while other hands lift other measurements and call them fair. But on this particular evening, the town felt mended in a way that did not lie about its rips. Joy sat on her porch and ate a popsicle during the hour the mosquito trucks are supposed to save us and never do, hair stubborn and eyebrows having remembered their job; Earl listened to a song he did not understand the words to twice and nodded both times as if he owed the music respect even if it never paid it back; Darla stood in the doorway of a room she had been uninvited from and made a note on a chart with her good pen; Sloan taught a man who owns a renting business how to make his left hand jealous of his right; Elise put her scissors in a drawer and sat with her feet up like a queen whose throne has the low back of a kitchen chair and a cushion that\u2019s lost its plump.\n\nI turned out the lights in the office and left the sign off on purpose. The street had enough brightness in other windows to carry me home without a stumble. On my table, the tape lay where I\u2019d left it, and I put my hand on it like a man taking an oath nobody asked him to make and said, out loud because the room had earned it, that I would keep what\u2019s inside inside until the day came when letting it out would save more than it might ruin. Then I laughed again at myself and at the town and at the way a piece of cloth with numbers on it can feel like a future, and I slept under my mother\u2019s quilt with the ribbon of the fan\u2019s click counting us through the night like a metronome that has decided the song will hold even if the measure goes a little long.",
