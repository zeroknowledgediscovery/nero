     "novel_text": "The first warm southerly of the year rose off Corio Bay with a taste of steel and lemon, teasing the water into fish-scale brightness and chasing whitecaps around the curve of Eastern Beach. On the pier, boys and grown men tried to pretend that the breeze was colder than it was. A chilly day, mate. Bracing. That old bluff. Heat makes people honest and they didn\u2019t want it yet.\n\nKip perched on the rail of Cunningham Pier and watched the wind invent itself. He was a small, wiry thing even by sprite standards, the color of eucalyptus bark and salt. The paint from the famous bollards didn\u2019t stain him anymore\u2014he had learned how to tilt his edges, how to let matter pass through him like a harmless ribbon\u2014but he still liked to rest his bare feet on their flat tops and imagine being tall and wooden and heavy, nailed into the earth.\n\n\u201cYou going to help or just sit there like a gull?\u201d Tansy called up from the deck of a fishing boat below. She had stuck a cigarette behind one ear and a pencil behind the other and kept grabbing the wrong one.\n\nKip turned upside down just because he could. He hung by the knees, hair falling in his eyes, and grinned at her. \u201cI\u2019m watching the physics.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe physics is a knot in my net. If you want to study that? Come down.\u201d\n\nHe dropped, a clean weightless fall that ended with one hand on the boat\u2019s rail and a soundless flick to bring his feet beneath him. The other sprite aboard, a glassy, jittering kid from the Barwon named Jet, widened her eyes until they flashed like a minnow. Humans never saw the drop. They saw a flicker, a man who had always been there.\n\n\u201cShow off,\u201d Tansy said. She was a rivergrass sprite who had chosen to grow into human shape most days because it got her better tips at the caf\u00e9 when she needed them, and because wearing boots and a hoodie kept her warm. Her voice had the rasp of winter frogs.\n\nKip lifted the net and breathed on it. Stray fish scales glowed like moons. Then he lifted again, pulling the threads apart in a peculiar pattern: up-over, under-twist, swap-two. All magic was pattern. All magic was naming the shape of the problem and then making a different one under its feet. His fingertips left a silver damp that sizzled where it touched sun.\n\nJet watched his hands. \u201cHow do you do that thing with the twist?\u201d she blurted. \u201cYou can see where the net is going to break, can\u2019t you? Before it happens.\u201d\n\n\u201cI listen,\u201d Kip said. He didn\u2019t move his mouth when he said it, didn\u2019t say it at all, really; he breathed the words into the woven threads and let the net repeat them. \u201cThey complain. They\u2019re old. They want to talk about all the fish they\u2019ve held.\u201d\n\nTansy rolled her eyes. \u201cThat is not listening. That is being strange. Hold your own end, Jet. There. You\u2014Kip\u2014where were you last night? You missed the meeting at the old woolstores. Aunt Beryl made a cake the size of a wheel, and when Aunt Beryl bakes cake you come, unless you want to be hexed so your ears ring for a month.\u201d\n\nKip made a face. \u201cThe woolstores make my teeth hurt.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything makes your teeth hurt,\u201d Tansy said. \u201cMoonlight on water, the taste of metal, somebody playing bagpipes three streets away.\u201d\n\n\u201cBagpipes should make everyone\u2019s teeth hurt,\u201d Kip said without heat. \u201cI was down by the river. Mending. Practicing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and your practicing,\u201d Tansy said, but there was fondness in it. \u201cOne day you\u2019re going to practice so hard you bend yourself into a knot and no one will be able to tell where your head is. Aunt Beryl says you should save that for when you\u2019re a hundred and have to tie your own beard over your nose.\u201d\n\nKip made a knot with two fingers and let it pour away like water.\n\nThe wind shifted. It came over the old Balmoral Hotel, over the brick warehouses that remembered sheep and grease. Over the silos. It came with a smell.\n\nKip\u2019s head snapped up. He didn\u2019t move otherwise, not even breath. The smell was not strong. That would come later, if it came at all. This was a ghost of a smell. The idea of it. Old meat wrapped in plastic and left behind a bin, that kind of look-away reek. A hospital drain on a warm day. Not quite there. Not yet.\n\nTansy kept talking. \u201cJet, put your finger there. No, further. He\u2014Kip\u2014there is a smell, isn\u2019t there. I can always tell when you\u2019re not listening.\u201d\n\nJet wrinkled her small pointed nose. \u201cUgh. That again? Cousin Birdie said she saw a stain under Prince\u2019s Bridge last night. A moving stain.\u201d\n\nKip swallowed a word that wasn\u2019t for public. \u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cDownriver,\u201d Jet said. \u201cNear the woollen mills. Like an oil slick. But in the air.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you told Aunt Beryl? The Anchor?\u201d\n\n\u201cTold everyone,\u201d Tansy said. \u201cEveryone tells everyone. That\u2019s the fun. I think it\u2019s made up. Probably a fox again. Or one of those homeless humans who eats out of bins and smells like it. Poor things. Don\u2019t go anxious at it.\u201d\n\nKip shook his head. Tansy liked explanations you could poke with a stick. This was not one of those. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t eat out of bins,\u201d he said, quiet now, too quiet. \u201cIt eats fear. It drinks what runs under the streets and it likes to chew on the bruise of a thing that used to be living.\u201d\n\nJet stared at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen it?\u201d\n\nKip thought of the night six months ago when he had set fog along the rocks in a pattern too complicated even for him to like. He had called for something with long fingers and it had come, laughing, because he had made a door and left it open. The taste in the air after had been like a dead bird in summer. He had woken up at Eastern Park with mud in his hair and no blood in his left hand; it drifted for hours, as if it had forgotten how to be flesh.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen its shadow,\u201d he said. \u201cKeep mending. Please.\u201d\n\nTansy shut her mouth on a dozen questions. She finished the net while Kip held and Jet fussed and the men talked footy behind them, arguing about the Cats with the same old comfortable rumbles. The smell faded. The wind went back to lemon and steel.\n\nLater, when the sun had leaned itself onto the water and started stretching, Kip walked the promenade in a pair of borrowed boots. He liked shoes when he wanted to feel the ground in a dull way. Socks were harder. Socks made him irritable. The bollards watched him go past; their painted eyes didn\u2019t move, but he felt the tacky hum of old attention.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re sniffing for it,\u201d said a dry voice, \u201cyou won\u2019t smell it with ocean on your lip.\u201d\n\nKip stopped and turned toward a woman sitting on a bench, her hair like iron filings and her skin full of lines, every one of them earned. Humans would have said she was a woman in her seventies with a glint like broken glass. Sprites saw the keels of ships carved into her shoulders, an anchor at the base of her throat like a brand, the iron taste of ballast and the cotton-lanolin stink of wool half a century old. The Anchor did not bother to hide what she was. She never had.\n\n\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d Kip said. He stood straight, because you did that for her. You didn\u2019t slouch when you were pointed at by the history of the bay.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t good afternoon me,\u201d she said, but she smiled. \u201cYou missed cake.\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard,\u201d he said, because he had. Aunt Beryl had made a cake, and the Anchor had probably sat with her big kind hands behind her big cold eyes and eaten twice her share for politeness, then gone down to the water and spat in it for balance. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been practicing,\u201d the Anchor said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been practicing where you shouldn\u2019t. Don\u2019t argue. The river told me. It tells me everything. It is indiscreet.\u201d\n\nKip stared at his boots. The leather had softened around his toes. He wrinkled them, then stilled when the Anchor raised an eyebrow.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s here again,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re calling it Rankin this time, I think. They like to make names. It makes the shapeless feel like you can put it in a bottle and label it. Fools.\u201d\n\nKip repeated the name silently. Rankin. The word tasted of rusted nails and wet wool. A local name for a not-local thing. \u201cYou\u2019ve fought it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the Anchor said. She stretched, the bench creaking under her. \u201cWe pushed the last one out when they cleaned the drains for the Commonwealth Games. The engineers did it and didn\u2019t even know they had. Now look. Twenty years of plastic, and lazy rain, and men who pour old fat down their sinks. Now look. The city hums with its kind of happiness. Of course it came. Of course. Moss grows in shade. Rot goes where you leave it a corner. Sprite, don\u2019t go alone.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. He wanted to say hope is moss too. It grows if you leave it a corner. Silly.\n\n\u201cThere are other smart ones,\u201d she said. \u201cBeryl. That boy who listens to screws and thinks he\u2019s old. The stone aunties under the You Yangs. They\u2019ll help. And you. You are too clever for your own bones. Don\u2019t let that be the death of you.\u201d\n\nKip gave a lopsided smile. \u201cI can be very stupid if that helps.\u201d\n\nThe Anchor rapped her knuckles on the bench; the sound was like a hammer on a hull. \u201cIt won\u2019t. Go see the bath at Eastern Beach. They say the water curdled when a child waded this morning. They say the child cried and vomited and her father called CHOICES and then forget what he saw. It can do that. It can make your brain go cloudlike. Remember your shape. Keep a thread to your own elbow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always keep a thread,\u201d he said, and felt in his pocket for the loop of braided seagrass he had kept since he was a child, when Aunt Beryl braided everything and he collected the ends. He kept a thread to his own elbow. He hummed to himself because he always did, and the tune made itself from wave and gull and joke.\n\n\u201cSomething has been humming you back lately,\u201d the Anchor said, not unkindly. \u201cGo on.\u201d\n\nHe went.\n\nIt is a city that leaves things lying around for stories to trip over. Wrecks in the bay. Brick walls half falling down, graffiti that had intelligence and then didn\u2019t. There were still rabbits in gardens. Sun fell through the lattice at the pavilion and made a charade of shadows. People ate chips too fast because of the seagulls and then fed the gulls when they thought nobody was watching. Human ritual.\n\nThe gentle steps down into the sea bath were slick with a translucent green that wasn\u2019t quite seaweed and wasn\u2019t really not. Kip put his bare feet down, one after the other, held the rail, went slow. He could walk on water. That wasn\u2019t the point. There were better respects than that.\n\nUna, the human lifeguard with forearms like a history lesson and tattoos of octopuses on both calves, lifted a hand when she recognized him. She did not think he was human. She didn\u2019t think about what he was. She thought about his help when the boy went under last summer and floated back up with his mouth full of congratulations. She thought about that and decided the rest could be sorted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not right,\u201d she said, just like that. \u201cIt feels like milk that went off three hot days ago and someone keeps pushing it through the tap out there and hoping we don\u2019t notice.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not milk,\u201d Kip said. He dipped his fingers into the bath, or rather let the bath dip itself into him. \u201cIt wants you to think it\u2019s that. It wants your nose to be ordinary.\u201d\n\nUna rubbed her forearms, then stopped, annoyed at herself for being unsettled. \u201cWe had three old ducks complain they could taste beef when they swam. That\u2019s not a thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is someone\u2019s thing,\u201d Kip said absently. He had the shape of it, now. He could taste the thin membranes between what the water remembered and what the water had to do. The bath remembered babies who had learned to float here, men who had taught themselves to breathe that way again, women who had come with the softest smiles and no one who would not let them swim in the ocean and had sunk and risen, sunk and risen, slowly, on a rope.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing? Is that safe?\u201d Una asked.\n\n\u201cNothing is safe,\u201d Kip said. \u201cListen with me.\u201d\n\nUna snorted. \u201cIt\u2019s your head. Try not to blow up.\u201d\n\nHe closed his eyes and put both hands on the surface, pressing down until the skin of the water curved and held him like a drum. The song he used was old and silly\u2014when Aunt Beryl taught him it, she had used it to make the washing up go faster\u2014but it had a good beat and a sideways joke in it that slid under sorrow and lifted it up. He hummed, and the bath shivered, and his breath came back with a taste like pennies.\n\nSomething pushed into him, friendly as a cat, and something else tugged at his hair with childish cruelty. He let it. A kite tried to fly out of his shoulder blade and he anchored it with a thought. The smell rose with the first bright ring of song, bright and then not. It should have dissipated in the wind, should have run out into the bay and gone thin. But a curl of it stuck low over the water, clinging.\n\nHe had a moment\u2019s double vision: the bath and his breath and the rail and also a black tube that carried night, not water. The rail became a rib, the steps became teeth, Una turned her head and the tattoo on her calf unspooled into label, expense, glue.\n\nHe blinked and the weirdness snapped back into its box. He knew that box. It was not supposed to open on its own.\n\n\u201cIt likes to hide in corners,\u201d he said, and his voice wasn\u2019t quite as even as he hoped. He pulled his hands up and water came with them for an extra heartbeat, clinging like a skin that didn\u2019t want to be left behind. He made a little circle in the air with his finger and the piece that stuck broke down, fell in a rush.\n\nUna watched the wet trickle down into the bath. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d he said, which was the oldest lie in any language. \u201cWhere did the child get sick?\u201d\n\nUna pointed. He walked that way, ankle deep, turned three times in a row, once slowly, and sang a different kind of nothing. Luck is not a joke but you can tell it as one. The smell, such as it had been, cast up again, thin as paper. He touched it with one careful knuckle.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you want to be a story that stops here or keeps going?\u201d\n\nA bump, childish-emphatic. Keeps. Goes.\n\nHe tried a trick Aunt Beryl hated. He made himself small inside his own head, very small, a single curled-finger sized thing, and sent that thing out through his hand into the smell. It slid under him with ease. It felt like grease with sand in it. It felt like chewing for too long. For an instant he knew the joy of rot, the relief it carried: end of responsibility, end of shape, end of needing to hold anything together. He wanted it. A little.\n\nHe cut the wanting off with a hard sharp thought, the kind that had saved him, more than once, from being a puddle of someone else\u2019s idea. He withdrew; the bit of him that had gone out came back with salt all over it that hadn\u2019t been there, and he had to sneeze. Seven times.\n\nUna, who had seen stranger things, pretended not to be alarmed. \u201cBless you. Stop there before the city runs out of polite.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone,\u201d he said, although they both knew that was bravado. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t like to be seen. It will leave when you look.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see it?\u201d Una asked.\n\n\u201cI see the space it likes,\u201d Kip said. \u201cI\u2019ll sweep out the corners. You can help by telling everyone it\u2019s nothing. It feeds on fear. It wants us all a little tired.\u201d\n\nUna narrowed her eyes. \u201cPeople always want me to tell other people things. The trouble with everyone is everyone else.\u201d\n\nHe laughed, and the bath let him laugh, and for a minute there were no black tubes in the back of his eyes.\n\nLater, though, back at the breakwater, the smell came again. Stronger. Kip tried to ignore it, tried to be ordinary, to sit on the rocks and watch the ferries and let his mind simple itself. The You Yangs to the west sat like sleeping animals. The bay was very blue. It was late enough that the gulls had given up their aggressive shift and were starting to beg instead.\n\nThe wind told a secret: drains. He stood. His boots were waiting on one rock. He left them. He walked past the carousel and past the fish and chip shops, past the small night things that only moved when no one was looking, past a teenager practicing skateboard tricks on the smooth concrete and swearing Monday-words every time he missed. The stormwater grates along the road all had eyes. He knew their names if he wanted to. He had named some of them as a boy: Gerald, Beige, Ow.\n\nUnder the bridge the air tasted like time hadn\u2019t noticed humans had invented plastic. He ducked without needing to, slid sideways through a space the size of a letter slot, and walked on into the kind of dark that had weight.\n\nHe hadn\u2019t told anyone. He never told anyone when he did this. He would tell them after he had done it; he could make it into a story then and control its edges. Kip walked to the slow music of his own bones and made small lights from the edges of his fingers. The lights called moths that weren\u2019t moths, made of dust and old sentences. He loved them. He stepped lightly. Once he slipped and his toe went into something that dissolved under it. He pulled his foot back and felt memory try to pull him along. He kept his thread at his elbow. He touched the loop of braided seagrass in his pocket and spoke a nonsense to it: stay. stay. stay with me. don\u2019t do that thing. stay.\n\nHe heard the smell before he felt it. No, wrong way round. He smelled sound. He tasted a chord that wasn\u2019t music and that bent the hair on his arms backwards so that each hair shouted. There was a voice in it and he recognized the shape of that voice. He froze, not because fear but because recognition, and he wished he could walk backwards in time six breaths and go back to when he didn\u2019t know a thing he was about to know.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he asked, because he was conventional in danger.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d said the voice, and it came from everywhere and nowhere, and it was not a whisper and not a shout. It sounded as if a mouth were too full and trying anyway. The smell flared, a bright slick heavy with a sweetness that was not a flavor and not a promise.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very clever,\u201d Kip said, to keep it light. \u201cWe\u2019re all there for ourselves. Philosophically. You sound like a book trying to be heard over traffic.\u201d\n\nSomething moved just at the edge of his light and then moved again closer. There was nothing to look at, and then there was too much. Kip\u2019s light showed the glitter of a wrapper, the curve of an old bottle, a thread of hair that might have belonged to a person or to a rope, and underneath it all a deepen in the air as if it were sagging under a weight you couldn\u2019t see. He did not, would not, focus his eyes on the place where it seemed thickest. He\u2019d learned that the hard way with mirror-water. He looked aside.\n\n\u201cKip,\u201d said the voice. It said his name. It said his name as if it had invented it.\n\nHe made his own voice practical because he had to. \u201cDid you make a child sick this morning?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly a little,\u201d said the voice. \u201cOnly enough to make them remember that bodies are bodies and that sometimes they fail. Only enough to teach this day to be long. A small lesson. There are worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are worse,\u201d he echoed. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I was hungry. I woke hungry,\u201d said the voice, as if that were the end of it. It sounded almost affronted that hunger wasn\u2019t sufficient explanation: the complaint of a winter cat.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t eat children,\u201d Kip said, gentle, slow. \u201cDon\u2019t eat ordinary days. Eat\u2026 the bad ends of things.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour days are ordinary?\u201d the voice said, and laughed. The smell went sharper, like the moment before meat goes from safe to risky. \u201cHow proud. How wrong. Ordinary is a word for not-me. I am ordinary. Heaps of me in bins. Heaps of me in drains. Heaps of me in all the boats you make and use until you leave them to rot then pretend they were something else first.\u201d\n\nKip felt his hands get cold. \u201cWho named you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d said the voice. \u201cYou smelled me and you hung a word on me, you thought you were a king with a label-maker. You named me Rankin because you wanted to make me as small as a human man who came and went. Names are for hope. So be hopeful. Name me again.\u201d\n\nThe lights on his fingertips guttered and surged. He could put out more light. He could blast this tunnel full of brightness so hard it ached. He could, but it would just show him the all of what he wasn\u2019t ready for, and anyway his kind of magic was not throwing. His kind was making. He took his hand off the pocket with the seagrass loop and counted the bones in his left foot instead, toe to ankle, because that was a map of being alive. He listened. The voice came from everywhere because the voice was inside as well as out.\n\nHe had heard his voice like this once before and not known it. He had taken something home that night it rained blood-brown mud from the paddocks. It had followed his breath in and had sat under his ribs and he had sung to it because he sang to everything. He had fed it his own tidy anger at careless humans and it had liked the taste so much it had grown teeth, slowly, gently. He had woke with grit on his tongue and thought it was dreams.\n\n\u201cChild,\u201d said the voice, no longer speaking as the drain. \u201cDummy. Friend. You have been eating me in middle-of-the-night spoonfuls for a season. And now you come here and talk like you\u2019re a river.\u201d\n\nKip bit the inside of his mouth and tasted iron. \u201cSo we know each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said the voice, and then it laughed in a different cadence\u2014a sound he had made when Tansy told a rude joke about a kitchen mop and a nun\u2014and the world slid five degrees sideways. He had a flash of how he must look from outside: a small figure in a black tunnel with his own green-white light haloing his fingers and eyes. He had a flash of his face reflected in black water. He also had a flash of not being a he. Of being the smell itself, a rope of air, a burn of acid, a surprised joy. He backed up one step and his heel bumped a bottle; the noise of it clacking along the tunnel was petty and bright and saved him.\n\n\u201cStop that,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t invite you in.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou made me,\u201d said the voice, tender like a knife. \u201cYou\u2019re the clever little moss that thinks moss has no enemies. Half your tricks are rot turned sideways. You decay what doesn\u2019t do and call it a charm. You ferment water to get rain. You\u2019re not a leaf-and-sun guy, Kip. You\u2019re a compost heap with a grin, and I love you for it. Come closer. Let\u2019s be the same again. It was so cold alone.\u201d\n\nHe heard the truth of it. He heard his own truth curved. He knew what he had done, in the smallest, and he had only himself to blame. He closed his eyes because that let him see better. He imagined his cells, all of them, sweetly sprung like kelp when a current lifts it. He let the current be the kind that warmed, not the cold that took fingers. He said the names of his own parts to himself: spleen, lung, brainstem, metatarsal. He said the name of his mother, who had been a blue ghost in the reeds, and his father, who had not been anything like human and had still come with soft gifts. He said the name of Aunt Beryl. Of Tansy. Of the Anchor and her hands that had been warm on his head when he was feverish once in summer. He said the name of stone. The You Yangs. He said Geelong like an oath and like a lullaby and like a rude word.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me your names,\u201d said the voice, impatient now. \u201cI know them. I own half of them. I wore them when you slept. You don\u2019t remember? Look at your fingers, smart boy.\u201d\n\nHe did. In his light, his fingers were clean. Under the nail of his left thumb there was a blackness as if he had caught dirt that wouldn\u2019t wash out. He scraped it with a tooth. The taste was old fat. He gagged and thought about laughing too hard to hide it. He was alone with a shape of himself and wanted to be the person who could sit down and talk.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t fair,\u201d he said, which was ridiculous. Nothing was fair. That had never stopped anyone.\n\n\u201cFair would be nothing eating anything,\u201d said the voice. \u201cFair would be the ocean taking all at once. Fair is a game they teach in school so everyone can lose the same. Keep your story straight, bright thing. This is hunger and laziness, and you built it into a decent trick. It carried you when you couldn\u2019t sleep. It smelled what you couldn\u2019t. It made itself,\u201d\u2014a pause, almost proud\u2014\u201cme. I am pretty.\u201d\n\nKip made his light very small. He made it a dot. He held it in his left hand, just above the heart line. He thought of the loop of seagrass again and did not take it out.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he asked finally. \u201cBeyond food.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be named,\u201d said the voice, and the smell softened, grew florals around edges he hadn\u2019t expected. \u201cTo be given a place. A purpose. I don\u2019t want to be the bin behind the chip shop, loved only by gulls. I want to be the hospital drain that took your spit and let you live. I want to be the worm at the heart of a plum but in a poem. I want to be your mouth when you say ugly and mean useful instead.\u201d\n\nHe had not been expecting that. He had been expecting it to ask for a little city of its own where it could make people faint in the daylight. He had been expecting it to ask him to leave, or to join, but not like this. He rubbed his thumb and forefinger together until his nails clicked. His chest hurt. He wanted to sleep. He wanted to walk to Tansy and put his head on her shoulder and tell her everything, and also to never have anyone say poor Kip with their eyes.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have my hands,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI have one thumbnail already,\u201d said the voice, amused. \u201cKeep the rest. I want a name that isn\u2019t a joke. I want not to be hungry. I want the luxury of a fast. Make me a job.\u201d\n\nKip started to laugh because the demand was so\u2026 domestic. A job. He had time, then, to craft what was needed. He shaped a thought as if he were making rope. \u201cNot drains. Not people. Compost, you said that word. Can you turn what would stink into what will feed? Can you make a garden out of waste? Can you be municipal in your horror?\u201d\n\nThe smell paused, considered. The tunnel breathed twice. Water dripped from somewhere like a metronome. In the space between one drop and another, a small shape bumped his ankle and he looked down and saw a rat, clean as rain, watching him as if she had brought her children here for a lecture and wanted to see if the pictures would be funny.\n\n\u201cI can,\u201d said the voice. \u201cI can be municipal.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Kip said. He lifted his hand. He did take the seagrass loop out then, and wound it twice round his wrist. \u201cRankin, I name you Rot-Right. I name you Curdle-Towards, Sour-With-Purpose. I name you Worm\u2019s-Hand and Bin-King and Lord of the Compost Heap, which is no insult in my bed. I name you Friend of Kitchens. I name you Hospital-Drain-Clean. I name you Runner of Rivulettes that feed trees. I name you Protector of Children\u2019s Stomachs, and that\u2019s the big one. You don\u2019t get to play the old joke at the shallow end anymore. Do you hear me?\u201d\n\nIt did. He knew it did because the smell changed again, where it curled around his tongue. It shifted from wanting everything to wanting one thing well. It smelled like a good garden on a hot day in January when tomatoes burst and someone laughs and says get a bowl, quick.\n\nBut he was not a fool. He did not think he had solved everything with a set of pretty names and a ridiculous title. He had set a pattern, that was all. Patterns help. Sometimes the tide is enough to keep them steady. Sometimes a storm comes. He would need help. He should have asked for it already. He would. He would.\n\n\u201cDo you belong to me,\u201d the voice said, sly now, trying the old trick of flipping the edge.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Kip said. \u201cWe belong to the same city. I will tell Aunt Beryl. I will tell the Anchor. We will set you to work. We will feed you, but not like that.\u201d\n\nIt shivered. He heard the start of a sulk and, underneath it, what might have been relief. Something inside him relaxed, as if an inn had put its shutters up in a good storm and lit the fire and put out blankets. He almost fell down right there and slept on the wet. He did not.\n\nHe turned around and began to walk back towards the light, slow enough to not be a prey animal. He went sideways through the letter-slot gap, stood under the bridge in the half-heart light, and felt the air again as if he had forgotten what it was. The night smelled like river and tea from a man\u2019s thermos and car exhaust and fried potato. He breathed all of it and smiled at all of it and was too tired to do anything with any of it.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d said a small voice near his ankle, the rat perhaps, or a child, or a piece of broken bottle that had a talent. \u201cYou forgot your shoe.\u201d\n\nHe looked down. He had not been wearing shoes.\n\nHe went to the caf\u00e9 where Tansy worked the evening shift. She made him hot chocolate with chili and a cinnamon stick, because she was an artist. Jet came in later with hair that had been washed too fast and jam on her sleeve. Aunt Beryl called three times and left three progressively more threatening messages about cake.\n\n\u201cYou look like you got in a fight with a mop,\u201d Tansy said softly when the caf\u00e9 was empty enough for honest talk. \u201cAnd lost.\u201d\n\n\u201cI talked to it,\u201d Kip said, setting his cup down so gently he wanted to laugh at himself. He had never been unsteady with a cup. He was unsteady now. \u201cI named it a job.\u201d\n\nTansy put her face in her hands and then took it out and looked as if she wished her hands had some other, larger use. \u201cYou what.\u201d\n\n\u201cI made a compost king,\u201d he said. He wanted to say, I made a thing of myself that hungers and hates. He wanted to say, I recognized my own tongue in the tunnel. He didn\u2019t. You can\u2019t say everything at once. The body will not let.\n\n\u201cIs that wise?\u201d Jet asked from behind a muffin. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m only eleven, but if somebody named me a job I didn\u2019t want I\u2019d chew their hat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked it,\u201d Kip said. \u201cIt wanted a place. I said yes to the part of it that might be useful. I said no to the part that eats kids. I will need help with the no. The Anchor warned me. I didn\u2019t listen fast enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone says no to kids,\u201d Tansy said, eyes far away. \u201cUntil they don\u2019t. Be careful.\u201d\n\nHe nodded and finished his chocolate and ate the cinnamon stick because it was better that way, and he liked how wrong it felt. He watched the door swing open and shut and tried not to think of the word he had avoided ever since the tunnel. It sits sideways on the tongue, the idea that the worst thing outside might be the shape of you. He was not there yet. He knew and did not know and hung the knowledge like washing on a line, where it could lift in wind and look like something else until you pulled it down and wore it.\n\nHe slept that night in a hollow under a bank of tea-tree near Rippleside. He dreams in odd loops and sometimes they catch him like a hook. Tonight his dreams went like this: a small boy holds a dead starfish and weeps and the smell of it makes him laugh; a girl dives and stays down and stays down and he pulls her up with long slow hands that are not his and he covers her mouth with rot and she lives; Aunt Beryl stirs a pot that is full of worms and sings under her breath, off-key; the Anchor takes the sea in her fist and squeezes it to jelly; Tansy sits at his left shoulder and says, \u201cYou.\u201d He woke three times, thirsty, and did not drink. The river gossiped all night.\n\nMorning did not make things simple. He thought it might. It looked as if it might. The light over the You Yangs was pale and deliberate. Early runners ran with their early runner faces; dogs did silly dog things and then looked serious about it. He let the water of the bay touch his ankles and pretended it was a consecration.\n\nHe went to Aunt Beryl with a basket of figs he had stolen off a fence and laid them on her table, which was a door on trestles. She looked at his face, not the figs, and said, \u201cOh, my love,\u201d the way an adult says oh when a child has found out that a magic trick was done with a mirror.\n\n\u201cYou made cake,\u201d he said. It seemed the right language.\n\nShe cut him a slice so big it made his wrists ache to hold the plate. \u201cYou made a friend,\u201d she said. \u201cOr you named your shadow. It\u2019s the same. Don\u2019t look at me. Eat. We\u2019ll unpick it. It\u2019s what we do. We\u2019ll unpick and pick again.\u201d\n\nHe did not mean to cry. He did mean to wash his hands before he touched anyone. Aunt Beryl took his hands and held them in her big soft bread-maker\u2019s hands and sniffed his thumb and said, \u201cAh. I wondered where my missing fat bowl went,\u201d and laughed, big and rude, and he laughed too and the laugh was the best kind, the one that comes with clean air. Afterwards she wrapped his thumb in a sprig of rosemary and told him to go to the Anchor and confess properly, and then to go down to the gardens by the university and see if the kind old bloke there in the broad-brim hat\u2014the one who actually listened to earth\u2014would want help composting. \u201cFeed your pet,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t starve it. That will only make it eat you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not a pet,\u201d he said, automatically, gently stubborn.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she agreed. \u201cIt isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a pocket in your jacket that you forgot was there. It will hold whatever you put into it until one day you put your hand in and a mouse jumps out and runs up your sleeve. Mind you don\u2019t throw the jacket into a fire with it on. That is to say: don\u2019t panic. The city makes more of this than you do.\u201d She kissed his head and shoved cake at him and he went back out into the bright day feeling stained and again.\n\nAt the garden, the old man with the broad-brim hat turned out to be a woman with severe glasses and a bright pink shirt that said For The Love Of Worms. She had badges on her hat: save our soils; kiss me I\u2019m carbon. He loved her immediately.\n\n\u201cI need a job for a smell,\u201d he said, which is not how normal people begin conversations, and she blinked and said, \u201cMe too, mate,\u201d and then laughed when he looked startled and explained about the new worm farm they were trying to keep from being raided by rats. He said he knew a rat who respected fences. She made him tea and told him to hold the bucket while she turned the pile and he held it and breathed and let what needed to feed feed.\n\nIt was early yet. There were weeks in it. Months. Years, perhaps. He was a patient person when he remembered to be. He was also a ferocious one when he forgot. The city went on. The bay breathed. Someone lit a fire in a backyard and leaned back smug and then panicked when the wind caught it, and somewhere further down the coast the skeletons of horses that had not outrun flame once upon a time reminded the grass how to be kind.\n\nIn the afternoon he went back to the drains with a string bag full of eggshells and coffee grounds and orange peels and left them like offerings in corners that wanted magic. He did it with the careful loving pettiness of grudge work. He did not say a word. He hummed. The smell came and went like a neighbor in a yard, arms folded on the fence.\n\nHe was not at the caf\u00e9 that evening. He was in a place he did not remember going to, a room with low ceilings and a carpet like teeth, and a man with a suit who said something about community engagement. Kip stared at his own reflection in a framed certificate and the glass swam until all he saw was the black shine of a drain, and then he saw his own mouth open and say, clear as day, \u201cWe are going to take what is rotting and fix it,\u201d and for an instant he did not know whether his voice had said it as him or as the thing inside that was him but other. The men in suits nodded as if he had made sense. Maybe he had. For once.\n\nHe went home with flyers about waste management and the knowledge that he had signed up for an open day in three weeks where he had promised to do a demonstration. He dreamt a wheelbarrow full of rinds. He woke laughing.\n\nThe smell came again, of course. It came size-shift, mood-shift, hunger-shift. It came with music from a party two streets over and it came with the sweat of a man who ran. He was getting used to it. He was getting not used to it. Both.\n\nHe heard a child say to her mother, that looks like a fairy, and the mother say don\u2019t be ridiculous and then apologize to the child when the sky changed color for no reason; he did not have anything to do with it. He did and he didn\u2019t.\n\nIt kept saying his name. Only sometimes. Only when it mattered. Always in that half-laugh. He was a clever boy. He was a mess. He was Geelong\u2019s oddest son, and he could feel the old city under the new city, the bones under the skin, the drains under the roads, the old docks under the new bars. He belonged to that. He always had. He had never been only one name. He carried the stink and the shine.\n\nHe would tell the Anchor the true version. He would. He would tell her he had made a shadow and made it a job and sat in the dark and spoke to himself in two voices and been afraid and loved how good he was at it. He would tell her he had never wanted to be ordinary. He would ask if she could show him how to tie his own beard over his nose when he was a hundred. He would ask to be told no, properly, often.\n\nHe walked the bay. He watched the wind build itself again out of nothing. He held his breath. He let it go. He grinned at a gull who was too smart for god and was in the middle of distracting a dog from a hot chip. He wanted to learn that trick. He wanted to be the dog. He wanted to be everything.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not done,\u201d the smell said, very polite, at his shoulder. \u201cWe are not done.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Kip said. \u201cGood. Help me wash.\u201d He stepped into the bath at Eastern Beach again and this time the water held him like an auntie and let him sink a little and then a little more until he could hear the voices of the tiles. He found the place where the child had swayed and got sick and he put his hands on it like a benediction and said to no one and to everyone and to himself, \u201cWe don\u2019t eat that. We step around that. There are rules.\u201d\n\nHe felt the agreement like rain. He felt disagreement like someone tearing a paper in another room. When he came up for air, Una tossed him a towel and said, \u201cWe\u2019re getting a sign made that says no vomit,\u201d and he said, \u201cMake it in Comic Sans if you want people to laugh,\u201d and she said, \u201cYou are very specific,\u201d and he said, \u201cIt\u2019s the job,\u201d and that was that.\n\nAt dusk, Aunt Beryl called again and said bring your thumbs to me and he did, and she trimmed his nails with scissors that had belonged to her mother and sang while she did it and then tucked the clippings into a jar and said, \u201cFor later,\u201d and when he looked as if he had a question, she added, \u201cNo, I won\u2019t tell you when. Don\u2019t go making it a day. Let it surprise you.\u201d\n\nHe walked home through a city that knew him by three names. He let it. He had room under his ribs for one more laugh. He had room for a smell and a song. He had room for the worst sort of kindness, the kind that fixes, that takes away what you thought was going to make you special and replaces it with a job. He had always wanted a job. He had wanted magic. He had both.\n\nHe slept and did not dream of drains.\n\nFor one night. Only one.Morning found him with sand in his hair and a taste like cold pennies behind his teeth. He stretched until his ribs clicked into one another in a satisfying way and lay still for one selfish minute, long enough to listen to the small things: water pushing its little shoulders against shore, wind rehearsing on a blade of grass, a beetle attempting a complicated maneuver on a twig and swearing in beetle. Then he got up and did the dull human business of wearing boots and pulling on a jacket as armor against attention, and went to find the woman who kept the bay stuck to its edges.\n\nThe Anchor met him two benches along from yesterday as if she had not moved in the dark, as if daylight merely lit the figure she always was. She had knitting today, a brutal-looking garment the color of stormwater with little knots in it like barnacles and needles that gleamed when they caught the sun. Humans looked at her and saw their grandmother or a threat, depending on how they had behaved with boats. Sprites saw a shipwright\u2019s patience, a ledger\u2019s sin-eater, and an iron ring where a headland might be. When Kip stopped, she did not make him speak at once; she looked at his hands, at the line of his mouth, at the bit of rosemary Aunt Beryl had tied on with string and not removed, and she made a thoughtful sound that could have meant anything from poor boy to well, of course.\n\n\u201cI have been an idiot,\u201d he said without preface, because sometimes penance is not a ceremony but a hand out with something that stings on it. He told her about the tunnel in a clean run, words like stones dropped into a bucket. He did not embroider and he did not try to make himself bigger where he had been small. He did not hide that part where he had laughed at rot and felt it as a kindness. He told her the names he had given it and the names it had given itself, and when he said Rot-Right her mouth twitched as if she had caught a fish by its lip and was not yet sure whether to keep it.\n\n\u201cYou set it to a wheel,\u201d she said, and the knitting needles went click, click like a bell buoy in a chop. \u201cYou gave it a spoke to follow and something to push against. That is not nothing. That is not always the wrong way. Tell me what you did to the child.\u201d\n\n\u201cI gave it rules,\u201d he said, and then he winced at his own pronoun and corrected it because the Anchor had a low tolerance for sloppy thinking. \u201cI gave them rules. I said, no children. It was not a bargain. I didn\u2019t let it be a bargain. It was a naming. I said it out loud to the bath and to the tiles and to Una\u2019s tattoo.\u201d\n\nThe Anchor nodded once, a slow weighty thing. \u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cEnough? No. A start? Yes. But. You did it alone. You went below alone, and you think very well of your own ability to keep a thread to your elbow, but threads snap on concrete with a little grit. I am going to say a word to you like a teacher with a ruler. Counterweight. You are all air and sideways with a weight in your pocket you think is a stone. It is not. It is a jelly. We will put a stone on the other side.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like stones,\u201d he said mildly, because even now he wanted to make it less sharp. \u201cWhat kind?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo kinds,\u201d she said, and put the knitting down and looked at him without any humor for a compact span of time. \u201cOne you wear. One you ask for. You will wear a ring of iron. Not a pretty thing. Not a story thing. A piece of rail cut with a hacksaw and bent cold. It will make your wrist itch and make people look at you and not see what you want them to see. It will slow the bit of you that runs ahead and opens doors. You will not take it off except to wash your skin under it every third day. If you take it off without telling me why, I will find you and make sure you remember that sometimes keels are people. The other weight is company. You do not go under alone again. You take Tansy or Beryl or the screw-listening boy or Alan who never spells his name the same twice or that glass shimmer of a child, Jet. You take them not to be brave but to be seen. Your kind disappears too easily when it suits you, and I am very, very old and very tired of pulling you back out by your ankle.\u201d\n\nKip let himself feel the chastening without hiding from it. It made his skin burn in a useful way. He had always thought he preferred to be told no by someone who loved him and could hit hard without missing. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, because there weren\u2019t other words of value. \u201cI\u2019ll wear your ugly ring. I\u2019ll bring a friend. Two friends if I can bribe them with cake.\u201d\n\n\u201cCake is currency,\u201d the Anchor agreed gravely, and then she smiled, a sudden flash of harbor-light. \u201cI say ugly because I am jealous. I never had a pretty ring. The bay does that to your taste. Go down to the rails at North Wharf and ask Old Trevor to cut you a bit. He\u2019ll make a joke about prison. Let him. He was never in a prison that wasn\u2019t a marriage. Also\u2014\u201d she paused to count stitches, and the interval broke the air neatly into before advice and after advice\u2014 \u201cdon\u2019t name anything municipal without checking whether City has already named it. They will sue you. They will come with clipboards and ask if you have permission to call a thing that. If you put a hat on a rat and call it Chair, they will take minutes.\u201d\n\nHe snorted and felt the weight in his chest lighten imperceptibly. \u201cI have a meeting in three weeks,\u201d he confessed, remembering the carpet like teeth and the phrase community engagement spoken as if it might be a talisman. \u201cI promised to make a presentation. About compost. For worms.\u201d\n\nHer look softened. \u201cOh, my heart,\u201d she said in gentle mockery. \u201cYou stumble into civilian life like a swan into a hardware store. It will be fine. Bring samples. Make old men hold handfuls of good dirt. Bring pictures of children who have green things for lunch because you don\u2019t feed the drains. Make a joke and make it again. People believe what they laugh at twice.\u201d\n\nHe nodded and then, because he had held the darkest part back until he had done the tidy parts, he said, \u201cAnd it said my name like I say my name. It laughed my laugh in a place where you shouldn\u2019t hear that sort of thing. It wants a job and it wants a home. I am both and I am not. I wanted to be kind and clever and instead I feel like I have adopted a nephew I once killed by accident and then brought back as a houseplant.\u201d\n\nThe Anchor didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cYou are not unique,\u201d she said. \u201cDo not be insulted. Everyone reptiles their shadow at least once if they live long. You have done it in time. The worst are the ones who wait and wait and then discover that the shadow is a city block wide and already married with children. Don\u2019t be frightened of being ordinary in this. You are very good at dressing work in outrageous clothes so that you feel special doing it. That will serve you now. Outrageous clothes are a protection for shy jobs. Dress your Rot as a king of bins until he believes he is a uniform. And when fear comes up at you and wants to be eaten, send it to me. I like my breakfast complicated.\u201d\n\nIt was ridiculous to be steady after that. It was also exactly what he was. He let himself be ordinary in the best way, which was to sit with his elders and not argue with their sense. He sat long enough to feel his muscles become the bench\u2019s muscles, long enough for the bay to shift color twice, and when he got up to go she stuck a pin in his jacket like an aunt at a christening. It was a thin strip of steel twisted into the shape of nothing in particular. Humans would say modernist. Sprites felt the relief of a promise when they looked at it, a dinghy tied with a knot that had seen weather. \u201cFor your cuff when you get silly,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is, always.\u201d\n\nHe went north for the iron. North Wharf was a place that hid under its own stories; the tang of rust had become a perfume there, and the old men who stood with their hands in their pockets watching the gulls had faces like the front pages of newspapers left to bleach on dashboards. Old Trevor had eyebrows like nesting materials and salt tattoos that no sailor would ever have admitted to liking. He did not ask why Kip wanted iron; he did not ask anything except whether Kip had brought him something he could tell his wife about to explain the favor. Kip, prepared by a lifetime in this city for that exact question, put a tin of Aunt Beryl\u2019s apricot jam in his hand and said, \u201cTell her it\u2019s for toast and thanks,\u201d and Trevor cut the rail with a carefulness that would have shamed a surgeon and then hammered it against his own knee until it made a brutal circle.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get a rash under that,\u201d Trevor said, cheerful as a storm. \u201cDon\u2019t scratch. Bandage. Rub it with spit. Wash it in vinegar. Keep both your hands. I like your hands. They look like they should be breaking things that need to be broken.\u201d\n\nKip slid the iron over his wrist and his breath hitched in a way he hadn\u2019t expected, a small skip as if music had changed key. It was ugly. It was perfect. For a wild useless moment he wanted someone to see it and kiss it like it meant they understood something about him. He settled for the itch and the ache that told him he was less likely to step sideways out of his own body like a bored ghost. He thanked Trevor three times in different registers and left before he said something sentimental and got beaten with a newspaper for his trouble.\n\nThe day had grown fat around the edges by the time he got to the university gardens with his string bag of kitchen leavings. For The Love Of Worms was there again in her bright pink, her hat now adorned with a laminated map of the composting system and a badge that said ask me about leachate in a font too happy for the word. She took his bag with reverence; she had the worshipper\u2019s eye when it came to banana peels. \u201cWe had a possum try to convert last night,\u201d she said, meaning a raid, meaning pest management, and pointed with her chin at a little patch of fence that had been chewed into because a possum had thought the answer to hunger was inside. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand about patience.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of us don\u2019t,\u201d Kip said, and then he saw the rat. She sat on top of the newest heap with her hands folded on her little belly, looking like a grandmother over soup. Beside her was a teenager rat with a torn ear and the restless look of someone who wanted to graffiti his own name on a moving tram. When Kip sketched a greeting in the careful loose language of gutter, the mother rat flattened her ears and skittered two steps closer as if to be polite and also in case there was bread.\n\n\u201cNobody told me there would be sauces,\u201d she said, because she smelled the orange peels and coffee grounds and eggshells like spices, and Kip bowed with deeper respect than he had used in the carpeted room. \u201cMrs Ipswich,\u201d she added to save him embarrassment of guessing. \u201cMy boy calls himself Knife because of course he does. He does not bite unless asked. Which he is frequently and unreasonably asked. We watch your piles now. It keeps us moral. I told the girls on the bridge to leave your worm beds alone because once I got fat on a pie near the train station and it made me stupid. Carbs are a trap.\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs Ipswich, I need a set of eyes with whiskers,\u201d Kip said, thinking of corners under roads and places where drains breathed slowly like asthmatics. \u201cI need to know if the smell I am training goes where I tell it and not where it shouldn\u2019t. Will you be my municipal inspector? I can pay in the ends of things and in ensuring that the traps the council sets are sprung closed before the men with boots remember them.\u201d\n\nMrs Ipswich blinked in that rat way that is skeptical and pleased. \u201cIt is always men with boots,\u201d she said, because female rats had made a study of the category and found it wanting. \u201cYes, bright boy. We will watch. But in return we want a corridor. A safe one. A pipe from here to the river where no one batters us with a shovel. We want our children to learn to swim without being taught by garbage.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can do that,\u201d For The Love Of Worms put in, because she had a heart large enough to include rodents if it meant the compost went undisturbed. \u201cLook, if we re-purpose the old greywater outflow, and we talk to Facilities about putting a grate with a hinge on it, the kids can go in and out like they\u2019re residents. We can write a sign: RATS ONLY. Then if anyone objects I can tell them it\u2019s part of a research project.\u201d\n\nKip could have kissed them both. He restrained himself and put his silly specificity where it counted, in a small plan that was a big shape. He walked the perimeter, he hummed luck like a joke with its hand over its mouth, he named the path Mrs Ipswich and Knife would use with a little sideways magic that made it look to human eyes like an inconvenience and to rat eyes like a lane in Paris. He left crumbs of his own thinking along it like the pips of a fruit he wasn\u2019t sure about yet. He set the first proper task for Rot-Right without going underground: he stood beside the newest heap, warm as breath, and said as even as he knew how, \u201cTake this heat and make it into soil that says thank you when we step on it. Keep it here. Keep ahead of the flies. No games with tongues that aren\u2019t yours.\u201d\n\nThe answer came not as a word but as a change in texture, a little settling as if a hand had smoothed a bedspread and promised to come back with tea. The smell was not sweet, and it was not cruel. It was a working smell, a job. Kip breathed it and felt the ring on his wrist throb once in time with his pulse, and for the first time since the tunnel he did not immediately think about his thumb. He thought about worms with the contentment of a parish priest thinking about his congregation and their silly, earnest sins.\n\nFrom the gardens he went to find Tansy, not because he could not go under alone\u2014he could now, easily, the iron made it simple to behave\u2014but because he had been told not to and he was a boy who had discovered that sometimes rules are not an affront but a kindness offered across a table. He found her on her smoke break, which was to say she stood near the rubbish bins with her hoodie up and her arms folded and the fake cigarette behind her ear because she had decided to give up again for the fifth time this year. She had a face that would have made a saint shape her behavior; she used it to make teenagers pick up their litter and to convince grown men that there was not a single chip left.\n\nHe did not say, I want you because I am frightened of who I am in the dark. He said, \u201cWant to come under the bridge with me and talk to something rude?\u201d and she tipped her head back and groaned because he knew what gifts to bring.\n\n\u201cLet me get my boots,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we should bring Jet because she will cry if she hears she was left out, and also because she will complain loudly enough to attract help if we do something truly idiotic. Also Alan. Alan is a good counterweight. He\u2019s all right angles and bolts. I like the way he refuses to use the right wrench out of principle.\u201d\n\nThey collected their company like cheese and crackers. Jet turned up with a windcheater that said Swim Team even though she did not swim; she liked uniforms on other people. Alan\u2014or Allen or Allan depending on which hardware store had given him a loyalty card that week\u2014met them with a bag of screws he had been listening to all morning. He looked like a walking toolbox, and he had a worrying habit of falling in love with machines. Kip loved him for the way he steadied the air when he stood in it. He took them to the Prince\u2019s Bridge and then, because he had promised, he did the unglamorous thing of standing still and making sure everyone had a way back out before they went in.\n\nUnder the bridge it was damp and complicated. The day\u2019s heat had curled into itself and made a smell like old library and tar. Kip felt the first brush of Rot-Right along his jaw in a greeting that was insolent and domestic at once, and he raised an eyebrow at the air as if disapproving of a cousin with bad jokes. \u201cWe brought witnesses,\u201d he said aloud because it mattered. \u201cWe brought friends. We brought someone who will hit me if I go sideways.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d Tansy said. \u201cI have been practicing open-hand slaps on wallabies who steal sandwiches.\u201d\n\nJet peered at the darkness and then at Kip, her eyes going minnows again. \u201cIt won\u2019t stick to me, will it? I have my school carnival next week and if I vomit on the starting block again I have to go to church.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t stick,\u201d Kip said, easy as a lie that happened to be true today, and he felt Rot-Right\u2019s attention flick to Jet and then away, sensing the wrong meal. He moved his fingers through the air in a pattern Aunt Beryl called a grandmother\u2019s weave when she taught him to keep busy hands busy and tied their threads to his own elbow and to the iron and to Tansy\u2019s scowling mouth. \u201cHello,\u201d he said, as if this were a neighbor\u2019s kitchen and he had brought scones. \u201cWe have rules. We have a job. Do you want to meet my friends and not scare them?\u201d\n\nIt came like fog does, all at once and also not at all. The smell rose and spread and then settled lower, a polite guest conscious of their own heavy perfume. Alan made a face that suggested he had licked a battery. Tansy breathed through her mouth and glared, which made the smell pull itself in a fraction like a dog told to leave it. Jet stood on one foot and then the other and muttered, \u201cIt\u2019s not as big as Birdie said. She said it was like the smell of a fish two buses ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt changes,\u201d Kip said, and put his hand on the tunnel wall so he could feel the water, its lazy rush. \u201cRot-Right. This is Tansy. Do not tease her. She will break your nose and you will discover you had one. This is Jet. She is new and thus very precious. You will not bite her. This is Alan. He keeps the metal in this city from sulking. He will tell you to mind your own business with drains. You will obey him because he has a wrench and no tolerance for nonsense.\u201d\n\nThere was a sensation like a nod, a lowering of temperature that wasn\u2019t cold but that made the hair stand up on their arms. Alan squared up to the air as if he were at a tradesman convention and said with all the dignity of a man in love with bolts, \u201cThat grate on the west side needs a new bracket. Don\u2019t lean on it. I\u2019ll bring a proper one tomorrow. If you eat the bracket, I will come down here with a magnet and retrieve every small piece of you that adheres and use you to attract screws at a market stall.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like him,\u201d Rot-Right said inside Kip\u2019s voice, borrowing his mouth just enough to make the others twitch. Kip surrendered an inch and then took it back. He had promised not to make bargains without asking. He made a show of spitting on his thumb and wiping the wall to break the shape. Tansy did not hit him, but she did flick his ear hard, which was mathematics of a sort.\n\nThey walked a slow loop through the section of drain that had been worst the day before. The heavy sense of hunger had thinned in the corners, replaced by a slick little satisfaction, and every time he felt it Kip named it again in his head, softly, like laying out teaspoons: Worm\u2019s-Hand, Bin-King, Sour-With-Purpose. At one bend, where the silt made a shape like an ear listening, they came upon something new: a stain on the stain, a smear of black that did not belong to any story he knew. It smelled not of rot but of solvent, the hateful clean of something that eats paint. Alan went on one knee like a man proposing to a chemical and examined without touching. Tansy swore under her breath in the delicate river language of frogs. Jet said, \u201cUgh,\u201d like a child at a butcher\u2019s window.\n\n\u201cNot ours,\u201d Alan said in the tone that meant he will call in favors for this. \u201cIndustrial. Somebody poured something down the wrong throat. They do that when they think nobody watches.\u201d\n\n\u201cCHOICES?\u201d Jet asked, because the acronym had turned into a game at school, into whispers and dares. \u201cDo we call and ask them to forget it for us?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tansy said with a firmness that made the dark look safer. \u201cCHOICES will forget the wrong bit and leave us with the man who thinks that the best way to clean a stovetop is bleach and fire. We call Aunt Beryl because she knows people with hoses. We tell the Anchor because she knows how to frighten a foreman without moving from her chair. We tell For The Love Of Worms because she will chain herself to a pipe and get on the news.\u201d\n\nKip felt Rot-Right push away from the black smear, offended, which was a relief and an alarm. He could use offense. He could turn insult into appetite for the right thing. He could also watch it make a new hunger, and there were only so many rules you could tie onto a living idea before it gnawed through boredom. He took a breath and then another, setting his ribs like a net against a hard, slippery pull. \u201cLeave that,\u201d he said aloud for clarity. \u201cNot yours. Not mine. We will get brooms. We will get buckets. We will do this like stupid humans in yellow vests and hats. You can watch and be self-righteous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a mood,\u201d Tansy murmured, amused despite the sting in her nose. \u201cI like this version of you. It suits the iron.\u201d\n\nThey marked the place with chalk and an argument with the stone, which would hold until morning. On the way out, Jet snagged her toes on something bright and picked up a small plastic bracelet that said LiveStrong in the remnant language of a charity that had meant well and then gone sideways. She turned it in her fingers as if expecting it to speak. Kip took it and made a face and then slid it onto the iron as a joke that would either make the universe chuckle or take it personally. It made his wrist look like a child had decorated a prisoner. He liked the dissonance. He made it a promise to remember that good intentions are not armor. He made it an oath with plastic for a seal.\n\nThey emerged into late afternoon and the kind of light that makes even ugly buildings look like they have meant to be that way. The smell of hot chips and sunscreen rushed them like lovers who had been waiting for months. On the promenade, Aunt Beryl was pretending to mind her own business and failing; she had a sense for when her people went under rocks. She had a hose in one hand and a bucket in the other and two teenage boys behind her already wearing high-visibility vests that clashed offendly with their aesthetic. \u201cWe are going to be stupid humans now,\u201d she said briskly. \u201cI told the council it was a community art project. They said okay because they thought it would keep us busy. If anyone asks, we are painting things that only show up when it rains.\u201d\n\nTansy kissed her on the cheek and took a vest; Jet pretended to hate hers and then straightened it so that it sat right on her narrow shoulders. Alan hefted a broom like a weapon he had been born to wield, and Mrs Ipswich appeared on the lip of a gutter with four of her girls and six boys, all eyes and whisker, and announced that they would appreciate a break in the gendered labor division and take that far corner. Kip took a breath and then another and felt his bones count themselves.\n\nThey worked until their backs spoke fluent complaint. They scrubbed and swept and made jokes of the kind that make work light even when work is mud and chemicals and fear dressed up as seriousness. Aunt Beryl sang a baking song and made it rude; Jet invented harmonies that were wrong on purpose; Alan lectured the drain about respect with the tone of a man who will teach his toaster to regard toast as a vocation. The black smear lightened and then broke, and when the first strip came away there was a smell like rubber promises and Kip had to hold his breath and say his own name twice to not make a door with his mouth and pull the wrong thing in to eat it all in one gulp.\n\n\u201cHat,\u201d the Anchor said later, when they took their wet vests to the caf\u00e9 and hung them outside as if they were flags of an improbable nation. She had turned up without anyone seeing her arrive, as she did. \u201cIf you are going to do this thing where you make municipal work look like a sacrament, wear a hat. The sun will steal your sense otherwise, and then I have to hold your ears on when they fall off.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a hat for worm day,\u201d Kip said, hearing himself sound sixteen and feeling no shame in it. \u201cIt has a badge.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course it has a badge,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything you wear has an opinion.\u201d She plucked at the plastic bracelet on his iron and made a face. \u201cThis is tasteless and perfect. I approved of that charity until it turned out the man was a man. Keep it. Let it annoy me.\u201d\n\nThey fed themselves like children after sport: chips, battered fish, a noble salad Tansy insisted on that tasted better than it had a right to. The city moved around them in the kindly way some places have when they are pleased with what their people are up to. Kip felt Rot-Right sit at his shoulder like a dog allowed inside for once, head on paws, watching with bright greedy little eyes and refraining from begging because it had been taught that it could not put its nose on the table. He wanted to stroke the air and say good job and that felt like a perversion; he resisted and ate his chips and told Jet to stop putting vinegar on everything because she was making the paper melt.\n\nNight brought new rumors like candy in pockets. Someone sent a message that the underpass near the old tallow works had started to sing. Someone else said a man had taken off his shoes by the botanic gardens lake and walked in and then walked out again and claimed he had seen a horse, which meant old fire had rolled over something and made it a picture. A woman came to the caf\u00e9 with a child who had the leftover emptiness of a morning\u2019s sickness behind her eyes, and Una came by and sat for a minute and told Tansy that the bath had a stubborn taste at the shallow end like someone had boiled a kettle in it and then put their hand in and shouted. Kip listened and did the arithmetic that this city makes you do when you love it: how much? how bad? who do we call? what in exchange?\n\nHe could have stopped there, made the day his flag, slept the sleep of a person with a ring on their wrist and rules on their tongue. He could, but other appetites in other people don\u2019t obey even the best intentions. Around midnight, too late for a decent soul and too early for a sinner, his phone\u2014a thing he owned both ironically and because a rat queen had insisted\u2014buzzed with a message that had not come down any network he paid for. It was in the shape of scent, which is to say it didn\u2019t show on the screen and it made him swallow before he answered. It said: child, hurry. It said: old fat old fat old fat, which was Rot-Right\u2019s shorthand for trouble in a place where once animals had fed a city and now only ghosts did. He didn\u2019t wake Tansy or call Jet or drag Alan out of bed like a lover with bad timing. He got as far as thinking of their faces and then stopped with his hand on the door because the iron on his wrist had heated to a slow warn. He had promised. He had said he would not go alone. He stood there and let that irritation that always lived at the back of him rise until he could taste its lemon, and then he sent three messages that looked like prayers and were just logistics.\n\nThe tallow works had been a stink and a half in their day, a religion of fat. People had once dipped their hands into tallow and rubbed it into leather and hair, had boiled it and made candles, had carted it off in barrels that leaked and made dogs love whatever road it had touched. Now it was brick and memory and signage with sepia photographs of stern men who had never learned to smile without a pipe. The drains underneath had eaten a thousand small deaths and could not be expected to pretend they hadn\u2019t. When Kip and his tired small army went down with torches and buckets and the foolishness that makes citizens out of us, he felt the place rise like a bear out of sleep and had to make himself larger inside to not be taken for an intruder. Tansy had brought a bag of coffee grounds and sacrilege\u2014someone\u2019s leftover gravy in a jar\u2014and Jet had a superstition in her pocket in the shape of a coin that had been run over by a train and come out more patient. Alan had a bolt from a ship that had never found its home and wanted one; he carried it like a dog carries a toy.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the same as before. That mattered. The black solvent-smear glowed in their torchlight in a way that felt wrong, and the smell that rose was not Rot-Right\u2019s humble pantry. It made Kip think of a hospital corridor lit too bright with bleach, and for a moment he swayed and had to find the rail with his hand and hear the iron on his wrist sing. He didn\u2019t so much see as understand that someone had not poured waste in fear or laziness this time. Someone had practiced. The smear sat in the corner like a prank, like a man with a hat pulled low waiting to watch people slip.\n\n\u201cNot accident,\u201d Alan said softly, and if he had not had both hands on his broom he would have found a way to hit something that could be blamed. \u201cNot stupid. This is done with an idea. And it\u2019s the wrong idea.\u201d\n\nJet edged behind Tansy as if she were smaller and needed the height. \u201cWho would do that?\u201d she asked, genuinely bewildered. \u201cWho would pour poison on purpose where children go to get rid of their fears?\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople who want to sell something,\u201d Tansy said. \u201cPeople who make you frightened and then hand you a bottle with a label that says salvation and a price tag that makes your teeth hurt. Or bored men who want to see if they can get in a paper. Or, gods help me, someone like Kip who thinks he can keep a lid on a thing and then forgets that lids are for pots, not ponds.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Kip said, and then, to his own surprise, laughed because she had offered him a mean little gift: the chance to reject guilt that wasn\u2019t his, and he cherished those. \u201cThis one doesn\u2019t smell like me. It smells like\u2014\u201d He stopped because he had to chew the idea before it could be words. \u201cIt smells like removal. Not decay. It wants things to go away without consequence. It is the opposite of us.\u201d\n\nRot-Right bristled inside him like a cat when a dog is mentioned. He felt it push itself between him and the smear, not to eat it but to stand there as if insulted by the chemistry. It made a new smell he had not smelled on it before, a bitter pride, and he realized with a start of something like hope that giving anything a job makes it jealous of that job\u2019s dignity. It wanted to be the only sovereign of certain filths. He could use that. He could ride it like a bad pony if he was careful.\n\n\u201cEat around it,\u201d he said, soft, and Rot-Right rolled its shoulders like a boxer and did what it was told, taking the edges of filth and turning them, taste by taste, into something a worm would smile for. The center stain sulked and did not change. Alan crossed himself in a way that was not church but habit, and Tansy folded her arms so that nobody could see that the tiny hairs on them had lifted.\n\nThey set to with buckets and old cloths. They worked like fools. Aunt Beryl arrived with a bottle of vinegar and the stinging voice of someone who once ran a kitchen where men had bled on chopping boards and bragged about it. The Anchor did not come, but the feeling of her did, the sense of a keel under them, and Kip found himself talking to the dark about why drains matter as if he were a teacher and not a boy with too many talents he had not learned to hide. He talked and worked and held his wrist steady when the iron made him want to scratch until he bled. He did not let Rot-Right play with the fear that started slow in Jet\u2019s ribs and built when they found a small dead fish where it should not have been. He paid attention to brick and flow and bolts. He made himself a man doing a job instead of a story trying to write itself.\n\nWhen they were done, it wasn\u2019t done-done. It was better. It was a promise that someone saw. It was a warning. On the way back to the light, they met a man in a hi-vis vest with a council logo and clipboards for hands. He had the look of someone who had read a policy and married it, and his smile was the kind that had to be practiced. \u201cEvening,\u201d he said. \u201cCommunity engagement?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Kip said in a voice that could have been a lie and wasn\u2019t. \u201cWe are engaging the community with ourselves as they are too busy to come along. We are going to put up a sign that says we do not pour death here.\u201d\n\nThe man looked at their buckets and their black streaked cuffs and Aunt Beryl\u2019s vinegar and Allen\u2019s broom and Jet\u2019s coin and Tansy\u2019s don\u2019t-test-me and he adjusted his expectations on the spot like a belt. \u201cWe had a call,\u201d he said, and flicked through papers as if the answer would be printed for him so he wouldn\u2019t have to summon it. \u201cFrom CHOICES. They said there were reports of a\u2026 smell. But that it had been dealt with.\u201d\n\n\u201cCHOICES would tell you we died to save you and then ask for a signature,\u201d Aunt Beryl said with sweet venom. \u201cHelp us with the sign. Or get out of the way.\u201d\n\nHe got out of the way. After he had, he stood with his clipboard and watched them finish by the light of phones and stubborn, and there was a tiny shift in his spine that said something had moved in him where rules live. He would go home and tell someone who wore a tie that he had seen a thing that worked, and he would take credit, and maybe next time he would bring gloves and not tell his boss.\n\nThat night Kip slept without the sea talking in his ear. He slept without drains. He dreamt, briefly, of a worm in a top hat conducted by a rat with a baton. He woke laughing in that helpless way that makes your ribs ache and then found his iron ring pressed a round mark into his skin and itched like truth. He did not take it off. He did not scratch. He rubbed vinegar into it as instructed and thought of Trevor\u2019s grave cheer. Then he went out into a day that had not been made new by his labor and was nevertheless a little brighter in the corners where he had scrubbed.\n\nHe forgot, for a precious hour between breakfast and the hour when the sun reminds everyone that their bodies are animals, that he was interesting. He sat in the library and read a pamphlet about municipal waste with serious attention and translated its bureaucrat into person speech in his head. He made notes with a pencil Aunt Beryl had sharpened with a knife. He thought about what he would say at worm day that would make old men put their fingers into a bucket and come up smiling. He wrote ROT RIGHT in big letters and then crossed it out and wrote ROT-RIGHT with a hyphen and then circled it and then put a line through that too because the Anchor would smack his head for trying to brand an idea that wasn\u2019t finished. He frowned at the word leachate so hard that a woman across from him laughed behind her laptop and he looked up and smiled with his mouth like a shy dog.\n\nThe city did not leave him that hour as a gift without price. At eleven, his phone sang out with a ringtone he had not set and would not have chosen\u2014bagpipes; the universe is a comedian with poor taste. It was not Aunt Beryl or Tansy or Alan or Mrs Ipswich with gossip. It was a number he didn\u2019t know and a voice he recognized from two meetings ago, a suit voice with friendliness sprayed on. \u201cKip,\u201d it said, and he could see the man\u2019s shiny shoes and his fear of having his tie pulled by a toddler. \u201cWe are so excited about your demonstration. We\u2019ve had a wonderful idea. There\u2019s a developer coming to have a look at the waterfront and we think it would be marvelous if you could do your little show just when he walks past. It will show community spirit. It will show that we are, ah, responsible. It will show that the smell\u2014what smell?\u2014isn\u2019t an issue. You understand.\u201d\n\nThe ring on his wrist ate three heartbeats and spat them back out hot. Kip breathed once and then left the library because he did not want to say no under that polite quiet. He walked out into lemon and steel and the taste of expanding day and let himself be his most harmless voice while he sharpened it underneath. \u201cI understand that you want to hire me for free to make a man feel less afraid of something he should be very afraid of if he wants to put his name on it,\u201d he said, kindly. \u201cI understand that you will put my name on a flyer in small letters and then throw it away. I understand that if I say yes this time you will ask and ask until I say no rudely and then you will say community engagement is so hard. I will do my demonstration for the people who bring banana peels in their pockets. If your man is one of those, he is welcome. If not, he can watch me love dirt and be confused.\u201d\n\nThere was a little silence. It had paperwork around it. Then the voice said, pleasant in a way that would look like teeth if you could see it, \u201cI don\u2019t think you appreciate\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are correct,\u201d Kip said and hung up because Aunt Beryl had once taught him there is a kind of magic in ending a conversation before the other person has written your line for you. He put his phone in his pocket and let his ears ring in a way that wasn\u2019t a hex but would do. Then he went to the garden and checked on the piles. Then he went to the bath and put his hands in and did nothing except let the tiles tell him who had put their feet there and been afraid and learned not to be. Then he went to the Anchor and sat with her while she knitted enough for someone with hips. They did not talk about anything that needed a name.\n\nTowards evening, he found a child on the promenade staring into the gaps between planks with the seriousness of someone who has lost something important. She had a plait that was too tight and shoes that had been carefully chosen because they flashed when she stepped in a certain way. Her mother was on a bench doing the long deep breathing of a person who is on the edge of the day and of tears and does not have the luxury of either. Kip crouched with his knees making agreeable noises and said, \u201cWhat is missing?\u201d and the child said, \u201cMy fish is in the water,\u201d with the dignity of a person who is already rehearsing loss. He put his face close to the gap and saw a plastic fish with a stupid grin and something else in the water, something that had no grin. He put his fingers down and almost put them into a smell. He did not. He used his light and he used a small shape he had kept since he was too small to do anything but play\u2014hook-and-pull\u2014and he lifted the toy. The child did not smile. She looked at him as if she had expected it to be simple and everything else to be harder. He put the fish in her hand and said, because it was the only vow that mattered, \u201cWe don\u2019t eat what you love,\u201d and the water under him agreed so sweetly he could have wept.\n\nHe would break his rules soon. He was that kind of creature. He would go down alone because someone\u2019s breath would be running out and because he trusted himself too much and because Rot-Right would laugh like he did and promise. He would do it; he knew it like knowing your own calf muscle in the night. But not today. Today he had an iron ring and a rat queen and a woman in pink who loved worms like they were saints. He had an Anchor who had told him he was ordinary and made it sound like a blessing. He had Aunt Beryl\u2019s cake in a tin on top of a fridge with a note on it that said touch and die and a smaller note under it that said unless you are hungry. He had a smell that now wore a badge that said municipal and a set of knees that made him remember to stand carefully on wet steps.\n\nWhen he went to sleep, he put the ring on a string and ran the string up to the hook Aunt Beryl had once used to hang herbs to dry. He slept with his hand tangled in it so that if he stirred, it would pull and he would remember there was gravity and that he had agreed. In his dream, a gull stole a hot chip and then brought it back because it had forgotten how to chew and Rot-Right, in a little cap like a stationmaster, showed it how, patiently, cheap and expert at once. In the morning he woke to fingernails against a window and for a long raspberry of a second he was back in the tunnel. He sat up fast enough to pull the string and make the iron knock his wrist and wince and swear, and then he saw the culprit: a boy with a face mostly made of good intentions holding a flyer against the glass. It said WORM DAY in letters that had been written by an optimist and then traced by a pessimist, and under it Aunt Beryl had written in texta bring your stink. He did not know he was laughing until his ribs protested. He dressed. He made a list that included words like signage and buckets and children and Mrs Ipswich and Alan\u2019s bracket. He went to work. He let himself be ridiculous about it. He hummed a song about leachate and decided he did not care if it had too many syllables. He was, for the moment and with an ugly ring telling him a story every time it itched, an honest boy with a job.The morning opened itself like a door that had been painted too often and stuck, then gave way with a sigh and a flake of old color, and everything behind it smelled of cardboard and grass. Kip arrived at the university gardens carrying two buckets of coffee grounds and a bag that clinked with jars because Aunt Beryl believed in samples, publicity, and sugar in equal portions. His hat had a badge on it that declared him an enthusiast of microfauna and the pin the Anchor had stuck in his cuff did not behave like jewelry; it behaved like a nail through a plank and made his sleeve sit different. The iron ring sat on his wrist under the bright yellow of a reused festival wristband that said in wobbly text WORM DAY while the old LiveStrong bracelet took the whole combination very seriously and made grown men smirk and then look away because irony felt risky around someone with a job.\n\nFor The Love Of Worms had turned the lawn into a fair that wouldn\u2019t scare a crow, which took skill. There were trestles with laminated signboards articulating the romance of leachate, a kid\u2019s corner with cardboard tubes that allowed small people to emulate an earthworm without suffocation, and three plastic tubs of finished compost with wooden spoons for people to turn and smell so they would remember that the word humus wasn\u2019t a dip but a hymn. Her real name turned out to be Maureen if you caught her hat off, which no one did unless she wanted them to, and she had recruited two science students with hands like puppies to man the stall that sold tiny worm farms in clear boxes so people could pretend to be gods and then discover they didn\u2019t like having that much responsibility. Mrs Ipswich and Knife perched on the edge of a straw bale like judges on a cooking show, washing their whiskers with an air of moral superiority that would have been unbearable in any creature without a tail, and their cousins patrolled the freshly hinged grate that led to the safe corridor like they had been municipal staff all their lives.\n\nAlan had parked himself at the point most likely to be mistaken for structural vulnerability and hung his new bracket from his belt as a talisman while he explained to a boy in a scooter helmet that screws have desires and you can either listen or strip them and live with your shame. Tansy ran the book for swaps, which meant a handwritten list of who had brought banana peels and who had delivered eggshells and who was now owed a baggie of soil in return, and she made sly marks in the corner for those who left their contributions in plastic. Jet wore a high-vis vest that drowned her and had a whistle that she was not allowed to use and therefore could not stop touching. Aunt Beryl stood behind a table that had a sign in texta that read CAKE and had iced three slab cakes with the same word in three different languages because she liked showing off and because if someone complained, she could pretend it was accidental.\n\nThe council had lent them bunting in the shape of leaves that made the worm farm look like it was celebrating an election, and someone had convinced a band of local teenagers to play a set of songs about soil that were nearly comprehensible and very sincere. A man from Facilities trudged up with a cone witch\u2019s hat that said wet floor and then, realizing that if he put it on the lawn it would symbolize damp grass, he endured a crisis of ontology that he solved by giving it to Jet and asking her not to wear it, which she immediately did. The day was not hot enough to be cruel and not cold enough to test anyone\u2019s vows; it was a good day with a small shiver running through it like a cat under a table thinking about knocking over a vase.\n\nKip felt Rot-Right in his ribs and his knees and the skin inside his wrists, present the way warmth is present in bread not long out of an oven, and he had to keep an eye on it the way you keep an eye on children who have just discovered carrying chairs over their heads. He was very good at being ordinary when there was an audience for it, which is to say he had practiced being a version of himself that let other people talk and then talked back in ways that did not scare them. His job today was to take the idea of rot, which most people thought of as failure, and dress it like a success in a suit made of tomatoes and a tie made of the laughter that happens when a person who thinks they hate gardening puts their nose into soil and comes away stunned. He threaded his iron ring around the handle of a shovel for a moment to ground himself, felt it bite, and put it back where it belonged with care that would have looked superstitious if anyone had been watching closely.\n\nThe suits arrived later than they said and overprepared, carrying branded water bottles and expressions that had been practiced in mirrors until the wrinkles at the edges of their eyes knew when to do their dance. They came with a developer whose shoes had never met a cow pat and who wore his confidence like sunscreen, thick and shiny and not entirely rubbed in. He had a name that tasted of forest and concrete at once and he said it without offering it, leaving it to be taken from the air, and the council liaison who had tried to book Kip for free vibrated beside him like a small generator powering hope. CHOICES drifted by in the form of a woman with a clipboard and a relaxed jaw; if you put a hand near her the air felt like the moment a burp is swallowed with shame, and she managed to stand in the shade of nothing. Kip saw them, put them in the corner of his pocket where you put a coin you don\u2019t want to spend without forgetting you have it, and went on retrieving banana peels from bags with gratitude like he was being offered diamonds.\n\nHe began his talk by not talking. He let quiet sit on the grass for a little while, not long enough for anyone to grow bored, just long enough for the gulls to complain that nothing exciting was happening and go elsewhere. He held up a jar of coffee grounds and a jar of orange peels and a handful of eggshells and the small damp body of a cabbage leaf, and he put them one by one into a clear bin as if he were building a cake that no child would recognize as cake until someone sliced it. Then he reached into the tub of finished compost and pulled up a handful of crumbly black that did not clump and did not stink, and he dusted it across the grass in a gentle arc like salting a story and asked people to come smell it, please, right now, with no dignity, with their whole faces.\n\nThere is a trick to making strangers choose to embarrass themselves in a wholesome way, and Kip had been taught it by Aunt Beryl and perfected it in the draught of a city that doesn\u2019t like to be told to pay attention unless it is being offered a free sausage. He took the first few hesitant noses and made them seem brave, he made the laugh that says I\u2019m silly and it\u2019s fine arrive before anyone needed it, and he kept his voice low so people had to lean in and miss nothing. When the first old man made the face and the first child made the gasp and the first woman let her shoulders go in a way that said she had not realized she had been holding them on purpose for years, the thing took itself on like yeast in water, and the crowd ceased to be an audience and became participants in the business of liking rot for the first time in daylight.\n\nHe spoke then, and he did not say decay; he said return. He did not say breakdown; he said back to, and he didn\u2019t make metaphors about death even though he could have balanced five without spilling one. He talked about worms as stomachs that make soil who are also mouths, about bacteria as small workers to whom we owe wages paid in peels and leaves and the patient end of lettuce, and he let people hold worms in their palms if they promised to be quiet with their fingers. He asked the children to name three things they would not eat\u2014no children\u2019s tears, no plastic, no chicken bones\u2014and then asked the same children to name three things their worms would love, and he let the answers be wrong until they weren\u2019t. He could feel Rot-Right settling into its municipal jacket like a dog allowed to stay inside on a wet day for the first time and told not to get on the couch, and every time he felt it lean toward a fear for the taste, he nudged it with a thought the way you nudge a steering wheel to keep a car between the lines.\n\nThere was a wheelie bin in the shade of a peppercorn that should not have been there because nothing should be where it was, and even if Kip hadn\u2019t noticed it with his eyes, Mrs Ipswich\u2019s whisker-twitch would have drawn a thin red line around it in the air. Knife stood beside it with his bad ear forward and his good ear flat and his eyes narrowed as if listening to a small radio station no one had paid to put on the dial. Jet drifted that way because she had the dangerous talent children have for moving toward trouble while looking like they were taking responsibly for a small plant, and Tansy corrected her path with two fingers like a neat wind. A smell in the bin tried to make itself ordinary and overshot; it arrived as sterilized courage and the memory of dentist rooms, and the Anchor\u2019s pin warmed against Kip\u2019s wrist under the band of words and plastic and iron until he wanted to scratch and had to not.\n\nHe did not interrupt his talk about the speed of the worm gut and the dangers of too much citrus in a small system, because panic can be a kind of chemical too. He said, \u201cEveryone rub a little of this\u201d\u2014and he made a cut across his own palm with his voice to give permission\u2014\u201con your wrists where you can smell it later, and you will think nice things about your grandmother who had a garden even if she didn\u2019t. If you don\u2019t have a grandmother, borrow Aunt Beryl, but bring her back in time for cake.\u201d They did it because people like instructions that give them a story to tell about the odd smear on their skin, and the act of putting dirt where perfume goes lodged a small, ridiculous oath in place: remember. He looked at Maureen and she lifted her eyebrows at the bin without moving her head because she did not want to frighten her worms or her guests, and Kip nodded gently and directed his talk so that his moving body put him between the bin and the most persuadable faces.\n\nThe developer made an attempt at sincerity that might have worked in a different town. He held up a worm farm like a prop and talked about circular economies with the rhythm of a man who had memorized the right nouns, and he tried to put a name on what Kip had done that would make it into an asset that could be toured like a model home. Kip let him talk. He smiled with attention and held a worm and corrected a child softly and helped a woman get past a small fear of small cold things, and when the man with the shoes said the words Bio-Opportunity with three hyphens, Aunt Beryl dropped a cake on the table with the force of a sermon and the syllables fell apart and rotted on the grass in a way that made three teenagers laugh into their sleeves. CHOICES fluttered closer as if unwilling to miss an opening, and Kip felt the sedative of forgetting walk past them in sensible shoes and try to shake his hand. He turned his palm at the last moment and had it shake a clod of compost instead, and the small movement was enough to make the council liaison\u2019s smile fall off like a button that had been hanging on by habit.\n\nThey found the bin\u2019s problem without making a scene because the rats had experience with avoiding hysteria in public. Knife leapt light onto Maureen\u2019s table and slapped the hinge of the lid with both paws as if hitting a tambourine, and Tansy took the hint and slid a gloved hand under the rim and held it there long enough for the smell to make a new shape that could be named. Alan stepped in with his best look that said I am a man you do not want to argue with about regulations no matter who you are, and he said, loud enough to make the CHOICES clipboard flinch, \u201cThis is not organic. This is not fit for soil. This is a solvent with a label that has had a label peeled off it, which any fool knows leaves the sticky behind, and I know my stickies. Who brought this into a garden?\u201d\n\nThere is the kind of silence that is an absence, and then there is the kind that is a presence that has put a heavy thing on a table and dares you to say you didn\u2019t see it. The developer\u2019s mouth went into a shape that wanted to be a circle and became a line, and the council man discovered that squinting would not make the old brand name on the bottle\u2019s shoulder un-ghost: MISTRAL 90 in letters that thought they were clean. The CHOICES woman put her clipboard against her chest like a shield and began to say something about intervening when the community begins to hallucinate hazards that are outside its capacity to process, and the Anchor\u2019s pin burned his cuff like breath. Rot-Right pressed its nose against the inside of his teeth like a bored dog who has been very good and sees a ball. Kip breathed dirt into his own throat on purpose and let it scratch.\n\nHe did not make a speech about sabotage. He didn\u2019t need the day to break into sides when it had only just learned to be a circle. He said instead, \u201cSometimes people get confused about what removes and what returns. Sometimes it is an accident and sometimes it is a man in a suit with an old grudge against anything that makes him feel like he has to learn a new word. We don\u2019t have to work out which today.\u201d He took the bottle, which felt offended in his hand, and he set it aside without pomp and asked Maureen to bring the vinegar and the bicarb and the bucket that had been christened for emergencies. He brought the children forward like firefighters with small hands and gave them small jobs with grand titles and kept them talking about their favorite smells while the stinging kind tried to tell their noses a different story and was drowned in domestic charisma. The developer attempted to look helpful and held a funnel, which was probably the first useful thing he had done in months that did not involve a spreadsheet.\n\nAfter they had poured and scrubbed and apologized to the worms for the noise, Maureen took off her hat to scratch and revealed hair like the inside of a tree, and without ceremony she reached down to the edge of the main heap and brought up a stone the size of a loaf of bread that did not look like it had been there yesterday. It had the particular weight of stone carried, a heat under its cool, and its color was the sound of sleep. She didn\u2019t seem surprised by it, and Kip did not need her to be. The You Yang aunties had a habit of sending what was necessary when it was time to stop pretending that volunteers can do everything with cheerful signage. The auntie had signed her work in the curve of the rock, a shallow arc that made your wrist relax when you held it, and in the rounded place on one side where you could set your palm and feel the slow breathing that only hills permit themselves when nobody is watching.\n\n\u201cThat goes under,\u201d Maureen said, with the authority of someone who had been told what to do by people with a view of the bay and had no intention of arguing. \u201cIt will keep the heat from getting silly. It will remind us that we are not the first to play with rot and that we will not be the last. No stickers. No hashtags. Just gratitude.\u201d Kip set the stone at the base of the new heap like a keel, and when his fingers left it, he felt the whole pile sit down comfortably, like a person taking their shoes off at the end of a shift, and he breathed with it and took a little of its calm into a pocket in his chest that had been yawning.\n\nThe council man had more courage once the moment had passed its edge and become administratively solvable. He promised to look into procurement policies with a seriousness that made him look younger, and he took Maureen\u2019s pamphlet about what plants liked coffee and which ones preferred eggshells and said he would give it to his mother. The developer did a thing with his face that was intended to demonstrate magnanimity, and when Aunt Beryl offered him cake he said yes as if accepting charity he was above and then blushed when he realized he had given himself away. CHOICES dissolved into the crowd like sugar in tea and left behind a sweetness that made some people forget to be angry and others remember just in time. Mrs Ipswich reached down and stole a crumb in a way that made three small boys gasp and then giggle and then look around to see if they were supposed to pretend they had not seen a rat be graceful.\n\nThe best thing happened in the corner where the little tubs of finished compost sat like treasure in a museum. Children without prompting began to rub small smears on each other\u2019s wrists as if it were a festival with a ritual they had invented and not told adults about, and they gave each other roles in whispers that sounded very important. They decided that the dirt smell could be a shield against forgetting, and they named themselves Keepers of Filth with the kind of pride that makes a child impervious to mockery for a week. Kip did not interfere with their liturgy; he knew the difference between a game and a spell, and sometimes the game is better at sticking. He laughed deep in his ribs where laughter oils a hinge, and Rot-Right turned over content and took a nap with one ear open.\n\nLater, when the musician boys had finished their love song to compost and tried to segue to an unrelated ballad about a girl named Cass, and For The Love Of Worms had shouted into her hat that the raffle would happen in five minutes and that you could not put down two dollars and call yourself a worm farmer, and the sun slanted itself to make the You Yangs look like guarding dogs, Kip walked over to the fish and chip place at the corner and asked, in the language of men with aprons and burns, whether the trimmings from tonight\u2019s prep could be put into a black bucket and left by a certain grate for a rat queen with ethics. The man behind the counter had the face of someone who had known a lot of secret handshakes between oil and spice and who enjoyed complicated arrangements if they made something taste better. He agreed without making it dramatic, but he did ask if there would be anything in it for him, and Kip offered a discount on guilt that night and a bag of soil in a fortnight that would make his backyard coriander show off. They shook on it with a fishy palm and a hand that smelled like rosemary, and both men went away believing themselves clever.\n\nKip could have gone home then, the sort of home you make when your body knows how to curl itself under tea-tree and not be noticed by anyone with bad ideas. He didn\u2019t, because he had promised himself after the tunnel to take certain kinds of tiredness to water and certain kinds to stone. He followed the bay\u2019s edge until the promenade gave up and turned into ordinary path and then into bald honest earth, and he took the long way around so that he could feel the breath under him change at the places where old piers once had their feet. Tansy fell into step because he had been walking long enough for her to get bored of cleaning cake knives and because she liked the way people made way for her without knowing they were doing it. She had the hoodie up and her hands in the pocket and had not noticed that she had kept her high-vis on, which made her look like an occupational health and safety fairy on unpaid overtime.\n\n\u201cYou were good,\u201d she said, which for her meant she had been proud and had had to not smile where Maureen could see and think she was weak. \u201cYou didn\u2019t try to fix anyone\u2019s soul. You just let them put dirt up their nose and gave it a name that made them not hate themselves. I approve. You smell less like wrong now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had help,\u201d he said, meaning stone and iron and rats and aunties, and also that thing inside him that had sat down like a dog with manners. \u201cI wanted to call it a king again and then I remembered that kings are just men who have avoided being pushed in the mud, and I am not in the mood to flatter men today. The Anchor gave me a pin like a threat. It helps. Also the ring is itchy, which is good. It makes me remember that I am stupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why some people get tattoos,\u201d she said. \u201cSo they keep the moment of pain where they can read it instead of letting it fade into muscle memory. I\u2019m glad you put plastic on it too. The bracelet says you know the world likes to trick you into making the same joke twice in front of people who will never forgive you for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does say that in Comic Sans,\u201d he agreed solemnly, and they stood at the end of Cunningham Pier to watch a little girl swing her legs and repeat in a small private chant the names she had given herself and her friends, Keepers of Filth, Keepers of Filth, until the words skinned themselves of their obvious meanings and became a spell that would keep her from ever buying a bottle of something that claimed to make things go away without cost. Their city moved around them with the cheap grace of a man in a suit trying very hard not to trip on a step and pulling it off and then checking to see who had seen him not fall.\n\nThey went up to the You Yangs the following afternoon because the Anchor had sent a text that consisted of a hill emoji and a spanner and a skull, which in auntie talk meant bring your wrench and your common sense and be prepared to be told you were a clown. Alan drove because he had a ute and because his idea of a good time was bolting a problem to a solution with the wrong tool and then convincing both that they had chosen each other. Jet came with a notebook because her teacher had once told her that field notes were for grown-ups and she had never forgiven that implication. Mrs Ipswich refused a seat on the dashboard and instead rode in the tray with the joy of someone who had discovered that rat balance and a human vehicle made for a fine ride if you didn\u2019t mind the occasional bump that felt like a new idea.\n\nThe stone aunties met them by pretending not to be there. They let the city recede, and they brought birds in close, and the air had weight that anyone foolish would call oppressive and anyone sensible would feel in their ankles with gratitude. They did not step out of the rock because that would have made for a spectacle and the aunties did not perform for cousins. They made a particular sound instead, a clack like someone tapping a chain against a fence to call a dog home from the far side of mischief, and Kip stood still so that his skin could hear it and then moved forward with the caution of a man going into a room of women whose photographs stand on mantelpieces he is not in.\n\nThey told him what he knew and then they told him what he didn\u2019t. They told him his ring was ugly enough to be useful and the plastic bracelet was a good insult to the right people and that he should not give up that habit. They told him Rot-Right would sulk if ignored and hence should be fed like a cousin who has moved in unexpectedly, which is to say with respect and leftovers, and that if he had to choose between going under alone because a child was drowning and waiting for permission, he should bring the child up and apologize later to his elders for being built like a rescue. They told him not to give his new job to the council without ensuring that whoever took it had a grandmother who had dirt under her nails at least once. They told him there would be more of the solvent kind because someone had money for it and an idea of what clarity should smell like, and that the name of the man might begin with a letter that likes to lean.\n\nAlan wandered off and found a bolt that didn\u2019t belong to the hill and looked at it the way men looked at old photographs of themselves, and Jet wrote down the fact that when you sit on a particular rock, it presses the ache in your back into a shape that feels like a hand and that this is not terrifying if you have been loved before. Tansy listened with her hood up and knew that half the boys she had kissed would not have heard any of it and felt suddenly less lonely for it. Mrs Ipswich ran up and down a crack with the look of a creature inspecting property, considered the possibility of a holiday home in granite, and decided her people preferred bins with lids large enough to declare an ideology.\n\nWhen they came down, the bay\u2019s color had changed three times while they had been held, and Kip could feel the city\u2019s appetite for story pushing at him like a friend with an elbow. He did not go into a drain. He went to the fishmonger with his bucket that had acquired a designation it did not know it had desired, and he accepted trimmings with the respect owed to parts that had once been part of someone\u2019s supper in the making. He walked along the safe corridor after dark and set the bucket down like an offering, and Mrs Ipswich turned up with a committee and said a blessing in a language that had been invented that day and would be forgotten in the morning except by those who keep minutes where the feet go.\n\nRot-Right stood at his shoulder and sniffed and made polite eyes at the fish and then looked at him to make sure, because rules are like leashes, and you can love the hand that holds them or hate it. He pressed his hand to the grate and let the iron ring bruise him a little to give the yes weight. He said, not aloud, not whispered, just breathed the idea so that it fogged and cleared on its own, we feed, not frenzy. The taste of it came back as agreed, and he carried that agreement all the way up through his arm into the bed he made of ordinary and slept like a man who had done a day\u2019s work and would do another. He dreamed, inevitably, of worms with badges, of rats in hi-vis, of children reminding their parents to put orange peels in a bucket, and of a stone laughing so low that no one could be offended, only steadied, which is the kind of laugh that keeps a city together when it would prefer to get new shoes and run away.\n\nThe next week taught him that every ritual becomes a rota, which is how you know it is working and also how you know it will wear people down if you do not let it be funny. He put reminders in his phone with emojis he had to pretend to himself he did not find adorable; he let Alan bully a foreman into installing a proper grate on the west side by using the words liability exposure like a weapon; he took three calls from the council man who now referred to himself as a champion of urban composting in emails and only smiled a little with his teeth. He walked past the bath most mornings and touched the handrail with two fingers because the tiles liked that, and he could feel the different kind of clean that comes when someone has kept a promise to not remove but return. He held his iron ring when CHOICES left a flyer at Aunt Beryl\u2019s declaring that the council offered free consultations for people who found themselves obsessed with drains beyond a healthy concern, and he did not ring and he did not throw it away; he put it in the drawer with the batteries so that the next time he needed to power something, he would take out the flyer and laugh like a person who knows exactly where his weaknesses are because he has named them.\n\nHe and Tansy went under with Alan and Jet and sometimes Maureen and occasionally one of the older men from the garden who had been convinced that the drains were a place like a shed, with rules and handy shelves, and they took paint in buckets and wrote in places only rain could read, and the rain read and it did not forget. They scrubbed where the solvent kind sulked and made themselves a chore list that would have been depressing if it had not been broken into parts named after cakes. They learned the names of new rats because Mrs Ipswich had decided that municipal jobs came with performance reviews and gossip, and that if you wanted to move your family into a good pipe, you had to show you could take a joke about the time you ate an entire packet of jelly snakes and did not sleep for three days.\n\nOn the day he was due to talk to a room full of men who liked ties and counted their worth in carparks about the joys of rot, Kip put his hat on and then took it off and put his iron-and-plastic wrist between his teeth for a second the way people do to make themselves threaten to cry and then not. He thought about bringing the stone auntie to the meeting and laughed out loud at the picture of himself walking in with a boulder under his arm and breaking a shoe. He took his bucket of good dirt and his jar of live worms and the honest smell that makes suits pretend they cannot smell anything because they have to pretend they are above their noses, and he went to speak not as a boy apologizing for being clever but as a citizen inviting other citizens to put their hands in a future that would feed them. He did not plan his jokes because planning ruins them; he planned his silences and his spoon, and he decided that if anyone said Bio-Opportunity again, he would hand them a worm with the solemnity usually reserved for godchildren, and then he would stop because there are rules, and also because Aunt Beryl had promised to hex his ears if he refused to accept that sometimes charm is cruel when applied correctly.\n\nThe minute before he opened his mouth, he felt a rich current of sour-with-purpose slide along his ribs and nest in the hollow where his breath sits. Rot-Right had woken up for a speech. Kip did not bat it away or invite it to share the microphone. He sat it in the front row of his mind and told it to take notes, and when the men with ties laughed the second time, he let himself believe that they could learn something that would make the drains not a secret but a pride, and that belief felt like heat slipping into a cold room without being able to say its name.He did not open with a joke, though his mouth could have done it with his eyes closed and his hands occupied with worms. He opened with work, which is the safer cousin of charm. He tipped a small ribbon of coffee grounds into a clear box and then a layer of shredded paper that had once been council pamphlets and then a confetti of lettuce that had gone from crisp to sorry, and he did it like someone teaching sleep to a baby: unhurried, confident, ordinary magic that doesn\u2019t need clapping. He let his voice be warm without projecting, because power that doesn\u2019t strain often does more damage and more good, and he said the same small true thing three times in three ways so it could fit into different ears. Return is not rot being disgusting; return is gratitude in slow motion. Worms are stomachs and mouths and also citizens with a job to do. If you put in what they like, they will make you something you can run your hands through without thinking about what it used to be and without apologizing to anyone in your head.\n\nThey laughed first at each other, which is always a better sign than laughing at you. The man with the polish on his shoes let it be known that he could do humility by bending over and peering into the clear box as if it were a rare painting, and Kip kept his face soft and said something bland about ratios that did two jobs: it let the man talk to his own discomfort about dirt, and it reminded everyone else that there was a way to be smug about banana peels if you needed to be. A woman with neat hair and a badge that said Community Partnerships put her palm over the tub of finished compost like a fortune-teller and asked what she was supposed to see, and Kip put a handful into her hand without warning her properly because the best way to cut the ribbon on a new idea is to put it where skin is, and when she smiled despite herself, he felt Rot-Right stretch under his ribs like a dog who has been told it is allowed on the couch this once.\n\nThe developer stood with his body turned half towards the sea and half towards the crowd, as if he were on the verge of introducing them to each other and hoping not to be blamed if they didn\u2019t get along. He talked about systems. He said the word circular so many times it rolled off his tongue and became a wheel and tried to crush nuance under it, and when he said Bio-Opportunity Kip heard Aunt Beryl laugh in his memory and saw, out of the corner of his eye, Tansy take the measure of the man with one glance and shelf him under people who would refuse to use a mug twice if it had washed and dried between. The council liaison stood inside his own smile like a man wearing a wetsuit one size too small, and CHOICES drifted like a cool current in a room that had no water, the woman with the clipboard keeping just far enough away to not interact and close enough to be the shadow of a good idea.\n\nHe gave them a small trick because you have to feed audiences something sweet before you hand them vegetables. He showed them how to use a spoon to move worms gently without making themselves feel like murderers. He told the story of a boy who had brought his worm farm to school and watched with astonishment as the boy everyone thought was cruel stood for fourteen minutes without swatting a single fly and then went home and asked his mother if they could learn to make less. He did not say the boy was him; he put the boy into the room and let the men with ties wear him for a moment without liking how it fit, and he made them laugh at their own seriousness. When they laughed the second time, he let it be his invitation to say two things that might have sounded scolding if they hadn\u2019t been wrapped in dirt that smelled like cake: don\u2019t put citrus peels in until the system is older; don\u2019t call a thing clean because you can\u2019t smell it.\n\nWhen the questions came, they came with the particular tilt of heads that says we want your expertise inside our spreadsheet without you in the meeting where we allocate funds. How do you scale? Who holds risk? What will you do when the community loses interest? He answered like a person who had known what a ledger was since he could count and had always refused to let it decide whether a story was worth telling. You scale by multiplying small good habits and then doing what is necessary to make sure they are not punished. You hold risk the way you hold a jar full of sourdough starter: carefully, with a towel under in case of overflow, with respect for the exponential. Communities lose interest when they are not allowed to be funny; keep the humor in and the carrots tend themselves. Rot-Right paced once up and back under his heart as he said it, and he put his thumb against the iron and the plastic and the pin to keep the pacing from turning into a dash.\n\nAfterwards, when the worm-handling had devolved into a sort of low-key sacrament and Maureen had sold so many transparent boxes that she had started warning people against themselves, the developer made his move. He invited Kip to say soil with him in a little knot of men who kept looking over their shoulders at the bay like singled people at a wedding considering leaving early. He spoke about pilot programs and deliverables and thought he was doing Kip a favor by letting him see the engine room. Kip listened as if the words were rain and he was under a properly maintained verandah. He said thank you in the tone that means I understand that we have different jobs and mine isn\u2019t to be your conscience or your free marketing, and he smiled with his teeth under his lips, which is the way to smile when you want to remind a man that you have canine molars too and you just choose, most days, not to bite.\n\nCHOICES came in sideways, the clipboard held like a shield with rounded corners. She didn\u2019t introduce herself by any name that would stick; she introduced herself by service, which is a way of saying hello without being held to it later. We can help, she said without moving her mouth much, when the community begins to report\u2026 distortions. We have procedures. We can keep the brand clean. The word brand turned into a piece of plastic in Kip\u2019s mouth that his tongue could not push to the side, and for a moment he wanted to spit with a shocking lack of manners and see if anyone tried to ticket him. He didn\u2019t. He put his hand into the tub of compost again and then touched his own wrist where the skin was thinner and made dirt into a bracelet to match the LiveStrong and the iron. I don\u2019t want clean, he said with unembarrassed softness. I want honest. If you take away the complications I can work with, you leave me with a flat surface and a reflection. He thought she might break; she smiled instead and said, we are always here if you become overwhelmed by context, and the quiet threat of that sentence sat like a moth in his mouth until he breathed it out while bending to talk to a five-year-old about how worms cannot eat Lego.\n\nWhen it was done, when the teenagers had stopped playing long enough to find dignity in how much they had sweated and the council man had taken his mother\u2019s pamphlet and put it in his pocket like contraband because leaving it in his hand would have made it less likely to be read, he took his bucket and his hands and walked the perimeter to make sure everyone was leaving with ideas that weren\u2019t going to make Maureen swear later. Rot-Right hummed like a refrigerator does\u2014a constant small presence that becomes alarming only when it stops\u2014and when the hum shifted once to a higher pitch, he gave his neck a little twist and saw, the way you see water move under a breeze you didn\u2019t feel, the bin under the peppercorn where the solvent man had tried to make an idea. He found himself grateful that insult had been defeated in daylight and by vinegar. It suggested that the next move would be after dark and harder and that he should make sure his spectacles were clean, which is what Aunt Beryl calls the kind of thinking you put on when the obvious lies down.\n\nHe did not get to sit with that thought long enough to box it and label it for later because the sky did something deliberate. The bay is unashamed of weather; it lets its moods show. The breeze came up with fewer jokes in it. The light found a color it hadn\u2019t been wearing. On the fringe of the gardens, the peppercorn trees rubbed their scent together like anxious people warming their hands, and someone said in the comfortable tone of a man who has always distrusted forecasts and is now delighted to be a prophet, that\u2019ll be a storm then. Kip looked south and saw the line of dark coming like a teacher back to school after a strike, and he turned to the table nearest him and began the sort of sensible abrupt packing that saves cake and headphones and also pride.\n\nIt was not a storm that came to tidy. It was one that came to find where your house had been built poorly and tell everyone. The first drops hit the skin like a warning and then forgot themselves and became a slap; the smell on the air folded lemon in with wet wool. Maureen covered her worm tubs with practiced hands and called to two boys who had not yet learned to be embarrassed about sprinting to put the signs away, and the council man stood for a moment with his tie doing a small dance and then took it off with a look of a man who had been waiting years for the moment when he would tell his tie to behave and it would not. Tansy put Jet into a jacket that would have kept a seal pup smug and grabbed the cake box as if it were a small child which, in a town like this, it nearly was. Kip lifted the tub of finished compost like a baby and held onto his hat with the other hand and laughed because the world had decided to be interesting at an inconvenient time and there is a kink in him that loves that.\n\nHe was halfway to the shed when the first roar came up from the stormwater that belied the polite name. It said, I have been waiting in pipes and I will now speak, and people who have never listened to drains before heard it and looked towards the low places where footpaths become small creeks and then big ones. He thought of the writing they had put in places only rain could read, the letters that told water the old paths and asked it to take them. He put the tub down and put his hands on the nearest grate the way a person puts their palms on a friend\u2019s shoulders when they want to talk to them seriously, and he sent his voice down into the rush with the shapes that make directions without sounding like commands. The iron ring heated with friction he wasn\u2019t making with motion, and the pin the Anchor had set in his cuff burned a line against his kitchen-self until he wanted to wrestle it off and throw it in the bay and then go down after it and apologize.\n\nRot-Right woke fully, without yawning, and put its weight into the corners of him like a person bracing furniture before a door when someone knocks too hard. It wanted to take taste from what was coming up, and he did not forbid that, he redirected it the way you give a child a carrot when they ask for sugar. Not fear, he told it, not breath. Take the swill. Take the kitchen. Leave the ankles. It heard him because the iron made his voice sit heavy enough for it to take it seriously. Across the lawn, Alan had seen the same change and was already moving with the conviction that turns men into warnings; he ended up at the west side, where the weak bracket had finally given up on its responsibilities. He had the new one in his hand, not because he had expected exactly this moment, but because people like Alan carry the solution to two likely problems at all times and a willingness to lie about whether they knew they\u2019d need it.\n\nThe first surge over the curb brings glamour to places that don\u2019t often get it, and children briefly make sounds that make mothers draw in breath without scolding, but the second will take a foot if it can. The bath at Eastern Beach obeyed its own logic and slopped at the edges like a big bowl carrying too much soup. Una was there without being seen to arrive, her tattoos ready for a fight and her whistle in the key of attention cuts through rain, and she put rope in hands before the hands knew they wanted it. A line formed right of nothing and wrong became a plan, and people held each other as if holding were a job. Kip did not go to the bath; he went under. It would have been a story to say he forgot to bring anyone. He didn\u2019t. He lifted his hand to come and then dropped it because Tansy was shoving Jet into a safer place and Aunt Beryl was tying down a tent with a rope and Alan had his bracket and Maureen was busy seducing worms into staying home. He said out loud to the storm the two words that make the difference between arrogance and practice, coming back, and then he went down.\n\nThe drain had the voice of a thing happy to be what it was; under a storm, that voice can drown the bright bit of you if you haven\u2019t eaten enough, and Kip had, that day, in cake and praise and urgency. The rain read the letters they had painted the week before with a solemnity that made him want to hug Jet for naming it the silliest thing at the time, and the water took the old path where they had asked it to, which is to say that what had been a trick became a rule for a little while and that was enough. He made his light small so he wouldn\u2019t see everything and put his palm on the tunnel wall and let his breath match the rush and then the long, and when the tug came at his ankles that said you could go now and be a story of someone we say an elegant thing about, he pressed the iron to his teeth and concentrated on terrible small truths like the names of his toes and the fact that he had left the kettle on a thousand times and never burned the house and that Aunt Beryl had once let a cake fall and had sworn at it with affection.\n\nThe smell that came wasn\u2019t Rot\u2019s. It was the other one, the removal one, and it came bright, clean, false, as if someone had put a lemon in their mouth and told you they had tasted the sea. It came with the sound a hospital makes at two in the morning when everything is fine and then you think about it and nothing is fine. It didn\u2019t want to eat; it wanted to dissolve. It wanted to make the boundaries go away so that nothing had to be counted and no one had to look at the smear and say I did that. It smelled like the word pristine when it has been put on a brochure with a picture of water that has forgotten it is made of time. Kip felt Rot-Right flinch, not because it was afraid, but because it knew an insult when it met one. He pulled it back by the scruff in his mind and set it to the edges as if this were a pastry that needed to stop its leak. The solvent smell slid past his nose and tried to hide inside his sense of relief and he thought, with uncharacteristic clarity, no, you are not a kindness, and named it for himself in the privacy of his head: Away.\n\nIt didn\u2019t like that. It did not live in names; it lived in the spaces between words where responsibility fades out because everyone is tired. It poured itself towards him with the intent of a hand with a cloth and he held up his iron like it could be more than metaphor and it was, for the length of a breath, enough. It hissed against the ring as if you could make a sound with an idea when you don\u2019t have teeth, and he made himself heavy as stone. He thought of the aunties who had put a rock in the worm pile and how the whole coil of heat there had sat down like sense finally heard, and he made that weight inside himself on purpose in a way he had never had to do before so that he would not become a light thing that can be carried off.\n\nThe rain found his back and made him into slope and culvert, and if he had not heard Alan\u2019s particular cursing from the mouth of the drain a long way off he might have let the arms of the water carry him three inches and then six and then he would have had to be clever in a way that is not compatible with keeping your own breath. He fixed his feet. He made his light a little bigger not for himself but for the thing that wanted to see where it could be useful and he said, not to Rot-Right and not to Away and not to the storm but to the brick and the old flow and the smell of tallow that the place had not yet given up, remember your job. The brick did, because brick is reliable when you don\u2019t ask it to do more than hold. The old flow remembered the river. The tallow remembered fat that had fed people who had cried when they thought about being dammed, and that sadness, being honest, made the remove-idea jump back as if it had put a hand on something hot by mistake.\n\nHe found the smear that had not dissolved the week before because it had not been asked to; it glowed in his small light with the satisfaction of a stain that has been given attention and thinks it means it will be kept. He put his hand very near it without touching because there are ways to be intimate with horror that do not involve bodily fluids, and he pushed the thought at it that Aunt Beryl has taught him to use when a person shows up with a casserole that is mostly guilt and wants to be thanked. Not here. We are busy. Take your story somewhere else. It did not go because he had told it so; it went because the rain reading their letters made the tunnel into a throat that wasn\u2019t interested in being burned and chose a different gulp.\n\nWhen he came up, the world had more edges in it. The air made needles of itself against his cheeks and he laughed, not out of bravery but as if he had almost fallen off a bike and for a second had thought of the blood and then had not bled and your body insists on celebrating the absence. Una was a shape in the slanting rain, her strong hands holding rope, the rope holding people, the people holding each other. Tansy stood with her hoodie stuck to her skull like kelp and her eyes narrow and her mouth old and kind and mean, which is to say she was doing the work of being clever while tired. Jet had a whistle and was not using it, which is proof that children can be saints when their hands are full. Alan stood with one knee in a puddle and a bracket installed so cleanly that an inspector would have wept, and he had the particular rigor mortis of men who have been right at the exact right time and are now ridiculous about it.\n\nThe meltdown after a storm is always a little stupid. Everyone wants to tell their small version of heroism to the nearest person with a face and the people with faces don\u2019t want to hear it yet. They stood under a bit of tin that had not been asked to shelter more than one person at once for twenty years and shared heat like mammals. Aunt Beryl took a rollcall without pretending she wasn\u2019t doing it and then handed out cake from the box she had saved like a contraband rosary, and because humans are very easily led, the act of putting something sweet into a wet mouth convicted them of survival and told their bodies to calm down. The council man looked at his hands as if they had done something he had not budgeted for and then shook his head once and went to get more rope because he had learned something he didn\u2019t know where to put and the easiest place was back into his hands, and CHOICES stood with the kind of posture that says we can help anyone who will sign this form in the rain.\n\nKip found he was shivering not because cold but because everything had put away its edges too quickly and his body had nowhere to put the spare. He put his iron against his face and let it be colder than he was, and when he went to find Aunt Beryl because he needed the kind of telling off that feels like you are being wrapped in a towel, he walked into the Anchor instead and thought, briefly and idiotically, that perhaps he had become her, because there is a moment when you meet your anchor and your shape relaxes around it with the inevitability of a bag of flour finding the shape of its jar. She stood with rain-line hair and needles sticking out of a ball of knitting like weaponry and eyes like safe places, and she did not make a joke about how he smelled, though she could have. She nodded once and put a wet hand on his wet cheek and said, which is to say pronounced, because some words are court orders in their softness, that will come again not because you failed but because it is made of people. He wanted to argue for the luxury of blame and could not because she did not leave space for indignity.\n\nHe told her about Away without using the name he had thought in his head, because sometimes names work two ways and he had no reason to send a calling card. He told her about the hiss at the iron and the way it had slid into his sense of relief like a thief in a convenience store pretending to be staff. She frowned with satisfaction because being right is also a job when you are old and she had been hoping he would see it. The aunties said don\u2019t name that one yet, she said as if it had been said on a piece of wind and lodged in her shawl. Make a box and write do not open until you have a broom big enough to hit it with. In the meantime, do what you have been doing, which is tie rules to everything that will accept a knot. Teach your dog to sit in rooms full of meat without embarrassing you. Feed it. Don\u2019t let it eat people\u2019s small shocks. And when the men with solvent come with clipboards, send them to me. I have a tone of voice that makes a foreman lie down with a headache.\n\nHe did as he was told not because he is obedient generally but because he has chosen his queens with care. The storm ran out of drama and sat down, and the light did that thing the bay\u2019s light does after it has been showing off, where it settles into the work of making shape and line visible. They walked home without stories, which is one of the best ways to walk in a town like this; it leaves the air uncluttered for the next thing. He slept hard and not sensible, too tired to be political with his own dreams, and woke with the taste of metal and rosemary in his mouth, which he decided to take as a benediction in Aunt Beryl\u2019s dialect.\n\nJet\u2019s school carnival landed in the middle of the week like a boisterous aunt sitting on an arm of the couch not meant to hold a person. Kip went because he liked the way school events turned the day into a festival and because Jet had said, casually in a tone carefully oiled to not beg, that it would be good if someone who could pull a girl out of a water with laughter stood near the shallow end. He put on a big shirt that made him look like an uninteresting adult and wore his iron like it was jewelry because sometimes you need to train the part of you that wants to vanish into behaving like a person. It wasn\u2019t magical, the day; it was ordinary in a way that heals. He bought a sausage in bread from a father who had not wanted to grill and had done it anyway because masculinity is a chore, and he put sunscreen on a child who was not his, and he clapped for learners who came last and did not cry, and he felt Rot-Right sit and watch and obey the rule about children because rules are habits if you feed them.\n\nHe did one small stupid thing because he is not a saint. A man in sunglasses with a voice that had been taught by talk radio said something about the smell at the shallow end in a tone like a suggestion of court and then laughed when his friend flinched at the taste of pre-boiled water, and Kip, who has empathy in muscle but not always perfect impulse control, flicked the air by the man\u2019s ear with a finger until the smell of dirt crept into his nostril and made him smile against his will. The man laughed wrong and then right, and it was petty and it was not noble, and there are few pleasures so clean. Tansy saw him do it and waited until after to kick his ankle, not to hurt but to mark. He nodded and said sorry you\u2019re right out loud in front of the kiosk because there are some apologies that should be witnessed so they can\u2019t be retracted later in memory, and she patted his shoulder roughly as if shoving him into his better self.\n\nThe solvent men did not rest, and neither did the part of the city that aligns itself with clean lines without context. The day after the storm, a boy in a high-vis vest who had the look of someone who had been told good news and then discovered the fine print found a box left under the west bridge with a label that had had a label peeled off. Alan opened it with the care you give a bomb or a wedding invitation, depending on your temperament, and found six bottles with translucent liquid that smelled of virtue and hospital floors. There was no official logo, but the glass bore the ghost of an old brand, and the lid had a scratch shaped like an L, which might have been nothing and might have been the letter that likes to lean. Kip took one in his hand and his stomach clenched like you have when you see a dog going to run across a busy road and you are too far away to make a difference, and he looked at the boy who had found it and saw in him that terrible thing cities do to young men where they become proud of their proximity to danger. He took the pride away gently by putting trouble in his own pocket and replacing it with a job that had a title that sounded important: liaison.\n\nIt is satisfying to discover that your enemy has a logo. It makes you believe in the shape of the fight. Kip did not give himself this. He put the bottle in Aunt Beryl\u2019s kitchen because kitchens can transfigure villains into ingredients when you are careful, and he stood there with his hands empty like someone demonstrating contrition to a god he has chosen and said, we need to know how it works before it isn\u2019t allowed to. Aunt Beryl, who had in her time put lye and vinegar within an inch of each other and taught them to behave or be separated indefinitely, sniffed at the top and pinched her face in a way that had once made men in aprons leave knives on benches. She poured a drop\u2014not into the sink, which would have been a conversation with a drain that did not need more gossip, but onto a plate that had once been a roof tile and had been kept for occasions where you wouldn\u2019t be sad if you melted your crockery. The drop sat on the tile and made a noise so soft you only heard it if you liked secrets, and then it did what it was built for, which is take away, and it took away the memory of what had been on the tile before and left behind a scratch.\n\nThey learned its rules the way you learn the rules of a sad dog you are determined to love because he is family. It did not eat fat properly; it spread it thinner, like shame. It did not like salt unless given sweetness first. It made paper look like it could not possibly have held words. It turned certain plastics lively in a way that made Tansy swear and put all the Easter tubs on top of the fridge to be dealt with when the council had made up its mind to buy a fire. It did not understand how to be kind about flesh; it could be persuaded to leave alone what had learned to be skin at the expense of other possibilities, but it required loud talk and iron and the steady hand of someone who could put their faith in the fact of edges. You could teach it, in small. You could not trust it in distance.\n\nThey sat with the You Yang aunties again without needing to drive, which is to say the aunties came down into the air and the feel of granite settled into the day like a smell you associate with someone you love. Stone doesn\u2019t talk about chemicals; it talks about what they want to do. The aunties said, as if remarking on weather in a tone that was still a warning, that the one that removes will try to become a law. It will try to persuade men who have never opened a jar of preserves in their lives that they have always wanted air they don\u2019t have to breathe. It will wear words like clear and crisp and pure, and people will nod because they are tired of being animals. They said you cannot fight a slogan with three paragraphs. You have to give a different word to the same feeling and make it stick when the body is under strain. They said you name it Away in your own head and you call what you love Near out loud until children repeat it in playgrounds and it becomes rude to say anything else.\n\nHe named the near things. He named them in small places where men with neat hair could not ask for a copy of the minutes. He told Jet that when she swam she was putting her body into Near and that if she felt a sleek come to roll under her and make her think she wanted to stand on a tile and leave, she should call that a trick and not a wish. He told Mrs Ipswich that the corridor of pipe that ran from Maureen\u2019s worm fairyland to the river was Near and that if she met anything there that made her whiskers stiffen like she wanted to sneeze, she should slap its idea of itself and make a scandal, because scandal is Near\u2019s way of keeping people honest. He told Tansy that his mouth was Near when she kissed him, which he said as a joke and then wasn\u2019t, and she thumped his shoulder without hitting his iron and said don\u2019t flirt with me when I\u2019m on shift because I will either ignore you or marry you out of spite.\n\nA week after worm day, the developer held a walk-through along the water with men and women who say phrases like activation and place-making without being ashamed that anyone can hear them. He brought his son, which is always the most dangerous kind of camouflage because sons will not do the decent thing and stand where their fathers put them; they go to the places where the smell is most interesting. Kip was not invited but he is nearly impossible to uninvite from his own city, and he took a clipboard from CHOICES without asking because it is harder for people to make you leave if you look like you belong to the bureaucracy. He walked three steps behind the group and put his ear down every now and then to listen to a bolt or a bracket so Alan would feel included, and when the son made his inevitable move towards the lip of a drain that was trying to have a conversation with the storm that had left, Kip met him halfway with the silly hat and said come look at a rat corridor instead, you\u2019ll see something better than a dead thing.\n\nIt was Mrs Ipswich\u2019s time to make trouble elegant. She had stationed her younger girls along the corridor with a sense of theatre and a sign in chalk that said RATS ONLY and then smaller underneath you can watch if you don\u2019t touch and then smaller underneath with a drawing of a hand with a red cross through it because sometimes you have to be patronising. The boy put his face against the grate the way children put their faces against windows, and the rats obligingly did rat things that make children honest, like washing their hands with their own little paws vigorously enough that anyone prejudiced against them is forced to admit they are not beholden to stereotypes. The boy laughed with the sound of a family\u2019s money falling off his shoulders for half a minute, and the developer\u2019s face did an unreadable thing and then settled into something we might kindly call surprise. CHOICES drifted forward with a pamphlet that promised to remove any unpleasant images from your child\u2019s long-term memory for a small fee, and the son said without irony, as if he had spent his life rehearsing to be useful, I want to remember this, and Kip felt savage affection for him the way you feel for a kitten that has accidentally clawed the face of a man who needed it.\n\nThe solvent men made their mistake that evening, which is to say they made their inevitability early and this is useful for stories. They poured their clean into a place they thought no one would see\u2014an underpass near the old woolstores where the air had acquired a memory of bodies and where the walls were layered with graffiti that had been clever and then been painted over by the city and then pressed back under in newer colours that had not yet learned to hold. It should have gone away, the paint, under solvent\u2019s hand; that is the promise removal makes. It did not, because the people who had made the jokes in colour had also made them in shape, and rain had read them and water remembers when asked. What the solvent did was pull the pigment into a wetness, and then because it was too proud to trickle, it slid and pooled and made a slick that reflected faces in a way that made you believe you would forget yours and then discover you had not.\n\nThey went with brooms and buckets and vinegar again because this is a city that knows how to repeat the useful processes until someone builds a ritual out of them. They went with a stone from the aunties because the You Yangs like to put their weight where it will be felt, and they set the stone down where the solvent had made a gleam and told the gleam to be tired. Maureen came with a kid who had been making microscopic friends in a jar since she was four and now had a tray of bacteria that could eat things it shouldn\u2019t have known the names of, and she poured them with reverence and a disgust that was part of her piety. Alan brought a bracket just in case and ended up using it for nothing, which is the purest joy of a prepared man. Jet brought a whistle and this time blew it because she wanted to see if the tone would make the gleam forget itself, and it did, a little, because sound has mass if you aim it right.\n\nKip did not name the solvent thing aloud. He told it what it could not have\u2014not children, not courage, not bold colours that had been jokes about politicians and hearts and lovemaking on picnic tables\u2014and he fed Rot-Right a diet as carefully curated as an oncologist\u2019s protocol: old fat, coffee, leaves, the honorable end of lettuce. He said Near to everything with edges until he was annoying even to himself, and then he said it again and made it funny so that people could copy it without feeling like they were signing a treaty. The CHOICES woman stood in the half light with a clipboard she did not write on and looked as if she wanted to say we can fix this and then remembered the rule someone had taught her once about not promising what you can\u2019t do in front of press. The council man showed up with a truck and four teenagers in vests and a painter\u2019s mask and said tell me where to stand and did not make a speech about consultation, and Kip turned his face sideways so the man wouldn\u2019t see how much he liked him at that moment because he did not want to add to anyone\u2019s burdens with his own gratitude.\n\nHe slept hard after that because people do. He woke in the middle of the night because cats fight at two and three and the city has never liked to do anything privately. He sat up without sitting up and felt under his rib the curious sensation of being sung to by something with no throat. It did not feel like Rot-Right; it didn\u2019t feel like Away; it felt like water laughed sideways through a pipe. He went to the window and saw nothing but the black of weather to come, and then on the sill he saw two marks like lines made by a child who cannot yet be trusted with pen and wall. They were in salt, which is the You Yangs\u2019 handwriting when they can\u2019t be bothered with granite, and the lines were this shape: a plumb bob and a hook.\n\nThe aunties were, in their way, interested in his promise not to go under alone. They had sent a counterweight and a way to steal. A plumb is not fancy; it is a string with a weight at the end that points only in one direction. A hook is a hook. He took the message into his pocket and lay down and did not pretend that he would not fail his promise at some point when breath was at stake. He made instead the smaller vow that he would fail it cleanly and tell on himself quickly and wear whatever iron he was given without sulking in front of children. The idea that he couldn\u2019t save everyone had become in the last few weeks less like a spear and more like a spoon; it was still sharp, but he had learned to eat with it.\n\nMorning broke like something made of sugar and starch; it held together because everyone was too tired to poke it before coffee. He was at Aunt Beryl\u2019s before she had five minutes to be offended by his hair, and he cleaned the stove with a cloth no one would miss while she pretended she needed his help and then let him steal a handful of the ends of a cake that had been trimmed to look square for a man who thought geometry could be tasted. The iron itched like thought. The plastic bracelet caught the cuff of his shirt and made him swear in a way that would have offended the man who had invented it in a different decade, and Aunt Beryl looked at his wrist and sniffed again and then kissed her teeth at him like a cat making an opinion. You\u2019re getting good at this, she said as if she meant something else as well, and he considered the interesting possibility of being good at not being special and found himself suspicious of how much he liked it.\n\nHe saw the developer again that day because cities are loops and men who want to build have to walk the same rocks as men who want to keep. The man had a small dog with comedic eyebrows that announced his wife had a sense of humor and that he was trying to borrow it. He talked about setbacks as if he were rehearsing for a panel and said the phrase reputational risk with a long enough vowel that Kip could have threaded it on a string. Kip said I am happy to help if help means making a mess in daylight that we then clean up together, and the man looked at him as if he had spoken Latin and then barked with laughter because the dog had farted at exactly the moment when language did not work. It is rude and true that what you need to make citizens out of consumers is often an embarrassing noise and a bag.\n\nThe afternoon brought small chores: convincing a butcher to save bones in a separate bin because the rats had opinions about marrow; having an argument with a teenager with a skateboard about whether the gold paint that said you are loved looked better in italics or bold; talking to a woman whose son had decided he wanted to be a plumber because drains are chatty and being decent about her fears of trades; telling Maureen that no, not all coffee shops will give you their grounds if you stare at them hard, you need to smile and promise to mention them on a signboard and then do it twice. He did each thing with the same attention he would have given to saving a child, which is how you make a town that doesn\u2019t resent being lectured at, and every time he wanted to be clever merely for the pleasure of feeling the edges of it he put his fingers under the iron until the itch put him back into a body.\n\nWhen night laid itself down on the city like a reasonable blanket and people gave themselves permission to be smaller in a room with a door, he took the plumb bob and the hook to the bridge because not doing so would have ached worse than the iron. He did not tell anyone because nobody answers their phone at ten without a question that hurts, and he did not go under alone because he had learned that if you go under alone, you have to keep your first promise every ten seconds like a religious chant and you forget to listen. He texted Alan a photo of the plumb with a spanner emoji and a skull, which was their agreed-upon code for I\u2019m doing a thing and it has bones in it and if I don\u2019t text again in ten minutes you may break things in my defense. Alan responded immediately with a picture of a bolt and a heart and then the letter L in a font that leaned and Kip laughed and went.\n\nIt was different in the after of a storm and a near miss. The tunnels held their breath in the way of beasts resting on elbows, and the smell of Away hung thin as if it had been told to go sit in the corner and think about what it had done. He hung the plumb bob from a pipe and didn\u2019t think about the fact that he was loitering in a place that had no use for the word loiter. The string knew what it wanted; it found down like a dog finds the boy it lives with in a crowd. He held the hook in his left hand like a thief. When you steal from water you don\u2019t take, you borrow and put back, and you have to be braver than clever, and he is just enough of both.\n\nThe plumb settled over a place that looked like every other place and wasn\u2019t. The air there clicked against his teeth like a battery, and the concrete had a stain shaped not by accident but by design, and the design was a logo he had seen without understanding it, and now he did, and for a fragile, delicious, dangerous moment he felt the joy of patterns collapsing into a picture. The L tilted just so, the scratch on the bottle lid magnified to a graffiti. He put his hook under the seam of thought where the solvent men had pried time open and he lifted like you lift a scab when you know it will bleed and are gross and honest enough to do it anyway, and the panel of space that had been thin turned over like a flap on an Advent calendar, and behind it there was not chocolate.\n\nThere was a room. He stood in a tunnel and opened not a door; he tilted a thing one degree and then two and found himself looking through air at a space that had decided to capture itself. It wasn\u2019t big in the way architects think of big; it was large the way a lie is large. It held shelving and boxes and those bottles he would have recognized if he were blind and the smell of clean cut with the smell of old meat like alms, and it held a table with a long scratch in the shape of a letter that leaned, and it held two men doing the thing men do when they have convinced themselves they are above consequence: they were laughing at something that hadn\u2019t happened yet as if their laughter would cause its happening to be harmless. He didn\u2019t think hero; he thought oh for god\u2019s sake, because irritation is often the premier fuel for bravery.\n\nHe could have gone back for help and made the story polite. He could have taken a photograph and sent it to Aunt Beryl who would have known the name of the cousin of the man who owns the warehouse and can make permits evaporate with a phone call. He might yet do both. But he had a hook and a plumb and iron on his wrist and a habit of getting into trouble when the door is open just enough for a thin boy to slip through. He lifted the flap of air like a curtain and stepped in.\n\nIt smelled like mouthwash and lies. He did not let it tell him his nose was wrong. He saw the men turn as if they had heard a door, and perhaps they had, because honesty changes pressure. He put his hand out, palm open, and said the sentence that makes people reveal what they didn\u2019t plan to, I\u2019m so glad I caught you, and they moved like decent citizens who have been momentarily mistaken for villains, which is to say they tried to hide their hands without looking like they were hiding them. He laughed like a bully\u2019s friend and it put them at ease because men like this don\u2019t expect a boy who smells like drains to be in on a joke. He walked past them and took a bottle off the shelf and put it under his nose and pretended to admire it, and in doing so he put his iron wrist in front of his mouth so that whatever wanted to come in would have to argue with an ugly ring first.\n\nHe did not hurt them. He wanted to. He wanted to do the stupid good man thing of crushing hands with a broom handle and saying the word community as if it were a weapon. He didn\u2019t because his job is not to be king of bins with a cudgel; it is to make patterns that hold. He said instead in an unthreatening voice, this isn\u2019t going to work, and he let the hook do the work. He slid it under their pride and pulled, and the room tilted. The shelves did not fall; that would have been dramatic and unhelpful. The smell wavered. The ghost of the label on the bottle he held fluttered like a dollar bill in front of a fan, and the idea that they could do this unseen moved sideways, which is often all a lie needs to stop being able to stand.\n\nThey blustered. Of course they did. There are scripts for men like this, written into the city like chalk on old brick. They said the council, they said regulation, they said trial, they said necessary, they said early adopter, they said pilot. He repeated after them as if learning a language and pronounced their words wrong on purpose so that little laughter grew shoots out of his mouth and the room became unsafe for the straight, clean lines a brochure loves. He looked at the scratch on the table and let himself be arrogant one second because sometimes the only way to frustrate a man who leans is to lean harder and not fall, and he put his finger on the scar and said in a voice that should have been someone older\u2019s, you don\u2019t get to call it clean if we have to forget to love it.\n\nHe left. He took two bottles because he is a thief when theft is a grace and because evidence is a thing that has to be placed on a table in front of men with ties before they will move their heavy hands. He resealed the room without a verb and stood in the familiar wet throat of the city and wanted very much to sit down and cry because it would have been the simplest thing, and instead he texted Alan the word hooks and then the letter L and then a picture of his own iron because he needed to tell the truth to someone who would not make a theory out of it. Alan wrote back a single sentence that was beautiful because it came from a man whose love letter to bolts had never written him in before: I have a friend in Fire who hates solvents on religious grounds, and Kip laughed out loud in a place rain collects and then pressed his forehead to the wall and did nothing clever for thirty breaths because sometimes that is the only way to not be a story you cannot sustain.\n\nHe did bring Aunt Beryl the bottles and she did not kiss him or curse him; she put them in a cupboard that had a lock and then she put a bowl of stew in front of him and made him eat and then drink water before she told him that his face had gotten a little worse and that suited him. He went to the Anchor and she said nothing and then spoke a word that felt like a weight, and it helped, as weights do. He slept with the iron ring above his head like he was the kind of person who would put a child\u2019s teeth under a pillow and not be caught by mice, and he dreamt not of drains or solvents or rats in hi-vis but of a field somewhere not near the sea where worms can live without needing to be heroes and thought, as he woke, that he would need to take a train soon and talk to a farmer who had never thought of Geelong as a place where his work might matter.\n\nMorning came with bagpipes in his phone because the universe does not let jokes rest if they are serviceable, and it was the council man, bright as new rope, saying he had a room and chairs and more men than was strictly necessary and would Kip bring his buckets and his dirt. He put the plumb and the hook in his pocket and kissed Aunt Beryl on the cheek without getting hexed for it and put on his hat and went to be a version of himself that made people think they had had the idea first. Rot-Right made itself tall in him without being proud, which is the only way to be safe and useful at once, and the Anchor\u2019s pin scratched his cuff and told him to stand up straighter, and he thought, not without amusement, that the city had decided he would be a boy with a job whether he liked it or not and that he did, which was the real sorcery.\n\nThe room was air-conditioned into forgetfulness and carpeted into a kind of compliance that makes people behave as if their shoes matter when they don\u2019t. The men in ties were there, and two women who had the faces of people always put at the end of the table and never asked first, and a man with a Fire emblem on his chest who looked like the sort of person Alan would call when he needed solvents to regret their life choices. The bottles he had stolen sat on the table under a tea towel, domestic and obscene at once, and the council man\u2019s jaw was set in the way of a man who has decided which side he will be embarrassed on and it will not be the one that smells like lemon without lemons.\n\nHe did his dirt trick and made them smell memory instead of theory. He took the tea towel off the bottles and made the room flinch and didn\u2019t apologize for the rudeness of daylight on things that prefer shadow. He said Near when he meant policy and laughed when he needed them to breathe and held up the iron ring when he said the words don\u2019t go down alone. He watched the CHOICES woman in the corner with her pen unmoving and saw, for the first time, not a functionary but a person with a mother who had once told her to be brave and had meant something she had not done for a while. He made his case not as a cape-wearing city saviour but as a boy who would like to be held to account by people who can sign checks and wash up after themselves. The Fire man spoke about how solvents change the air and how the air is a thing you are not allowed to ruin because the rest of us own it, and the council man said a sentence that had the word moratorium in it and looked ashamed of the size of it, and a woman at the end of the table said what if we did something good that makes us look like we meant to all along and it felt like a prayer said correctly on the first try.\n\nWhen Kip left, he wasn\u2019t sure if he had won anything that could be put in an envelope, but he had the sense of something heavy having been placed on a side that had needed it. He walked out into a day that had the decency to be ordinary, and he felt his ring itch without malice and his plastic bracelet catch on the world in ways that kept him anchored, and he watched a gull steal a chip and decide not to eat it and bring it back to a small boy because the boy had clapped the gull for being clever and the gull had remembered that even thieves are susceptible to praise. He laughed and took that as a good omen because he likes to take as many of those as there are, and then he went to the bridge and sat with his feet on a grate and put his hand down to where Near lives and he hummed, a tune without words, a job without grandeur, a kindness that stinks and is therefore worth more than anything wrapped in cellophane.",

                              "content": "The first warm southerly of the year rose off Corio Bay with a taste of steel and lemon, teasing the water into fish-scale brightness and chasing whitecaps around the curve of Eastern Beach. On the pier, boys and grown men tried to pretend that the breeze was colder than it was. A chilly day, mate. Bracing. That old bluff. Heat makes people honest and they didn\u2019t want it yet.\n\nKip perched on the rail of Cunningham Pier and watched the wind invent itself. He was a small, wiry thing even by sprite standards, the color of eucalyptus bark and salt. The paint from the famous bollards didn\u2019t stain him anymore\u2014he had learned how to tilt his edges, how to let matter pass through him like a harmless ribbon\u2014but he still liked to rest his bare feet on their flat tops and imagine being tall and wooden and heavy, nailed into the earth.\n\n\u201cYou going to help or just sit there like a gull?\u201d Tansy called up from the deck of a fishing boat below. She had stuck a cigarette behind one ear and a pencil behind the other and kept grabbing the wrong one.\n\nKip turned upside down just because he could. He hung by the knees, hair falling in his eyes, and grinned at her. \u201cI\u2019m watching the physics.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe physics is a knot in my net. If you want to study that? Come down.\u201d\n\nHe dropped, a clean weightless fall that ended with one hand on the boat\u2019s rail and a soundless flick to bring his feet beneath him. The other sprite aboard, a glassy, jittering kid from the Barwon named Jet, widened her eyes until they flashed like a minnow. Humans never saw the drop. They saw a flicker, a man who had always been there.\n\n\u201cShow off,\u201d Tansy said. She was a rivergrass sprite who had chosen to grow into human shape most days because it got her better tips at the caf\u00e9 when she needed them, and because wearing boots and a hoodie kept her warm. Her voice had the rasp of winter frogs.\n\nKip lifted the net and breathed on it. Stray fish scales glowed like moons. Then he lifted again, pulling the threads apart in a peculiar pattern: up-over, under-twist, swap-two. All magic was pattern. All magic was naming the shape of the problem and then making a different one under its feet. His fingertips left a silver damp that sizzled where it touched sun.\n\nJet watched his hands. \u201cHow do you do that thing with the twist?\u201d she blurted. \u201cYou can see where the net is going to break, can\u2019t you? Before it happens.\u201d\n\n\u201cI listen,\u201d Kip said. He didn\u2019t move his mouth when he said it, didn\u2019t say it at all, really; he breathed the words into the woven threads and let the net repeat them. \u201cThey complain. They\u2019re old. They want to talk about all the fish they\u2019ve held.\u201d\n\nTansy rolled her eyes. \u201cThat is not listening. That is being strange. Hold your own end, Jet. There. You\u2014Kip\u2014where were you last night? You missed the meeting at the old woolstores. Aunt Beryl made a cake the size of a wheel, and when Aunt Beryl bakes cake you come, unless you want to be hexed so your ears ring for a month.\u201d\n\nKip made a face. \u201cThe woolstores make my teeth hurt.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything makes your teeth hurt,\u201d Tansy said. \u201cMoonlight on water, the taste of metal, somebody playing bagpipes three streets away.\u201d\n\n\u201cBagpipes should make everyone\u2019s teeth hurt,\u201d Kip said without heat. \u201cI was down by the river. Mending. Practicing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and your practicing,\u201d Tansy said, but there was fondness in it. \u201cOne day you\u2019re going to practice so hard you bend yourself into a knot and no one will be able to tell where your head is. Aunt Beryl says you should save that for when you\u2019re a hundred and have to tie your own beard over your nose.\u201d\n\nKip made a knot with two fingers and let it pour away like water.\n\nThe wind shifted. It came over the old Balmoral Hotel, over the brick warehouses that remembered sheep and grease. Over the silos. It came with a smell.\n\nKip\u2019s head snapped up. He didn\u2019t move otherwise, not even breath. The smell was not strong. That would come later, if it came at all. This was a ghost of a smell. The idea of it. Old meat wrapped in plastic and left behind a bin, that kind of look-away reek. A hospital drain on a warm day. Not quite there. Not yet.\n\nTansy kept talking. \u201cJet, put your finger there. No, further. He\u2014Kip\u2014there is a smell, isn\u2019t there. I can always tell when you\u2019re not listening.\u201d\n\nJet wrinkled her small pointed nose. \u201cUgh. That again? Cousin Birdie said she saw a stain under Prince\u2019s Bridge last night. A moving stain.\u201d\n\nKip swallowed a word that wasn\u2019t for public. \u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cDownriver,\u201d Jet said. \u201cNear the woollen mills. Like an oil slick. But in the air.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you told Aunt Beryl? The Anchor?\u201d\n\n\u201cTold everyone,\u201d Tansy said. \u201cEveryone tells everyone. That\u2019s the fun. I think it\u2019s made up. Probably a fox again. Or one of those homeless humans who eats out of bins and smells like it. Poor things. Don\u2019t go anxious at it.\u201d\n\nKip shook his head. Tansy liked explanations you could poke with a stick. This was not one of those. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t eat out of bins,\u201d he said, quiet now, too quiet. \u201cIt eats fear. It drinks what runs under the streets and it likes to chew on the bruise of a thing that used to be living.\u201d\n\nJet stared at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen it?\u201d\n\nKip thought of the night six months ago when he had set fog along the rocks in a pattern too complicated even for him to like. He had called for something with long fingers and it had come, laughing, because he had made a door and left it open. The taste in the air after had been like a dead bird in summer. He had woken up at Eastern Park with mud in his hair and no blood in his left hand; it drifted for hours, as if it had forgotten how to be flesh.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen its shadow,\u201d he said. \u201cKeep mending. Please.\u201d\n\nTansy shut her mouth on a dozen questions. She finished the net while Kip held and Jet fussed and the men talked footy behind them, arguing about the Cats with the same old comfortable rumbles. The smell faded. The wind went back to lemon and steel.\n\nLater, when the sun had leaned itself onto the water and started stretching, Kip walked the promenade in a pair of borrowed boots. He liked shoes when he wanted to feel the ground in a dull way. Socks were harder. Socks made him irritable. The bollards watched him go past; their painted eyes didn\u2019t move, but he felt the tacky hum of old attention.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re sniffing for it,\u201d said a dry voice, \u201cyou won\u2019t smell it with ocean on your lip.\u201d\n\nKip stopped and turned toward a woman sitting on a bench, her hair like iron filings and her skin full of lines, every one of them earned. Humans would have said she was a woman in her seventies with a glint like broken glass. Sprites saw the keels of ships carved into her shoulders, an anchor at the base of her throat like a brand, the iron taste of ballast and the cotton-lanolin stink of wool half a century old. The Anchor did not bother to hide what she was. She never had.\n\n\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d Kip said. He stood straight, because you did that for her. You didn\u2019t slouch when you were pointed at by the history of the bay.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t good afternoon me,\u201d she said, but she smiled. \u201cYou missed cake.\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard,\u201d he said, because he had. Aunt Beryl had made a cake, and the Anchor had probably sat with her big kind hands behind her big cold eyes and eaten twice her share for politeness, then gone down to the water and spat in it for balance. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been practicing,\u201d the Anchor said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been practicing where you shouldn\u2019t. Don\u2019t argue. The river told me. It tells me everything. It is indiscreet.\u201d\n\nKip stared at his boots. The leather had softened around his toes. He wrinkled them, then stilled when the Anchor raised an eyebrow.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s here again,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re calling it Rankin this time, I think. They like to make names. It makes the shapeless feel like you can put it in a bottle and label it. Fools.\u201d\n\nKip repeated the name silently. Rankin. The word tasted of rusted nails and wet wool. A local name for a not-local thing. \u201cYou\u2019ve fought it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the Anchor said. She stretched, the bench creaking under her. \u201cWe pushed the last one out when they cleaned the drains for the Commonwealth Games. The engineers did it and didn\u2019t even know they had. Now look. Twenty years of plastic, and lazy rain, and men who pour old fat down their sinks. Now look. The city hums with its kind of happiness. Of course it came. Of course. Moss grows in shade. Rot goes where you leave it a corner. Sprite, don\u2019t go alone.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. He wanted to say hope is moss too. It grows if you leave it a corner. Silly.\n\n\u201cThere are other smart ones,\u201d she said. \u201cBeryl. That boy who listens to screws and thinks he\u2019s old. The stone aunties under the You Yangs. They\u2019ll help. And you. You are too clever for your own bones. Don\u2019t let that be the death of you.\u201d\n\nKip gave a lopsided smile. \u201cI can be very stupid if that helps.\u201d\n\nThe Anchor rapped her knuckles on the bench; the sound was like a hammer on a hull. \u201cIt won\u2019t. Go see the bath at Eastern Beach. They say the water curdled when a child waded this morning. They say the child cried and vomited and her father called CHOICES and then forget what he saw. It can do that. It can make your brain go cloudlike. Remember your shape. Keep a thread to your own elbow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always keep a thread,\u201d he said, and felt in his pocket for the loop of braided seagrass he had kept since he was a child, when Aunt Beryl braided everything and he collected the ends. He kept a thread to his own elbow. He hummed to himself because he always did, and the tune made itself from wave and gull and joke.\n\n\u201cSomething has been humming you back lately,\u201d the Anchor said, not unkindly. \u201cGo on.\u201d\n\nHe went.\n\nIt is a city that leaves things lying around for stories to trip over. Wrecks in the bay. Brick walls half falling down, graffiti that had intelligence and then didn\u2019t. There were still rabbits in gardens. Sun fell through the lattice at the pavilion and made a charade of shadows. People ate chips too fast because of the seagulls and then fed the gulls when they thought nobody was watching. Human ritual.\n\nThe gentle steps down into the sea bath were slick with a translucent green that wasn\u2019t quite seaweed and wasn\u2019t really not. Kip put his bare feet down, one after the other, held the rail, went slow. He could walk on water. That wasn\u2019t the point. There were better respects than that.\n\nUna, the human lifeguard with forearms like a history lesson and tattoos of octopuses on both calves, lifted a hand when she recognized him. She did not think he was human. She didn\u2019t think about what he was. She thought about his help when the boy went under last summer and floated back up with his mouth full of congratulations. She thought about that and decided the rest could be sorted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not right,\u201d she said, just like that. \u201cIt feels like milk that went off three hot days ago and someone keeps pushing it through the tap out there and hoping we don\u2019t notice.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not milk,\u201d Kip said. He dipped his fingers into the bath, or rather let the bath dip itself into him. \u201cIt wants you to think it\u2019s that. It wants your nose to be ordinary.\u201d\n\nUna rubbed her forearms, then stopped, annoyed at herself for being unsettled. \u201cWe had three old ducks complain they could taste beef when they swam. That\u2019s not a thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is someone\u2019s thing,\u201d Kip said absently. He had the shape of it, now. He could taste the thin membranes between what the water remembered and what the water had to do. The bath remembered babies who had learned to float here, men who had taught themselves to breathe that way again, women who had come with the softest smiles and no one who would not let them swim in the ocean and had sunk and risen, sunk and risen, slowly, on a rope.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing? Is that safe?\u201d Una asked.\n\n\u201cNothing is safe,\u201d Kip said. \u201cListen with me.\u201d\n\nUna snorted. \u201cIt\u2019s your head. Try not to blow up.\u201d\n\nHe closed his eyes and put both hands on the surface, pressing down until the skin of the water curved and held him like a drum. The song he used was old and silly\u2014when Aunt Beryl taught him it, she had used it to make the washing up go faster\u2014but it had a good beat and a sideways joke in it that slid under sorrow and lifted it up. He hummed, and the bath shivered, and his breath came back with a taste like pennies.\n\nSomething pushed into him, friendly as a cat, and something else tugged at his hair with childish cruelty. He let it. A kite tried to fly out of his shoulder blade and he anchored it with a thought. The smell rose with the first bright ring of song, bright and then not. It should have dissipated in the wind, should have run out into the bay and gone thin. But a curl of it stuck low over the water, clinging.\n\nHe had a moment\u2019s double vision: the bath and his breath and the rail and also a black tube that carried night, not water. The rail became a rib, the steps became teeth, Una turned her head and the tattoo on her calf unspooled into label, expense, glue.\n\nHe blinked and the weirdness snapped back into its box. He knew that box. It was not supposed to open on its own.\n\n\u201cIt likes to hide in corners,\u201d he said, and his voice wasn\u2019t quite as even as he hoped. He pulled his hands up and water came with them for an extra heartbeat, clinging like a skin that didn\u2019t want to be left behind. He made a little circle in the air with his finger and the piece that stuck broke down, fell in a rush.\n\nUna watched the wet trickle down into the bath. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d he said, which was the oldest lie in any language. \u201cWhere did the child get sick?\u201d\n\nUna pointed. He walked that way, ankle deep, turned three times in a row, once slowly, and sang a different kind of nothing. Luck is not a joke but you can tell it as one. The smell, such as it had been, cast up again, thin as paper. He touched it with one careful knuckle.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you want to be a story that stops here or keeps going?\u201d\n\nA bump, childish-emphatic. Keeps. Goes.\n\nHe tried a trick Aunt Beryl hated. He made himself small inside his own head, very small, a single curled-finger sized thing, and sent that thing out through his hand into the smell. It slid under him with ease. It felt like grease with sand in it. It felt like chewing for too long. For an instant he knew the joy of rot, the relief it carried: end of responsibility, end of shape, end of needing to hold anything together. He wanted it. A little.\n\nHe cut the wanting off with a hard sharp thought, the kind that had saved him, more than once, from being a puddle of someone else\u2019s idea. He withdrew; the bit of him that had gone out came back with salt all over it that hadn\u2019t been there, and he had to sneeze. Seven times.\n\nUna, who had seen stranger things, pretended not to be alarmed. \u201cBless you. Stop there before the city runs out of polite.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone,\u201d he said, although they both knew that was bravado. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t like to be seen. It will leave when you look.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see it?\u201d Una asked.\n\n\u201cI see the space it likes,\u201d Kip said. \u201cI\u2019ll sweep out the corners. You can help by telling everyone it\u2019s nothing. It feeds on fear. It wants us all a little tired.\u201d\n\nUna narrowed her eyes. \u201cPeople always want me to tell other people things. The trouble with everyone is everyone else.\u201d\n\nHe laughed, and the bath let him laugh, and for a minute there were no black tubes in the back of his eyes.\n\nLater, though, back at the breakwater, the smell came again. Stronger. Kip tried to ignore it, tried to be ordinary, to sit on the rocks and watch the ferries and let his mind simple itself. The You Yangs to the west sat like sleeping animals. The bay was very blue. It was late enough that the gulls had given up their aggressive shift and were starting to beg instead.\n\nThe wind told a secret: drains. He stood. His boots were waiting on one rock. He left them. He walked past the carousel and past the fish and chip shops, past the small night things that only moved when no one was looking, past a teenager practicing skateboard tricks on the smooth concrete and swearing Monday-words every time he missed. The stormwater grates along the road all had eyes. He knew their names if he wanted to. He had named some of them as a boy: Gerald, Beige, Ow.\n\nUnder the bridge the air tasted like time hadn\u2019t noticed humans had invented plastic. He ducked without needing to, slid sideways through a space the size of a letter slot, and walked on into the kind of dark that had weight.\n\nHe hadn\u2019t told anyone. He never told anyone when he did this. He would tell them after he had done it; he could make it into a story then and control its edges. Kip walked to the slow music of his own bones and made small lights from the edges of his fingers. The lights called moths that weren\u2019t moths, made of dust and old sentences. He loved them. He stepped lightly. Once he slipped and his toe went into something that dissolved under it. He pulled his foot back and felt memory try to pull him along. He kept his thread at his elbow. He touched the loop of braided seagrass in his pocket and spoke a nonsense to it: stay. stay. stay with me. don\u2019t do that thing. stay.\n\nHe heard the smell before he felt it. No, wrong way round. He smelled sound. He tasted a chord that wasn\u2019t music and that bent the hair on his arms backwards so that each hair shouted. There was a voice in it and he recognized the shape of that voice. He froze, not because fear but because recognition, and he wished he could walk backwards in time six breaths and go back to when he didn\u2019t know a thing he was about to know.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he asked, because he was conventional in danger.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d said the voice, and it came from everywhere and nowhere, and it was not a whisper and not a shout. It sounded as if a mouth were too full and trying anyway. The smell flared, a bright slick heavy with a sweetness that was not a flavor and not a promise.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very clever,\u201d Kip said, to keep it light. \u201cWe\u2019re all there for ourselves. Philosophically. You sound like a book trying to be heard over traffic.\u201d\n\nSomething moved just at the edge of his light and then moved again closer. There was nothing to look at, and then there was too much. Kip\u2019s light showed the glitter of a wrapper, the curve of an old bottle, a thread of hair that might have belonged to a person or to a rope, and underneath it all a deepen in the air as if it were sagging under a weight you couldn\u2019t see. He did not, would not, focus his eyes on the place where it seemed thickest. He\u2019d learned that the hard way with mirror-water. He looked aside.\n\n\u201cKip,\u201d said the voice. It said his name. It said his name as if it had invented it.\n\nHe made his own voice practical because he had to. \u201cDid you make a child sick this morning?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly a little,\u201d said the voice. \u201cOnly enough to make them remember that bodies are bodies and that sometimes they fail. Only enough to teach this day to be long. A small lesson. There are worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are worse,\u201d he echoed. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I was hungry. I woke hungry,\u201d said the voice, as if that were the end of it. It sounded almost affronted that hunger wasn\u2019t sufficient explanation: the complaint of a winter cat.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t eat children,\u201d Kip said, gentle, slow. \u201cDon\u2019t eat ordinary days. Eat\u2026 the bad ends of things.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour days are ordinary?\u201d the voice said, and laughed. The smell went sharper, like the moment before meat goes from safe to risky. \u201cHow proud. How wrong. Ordinary is a word for not-me. I am ordinary. Heaps of me in bins. Heaps of me in drains. Heaps of me in all the boats you make and use until you leave them to rot then pretend they were something else first.\u201d\n\nKip felt his hands get cold. \u201cWho named you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d said the voice. \u201cYou smelled me and you hung a word on me, you thought you were a king with a label-maker. You named me Rankin because you wanted to make me as small as a human man who came and went. Names are for hope. So be hopeful. Name me again.\u201d\n\nThe lights on his fingertips guttered and surged. He could put out more light. He could blast this tunnel full of brightness so hard it ached. He could, but it would just show him the all of what he wasn\u2019t ready for, and anyway his kind of magic was not throwing. His kind was making. He took his hand off the pocket with the seagrass loop and counted the bones in his left foot instead, toe to ankle, because that was a map of being alive. He listened. The voice came from everywhere because the voice was inside as well as out.\n\nHe had heard his voice like this once before and not known it. He had taken something home that night it rained blood-brown mud from the paddocks. It had followed his breath in and had sat under his ribs and he had sung to it because he sang to everything. He had fed it his own tidy anger at careless humans and it had liked the taste so much it had grown teeth, slowly, gently. He had woke with grit on his tongue and thought it was dreams.\n\n\u201cChild,\u201d said the voice, no longer speaking as the drain. \u201cDummy. Friend. You have been eating me in middle-of-the-night spoonfuls for a season. And now you come here and talk like you\u2019re a river.\u201d\n\nKip bit the inside of his mouth and tasted iron. \u201cSo we know each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said the voice, and then it laughed in a different cadence\u2014a sound he had made when Tansy told a rude joke about a kitchen mop and a nun\u2014and the world slid five degrees sideways. He had a flash of how he must look from outside: a small figure in a black tunnel with his own green-white light haloing his fingers and eyes. He had a flash of his face reflected in black water. He also had a flash of not being a he. Of being the smell itself, a rope of air, a burn of acid, a surprised joy. He backed up one step and his heel bumped a bottle; the noise of it clacking along the tunnel was petty and bright and saved him.\n\n\u201cStop that,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t invite you in.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou made me,\u201d said the voice, tender like a knife. \u201cYou\u2019re the clever little moss that thinks moss has no enemies. Half your tricks are rot turned sideways. You decay what doesn\u2019t do and call it a charm. You ferment water to get rain. You\u2019re not a leaf-and-sun guy, Kip. You\u2019re a compost heap with a grin, and I love you for it. Come closer. Let\u2019s be the same again. It was so cold alone.\u201d\n\nHe heard the truth of it. He heard his own truth curved. He knew what he had done, in the smallest, and he had only himself to blame. He closed his eyes because that let him see better. He imagined his cells, all of them, sweetly sprung like kelp when a current lifts it. He let the current be the kind that warmed, not the cold that took fingers. He said the names of his own parts to himself: spleen, lung, brainstem, metatarsal. He said the name of his mother, who had been a blue ghost in the reeds, and his father, who had not been anything like human and had still come with soft gifts. He said the name of Aunt Beryl. Of Tansy. Of the Anchor and her hands that had been warm on his head when he was feverish once in summer. He said the name of stone. The You Yangs. He said Geelong like an oath and like a lullaby and like a rude word.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me your names,\u201d said the voice, impatient now. \u201cI know them. I own half of them. I wore them when you slept. You don\u2019t remember? Look at your fingers, smart boy.\u201d\n\nHe did. In his light, his fingers were clean. Under the nail of his left thumb there was a blackness as if he had caught dirt that wouldn\u2019t wash out. He scraped it with a tooth. The taste was old fat. He gagged and thought about laughing too hard to hide it. He was alone with a shape of himself and wanted to be the person who could sit down and talk.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t fair,\u201d he said, which was ridiculous. Nothing was fair. That had never stopped anyone.\n\n\u201cFair would be nothing eating anything,\u201d said the voice. \u201cFair would be the ocean taking all at once. Fair is a game they teach in school so everyone can lose the same. Keep your story straight, bright thing. This is hunger and laziness, and you built it into a decent trick. It carried you when you couldn\u2019t sleep. It smelled what you couldn\u2019t. It made itself,\u201d\u2014a pause, almost proud\u2014\u201cme. I am pretty.\u201d\n\nKip made his light very small. He made it a dot. He held it in his left hand, just above the heart line. He thought of the loop of seagrass again and did not take it out.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he asked finally. \u201cBeyond food.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be named,\u201d said the voice, and the smell softened, grew florals around edges he hadn\u2019t expected. \u201cTo be given a place. A purpose. I don\u2019t want to be the bin behind the chip shop, loved only by gulls. I want to be the hospital drain that took your spit and let you live. I want to be the worm at the heart of a plum but in a poem. I want to be your mouth when you say ugly and mean useful instead.\u201d\n\nHe had not been expecting that. He had been expecting it to ask for a little city of its own where it could make people faint in the daylight. He had been expecting it to ask him to leave, or to join, but not like this. He rubbed his thumb and forefinger together until his nails clicked. His chest hurt. He wanted to sleep. He wanted to walk to Tansy and put his head on her shoulder and tell her everything, and also to never have anyone say poor Kip with their eyes.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have my hands,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI have one thumbnail already,\u201d said the voice, amused. \u201cKeep the rest. I want a name that isn\u2019t a joke. I want not to be hungry. I want the luxury of a fast. Make me a job.\u201d\n\nKip started to laugh because the demand was so\u2026 domestic. A job. He had time, then, to craft what was needed. He shaped a thought as if he were making rope. \u201cNot drains. Not people. Compost, you said that word. Can you turn what would stink into what will feed? Can you make a garden out of waste? Can you be municipal in your horror?\u201d\n\nThe smell paused, considered. The tunnel breathed twice. Water dripped from somewhere like a metronome. In the space between one drop and another, a small shape bumped his ankle and he looked down and saw a rat, clean as rain, watching him as if she had brought her children here for a lecture and wanted to see if the pictures would be funny.\n\n\u201cI can,\u201d said the voice. \u201cI can be municipal.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Kip said. He lifted his hand. He did take the seagrass loop out then, and wound it twice round his wrist. \u201cRankin, I name you Rot-Right. I name you Curdle-Towards, Sour-With-Purpose. I name you Worm\u2019s-Hand and Bin-King and Lord of the Compost Heap, which is no insult in my bed. I name you Friend of Kitchens. I name you Hospital-Drain-Clean. I name you Runner of Rivulettes that feed trees. I name you Protector of Children\u2019s Stomachs, and that\u2019s the big one. You don\u2019t get to play the old joke at the shallow end anymore. Do you hear me?\u201d\n\nIt did. He knew it did because the smell changed again, where it curled around his tongue. It shifted from wanting everything to wanting one thing well. It smelled like a good garden on a hot day in January when tomatoes burst and someone laughs and says get a bowl, quick.\n\nBut he was not a fool. He did not think he had solved everything with a set of pretty names and a ridiculous title. He had set a pattern, that was all. Patterns help. Sometimes the tide is enough to keep them steady. Sometimes a storm comes. He would need help. He should have asked for it already. He would. He would.\n\n\u201cDo you belong to me,\u201d the voice said, sly now, trying the old trick of flipping the edge.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Kip said. \u201cWe belong to the same city. I will tell Aunt Beryl. I will tell the Anchor. We will set you to work. We will feed you, but not like that.\u201d\n\nIt shivered. He heard the start of a sulk and, underneath it, what might have been relief. Something inside him relaxed, as if an inn had put its shutters up in a good storm and lit the fire and put out blankets. He almost fell down right there and slept on the wet. He did not.\n\nHe turned around and began to walk back towards the light, slow enough to not be a prey animal. He went sideways through the letter-slot gap, stood under the bridge in the half-heart light, and felt the air again as if he had forgotten what it was. The night smelled like river and tea from a man\u2019s thermos and car exhaust and fried potato. He breathed all of it and smiled at all of it and was too tired to do anything with any of it.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d said a small voice near his ankle, the rat perhaps, or a child, or a piece of broken bottle that had a talent. \u201cYou forgot your shoe.\u201d\n\nHe looked down. He had not been wearing shoes.\n\nHe went to the caf\u00e9 where Tansy worked the evening shift. She made him hot chocolate with chili and a cinnamon stick, because she was an artist. Jet came in later with hair that had been washed too fast and jam on her sleeve. Aunt Beryl called three times and left three progressively more threatening messages about cake.\n\n\u201cYou look like you got in a fight with a mop,\u201d Tansy said softly when the caf\u00e9 was empty enough for honest talk. \u201cAnd lost.\u201d\n\n\u201cI talked to it,\u201d Kip said, setting his cup down so gently he wanted to laugh at himself. He had never been unsteady with a cup. He was unsteady now. \u201cI named it a job.\u201d\n\nTansy put her face in her hands and then took it out and looked as if she wished her hands had some other, larger use. \u201cYou what.\u201d\n\n\u201cI made a compost king,\u201d he said. He wanted to say, I made a thing of myself that hungers and hates. He wanted to say, I recognized my own tongue in the tunnel. He didn\u2019t. You can\u2019t say everything at once. The body will not let.\n\n\u201cIs that wise?\u201d Jet asked from behind a muffin. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m only eleven, but if somebody named me a job I didn\u2019t want I\u2019d chew their hat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked it,\u201d Kip said. \u201cIt wanted a place. I said yes to the part of it that might be useful. I said no to the part that eats kids. I will need help with the no. The Anchor warned me. I didn\u2019t listen fast enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone says no to kids,\u201d Tansy said, eyes far away. \u201cUntil they don\u2019t. Be careful.\u201d\n\nHe nodded and finished his chocolate and ate the cinnamon stick because it was better that way, and he liked how wrong it felt. He watched the door swing open and shut and tried not to think of the word he had avoided ever since the tunnel. It sits sideways on the tongue, the idea that the worst thing outside might be the shape of you. He was not there yet. He knew and did not know and hung the knowledge like washing on a line, where it could lift in wind and look like something else until you pulled it down and wore it.\n\nHe slept that night in a hollow under a bank of tea-tree near Rippleside. He dreams in odd loops and sometimes they catch him like a hook. Tonight his dreams went like this: a small boy holds a dead starfish and weeps and the smell of it makes him laugh; a girl dives and stays down and stays down and he pulls her up with long slow hands that are not his and he covers her mouth with rot and she lives; Aunt Beryl stirs a pot that is full of worms and sings under her breath, off-key; the Anchor takes the sea in her fist and squeezes it to jelly; Tansy sits at his left shoulder and says, \u201cYou.\u201d He woke three times, thirsty, and did not drink. The river gossiped all night.\n\nMorning did not make things simple. He thought it might. It looked as if it might. The light over the You Yangs was pale and deliberate. Early runners ran with their early runner faces; dogs did silly dog things and then looked serious about it. He let the water of the bay touch his ankles and pretended it was a consecration.\n\nHe went to Aunt Beryl with a basket of figs he had stolen off a fence and laid them on her table, which was a door on trestles. She looked at his face, not the figs, and said, \u201cOh, my love,\u201d the way an adult says oh when a child has found out that a magic trick was done with a mirror.\n\n\u201cYou made cake,\u201d he said. It seemed the right language.\n\nShe cut him a slice so big it made his wrists ache to hold the plate. \u201cYou made a friend,\u201d she said. \u201cOr you named your shadow. It\u2019s the same. Don\u2019t look at me. Eat. We\u2019ll unpick it. It\u2019s what we do. We\u2019ll unpick and pick again.\u201d\n\nHe did not mean to cry. He did mean to wash his hands before he touched anyone. Aunt Beryl took his hands and held them in her big soft bread-maker\u2019s hands and sniffed his thumb and said, \u201cAh. I wondered where my missing fat bowl went,\u201d and laughed, big and rude, and he laughed too and the laugh was the best kind, the one that comes with clean air. Afterwards she wrapped his thumb in a sprig of rosemary and told him to go to the Anchor and confess properly, and then to go down to the gardens by the university and see if the kind old bloke there in the broad-brim hat\u2014the one who actually listened to earth\u2014would want help composting. \u201cFeed your pet,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t starve it. That will only make it eat you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not a pet,\u201d he said, automatically, gently stubborn.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she agreed. \u201cIt isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a pocket in your jacket that you forgot was there. It will hold whatever you put into it until one day you put your hand in and a mouse jumps out and runs up your sleeve. Mind you don\u2019t throw the jacket into a fire with it on. That is to say: don\u2019t panic. The city makes more of this than you do.\u201d She kissed his head and shoved cake at him and he went back out into the bright day feeling stained and again.\n\nAt the garden, the old man with the broad-brim hat turned out to be a woman with severe glasses and a bright pink shirt that said For The Love Of Worms. She had badges on her hat: save our soils; kiss me I\u2019m carbon. He loved her immediately.\n\n\u201cI need a job for a smell,\u201d he said, which is not how normal people begin conversations, and she blinked and said, \u201cMe too, mate,\u201d and then laughed when he looked startled and explained about the new worm farm they were trying to keep from being raided by rats. He said he knew a rat who respected fences. She made him tea and told him to hold the bucket while she turned the pile and he held it and breathed and let what needed to feed feed.\n\nIt was early yet. There were weeks in it. Months. Years, perhaps. He was a patient person when he remembered to be. He was also a ferocious one when he forgot. The city went on. The bay breathed. Someone lit a fire in a backyard and leaned back smug and then panicked when the wind caught it, and somewhere further down the coast the skeletons of horses that had not outrun flame once upon a time reminded the grass how to be kind.\n\nIn the afternoon he went back to the drains with a string bag full of eggshells and coffee grounds and orange peels and left them like offerings in corners that wanted magic. He did it with the careful loving pettiness of grudge work. He did not say a word. He hummed. The smell came and went like a neighbor in a yard, arms folded on the fence.\n\nHe was not at the caf\u00e9 that evening. He was in a place he did not remember going to, a room with low ceilings and a carpet like teeth, and a man with a suit who said something about community engagement. Kip stared at his own reflection in a framed certificate and the glass swam until all he saw was the black shine of a drain, and then he saw his own mouth open and say, clear as day, \u201cWe are going to take what is rotting and fix it,\u201d and for an instant he did not know whether his voice had said it as him or as the thing inside that was him but other. The men in suits nodded as if he had made sense. Maybe he had. For once.\n\nHe went home with flyers about waste management and the knowledge that he had signed up for an open day in three weeks where he had promised to do a demonstration. He dreamt a wheelbarrow full of rinds. He woke laughing.\n\nThe smell came again, of course. It came size-shift, mood-shift, hunger-shift. It came with music from a party two streets over and it came with the sweat of a man who ran. He was getting used to it. He was getting not used to it. Both.\n\nHe heard a child say to her mother, that looks like a fairy, and the mother say don\u2019t be ridiculous and then apologize to the child when the sky changed color for no reason; he did not have anything to do with it. He did and he didn\u2019t.\n\nIt kept saying his name. Only sometimes. Only when it mattered. Always in that half-laugh. He was a clever boy. He was a mess. He was Geelong\u2019s oddest son, and he could feel the old city under the new city, the bones under the skin, the drains under the roads, the old docks under the new bars. He belonged to that. He always had. He had never been only one name. He carried the stink and the shine.\n\nHe would tell the Anchor the true version. He would. He would tell her he had made a shadow and made it a job and sat in the dark and spoke to himself in two voices and been afraid and loved how good he was at it. He would tell her he had never wanted to be ordinary. He would ask if she could show him how to tie his own beard over his nose when he was a hundred. He would ask to be told no, properly, often.\n\nHe walked the bay. He watched the wind build itself again out of nothing. He held his breath. He let it go. He grinned at a gull who was too smart for god and was in the middle of distracting a dog from a hot chip. He wanted to learn that trick. He wanted to be the dog. He wanted to be everything.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not done,\u201d the smell said, very polite, at his shoulder. \u201cWe are not done.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Kip said. \u201cGood. Help me wash.\u201d He stepped into the bath at Eastern Beach again and this time the water held him like an auntie and let him sink a little and then a little more until he could hear the voices of the tiles. He found the place where the child had swayed and got sick and he put his hands on it like a benediction and said to no one and to everyone and to himself, \u201cWe don\u2019t eat that. We step around that. There are rules.\u201d\n\nHe felt the agreement like rain. He felt disagreement like someone tearing a paper in another room. When he came up for air, Una tossed him a towel and said, \u201cWe\u2019re getting a sign made that says no vomit,\u201d and he said, \u201cMake it in Comic Sans if you want people to laugh,\u201d and she said, \u201cYou are very specific,\u201d and he said, \u201cIt\u2019s the job,\u201d and that was that.\n\nAt dusk, Aunt Beryl called again and said bring your thumbs to me and he did, and she trimmed his nails with scissors that had belonged to her mother and sang while she did it and then tucked the clippings into a jar and said, \u201cFor later,\u201d and when he looked as if he had a question, she added, \u201cNo, I won\u2019t tell you when. Don\u2019t go making it a day. Let it surprise you.\u201d\n\nHe walked home through a city that knew him by three names. He let it. He had room under his ribs for one more laugh. He had room for a smell and a song. He had room for the worst sort of kindness, the kind that fixes, that takes away what you thought was going to make you special and replaces it with a job. He had always wanted a job. He had wanted magic. He had both.\n\nHe slept and did not dream of drains.\n\nFor one night. Only one.",

He stretched until his ribs clicked into one another in a satisfying way and lay still for one selfish minute, long enough to listen to the small things: water pushing its little shoulders against shore, wind rehearsing on a blade of grass, a beetle attempting a complicated maneuver on a twig and swearing in beetle. Then he got up and did the dull human business of wearing boots and pulling on a jacket as armor against attention, and went to find the woman who kept the bay stuck to its edges.\n\nThe Anchor met him two benches along from yesterday as if she had not moved in the dark, as if daylight merely lit the figure she always was. She had knitting today, a brutal-looking garment the color of stormwater with little knots in it like barnacles and needles that gleamed when they caught the sun. Humans looked at her and saw their grandmother or a threat, depending on how they had behaved with boats. Sprites saw a shipwright\u2019s patience, a ledger\u2019s sin-eater, and an iron ring where a headland might be. When Kip stopped, she did not make him speak at once; she looked at his hands, at the line of his mouth, at the bit of rosemary Aunt Beryl had tied on with string and not removed, and she made a thoughtful sound that could have meant anything from poor boy to well, of course.\n\n\u201cI have been an idiot,\u201d he said without preface, because sometimes penance is not a ceremony but a hand out with something that stings on it. He told her about the tunnel in a clean run, words like stones dropped into a bucket. He did not embroider and he did not try to make himself bigger where he had been small. He did not hide that part where he had laughed at rot and felt it as a kindness. He told her the names he had given it and the names it had given itself, and when he said Rot-Right her mouth twitched as if she had caught a fish by its lip and was not yet sure whether to keep it.\n\n\u201cYou set it to a wheel,\u201d she said, and the knitting needles went click, click like a bell buoy in a chop. \u201cYou gave it a spoke to follow and something to push against. That is not nothing. That is not always the wrong way. Tell me what you did to the child.\u201d\n\n\u201cI gave it rules,\u201d he said, and then he winced at his own pronoun and corrected it because the Anchor had a low tolerance for sloppy thinking. \u201cI gave them rules. I said, no children. It was not a bargain. I didn\u2019t let it be a bargain. It was a naming. I said it out loud to the bath and to the tiles and to Una\u2019s tattoo.\u201d\n\nThe Anchor nodded once, a slow weighty thing. \u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cEnough? No. A start? Yes. But. You did it alone. You went below alone, and you think very well of your own ability to keep a thread to your elbow, but threads snap on concrete with a little grit. I am going to say a word to you like a teacher with a ruler. Counterweight. You are all air and sideways with a weight in your pocket you think is a stone. It is not. It is a jelly. We will put a stone on the other side.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like stones,\u201d he said mildly, because even now he wanted to make it less sharp. \u201cWhat kind?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo kinds,\u201d she said, and put the knitting down and looked at him without any humor for a compact span of time. \u201cOne you wear. One you ask for. You will wear a ring of iron. Not a pretty thing. Not a story thing. A piece of rail cut with a hacksaw and bent cold. It will make your wrist itch and make people look at you and not see what you want them to see. It will slow the bit of you that runs ahead and opens doors. You will not take it off except to wash your skin under it every third day. If you take it off without telling me why, I will find you and make sure you remember that sometimes keels are people. The other weight is company. You do not go under alone again. You take Tansy or Beryl or the screw-listening boy or Alan who never spells his name the same twice or that glass shimmer of a child, Jet. You take them not to be brave but to be seen. Your kind disappears too easily when it suits you, and I am very, very old and very tired of pulling you back out by your ankle.\u201d\n\nKip let himself feel the chastening without hiding from it. It made his skin burn in a useful way. He had always thought he preferred to be told no by someone who loved him and could hit hard without missing. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, because there weren\u2019t other words of value. \u201cI\u2019ll wear your ugly ring. I\u2019ll bring a friend. Two friends if I can bribe them with cake.\u201d\n\n\u201cCake is currency,\u201d the Anchor agreed gravely, and then she smiled, a sudden flash of harbor-light. \u201cI say ugly because I am jealous. I never had a pretty ring. The bay does that to your taste. Go down to the rails at North Wharf and ask Old Trevor to cut you a bit. He\u2019ll make a joke about prison. Let him. He was never in a prison that wasn\u2019t a marriage. Also\u2014\u201d she paused to count stitches, and the interval broke the air neatly into before advice and after advice\u2014 \u201cdon\u2019t name anything municipal without checking whether City has already named it. They will sue you. They will come with clipboards and ask if you have permission to call a thing that. If you put a hat on a rat and call it Chair, they will take minutes.\u201d\n\nHe snorted and felt the weight in his chest lighten imperceptibly. \u201cI have a meeting in three weeks,\u201d he confessed, remembering the carpet like teeth and the phrase community engagement spoken as if it might be a talisman. \u201cI promised to make a presentation. About compost. For worms.\u201d\n\nHer look softened. \u201cOh, my heart,\u201d she said in gentle mockery. \u201cYou stumble into civilian life like a swan into a hardware store. It will be fine. Bring samples. Make old men hold handfuls of good dirt. Bring pictures of children who have green things for lunch because you don\u2019t feed the drains. Make a joke and make it again. People believe what they laugh at twice.\u201d\n\nHe nodded and then, because he had held the darkest part back until he had done the tidy parts, he said, \u201cAnd it said my name like I say my name. It laughed my laugh in a place where you shouldn\u2019t hear that sort of thing. It wants a job and it wants a home. I am both and I am not. I wanted to be kind and clever and instead I feel like I have adopted a nephew I once killed by accident and then brought back as a houseplant.\u201d\n\nThe Anchor didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cYou are not unique,\u201d she said. \u201cDo not be insulted. Everyone reptiles their shadow at least once if they live long. You have done it in time. The worst are the ones who wait and wait and then discover that the shadow is a city block wide and already married with children. Don\u2019t be frightened of being ordinary in this. You are very good at dressing work in outrageous clothes so that you feel special doing it. That will serve you now. Outrageous clothes are a protection for shy jobs. Dress your Rot as a king of bins until he believes he is a uniform. And when fear comes up at you and wants to be eaten, send it to me. I like my breakfast complicated.\u201d\n\nIt was ridiculous to be steady after that. It was also exactly what he was. He let himself be ordinary in the best way, which was to sit with his elders and not argue with their sense. He sat long enough to feel his muscles become the bench\u2019s muscles, long enough for the bay to shift color twice, and when he got up to go she stuck a pin in his jacket like an aunt at a christening. It was a thin strip of steel twisted into the shape of nothing in particular. Humans would say modernist. Sprites felt the relief of a promise when they looked at it, a dinghy tied with a knot that had seen weather. \u201cFor your cuff when you get silly,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is, always.\u201d\n\nHe went north for the iron. North Wharf was a place that hid under its own stories; the tang of rust had become a perfume there, and the old men who stood with their hands in their pockets watching the gulls had faces like the front pages of newspapers left to bleach on dashboards. Old Trevor had eyebrows like nesting materials and salt tattoos that no sailor would ever have admitted to liking. He did not ask why Kip wanted iron; he did not ask anything except whether Kip had brought him something he could tell his wife about to explain the favor. Kip, prepared by a lifetime in this city for that exact question, put a tin of Aunt Beryl\u2019s apricot jam in his hand and said, \u201cTell her it\u2019s for toast and thanks,\u201d and Trevor cut the rail with a carefulness that would have shamed a surgeon and then hammered it against his own knee until it made a brutal circle.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get a rash under that,\u201d Trevor said, cheerful as a storm. \u201cDon\u2019t scratch. Bandage. Rub it with spit. Wash it in vinegar. Keep both your hands. I like your hands. They look like they should be breaking things that need to be broken.\u201d\n\nKip slid the iron over his wrist and his breath hitched in a way he hadn\u2019t expected, a small skip as if music had changed key. It was ugly. It was perfect. For a wild useless moment he wanted someone to see it and kiss it like it meant they understood something about him. He settled for the itch and the ache that told him he was less likely to step sideways out of his own body like a bored ghost. He thanked Trevor three times in different registers and left before he said something sentimental and got beaten with a newspaper for his trouble.\n\nThe day had grown fat around the edges by the time he got to the university gardens with his string bag of kitchen leavings. For The Love Of Worms was there again in her bright pink, her hat now adorned with a laminated map of the composting system and a badge that said ask me about leachate in a font too happy for the word. She took his bag with reverence; she had the worshipper\u2019s eye when it came to banana peels. \u201cWe had a possum try to convert last night,\u201d she said, meaning a raid, meaning pest management, and pointed with her chin at a little patch of fence that had been chewed into because a possum had thought the answer to hunger was inside. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand about patience.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of us don\u2019t,\u201d Kip said, and then he saw the rat. She sat on top of the newest heap with her hands folded on her little belly, looking like a grandmother over soup. Beside her was a teenager rat with a torn ear and the restless look of someone who wanted to graffiti his own name on a moving tram. When Kip sketched a greeting in the careful loose language of gutter, the mother rat flattened her ears and skittered two steps closer as if to be polite and also in case there was bread.\n\n\u201cNobody told me there would be sauces,\u201d she said, because she smelled the orange peels and coffee grounds and eggshells like spices, and Kip bowed with deeper respect than he had used in the carpeted room. \u201cMrs Ipswich,\u201d she added to save him embarrassment of guessing. \u201cMy boy calls himself Knife because of course he does. He does not bite unless asked. Which he is frequently and unreasonably asked. We watch your piles now. It keeps us moral. I told the girls on the bridge to leave your worm beds alone because once I got fat on a pie near the train station and it made me stupid. Carbs are a trap.\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs Ipswich, I need a set of eyes with whiskers,\u201d Kip said, thinking of corners under roads and places where drains breathed slowly like asthmatics. \u201cI need to know if the smell I am training goes where I tell it and not where it shouldn\u2019t. Will you be my municipal inspector? I can pay in the ends of things and in ensuring that the traps the council sets are sprung closed before the men with boots remember them.\u201d\n\nMrs Ipswich blinked in that rat way that is skeptical and pleased. \u201cIt is always men with boots,\u201d she said, because female rats had made a study of the category and found it wanting. \u201cYes, bright boy. We will watch. But in return we want a corridor. A safe one. A pipe from here to the river where no one batters us with a shovel. We want our children to learn to swim without being taught by garbage.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can do that,\u201d For The Love Of Worms put in, because she had a heart large enough to include rodents if it meant the compost went undisturbed. \u201cLook, if we re-purpose the old greywater outflow, and we talk to Facilities about putting a grate with a hinge on it, the kids can go in and out like they\u2019re residents. We can write a sign: RATS ONLY. Then if anyone objects I can tell them it\u2019s part of a research project.\u201d\n\nKip could have kissed them both. He restrained himself and put his silly specificity where it counted, in a small plan that was a big shape. He walked the perimeter, he hummed luck like a joke with its hand over its mouth, he named the path Mrs Ipswich and Knife would use with a little sideways magic that made it look to human eyes like an inconvenience and to rat eyes like a lane in Paris. He left crumbs of his own thinking along it like the pips of a fruit he wasn\u2019t sure about yet. He set the first proper task for Rot-Right without going underground: he stood beside the newest heap, warm as breath, and said as even as he knew how, \u201cTake this heat and make it into soil that says thank you when we step on it. Keep it here. Keep ahead of the flies. No games with tongues that aren\u2019t yours.\u201d\n\nThe answer came not as a word but as a change in texture, a little settling as if a hand had smoothed a bedspread and promised to come back with tea. The smell was not sweet, and it was not cruel. It was a working smell, a job. Kip breathed it and felt the ring on his wrist throb once in time with his pulse, and for the first time since the tunnel he did not immediately think about his thumb. He thought about worms with the contentment of a parish priest thinking about his congregation and their silly, earnest sins.\n\nFrom the gardens he went to find Tansy, not because he could not go under alone\u2014he could now, easily, the iron made it simple to behave\u2014but because he had been told not to and he was a boy who had discovered that sometimes rules are not an affront but a kindness offered across a table. He found her on her smoke break, which was to say she stood near the rubbish bins with her hoodie up and her arms folded and the fake cigarette behind her ear because she had decided to give up again for the fifth time this year. She had a face that would have made a saint shape her behavior; she used it to make teenagers pick up their litter and to convince grown men that there was not a single chip left.\n\nHe did not say, I want you because I am frightened of who I am in the dark. He said, \u201cWant to come under the bridge with me and talk to something rude?\u201d and she tipped her head back and groaned because he knew what gifts to bring.\n\n\u201cLet me get my boots,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we should bring Jet because she will cry if she hears she was left out, and also because she will complain loudly enough to attract help if we do something truly idiotic. Also Alan. Alan is a good counterweight. He\u2019s all right angles and bolts. I like the way he refuses to use the right wrench out of principle.\u201d\n\nThey collected their company like cheese and crackers. Jet turned up with a windcheater that said Swim Team even though she did not swim; she liked uniforms on other people. Alan\u2014or Allen or Allan depending on which hardware store had given him a loyalty card that week\u2014met them with a bag of screws he had been listening to all morning. He looked like a walking toolbox, and he had a worrying habit of falling in love with machines. Kip loved him for the way he steadied the air when he stood in it. He took them to the Prince\u2019s Bridge and then, because he had promised, he did the unglamorous thing of standing still and making sure everyone had a way back out before they went in.\n\nUnder the bridge it was damp and complicated. The day\u2019s heat had curled into itself and made a smell like old library and tar. Kip felt the first brush of Rot-Right along his jaw in a greeting that was insolent and domestic at once, and he raised an eyebrow at the air as if disapproving of a cousin with bad jokes. \u201cWe brought witnesses,\u201d he said aloud because it mattered. \u201cWe brought friends. We brought someone who will hit me if I go sideways.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d Tansy said. \u201cI have been practicing open-hand slaps on wallabies who steal sandwiches.\u201d\n\nJet peered at the darkness and then at Kip, her eyes going minnows again. \u201cIt won\u2019t stick to me, will it? I have my school carnival next week and if I vomit on the starting block again I have to go to church.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t stick,\u201d Kip said, easy as a lie that happened to be true today, and he felt Rot-Right\u2019s attention flick to Jet and then away, sensing the wrong meal. He moved his fingers through the air in a pattern Aunt Beryl called a grandmother\u2019s weave when she taught him to keep busy hands busy and tied their threads to his own elbow and to the iron and to Tansy\u2019s scowling mouth. \u201cHello,\u201d he said, as if this were a neighbor\u2019s kitchen and he had brought scones. \u201cWe have rules. We have a job. Do you want to meet my friends and not scare them?\u201d\n\nIt came like fog does, all at once and also not at all. The smell rose and spread and then settled lower, a polite guest conscious of their own heavy perfume. Alan made a face that suggested he had licked a battery. Tansy breathed through her mouth and glared, which made the smell pull itself in a fraction like a dog told to leave it. Jet stood on one foot and then the other and muttered, \u201cIt\u2019s not as big as Birdie said. She said it was like the smell of a fish two buses ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt changes,\u201d Kip said, and put his hand on the tunnel wall so he could feel the water, its lazy rush. \u201cRot-Right. This is Tansy. Do not tease her. She will break your nose and you will discover you had one. This is Jet. She is new and thus very precious. You will not bite her. This is Alan. He keeps the metal in this city from sulking. He will tell you to mind your own business with drains. You will obey him because he has a wrench and no tolerance for nonsense.\u201d\n\nThere was a sensation like a nod, a lowering of temperature that wasn\u2019t cold but that made the hair stand up on their arms. Alan squared up to the air as if he were at a tradesman convention and said with all the dignity of a man in love with bolts, \u201cThat grate on the west side needs a new bracket. Don\u2019t lean on it. I\u2019ll bring a proper one tomorrow. If you eat the bracket, I will come down here with a magnet and retrieve every small piece of you that adheres and use you to attract screws at a market stall.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like him,\u201d Rot-Right said inside Kip\u2019s voice, borrowing his mouth just enough to make the others twitch. Kip surrendered an inch and then took it back. He had promised not to make bargains without asking. He made a show of spitting on his thumb and wiping the wall to break the shape. Tansy did not hit him, but she did flick his ear hard, which was mathematics of a sort.\n\nThey walked a slow loop through the section of drain that had been worst the day before. The heavy sense of hunger had thinned in the corners, replaced by a slick little satisfaction, and every time he felt it Kip named it again in his head, softly, like laying out teaspoons: Worm\u2019s-Hand, Bin-King, Sour-With-Purpose. At one bend, where the silt made a shape like an ear listening, they came upon something new: a stain on the stain, a smear of black that did not belong to any story he knew. It smelled not of rot but of solvent, the hateful clean of something that eats paint. Alan went on one knee like a man proposing to a chemical and examined without touching. Tansy swore under her breath in the delicate river language of frogs. Jet said, \u201cUgh,\u201d like a child at a butcher\u2019s window.\n\n\u201cNot ours,\u201d Alan said in the tone that meant he will call in favors for this. \u201cIndustrial. Somebody poured something down the wrong throat. They do that when they think nobody watches.\u201d\n\n\u201cCHOICES?\u201d Jet asked, because the acronym had turned into a game at school, into whispers and dares. \u201cDo we call and ask them to forget it for us?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tansy said with a firmness that made the dark look safer. \u201cCHOICES will forget the wrong bit and leave us with the man who thinks that the best way to clean a stovetop is bleach and fire. We call Aunt Beryl because she knows people with hoses. We tell the Anchor because she knows how to frighten a foreman without moving from her chair. We tell For The Love Of Worms because she will chain herself to a pipe and get on the news.\u201d\n\nKip felt Rot-Right push away from the black smear, offended, which was a relief and an alarm. He could use offense. He could turn insult into appetite for the right thing. He could also watch it make a new hunger, and there were only so many rules you could tie onto a living idea before it gnawed through boredom. He took a breath and then another, setting his ribs like a net against a hard, slippery pull. \u201cLeave that,\u201d he said aloud for clarity. \u201cNot yours. Not mine. We will get brooms. We will get buckets. We will do this like stupid humans in yellow vests and hats. You can watch and be self-righteous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a mood,\u201d Tansy murmured, amused despite the sting in her nose. \u201cI like this version of you. It suits the iron.\u201d\n\nThey marked the place with chalk and an argument with the stone, which would hold until morning. On the way out, Jet snagged her toes on something bright and picked up a small plastic bracelet that said LiveStrong in the remnant language of a charity that had meant well and then gone sideways. She turned it in her fingers as if expecting it to speak. Kip took it and made a face and then slid it onto the iron as a joke that would either make the universe chuckle or take it personally. It made his wrist look like a child had decorated a prisoner. He liked the dissonance. He made it a promise to remember that good intentions are not armor. He made it an oath with plastic for a seal.\n\nThey emerged into late afternoon and the kind of light that makes even ugly buildings look like they have meant to be that way. The smell of hot chips and sunscreen rushed them like lovers who had been waiting for months. On the promenade, Aunt Beryl was pretending to mind her own business and failing; she had a sense for when her people went under rocks. She had a hose in one hand and a bucket in the other and two teenage boys behind her already wearing high-visibility vests that clashed offendly with their aesthetic. \u201cWe are going to be stupid humans now,\u201d she said briskly. \u201cI told the council it was a community art project. They said okay because they thought it would keep us busy. If anyone asks, we are painting things that only show up when it rains.\u201d\n\nTansy kissed her on the cheek and took a vest; Jet pretended to hate hers and then straightened it so that it sat right on her narrow shoulders. Alan hefted a broom like a weapon he had been born to wield, and Mrs Ipswich appeared on the lip of a gutter with four of her girls and six boys, all eyes and whisker, and announced that they would appreciate a break in the gendered labor division and take that far corner. Kip took a breath and then another and felt his bones count themselves.\n\nThey worked until their backs spoke fluent complaint. They scrubbed and swept and made jokes of the kind that make work light even when work is mud and chemicals and fear dressed up as seriousness. Aunt Beryl sang a baking song and made it rude; Jet invented harmonies that were wrong on purpose; Alan lectured the drain about respect with the tone of a man who will teach his toaster to regard toast as a vocation. The black smear lightened and then broke, and when the first strip came away there was a smell like rubber promises and Kip had to hold his breath and say his own name twice to not make a door with his mouth and pull the wrong thing in to eat it all in one gulp.\n\n\u201cHat,\u201d the Anchor said later, when they took their wet vests to the caf\u00e9 and hung them outside as if they were flags of an improbable nation. She had turned up without anyone seeing her arrive, as she did. \u201cIf you are going to do this thing where you make municipal work look like a sacrament, wear a hat. The sun will steal your sense otherwise, and then I have to hold your ears on when they fall off.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a hat for worm day,\u201d Kip said, hearing himself sound sixteen and feeling no shame in it. \u201cIt has a badge.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course it has a badge,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything you wear has an opinion.\u201d She plucked at the plastic bracelet on his iron and made a face. \u201cThis is tasteless and perfect. I approved of that charity until it turned out the man was a man. Keep it. Let it annoy me.\u201d\n\nThey fed themselves like children after sport: chips, battered fish, a noble salad Tansy insisted on that tasted better than it had a right to. The city moved around them in the kindly way some places have when they are pleased with what their people are up to. Kip felt Rot-Right sit at his shoulder like a dog allowed inside for once, head on paws, watching with bright greedy little eyes and refraining from begging because it had been taught that it could not put its nose on the table. He wanted to stroke the air and say good job and that felt like a perversion; he resisted and ate his chips and told Jet to stop putting vinegar on everything because she was making the paper melt.\n\nNight brought new rumors like candy in pockets. Someone sent a message that the underpass near the old tallow works had started to sing. Someone else said a man had taken off his shoes by the botanic gardens lake and walked in and then walked out again and claimed he had seen a horse, which meant old fire had rolled over something and made it a picture. A woman came to the caf\u00e9 with a child who had the leftover emptiness of a morning\u2019s sickness behind her eyes, and Una came by and sat for a minute and told Tansy that the bath had a stubborn taste at the shallow end like someone had boiled a kettle in it and then put their hand in and shouted. Kip listened and did the arithmetic that this city makes you do when you love it: how much? how bad? who do we call? what in exchange?\n\nHe could have stopped there, made the day his flag, slept the sleep of a person with a ring on their wrist and rules on their tongue. He could, but other appetites in other people don\u2019t obey even the best intentions. Around midnight, too late for a decent soul and too early for a sinner, his phone\u2014a thing he owned both ironically and because a rat queen had insisted\u2014buzzed with a message that had not come down any network he paid for. It was in the shape of scent, which is to say it didn\u2019t show on the screen and it made him swallow before he answered. It said: child, hurry. It said: old fat old fat old fat, which was Rot-Right\u2019s shorthand for trouble in a place where once animals had fed a city and now only ghosts did. He didn\u2019t wake Tansy or call Jet or drag Alan out of bed like a lover with bad timing. He got as far as thinking of their faces and then stopped with his hand on the door because the iron on his wrist had heated to a slow warn. He had promised. He had said he would not go alone. He stood there and let that irritation that always lived at the back of him rise until he could taste its lemon, and then he sent three messages that looked like prayers and were just logistics.\n\nThe tallow works had been a stink and a half in their day, a religion of fat. People had once dipped their hands into tallow and rubbed it into leather and hair, had boiled it and made candles, had carted it off in barrels that leaked and made dogs love whatever road it had touched. Now it was brick and memory and signage with sepia photographs of stern men who had never learned to smile without a pipe. The drains underneath had eaten a thousand small deaths and could not be expected to pretend they hadn\u2019t. When Kip and his tired small army went down with torches and buckets and the foolishness that makes citizens out of us, he felt the place rise like a bear out of sleep and had to make himself larger inside to not be taken for an intruder. Tansy had brought a bag of coffee grounds and sacrilege\u2014someone\u2019s leftover gravy in a jar\u2014and Jet had a superstition in her pocket in the shape of a coin that had been run over by a train and come out more patient. Alan had a bolt from a ship that had never found its home and wanted one; he carried it like a dog carries a toy.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the same as before. That mattered. The black solvent-smear glowed in their torchlight in a way that felt wrong, and the smell that rose was not Rot-Right\u2019s humble pantry. It made Kip think of a hospital corridor lit too bright with bleach, and for a moment he swayed and had to find the rail with his hand and hear the iron on his wrist sing. He didn\u2019t so much see as understand that someone had not poured waste in fear or laziness this time. Someone had practiced. The smear sat in the corner like a prank, like a man with a hat pulled low waiting to watch people slip.\n\n\u201cNot accident,\u201d Alan said softly, and if he had not had both hands on his broom he would have found a way to hit something that could be blamed. \u201cNot stupid. This is done with an idea. And it\u2019s the wrong idea.\u201d\n\nJet edged behind Tansy as if she were smaller and needed the height. \u201cWho would do that?\u201d she asked, genuinely bewildered. \u201cWho would pour poison on purpose where children go to get rid of their fears?\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople who want to sell something,\u201d Tansy said. \u201cPeople who make you frightened and then hand you a bottle with a label that says salvation and a price tag that makes your teeth hurt. Or bored men who want to see if they can get in a paper. Or, gods help me, someone like Kip who thinks he can keep a lid on a thing and then forgets that lids are for pots, not ponds.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Kip said, and then, to his own surprise, laughed because she had offered him a mean little gift: the chance to reject guilt that wasn\u2019t his, and he cherished those. \u201cThis one doesn\u2019t smell like me. It smells like\u2014\u201d He stopped because he had to chew the idea before it could be words. \u201cIt smells like removal. Not decay. It wants things to go away without consequence. It is the opposite of us.\u201d\n\nRot-Right bristled inside him like a cat when a dog is mentioned. He felt it push itself between him and the smear, not to eat it but to stand there as if insulted by the chemistry. It made a new smell he had not smelled on it before, a bitter pride, and he realized with a start of something like hope that giving anything a job makes it jealous of that job\u2019s dignity. It wanted to be the only sovereign of certain filths. He could use that. He could ride it like a bad pony if he was careful.\n\n\u201cEat around it,\u201d he said, soft, and Rot-Right rolled its shoulders like a boxer and did what it was told, taking the edges of filth and turning them, taste by taste, into something a worm would smile for. The center stain sulked and did not change. Alan crossed himself in a way that was not church but habit, and Tansy folded her arms so that nobody could see that the tiny hairs on them had lifted.\n\nThey set to with buckets and old cloths. They worked like fools. Aunt Beryl arrived with a bottle of vinegar and the stinging voice of someone who once ran a kitchen where men had bled on chopping boards and bragged about it. The Anchor did not come, but the feeling of her did, the sense of a keel under them, and Kip found himself talking to the dark about why drains matter as if he were a teacher and not a boy with too many talents he had not learned to hide. He talked and worked and held his wrist steady when the iron made him want to scratch until he bled. He did not let Rot-Right play with the fear that started slow in Jet\u2019s ribs and built when they found a small dead fish where it should not have been. He paid attention to brick and flow and bolts. He made himself a man doing a job instead of a story trying to write itself.\n\nWhen they were done, it wasn\u2019t done-done. It was better. It was a promise that someone saw. It was a warning. On the way back to the light, they met a man in a hi-vis vest with a council logo and clipboards for hands. He had the look of someone who had read a policy and married it, and his smile was the kind that had to be practiced. \u201cEvening,\u201d he said. \u201cCommunity engagement?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Kip said in a voice that could have been a lie and wasn\u2019t. \u201cWe are engaging the community with ourselves as they are too busy to come along. We are going to put up a sign that says we do not pour death here.\u201d\n\nThe man looked at their buckets and their black streaked cuffs and Aunt Beryl\u2019s vinegar and Allen\u2019s broom and Jet\u2019s coin and Tansy\u2019s don\u2019t-test-me and he adjusted his expectations on the spot like a belt. \u201cWe had a call,\u201d he said, and flicked through papers as if the answer would be printed for him so he wouldn\u2019t have to summon it. \u201cFrom CHOICES. They said there were reports of a\u2026 smell. But that it had been dealt with.\u201d\n\n\u201cCHOICES would tell you we died to save you and then ask for a signature,\u201d Aunt Beryl said with sweet venom. \u201cHelp us with the sign. Or get out of the way.\u201d\n\nHe got out of the way. After he had, he stood with his clipboard and watched them finish by the light of phones and stubborn, and there was a tiny shift in his spine that said something had moved in him where rules live. He would go home and tell someone who wore a tie that he had seen a thing that worked, and he would take credit, and maybe next time he would bring gloves and not tell his boss.\n\nThat night Kip slept without the sea talking in his ear. He slept without drains. He dreamt, briefly, of a worm in a top hat conducted by a rat with a baton. He woke laughing in that helpless way that makes your ribs ache and then found his iron ring pressed a round mark into his skin and itched like truth. He did not take it off. He did not scratch. He rubbed vinegar into it as instructed and thought of Trevor\u2019s grave cheer. Then he went out into a day that had not been made new by his labor and was nevertheless a little brighter in the corners where he had scrubbed.\n\nHe forgot, for a precious hour between breakfast and the hour when the sun reminds everyone that their bodies are animals, that he was interesting. He sat in the library and read a pamphlet about municipal waste with serious attention and translated its bureaucrat into person speech in his head. He made notes with a pencil Aunt Beryl had sharpened with a knife. He thought about what he would say at worm day that would make old men put their fingers into a bucket and come up smiling. He wrote ROT RIGHT in big letters and then crossed it out and wrote ROT-RIGHT with a hyphen and then circled it and then put a line through that too because the Anchor would smack his head for trying to brand an idea that wasn\u2019t finished. He frowned at the word leachate so hard that a woman across from him laughed behind her laptop and he looked up and smiled with his mouth like a shy dog.\n\nThe city did not leave him that hour as a gift without price. At eleven, his phone sang out with a ringtone he had not set and would not have chosen\u2014bagpipes; the universe is a comedian with poor taste. It was not Aunt Beryl or Tansy or Alan or Mrs Ipswich with gossip. It was a number he didn\u2019t know and a voice he recognized from two meetings ago, a suit voice with friendliness sprayed on. \u201cKip,\u201d it said, and he could see the man\u2019s shiny shoes and his fear of having his tie pulled by a toddler. \u201cWe are so excited about your demonstration. We\u2019ve had a wonderful idea. There\u2019s a developer coming to have a look at the waterfront and we think it would be marvelous if you could do your little show just when he walks past. It will show community spirit. It will show that we are, ah, responsible. It will show that the smell\u2014what smell?\u2014isn\u2019t an issue. You understand.\u201d\n\nThe ring on his wrist ate three heartbeats and spat them back out hot. Kip breathed once and then left the library because he did not want to say no under that polite quiet. He walked out into lemon and steel and the taste of expanding day and let himself be his most harmless voice while he sharpened it underneath. \u201cI understand that you want to hire me for free to make a man feel less afraid of something he should be very afraid of if he wants to put his name on it,\u201d he said, kindly. \u201cI understand that you will put my name on a flyer in small letters and then throw it away. I understand that if I say yes this time you will ask and ask until I say no rudely and then you will say community engagement is so hard. I will do my demonstration for the people who bring banana peels in their pockets. If your man is one of those, he is welcome. If not, he can watch me love dirt and be confused.\u201d\n\nThere was a little silence. It had paperwork around it. Then the voice said, pleasant in a way that would look like teeth if you could see it, \u201cI don\u2019t think you appreciate\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are correct,\u201d Kip said and hung up because Aunt Beryl had once taught him there is a kind of magic in ending a conversation before the other person has written your line for you. He put his phone in his pocket and let his ears ring in a way that wasn\u2019t a hex but would do. Then he went to the garden and checked on the piles. Then he went to the bath and put his hands in and did nothing except let the tiles tell him who had put their feet there and been afraid and learned not to be. Then he went to the Anchor and sat with her while she knitted enough for someone with hips. They did not talk about anything that needed a name.\n\nTowards evening, he found a child on the promenade staring into the gaps between planks with the seriousness of someone who has lost something important. She had a plait that was too tight and shoes that had been carefully chosen because they flashed when she stepped in a certain way. Her mother was on a bench doing the long deep breathing of a person who is on the edge of the day and of tears and does not have the luxury of either. Kip crouched with his knees making agreeable noises and said, \u201cWhat is missing?\u201d and the child said, \u201cMy fish is in the water,\u201d with the dignity of a person who is already rehearsing loss. He put his face close to the gap and saw a plastic fish with a stupid grin and something else in the water, something that had no grin. He put his fingers down and almost put them into a smell. He did not. He used his light and he used a small shape he had kept since he was too small to do anything but play\u2014hook-and-pull\u2014and he lifted the toy. The child did not smile. She looked at him as if she had expected it to be simple and everything else to be harder. He put the fish in her hand and said, because it was the only vow that mattered, \u201cWe don\u2019t eat what you love,\u201d and the water under him agreed so sweetly he could have wept.\n\nHe would break his rules soon. He was that kind of creature. He would go down alone because someone\u2019s breath would be running out and because he trusted himself too much and because Rot-Right would laugh like he did and promise. He would do it; he knew it like knowing your own calf muscle in the night. But not today. Today he had an iron ring and a rat queen and a woman in pink who loved worms like they were saints. He had an Anchor who had told him he was ordinary and made it sound like a blessing. He had Aunt Beryl\u2019s cake in a tin on top of a fridge with a note on it that said touch and die and a smaller note under it that said unless you are hungry. He had a smell that now wore a badge that said municipal and a set of knees that made him remember to stand carefully on wet steps.\n\nWhen he went to sleep, he put the ring on a string and ran the string up to the hook Aunt Beryl had once used to hang herbs to dry. He slept with his hand tangled in it so that if he stirred, it would pull and he would remember there was gravity and that he had agreed. In his dream, a gull stole a hot chip and then brought it back because it had forgotten how to chew and Rot-Right, in a little cap like a stationmaster, showed it how, patiently, cheap and expert at once. In the morning he woke to fingernails against a window and for a long raspberry of a second he was back in the tunnel. He sat up fast enough to pull the string and make the iron knock his wrist and wince and swear, and then he saw the culprit: a boy with a face mostly made of good intentions holding a flyer against the glass. It said WORM DAY in letters that had been written by an optimist and then traced by a pessimist, and under it Aunt Beryl had written in texta bring your stink. He did not know he was laughing until his ribs protested. He dressed. He made a list that included words like signage and buckets and children and Mrs Ipswich and Alan\u2019s bracket. He went to work. He let himself be ridiculous about it. He hummed a song about leachate and decided he did not care if it had too many syllables. He was, for the moment and with an ugly ring telling him a story every time it itched, an honest boy with a job.",

                              "content": "The morning opened itself like a door that had been painted too often and stuck, then gave way with a sigh and a flake of old color, and everything behind it smelled of cardboard and grass. Kip arrived at the university gardens carrying two buckets of coffee grounds and a bag that clinked with jars because Aunt Beryl believed in samples, publicity, and sugar in equal portions. His hat had a badge on it that declared him an enthusiast of microfauna and the pin the Anchor had stuck in his cuff did not behave like jewelry; it behaved like a nail through a plank and made his sleeve sit different. The iron ring sat on his wrist under the bright yellow of a reused festival wristband that said in wobbly text WORM DAY while the old LiveStrong bracelet took the whole combination very seriously and made grown men smirk and then look away because irony felt risky around someone with a job.\n\nFor The Love Of Worms had turned the lawn into a fair that wouldn\u2019t scare a crow, which took skill. There were trestles with laminated signboards articulating the romance of leachate, a kid\u2019s corner with cardboard tubes that allowed small people to emulate an earthworm without suffocation, and three plastic tubs of finished compost with wooden spoons for people to turn and smell so they would remember that the word humus wasn\u2019t a dip but a hymn. Her real name turned out to be Maureen if you caught her hat off, which no one did unless she wanted them to, and she had recruited two science students with hands like puppies to man the stall that sold tiny worm farms in clear boxes so people could pretend to be gods and then discover they didn\u2019t like having that much responsibility. Mrs Ipswich and Knife perched on the edge of a straw bale like judges on a cooking show, washing their whiskers with an air of moral superiority that would have been unbearable in any creature without a tail, and their cousins patrolled the freshly hinged grate that led to the safe corridor like they had been municipal staff all their lives.\n\nAlan had parked himself at the point most likely to be mistaken for structural vulnerability and hung his new bracket from his belt as a talisman while he explained to a boy in a scooter helmet that screws have desires and you can either listen or strip them and live with your shame. Tansy ran the book for swaps, which meant a handwritten list of who had brought banana peels and who had delivered eggshells and who was now owed a baggie of soil in return, and she made sly marks in the corner for those who left their contributions in plastic. Jet wore a high-vis vest that drowned her and had a whistle that she was not allowed to use and therefore could not stop touching. Aunt Beryl stood behind a table that had a sign in texta that read CAKE and had iced three slab cakes with the same word in three different languages because she liked showing off and because if someone complained, she could pretend it was accidental.\n\nThe council had lent them bunting in the shape of leaves that made the worm farm look like it was celebrating an election, and someone had convinced a band of local teenagers to play a set of songs about soil that were nearly comprehensible and very sincere. A man from Facilities trudged up with a cone witch\u2019s hat that said wet floor and then, realizing that if he put it on the lawn it would symbolize damp grass, he endured a crisis of ontology that he solved by giving it to Jet and asking her not to wear it, which she immediately did. The day was not hot enough to be cruel and not cold enough to test anyone\u2019s vows; it was a good day with a small shiver running through it like a cat under a table thinking about knocking over a vase.\n\nKip felt Rot-Right in his ribs and his knees and the skin inside his wrists, present the way warmth is present in bread not long out of an oven, and he had to keep an eye on it the way you keep an eye on children who have just discovered carrying chairs over their heads. He was very good at being ordinary when there was an audience for it, which is to say he had practiced being a version of himself that let other people talk and then talked back in ways that did not scare them. His job today was to take the idea of rot, which most people thought of as failure, and dress it like a success in a suit made of tomatoes and a tie made of the laughter that happens when a person who thinks they hate gardening puts their nose into soil and comes away stunned. He threaded his iron ring around the handle of a shovel for a moment to ground himself, felt it bite, and put it back where it belonged with care that would have looked superstitious if anyone had been watching closely.\n\nThe suits arrived later than they said and overprepared, carrying branded water bottles and expressions that had been practiced in mirrors until the wrinkles at the edges of their eyes knew when to do their dance. They came with a developer whose shoes had never met a cow pat and who wore his confidence like sunscreen, thick and shiny and not entirely rubbed in. He had a name that tasted of forest and concrete at once and he said it without offering it, leaving it to be taken from the air, and the council liaison who had tried to book Kip for free vibrated beside him like a small generator powering hope. CHOICES drifted by in the form of a woman with a clipboard and a relaxed jaw; if you put a hand near her the air felt like the moment a burp is swallowed with shame, and she managed to stand in the shade of nothing. Kip saw them, put them in the corner of his pocket where you put a coin you don\u2019t want to spend without forgetting you have it, and went on retrieving banana peels from bags with gratitude like he was being offered diamonds.\n\nHe began his talk by not talking. He let quiet sit on the grass for a little while, not long enough for anyone to grow bored, just long enough for the gulls to complain that nothing exciting was happening and go elsewhere. He held up a jar of coffee grounds and a jar of orange peels and a handful of eggshells and the small damp body of a cabbage leaf, and he put them one by one into a clear bin as if he were building a cake that no child would recognize as cake until someone sliced it. Then he reached into the tub of finished compost and pulled up a handful of crumbly black that did not clump and did not stink, and he dusted it across the grass in a gentle arc like salting a story and asked people to come smell it, please, right now, with no dignity, with their whole faces.\n\nThere is a trick to making strangers choose to embarrass themselves in a wholesome way, and Kip had been taught it by Aunt Beryl and perfected it in the draught of a city that doesn\u2019t like to be told to pay attention unless it is being offered a free sausage. He took the first few hesitant noses and made them seem brave, he made the laugh that says I\u2019m silly and it\u2019s fine arrive before anyone needed it, and he kept his voice low so people had to lean in and miss nothing. When the first old man made the face and the first child made the gasp and the first woman let her shoulders go in a way that said she had not realized she had been holding them on purpose for years, the thing took itself on like yeast in water, and the crowd ceased to be an audience and became participants in the business of liking rot for the first time in daylight.\n\nHe spoke then, and he did not say decay; he said return. He did not say breakdown; he said back to, and he didn\u2019t make metaphors about death even though he could have balanced five without spilling one. He talked about worms as stomachs that make soil who are also mouths, about bacteria as small workers to whom we owe wages paid in peels and leaves and the patient end of lettuce, and he let people hold worms in their palms if they promised to be quiet with their fingers. He asked the children to name three things they would not eat\u2014no children\u2019s tears, no plastic, no chicken bones\u2014and then asked the same children to name three things their worms would love, and he let the answers be wrong until they weren\u2019t. He could feel Rot-Right settling into its municipal jacket like a dog allowed to stay inside on a wet day for the first time and told not to get on the couch, and every time he felt it lean toward a fear for the taste, he nudged it with a thought the way you nudge a steering wheel to keep a car between the lines.\n\nThere was a wheelie bin in the shade of a peppercorn that should not have been there because nothing should be where it was, and even if Kip hadn\u2019t noticed it with his eyes, Mrs Ipswich\u2019s whisker-twitch would have drawn a thin red line around it in the air. Knife stood beside it with his bad ear forward and his good ear flat and his eyes narrowed as if listening to a small radio station no one had paid to put on the dial. Jet drifted that way because she had the dangerous talent children have for moving toward trouble while looking like they were taking responsibly for a small plant, and Tansy corrected her path with two fingers like a neat wind. A smell in the bin tried to make itself ordinary and overshot; it arrived as sterilized courage and the memory of dentist rooms, and the Anchor\u2019s pin warmed against Kip\u2019s wrist under the band of words and plastic and iron until he wanted to scratch and had to not.\n\nHe did not interrupt his talk about the speed of the worm gut and the dangers of too much citrus in a small system, because panic can be a kind of chemical too. He said, \u201cEveryone rub a little of this\u201d\u2014and he made a cut across his own palm with his voice to give permission\u2014\u201con your wrists where you can smell it later, and you will think nice things about your grandmother who had a garden even if she didn\u2019t. If you don\u2019t have a grandmother, borrow Aunt Beryl, but bring her back in time for cake.\u201d They did it because people like instructions that give them a story to tell about the odd smear on their skin, and the act of putting dirt where perfume goes lodged a small, ridiculous oath in place: remember. He looked at Maureen and she lifted her eyebrows at the bin without moving her head because she did not want to frighten her worms or her guests, and Kip nodded gently and directed his talk so that his moving body put him between the bin and the most persuadable faces.\n\nThe developer made an attempt at sincerity that might have worked in a different town. He held up a worm farm like a prop and talked about circular economies with the rhythm of a man who had memorized the right nouns, and he tried to put a name on what Kip had done that would make it into an asset that could be toured like a model home. Kip let him talk. He smiled with attention and held a worm and corrected a child softly and helped a woman get past a small fear of small cold things, and when the man with the shoes said the words Bio-Opportunity with three hyphens, Aunt Beryl dropped a cake on the table with the force of a sermon and the syllables fell apart and rotted on the grass in a way that made three teenagers laugh into their sleeves. CHOICES fluttered closer as if unwilling to miss an opening, and Kip felt the sedative of forgetting walk past them in sensible shoes and try to shake his hand. He turned his palm at the last moment and had it shake a clod of compost instead, and the small movement was enough to make the council liaison\u2019s smile fall off like a button that had been hanging on by habit.\n\nThey found the bin\u2019s problem without making a scene because the rats had experience with avoiding hysteria in public. Knife leapt light onto Maureen\u2019s table and slapped the hinge of the lid with both paws as if hitting a tambourine, and Tansy took the hint and slid a gloved hand under the rim and held it there long enough for the smell to make a new shape that could be named. Alan stepped in with his best look that said I am a man you do not want to argue with about regulations no matter who you are, and he said, loud enough to make the CHOICES clipboard flinch, \u201cThis is not organic. This is not fit for soil. This is a solvent with a label that has had a label peeled off it, which any fool knows leaves the sticky behind, and I know my stickies. Who brought this into a garden?\u201d\n\nThere is the kind of silence that is an absence, and then there is the kind that is a presence that has put a heavy thing on a table and dares you to say you didn\u2019t see it. The developer\u2019s mouth went into a shape that wanted to be a circle and became a line, and the council man discovered that squinting would not make the old brand name on the bottle\u2019s shoulder un-ghost: MISTRAL 90 in letters that thought they were clean. The CHOICES woman put her clipboard against her chest like a shield and began to say something about intervening when the community begins to hallucinate hazards that are outside its capacity to process, and the Anchor\u2019s pin burned his cuff like breath. Rot-Right pressed its nose against the inside of his teeth like a bored dog who has been very good and sees a ball. Kip breathed dirt into his own throat on purpose and let it scratch.\n\nHe did not make a speech about sabotage. He didn\u2019t need the day to break into sides when it had only just learned to be a circle. He said instead, \u201cSometimes people get confused about what removes and what returns. Sometimes it is an accident and sometimes it is a man in a suit with an old grudge against anything that makes him feel like he has to learn a new word. We don\u2019t have to work out which today.\u201d He took the bottle, which felt offended in his hand, and he set it aside without pomp and asked Maureen to bring the vinegar and the bicarb and the bucket that had been christened for emergencies. He brought the children forward like firefighters with small hands and gave them small jobs with grand titles and kept them talking about their favorite smells while the stinging kind tried to tell their noses a different story and was drowned in domestic charisma. The developer attempted to look helpful and held a funnel, which was probably the first useful thing he had done in months that did not involve a spreadsheet.\n\nAfter they had poured and scrubbed and apologized to the worms for the noise, Maureen took off her hat to scratch and revealed hair like the inside of a tree, and without ceremony she reached down to the edge of the main heap and brought up a stone the size of a loaf of bread that did not look like it had been there yesterday. It had the particular weight of stone carried, a heat under its cool, and its color was the sound of sleep. She didn\u2019t seem surprised by it, and Kip did not need her to be. The You Yang aunties had a habit of sending what was necessary when it was time to stop pretending that volunteers can do everything with cheerful signage. The auntie had signed her work in the curve of the rock, a shallow arc that made your wrist relax when you held it, and in the rounded place on one side where you could set your palm and feel the slow breathing that only hills permit themselves when nobody is watching.\n\n\u201cThat goes under,\u201d Maureen said, with the authority of someone who had been told what to do by people with a view of the bay and had no intention of arguing. \u201cIt will keep the heat from getting silly. It will remind us that we are not the first to play with rot and that we will not be the last. No stickers. No hashtags. Just gratitude.\u201d Kip set the stone at the base of the new heap like a keel, and when his fingers left it, he felt the whole pile sit down comfortably, like a person taking their shoes off at the end of a shift, and he breathed with it and took a little of its calm into a pocket in his chest that had been yawning.\n\nThe council man had more courage once the moment had passed its edge and become administratively solvable. He promised to look into procurement policies with a seriousness that made him look younger, and he took Maureen\u2019s pamphlet about what plants liked coffee and which ones preferred eggshells and said he would give it to his mother. The developer did a thing with his face that was intended to demonstrate magnanimity, and when Aunt Beryl offered him cake he said yes as if accepting charity he was above and then blushed when he realized he had given himself away. CHOICES dissolved into the crowd like sugar in tea and left behind a sweetness that made some people forget to be angry and others remember just in time. Mrs Ipswich reached down and stole a crumb in a way that made three small boys gasp and then giggle and then look around to see if they were supposed to pretend they had not seen a rat be graceful.\n\nThe best thing happened in the corner where the little tubs of finished compost sat like treasure in a museum. Children without prompting began to rub small smears on each other\u2019s wrists as if it were a festival with a ritual they had invented and not told adults about, and they gave each other roles in whispers that sounded very important. They decided that the dirt smell could be a shield against forgetting, and they named themselves Keepers of Filth with the kind of pride that makes a child impervious to mockery for a week. Kip did not interfere with their liturgy; he knew the difference between a game and a spell, and sometimes the game is better at sticking. He laughed deep in his ribs where laughter oils a hinge, and Rot-Right turned over content and took a nap with one ear open.\n\nLater, when the musician boys had finished their love song to compost and tried to segue to an unrelated ballad about a girl named Cass, and For The Love Of Worms had shouted into her hat that the raffle would happen in five minutes and that you could not put down two dollars and call yourself a worm farmer, and the sun slanted itself to make the You Yangs look like guarding dogs, Kip walked over to the fish and chip place at the corner and asked, in the language of men with aprons and burns, whether the trimmings from tonight\u2019s prep could be put into a black bucket and left by a certain grate for a rat queen with ethics. The man behind the counter had the face of someone who had known a lot of secret handshakes between oil and spice and who enjoyed complicated arrangements if they made something taste better. He agreed without making it dramatic, but he did ask if there would be anything in it for him, and Kip offered a discount on guilt that night and a bag of soil in a fortnight that would make his backyard coriander show off. They shook on it with a fishy palm and a hand that smelled like rosemary, and both men went away believing themselves clever.\n\nKip could have gone home then, the sort of home you make when your body knows how to curl itself under tea-tree and not be noticed by anyone with bad ideas. He didn\u2019t, because he had promised himself after the tunnel to take certain kinds of tiredness to water and certain kinds to stone. He followed the bay\u2019s edge until the promenade gave up and turned into ordinary path and then into bald honest earth, and he took the long way around so that he could feel the breath under him change at the places where old piers once had their feet. Tansy fell into step because he had been walking long enough for her to get bored of cleaning cake knives and because she liked the way people made way for her without knowing they were doing it. She had the hoodie up and her hands in the pocket and had not noticed that she had kept her high-vis on, which made her look like an occupational health and safety fairy on unpaid overtime.\n\n\u201cYou were good,\u201d she said, which for her meant she had been proud and had had to not smile where Maureen could see and think she was weak. \u201cYou didn\u2019t try to fix anyone\u2019s soul. You just let them put dirt up their nose and gave it a name that made them not hate themselves. I approve. You smell less like wrong now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had help,\u201d he said, meaning stone and iron and rats and aunties, and also that thing inside him that had sat down like a dog with manners. \u201cI wanted to call it a king again and then I remembered that kings are just men who have avoided being pushed in the mud, and I am not in the mood to flatter men today. The Anchor gave me a pin like a threat. It helps. Also the ring is itchy, which is good. It makes me remember that I am stupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why some people get tattoos,\u201d she said. \u201cSo they keep the moment of pain where they can read it instead of letting it fade into muscle memory. I\u2019m glad you put plastic on it too. The bracelet says you know the world likes to trick you into making the same joke twice in front of people who will never forgive you for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does say that in Comic Sans,\u201d he agreed solemnly, and they stood at the end of Cunningham Pier to watch a little girl swing her legs and repeat in a small private chant the names she had given herself and her friends, Keepers of Filth, Keepers of Filth, until the words skinned themselves of their obvious meanings and became a spell that would keep her from ever buying a bottle of something that claimed to make things go away without cost. Their city moved around them with the cheap grace of a man in a suit trying very hard not to trip on a step and pulling it off and then checking to see who had seen him not fall.\n\nThey went up to the You Yangs the following afternoon because the Anchor had sent a text that consisted of a hill emoji and a spanner and a skull, which in auntie talk meant bring your wrench and your common sense and be prepared to be told you were a clown. Alan drove because he had a ute and because his idea of a good time was bolting a problem to a solution with the wrong tool and then convincing both that they had chosen each other. Jet came with a notebook because her teacher had once told her that field notes were for grown-ups and she had never forgiven that implication. Mrs Ipswich refused a seat on the dashboard and instead rode in the tray with the joy of someone who had discovered that rat balance and a human vehicle made for a fine ride if you didn\u2019t mind the occasional bump that felt like a new idea.\n\nThe stone aunties met them by pretending not to be there. They let the city recede, and they brought birds in close, and the air had weight that anyone foolish would call oppressive and anyone sensible would feel in their ankles with gratitude. They did not step out of the rock because that would have made for a spectacle and the aunties did not perform for cousins. They made a particular sound instead, a clack like someone tapping a chain against a fence to call a dog home from the far side of mischief, and Kip stood still so that his skin could hear it and then moved forward with the caution of a man going into a room of women whose photographs stand on mantelpieces he is not in.\n\nThey told him what he knew and then they told him what he didn\u2019t. They told him his ring was ugly enough to be useful and the plastic bracelet was a good insult to the right people and that he should not give up that habit. They told him Rot-Right would sulk if ignored and hence should be fed like a cousin who has moved in unexpectedly, which is to say with respect and leftovers, and that if he had to choose between going under alone because a child was drowning and waiting for permission, he should bring the child up and apologize later to his elders for being built like a rescue. They told him not to give his new job to the council without ensuring that whoever took it had a grandmother who had dirt under her nails at least once. They told him there would be more of the solvent kind because someone had money for it and an idea of what clarity should smell like, and that the name of the man might begin with a letter that likes to lean.\n\nAlan wandered off and found a bolt that didn\u2019t belong to the hill and looked at it the way men looked at old photographs of themselves, and Jet wrote down the fact that when you sit on a particular rock, it presses the ache in your back into a shape that feels like a hand and that this is not terrifying if you have been loved before. Tansy listened with her hood up and knew that half the boys she had kissed would not have heard any of it and felt suddenly less lonely for it. Mrs Ipswich ran up and down a crack with the look of a creature inspecting property, considered the possibility of a holiday home in granite, and decided her people preferred bins with lids large enough to declare an ideology.\n\nWhen they came down, the bay\u2019s color had changed three times while they had been held, and Kip could feel the city\u2019s appetite for story pushing at him like a friend with an elbow. He did not go into a drain. He went to the fishmonger with his bucket that had acquired a designation it did not know it had desired, and he accepted trimmings with the respect owed to parts that had once been part of someone\u2019s supper in the making. He walked along the safe corridor after dark and set the bucket down like an offering, and Mrs Ipswich turned up with a committee and said a blessing in a language that had been invented that day and would be forgotten in the morning except by those who keep minutes where the feet go.\n\nRot-Right stood at his shoulder and sniffed and made polite eyes at the fish and then looked at him to make sure, because rules are like leashes, and you can love the hand that holds them or hate it. He pressed his hand to the grate and let the iron ring bruise him a little to give the yes weight. He said, not aloud, not whispered, just breathed the idea so that it fogged and cleared on its own, we feed, not frenzy. The taste of it came back as agreed, and he carried that agreement all the way up through his arm into the bed he made of ordinary and slept like a man who had done a day\u2019s work and would do another. He dreamed, inevitably, of worms with badges, of rats in hi-vis, of children reminding their parents to put orange peels in a bucket, and of a stone laughing so low that no one could be offended, only steadied, which is the kind of laugh that keeps a city together when it would prefer to get new shoes and run away.\n\nThe next week taught him that every ritual becomes a rota, which is how you know it is working and also how you know it will wear people down if you do not let it be funny. He put reminders in his phone with emojis he had to pretend to himself he did not find adorable; he let Alan bully a foreman into installing a proper grate on the west side by using the words liability exposure like a weapon; he took three calls from the council man who now referred to himself as a champion of urban composting in emails and only smiled a little with his teeth. He walked past the bath most mornings and touched the handrail with two fingers because the tiles liked that, and he could feel the different kind of clean that comes when someone has kept a promise to not remove but return. He held his iron ring when CHOICES left a flyer at Aunt Beryl\u2019s declaring that the council offered free consultations for people who found themselves obsessed with drains beyond a healthy concern, and he did not ring and he did not throw it away; he put it in the drawer with the batteries so that the next time he needed to power something, he would take out the flyer and laugh like a person who knows exactly where his weaknesses are because he has named them.\n\nHe and Tansy went under with Alan and Jet and sometimes Maureen and occasionally one of the older men from the garden who had been convinced that the drains were a place like a shed, with rules and handy shelves, and they took paint in buckets and wrote in places only rain could read, and the rain read and it did not forget. They scrubbed where the solvent kind sulked and made themselves a chore list that would have been depressing if it had not been broken into parts named after cakes. They learned the names of new rats because Mrs Ipswich had decided that municipal jobs came with performance reviews and gossip, and that if you wanted to move your family into a good pipe, you had to show you could take a joke about the time you ate an entire packet of jelly snakes and did not sleep for three days.\n\nOn the day he was due to talk to a room full of men who liked ties and counted their worth in carparks about the joys of rot, Kip put his hat on and then took it off and put his iron-and-plastic wrist between his teeth for a second the way people do to make themselves threaten to cry and then not. He thought about bringing the stone auntie to the meeting and laughed out loud at the picture of himself walking in with a boulder under his arm and breaking a shoe. He took his bucket of good dirt and his jar of live worms and the honest smell that makes suits pretend they cannot smell anything because they have to pretend they are above their noses, and he went to speak not as a boy apologizing for being clever but as a citizen inviting other citizens to put their hands in a future that would feed them. He did not plan his jokes because planning ruins them; he planned his silences and his spoon, and he decided that if anyone said Bio-Opportunity again, he would hand them a worm with the solemnity usually reserved for godchildren, and then he would stop because there are rules, and also because Aunt Beryl had promised to hex his ears if he refused to accept that sometimes charm is cruel when applied correctly.\n\nThe minute before he opened his mouth, he felt a rich current of sour-with-purpose slide along his ribs and nest in the hollow where his breath sits. Rot-Right had woken up for a speech. Kip did not bat it away or invite it to share the microphone. He sat it in the front row of his mind and told it to take notes, and when the men with ties laughed the second time, he let himself believe that they could learn something that would make the drains not a secret but a pride, and that belief felt like heat slipping into a cold room without being able to say its name.",

                              "content": "He did not open with a joke, though his mouth could have done it with his eyes closed and his hands occupied with worms. He opened with work, which is the safer cousin of charm. He tipped a small ribbon of coffee grounds into a clear box and then a layer of shredded paper that had once been council pamphlets and then a confetti of lettuce that had gone from crisp to sorry, and he did it like someone teaching sleep to a baby: unhurried, confident, ordinary magic that doesn\u2019t need clapping. He let his voice be warm without projecting, because power that doesn\u2019t strain often does more damage and more good, and he said the same small true thing three times in three ways so it could fit into different ears. Return is not rot being disgusting; return is gratitude in slow motion. Worms are stomachs and mouths and also citizens with a job to do. If you put in what they like, they will make you something you can run your hands through without thinking about what it used to be and without apologizing to anyone in your head.\n\nThey laughed first at each other, which is always a better sign than laughing at you. The man with the polish on his shoes let it be known that he could do humility by bending over and peering into the clear box as if it were a rare painting, and Kip kept his face soft and said something bland about ratios that did two jobs: it let the man talk to his own discomfort about dirt, and it reminded everyone else that there was a way to be smug about banana peels if you needed to be. A woman with neat hair and a badge that said Community Partnerships put her palm over the tub of finished compost like a fortune-teller and asked what she was supposed to see, and Kip put a handful into her hand without warning her properly because the best way to cut the ribbon on a new idea is to put it where skin is, and when she smiled despite herself, he felt Rot-Right stretch under his ribs like a dog who has been told it is allowed on the couch this once.\n\nThe developer stood with his body turned half towards the sea and half towards the crowd, as if he were on the verge of introducing them to each other and hoping not to be blamed if they didn\u2019t get along. He talked about systems. He said the word circular so many times it rolled off his tongue and became a wheel and tried to crush nuance under it, and when he said Bio-Opportunity Kip heard Aunt Beryl laugh in his memory and saw, out of the corner of his eye, Tansy take the measure of the man with one glance and shelf him under people who would refuse to use a mug twice if it had washed and dried between. The council liaison stood inside his own smile like a man wearing a wetsuit one size too small, and CHOICES drifted like a cool current in a room that had no water, the woman with the clipboard keeping just far enough away to not interact and close enough to be the shadow of a good idea.\n\nHe gave them a small trick because you have to feed audiences something sweet before you hand them vegetables. He showed them how to use a spoon to move worms gently without making themselves feel like murderers. He told the story of a boy who had brought his worm farm to school and watched with astonishment as the boy everyone thought was cruel stood for fourteen minutes without swatting a single fly and then went home and asked his mother if they could learn to make less. He did not say the boy was him; he put the boy into the room and let the men with ties wear him for a moment without liking how it fit, and he made them laugh at their own seriousness. When they laughed the second time, he let it be his invitation to say two things that might have sounded scolding if they hadn\u2019t been wrapped in dirt that smelled like cake: don\u2019t put citrus peels in until the system is older; don\u2019t call a thing clean because you can\u2019t smell it.\n\nWhen the questions came, they came with the particular tilt of heads that says we want your expertise inside our spreadsheet without you in the meeting where we allocate funds. How do you scale? Who holds risk? What will you do when the community loses interest? He answered like a person who had known what a ledger was since he could count and had always refused to let it decide whether a story was worth telling. You scale by multiplying small good habits and then doing what is necessary to make sure they are not punished. You hold risk the way you hold a jar full of sourdough starter: carefully, with a towel under in case of overflow, with respect for the exponential. Communities lose interest when they are not allowed to be funny; keep the humor in and the carrots tend themselves. Rot-Right paced once up and back under his heart as he said it, and he put his thumb against the iron and the plastic and the pin to keep the pacing from turning into a dash.\n\nAfterwards, when the worm-handling had devolved into a sort of low-key sacrament and Maureen had sold so many transparent boxes that she had started warning people against themselves, the developer made his move. He invited Kip to say soil with him in a little knot of men who kept looking over their shoulders at the bay like singled people at a wedding considering leaving early. He spoke about pilot programs and deliverables and thought he was doing Kip a favor by letting him see the engine room. Kip listened as if the words were rain and he was under a properly maintained verandah. He said thank you in the tone that means I understand that we have different jobs and mine isn\u2019t to be your conscience or your free marketing, and he smiled with his teeth under his lips, which is the way to smile when you want to remind a man that you have canine molars too and you just choose, most days, not to bite.\n\nCHOICES came in sideways, the clipboard held like a shield with rounded corners. She didn\u2019t introduce herself by any name that would stick; she introduced herself by service, which is a way of saying hello without being held to it later. We can help, she said without moving her mouth much, when the community begins to report\u2026 distortions. We have procedures. We can keep the brand clean. The word brand turned into a piece of plastic in Kip\u2019s mouth that his tongue could not push to the side, and for a moment he wanted to spit with a shocking lack of manners and see if anyone tried to ticket him. He didn\u2019t. He put his hand into the tub of compost again and then touched his own wrist where the skin was thinner and made dirt into a bracelet to match the LiveStrong and the iron. I don\u2019t want clean, he said with unembarrassed softness. I want honest. If you take away the complications I can work with, you leave me with a flat surface and a reflection. He thought she might break; she smiled instead and said, we are always here if you become overwhelmed by context, and the quiet threat of that sentence sat like a moth in his mouth until he breathed it out while bending to talk to a five-year-old about how worms cannot eat Lego.\n\nWhen it was done, when the teenagers had stopped playing long enough to find dignity in how much they had sweated and the council man had taken his mother\u2019s pamphlet and put it in his pocket like contraband because leaving it in his hand would have made it less likely to be read, he took his bucket and his hands and walked the perimeter to make sure everyone was leaving with ideas that weren\u2019t going to make Maureen swear later. Rot-Right hummed like a refrigerator does\u2014a constant small presence that becomes alarming only when it stops\u2014and when the hum shifted once to a higher pitch, he gave his neck a little twist and saw, the way you see water move under a breeze you didn\u2019t feel, the bin under the peppercorn where the solvent man had tried to make an idea. He found himself grateful that insult had been defeated in daylight and by vinegar. It suggested that the next move would be after dark and harder and that he should make sure his spectacles were clean, which is what Aunt Beryl calls the kind of thinking you put on when the obvious lies down.\n\nHe did not get to sit with that thought long enough to box it and label it for later because the sky did something deliberate. The bay is unashamed of weather; it lets its moods show. The breeze came up with fewer jokes in it. The light found a color it hadn\u2019t been wearing. On the fringe of the gardens, the peppercorn trees rubbed their scent together like anxious people warming their hands, and someone said in the comfortable tone of a man who has always distrusted forecasts and is now delighted to be a prophet, that\u2019ll be a storm then. Kip looked south and saw the line of dark coming like a teacher back to school after a strike, and he turned to the table nearest him and began the sort of sensible abrupt packing that saves cake and headphones and also pride.\n\nIt was not a storm that came to tidy. It was one that came to find where your house had been built poorly and tell everyone. The first drops hit the skin like a warning and then forgot themselves and became a slap; the smell on the air folded lemon in with wet wool. Maureen covered her worm tubs with practiced hands and called to two boys who had not yet learned to be embarrassed about sprinting to put the signs away, and the council man stood for a moment with his tie doing a small dance and then took it off with a look of a man who had been waiting years for the moment when he would tell his tie to behave and it would not. Tansy put Jet into a jacket that would have kept a seal pup smug and grabbed the cake box as if it were a small child which, in a town like this, it nearly was. Kip lifted the tub of finished compost like a baby and held onto his hat with the other hand and laughed because the world had decided to be interesting at an inconvenient time and there is a kink in him that loves that.\n\nHe was halfway to the shed when the first roar came up from the stormwater that belied the polite name. It said, I have been waiting in pipes and I will now speak, and people who have never listened to drains before heard it and looked towards the low places where footpaths become small creeks and then big ones. He thought of the writing they had put in places only rain could read, the letters that told water the old paths and asked it to take them. He put the tub down and put his hands on the nearest grate the way a person puts their palms on a friend\u2019s shoulders when they want to talk to them seriously, and he sent his voice down into the rush with the shapes that make directions without sounding like commands. The iron ring heated with friction he wasn\u2019t making with motion, and the pin the Anchor had set in his cuff burned a line against his kitchen-self until he wanted to wrestle it off and throw it in the bay and then go down after it and apologize.\n\nRot-Right woke fully, without yawning, and put its weight into the corners of him like a person bracing furniture before a door when someone knocks too hard. It wanted to take taste from what was coming up, and he did not forbid that, he redirected it the way you give a child a carrot when they ask for sugar. Not fear, he told it, not breath. Take the swill. Take the kitchen. Leave the ankles. It heard him because the iron made his voice sit heavy enough for it to take it seriously. Across the lawn, Alan had seen the same change and was already moving with the conviction that turns men into warnings; he ended up at the west side, where the weak bracket had finally given up on its responsibilities. He had the new one in his hand, not because he had expected exactly this moment, but because people like Alan carry the solution to two likely problems at all times and a willingness to lie about whether they knew they\u2019d need it.\n\nThe first surge over the curb brings glamour to places that don\u2019t often get it, and children briefly make sounds that make mothers draw in breath without scolding, but the second will take a foot if it can. The bath at Eastern Beach obeyed its own logic and slopped at the edges like a big bowl carrying too much soup. Una was there without being seen to arrive, her tattoos ready for a fight and her whistle in the key of attention cuts through rain, and she put rope in hands before the hands knew they wanted it. A line formed right of nothing and wrong became a plan, and people held each other as if holding were a job. Kip did not go to the bath; he went under. It would have been a story to say he forgot to bring anyone. He didn\u2019t. He lifted his hand to come and then dropped it because Tansy was shoving Jet into a safer place and Aunt Beryl was tying down a tent with a rope and Alan had his bracket and Maureen was busy seducing worms into staying home. He said out loud to the storm the two words that make the difference between arrogance and practice, coming back, and then he went down.\n\nThe drain had the voice of a thing happy to be what it was; under a storm, that voice can drown the bright bit of you if you haven\u2019t eaten enough, and Kip had, that day, in cake and praise and urgency. The rain read the letters they had painted the week before with a solemnity that made him want to hug Jet for naming it the silliest thing at the time, and the water took the old path where they had asked it to, which is to say that what had been a trick became a rule for a little while and that was enough. He made his light small so he wouldn\u2019t see everything and put his palm on the tunnel wall and let his breath match the rush and then the long, and when the tug came at his ankles that said you could go now and be a story of someone we say an elegant thing about, he pressed the iron to his teeth and concentrated on terrible small truths like the names of his toes and the fact that he had left the kettle on a thousand times and never burned the house and that Aunt Beryl had once let a cake fall and had sworn at it with affection.\n\nThe smell that came wasn\u2019t Rot\u2019s. It was the other one, the removal one, and it came bright, clean, false, as if someone had put a lemon in their mouth and told you they had tasted the sea. It came with the sound a hospital makes at two in the morning when everything is fine and then you think about it and nothing is fine. It didn\u2019t want to eat; it wanted to dissolve. It wanted to make the boundaries go away so that nothing had to be counted and no one had to look at the smear and say I did that. It smelled like the word pristine when it has been put on a brochure with a picture of water that has forgotten it is made of time. Kip felt Rot-Right flinch, not because it was afraid, but because it knew an insult when it met one. He pulled it back by the scruff in his mind and set it to the edges as if this were a pastry that needed to stop its leak. The solvent smell slid past his nose and tried to hide inside his sense of relief and he thought, with uncharacteristic clarity, no, you are not a kindness, and named it for himself in the privacy of his head: Away.\n\nIt didn\u2019t like that. It did not live in names; it lived in the spaces between words where responsibility fades out because everyone is tired. It poured itself towards him with the intent of a hand with a cloth and he held up his iron like it could be more than metaphor and it was, for the length of a breath, enough. It hissed against the ring as if you could make a sound with an idea when you don\u2019t have teeth, and he made himself heavy as stone. He thought of the aunties who had put a rock in the worm pile and how the whole coil of heat there had sat down like sense finally heard, and he made that weight inside himself on purpose in a way he had never had to do before so that he would not become a light thing that can be carried off.\n\nThe rain found his back and made him into slope and culvert, and if he had not heard Alan\u2019s particular cursing from the mouth of the drain a long way off he might have let the arms of the water carry him three inches and then six and then he would have had to be clever in a way that is not compatible with keeping your own breath. He fixed his feet. He made his light a little bigger not for himself but for the thing that wanted to see where it could be useful and he said, not to Rot-Right and not to Away and not to the storm but to the brick and the old flow and the smell of tallow that the place had not yet given up, remember your job. The brick did, because brick is reliable when you don\u2019t ask it to do more than hold. The old flow remembered the river. The tallow remembered fat that had fed people who had cried when they thought about being dammed, and that sadness, being honest, made the remove-idea jump back as if it had put a hand on something hot by mistake.\n\nHe found the smear that had not dissolved the week before because it had not been asked to; it glowed in his small light with the satisfaction of a stain that has been given attention and thinks it means it will be kept. He put his hand very near it without touching because there are ways to be intimate with horror that do not involve bodily fluids, and he pushed the thought at it that Aunt Beryl has taught him to use when a person shows up with a casserole that is mostly guilt and wants to be thanked. Not here. We are busy. Take your story somewhere else. It did not go because he had told it so; it went because the rain reading their letters made the tunnel into a throat that wasn\u2019t interested in being burned and chose a different gulp.\n\nWhen he came up, the world had more edges in it. The air made needles of itself against his cheeks and he laughed, not out of bravery but as if he had almost fallen off a bike and for a second had thought of the blood and then had not bled and your body insists on celebrating the absence. Una was a shape in the slanting rain, her strong hands holding rope, the rope holding people, the people holding each other. Tansy stood with her hoodie stuck to her skull like kelp and her eyes narrow and her mouth old and kind and mean, which is to say she was doing the work of being clever while tired. Jet had a whistle and was not using it, which is proof that children can be saints when their hands are full. Alan stood with one knee in a puddle and a bracket installed so cleanly that an inspector would have wept, and he had the particular rigor mortis of men who have been right at the exact right time and are now ridiculous about it.\n\nThe meltdown after a storm is always a little stupid. Everyone wants to tell their small version of heroism to the nearest person with a face and the people with faces don\u2019t want to hear it yet. They stood under a bit of tin that had not been asked to shelter more than one person at once for twenty years and shared heat like mammals. Aunt Beryl took a rollcall without pretending she wasn\u2019t doing it and then handed out cake from the box she had saved like a contraband rosary, and because humans are very easily led, the act of putting something sweet into a wet mouth convicted them of survival and told their bodies to calm down. The council man looked at his hands as if they had done something he had not budgeted for and then shook his head once and went to get more rope because he had learned something he didn\u2019t know where to put and the easiest place was back into his hands, and CHOICES stood with the kind of posture that says we can help anyone who will sign this form in the rain.\n\nKip found he was shivering not because cold but because everything had put away its edges too quickly and his body had nowhere to put the spare. He put his iron against his face and let it be colder than he was, and when he went to find Aunt Beryl because he needed the kind of telling off that feels like you are being wrapped in a towel, he walked into the Anchor instead and thought, briefly and idiotically, that perhaps he had become her, because there is a moment when you meet your anchor and your shape relaxes around it with the inevitability of a bag of flour finding the shape of its jar. She stood with rain-line hair and needles sticking out of a ball of knitting like weaponry and eyes like safe places, and she did not make a joke about how he smelled, though she could have. She nodded once and put a wet hand on his wet cheek and said, which is to say pronounced, because some words are court orders in their softness, that will come again not because you failed but because it is made of people. He wanted to argue for the luxury of blame and could not because she did not leave space for indignity.\n\nHe told her about Away without using the name he had thought in his head, because sometimes names work two ways and he had no reason to send a calling card. He told her about the hiss at the iron and the way it had slid into his sense of relief like a thief in a convenience store pretending to be staff. She frowned with satisfaction because being right is also a job when you are old and she had been hoping he would see it. The aunties said don\u2019t name that one yet, she said as if it had been said on a piece of wind and lodged in her shawl. Make a box and write do not open until you have a broom big enough to hit it with. In the meantime, do what you have been doing, which is tie rules to everything that will accept a knot. Teach your dog to sit in rooms full of meat without embarrassing you. Feed it. Don\u2019t let it eat people\u2019s small shocks. And when the men with solvent come with clipboards, send them to me. I have a tone of voice that makes a foreman lie down with a headache.\n\nHe did as he was told not because he is obedient generally but because he has chosen his queens with care. The storm ran out of drama and sat down, and the light did that thing the bay\u2019s light does after it has been showing off, where it settles into the work of making shape and line visible. They walked home without stories, which is one of the best ways to walk in a town like this; it leaves the air uncluttered for the next thing. He slept hard and not sensible, too tired to be political with his own dreams, and woke with the taste of metal and rosemary in his mouth, which he decided to take as a benediction in Aunt Beryl\u2019s dialect.\n\nJet\u2019s school carnival landed in the middle of the week like a boisterous aunt sitting on an arm of the couch not meant to hold a person. Kip went because he liked the way school events turned the day into a festival and because Jet had said, casually in a tone carefully oiled to not beg, that it would be good if someone who could pull a girl out of a water with laughter stood near the shallow end. He put on a big shirt that made him look like an uninteresting adult and wore his iron like it was jewelry because sometimes you need to train the part of you that wants to vanish into behaving like a person. It wasn\u2019t magical, the day; it was ordinary in a way that heals. He bought a sausage in bread from a father who had not wanted to grill and had done it anyway because masculinity is a chore, and he put sunscreen on a child who was not his, and he clapped for learners who came last and did not cry, and he felt Rot-Right sit and watch and obey the rule about children because rules are habits if you feed them.\n\nHe did one small stupid thing because he is not a saint. A man in sunglasses with a voice that had been taught by talk radio said something about the smell at the shallow end in a tone like a suggestion of court and then laughed when his friend flinched at the taste of pre-boiled water, and Kip, who has empathy in muscle but not always perfect impulse control, flicked the air by the man\u2019s ear with a finger until the smell of dirt crept into his nostril and made him smile against his will. The man laughed wrong and then right, and it was petty and it was not noble, and there are few pleasures so clean. Tansy saw him do it and waited until after to kick his ankle, not to hurt but to mark. He nodded and said sorry you\u2019re right out loud in front of the kiosk because there are some apologies that should be witnessed so they can\u2019t be retracted later in memory, and she patted his shoulder roughly as if shoving him into his better self.\n\nThe solvent men did not rest, and neither did the part of the city that aligns itself with clean lines without context. The day after the storm, a boy in a high-vis vest who had the look of someone who had been told good news and then discovered the fine print found a box left under the west bridge with a label that had had a label peeled off. Alan opened it with the care you give a bomb or a wedding invitation, depending on your temperament, and found six bottles with translucent liquid that smelled of virtue and hospital floors. There was no official logo, but the glass bore the ghost of an old brand, and the lid had a scratch shaped like an L, which might have been nothing and might have been the letter that likes to lean. Kip took one in his hand and his stomach clenched like you have when you see a dog going to run across a busy road and you are too far away to make a difference, and he looked at the boy who had found it and saw in him that terrible thing cities do to young men where they become proud of their proximity to danger. He took the pride away gently by putting trouble in his own pocket and replacing it with a job that had a title that sounded important: liaison.\n\nIt is satisfying to discover that your enemy has a logo. It makes you believe in the shape of the fight. Kip did not give himself this. He put the bottle in Aunt Beryl\u2019s kitchen because kitchens can transfigure villains into ingredients when you are careful, and he stood there with his hands empty like someone demonstrating contrition to a god he has chosen and said, we need to know how it works before it isn\u2019t allowed to. Aunt Beryl, who had in her time put lye and vinegar within an inch of each other and taught them to behave or be separated indefinitely, sniffed at the top and pinched her face in a way that had once made men in aprons leave knives on benches. She poured a drop\u2014not into the sink, which would have been a conversation with a drain that did not need more gossip, but onto a plate that had once been a roof tile and had been kept for occasions where you wouldn\u2019t be sad if you melted your crockery. The drop sat on the tile and made a noise so soft you only heard it if you liked secrets, and then it did what it was built for, which is take away, and it took away the memory of what had been on the tile before and left behind a scratch.\n\nThey learned its rules the way you learn the rules of a sad dog you are determined to love because he is family. It did not eat fat properly; it spread it thinner, like shame. It did not like salt unless given sweetness first. It made paper look like it could not possibly have held words. It turned certain plastics lively in a way that made Tansy swear and put all the Easter tubs on top of the fridge to be dealt with when the council had made up its mind to buy a fire. It did not understand how to be kind about flesh; it could be persuaded to leave alone what had learned to be skin at the expense of other possibilities, but it required loud talk and iron and the steady hand of someone who could put their faith in the fact of edges. You could teach it, in small. You could not trust it in distance.\n\nThey sat with the You Yang aunties again without needing to drive, which is to say the aunties came down into the air and the feel of granite settled into the day like a smell you associate with someone you love. Stone doesn\u2019t talk about chemicals; it talks about what they want to do. The aunties said, as if remarking on weather in a tone that was still a warning, that the one that removes will try to become a law. It will try to persuade men who have never opened a jar of preserves in their lives that they have always wanted air they don\u2019t have to breathe. It will wear words like clear and crisp and pure, and people will nod because they are tired of being animals. They said you cannot fight a slogan with three paragraphs. You have to give a different word to the same feeling and make it stick when the body is under strain. They said you name it Away in your own head and you call what you love Near out loud until children repeat it in playgrounds and it becomes rude to say anything else.\n\nHe named the near things. He named them in small places where men with neat hair could not ask for a copy of the minutes. He told Jet that when she swam she was putting her body into Near and that if she felt a sleek come to roll under her and make her think she wanted to stand on a tile and leave, she should call that a trick and not a wish. He told Mrs Ipswich that the corridor of pipe that ran from Maureen\u2019s worm fairyland to the river was Near and that if she met anything there that made her whiskers stiffen like she wanted to sneeze, she should slap its idea of itself and make a scandal, because scandal is Near\u2019s way of keeping people honest. He told Tansy that his mouth was Near when she kissed him, which he said as a joke and then wasn\u2019t, and she thumped his shoulder without hitting his iron and said don\u2019t flirt with me when I\u2019m on shift because I will either ignore you or marry you out of spite.\n\nA week after worm day, the developer held a walk-through along the water with men and women who say phrases like activation and place-making without being ashamed that anyone can hear them. He brought his son, which is always the most dangerous kind of camouflage because sons will not do the decent thing and stand where their fathers put them; they go to the places where the smell is most interesting. Kip was not invited but he is nearly impossible to uninvite from his own city, and he took a clipboard from CHOICES without asking because it is harder for people to make you leave if you look like you belong to the bureaucracy. He walked three steps behind the group and put his ear down every now and then to listen to a bolt or a bracket so Alan would feel included, and when the son made his inevitable move towards the lip of a drain that was trying to have a conversation with the storm that had left, Kip met him halfway with the silly hat and said come look at a rat corridor instead, you\u2019ll see something better than a dead thing.\n\nIt was Mrs Ipswich\u2019s time to make trouble elegant. She had stationed her younger girls along the corridor with a sense of theatre and a sign in chalk that said RATS ONLY and then smaller underneath you can watch if you don\u2019t touch and then smaller underneath with a drawing of a hand with a red cross through it because sometimes you have to be patronising. The boy put his face against the grate the way children put their faces against windows, and the rats obligingly did rat things that make children honest, like washing their hands with their own little paws vigorously enough that anyone prejudiced against them is forced to admit they are not beholden to stereotypes. The boy laughed with the sound of a family\u2019s money falling off his shoulders for half a minute, and the developer\u2019s face did an unreadable thing and then settled into something we might kindly call surprise. CHOICES drifted forward with a pamphlet that promised to remove any unpleasant images from your child\u2019s long-term memory for a small fee, and the son said without irony, as if he had spent his life rehearsing to be useful, I want to remember this, and Kip felt savage affection for him the way you feel for a kitten that has accidentally clawed the face of a man who needed it.\n\nThe solvent men made their mistake that evening, which is to say they made their inevitability early and this is useful for stories. They poured their clean into a place they thought no one would see\u2014an underpass near the old woolstores where the air had acquired a memory of bodies and where the walls were layered with graffiti that had been clever and then been painted over by the city and then pressed back under in newer colours that had not yet learned to hold. It should have gone away, the paint, under solvent\u2019s hand; that is the promise removal makes. It did not, because the people who had made the jokes in colour had also made them in shape, and rain had read them and water remembers when asked. What the solvent did was pull the pigment into a wetness, and then because it was too proud to trickle, it slid and pooled and made a slick that reflected faces in a way that made you believe you would forget yours and then discover you had not.\n\nThey went with brooms and buckets and vinegar again because this is a city that knows how to repeat the useful processes until someone builds a ritual out of them. They went with a stone from the aunties because the You Yangs like to put their weight where it will be felt, and they set the stone down where the solvent had made a gleam and told the gleam to be tired. Maureen came with a kid who had been making microscopic friends in a jar since she was four and now had a tray of bacteria that could eat things it shouldn\u2019t have known the names of, and she poured them with reverence and a disgust that was part of her piety. Alan brought a bracket just in case and ended up using it for nothing, which is the purest joy of a prepared man. Jet brought a whistle and this time blew it because she wanted to see if the tone would make the gleam forget itself, and it did, a little, because sound has mass if you aim it right.\n\nKip did not name the solvent thing aloud. He told it what it could not have\u2014not children, not courage, not bold colours that had been jokes about politicians and hearts and lovemaking on picnic tables\u2014and he fed Rot-Right a diet as carefully curated as an oncologist\u2019s protocol: old fat, coffee, leaves, the honorable end of lettuce. He said Near to everything with edges until he was annoying even to himself, and then he said it again and made it funny so that people could copy it without feeling like they were signing a treaty. The CHOICES woman stood in the half light with a clipboard she did not write on and looked as if she wanted to say we can fix this and then remembered the rule someone had taught her once about not promising what you can\u2019t do in front of press. The council man showed up with a truck and four teenagers in vests and a painter\u2019s mask and said tell me where to stand and did not make a speech about consultation, and Kip turned his face sideways so the man wouldn\u2019t see how much he liked him at that moment because he did not want to add to anyone\u2019s burdens with his own gratitude.\n\nHe slept hard after that because people do. He woke in the middle of the night because cats fight at two and three and the city has never liked to do anything privately. He sat up without sitting up and felt under his rib the curious sensation of being sung to by something with no throat. It did not feel like Rot-Right; it didn\u2019t feel like Away; it felt like water laughed sideways through a pipe. He went to the window and saw nothing but the black of weather to come, and then on the sill he saw two marks like lines made by a child who cannot yet be trusted with pen and wall. They were in salt, which is the You Yangs\u2019 handwriting when they can\u2019t be bothered with granite, and the lines were this shape: a plumb bob and a hook.\n\nThe aunties were, in their way, interested in his promise not to go under alone. They had sent a counterweight and a way to steal. A plumb is not fancy; it is a string with a weight at the end that points only in one direction. A hook is a hook. He took the message into his pocket and lay down and did not pretend that he would not fail his promise at some point when breath was at stake. He made instead the smaller vow that he would fail it cleanly and tell on himself quickly and wear whatever iron he was given without sulking in front of children. The idea that he couldn\u2019t save everyone had become in the last few weeks less like a spear and more like a spoon; it was still sharp, but he had learned to eat with it.\n\nMorning broke like something made of sugar and starch; it held together because everyone was too tired to poke it before coffee. He was at Aunt Beryl\u2019s before she had five minutes to be offended by his hair, and he cleaned the stove with a cloth no one would miss while she pretended she needed his help and then let him steal a handful of the ends of a cake that had been trimmed to look square for a man who thought geometry could be tasted. The iron itched like thought. The plastic bracelet caught the cuff of his shirt and made him swear in a way that would have offended the man who had invented it in a different decade, and Aunt Beryl looked at his wrist and sniffed again and then kissed her teeth at him like a cat making an opinion. You\u2019re getting good at this, she said as if she meant something else as well, and he considered the interesting possibility of being good at not being special and found himself suspicious of how much he liked it.\n\nHe saw the developer again that day because cities are loops and men who want to build have to walk the same rocks as men who want to keep. The man had a small dog with comedic eyebrows that announced his wife had a sense of humor and that he was trying to borrow it. He talked about setbacks as if he were rehearsing for a panel and said the phrase reputational risk with a long enough vowel that Kip could have threaded it on a string. Kip said I am happy to help if help means making a mess in daylight that we then clean up together, and the man looked at him as if he had spoken Latin and then barked with laughter because the dog had farted at exactly the moment when language did not work. It is rude and true that what you need to make citizens out of consumers is often an embarrassing noise and a bag.\n\nThe afternoon brought small chores: convincing a butcher to save bones in a separate bin because the rats had opinions about marrow; having an argument with a teenager with a skateboard about whether the gold paint that said you are loved looked better in italics or bold; talking to a woman whose son had decided he wanted to be a plumber because drains are chatty and being decent about her fears of trades; telling Maureen that no, not all coffee shops will give you their grounds if you stare at them hard, you need to smile and promise to mention them on a signboard and then do it twice. He did each thing with the same attention he would have given to saving a child, which is how you make a town that doesn\u2019t resent being lectured at, and every time he wanted to be clever merely for the pleasure of feeling the edges of it he put his fingers under the iron until the itch put him back into a body.\n\nWhen night laid itself down on the city like a reasonable blanket and people gave themselves permission to be smaller in a room with a door, he took the plumb bob and the hook to the bridge because not doing so would have ached worse than the iron. He did not tell anyone because nobody answers their phone at ten without a question that hurts, and he did not go under alone because he had learned that if you go under alone, you have to keep your first promise every ten seconds like a religious chant and you forget to listen. He texted Alan a photo of the plumb with a spanner emoji and a skull, which was their agreed-upon code for I\u2019m doing a thing and it has bones in it and if I don\u2019t text again in ten minutes you may break things in my defense. Alan responded immediately with a picture of a bolt and a heart and then the letter L in a font that leaned and Kip laughed and went.\n\nIt was different in the after of a storm and a near miss. The tunnels held their breath in the way of beasts resting on elbows, and the smell of Away hung thin as if it had been told to go sit in the corner and think about what it had done. He hung the plumb bob from a pipe and didn\u2019t think about the fact that he was loitering in a place that had no use for the word loiter. The string knew what it wanted; it found down like a dog finds the boy it lives with in a crowd. He held the hook in his left hand like a thief. When you steal from water you don\u2019t take, you borrow and put back, and you have to be braver than clever, and he is just enough of both.\n\nThe plumb settled over a place that looked like every other place and wasn\u2019t. The air there clicked against his teeth like a battery, and the concrete had a stain shaped not by accident but by design, and the design was a logo he had seen without understanding it, and now he did, and for a fragile, delicious, dangerous moment he felt the joy of patterns collapsing into a picture. The L tilted just so, the scratch on the bottle lid magnified to a graffiti. He put his hook under the seam of thought where the solvent men had pried time open and he lifted like you lift a scab when you know it will bleed and are gross and honest enough to do it anyway, and the panel of space that had been thin turned over like a flap on an Advent calendar, and behind it there was not chocolate.\n\nThere was a room. He stood in a tunnel and opened not a door; he tilted a thing one degree and then two and found himself looking through air at a space that had decided to capture itself. It wasn\u2019t big in the way architects think of big; it was large the way a lie is large. It held shelving and boxes and those bottles he would have recognized if he were blind and the smell of clean cut with the smell of old meat like alms, and it held a table with a long scratch in the shape of a letter that leaned, and it held two men doing the thing men do when they have convinced themselves they are above consequence: they were laughing at something that hadn\u2019t happened yet as if their laughter would cause its happening to be harmless. He didn\u2019t think hero; he thought oh for god\u2019s sake, because irritation is often the premier fuel for bravery.\n\nHe could have gone back for help and made the story polite. He could have taken a photograph and sent it to Aunt Beryl who would have known the name of the cousin of the man who owns the warehouse and can make permits evaporate with a phone call. He might yet do both. But he had a hook and a plumb and iron on his wrist and a habit of getting into trouble when the door is open just enough for a thin boy to slip through. He lifted the flap of air like a curtain and stepped in.\n\nIt smelled like mouthwash and lies. He did not let it tell him his nose was wrong. He saw the men turn as if they had heard a door, and perhaps they had, because honesty changes pressure. He put his hand out, palm open, and said the sentence that makes people reveal what they didn\u2019t plan to, I\u2019m so glad I caught you, and they moved like decent citizens who have been momentarily mistaken for villains, which is to say they tried to hide their hands without looking like they were hiding them. He laughed like a bully\u2019s friend and it put them at ease because men like this don\u2019t expect a boy who smells like drains to be in on a joke. He walked past them and took a bottle off the shelf and put it under his nose and pretended to admire it, and in doing so he put his iron wrist in front of his mouth so that whatever wanted to come in would have to argue with an ugly ring first.\n\nHe did not hurt them. He wanted to. He wanted to do the stupid good man thing of crushing hands with a broom handle and saying the word community as if it were a weapon. He didn\u2019t because his job is not to be king of bins with a cudgel; it is to make patterns that hold. He said instead in an unthreatening voice, this isn\u2019t going to work, and he let the hook do the work. He slid it under their pride and pulled, and the room tilted. The shelves did not fall; that would have been dramatic and unhelpful. The smell wavered. The ghost of the label on the bottle he held fluttered like a dollar bill in front of a fan, and the idea that they could do this unseen moved sideways, which is often all a lie needs to stop being able to stand.\n\nThey blustered. Of course they did. There are scripts for men like this, written into the city like chalk on old brick. They said the council, they said regulation, they said trial, they said necessary, they said early adopter, they said pilot. He repeated after them as if learning a language and pronounced their words wrong on purpose so that little laughter grew shoots out of his mouth and the room became unsafe for the straight, clean lines a brochure loves. He looked at the scratch on the table and let himself be arrogant one second because sometimes the only way to frustrate a man who leans is to lean harder and not fall, and he put his finger on the scar and said in a voice that should have been someone older\u2019s, you don\u2019t get to call it clean if we have to forget to love it.\n\nHe left. He took two bottles because he is a thief when theft is a grace and because evidence is a thing that has to be placed on a table in front of men with ties before they will move their heavy hands. He resealed the room without a verb and stood in the familiar wet throat of the city and wanted very much to sit down and cry because it would have been the simplest thing, and instead he texted Alan the word hooks and then the letter L and then a picture of his own iron because he needed to tell the truth to someone who would not make a theory out of it. Alan wrote back a single sentence that was beautiful because it came from a man whose love letter to bolts had never written him in before: I have a friend in Fire who hates solvents on religious grounds, and Kip laughed out loud in a place rain collects and then pressed his forehead to the wall and did nothing clever for thirty breaths because sometimes that is the only way to not be a story you cannot sustain.\n\nHe did bring Aunt Beryl the bottles and she did not kiss him or curse him; she put them in a cupboard that had a lock and then she put a bowl of stew in front of him and made him eat and then drink water before she told him that his face had gotten a little worse and that suited him. He went to the Anchor and she said nothing and then spoke a word that felt like a weight, and it helped, as weights do. He slept with the iron ring above his head like he was the kind of person who would put a child\u2019s teeth under a pillow and not be caught by mice, and he dreamt not of drains or solvents or rats in hi-vis but of a field somewhere not near the sea where worms can live without needing to be heroes and thought, as he woke, that he would need to take a train soon and talk to a farmer who had never thought of Geelong as a place where his work might matter.\n\nMorning came with bagpipes in his phone because the universe does not let jokes rest if they are serviceable, and it was the council man, bright as new rope, saying he had a room and chairs and more men than was strictly necessary and would Kip bring his buckets and his dirt. He put the plumb and the hook in his pocket and kissed Aunt Beryl on the cheek without getting hexed for it and put on his hat and went to be a version of himself that made people think they had had the idea first. Rot-Right made itself tall in him without being proud, which is the only way to be safe and useful at once, and the Anchor\u2019s pin scratched his cuff and told him to stand up straighter, and he thought, not without amusement, that the city had decided he would be a boy with a job whether he liked it or not and that he did, which was the real sorcery.\n\nThe room was air-conditioned into forgetfulness and carpeted into a kind of compliance that makes people behave as if their shoes matter when they don\u2019t. The men in ties were there, and two women who had the faces of people always put at the end of the table and never asked first, and a man with a Fire emblem on his chest who looked like the sort of person Alan would call when he needed solvents to regret their life choices. The bottles he had stolen sat on the table under a tea towel, domestic and obscene at once, and the council man\u2019s jaw was set in the way of a man who has decided which side he will be embarrassed on and it will not be the one that smells like lemon without lemons.\n\nHe did his dirt trick and made them smell memory instead of theory. He took the tea towel off the bottles and made the room flinch and didn\u2019t apologize for the rudeness of daylight on things that prefer shadow. He said Near when he meant policy and laughed when he needed them to breathe and held up the iron ring when he said the words don\u2019t go down alone. He watched the CHOICES woman in the corner with her pen unmoving and saw, for the first time, not a functionary but a person with a mother who had once told her to be brave and had meant something she had not done for a while. He made his case not as a cape-wearing city saviour but as a boy who would like to be held to account by people who can sign checks and wash up after themselves. The Fire man spoke about how solvents change the air and how the air is a thing you are not allowed to ruin because the rest of us own it, and the council man said a sentence that had the word moratorium in it and looked ashamed of the size of it, and a woman at the end of the table said what if we did something good that makes us look like we meant to all along and it felt like a prayer said correctly on the first try.\n\nWhen Kip left, he wasn\u2019t sure if he had won anything that could be put in an envelope, but he had the sense of something heavy having been placed on a side that had needed it. He walked out into a day that had the decency to be ordinary, and he felt his ring itch without malice and his plastic bracelet catch on the world in ways that kept him anchored, and he watched a gull steal a chip and decide not to eat it and bring it back to a small boy because the boy had clapped the gull for being clever and the gull had remembered that even thieves are susceptible to praise. He laughed and took that as a good omen because he likes to take as many of those as there are, and then he went to the bridge and sat with his feet on a grate and put his hand down to where Near lives and he hummed, a tune without words, a job without grandeur, a kindness that stinks and is therefore worth more than anything wrapped in cellophane.",
