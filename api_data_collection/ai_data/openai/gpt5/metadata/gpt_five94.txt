When the tram braked down the slope to the river he could tell, by sound alone, that the city had decided to be patient today. The squeal was lower, more like a sigh than a cry. Marek stood at the joint between carriages where the rubber folds in and out like lungs and watched the rails curve across the bridge, the Vltava below as flat and gray as solder. He had a hand on the vertical bar and another tucked inside his coat where he felt the printout pressing his chest—the email. The offer. A distant land that wasn’t just a brochure word anymore but a place stitched with his name.

An older woman elbowed him, politely, apologetically, as the tram rocked. “Pardon,” she said, then under her breath, “Always so many today,” as if days were a species.

He smiled. “It’s all right,” he said, and then, because it made him feel less like a silent object in transit, he added, “I get off soon.”

The doors opened with their too-cheery chime at Staroměstská. The smell of coffee, chestnuts, damp coats. Marek stepped down, boots sliding on a thin seam of melted snow watered into the platform, and walked toward a street where the buildings leaned together and kept secrets for each other. His phone buzzed against his ribs. He knew who it was before he looked. He took it out anyway. Boss.

“Where are you?” Radan’s voice crackled with speed. The man could turn a greeting into a deadline.

“Old Town,” Marek said. “You said the tenement on Bílkova had… ghosts.”

Radan grunted. “Not ghosts. A shoemaker on the second floor has an oven drawing too much, the third-floor lady says her lights sing. Find the junction, fix it, get to the theater on Vodičkova by four. And—wait. Did you get my email?”

Marek glanced at the folded paper in his coat. He put his shoulder against the cold wall beside a newsstand. “Yes,” he said.

“Good. We can talk later,” Radan said, which meant not good. Marek slipped the phone back, felt the paper again, and climbed the dark stone stairs of the tenement where names on the mailboxes were a cross-section of years: Hanyšová, Král, Coss, now someone had printed a name on masking tape and it was curling off.

The shoe repairman smelled of glue and old conversations. He wore an apron that had outlived several perfect suits. “Electrician?” he asked, and Marek nodded. The man gestured with a shoe sole. “The oven’s not the problem. My wife says the television blinks when it’s quiet.”

“Televisions are nervous creatures,” Marek said, and the man barked a laugh.

Marek unscrewed the metal plate from a junction box in the landing. He liked this part. How the screws were small and stubborn and then not, the plate coming away like a lid on a box where light hummed. He liked the sense that a thing has reasons and a shape, that burnt insulation smells not like failure but like a story.

A thread of improper wiring, a neutral where a live should be. He caught it with pliers, reseated, wrapped, tightened. And all the while the city outside like a transistor on low; he heard it through stone and plaster, the tram announcements, someone arguing lightly about apples.

“You are young,” the shoemaker said, standing too close, eyes bright. “You do this long time?”

“Long enough,” Marek said.

The shoemaker nodded, then lowered his voice as if there were other electricians at the door, waiting to challenge. “I heard… we pay you not enough in this country. My cousin went to Düsseldorf. Comes back twice a year, drinks too much, leaves money on the table. My wife says he’s unhappy. But he looks fat.”

Marek snugged the last connector and flipped the breaker back on. The stairwell light woke up. “Fat can be a disguise,” he said, and did not explain.

Outside, the air was less like a blade than a spoon. He walked past tourists clustered around an animated guide who swung a yellow umbrella like a metronome and crossed a square where a man with a red scarf juggled while speaking English that made a bridge between here and somewhere else. Marek avoided his eyes because he did not know, yet, if he wanted such bridges or to knock them down.

The theater on Vodičkova was not beautiful from the back, which is where electricians spend their time. Stage hands with scarred hands and quick smiles nodded at him. “Green room,” someone said, “the sockets sulk.” Marek crouched behind a faded velvet sofa and pulled a face he thought nobody saw but someone did.

“Do sockets jump out and bite?” asked a voice. It belonged to a woman with a thermos and hair the color of coffee before milk.

“They do if you call them names,” he said without looking up. “If you say they’re lazy, they spark.”

“I would never,” she said. There was a quiet in how she stood that raised a sheet of air between her and the rest of the people in the room. “You’re Marek, right?”

He looked over his shoulder, surprised. He didn’t wear a name tag. “Yes.”

“My cousin tours with the lighting crew. He told me about you. You climbed into the ceiling of the National Theater when the sound failed mid-aria and whispered to the wires and they obeyed.”

Marek snorted. “I swore at them, mostly,” he said. “Wires respond to conviction.”

She laughed and it made her whole face look like a solved problem. “I’m Ema,” she said, and then, as if her name were something too simple to carry her, “I live near you. Karoliny Světlé, the building with the lost cat posters.”

“Žižkov,” he said. “Me too.” He remembered, then: a woman in the stairwell, the same quiet, the same coffee hair, pushing her post into the mailbox with a fingertip as if it were music.

“How is it living above the violin repairman?” she asked.

“Shrill afternoons,” he said. “But at night it’s like the house is breathing.” He tightened the last screw. The socket settled, obedient. Ema held out her thermos cap like a prize. He shook his head. “No, thanks. I better keep my hands steady.”

She glanced at his hands as if to read that. “I could use…” She touched her throat, then laughed. “No. Sorry. It’s nothing.” She used English for the last word, and it sounded foreign enough that she smiled at it.

“You could use what?” he asked, and when she hesitated he added, softer, “We can keep secrets from the sockets.”

“I’m singing on… a television thing,” she said. “Not like the big ones. But they came to our street to tape… you know… life. I don’t like microphones that crackle. It makes my heart crackle too. If you had a look at my little pre-amp—I’d pay you in soup.”

He shrugged. “I like soup.” He liked that she stumbled and then recovered in the same sentence. “I’ll stop by tonight.”

She nodded and the quiet around her loosened a little, and people began to notice her again. Marek finished up and left before someone could ask him to make a brand-new stage from dust and wish.

Around six he waved to the barman at the corner pub who waved back with his eyes only and put a beer aside for when Marek would return later or not, depending on whether the day took him down a different street. He climbed the stairs of his building and smelled cabbage, someone’s perfume, old wood. On the second landing, a notice: On Friday the water will be off from 9 to 13. Below, someone had written a question mark and then under that someone else had drawn a fish.

Ema’s door was open a crack, which in this building meant an invitation or a threat. He knocked lightly. “Come in,” she called, and he eased in, removing his boots without being asked.

Her flat was the shape of a sigh—long, narrow, comforting. A plant in the window looked like it had been coaxed into believing in sunshine. A cat watched him from the radiator with an expression that said it knew exactly how he would behave. On the table, a microphone. And the kind of small amplifier he liked because it told you what it was without coyness.

“I made soup,” Ema said from the tiny kitchen. “It isn’t beautiful but it says hello.”

“That’s all soup needs to say,” he answered. He touched the cable, the plug. He could tell by how it resisted that there was rot inside the jack. He unscrewed the casing. He could almost do it with his eyes closed, but he kept them open because Ema was in the corner of his vision, stirring something that smelled like dill and childhood.

“You speak English,” she said when the soup was ladled. “Your mouth is careful with it.”

“I learn it when I cannot sleep,” he said. “It keeps the brain busy so it doesn’t speak."

“You plan to go somewhere?” Her voice did not pretend not to know.

He hesitated and it left a space that only truth could fill. “New Zealand,” he said, and the word made the room tug toward some horizon he could not yet see. “I have a friend who knows a man who installs solar farms. They need hands that don’t shake.”

“Does your hand shake?” Ema asked gently.

“Sometimes,” he said. “Only when nobody’s looking.”

She blew on a spoonful of soup, watching the steam like prophecy. “You will find quiet there,” she said, though he hadn’t asked. “Or you will find a quiet inside that travels with you. Or maybe you find a storm you needed to learn.”

He smiled. “People think when I say New Zealand I want to be a surfer. I want to wire barn roofs. I want to stand in a wind not made by buses.”

They ate in a soft clatter. The cat blinked. On Ema’s fridge a magnet said, in English, TUESDAY IS A LIAR. He asked about it and she shrugged. “A friend gave it to me. She said it sounded wise in another language.”

“Do you sing in English?” he asked. He was trying to keep the words like birds in a garden rather than wind in a canyon.

“Sometimes,” she said. “If the song refuses to be Czech. The producers say we will do one segment where we sing in a language that is not our own. It’s supposed to be humanizing.” She rolled her eyes. “They called it: Global Voices, Local Hearts.”

He fixed the jack with a new solder bead that gleamed like a promise, then reassembled the plug, feeling that clicking satisfaction of threads aligning. He was good at this. He knew it as surely as he knew the way a shadow lengthens across a kitchen floor. He had not always been sure what good meant in the larger sentence of his life.

“You should hear me tomorrow,” she said suddenly, as if speech were walking and it had turned down an alley on impulse. “If you want. They’re filming outside the pastry shop. There will be too many cameras. I’m afraid of the wrong things.”

He looked at her. “I am too,” he said.

On his way back down, he met his neighbor across from the mailboxes, the one with the conspiracy about the garbage chute. “Always open,” Karel said, poking the chute like a sleeping animal. “The draft is stealing warmth from us. They do not care.” He gestured upward, to management, the universe, whoever.

“Close it,” Marek said. “Use a chair.”

“They will say the chair violates the fire code,” Karel said, triumphant already. “And then we lose twice.”

Marek squeezed by, smiling, and slipped into his flat where wires coiled like sleeping snakes on the table and the map of the world over his bed had a red pin stuck somewhere down and right. He sat with the email.

Marek,

I asked around. The boss here is a German with a Czech mother. He presses both palms when he shakes, you’ll like that. He says if you can make old houses breathe with new lights you can make a field of panels sing. He can get you a work visa if you prove existence (photos, certificates, whatever that bureaucracy loves). It’s not glamorous. We drive a lot. We eat pies that smell like mince and apologies. But the sky, Marek. It’s like somebody forgot to make a ceiling.

Come. Or at least come for a while. You can leave if you hate it. You can brag if you love it.

– Radim

Marek found himself laughing at the word pies. He imagined holding a pie and not knowing how many apologies it contained. He closed his eyes. It didn’t solve anything. He was a man in a small flat who could fix a jack in the neighboring flat and a stage outlet downtown and many things in between. He was also a man who could pack a suitcase. The sugar bowl on his table was chipped. He lifted it anyway, as if it were a trophy.

In the morning he went to see his mother because you don’t pack simply; you check your roots to see what you will tear when you pull. She lived across the river in a block that had been a block for longer than anyone in it. The elevator allowed only two people and only if they each held their breath. He climbed the stairs instead and knocked in the rhythm of childhood.

“Jsi to ty?” she called, as if it could be a thief who politely knocked in that rhythm to capture her. He stepped in and the smell of onions and polish wrapped him. The living room had doilies that had never had a day off. On the television a man in a suit was shouting at another man in a suit without moving his mouth.

“You should fix that,” he said, nodding at the screen. “Their arguments would be more honest if their mouths kept up.”

His mother waved a hand. “I mute it anyway,” she said. “Their hands are the truth.”

He kissed her cheek, the air light as he approached it. “Ma.”

“Are you hungry?” She asked it like a test of his character. He said yes because it was easier and because he could tell the soup pot had to justify itself too.

She ladled and he sat, and then she looked at him as if he were something she had meant to put in the freezer weeks ago and had found behind the bread. “Your boss called,” she said. “He said you might be thinking to leave.” Radan did that. He climbed every ladder in a building.

Marek put his spoon down. “He asked if I took my old drill. He calls it his.” He tried a smile. It was the wrong key. “I’m thinking, yes.”

“Thinking,” she repeated, and rolled the word in her mouth like a cherry pit. “Where?”

“New Zealand.”

She said it as if tasting a curd cheese cake somebody had made overnight. “Far. Farther than far.”

“Yes.”

“And for what? Electricity? There are wires here, Mareček.”

“There are also people who remind you you were always the boy who dropped the pan in the kitchen and made the soup fly.” It came out before he could stop it. He saw it hit her and wanted to take it back, the words like birds that did not recognize the window.

She placed her spoon with the kind of care people reserve for fragile bones. “You were not always that boy,” she said. “Sometimes you were the boy who brought the apples home without bruises.” Her hand touched his as if testing if he was real. “Who will bring mine when you are gone?”

He had thought about this, because he was decent. He had planned routes for errands. He had thought that his sister in Brno would send money on good months and letters on bad. He had calculated eyes and hands. Still the question folded the table in half and set it right again. “I can come back,” he said. “And you are not alone. Katerina will… listen.”

“Listen. Hm.” She looked beyond him to the window where steam had given up being steam and become droplets. “Your father would have said—” She stopped. He knew what. He heard it anyway.

“Your father would have said,” he said gently, “that leaving is an insult to the ones who stay. He would have said men belong where they were born unless war takes them.”

“War takes in many ways,” she said, surprising him. “He would not have understood you, but that was not always your fault.”

They ate. She had a way of turning corners and finding a chair in a new room. He told her about Ema in a way that made it sound like a weather report. His mother lifted her brows just once. “A singer,” she said. “They never live on the second floor. They live on stairways.”

As he got up to leave, she touched his sleeve and said, “If you go, do not become someone else to deserve it.”

On the street he walked faster than he should, as if motion could outrun the sentence that had just walked into his chest and sat there. He stopped at the butcher where, when he was eight, he had once asked for a pound of summer. The butcher had not laughed.

Back in his own neighborhood, the pub door was open and he could see Kuba, already leaning over the table with his elbows too sharp for the varnish. Kuba was the kind of friend who made his loyalty look like a dare.

“You come to confess,” Kuba said when he saw him. “Sit. Drink. Be less dramatic.”

“I’m thinking of leaving,” Marek said. He didn’t put sugar around it. Kuba squinted, then grinned.

“To Ostrava?” he asked. “It would be a change. They say the air is now clear of the souls of miners, but you never know.”

“Farther.”

“How far is farther?” He leaned back, arms out.

“New Zealand.”

Kuba slapped the table so hard the glasses jumped. “That is not a distance, that is an excuse,” he said, but his eyes were kind. “To go around the world to escape what? Our beautiful winter? Your boss’s voice? My jokes?”

Marek smiled. “Maybe I’m going toward something. Not away.”

Kuba raised his beer. “Better,” he said. “Say that. Even if it is a lie. Maybe it becomes true. That is how my aunt’s marriage happened.”

“I wrote to Radim,” Marek said. “He found a thing. It is real. It is not a balloon.”

Kuba looked into his beer as if reading fish there. “I will miss you,” he said, suddenly serious, then shook his head and swore in a way that turned the air warm. “I hate that sentence. It makes me sound like an old woman. When do you leave?”

“I have to apply. It takes months. They want proofs. I am a man with a toolbox and they want a stack of certificates.”

“So take your toolbox to the embassy,” Kuba said. “Wire them light. Make them love you.” He looked around their pub where the walls were a yellow that could only be achieved by years of smoke and people and spill. “You know this will always be here. Or mostly. The barman will get fat. The art on the wall will be replaced with other art that says the same thing. If you go, you do not betray bricks. Only maybe one or two people. But we forgive you. As long as you bring weird candy when you come back.”

“Weird candy,” Marek repeated, and that felt like a promise he could keep.

On his way out, he nearly bumped into Hana—the girl he’d been with for a while, the kind of while that sets crockery and rhythm but not forever. She had a scarf that knew how to snake around in a way that made people stare. “Marek,” she said, and her lips made the outline of his name like a puzzle piece. “I heard.”

“Who told you?” he asked, though he already knew: the city. It had ears. It was made out of them.

“Everyone,” she said. “Radan. Karel. Your mother yelling not-yelling on the phone.” She set one hand on her hip and one on the air. “So. You weren’t happy with me, that’s fine. You weren’t happy with you, that’s not my job. You think you’ll be happy in a place where the sheep outnumber people?”

He didn’t bite. He didn’t want to have that conversation in front of the wall where someone had scratched a heart and the initial H into the paint twelve years ago. “I am trying to be brave enough not to deserve my own blessings,” he said, which probably sounded like an insult to anyone who didn’t live inside his head.

She blinked. “What?”

“Never mind.” He sighed and felt older and younger at the same time. “I will write.”

“That letter will smell of wind and beer and you will use words like mate,” she said. “Go. Or don’t. But stop dangling.”

He nodded. When he stepped back into the cold, he wanted to put his hands in his pockets but they were full of the evening. So he walked with them open, not touching anything but sometimes catching ghost snow.

Late. Home. He opened the email again because it was like a window you couldn’t resist staring out because the view might change if you stared long enough. He began gathering papers. Certificates. Receipts. Photos of installations he’d done—wires in galleries, patient and exact; a light fixture in a lobby of an apartment building that had made a grandmother cry because it was the shape of the flower her husband had given her when they married; a row of old sockets replaced with new that still looked old because aesthetics matter, even to electrons.

It was at that point that he realized he didn’t have a diploma that said university anything. He had a stubborn apprenticeship and a stack of recommendations written in cyber-age fonts by men with calluses. He had a book he had kept since he was nineteen where he drew the path of wires through spaces like sketching veins. He held that book in his hands and felt it beating.

He wrote to Radim in the language of the internet, filling in forms with answers that felt like prayers. He wrote to his boss. A letter on postcard paper because he didn’t own plain paper, only things that promised. He wrote:

Radan,

I am applying for the visa. This is not because I hate this city or this job. It is because my blood is noisy. I will finish the theater and the office at Smíchov and Karel’s chalet that isn’t a chalet. I will leave my notes. If you need me after, write. If I mess up and come back, pretend I never left so I can pretend I never failed.

– M.

He slipped it under the office door the next morning and thought of Radan’s face folding into something like disappointment because when Radan had fed him a sandwich years ago and told him he was good at this, it had been true love of a kind.

The city gathered itself into a narrower gray. Clouds hung so low even pigeons walked. Marek bought coffee from a kiosk where the woman always whispered a joke when she handed over the change. Today’s was: “Never trust a man who irons his socks.” He laughed because it pulled him back into a human shape.

At lunchtime he met Ema outside the pastry shop. The cameras looked innocent, small things with red lights like marbles, but the crew behind walked around as if gravity worked harder for them. Ema stood without coat, in a red dress that was not a color so much as a promise to eyes. She waved when she saw him and in the wave he saw terror and a little joy, both.

“You came,” she said, voice carrying without help. “Now I will fail less.”

“You won’t fail,” he said. Then, because he was aware of the universe’s taste for humility, “If you do, it will be elegant.” He stepped back against a lamppost. People gathered, drawn by the organ-grinder that cameras are for the human heart.

A producer with hair that tried to leave his head in every direction clapped his hands. “Okay! Ema! We do the stroll, the laugh, the real talk, the song—small part only—we save the big for the studio. You will pretend to be surprised when the street piano appears.”

Ema looked at the street. “There is no piano.”

“That’s why it will be surprising when it appears!” He nodded as if that solved the physics of it.

They did it. Marek watched her walk, head up, eyes not too sure, and he felt the way people already knew how to love her because she was not trying to make their love easy. He watched the piano appear, pushed by two men with arms like rivers. He watched her sit and place her fingers in a way that was not trained but true, and when she sang it was not the song that was beautiful but the way the street changed shape to hear it. Even the tram seemed to lower its volume like a person who wanted to be inside something he didn’t cleanly understand.

After, his phone buzzed. Radan. He let it ring and then stopped and then ring again and then he answered because not answering makes its own weather.

“Coward,” Radan said, not meaning it entirely. “You sneak letters under doors like a lover who owes money.”

“I thought you weren’t in,” Marek said, watching Ema laughing with the camera man whose name he didn’t know and the pastry lady who would become a national aunt for three minutes.

“Of course I’m in,” Radan said. “I live between the kettle and the fuse box. So. New Zealand. Well. The theater wants dimmer packs installed in a way that doesn’t set them on fire when the soprano hits C. We need you for a month at least. After that… if you go, take the drills that are yours and half the ones that are mine. I will curse you, and then I will brag about you to the new boys.”

Marek leaned his head against the cold metal of the lamppost. “Thanks,” he said, because it was the kind of thanks that is not a word but a position of the heart.

“And Marek,” Radan said, quieter. “You do not have to become a new man to deserve a new sky.”

“You too,” Marek said, because he could only bear to say the thing if he gave it away as an echo.

He hung up and saw that Ema was waving him over. The camera caught him half-resistant. He found himself being introduced to the nation as Ema’s neighbor, the one who fixes coffee makers and calms lights.

“He’s shy,” Ema said, into the red eye. “He does not know his face is a city map.”

“Say something,” the producer said, and pushed a microphone toward his teeth.

Marek said the first truth that didn’t involve his mother or letters. “She sings like a building being renovated without losing its history,” he said. The camera guy made a sound that felt like a laugh got lost and then found itself.

That night, after the filming, after a quick beer where even the barman smiled at him as if he had grown a centimeter on screen, after Ema thanked him with another bowl and a promise to bring him cake that would break his English in the mouth, after he walked through streets that seemed to be practicing being remembered, he slept. It was not a deep sleep but it was one that brought him into a room where his father sat at a table with a hammer and a piece of wood, making something that would hold something else. In the dream his father looked up and said, “This is what a man does. He makes a shape that helps other shapes not fall.” Marek wanted to tell him about watts and ohms and New Zealand and how you can build a roof of panels that drink light, but the dream did not accept the explanation and instead the hammer rang like a thin bell.

In the morning, he wrote again, this time to himself, on the first page of the old wire book: A distant place is not a promise. It’s a room you haven’t swept yet. Bring your broom. Bring your hands that want to.

Work that day was a tangle—somehow every apartment he entered had a lamp that looked like a question mark. People were kinder suddenly, or he noticed kindness because he was walking the edges of a decision. On a lunch break he sat on the embankment and watched a man teach his dog to be brave around ducks. There were words that would never translate some days.

He thought of Ema’s voice traveling through cables, the way a song is trapped and then freed in the living rooms of people who didn’t know her. He thought of how she’d said “I am afraid of the wrong things,” and how she’d moved anyway. He thought about the visa form with its squares like empty rooms. He thought about his mother’s hands. He thought about the shoemaker saying fat is a disguise. He thought about the producer’s hair and the piano and the way the city could be filmed into a narrative.

On his way home, for no reason he could later justify, he stopped at the shop with the maps in the window. He stood looking at framed rectangles of the world, the kind of pale blue that implied geography had been tamed by representation, which it never has. The woman behind the counter said, “You can’t buy a new place to put your old self,” in a way that implied she had sold many maps.

“I need a small one,” he said. “Something I can fold until it remembers my pocket.”

He left with a globe the size of an apple. He put it on his table next to the sugar bowl and watched as it refused to reveal secrets. He spun it once, lightly, and it was dumb to feel that if it stopped on the right spot it would approve or refuse him. It stopped on the Pacific, blue as a sentence that could end in a thousand ways.

In the hallway, he heard Ema humming. She did that like people who write letters to themselves. He leaned in the doorframe, with his knuckles, not wanting to knock. She caught him and waved him in. “I made cake,” she announced, triumphant and apologetic. “It is… dense.”

“I like dense,” he said, and he meant it. Some days you need to chew.

They ate it at her table and did not talk about the cameras or the way her face had flashed on a hundred phones already. She asked him to teach her a sentence in English that was not about weather or apologies. He thought for a moment, then wrote on a napkin: You do not have to be the loudest part to be heard.

She whispered it, again, then smiled. “That sounds like a lyric I would be embarrassed to love,” she said, but he could tell she would carry it in her pocket.

At his own door, later, he paused, and then without thinking he took the globe from his table and set it in the hallway, on the shelf where people leave things for other people to borrow—the community library of objects. Someone put a book there once and it went to five flats and never came back but became gossip. He put the globe there and taped next to it a scrap that said, in his hand, Where would you go if you could go and still be you?

In the morning, it was gone. What a relief. Or what a theft. He laughed and felt the city laugh with him in a small, dry way.

The first letter he received in response to the visa forms said: Additional documentation requested. He swore in the boiler room of the theater where he was installing the new dimmers. He swore at bureaucracy, at the way an official can pretend you are not a story but a stack of squares. Radan stuck his head in. “You can swear tomorrow,” he said. “Now, the mezzanine light spills onto the soprano and she hates to be seen entirely.” He grinned.

Marek worked. He worked until his fingers knew they were valuable. He walked to his mother’s on Thursday and brought apples in a bag that bruised anyway. He made a joke of it and she smiled like someone catching a glass that was as breakable as it looked. He fixed her tea kettle and she said it whistled in a nicer key now.

And on Friday, when he and Ema met again in the stairwell because the water was off and everyone had to guard what was left in their kettles like treasure, she said, shy and not, “They will air the segment next week. They said I didn’t drool on my vowels.”

He snorted. “I will watch.”

“No,” she said. “Come. I will watch it with you. So that when I cover my eyes you can tell me if people throw things. So that when they don’t, you can say, See? It was only a camera.”

He said yes, and then she reached out and touched his sleeve in the same way his mother had, only different. The city breathed in. He imagined that on the other side of the world a field of panels tilted slightly and made a sound he could not hear yet.

That evening he took down his old drill. He had written his name on the side in marker years ago and it had faded into anonymity. He sharpened bits. He wiped the handle. He tested the cord. Wires are wires anywhere. Sky is sky. But the angle at which a man stands under them can change and that, he realized, was partly the point. He had been waiting to be approved, stamped, measured. He lifted the drill and felt the weight of his own hands. Maybe the thing to be was not new but honest. Maybe he could go far and not be a person who always felt far.

He turned off the lights except one, the one in the corner that always hummed faintly in a way he often resented but tonight did not. He listened. The hum was like the city’s low patience. He put the email under the light and read it again and then not at all. He went to bed and slept like someone who had been seen and could not unsay it.

On Sunday, he met Radim on a video call. The connection turned them into mosaics. “Mate,” Radim said, grin wide, the word like an inside joke they had not yet earned. “Send the new papers. The boss here liked the photos. He said, ‘At least the man has hands.’ He said it as if it was not common.”

“I have hands,” Marek said, holding them toward the camera like proof. They were nicked and clean. “Tell him I also have… patience.”

“Do not sell him patience,” Radim said. “They want speed. Sell him an eye. And bring your stubbornness, you’ll need to explain why the wind is not a switch.”

After that, the days went into each other like gears. Marek rode trams, fixed sockets, left notes, wrote lists, and sometimes stood in the stairwell to see who would touch the globe next. Once, a child left a sticker of a star on the shelf. Once, someone left a postcard from a place that was not New Zealand and yet was far enough to be useful.

Then the evening came. The one where the pastry shop gathered into itself around a television. Ema had arranged it in a way that looked unarranged: chairs, two tables dragged together, a string of fairy lights that the pastry lady pretended to hate and then repositioned herself with surprising thoroughness. Marek sat against the wall, as if the wall needed him.

As the national logo swam across the screen, there were the usual jokes. When the theme song played, a boy at the back plucked the right notes on a guitar and felt like he had conjured the music. Then there she was. Ema, walking between cars and cakes, her face made into a story. People clapped because the television had told them to and because they wanted to. When she sang, it was, again, like she had negotiated with the air and made a treaty it could respect.

Marek watched her watching herself. There is a particular way a person does that. She flinched when the camera caught her laughing. She smiled when the street piano appeared. She put her face in her hands and then peered through fingers when the producer cut to her eyes in a way that made the audience feel like thieves sharing her privacy with permission.

When the segment was over, the pastry shop was noisy. Strangers leaned into her space with sweets and congratulations. The pastry lady pretended to be important and was. Someone shoved a microphone near Ema’s face again and she said, too fast, “I had help.” She gestured toward him and for a second Marek regretted oxygen. He stood because sitting felt like hiding and nodded at nobody. The camera caught his winter face and softened it.

“Neighbor,” the commentator said, in a tone that made the word sound like a country.

After, on the street, as the night folded down and headlights painted brief rooms on the facades, Ema leaned against the poster case outside. Marek stood beside her and looked at the word pastry reversed on the glass.

“You were good,” he said.

“I was me,” she answered. “And they did not edit me into someone who would apologize for the way she held her shoulders.” She took a breath. “You will go,” she said, not a question.

“I will try,” he said. “I will send new squares.”

“And if the squares return to you and say no?”

“I will re-measure,” he said. “I will stay for a while and watch the city make sense in new ways.”

She nodded. “Either way, you are not what the visa says.” She caught his sleeve again, because that was how she told the truth. “You are not what the television says. You are the man who makes my microphone decide to be brave.”

He almost said something grand. He said instead, “You can keep the jack. Consider it a talisman.”

She laughed. “I will clip it to my belt and startle the fashion people.”

They stood for a while and counted taxis. Then he walked home through the street where the shoemaker lived. The light in the stairwell did not hum. The oven in the shoemaker’s shop was a square red glow. He could see the shoemaker’s wife, watching television with her head slightly tilted, as if to understand more through a change of angle. He thought of his mother, probably in her chair, and imagined her “hm” that she used to make both scold and bless. He thought of Radan at the kettle, grumbling with love. He thought, of course, of Radim on the other side of the world where it was morning and birds felt like new inventions.

In his flat, he did not turn on the overhead. He set the apple globe on his palm and lifted it to the window, letting the city’s average light spill over it. He stood like that for a while, like someone balancing a weight and a question. Then he set it down and undressed and lay in bed with the awareness that the world goes on whether he places a pin in it or not.

He slept. The hum under the house, the big, patient city hum, slowed. He dreamed of ladders that did not lean against anything but still held. He woke with the feeling that the floor had tilted toward somewhere. He sat up and laughed because that simply meant he’d slept on a book again.

He got up, made coffee, burned his tongue on eagerness, looked at the forms. Picked up a pen. Wrote his own name as if someone else would read it and find it persuasive. Outside, the tram sighed. Somewhere a piano existed that had been wheeled out into the day. The day looked back at him like a hallway he had walked a thousand times and hadn’t mapped yet.

He put on his coat and went to work. He walked quickly because he had not learned how to walk slowly when he was carrying a decision. And in the doorway of the building he paused and touched the shelf where the globe had stood and where now someone had left a small shell, streaked cream and brown, and a note that said, in a child’s misshapen letters, I would go to the sea and then home.

Marek smiled. He tucked the shell into his pocket because some things you hold. He stepped into the street and the day took him like a hand.In the morning, the shell weighs more than its size explains. Marek keeps turning it in his pocket until the ridges make a pattern on his palm he can feel even through the lining. Outside the glass door of his building the day has been ironed flat by a gray so thorough it could count as an honest effort. He walks toward the tram and watches the old woman who sweeps the corner by the kiosk whether she is paid to or not. She always lifts the broom and pauses to listen to pigeons as if they are giving instructions. Today she looks up at him and says, “You look like a man who is carrying something you did not buy.”

“A shell,” he says, because sometimes truth is easier than a polite lie, and her eyebrows go up like awnings.

“From someone who has already been to the sea,” she says. “Those are the ones that give direction.”

The tram is crowded with people who have discovered their winter coats still have the imprints of last year’s receipts in them. He stands near the door and rests his hand on the vertical bar like a man swearing on a book. A boy with a knitted hat that makes his head look like a small planet offers him a sunflower seed as if they are fellow watchers of a slow parade. Marek declines with a smile. Near Narodni, a field of umbrellas opens and moves as a single organism, rain breaking into statements over the city. When he gets off, the pavement makes a noise under his boots like a discussion no one quite wants to have.

The embassy is a building that pretends not to be important by being smaller than the street thinks it should be. Inside, there is a machine that gives numbers and the machine has the cheerful tyranny of a game. He presses the button labeled General Inquiries and it rewards him with E78. The room is full of people inventing new ways to sit. A man in a suit writes on his knee, a woman with three children speaks four languages at once in a tone that bends time into compliance, an old man sleeps without apology, his mouth open toward the ceiling as if practicing for amazement. Marek sits next to a radiator that’s putting in an honest day’s work, and his number climbs a digital ladder so slowly he thinks of moss.

At E68 a young woman with a stack of photocopies so straight it could be a model of a building sits down beside him. Her hair is the color of coffee when it has resigned itself to milk. She looks at his empty hands, at his anxious foot, then at the screen. “They never call the eights fast,” she says, as if this is a rule known to those who live in visa rooms.

“Maybe they have a superstition,” he says. “Or maybe the eight looks like an infinity and scares them.”

“I’m Jana,” she says, because in rooms like this names make chairs softer. “Where are you trying to go?”

“New Zealand,” he answers, and he feels, again, the horizon tug the air.

She smiles with half her mouth. “I went to Ireland for nine months and came back with a cat. It took more paperwork to bring in the cat than to bring back me. They made me swear the cat would respect Irish culture when she was here and Czech culture when she returned. She has failed at both and is unrepentant.”

He laughs and is grateful for the way humor dislodges worry like a teaspoon tapping a jar. When E78 blinks on, the clerk behind the glass is a woman with hair pinned into a bun so efficient it could run for office. Her name tag says Šárka. She does not look up as she speaks and her voice has the cadence of someone who has learned to say the same explanation in a hundred ways without going mad.

“For the Skilled Worker Visa,” she says, “you must submit proof of qualifications recognized by the relevant authorities, proof of work experience, letters from employers, a contract, police certificates not older than six months, medical checks from approved clinics, translations by an authorized translator, photographs size 35 by 45 millimeters, not smiling, not with glasses, with ears visible.”

“I am not sure I can promise visible ears,” he says, and she looks up then with a quick smile that suggests she rewards people who threaten the template gently.

“You can promise to try,” she says. “Additionally, because your profession involves regulated practices, we require registration with an equivalent body, or a letter from the employer explaining why registration is not required. Your references must include role specifics. Please include a CV condensed to two pages. Do not send us your autobiography,” she adds, and for a moment it is as if she has seen his notebooks, his drawings of wires like muscles.

“I have no university,” he says softly. “I have papers from an apprenticeship. I have a license here. I have work you can touch if you get on a tram and ride to Karlin.”

“An absence is a type of presence if you explain it,” she replies, and the words are unexpectedly kind. “Write it simply. Do not argue with paper. Paper is a child that needs simple sentences.”

He leaves the embassy with a list on which the checkboxes look like windows in a building he will have to climb. The rain has decided to fall in committees, not consistently but with the kind of rhythm that makes you distrust patterns. He ducks into a translation office where a clock in the shape of a parrot ticks like it is pecking minutes. The translator, a man with hands too clean, tells him how much words weigh when they cross borders. He pays and leaves with the sensation of having purchased time.

At the theater, dimmers yawn at him like unadmitted sins. He takes off his coat, hangs it on a squeaking hook, and wades into the problem of light. The mezzanine throws a slice of color onto a set that is not currently a set but will be, a city street in a city that does not exist but feels familiar because the lamps along it cast their glow at the right angle. Stagehands wave with their chins. A soprano in a knit cap tests a note and it climbs up to the dome with the kind of confidence that could either save or ruin an evening. Marek opens a panel and hears the hum he has come to treat like weather: sometimes you work in rain.

He kneels beside a rack and forgets the embassy for almost six minutes. It is the kind of forgetting that doesn’t erase but pauses. He likes the smell of warm dust because it tells him where warmth has been and where it might go. Luka, the lighting chief with a jaw that could split wood, crouches beside him like a mirror in heavier boots. “If you go,” Luka says, because word spreads through this building like music when a door opens, “who will I yell at when these packs decide romance is more interesting than function?”

“Yell at function,” Marek says. “It can take it.”

Luka grunts. “Come to the pub after rehearsal,” he says, then hesitates as if the sentence has more to carry. “Ema will be there. The director pretending not to watch her will be there. It will be a good night to see what you would miss.”

He spends the afternoon bending wires into good behavior and trying to forget that everything now is a form of inventory. At six he stands with his coat open to the damp, watching the street between the theater and the pub. Ema arrives with hair slightly damp and a scarf that looks like it has been invented for this exact day. She smiles and he feels it like light under a door. In the pub, the tables are full and the air sits low with the talk of people who have practiced tonight’s lines and tomorrow’s worries. The director is a narrow man whose hands are always choreographing a smaller play above the table. When he sees Ema, he adopts a fatherly regard that convinces nobody. He orders her a drink that she does not drink because her throat is a machine that she knows how to treat gently.

Marek lets the others compete for the loudest story and sits opposite Ema, not speaking a secret but not avoiding one. She asks about the embassy with the kind of interest people keep when they are not yet mixed up in your consequences, and he tells her about Šárka and her commandment about ears. Ema laughs, then her face does the thing it sometimes does where a brief cloud crosses. “My father applied to leave when I was seven,” she says into the half-circle of her glass. “Not to New Zealand. To Canada. He said the same word your mouth says when you say field. He said it was a place where you could see weather coming early. The papers did not say yes. He stayed and believed he had been asked to be a martyr. He made a religion from a process.”

“Does he…?” Marek starts, and she shakes her head.

“He manages a warehouse. He marries women who believe he is an idea. I learned to not sing in kitchens so as not to break their plates.”

Marek hears this and does not reach for pity because pity is a habit you can learn that ruins your hands. He tells her about his father’s belief in staying and how a hammer held every principle at once. They sit, not symmetric but companionable, and it is the closest he has come to telling anyone that the word far is not always distance.

After a while, Luka insists they come see the new fog machine, which he calls The Cloudmaker in a tone of awe and suspicion. In the side room, Marek helps coax a plug into courtesy and the machine sends out a white exhale that makes people doubt their definition of space. In the fog, someone kisses someone else who is not their partner and laughs. Ema leans close to be heard and says, “Tomorrow I go to an old church to sing with a friend. The roof leaks, and the priest says that makes the faith more accurate. Come and listen. It will be a rehearsal for something I don’t have yet.”

He goes because the word church in her mouth does not mean what it does in his mother’s, and because he likes the way the day fills when you say yes to two things instead of one. The church is small and has a patient smell. With no microphones, the air needs no help. Ema stands where the floorboards dip and sings a song in English she has borrowed from an American who once lived here long enough to understand how to pretend not to be seen, and the way Ema bends the vowels makes it hers. Her friend plays a harmonium that wheezes like an asthmatic guardian, and the combination pries open a feeling in the room that the statue of a saint in the corner seems to approve of with chipped serenity.

After, they drink tea from cups that have a line where the liquid always stops. Ema tells him she will have to go to Brno for a weekend to see an aunt with a too-fluent heart, and he says he will have to go anyway to find the man who taught him to bend wire without bruising it. “Oldřich,” he says, and the name falls into the teacup with a little ripple. “He kept his tools wrapped in a cloth like children being carried. He wrote on the back of cigarette packets so as not to waste good paper on things that did not yet prove themselves true.”

They choose a train in their heads and then different trains in practice because life would be too much if you aligned with other people accidentally. Marek goes on a Friday, a bag with three shirts and the shell in the pocket because he doesn’t yet know if the sea belongs in Moravia. The train is almost empty and smells like old coffee even before the trolley appears to make the smell official. He sits by the window and watches the country rearrange itself into fields and trees that remind him of stubbornness. Somewhere after Pardubice, the man across the aisle starts to snore, and the sound fits so neatly into the rhythm of the carriage that Marek almost falls asleep to it.

In Brno, the station is a mouth that has learned to pronounce change. The square outside has a clock whose joke is too pleased with itself, and a busker playing something that promises jazz and then betrays it. Marek walks to his sister’s flat where the front door still sticks in the same place and you have to say please to it with your hip. Katerina opens with her daughter clinging to her skirt like useful gravity. The child looks at him with the solemnity reserved for those who carry bags and therefore could be magicians.

“Uncle medic,” she says because names are malleable and she has decided electrician is too long, and he submits to the promotion.

Katerina feeds him with that generosity she uses to cover her capacity for fury. “You come to take Ma’s duty from me?” she asks, not entirely joking, and he lets the question sit on the table beside the salt until they both decide to share it. They talk about the city like it is a cousin misbehaving in predictable ways. The child insists on showing him her drawing of a house with a door in the roof because that’s where you escape when the floor becomes lava. He pockets the detail as if it will become metaphor later.

Oldřich’s workshop is three tram stops away and a turn behind a bakery that refuses to admit it is not Paris. The bell on the door is a coin someone forgot to spend. Inside, it is indecently tidy. The boards on the wall hold tools like a prayer would if you could hammer it into shape. Oldřich himself looks exactly as he did and nothing like it, thinner by one story, hair like tin that has refused to shine, eyes as sharp and as kind as a small blade used for careful work.

“You finally have the nerve to get paid somewhere else,” he says by way of greeting, and hugs him in a way that makes his ribs consider their options. “Of course I heard. Radan tells me everything he doesn’t tell himself. Sit. Eat. You look like the train washed you.”

Marek tells him about the letter he needs and feels that the boy he used to be is sitting on the stool by the wall craning to hear the grown men talk. Oldřich nods and shakes his pen to warn it to behave. He writes, and the scratch of his pen sounds like the sewing of a wound. When he reads it out loud, it is not poetry but it is specific, and specific is the door you can push and trust not to swing back on your nose.

“To whom it may entice,” he reads with a grin because he refuses to write to sirs and madams. “This is to say that Marek Novák is a man I taught to respect things that carry current. He can tell a wire’s feeling by the way it refuses to twist. He knows not to force a screw into threads that will resent it later. He learned in old houses with new appetites. He speaks with his hands in a way that assures panicking equipment that it will have another day. He does not burn buildings. He burns for the work. He is the only person I trust to hide a fix in a space where a painter will not later swear. He is stubborn with difficult things and gentle with fragile ones. Take him, and he will work as if you were his neighbor and not his judge.”

Marek cannot say thank you that is big enough, so he puts his cheek into the shape of gratitude and lets it sit there long enough Oldřich has to look away. They drink coffee that is darker than the day and Oldřich insists he take the good pliers, the ones with the bitten handle, because he is least sentimental about objects that have done their duty.

On the way back, Marek stops by a cemetery where his father’s parents live in a rectangle of polished stone, and he stands there without guilt because he has not been a good grandson and because the dead are less strict than the living. A woman two rows over is cleaning a small marker with a toothbrush and humming. Marek says the names on the stone out loud just to see if his mouth remembers them in the original tone, and the wind shows him mercy.

He returns to Prague in the dark, the kind that thinks it knows you. The tram from the station is half asleep and full of people who carry their shopping like an apology. In his building, the hallway shelf holds a different collection today: a chess piece with a missing head, a coil of twine that would tie one good package, a folded note that says in grown-up letters: Nowhere is also somewhere. He lifts the twine and imagines binding all his papers with it and presenting them to a man in an office who will measure it in centimeters of sincerity. He laughs, and in the laugh is relief he cannot justify.

The next day is a partial catastrophe at the theater, and he is grateful because catastrophe clarifies. A fuse in the basement fails in a way that insults not only the fuse but the idea of fuses. There is smoke that behaves politely until it doesn’t. A baritone runs in wearing only one shoe as if that will help, and Radan appears from nowhere because wires call him like relatives do. Marek runs, replaces, breathes, calms a transformer with words you are not supposed to say in front of musical instruments. By the time the soprano arrives, collecting her vowels for rehearsal, the air is normal again. She nods to him in that way that people who hate to look grateful nod, and he accepts the nod like currency.

In the afternoon he sends scanned documents until the computer hums, which is when Ema messages that she has an idea that might be ridiculous. He walks to her flat and finds her with a suitcase on the bed, open and empty like a stage without a prop. She is holding a jack—the jack he fixed—on a cord she’s braided with colored thread. “It’s a stupid charm,” she says. “What if objects need encouragement too? What if we are the ones who need to pretend we can tie luck to ourselves?”

“Pretending is the beginning of some truths,” he says, and helps her thread the cord through the buckle of her bag. She tells him about the upcoming recording in a proper studio, the way they will ask her to be something she is not and how it will take more energy than being herself. He tells her about Brno and Oldřich and how specific is better than polite, and she nods as if that is a recipe. They eat more of the dense cake because it has become talismanic, and because chewing slows decisions into pieces that can be swallowed.

At night, while the city decides whether to snow real snow or imitate the idea, Marek sits at his table and composes the letter Šárka had asked for, the one that explains an absence as if it was an intention. He writes: I have no university because I learned while standing in rooms with water coming through the ceiling. I have no degree because old men in undershirts taught me and then I taught the boxes in the wall to stop acting like divas. I have knowledge that leaves no paper because sometimes the paper is the wall itself and the pencil is a wire, and the proof that it works is the way old women find the light when they wake up at three. He deletes it all because paper is a child, as she said, and replaces it with something shorter and better behaved, which still makes the point if you read with your hands.

On Saturday morning he buys apples with an effort as if that will prevent bruises, and carries them to his mother like evidence that sons can still do certain tricks. She is in an apron that says God Bless This Mess in English and he almost kisses the apron because it is better than kissing the idea that she tried. He fixes her kitchen light with a new switch, and when it clicks like a good sentence she says, “Hmpf,” in a way that means approval that refuses to vote for itself. He tells her about the embassy and Brno and how the city might let him go without calling him a traitor, and she stirs the soup and says, “If you go, you go. You are not a carrot in my pot. You will come back to be eaten and I will pretend not to be hungry.” He laughs and feels like someone has moved his bones into better alignment.

That afternoon, he receives a message from Radim with a photograph of a sky so big you could put your whole hand in and it would still be small. Radim writes: The German with the Czech mother says he likes men who can curse and then repair. He says a man who apologizes to a panel is better than a man who shouts at it. Send the last paper. Don’t worry about the ear thing. They will love yours or not at all, but either way they will still need light.

He sends the last paper with a click that feels like stepping onto a train that may be going in the right direction. He stands by the window and watches a woman across the street teach a child to wrap themselves in a scarf until only her eyes show. The child opens her arms like wings and then falls onto the snow that is trying to be serious. He thinks of Ema in a studio with a red light and a producer who talks like he can hear the ratings. He thinks of himself between a kettle and a fuse box, between this and that, between a city that taught him to listen and a field where the sky is invited into every conversation.

On Monday, the theater is hot with people, the way ovens are hot when the bread is half-baked and everyone is impatient. The new fog machine behaves and then does not, but they coax it toward obedience by giving it a name and saying it kindly. Ema swings by in boots that pretend to be taller than fear and hands him a pastry wrapped in politeness. “For luck,” she says. “Eat sugar before you fight paper.” He eats it and thinks luck tastes a lot like good grease.

Evenings turn into a stack. He works, he visits his mother, he stops by the shelf and finds someone has left a bus ticket from Berlin with the word Nochmal written on it and a drawing of a bicycle. He keeps it because he likes that there are conversations in his hallway no one overhears. He answers a call from the translator who says his original sentences were too difficult to translate because they carry too much weight per word, and he agrees to carry something lighter.

When the day comes for Ema’s studio session, she texts him a location pinned to a part of the city that is not part of the city but rather a series of boxes pretending to be interesting. He takes tram and bus and walks past men in jackets that say SECURITY as if shouting. Inside, there is carpet that mutes anxieties, and a receptionist whose smile is as practiced as an opera rehearsal. Ema is in a small room lit to make everyone look like themselves all the time. She is wearing the jack on her hip like a confession. He smiles and touches the cord and feels silly and then does not.

The sound engineer is a man with a beard that could be an exhibit, and a disposition that implies he once loved sound and now tolerates it. The microphones are lined in a row like a polite party. When Ema tests her voice, a crackle appears like a mosquito you cannot find. Marek’s body leans before his brain does. He looks at the cable, at the board, at the way the engineer’s hand rests on the fader like a man keeping an animal from escaping. He hears the crackle again, and it is the kind that belongs not to the mic but to the environment, to the way a power strip under the table is serving two masters. He crouches, twists his head into a shape that sees behind things, and finds a cheap charger winking maliciously.

“Kill that,” he says to the room, and the engineer looks offended until the room sighs in relief. The crackle disappears. Ema’s shoulders unclasp. The producer claps like he planned the rescue, and Marek stands and scuffs his hand on his pants because humility is a way to keep balance.

She sings. The red light is a sun in a small universe, and her voice is not big but it carries because it refuses to lie. The English lyric takes a corner wrong and then finds itself; the Czech refrain lands like an old chair. It is better than the pastry shop because the room refuses to contribute anything, and so she has to supply it all, and she does. When it is over, the engineer nods, one click of the head, and the producer says words like magic and intimate and reach that have never meant less, and Ema looks at Marek and lifts her eyebrows in a tiny question. He nods, because that is his job here, to be a small anchoring fact.

They leave through a door that nobody uses when they want to be seen, and step into a rectangle of winter light that suggests it has other things to do. They walk without deciding a direction, and after a while they find themselves on a street that remembers horses. Ema puts her hand in her pocket and pulls out a small card. “You left your shell,” she says, and he laughs because he forgot he had, and because of course she would notice he had not been carrying some weight he has become used to.

“I put it on the shelf again,” he says. “It made someone tell me they would go to the sea and then home. I wanted to be that person for a second.”

“You could,” she says simply, and the simplicity is not an instruction but a permission.

They sit on a bench and watch a woman training a dog to ignore pigeons and fail, and they talk about nothing because talking about something all the time is exhausting. He mentions an old wish to build a light with wood and wire that looks like it could be a boat. She mentions a song that refuses to be written in a key people expect. The afternoon declines with dignity. When they stand, they do not decide to kiss, and the decision itself feels intimate. He holds the door of her building with a foot and she runs up to fetch him a book about microphones from the eighties that takes itself too seriously and therefore has become charming, and he considers taking it to New Zealand to explain himself to any machine that wants old wisdom.

At home, he sorts his toolbox with a seriousness people reserve for organs. He puts aside the bits he will leave for the next boy, he oils the hinges of the case, he writes on the lid in a marker that still has scent: IF FOUND, PLEASE RETURN TO A MAN WHO WILL PAY IN BEER. He lies down and feels the fatigue of many small choices, and the thrill of a large one still under construction. Before sleep, he checks his email one more time. The subject line from Immigration reads: Further Assessment.

His heart performs a trick it learned in childhood. He opens the message and reads words that are careful and uncaring, that say they have received and they will consider and they need one more thing because they always do. He takes a breath that puts furniture back where it was. He writes the one more thing. He sends it. He switches off the humming lamp in the corner and the silence is so sudden it sounds like snow. He lies there with the shell on the table, the apple globe grinning in profile, and the city breathing under him, and he understands that whatever sky he lives under, he will have to give it something to do.In the morning, the further assessment sits in his inbox like a guest who has taken off his shoes and put them in the wrong place. The email says the words we regret to inform and then does not regret at all, because it is not a regret machine, it is a check machine. It asks for a chest X-ray because light must pass through him and be caught on film to prove he is not hiding anything more alive than breath. It asks for fingerprints because his hands are not trusted to be only hands. It suggests he attend a panel physician whose panel is not a wood panel but a list, and it implies he should do these things with a smile. Marek drinks his coffee and burns his tongue again, because he is a man who believes in preparing the same small pain for company so the larger pain will not feel so proud. He puts the shell in his pocket and the apple globe into the middle of the table as if it can watch him and be impressed. He calls the clinic and an efficient voice tells him to bring identification and not to bring hope because hope is considered a liquid and may spill.

The clinic is warm and full of pale plants whose job is to reassure the eye that someone waters something here. The receptionist takes his name and turns it into a lowercase thing that fits onto a label. He sits between a man with the kind of shoulders that take up two chairs and a girl whose hair makes its own plans around her head. The wall television plays a documentary about birds who fly without visas, and Marek tries not to take it personally. When they call his name, they call it in a way that suggests it is not entirely safe to be called anything. The nurse who leads him down the corridor walks with an economy that has been turned into art by repetition. She smiles with the half of her mouth that is not exhausted and says, “Breath in, breath out,” so many times in a day she probably says it in her sleep.

The X-ray room is the belly of a machine that needs him to flatten himself into explanation. He presses his chest against the cold plate and thinks of the printout that spent a day there, the offer that made his ribs feel like a constellation. The technician whom the nurse has called by name without vowels tells him to hold his breath and the click of the apparatus sounds like a small door closing on a small animal. Later, at a metal desk that is colder than it looks, a doctor with a tie that features small palm trees reviews a form with boxes that want to know if he ever coughed more than a poetic amount. The doctor asks him what he does and his eyebrows lift when Marek says the word electrician. “Ah,” the eyebrows say, because they do most of the work, “someone who believes in invisible forces.”

Leaving the clinic, the day feels heavier, as if the X-ray had identified a missing piece and added it back into his pocket in the form of paperwork. He squints at the light and thinks of Radim’s sky that refuses ceilings. A tram clatters by and for a second he feels the city pass through him like radiation he has secretly wanted all along. On the sidewalk, a boy in a puffy jacket sells paper snowflakes from a cardboard box and says, “Real ones, fifty crowns,” with such belief it becomes true. Marek buys one and tucks it into his wire notebook so that when he opens it later, something cut will fall and remind him that pattern is just a knife used gently.

He works in the afternoon because work is the form his body chooses when judgment arrives and asks for a dance. The office in Smíchov is a maze of desks trying to pretend they are home furniture. He rewires a junction where someone else has done violence to a neutral wire months ago and the building has been living with the outcome like a marriage that never made sense. A woman in an orange sweater asks if it is safe to make coffee and he says it is always safe to make coffee, which is not true but is the right lie for this moment. When he leaves, he opens the stairwell window because the building breathes like a man who has had to carry a piano and expects gratitude.

That night, Ema knocks on his door with a friendliness that is almost a dictated letter because she is holding a bowl under a tea towel and the bowl has weight. He lets her in and she puts the bowl on his table and the table is grateful because it got to hold an apple globe and now soup. She says, “They made me sing it twice,” and he laughs because of course they did. She tells him a story about a producer who wants her to forget her consonants so that people will like her more, and he tells her about the doctor with the palm trees and the way his lungs had to prove their geography. They eat and she tastes like pepper and he tastes like worry and they both taste like neighbors, which is to say shared air. When she leaves she takes one of his spoons because she thinks it is hers and he does not correct the theft because sometimes you let a small error sit beside you to distract bigger ones that might come.

Winter tries to remember the part where it snows. It starts with an argument with the clouds and then agrees on a style and then forgets again. The city makes decisions one street at a time. In Žižkov the wind insists on calling meetings at corners. In Vinohrady the trees suggest compromise. On a day when nothing dramatic happens, the elevator in his mother’s building refuses to choose a floor, so it chooses not to choose and stops between second and third like a man who has been asked to define happiness. Marek is in the area because he has convinced himself that approved clinics like to be near mothers, and when the phone rings and it is her voice doing the particular “hm” that means both inconvenience and an argument with gravity, he goes. He arrives to find Karel’s wife stuck in the elevator with two bags of groceries and the specific fury of a person who has remembered they forgot to buy the thing they came out for.

Marek crouches in the little room above the elevator car where the pulleys look like a history lesson. He can hear her making polite threats down the shaft. He throws the manual release and the cable slacks like a man who has decided to take off his tie in public. He leans on a lever that controls more than it pretends to. The elevator scowls and then yields and he is careful because he knows too many stories in which the hero dies of boredom and metal. He gets the doors to open and Karel’s wife steps out with her dignity intact and her groceries bruised. His mother has a sentence ready that she pretends just came to her. “See?” she says, and pats him on the arm as if he has just proved a principle. “Men who know where the screws are should not leave their mothers.”

At the pub, later, Kuba tells him about a man in his office who wears a different wristwatch on each arm because he wants to know exactly when his life splits into ideas, and then admits he made the man up so he could complain. He asks serious questions in a voice that pretends to make fun. “And what will you do,” he says, “if a sheep steals your toolbox?” Marek pushes his beer back and forth across a wet ring on the table and says he will negotiate, because the sheep would be half of a government out there. They talk about nothing until the nothing demands respect. They watch the barman pretend not to eavesdrop the way he always pretends not to. When Marek mentions the X-ray, Kuba flinches because bodies make him nervous and love makes him worse. “You’ll be fine,” he says, eyes on the football on television that looks like an argument solved by a rectangle of grass. “Your chest sounds like electricity. They love that out there. They worship plugs.”

On a day that is not expected to carry much, a storm arrives with the attitude of a guest who knocks and comes in at the same time. Wind persuades snow into horizontal, and the sky discovers how to be low. In the tenement on Bílkova the shoemaker’s light gasps like a small marathoner and then gives up. It is not just him. The entire block wavers and then dims into a compromise that satisfies no lamp. Someone calls Radan, someone calls Marek, and then someone calls everybody because that is how these days go. Marek pulls on his boots and his coat and his wool hat that makes him look like the son of a fisherman on a pamphlet. In the street the snow tastes like failures past and he opens his mouth and lets it keep him humble.

The building on Bílkova sighs when he arrives and pretends not to have needed him. He traces the fault by ear and by nose, a trick Oldřich taught him and he thought was magic until he realized it was only attention. A distribution board in the basement hums like a hive with its queen missing. He opens it with sympathy and someone behind him inhales, the sound of a person about to be impressed or disappointed. It is the shoemaker, of course, his apron a history book. “You came,” the man says, and it is not a surprise because of course he did, but you say it because it is polite to the universe. Marek replaces a breaker with a piece that has waited in his toolbox for this exact personality. He cleans a contact that had been courting dust. A child peeks around the door and decides the electrician is not as interesting as the snow. The light comes back like a person who has remembered a detail that makes the story work.

By the time he trudges home, his eyelashes have learned to carry weight. Ema's door is ajar, which in this building always means something other than in movies. He taps it and she calls, “Come on,” and he does, stamping off snow into a pattern on her mat that looks like a map of a small country. She is knitting with a seriousness that suggests punishable offenses in another life. The heavy yarn runs between her fingers like an argument she is winning. She says, “They want me to sing a song called Leave Light On. Isn’t that a bit much?” He shrugs and sits and watches her pull the wool through its own previous mistakes. She says she will go to Brno after all, the aunt’s health demanding a performance of affection that will be exhausting and clean. She asks if he can look after the plant in her window that believes in impossible suns. He says yes and she smiles in a way that awards him a point he cannot spend.

The hallway shelf holds, the next morning, a little glass bottle with a cork. Inside is sand like the color of old teeth and a note that says in a handwriting that either belongs to a child or a prankster adult: For when the city is too solid. Marek takes it and sets it beside the apple globe, which has learned his hours and now acts like it belongs to the table. He goes to the theater and Luka throws him a cable as if truth comes only at velocity. Radan calls from the balcony like a ship’s captain and Marek salutes with a screwdriver because it is the closest thing he has to a flag. The dimmer issue settles after half an hour of patience and one minute of swearing in a language not on the official list. He is washing his hands in a sink that was installed before the city decided to distinguish between backstage and back room when his phone trembles with a message from Šárka at the embassy. He opens it with wet hands and leaves a little comet across the screen. The message is not yes. It is not no. It is a request for a phone interview because paper needs a voice sometimes to turn into decision.

He chooses the call time and spends the day practicing not to be himself because himself is a man who makes jokes when anxiety visits. He writes down sentences that sound like men in suits approved them and then crosses them out because paper is a child but phones are sophisticated. He tells Ema about the call and she records three greetings for him in a voice that is not hers but expands at the end of the phrase like he has earned something. He does not use them but carries them in his ear like talismans anyway. When the moment comes he stands at his window and looks at the street he knows better than his own breathing and says hello to a woman named Annika who has a smile he cannot see but he can hear it in the way she says his name right the first time.

The interview is not as cruel as he learns to expect and not as kind as he wishes. Annika asks about the work and he speaks of roofs that need to drink light and the way fields carry it to houses that do not know the sun is behind a panel. She asks about safety and he tells her about being a man who checks before he touches, about old houses that do not want to be modern and new houses that do not want to be safe. She asks about leaving and he does not tell the version of the story where his mother’s hand holds his sleeve at the last turn of the stairs. He says instead that he wants to carry his skills where they are asked for, that he believes in local wiring and global light, that he is stubborn and patient and that these things are enemies who have learned to drink together. When he hangs up, his shirt is damp under the arms in a way that used to embarrass him and now feels like belonging.

Days fold, then unfold, then fold again because that is how time behaves when you wait but also work. The shoemaker brings him a repaired belt with holes that look as if they were born on that leather. His mother sends him half a cake in a container that used to hold something else and a note that says simply, Bring the container back. Kuba texts him a photograph of a sheep from the internet with a face like a man who has just been told he has won a prize he did not enter for. Ema returns from Brno with a tiredness that sits on her shoulders like a shawl and a packet of wafers that claim to be famous. She tells him her aunt’s heart beats in triple time and the doctors have taught it a rhythm that does not fit in a song. He tells her that he fixed a light in a stairwell for a woman who did not say thank you but wiped her eyes and that was better. They sit with these facts until they become part of the wall.

One evening he finds himself alone with the idea of making something and he does not resist it. He takes wood from under his bed where good intentions live, and he takes wire from his bag where necessity lives, and he takes a bulb from a box that says delicately and he knows that means it will fight him and pretend to break. On the table he arranges parts until they look like a sentence and then he rearranges until the sentence stops lying. He builds a lamp that is not a lamp yet, shaped like a small boat that could hold two figs and a hope. He sands the wood so that hands will not resent it. He loops the wire in a way that would make Oldřich nod once. He fits the bulb into a socket that he has convinced to trust him. When he plugs it in and it lights, it lights like an agreement, and he feels both more ridiculous and more possible. He writes Ema’s name on a scrap and tucks it into the hull because the boat needs a passenger, and then he takes it back out because superstition is a salt that should be applied lightly.

When he gives it to her, he pretends it is nothing but an experiment and she pretends to believe him because she understands that the truth is a shy guest. She places it on the little table by her window and the plant approves by becoming greener. She says, “This is like the way language works when you sing it right, it carries you without making you drown,” and he tells her not to drown and she says she does not plan to. They talk about the recording that will air in a week and the way she does not want her mouth edited into an idea. He tells her about the way the embassy turns names into shapes and shapes into documents and documents into decisions. She turns to him and says, “You are not made of paper. Remember that when they tell you you are.” He nods and pockets the reminder like a lighter he will forget he has until the exact moment he needs fire.

He goes to his mother with new apples and the old container. She regards the lamp after he shows her photos with the suspicion she reserves for objects she suspects will want to live in her home. “It is pretty,” she says, with a resigned kindness that concedes beauty the right to be in the world. “Does it dust?” He tells her all things dust, and she says, “Then your son will have to visit more often with a rag.” She asks no new questions about the visa because she has learned that questions are hands that pull at threads. Instead, she tells him a story about a neighbor who fell in love with a weatherman because he only promised what could be measured, and he thinks, not for the first time, that his mother is smarter than he can handle safely.

On a Wednesday that hates the number five for reasons it refuses to share, the power goes out on Vodičkova in a way that challenges not just the theater but the idea of ambition. A transformer up the line grimaces and throws a small tantrum. Marek and Luka and two municipal men in vests the color of advertisements stand in sleet and coax it back with the patience of people who have been in worse weather with worse machines. The soprano warms up in the dark and the sound finds unexpected corners to test. The director comes outside in a scarf that could solve problems by itself and says, “Do we have to cancel?” in a tone that already knows the answer. Marek looks at the men and then at the hiss of the sleet and then at the city which is listening and says, “No,” because sometimes you defy the weather not because you can win but because people hired a babysitter and put on nice shoes. The light is coaxed into an approximation of normal, and the audience sits grateful and suspicious. The fog machine behaves, the dimmers hold, the mezzanine forgets itself in exactly the right places, and after the performance the soprano nods at him in the alley as if not-hating him has become a hobby.

News, when it arrives, refuses to be dramatic because drama is for films about people who do not have to go to work in the morning. The email from Immigration reads the same as the last until he sees the sentence that is different. It says his medical results are acceptable and his police certificate is acceptable and his references are acceptable and his voice on the phone is acceptable and he is a person they can imagine in a field under a sky with a harness. It says they are prepared to grant something that sounds like a miracle but is actually a stamp. It says something about conditions that sound like the ingredients list on a packaged sauce, and it says he has to send his passport to a place that will glue a permission into it like a page from a child’s book. It does not say congratulations because the machine does not have that button, but he reads it anyway between the lines and hears Radim cheering through a poor connection and Radan pretending to scowl while he secretly shines.

His mother receives the news with an expression that rearranges furniture in his memory. She says, “Ah,” and then, “Well,” and then, “There you are,” as if he had been hiding behind a door she had known about all along. She does not cry because she has rehearsed not crying in front of him since he was born. She does not make him soup because making soup for a man who is leaving turns soup into a metaphor and she is not in the mood. She says, “Take your father’s hammer,” and he says, “I cannot take a hammer on a plane,” and she says, “Hide it in your stubbornness,” and he nods because the image fits and because he can feel the weight of it already.

Ema listens in the place between her breath and her throat and then smiles and says, “Of course,” in a way that carries nothing but permission. She does not ask him for promises because she is not interested in plants that die if you are not home by Thursday. She tells him she has been asked to perform a song at a small event that pretends not to be a big event, and she asks if he will come. He says yes because his body already knows the shape of that room, and because there are things you do before you pack the last shirt that make a future less abstract. The event turns out to be in a room in an old brewery with a ceiling high enough to hear the aftertaste of notes. She sings a song someone else wrote about keeping the light on and then a song she wrote about not apologizing for building little boats that fit on tables, and people in the audience cheer like they own their houses. Marek stands in the dark by the door with a coat over his arm and thinks about how you can tell when a room is honest by the way the floor agrees to carry the weight.

After, in the alley that smells like beer’s family tree, she steps into a cone of streetlight as if it were a rehearsal for being admired. He stands next to her and they do not speak for a moment because silence is a form of conversation when the subject is large. She says finally, “You will have to send me a recording of your wind so I know what key to be lonely in,” and he says he will send her a recording of his lunch conversation with a pie so she can improvise. She reaches out and puts her hand flat against his chest as if to check the X-ray for herself, and he does not breathe because he has been taught this is how you get caught in a good way. Then she takes her hand back because the world is watching even when it isn’t, and because they have decided not to collapse into an easier story.

The passport leaves his pocket and becomes a parcel that the post office stamps in a way that suggests both competence and fate. He stands in line while a man at the next window argues about the price of sending a sweater to his sister in Ostrava and a woman in front of him sighs like an amateur trumpet. When the clerk looks at him, she squints as if he is a translation and says, “Important?” and he says, “Yes,” and she says, “Everything is,” in a tone that suggests she has a drawer full of stamps for these moments. He leaves with a receipt that could be a promise or a receipt, and he decides to treat it like the first thing because it will make the walk home warmer.

Packing happens in waves, like grief and productivity and snow. He folds shirts with a competence learned in a hostel in Kraków where the boy in the bunk below taught him a trick with cuffs that changed his life more than it should have. He puts the good pliers in the case along with the work gloves that saved him from a nail that looked like democracy and behave like a traitor. He takes down the world map and rolls it into a tube that looks like a lying scroll. He leaves the apple globe on the table because it has set down roots, and he writes a note that says, For the building, to be spun when a decision feels like it weighs more than its actual weight. He tapes it to the globe and adds a piece of string so the next person to borrow it will know they have permission.

On the last evening before the passport returns to him with proof glued inside, he walks the city into his feet on purpose. He starts at his building and goes left because right would be too tidy. He walks past the kiosk where the old woman sweeps and today she is sitting, broom propped like a standing friend, telling a pigeon a secret. He walks past the shop that sells sweets wrapped like arguments won long ago. He stands on a bridge and does not look at the river because it will demand a metaphor and he is out of fresh ones. He walks through the square where the astronomer with the clock has made generations feel like the gear was invented for them. He stands outside the theater and does not go in because he has said goodbye to the dimmers already and he does not want to become one of those men who measure partings by how many people have to be there. He stops in front of the embassy and looks at the window where the machine gives numbers and he thanks it, because it is easier to thank a machine than a person, and then he thanks Šárka and Jana and the doctor and the parrot clock and Oldřich and Radan and, because he is not a fool, his mother. He does not say the names out loud because the city would hear him and he is shy.

When he gets home, the passport sits on the doormat in a brown envelope that looks like any other envelope, and he holds it as if heat might melt the glue too soon. He sits at the table, he opens it, he reads the lines that make him legal and therefore more imaginary than he has ever been, and he laughs. He laughs because men on television cry when they get these things and he is not on television and he has a ridiculous lamp shaped like a boat that makes the room look like a good decision. He sends three messages: one to Radim with a picture of the stamp and the single word Done, one to Radan with just the smile face from 2003 because he knows the man will respect the lack of eloquence, and one to Ema that says, I will go and then I will return sometimes and you will tell me when the plant has learned a new word for sun.

In the doorway, before sleep, he takes the apple globe and places it on the hallway shelf, because he has learned that some things want to be handled by more than one set of hands before they are useful. He adds the little bottle of sand with the note to it so that the next person can decide to think about the sea and sit down and not leave at all. He stands there, coat unbuttoned, bootlaces untied, listening to the building breathe, to the city hum, to the way decisions make a bass note under your day. A door opens two floors down and someone laughs, the kind of laugh that starts with a surprise and ends in permission. He smiles because he is still here, and then he turns back into his flat where the boat-lamp waits and the wire roller is a sleeping animal and his bed is a story he enters and leaves and enters again, and he sleeps because when morning comes, the tram will sigh and carry him as if he were always going to this particular stop.The morning moves as if someone has oiled the hinges of it. Marek wakes knowing a thing he did not know yesterday, and the knowledge is the size of a stamp but alters the gravity in the room. He makes coffee that tastes like a decision and burns his tongue minutely enough that it can stand as the day’s acceptable loss. On the table the brown envelope sleeps like an animal that has delivered its young and gone back to being only itself. He touches the page with the permission glued into his passport and waits for a sensation that does not arrive because paper cannot make you larger, only braver. Outside, the tram gives its familiar patient sigh and he finds himself saying a hello back quietly, as if it were rude to bring volume to a morning that is doing its job.

He takes out his toolbox, opens it like a chest, and begins the ritual you do when you are leaving but refuse to treat objects like soldiers abandoned at a border. He chooses the bits he will take and the ones that will belong to the next pair of hands; he wipes handles smooth; he wraps the pliers Oldřich gave him in a rag that was once a shirt that once was an afternoon by the river. He writes a note on the underside of the lid for the boy who will inherit the tools he leaves at the theater: Remember the wires know the path. Do not fight them unless they are wrong. He stops himself from adding a drawing because that would make it into a lesson and he is not leaving to become a teacher. He is leaving to see if the things he knows have another shape in another air.

Radan pretends to be furious for half a morning and then cannot carry the pretense. At the workshop he pushes a cardboard box toward Marek with the injured generosity of a man who once swore to never be sentimental about equipment. Inside lie the half of the drills he promised and a roll of gaffer tape with a dent in it that plays as a signature. “I’m not throwing you a party,” Radan says, because parties make a man into a conclusion, “but I’m making you do the tedious thing at Smíchov so you remember we were also dull together.” He instructs Marek to take a meter reading here and a measurement there, and then he stands too close and inspects him for signs of departure as if it might announce itself on the skin like a rash. Marek nods at the tedious thing because that, too, is love, and then he says the only thing that fits in the room without knocking cups off shelves. “I’ll be back when you least want me,” he says, and Radan grunts, waves him away, and then adds, “Take a photograph of a sheep for me. I want to see if they are really so smug.”

At his mother’s, the floor is newly washed and threatens anyone who would disrespect it. She has moved a chair by the window as if rearranging small objects could keep a son in a place by creating no obvious path out. He brings apples that will bruise anyway. She brings him a box that once held chocolates and now keeps a scattering of paper clips, a spool of thread, a photograph of him with ice cream ruined down his shirt, and the kind of talismans mothers make from anything. “You can’t take the hammer,” she says, before he can begin the ritual of refusal and acceptance, “but you can take this.” She presses a thimble into his palm with her fingers wrapped around his as if teaching him a fact about friction. “That thing,” she continues, her voice on a bus route it has used before, “goes on the finger you hurt most. When it is on, you are still ours. When you take it off, you are still ours.” He swallows a laugh because a laugh would scratch the lacquer on her dignity, and he slides the thimble onto his left ring finger because that is the one he always sacrifices to stubborn screws.

They eat lunch in a way that makes time behave. She ladles soup and does not fuss. He tells her about the woman at the embassy who allowed herself a smile, about the doctor with palm trees, about the fog machine that behaves only when given a name. She tells him about the neighbor whose son plays the piano without being asked and how the music arrives up the stairwell like mercy you didn’t order and cannot return. There is a pause that opens like a door and she closes it with a sentence that will live inside his ear. “Write when you are happy,” she says. “People only remember to write when they are sad. Then I will think the new place is all sadness. Lie to me if you have to. Lie beautifully.” He nods and says he will do her that respect because she has earned even his helpful falsehoods.

On the building’s hallway shelf, the apple globe he left last night has acquired companions. There is the bottle of sand with its tooth-colored grit and the note for some future day. There is also a toy airplane made from the folded tinfoil of a pastry, a delicate thing with wings that refuse to give up the idea of flight. Someone has written around its fuselage in pen: In case you forget how. Marek stares at it and feels something he cannot name because names are also handles and he fears this one will not fit in his pocket. He does not take the airplane; he leaves it for the next person who needs a scale model of insistence. He leaves instead a stub of pencil, sharpened to stubbornness, with a twist of paper around it that says, in his straight, stubborn hand: For making maps nobody else has to believe.

When he tells Ema the date, she nods like someone being told a timetable she does not intend to fight. She does not ask for a goodbye that performs itself. She will not come to the airport because that is a theater she has no desire to inhabit, and he will not ask her to because he cannot afford a last scene with props and lighting and audiences that include men with clipboards. They are too fond of dignity to put it on a stage. Instead they agree to a dawn. “The bridge at six,” she says. “The air is intelligent then.” He knows which bridge and what she means, and the knowing has the comfort of a hand that does not need to prove itself by squeezing.

The last day at the theater smells like dust and cologne and endings disguised as errands. Luka brings a bottle of something clear that he claims is from a grandmother and everyone pretends to doubt the legality so they can make toasts that sound like jokes. The soprano, in civilian clothes and a winter hat that has no respect for glamour, lurks until the men who make light from wires remember that voices are powered by air, and then she shakes Marek’s hand with a grip that could start or end wars and says, “You kept my C from catching fire,” as if it were a kind of medal. Radan waits until the last box is taped and then takes Marek out to the stage itself, empty and vast, a room that holds every nervous breath it has housed and lets none escape entirely. “Look,” he says, because some men cannot give speeches and so point. “Not many get to leave from here.” Marek takes in the black floor with its scuffs and ghosts and thinks of all the feet that learned courage on this rectangle. He nods, because you do not talk to a room like this when it is being generous.

Kuba invents a reason for a beer knowing he needs none. He tells Marek a story about a man who went to Australia and spent five years teaching kangaroos to queue properly, and when Marek asks if it is true, Kuba holds up his hands and says, “It is not my duty to translate the world accurately. It is my duty to keep you laughing into the airport.” They laugh deep and dark and leave the corners of the city the way you leave a kitchen after a party: by turning off small lights and picking up cups you did not notice earlier. At the end he hugs Marek longer than he intends and then breaks it with a curse because he is tone-policing his own tenderness. “Send me candy wrapped in instructions in a language I don’t speak,” he orders, and Marek swears it, because those are the vows of men who will not do marriage but will do everything sister to it.

The bridge at six is a different country from the bridge at noon. The Vltava is a sheet of folded steel, the air is cold enough to keep secrets crisp, and the first tourists are still asleep in rooms that carry the smell of other people’s holidays. Ema is already there, her coat collar like a small fort around her throat, her hands in her pockets as if they are storing contraband warmth. They walk without speaking at first and their body language contains an unspoken promise not to accelerate or slow down too much. When they reach the spot where the railing remembers all the elbows that leaned there to pretend the city was theirs, they stop. Ema takes out her phone and plays him a recording, not of a song but of water in the pipes of her building at night. “I thought I would miss ugly sounds,” she says. “I thought I would send you beauty and then decided you might need this instead.” He listens to the slow complaint of metal and water negotiating and he smiles because grief taught him to love mundane noises, and he is grateful to have their thick comfort in his pocket where the shell also sits.

They trade objects like smugglers. She gives him a small square notebook with thick paper that cannot be tempted to bleed and a pencil she has bitten as if to assure him it has already been human. He gives her a plug adaptor he bought, absurdly bulked and ready, with the promise that it is a symbol and not a demand. “You will write to me sometimes like you’re wiring a wall,” she says. “Simple sentences, no metaphors, no seduction. Tell me where the junctions are.” He nods and then contradicts himself by taking her hand and turning it over and writing a sentence on her palm with his finger: The lights here know your name now. She closes her fingers, trapping the text, and then opens them again because you cannot keep a sentence like that captive without losing something.

They do not say goodbye because the word is a staircase and they do not want to hear their feet on it. They say, “Go,” and “Sing,” and “Write,” and “Call,” and “Carry this for a bit,” and “See that,” and the smaller words are masts that hold up an invisible boat. He walks away first because he has someone else’s trick of leaving parties before he becomes the orphaned center. She stands and watches him until he is smaller than his decisions and then she turns the other way because she has a recording to do and a plant to keep alive that believes in suns that do not appear in weather reports.

The night before, he dreams not of ladders but of gates. He stands before one that looks like the welded doors of a transformer cabinet and it is locked, and he is briefly the boy who cannot pick the right key. Then he remembers to look up and sees the sky above it needs no permission and he laughs in his sleep in a way that unnerves the cat in the radiator in Ema’s flat, three floors down, because cats dislike human epiphanies. In the morning he packs the last comb he forgot he owns and tucks the thimble into the little zipper pocket in his bag that used to save him from a handful of confetti of screws. He looks around the room one last time to make sure no object feels betrayed. The boat-lamp by Ema’s window will light. The world map will unroll for someone else when they borrow it from the shelf. His table, with its small burns and its pencil scars, will accept a new owner the way old friends accept a new joke.

The airport is the opposite of a theater and exactly the same. People perform competence in lines and are rewarded with permission to perform endurance in chairs. The security conveyor belt eats his bag and returns it chewed slightly and he watches his headphones occupy a plastic tray with the caution of a sleeping snake. A young man in a vest the color of warning holds up his screwdriver with the long shaft and says, “No,” and Marek says, “Yes, it is a screwdriver,” and their comedy runs aground. Marek surrenders the tool that has opened fifty stubborn plates and considers it a reasonable offering to the gods of flight. He steps into his stocking feet along with everyone else, becomes briefly anonymous, and tries to remember if he has ever walked from a life to another life in fewer moves. In the duty-free he does not shop because perfume is a language he does not need to learn in the hour he has left.

At the gate, a child plays airplane with her arms out and nobody tells her she is making a metaphor. A man in a suit reads a document that probably contains more sorrow than his face will admit. A grandmother eats an apple with such conviction everyone within sight remembers that there is a way to be present that does not require a screen. Marek texts Radim a photograph of an airplane wing reflected in glass, and Radim replies with a photograph of a field of panels catching dawn at an angle that makes them look like a school of fish. He writes to his mother that he is boarding and she sends back simply: Remember ears, which could mean the embassy’s requirement or could mean that he should listen, and he decides to accept both.

When the plane lifts, the city falls away with the practiced humility of a place that knows it survives people leaving. For a moment everything is a model. The bridge is a line of light that remembers the elbow. The river is not solder now; it is a ribbon snipped at the end. The theater is a black rectangle, the alleys are stitches. He leans into the small oval of window and knows which roofs hold apartments where friends are cutting bread and arguing with kettles. He cannot see Ema but he can hear the invisible treaty she writes with the air when she sings. He feels the way the plane’s body thrums with a power that is both mechanical and coaxed, and it comforts him to be traveling in a machine that requires more faith in bolts than destiny.

The flight is an education in air. Hours become a thing you carry in your lap instead of a thing that is happening to you. A woman next to him, with hair braided like a quiet crown, knits without looking and the click of her needles sounds like snow reported from the next room. On the screen in front of him a map shows their progress across colors that ignore borders, and he watches the little icon airplane brave increments. The meal arrives wrapped in too much plastic and tastes exactly like a compromise. He thinks about pies that smell like mince and apologies and feels prepared. He reads the letter from Oldřich again because it holds, in its misspelling of To whom it may entice, an instruction to treat seriousness like a friend who sometimes gets drunk. He tries to sleep and dreams briefly of a shoemaker who sews the sky with carried-over thread and says the hem will hold if you don’t tug, and he wakes with the conviction that it will be fine if he does.

In the cold dim of the cabin he takes the shell out of his pocket and holds it to his ear like a cliché, prepared to laugh at himself, and then he hears it: not the sea, which would be too obedient a symbol, but the deep consistent hum of the plane, the air being pushed and surrendered, the voices around him turned to a single fabric. He puts the shell back because it has learned something new and he does not want to overload it. He writes in Ema’s thick-paper notebook since the cabin drowns metaphors and leaves them to float for anyone to catch. He draws the outline of a barn roof and the path of a cable to a panel and marks the places where the screw will fight him and writes beside it, because he cannot help himself: Remember that fear is a bad electrician. He turns the page and sketches the city only by the sounds: tram sigh here, church huff there, the murmuring elevator, the boil of a kettle, the exact hinge of his mother’s window, the cough of the fog machine before the truth. He feels more competent with a pencil than with any speech the immigration asked of him.

The stopover—the strange halfway city that looks like a promise sold in chrome—holds him for a few hours and then forgets him with the relief of restaurants at closing time. He walks through corridors that smell like countries condensed into cleaner and spice. He buys a postcard printed with an image that does not bother to be accurate and writes on it to his mother: It is very big here and everything is wrapped in climate, then realizes he cannot send it until he lands somewhere that requires postage, and tucks it into the notebook along with a boarding pass that will be nothing soon. A barista calls him “mate” with unearned intimacy, a rehearsal for what the word will feel like when it arrives in a voice that has salt in it.

Back on the plane, a child screams for a while with a commitment that makes him think of sopranos. An older man in the aisle seat explains to anyone who will listen the principle of flying because narration makes fear think you control it. Marek checks the thimble in his pocket and looks at his hands, which are not used to being idle and therefore invent tasks like counting the bolts on the seat track and deciding which ones have a history. He is surprised to discover that he can be sentimental toward clouds if given enough hours; he starts naming them after streets and then disciplines himself back into a man.

Somewhere beyond any map he has internalized, dawn arrives like a promise kept by a bureaucrat. The light is thin and then obvious and then inside the cabin in a way he did not invite and is glad for. People stir and pretend they have always been awake. The crew begin again their rituals with the same kind faces they used when the world was dark and aisle-shaped. Marek leans into the window and the ocean below is no longer an idea but a skin. In the sky ahead, somewhere, the place he has pinned will refuse to be smaller than his expectation. He thinks of fields with panels like a new religion’s pews, of wind that is not made by buses, of a boss who presses both palms when he shakes, of Radim’s grin splitting a morning, of a pie that will apologize for itself before he can take a bite, of a socket that is different and exactly the same. He thinks, also, of the building back in Žižkov where the apple globe sits on the shelf with its string, waiting for a hand to spin it and a person to look. He thinks of Ema stepping into a room and changing the temperature by breathing.

Descent is a negotiation you cannot help but overhear. The plane adjusts itself like a pragmatic animal, the passengers adjust themselves like people who want to appear competent in chairs. The runway rises with the ambition of cement. Marek feels the physics of the landing like an honest handshake: a little rough, supremely workable. Wheels kiss, brakes declare themselves, a murmur passes like a small wave through a meadow, and the cabin’s people become citizens of somewhere else not by law but by agreement. He sits, suddenly tired, pleasantly scared, calm in the jaw, and waits for the doors to open because doors are the trick the world uses to get you to understand it is all thresholds.

When he steps out into the air of the new place, it tastes like the inside of a refrigerator that has been cleaned recently, and his breath makes a cloud that is less about cold and more about the body realizing it can take up visible space without apology. He follows signs that do not bother to be gentle and stands where he is told to stand and shows what he is asked to show. A woman in a uniform for whom the sun is a coworker looks at his permission and at his face and then breaks into a smile that does not belong to her job but arrives anyway. “Welcome, Marek,” she says, correctly, and the way she pronounces his name does not make it a tourist. He says thank you with more sincerity than the moment requests. The sliding doors open and the light on the other side looks unembarrassed. He lifts his bag, feels the thimble press his skin, and thinks to himself that the room he had not yet swept will need a broom. He has brought one. He steps out, and the sky does not hurry him, which is all he has asked.The first thing that happened to him outside the sliding doors was that the air refused to behave like any he had known. It had the clean chill of a supermarket’s dairy aisle and the exact, forgiving humidity of a bathroom that had learned what steam could do to a mirror. The light did not fall; it settled, as if it knew people here did not enjoy being startled in the morning. A man in an orange vest with a company logo on it that made no attempt to be mysterious held up a sign that said MAREK and then, underneath, added mate? with a question mark as if the punctuation could make the word gentler. Radim arrived from some direction that had pretended not to be there, his smile already talking, his arms making a house around Marek for a second before stepping back. The ute he drove had the kind of face vehicles get after surviving many gravel roads and one misplaced cow, and there were zip ties gathered in its cup holder like a bouquet no one would ever throw.

They drove with music low because the conversation has to make a shape first and find where it folds. The motorway let itself be a road without expecting romance, and then, almost without announcement, there were fields that did not belong to postcards but to people who needed to cut hay at a sensible hour. Rows of shelterbelt trees stuttered along the horizon like bar codes, and paddocks laid down squares of green in shades that cities forget to manufacture. Radim pointed with a finger that had learned how to hold a spanner and a baby. “That ridge, there,” he said, “is where we’ll put in forty kilowatts for a dairy shed with a temper. The wind comes like a conversation you didn’t ask to join. The cows will watch you as if you were explaining something to them and failing. The boss is waiting at the yard with pies that apologize before you bite.” He grinned, and Marek let the rush of names and measurements steady him the way some people use prayer.

The yard was a geometry of rails and frames and wooden pallets turned into furniture by necessity. A magpie on the fence offered a warble that sounded like a keyboard trying a logic exercise. The German with the Czech mother came out of a corrugated office that wore its rust like a badge, and he pressed both palms to Marek’s hands the way the email had promised. “Matthias,” he said, making the tt into something soft, and then in neat Czech with a German rhythm that made the vowels stand up straight, “Vítej, Marek. I am borrowing you from your city. Keep the receipt. You can send me back if I break you.” His hair was the color of responsible weather, and the corners of his eyes carried years of squinting at sky. He gave Marek a high-vis vest with the company name that made it sound like a choir—Arc Light—and then, without drama, led him across a concrete yard where variegated dogs paced as if to keep the day on schedule.

He was introduced to a cluster of men and women who would share roofs with him. Jo was a linesman from Leyte with a smile like a leveled plank and a habit of humming three notes over and over when his brain was busy. Poppy had forearms that told the truth in any language and the kind of careful eyes that made animals stop panicking. Tom was twenty-two and blurry with enthusiasm, skinny from surfing in cold water and convinced that every problem had a hack until he learned otherwise and then, to his credit, learned otherwise. They made space for him in the circle around a trestle table where the objects were already stories: harnesses with neat buckles, spools of PV cable that looked like tamed snakes, a box of ferrites that felt like beads at a church no one could agree how to decorate. Radim handed him a pie wrapped in paper that said nothing because it didn’t need to, and he bit into a taste that was meat and memory and something halfway to sweet and decided he could allow his mouth new definitions.

There was the matter of a bed and a roof that were not his work. The share house wore its weatherboard like it had considered other options and returned to good wood with relief. The hallway had a runner that held the stories of previous inhabitants in its threads, and the kitchen held three kinds of chili sauce and a roster on a whiteboard that said who would cook on which day in handwriting that betrayed ambition and forgetfulness. Marek was given a room with a bed that had learned springs in the sixties and a window that practiced being a square of God at dusk. He placed his bag in the corner with the reverence due to an object that had gone through countries. The first night he stood in the yard and listened. The sound held crickets with no guilt, a distant road like a rope pulled slowly, and a bird that refused to be discreet about its flute. He sent a recording of that insistence to Ema because she had asked for the key of his wind, and she sent back a voice note that was not a song and not not a song, a piece of breath and vowels that turned the yard into a slightly different shape.

Work, when it began, was cleanly physical. The first roof he stood on belonged to a dairy shed that had learned new roofs twice already and therefore did not trust men with drills. The corrugations laid their regular objections under his boots, and the harness traced a neat diagonal across his chest that felt like both punctuation and promise. The sun had the good manners to be honest, and a wind came from somewhere obvious and then disappeared as if it had entered a tunnel that no one had built. The panels were lined like well-behaved pupils waiting to be given something difficult, and Marek felt the old satisfaction when a rail settled true and the bolt seated home and the torque wrench clicked a small sentence of approval. He liked the way Poppy swore at screws in a cheerful tone and the way Jo sang the names of parts as if they were saints. Tom asked questions with the greed of a good apprentice, and Marek heard himself answer in English that would never be invisible but would be useful, making the terms of his knowledge sit down and agree to be international.

On the second day the inverter sulked. Its screen made hieroglyphs with exclamation points that meant very little until you stepped into the smell of it—warm plastic like a child’s toy left near a heater. Marek did what he had done since nineteen: he listened for absence. He crouched under the unit and traced the path of the cables with his eye the way a man traces a sentence with his finger when he loves it too much to wait for his mouth. The fault reported to the world as earth leakage, the sort of moral accusation machines make when they want attention. He thought of Oldřich’s letter and the way the old man had smiled when he wrote the verb entice wrongly and right. He walked the fence line because the day had something else to tell him, and when he placed his palm against a post the ticking that had been a background chorus became a solo. The electric fence would not be turned off because the cows held their opinion of it, and the noise it made was coupling itself into the PV array like a man singing into his own echo. Marek cut the cable tie that had made the fence and the PV run walk side by side. He re-routed with a patience that made Tom itch until Tom watched what the screen did when the wires parted company like amicable exes. When the fault vanished and the numbers began to climb, Matthias put a hand on Marek’s shoulder, a weight not heavy and not light. “You will make us believe in listening,” he said, and the cows flicked their ears in a way that could have been approval or indifference but felt like permission.

The sky became one of his colleagues. It told him, without nonsense, when to pack it in and when to keep driving bolts while he had the light. Clouds tried tricks he had not seen in a city with buildings that edited them, and he learned the different voices rain could have on corrugate. Lunches were pies eaten leaning against tyres, or sandwiches with beetroot that stained the day gloriously. Poppy taught him to love kumara the way you love a song that fills the room without apologizing. Jo shared a jar of bagoong that divided the crew into people who want their mouths to remember meals for hours and people who do not, and Marek became the first kind to prove he was adaptable. They taught him the word chilly bin and laughed at him when he said esky as if he had swallowed a different country, and he stored the laughter as a label that read welcome in a dialect he trusted.

Evenings had a rhythm that did not need to be defended. The share house ate together when the day had gone well and sulked separately when it had not, but sulking here meant turning up the music and chopping onions too fiercely. On his nights to cook, Marek made soups that had no names and too much dill, and Poppy added lime to them in a way that changed their citizenship exactly enough. He sat at the small table in his room and wrote to his mother in the way she had asked: the truth arranged so it would not frighten her on first inspection, lies that were kisses, accounts of birds that were not metaphors. He told her about the magpie that sounded like a cassette rewinding, and about how people used their first names at the supermarket and nobody died of too much friendliness. He told her he had burned the roof of his mouth on a pie and learned a lesson about elegance, and he told her about the thimble in his pocket and how sometimes he wore it under his glove because even here some screws were wicked. In return she wrote using the good pen on paper that smelled like a drawer, sentences that put elbows on the table and made time behave, and she included a folded photograph of him at twelve holding a fish longer than honesty would allow, his face in an expression that was very close to who he had become.

On a Sunday when the work had given them permission to stop, Radim took him to the sea without warning because some things should arrive like men at a surprise party who do not know they are supposed to hide behind the couch. The road turned itself into the last idea the land had before giving up, and the horizon appeared as a straight instruction. They stood in miserable wind and smiled with the kind of happiness that would look ridiculous indoors. Marek took the shell from his pocket and put it back because this was not that shell’s sea, this was another sea with its own dictionary. He watched the backs of waves like strong animals, and he watched the sky practice being enormous without consequence, and he made a deal with himself that he would not become a man who only looked forward because looking is a craft that requires variety. On the way back a pie shop in a town that was all one story sold him something called a steak and cheese and oblivion, and he ate it with the gratitude of an immigrant whose stomach has realized that it does not have to pretend to speak English to be full.

Matthias brought them to his house because to lead men well you should let the place you sleep be seen by those who hold your roof up in weather. It was a low weatherboard with a pohutukawa that promised to become a scandalous red at the right time, and a deck with a table that looked like it had been recovered from a shed after it had proved it deserved the outside. Inside, his mother appeared on a screen because she lived in Freiburg and had opinions about butter. She spoke Czech the way a bell speaks a town, and when she saw Marek she clapped her hands and said that every good Czech boy who goes far must remember how cabbage works or he will die. They talked about what winter means when winter is someone else’s problem, and Matthias watched with the joy of a son showing off two languages he did not invent. He said then, in German that needed no translation, that a man needs a piece of the place he is from for a key and a piece of the place he is going for a door, and Marek filed the sentence into the drawer he keeps for things that are correct and therefore useful.

Not all the work was heroic. Insurance companies required photographs taken at angles that insulted geometry. A bank wanted proof that he existed at a particular address, which meant convincing the landlord to write a letter that flattered both of them. An office in a town that let its main street make decisions through committee wanted him to sit on a chair and be told about tax in terms so apolitical they were almost erotic. He got an IRD number that made him feel like a family had adopted him and put him at the end of a very long table. He opened a bank account where the clerk peered at his passport with the pity reserved for documents that are too beautiful to be trusted, and he signed his name in a way that would hold in this hemisphere. In exchange for a letter that indicated a landlord believed he slept under his roof, he rewired a light in the kitchen so a woman who had lived there since the year he was born could see her book at night without having to argue with a dimmer. She made him a stew that she called soup because naming food is how some people keep from getting old, and he ate it out of a bowl with chips that had learned to count decades.

He did not escape Prague. It came to him through the small screen on the coffee table when a link arrived from Ema with no words and only the shape of her face as the icon. He clicked, and there she was, the pastry shop coaxed into the nation’s living rooms, her mouth saying what she had made it say about leaving the light on while remaining her exact shape. They watched it in the share house, people who had never been to Old Town and who called it by its name in his mouth because he had made it exist for them. Poppy said, “She carries herself like honest furniture,” and Marek nodded because he liked that people could see what he saw and turned the volume up when the street piano appeared like a magic the producer had rehearsed. When the program showed Marek as an accident in a lamppost reflection he flinched and then laughed because he looked less lonely than he had expected. He sent Ema a photograph of the crew’s feet in socks on the low table because he knew it would please her more than another screenshot of her own eyes.

The land had its people and they had their words. On a job that took them to a community hall with a cracked asphalt car park and a roof the wind had learned it could move if it made a plan, an older man with a face that had time in it asked Marek to come look at a lighting problem in the marae down the road. He walked there respectful and impatient, because both energies can be true at once. The carved meeting house held the kind of presence that asks men to stop proving themselves, and the lights along the rafters had been blinking in a way that confused singing. Marek stood in the doorway and waited for the room to tell him how to behave. He was introduced with the word manuhiri, which settled on his shoulders like a polite cloak. The fault was a small thing, a tired connection that had been reinventing itself as a new failure every week. He replaced it with a gesture as gentle as he could make it. An uncle with eyes that had learned not to hurry told him afterward about whakapapa and how everything here is more than itself, and Marek thought of wires as family trees carrying current, and he described to the man the way in Prague he had drawn the bloodlines of buildings and how the old houses knew when you pulled a thread wrong, and they grinned at each other like men who have had the same argument with rooms.

The wind took days for itself and invited them to stay home and pretend other tasks mattered. On one such day Marek went to the beach and found a piece of driftwood that had been disciplined by time into a clean curve that would take a lamp without complaining. He took it home like a criminal and sanded it with a care that turned dust into a kind of weather. He scavenged a length of cord with a cloth cover from a charity shop that had forgotten to be fussy, and he built a light that looked like a small boat that had learned when not to sail. The bulb he used made an ocean of its own on the wall and did not hum because here he had not yet convinced the room to sing. He gave the lamp to Radim’s daughter because she had once drawn him with a head larger than his body and labeled him with a word that meant foreign uncle, and she placed it on her table next to a broken seashell that would not be thrown away, and she asked the lamp to protect her from spiders as if it were a person, and when it flicked its filament on she nodded as if a bargain had been reached.

The days taught him small things about himself. He liked the way the harness creaked when you sat into it and trusted a strap. He learned to tuck the thimble under the glove on steep pitches so the ring and the screw could meet in a way that left dignity on both sides. He learned that his ear for a hum could translate between languages the way kindness can, and that if you stand in the right spot on a roof you can hear the big transformer in the valley below groan a note that says nothing new and everything necessary. He learned to use the word reckon without anyone dying, and the word sweet in a way that made it become a period to a sentence that was not perfect but would do. He learned that he could sit in a kitchen with three other people and not be lonely because loneliness is sometimes an angle and sometimes a fact. At night he wrote to Ema with the sentences she had asked for—pluck and place, no decorations, just the junctions—then he added a line or two that his hands had insisted on writing when he wasn’t looking, and she wrote back with a sentence that obeyed and a sentence that broke rank.

A storm came sideways and pinned a scaffold to its conviction. They were half a roof in, panels stacked like a chorus they were not yet allowed to sing, when the air reversed its habits. The stainless screws in his pocket became a handful of small insults, and Matthias called it because he was a man who knew the difference between courage and arrogance. They climbed down as if parting from a dance partner they loved. In the yard they battened things that had been designed not to fly. The next day, they went up again, and the sky had remembered the contract it has with work, and the day stood where it had been told and they finished the pitch with the quiet joy of men who have negotiated with wind and discovered both are reasonable.

Care packages travel slowly but they travel as if some part of the sender has penned them in their own skin. His mother sent a parcel that contained a pair of wool socks with patterns too optimistic for Prague and a bag of poppy seeds that would probably become contraband at a border if anyone had a sense of humor, and the magnet he had laughed at in her kitchen—TUESDAY IS A LIAR—which he stuck on the share house fridge and which resignedly joined a roster of duties it did not care to alter. He sent back to Kuba a box with candy that did not understand moderation, pineapple lumps that made no excuses, and a bag of chips that tasted of chicken and witchcraft, and he wrote on a notebook page folded into the carton that he had seen a sheep look at him like a man who knows where the bodies are buried and he had felt judged and he would talk about it in more detail over beer that was less sincere than this pie.

He had the habit of collecting old screws from gutters and pockets and corners, and he kept them in a jar that had once held jam. When the jar was half full, he realized the screws had become a history written in a language he read fluently. There were the dulled hex-heads that suggested someone had used the wrong driver in a hurry. There were the bright self-tappers with washers like small hats. There were the tiny brassy ones that did not belong to the roof at all but had fallen from an apologetic weather cock. He poured them out on his table and felt for their threads with a finger so his skin could remember what shapes had been asked from it, and he laughed at himself because this kind of ritual could be used against him in any court.

The calls home were stitched through the weeks like a seam you check for comfort. His mother never called him early because she believed mornings belong to making possible the day, and she never called him late because she had decided on his behalf that men who work roofs should sleep, and in the middle she told him about the price of eggs and the neighbor’s new printer that made her lose faith in modernity. She asked about the plant in Ema’s window as if it were a cousin. Ema sent a photograph of the plant with a leaf in a shape that might have been intentional, and he wrote back that the leaf meant the plant had learned the word for sun. She recorded the sound of the pipes again when the building took a breath before dawn, and he sent back the sound of the wind at the ridge where the field turned itself over. Between them, the cables and the air did their work, and he stopped punishing himself for not being in two rooms at once because martyrdom is not a craft he respects.

There was a night in late spring when the town near their yard held a market in a car park that had reinvented itself without much effort. Strings of lights made it into a photograph that would later justify the cold people endured in their coats. Marek walked with Poppy between stalls selling chutneys that had been invented out of guilt, and jars of relish whose labels were sharper than the flavors, and secondhand tools that had learned patience, and a man selling wooden spoons like weapons. A quiet guitarist sat on the kerb and played a song whose chords he had not entirely earned, and a woman with a single ear stud listened like someone reading the instructions on a medication that will either save her or amuse her. He bought a hand plane with a cracked handle because he wanted to fix something that would fix other things. He bought a punnet of strawberries that were not ready for what his mouth asked of them and he loved them anyway. He watched two boys play chess on a formed milk crate and realized that learning to watch without wanting to move the black knight yourself is a version of becoming a grown man.

When Matthias invited him to take a day off that was not designated by weather but by the need to not become the job, he drove inland on a road that trusted in fences and ditches. He stopped where the map had not commanded and walked into a stand of manuka where the air had encoded itself with a smell that made him believe in medicinal gossip. He sat on a rock shaped by the same hand that had shaped all rocks and opened the thick-paper notebook Ema had given him, and he drew a diagram of his week that was only partly a joke: arrows that went nowhere, boxes labeled with verbs, a small sketch of a cow judging him, a mini-map of knots he had tied without thinking. He wrote, because the page seemed to allow it, I am not becoming someone else. I am becoming a pair of hands that are allowed to be seen by a sky that likes me. He did not send the sentence to anyone because sometimes the thing you write is a spoon that should remain in your own kitchen until guests come who know how to use it.

On a workday that had no bad news scheduled and tried to stick to it, a boy fell. Tom missed the gutter with his boot by the width of a hair and was caught by the line he had clipped to the ridge without pride, and he swung into a beam with a noise like a falling instrument and saw his life unspool for two seconds and then come back. They lowered him to the ground and mouth-laughed the kind of laugh you use when fear needs disguising. Marek had a hand on the rope and felt in his grip the weight of a man who would later become thirty and own a dog. He did not think of Prague or his mother or Ema or even of God; he thought of the way canvas straps bite, and he thought of the knot under his palm, and he thought of how many things hold that are not screws, and later, when the shake had passed, he made Tom do the clipping again until his mouth stopped lying to him. In the yard that evening, Matthias set the first beer down on the trestle as if it were not only a drink but also a verdict, and he said nothing about luck because luck is crude. He said, “We do the dull thing every time, and then we build the beautiful. Not in shops, not in speeches. In order.”

Letters arrived from places he had abandoned. Oldřich wrote in ink that had thought about its color, telling him that the young electrician who had inherited Marek’s notes had called and sworn like a literal sailor, and then had put away a clip correctly, and this was the definition of progress. Radan sent a photograph of the dimmer rack with a new label engraved by a pragmatic man in a shop, the label saying DO NOT INSULT THIS MACHINE and nothing more. Kuba wrote a list of things he wanted to see when he came—sheep, a tree that eats birds, men who say mate without horror—and he asked if there was a specific way to say my friend is here without sounding like a child, and Marek wrote back that the way to do it was to be a child when you needed, and that most men in orange vests are kinder than they want you to believe. His mother sent a clipping from a magazine about a man in Ostrava who had opened a café that served only soups and solutions, and he wrote on a postcard that he did not believe in solutions that came in cups but that he would go with her and we could disapprove together.

There was a thing that wanted to happen between him and a woman who brought them coffee on a job with a deck that behaved better than it looked, and he watched it approach like weather and he did not step toward it because he was busy holding two places that did not like sharing. He did not punish himself for not taking it, and he did not congratulate himself on any principle; he measured simply that he had only two hands and they were already, most days, accounted for. He kept the practice of quiet affection for small objects instead, and he loved the way the inverter hummed when it was not performing, and he loved the way PVC conduit made a small percussive sound when you tapped it with a fingernail to see if it would admit to being correctly glued.

Toward the end of a month whose week count he had lost track of purposefully, Matthias stood atop a slope where the panels faced the stubborn afternoon sun and said, “We will do the big one,” with the calm that makes men not panic. The big one was a field of frames that when finished would look like an argument won and would power a packing shed that had its own religion. He assigned crews with the kind of math that beats back weather, and he put Marek at the axis where the DC strings came together and decided who they were before asking the icons to confess. The days of that build were the days that made his shoulders into an argument about what bodies are for. In the middle of them, the surveyor’s stakes that had seemed ornamental early on revealed their true identity and told them where not to put their feet if they wanted the arrays to admit they belonged to a terrain rather than an idea. There were days of perfect bolts and days where a nut would not accept any thread, perhaps because it had sworn on a private oath to resist, and he learned to laugh without bitterness and then reach for a different nut.

When the big one came on, it did not make a noise a man could brag about. It shifted the air politely and then began to work, and on a screen in a small metal box the numbers became the way a room fills with a warm light when someone who sings opens their mouth. They stood with their caps backwards to keep the sun off their necks and pretended to be bored so they would not look like men who had built a thing and wanted to say it. Jo tapped the box gently like a man who wishes to be alone with his gratitude and then pretends the tap means something technical. Poppy took off her glove and wiped one eye and blamed the wind, and Tom wrote in the dust on the frame with a finger that had not learned grammar. Matthias did not give a speech because the field wanted to keep the thing private. He said only, “Right,” and they left the fence closed behind them and the cows came to see what had been invented for them and decided to eat grass because this is what cows do in the face of human achievement.

On a morning made of clean blue, he walked up a hill above town alone because he had not wanted to tell anyone where he was going. He reached a point where the bay below made an arm and a hand, and the town placed its fingers as neatly as it knew how. A lighthouse on a further point said yes to ships and no to darkness. He sat with the thimble under his thumb because habits become talismans if you let them, and he took the shell out of his pocket because that weight had learned this place and might want to change its advice. He held his phone up and recorded the tui in the cabbage tree below, its metallic chiming reminding him of a toy he had once been denied. He sent it to Ema, and she sent back a file that contained nothing but the sound of her inhaling before a note and it possessed everything a man may need to get down off a hill and go back to work. He thought, without punishing himself for being honest, that he had read the room he had not yet swept and decided it would accept his broom. He stood and walked, and the path under his boots reported that they had had worse men and had survived them, and that this one might be the kind that brings soup and knows which switches to leave alone.The tenth week turned into the tenth kind of morning without asking permission, and Marek realized that counts had stopped being about numbers and had begun to be about textures. The days here wore their edges differently. In the shed yard, a line of harnesses hung like patient bats, the magpie practiced its metallic laugh, and the kettle on the bench turned steam into the first conversation. He had learned enough names that he could call the wind by two and the rain by three. When the uncle from the marae showed him how to introduce himself properly, he wrote the words down carefully as if they might refuse to be remembered without respect. Ko Vltava te awa, he practiced quietly in the ute, because a river that had taught him to look at bridges deserved to be introduced by its own name. Ko Petřín te maunga, he added, and though the hill back home had never pretended to be a mountain, he liked the way the syllables stood up. Ko Praha te kāinga. He paused over canoe, smiled, and said tram in Czech into his own mouth, then decided he would leave that joke at the door and say only that he had arrived by air and by work. The first time he spoke it out loud in the carved meeting house, the words came out like he had held a bird too tightly and then loosened his grip. The old men smiled with their eyes, and the aunties tilted their chins and let the vowels sit in the room. He sat and listened as others stood and described their mountains and rivers, and he felt the way making a map together can turn strangers into neighbors without paper.

Ema’s voice arrived like weather. Some days it came in a quick note recorded between tram stops, the metal and the breath in agreement. Some nights it came as a longer thing where she unfolded the way the studio wanted her to lower the ends of her words to seem softened for a country that worshipped consonants, and how she had smiled and done it once to prove she could and then did not do it again. She was moving along a path that required a bench to sit on from time to time, and she had chosen to put one by the pastry shop and one in a church and one in her living room and one in his pocket. The first time she sent him a draft of a song with her own lyrics in a language she had learned on a bus, he heard the way she had refused to arrange herself into a posture that pleased only the camera. He sent back, because he had been asked for simple sentences, that the line about stairways felt like a handrail in a building he wanted to climb.

The big field began the way all big things begin—with small bolts and a man measuring twice because math is not an enemy but it does not have to be your friend. The ground here had moods, and the frames learned them the way you learn the temper of a table that wobbles only when a certain person sits down. They worked in lines that looked like a parade stopped by a polite police officer. When the electrics started to make sense on paper and then resisted under fingers, Marek felt relieved because the world without small arguments would be unbearable. He taught Tom the way to persuade a connector that had decided it was already married, the way to turn the wrist so that you were asking and not insisting. Tom nodded like a man memorizing dance steps and then nailed it two days later when the wind was making a speech and everyone needed the small victory.

A tremor arrived at four in the morning and borrowed the house without asking. It was not the kind that throws cupboards or breaks friendships. It was the kind that rolled under the bed like a cat you had forgotten you lived with. Marek woke and felt the wall become a ship’s rail and his chest become a deck and for a moment he was both sailor and coastline. The room settled back around his body and he lay there with his hand on the headboard like a man testing if wood had learned a new song. In the yard the next day Poppy showed him the extra screws she had always used for rails because the earth here had opinions, and he felt the bright little satisfaction of men and women who had anticipated a lecture and written their own syllabus. He made a note on a plan in pencil that would confuse someone later and make sense to someone else immediately: do not pretend the ground is a table.

On a Wednesday that felt like a Friday pretending, a call came to the yard while they were halfway through a late lunch with beetroot that had stained everyone into clowns. There was a tangi at the marae and the power had gone unreliable in a way that was not acceptable to the living or the dead. They loaded a generator that had been repaired with — and against — the manufacturer’s advice and drove a road that learned new rules when it rained. The carved house held the air of grief that has decided to be organized. The lights above had begun to strobe like a shared nervous system, and Marek stood quietly in the doorway until his own shoulders had lowered. He traced the fault with his hands in his pockets until he could put them on the right screw without insulting the room. Jo ran cable as if it were the ordinary extension of an ordinary day, and Poppy kept her voice at the precise height that tells a room it has never been abandoned. They set the generator outside where the wind could not argue with the exhaust, and the hum reached in like a polite neighbor and lent the waiata a floor that did not wobble. Later, a woman with a face that had written its own rules pressed a plate of food into his hands that made him feel like he had eaten permission. He sat on the step with his boots on the ground and listened to the way voices hold a person up even after he is gone, and he thought of a workshop in Brno where a man was alive and had taught him to read the room, and he thought of a kitchen in Prague where a woman would not cry because she had decided to cry only when cucumbers fight vinegar.

When the first pay came, it arrived as numbers on a screen and then as a bicycle from a man in a driveway who wanted it to go to someone who would oil the chain. The bike was a slightly too-bright red, the brakes worked with a sense of humor, and the wrong side of the road was kinder than rumor as long as your hand signaled and your eye remembered that cars come like jokes you did not write. He rode to the tide flats on a Sunday when the world was a mirror too honest to be beautiful, and he stood and watched a boy in gumboots become a larger boy in gumboots as he learned that mud can teach you physics in twenty seconds when you misjudge it. A heron near the mouth of the stream made a line of patience agree with air. Marek took his phone and tried to photograph the sound the bird made by not moving and failed, and then sent the failure to Ema and she sent back a photograph of a window that had learned a new kind of light.

He built, because his hands would not sit still even when the rest of him could, a lamp for the hall that had become everyone’s second living room. He found glass insulators in a box in a shed a man was letting retire slowly. He built a spine of driftwood that had learned to forgive. He threaded the wire through holes he drilled with a care that made his jaw sore, and he hung the insulators like extraterrestrial fruit. When it lit, the room did not become a stage; it became a place where people noticed each other’s shoulders. The kids on the floor named the constellations they saw inside the glass and he wrote them down because the sky had too many already. He sent a photo to Radan, who wrote back in a voice that had borrowed civility from a kettle, that the mezzanine now wanted something that looked like this and also that he had finally yelled at the fog machine until it developed a personality that could be lived with.

On the day the work inspector whose beard had lost interest in the rest of his face came to tick boxes and pretend he could smell compliance, Marek found himself proud of the shapes in front of him without that pride needing to wear boots. The man checked and checked and then remarked to Matthias that the array looked like it had been built by people who liked each other, and Matthias made a noise that could be filed under neither yes nor no but looked like a grin from the angle he allowed. That night, because the day had agreed to end with nothing on fire, the house made noodles that could accept three kinds of truth, and they ate on the porch while a neighbor’s lemon tree thought about letting them steal just one.

He posted a small box across the world with a label that would confuse customs but delight the recipient. Inside was a lamp as humble as a cup, made from manuka that had agreed to be sanded honest, with a cloth cord like an old radio’s promise. He packed it with newspaper printed with unfamiliar names, and he wrote on a card that did not try to be art, the simple sentences she had requested: plug, switch, light, bring a corner of this sky to your wall. When Ema sent a photograph of it on the table by her window, the boat-lamp beside it like a sibling from another country, the plants were greener than before in a way that made him trust objects with feelings again. She said it hummed almost not at all, and he admitted he had hidden a ferrite in its body like a second heart.

Kuba threatened to visit the way a storm threatens to keep you inside and then does it for your own good. He sent a message listing, in bullet points that were not responsible, the things he wanted to find: a sheep willing to make eye contact, a tree that eats birds without apology, a bar where the word mate could be applied to him without a court case, about eight pies, a woman who would agree to not date him and laugh anyway. Marek wrote back that the tree existed and the pies did not apologize, that sheep will judge him more fairly than he expects, that the bar was just a room where you would be forced to learn to black your coffee, and that the woman was already living her life safely away from his plans. They began the dance men do with calendars, throwing dates like rocks at a pond and watching the ripples make arguments out of their time zones.

He did not forget the city that had taught him stairs by heart. In a small room behind the office he kept a map of Prague no one else could read. He would trace a tram line with his finger and remember how the corner shop never had change for larger coins and how the barman’s elbow had a permanent bruise and how the shoemaker’s wife watched television with her head tilted to get the truth to come out from the side. His mother sent a recipe written in a hand that believed in flour, and he tried to make the koláče in an oven that had other plans. The first batch came out proud and stupid. Poppy added more heat at the end in a way the recipe disapproved of and saved them into honesty. He ate one that tasted more like home than he could justify and sent the rest to the yard where the dogs saw him coming and pretended they didn’t care about the pastries to preserve their dignity until the last second.

There was a visit to the school where the children had drawn solar panels like fields of giant chocolate bars. They asked questions in a way that made him believe their teachers had not punished curiosity. Can you make a panel from a window? Can the sun run out? Why does wind go that way? Do you wear a cape? He told them about electrons like people in a queue, and he tried not to tell them the part where sometimes you want to push, because pushing queues never helps and grown men forget this as easily as they forget their keys. He showed them a photograph of snow on a roof in Prague and one boy wanted to know if the snow knew it was in Europe. When it was over a girl with hair like a cloud only the bottom half of the pencil had been used to sketch gave him a drawing of a stick man holding a very straight wire, and under it she wrote in careful letters, Thank you for not falling. He folded it into his pocket where the thimble was and felt the paper sit like another small armor.

One morning the ute stopped by a farm gate at the same moment as a man in a hat that had known more days than Marek had. The man asked for a look at the panels like a neighbor who wants to see the baby. They walked the fence line and he told Marek that his father had believed electricity would steal cows’ milk if it was not supervised, and that he had been suspicious of light switches until a woman convinced him that romance was not only possible in candles. Marek liked him the way you like a chair that does not look friendly but holds you in the exact way your back requires. At the trough he reached into the water and came up with a handful of sky and a bolt that had escaped a roof last year and learned a second career. Later, at the ute, he asked where Marek had come from and did not accept Europe as an answer and so Marek said river and hill and city because that is the correct way to do it now. The old man nodded as if a gate had been shut in the right place. “All right then,” he said. “You’ll do.”

Paper arrived again because paper always did. A letter from Immigration that did not apologize for its weight explained the conditions under which a piece of paper could become a longer piece of paper. Matthias put a hand flat on the office desk like a man measuring timber and told him that there would be a place for his name a year from now if the wind did not learn a new trick and the cows did not stage a successful coup. Marek felt the stamp on his passport hum slightly in his pocket like an old transformer, and he smiled because he was less impressed by stamps than by evenings, and he had learned to trust the way a day ends when it has been bold and correct.

He stood once more in the carved house because the crew had been invited to be thanked properly, which is to say with food and words. He had practiced his pepeha again in the ute, the words sitting easier in his mouth the way shoes finally break to your feet. When his turn came he stood and put his hands together for a second because hands remember even when minds do tricks, and he said his river and his hill and his city, and he said his work like it was a name, and he did not dare his joke about the tram, though later he whispered it to a boy who liked trains and they both grinned as if they had learned a crime. An old woman in a jersey that had knitted three people’s lives into itself nodded when he sat down. Later a song rose without anyone needing to command it, and he did not join because there are rooms where joining is consent you have to be invited to sign, and he listened as the voices braided something you could not make with wire. When he stepped outside, the wind was doing what it always did, which was decide, and a small boy ran past holding a stick like a sword and a girl walked past with a stick like a wand, and he let both of them pass into the world without correction.

Toward the end of the day on the big field when the sun had decided to behave dramatically and everyone had decided not to reward it, his phone buzzed with a message from Prague that was only a photograph. Ema’s face in profile, the plant with its green made greener by a lamp that had traveled more kilometers than its cord deserved, a bowl holding fruit and a spoon that was probably his, and in the glass a reflection of a city he could trace with his finger even from here. She had written nothing and said everything. He sent back a picture of the field, the panels like a flock sitting quietly in good weather, the line of men and women in orange and blue who had decided to make a day into a thing you could measure. He wrote nothing and said thank you.

At night, when the house had become less about chatter and more about water and the fat blink of a router, he sat at his small table and made a list that did not promise anything. Teach Tom the knot again, buy more screws in the size everyone always runs out of at the wrong time, call Ma on Thursday because that is when the neighbor visits and pretends she came to return a jar, send Oldřich a photograph of a wire run that would make him nod once and then tighten one small thing. He wrote at the bottom, sweep, because the room he had not yet swept existed in two countries and he owed both of them a broom. He turned off the light that did not hum, and he lay down, and he was tired in the way that is worth its own bed. The house settled like a ship that had found a reasonable harbor. The wind kept being the wind. Somewhere in Prague, a piano existed that could be pushed into a street. Somewhere in the middle of this island, a cow watched stars as if they were telling her a secret simpler than men believed. He slept, and in his sleep the panels drank, the city breathed, and between them a wire glowed in the dark the way a truth does when no one needs it to show off.
