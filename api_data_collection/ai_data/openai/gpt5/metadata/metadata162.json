     "novel_text": "The first time the smell rolled over Ocala, it came in under the live oaks like fog that had learned to rot. It slipped past the white fences and the tall grass and came to crouch in the blue shade behind the barn at Bramble Creek Farm. The horses stomped and rattled their chains. The mare with the star on her forehead struck the door with a neat hoof, once, twice, as if to knock sense into the morning. You could taste it, that smell. It perched at the back of the tongue, swamp and curdled milk and turned earth, wrong in a way that cicadas fell silent for.\n\nMerritt Harker had his boots on the fence rail, chewing a cut of grass and watching the colt\u2019s left ear. The colt flicked it, uneasy. Merritt was uneasy, too, though he didn\u2019t show it. The air in Ocala had moods; he\u2019d grown up listening to the oak canopies gossip with the Spanish moss, listening to the springs talk over limestone in glassy syllables. He knew the plain tastes of thunder and the citrus-knife smell of summer lightning. This was none of those. This was a trespasser wearing a borrowed coat.\n\n\u201cCan you help her or can\u2019t you?\u201d asked Odelia Bramble, crossing her arms. She was round in the same way the earth is round, solid and expecting honest answers. \u201cShe ain\u2019t eaten. She keeps looking at a corner that ain\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nMerritt stood, spit his grass, and patted his pockets until he found the handkerchief he\u2019d tied knots in last night. It wasn\u2019t cotton, not really. It was horsehair and citrus peel and three threads tugged from his grandmother\u2019s prayer shawl when she wasn\u2019t looking back when he was nine. He\u2019d soaked the handkerchief in a jar of rain from the last storm that had cracked the sky and made the windows look inward.\n\n\u201cI can help,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not her that needs it. Something came through, took a seat behind her eyes. Showed her teeth.\u201d\n\nOdelia sucked her teeth. \u201cSomething like what?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething that eats stink and grows on it,\u201d Merritt said. He spoke to the horse, softer. \u201cEasy, star-girl. We\u2019re just going to wash your morning.\u201d\n\nMerritt had a way with things that didn\u2019t have enough words to defend themselves. He could put his hand on a fence-post and hear the rain talk in the grain. He could look at footprints and tell if they\u2019d been made by a liar. He had, as he once told a drunk at the Fox and Oak, \u201ca partcilar set of skills,\u201d and then stifled a laugh because he loved when words went a little crossways. He could pull curses like splinters and grind them under his heel. He could make a room remember who it belonged to. He could braid a ward into a whip and crack it across a dark doorway so fast a tragedy would forget to step through. He\u2019d done all right with those skills. Enough to keep the lights on in his rented place south of the old Silver Springs park, beneath a live oak that wore moss like a veil and seemed to lean down to listen whenever he spoke.\n\nHe tied one knot in the handkerchief under the mare\u2019s left eye, humming something old. Something his mother had hummed when she shelled peas, not because it was magic but because it remembered a tune that had no words and no room for fear. He blew across the knot and it loosened, unwinding into the air and making it shred. The smell there was layered: horse sweat, hay, metal, manure. And something else that tried to perch. He cut that elsewhere with the edge of his name. Names, if you knew how, could be filed down to blades thin enough to pass through air and leave only the thing that didn\u2019t belong, naked and blinking.\n\nThe mare calmed. Her ear went easy. Odelia watched the steam of breath that rose in the morning and didn\u2019t say a word until the mare nudged Merritt\u2019s shoulder like they were cousins who hadn\u2019t fought in a long time.\n\n\u201cYou do this for folks in Gainesville?\u201d she asked, still squinting at a corner that Merritt had put right.\n\n\u201cI do it for folks who ask,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd some who don\u2019t ask, if things get loud enough.\u201d He untied the handkerchief and retied it, different knots. He would deal with the smell when he had more to go on. For now: playlist to ease a horse. Old songs. The kind with clapping built in.\n\nHe took his pay in cash and in a jar of peaches that tasted like sunset had signed them by hand. He\u2019d learned long ago that taking pay only in bills made different kinds of debt stick to you; peaches weren\u2019t tracked by the same bookkeeper.\n\nOn his way out, Merritt paused. The smell, that rot you could taste, wasn\u2019t just lingering. It was repointing. He could feel it like a tight thread tugged between his ribs and the northwest corner of the farm, where a sinkhole had yawned open ten years back and Odelia had filled it with broken concrete, shells, and prayers.\n\n\u201cYou had anyone come up the road a few hours ago?\u201d he asked. \u201cTall fella, perhaps, hat held together with safety pins, walks like he\u2019s got one foot in a well? Smells like a closet you forgot.\u201d\n\nOdelia blinked. \u201cNot that I saw. But we been getting calls. Mason from up off 441 says his dogs won\u2019t go under the house. Deputy Lyle came by around dawn. Said folks near Juniper were complaining. Something wrong with the air.\u201d\n\nMerritt hummed under his breath. Not a song this time. A map. He tasted how the smell ran, pooling in low places, climbing the pines like a cold thought, raking its fingers along the white fences. It was coming from the direction of the springs. Not the tourist part with glass-bottom boats and wedding pictures, but the old side, where the limestone remembered an older river that had gone underground and was still learning to be dark.\n\nHe climbed into his truck. It had a new battery and an old soul. It had the kind of dashboard that could hold a handful of marbles through a sharp turn without dropping one. He\u2019d scratched sigils into the steering wheel with his thumbnail and then rubbed them smooth with orange oil until they looked like ordinary scratches. He didn\u2019t like to look like anything other than ordinary, at least at first glance. Ordinary got you in the door. After that you could do what was needed.\n\nWhen he turned onto the road and the oaks made their tunnel over him, he felt the town bend. There was a kind of groan that came out of Ocala when something old in it decided to wake up. Springs didn\u2019t like to be poked. The forest neither. Merritt rolled down the windows and let the air talk to him. It spoke in frogs and in crows and in the hush that happens when wild pigs are somewhere you can\u2019t see but that every root in the area knows about.\n\nHalf a mile down, he saw Tansy Leon on her porch, curling her hair with a spoon because she said irons made her think of scars. Tansy had a baby on her hip and an opinion in the other hand, most days. Today she had a phone and a frown. She flagged him down with the phone.\n\n\u201cMerritt. You got your bag?\u201d she asked. \u201cCause I call you when I hear dead bells. There were three at four a.m. I don\u2019t know who rung \u2019em, but I heard \u2019em. Also, don\u2019t shut your truck off. It won\u2019t start back. Merciful Lord, something stinks.\u201d\n\nHe kept the engine running. \u201cYou take my advice two days out of the month, and I never know which two. What bells?\u201d\n\n\u201cI said dead bells. Like when Momma\u2019s folks used to set a bell over a body in case it was only mostly gone and not all gone, and the wind would jingle it to keep God\u2019s attention from wandering. Don\u2019t look at me like that. I hear what I hear. I got ears like a hound that went to finishing school.\u201d\n\nMerritt nodded. He did not hear dead bells like Tansy did, but he believed her when she said the air had worn mourning clothes for a minute. \u201cYou seen anything off?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly that.\u201d Tansy pointed across the road, where a stain dark as tea was spreading under the ditch water. The ditch was full as always, little creek\u2019s worth of runoff that never fully receded no matter how much the city pretended it maintained the drains. The stain fought the sun. It wanted the shade. It wanted to not dry.\n\nMerritt knelt. He pulled his pocket knife and a strip of orange rind from the bag on the passenger seat and cut the rind into curls. He dropped one into the ditch. It floated, then shivered, then sank, as if something under it had tasted and decided it wasn\u2019t the meal it wanted but would eat it out of principle. The ditch burped. Tansy made a face.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell me that\u2019s normal,\u201d she said. The baby on her hip pawed at her shirt and then reached a chubby hand toward Merritt\u2019s curls of orange like he wanted to eat the scent.\n\n\u201cNormal is a coat,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cYou can turn it inside out and it\u2019s still a coat. This is not a coat.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou talk in riddles \u2018cause you think it makes you mysterious.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd because I know how to keep myself entertained.\u201d He stood and put the knife in his pocket. His fingers smelled like his grandmother\u2019s kitchen. His shoulders smelled like the ditch now, and he didn\u2019t like it.\n\nTansy wiped the baby\u2019s chin. \u201cI seen Deputy Lyle motor past just now. He had his windows up and his shoulders up. He said Mayor Dobbins wants you to come by if you get a chance because the old fountains at the square were bubbling something green. You got time for the mayor?\u201d\n\n\u201cI got time for the springs,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cIf Dobbins is on the way, he\u2019s on the way. If he\u2019s not, he can wait with his green bubbles and drink coffee until the world rights itself or doesn\u2019t. You go in, Tansy. Keep the baby high, if you know what I mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn my hip?\u201d She narrowed her eyes, then laughed, then shooed him with the spoon. \u201cGet on, go.\u201d\n\nHe drove toward the forest. He passed the sign for the taxidermist that had been there since his father was young and probably before. He passed a yard sale where someone had set out a line of mismatched chairs like they were expecting a wedding that only ghosts had RSVP\u2019d to. The smell followed, not just in the ditch but in the lay of the day. It made him think of drains. It made him think of damp cardboard and the sour behind a fridge when the seal goes. It made him think of a man he\u2019d once unseated from a soiled throne behind the old cannery\u2014warlock, yes, but more importantly a coward that had learned a trick he shouldn\u2019t have and refused to forget it. That man hadn\u2019t smelled, not like this. He\u2019d smelled like cheap gin and cheaper perfume and the nickel smell of guilt. This was worse.\n\nBy the time he reached the anonymous part of the forest where the road gave up being proper and turned into sand and spitting ruts, the smell was everywhere. He pulled off, turned off the engine despite Tansy\u2019s prophecy, and climbed out with his bag. The bag was country doctor old: leather scabbed where it had been taken into scrub too many times, strap replaced, clasp mended with a coin and a prayer and a little nail. Inside were the tools of his living: chalk in a tin, salt in a jar, thorn in a twist of flannel, a length of blue rope, a piece of mirror whose back had been scratched. A horseshoe nail, too, bent into a question mark. A silver quarter with a hole drilled and a red string through it. A book whose pages looked like Wyoming but smelled like wet wood.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t alone. The scrub-jays noticed him first, bright and rude. Then a hunter\u2019s orange hat slipped between palmettos and came back into view with Lyle\u2019s head under it.\n\n\u201cMayor says you should see this,\u201d Lyle said, not stepping out of the brush until Merritt made the sign that meant I\u2019m myself and not someone else wearing me. Lyle had learned, after that thing with the mimics, not to take even easy things as given.\n\n\u201cI think I already am seeing it,\u201d Merritt said, and pointed to the spring. It should have been white-blue, clear to the bottom, water rolling up as if the earth breathed and could not keep that breath in. It was blue, sure, but a bruised blue, and the rocks at the mouth were furred with a wet grey that moved when the sun moved. Worse: there was a slick on the water, as if someone had poured old soup into it, and it made a slow wheel turn where it shouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI went down to do a pull,\u201d Lyle said. \u201cJust a dip, you know, to say my hellos. The scooters and the trout were skittering. I ain\u2019t seen them skitter. Then the old woman under there\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one who sings and doesn\u2019t need air.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe told me to go. \u2018Go, boy,\u2019 she said, like she was my buelah. I went,\u201d Lyle said with a small shrug and a big seriousness. \u201cI figured you\u2019d know where to put your hands.\u201d\n\nMerritt put his hands in his pockets and let the springs talk to them. He listened to the limestone explain. He listened to the rush under the rush, the underground dark river that had learned to be white at the lip. There was something in the line, something that had been coaxed from beneath where they were and led to the light with a chain made of stink. That chain had links like injuries, and old ones at that.\n\n\u201cSomebody\u2019s calling up the under,\u201d Merritt said. His mouth felt dry. \u201cNot just a little, either. Enough to lace it into town. Enough to let it wear the air like a glove.\u201d\n\nLyle scratched his chin. \u201cThat\u2019s not a usual Tuesday.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Merritt bent. He unscrewed his jar of salt and flung a bright arc of it into the spring and watched the arcs fall. They hit the slick and did not dissolve. They made a shape, a two-handed shape, then that shape inverted itself in a way that said, Forgive me. He did not forgive.\n\n\u201cYou recognize it?\u201d Lyle asked, trying not to breathe. His breath came shallow through his mouth.\n\nMerritt did, but the recognizing made his tongue want to swear and his hands want to close into fists over nothing. The shape was a calling sign, unlicensed and wrong. Only two in the county would dare use it, because the last time someone had, he had woken in a creek downstream of his life and never found the bank again. Merritt had sworn a thing then. Merritt had gone to his mentor and said, Give me the thread, I\u2019ll track it. And he had tracked it. He had not found the hands.\n\n\u201cVespur Rankin,\u201d he said, careful to not say it to the water. He said it to the dirt, where he trusted the ants not to carry it to the wrong ears. \u201cOf all the deadbeat mages, he stinks most. Literally.\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard of him. He the one lives out by the old bottle dump, the one smells like skunk that read the Bible backward?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s him. He doesn\u2019t live anywhere that will have him long,\u201d Merritt said. He put the salt up and got out the blue rope. He wet the rope, breathed into it, and snapped it. It cracked, and the crack ran out over the spring and into the slick and made a small cut that wept clear. \u201cHe can hitch his shadow to a possum and sleep in a ditch. He can make a baby stop crying by reminding it how pain is expensive. He can do ten ugly things you can think of and ten you can\u2019t. But most of all he can hide in a place you don\u2019t want to put your hand in. He\u2019s good at that. He\u2019s proud of that. He should not be proud of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know him?\u201d Lyle watched the rope like it was a snake that might decide not to be a rope in a minute.\n\nMerritt tied a knot and put it in his pocket, let the knot eat at the slick and saw it win a small patch that gleamed like a clean plate. \u201cI was with someone who unmade what he thought he\u2019d made,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cHe isn\u2019t fond of me. I\u2019m less fond of him. This smell is his cologne. We need to expect him in town.\u201d\n\nLyle swore under his breath, the kind of swear that might velcro itself to a kid passing by if you weren\u2019t careful. \u201cThe mayor is going to not like this. He doesn\u2019t like to use your name in a meeting. He says it makes him sneeze.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe can sneeze,\u201d Merritt said, and turned toward the truck. \u201cI got to make a ring at home, and then I\u2019ll come by the square.\u201d\n\nLyle grabbed his sleeve. \u201cMerritt. Be careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI usually am.\u201d He lied because he didn\u2019t know how to be careful when Vespur was the topic. You\u2019re careful around fire. This was not fire. This was the other thing.\n\nThe truck started because he asked it nicely. He drove with the windows down in spite of the smell that was learning to love the cab. He drove past his house\u2014the live oak bending, the wind chimes made of old spoons, the bottle tree clinking like laughter\u2014and he would have driven past his drive, but something in the way the light fell on his windows made him pull in. Someone had been there. The lock on the side door looked right but had a new scratch. The dust on the sill had a little checkmark in it. There were footprints in the sugar sand by the steps. He bent and looked. Two sets: one that was his, one that was a flatter boot and pointed its toes in like an apology. The apology was sarcastic.\n\nHe wanted to kick the door in. He did not. He put his palm flat against it and reminded it whose it was. The door\u2019s grain shivered. It sighed. It unlatched. He stepped in and knew immediately: something had leaned on his walls. The house held heat like a breath under a quilt, but the heat here had a cavity in it where a cold thing had sat.\n\n\u201cVespur,\u201d he said, not in a prayer voice.\n\nThey always want you to say their names. He didn\u2019t say it again. He went room by room and saw his things, where he had left them. The book on the table with a chapter about rope trickery and how not to. The jar of pennies. The bowl with the starfish in it. The old dog collar with no dog anymore. None of it moved much. Except in the kitchen, where a drawer had been opened and shut, and in the back room where he kept the box that his mother had saved from her mother. The box had a seam. It had been opened and shut with a care that was almost insulting, as if to say, I could have been clumsy but chose not to, because cruelty is better when it is neat.\n\nHe put his hand on the box and felt the past warm under his skin. The box held the little name-threads of his family. He kept them there not because he wanted to use them; he kept them because you don\u2019t leave names around where a rat could learn the shape of them. Inside, neat as he had left them, were threads. Only one was missing, and that one was grey-blue, like Sunday morning church shirts, like the river at dusk. His father\u2019s name.\n\nMerritt\u2019s teeth clicked. He couldn\u2019t help it. A sound came out of him that sounded like a saw that had bit into a nail. That was Vespur\u2019s trick, then. Not a simple theft, but a smart one. With a name like that in his pocket, Vespur could walk into Merritt\u2019s circles, foot on the rug, and the house itself would decide to be a good host. He could set his stink down and it would not be thrown outside. He could stand in the square and make a story that sounded like Merritt\u2019s father telling you the bees are swarming and to bring the sheets and the pot. And people would believe. Not because they were fools. Names are coats. They carry the smell of their owner.\n\n\u201cDirty,\u201d Merritt said. He set the box down with very careful hands. He knew how to cuss without words: he changed three tiny things in four small corners of that room and the house got ready to make blood cost extra. He tried not to stumble on the thought of his father, of the smell of his shirt, of the way he had taught Merritt to tie knots and to untie them, too.\n\nHis phone buzzed in his pocket. Aunt Lydie. He answered. \u201cI know,\u201d he said, because she would be calling because her teeth had ached or the picture of her dead sister had turned its back in the frame.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I know,\u201d she said. Her voice was a rainbow of warnings. \u201cYou come to me now. You bring your hands and your hat. He\u2019s out. He\u2019s out and on your road.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing his tracks,\u201d Merritt said. He shut the drawer the way you shut a casket. \u201cHe took Dad\u2019s name.\u201d\n\nSilence, then a sound like a fist in a drawer. \u201cHe did not.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did.\u201d He watched the window. He could feel the shade outside rearrange itself, trying on different shapes. \u201cI\u2019ll come, but I have to swing by the square. The mayor\u2019s fountains are doing tricks.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou bring me a handful of that trick,\u201d Aunt Lydie said, and hung up because she did not believe in goodbye until after you were back and had had coffee.\n\nHe did not have to go to the square to know the trick had been there. He could smell that cheap theater even with the good old big smell of springs over it. But he went, because he understood that he had to be seen in the places Vespur wanted him to be seen, to draw out the further trick. The square was crowded the way a lawn is crowded before a storm\u2014people close, eyes skyward. Mayor Dobbins was red in the face and trying to pretend he wasn\u2019t and had never been embarrassed. He saw Merritt and did the thing he did where he looked at the space to the left of Merritt\u2019s ear.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s my man,\u201d Dobbins called, smiling with his mouth and not his eyes. \u201cYou see to it, now. Someone dropped a dye in the fountain, a child\u2019s prank, a college boy\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou smell that, Mayor?\u201d Merritt asked, moving around the fountain, hand low, looking. The green wasn\u2019t dye. He could see little hell seeds turning in it like burrs under a dog\u2019s skin. He made a small knot and flicked it into the water. It sank, burst, turned those seeds to paper. People clapped because people like to clap when something they could not do has been done, even a little. \u201cGot a prankster that\u2019s more than a boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not need your commentary,\u201d Dobbins said, which meant he felt powerless. \u201cYou need me to sign something? To authorize? Because if we have to close the square\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should close the square,\u201d Merritt said, and felt the next part happen. He didn\u2019t see Vespur, because Vespur was the kind to sit in a tree in the dark under a coat of mold and eat an orange with the mold still on it, and then lick his fingers. He felt Vespur\u2019s grin in the way the air leaned. He saw Deputy Lyle at the edge of the crowd flinch and reach instinctively toward the gun he wasn\u2019t going to use. He saw Tansy across the way move the baby so its nose was stuffed tight against her shirt because she trusted her body to do what it needed without being told. He saw Rosa Crutchfield, who ran the nursery by the highway, put her hand in her purse and pull out a little bag of salt she carried for luck and for eggs. She looked at him and nodded because she knew the shape of a day going bad and would put her shoulder to it if he needed.\n\nThen the voice rolled out. It was an old voice. Not Vespur\u2019s. It was older and worn in all the spots where laughter had sat and where yelling had cracked it. Merritt\u2019s father\u2019s voice, not exact but close enough that if you weren\u2019t looking for wrong you\u2019d lean into it.\n\n\u201cBoy,\u201d said the voice, and Merritt almost lifted his head. It came from the stone phone box by the courthouse where they had put a tourist map and a pamphlet about the springs. The box rattled. \u201cBoy, you get yourself home and bring the chain. I told you. You don\u2019t go to the square when the drains sing. You don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\nMerritt steadied. He put his hand on the fountain stone and let the cool go up his arm. Vespur wanted him to run. Vespur wanted to pick him up and put him down and watch him hop. Vespur loved a dance if the steps were all knives.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said, because people were looking at the phone box and then looking at him like maybe he\u2019d left a door open. \u201cDon\u2019t hear that without seeing the mouth.\u201d\n\nSomeone in the crowd said, \u201cIt\u2019s his daddy. It sounds like.\u201d Someone else put a hand to their own mouth as if to keep the words from coming out and getting used.\n\nThen the other part of the trick, the dirtier part. Merritt smelled smoke before he saw it. He pictured his house with the moss and the spoons and the bottle tree and it shivered inside his chest. There was smoke indexing into the sky from his side of town, thin and black and straight. Vespur was not lighting it big; he was trying to keep it neat. He was a neat liar. He was burning something that would make not a blaze but a point.\n\n\u201cMerritt,\u201d Lyle said at his shoulder, low. \u201cYou see?\u201d\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d Merritt said. He should run. Vespur wanted that. He should not. Vespur wanted that more.\n\nHe made an oval in the air with his forefinger and then broke it with his thumb. The turn loosened just enough of the crowd\u2019s staring that they breathed again and started to mill. Milling was safer than staring. He looked at Rosa and she gave him one hundred percent of her attention in the small way he had taught her for times when you didn\u2019t have time to fuss. \u201cGo to my house,\u201d he said, not moving his lips much. \u201cDon\u2019t go inside. Look like you\u2019re just admiring the moss. Tell me with your left hand what you see.\u201d\n\nRosa nodded like he had asked her if she\u2019d water his basil. She drifted off, a woman with no hurry, though her bones knew she should.\n\nDobbins caught Merritt by the elbow then, new-style gentry grip. \u201cI do not like you meddling, Mr. Harker. But if you do, do it quietly. Folks are jumpy.\u201d\n\n\u201cFolks are smart,\u201d Merritt said, pulling his arm back without being rude and without not being rude. He moved toward the courthouse steps so he could have his back to granite while he thought. The dirty trick had two blades: the father-voice and the smoke. A third blade was likely. He scanned faces. People liked to look like people when they were people, and things in them that weren\u2019t liked to pull at the corners of the mouth like a puppet\u2019s string. He watched. He saw nothing obvious.\n\nThen his phone buzzed in his pocket again and Rosa\u2019s name and three words: \u201cdoor open not yours.\u201d Something clicked in him. He saw the lock without looking at it. He saw his back room the way you remember your teeth. The door was open now. It had been closed when he left. He pushed air toward it and got back the feeling of something sitting on his bed. He smelled it: not only Vespur\u2019s rot but a softer stink, like old milk in a warm car, skin with fever, a wool blanket washed and never fully dried.\n\nHe went cold enough that the sun felt like a suggestion. Vespur had not just stolen and lit and waggled. Vespur had put a thing in Merritt\u2019s house. Vespur had made himself host and then invited sickness.\n\nLyle moved with him when he moved. \u201cYou better tell me if I need a warrant. I mean, I shouldn\u2019t need. Your place is your place, but if I come in\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t coming in,\u201d Merritt said, sliding in by the old truck without looking like he was running. \u201cIf I don\u2019t come back in two hours, go to Aunt Lydie\u2019s. She\u2019ll tell you what to do. Don\u2019t try to be the hero. That job\u2019s taken. No offense.\u201d\n\nLyle almost smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll be the deputy. I know how to do that.\u201d\n\nHe drove. He drove in that non-running way that kept his shoulders down and his eyes wide. He drove with his foot light and his hands steady and the urge in his belly to stomp and to break and to fling. He was good at not flinging when he had to be. It was one of the particular things he could do: swallow his own heat so he didn\u2019t set traps you couldn\u2019t spring without breaking your own ankle.\n\nWhen he turned down his road, the smoke was thinner than a promise. Rosa was on the grass, bent over a patch of oxalis like she had suddenly found it fascinating. She had her left hand on her right elbow. That meant one person, inside, left side. She wore her hair up and her face steady. She didn\u2019t look at him, which meant there was an eye in his windows and she wouldn\u2019t tip it.\n\nHe parked three houses down and walked back. The bottle tree chimed like a story about to end wrong because the wind knew the plot twist before the reader. On his porch were small marks in pig fat, one on each step, neat coins of it. He didn\u2019t step on them. They would slide his feet and make his face kiss wood. He stepped over. He reached down and smudged one with two fingers and smelled the gravewater in it. Good, he thought distantly, a traditional boy. Vespur liked the old mess because it looked like making. It looked like he\u2019d read something. It made him feel complete. He was always missing pieces.\n\nThe side door was open. He stood in the threshold and nearly gagged. The smell had changed. It had bloomed. It was not just rot now; it was hotel carpet that had never had enough sun, old shoes with no socks, onions fried and left out, the ghost of a hundred laundries. And under it, a human smell that he knew so well he almost dropped.\n\n\u201cDad?\u201d he said, because the voice had been used and the name had been stolen and Vespur had expected him to say it in a hurt way. It came out flat. It came out like a test. The thing on the bed moved.\n\nIt was a man\u2019s shape. Matter-of-fact, if you didn\u2019t look too close. If you looked close, the edging was wrong. The shrug of the shoulder was a costume\u2019s shrug. The hand had too many lines and not enough. The face was a smear of features that tried to be a face he knew and almost succeeded until the blink was backward. It smelled like a man who\u2019d been ill and kept trying to get better and never did.\n\n\u201cBoy,\u201d said the thing, and the voice was the voice that had made him hammer straight and pull his nails and check his knots. \u201cYou let me up. This bed\u2019s too soft. You brought something in the house. You track dirt like a mule.\u201d\n\n\u201cVespur,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cYou\u2019re in my house.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat I am,\u201d said another voice, the real one, from the kitchen doorway where the light made it look like moss had gotten up and grown a man. Vespur Rankin stepped out, full, and he was the smell. He carried a little bag that had probably held sugar once, and he had a grin like he\u2019d put on a jewel that had belonged to someone else in a town where people knew who had had what. He wore a coat with patches and the patches didn\u2019t match. He had eyes that were the color of pond water when the pond is too round and has had no wind. \u201cAnd you\u2019re out of luck.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would argue that,\u201d Merritt said. He did not take his eyes off the thing trying to be his father. \u201cYou took a name that was not yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou put it in a box like hams,\u201d Vespur said, as if explaining a law of nature. \u201cA name is a river. It runs or it goes sour. I saved it from going sour. Don\u2019t look at me like that. Besides, it was in the trees. It was low-hanging. I ain\u2019t a saint, Merritt. I\u2019m not even a good sinner. I do the work that needs doing in this county and nobody thanks me. They say, Vespur, you smell. Vespur, you take a bath. Vespur, we can\u2019t have you at the homecoming \u2018cause the children retched last time. You believe that? Children. They born in blood and cry at water and they cry at me? Why?\u201d He lifted his arms slightly and the smell lifted with them and made the room grow smaller. \u201cThat\u2019s politeness for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the children are wiser than their folks,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cI think the children should run the courts some days. What did you call up in my springs?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a thing,\u201d Vespur said, proud of the lie and proud of the truth tucked in it. \u201cI opened a little mouth. I said, Sing for us. Folks are bored, Merritt. They\u2019re tired of being made safe. Safety\u2019s a dull god. I brought the party. And I brought your daddy to spend time. You were never good at that.\u201d\n\nMerritt didn\u2019t look at the smear on his bed. He didn\u2019t look at the way his own hands were wanting to shake. He looked at the pig fat marks, the neatness of the trick: the stink to drive him, the voice to stab him, the smoke to split him. He looked at Vespur\u2019s little bag. He looked at the floor.\n\n\u201cYou want to take a swing,\u201d Vespur said, kindly. \u201cYou keep all that mean folded like shirts and now you want to wrinkle it. Go on. Swing. Be uncareful.\u201d\n\nMerritt didn\u2019t swing. He took one step to the left and one step to the right and then he did the small rude thing of taking a little, useless-seeming object\u2014a bottle opener in the shape of a marlin\u2014from the counter and flipping it so it spun on the table and tapped the table\u2019s four corners, ping, ping, ping, ping. The house breathed. It whispered. The thing on the bed flinched like paper near a flame.\n\n\u201cYou used my father to get in,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cThat\u2019ll cost you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI used a vowel on a string to knock on your door,\u201d Vespur said, bored with the moral shape of the conversation. \u201cAnd the door opened. That\u2019s physics. You can\u2019t be mad at physics.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou played a dirty trick,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cIt works here. In front of me. It won\u2019t work out there. You can\u2019t get this close to anyone else without them learning the smell. You can\u2019t wear this long. You can\u2019t usually even be on the same side of a room as yourself without your stomach going wrong. You\u2019re good at getting in, Vespur. You\u2019re terrible at staying.\u201d\n\nVespur smiled in a sad way, like Merritt had said a true thing and spoiled it by knowing he was right. \u201cI don\u2019t need to stay,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to break a few of your tools. I need to seed a little mess. And I need to get somewhere else by night so as to do the same. You\u2019re the one who always thinks you got to fix the whole state by supper. How\u2019s that working?\u201d\n\nHe lifted the little bag and shook it. The sound was like beads and pennies. Merritt recognized the clink. Not coins. Teeth. He smelled the grave in the pig fat again and knew. Vespur had brought dead names to fling like water. He had brought someone else\u2019s poor, gone words to push into Merritt\u2019s corners. That was the other blade. He was going to gum up the house. He was going to make it stutter.\n\nMerritt was going to stop him. That was how this worked. He took a breath and let his particular set of skills measure the room. He made the place know his back. He made it so Vespur\u2019s left foot was a little heavier than he thought it should be and would come down a fraction late. He made the thing on his bed itch where it could not scratch. He drew a circle with an orange peel in his pocket and it made the air taste like day. He reached for the bit of mirror in his bag and held it so it caught the kitchen doorway light and made two small knives of it. He did the work. He loved to do the work well.\n\nAnd then the dirty trick inside the dirty trick. Vespur stepped back, not forward. He snapped his fingers and his stink rose, cooking off like he had turned on a burner. The room grew into heat and then slickness, and the slickness was a sound, and the sound was a voice not his father\u2019s and not Vespur\u2019s. It was a little voice. It was the baby from Tansy\u2019s hip, keening, not from hunger but from fear. It cut the room like a wire. It made Merritt unmake his circle by accident. It made him move.\n\nHe knew the trick even as he did what the trick wanted\u2014because he was not a god, and the cry of a baby is the needle in any good man\u2019s wrist. He broke toward the door. Vespur laughed, a short bark that didn\u2019t care about elegance. \u201cRun,\u201d he said, satisfied.\n\nMerritt came out on the porch where the bottle tree had gone quiet because the air had put its fingers in its mouth to listen. Rosa wasn\u2019t there. She had done what she was supposed to; she had drifted, invisible. Across the road, under the oak in his neighbor\u2019s yard, a stroller sat. Empty. Spun a little by the suggestion of wind and by the suggestion of hands that weren\u2019t. The baby noise came from behind it. He saw the shape in the shade and moved faster than a man who didn\u2019t know how to catch a lie thrown at his head. He went to snatch the baby up and hand it back to a world that was behaving like a person bumping their shin. His feet hit pig fat. He went down hard. He had not seen Vespur\u2019s neat little coin on that step, down under the rail, because he had exited by the front and not the side. He\u2019d stepped over those ones. He had not accounted for the kindness of Vespur, who never used one trick when three would braid so pretty.\n\nHe hit with his shoulder and tasted pennies. He saw a shadow over him and rolled, but not fast enough, because his house had a moment of doubt about whose hand was more honest. He jammed his elbow into a board and it bit him and he had blood on his fingers and the smell wrapped his head like a wet rag.\n\nVespur stepped into the sun, smiling like a man who knows the song and can\u2019t help but sing. He held up the little bag and shook it again and the teeth laughed. The laugh put a rope around Merritt\u2019s breath and tugged.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the upper hand, boy,\u201d Vespur said, pleased to be neat. \u201cDirty hands, clean work. Don\u2019t get up too quick. You\u2019ll fall again.\u201d He tossed the bag. It hit the porch and broke and the names came out and went skittering along the boards, poor things. The baby\u2019s cry cut off like a switch. It hadn\u2019t been the baby. It had been a jar in his throat, shaken.\n\nMerritt struggled up on one knee. He felt his house decide. It decided too slow. It had to, with dead names sliding across its skin. He put his fingers against the porch to tell it a joke it liked, the one about the man whose pockets were full of soot, and the porch laughed and shook the coins of pig fat loose. They skittered off like snails. He could move now. He stood, and the world stood with him, though Vespur had got what he had come to get: a picture, printed in every neighbor\u2019s mind, of Merritt on his own porch with stink and with blood and with a man on his bed that looked like something he shouldn\u2019t let in. Vespur had set the day to his tune.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll unmake it,\u201d Merritt said calmly, though calm was a thing he was ironing with both hands. \u201cI\u2019ll take your teeth and make a wind chime that keeps you out of every door you ever liked.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll chase,\u201d Vespur said, and took his own advice. He didn\u2019t leave by the road. He slipped into the shade under the oak as if it had a trapdoor for him and dropped, or seemed to. The smell went with him like a cape and then it didn\u2019t, because he could fold it when he wanted and hide. He left the room and the day and the county laughing.\n\nRosa appeared then, arm out like she had caught a ghost by the sleeve and was making sure it didn\u2019t break anything on the way out. \u201cHe put whispers under your rugs,\u201d she said. \u201cI heard \u2018em. They said your name wrong like my granny did when she had the fever.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the rugs outside and beat them until they confess,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cYou ought to go to Lydie\u2019s. Tell her he took Dad\u2019s name. Tell her he put hands in my house made of teeth. Tell her he used Tansy\u2019s boy to pull me. It wasn\u2019t him, but she\u2019ll want to count arms anyway.\u201d\n\nRosa nodded, her mouth a straight line. \u201cYou going to go after him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was going to go after him yesterday,\u201d Merritt said. He went inside and picked up the marlin bottle opener from where it had spun across the table. He put it in his pocket so he\u2019d have something to hold that had done what he\u2019d asked of it. He looked at the bed and at the smear that was no father of his but a shape that said father like a preacher who had never had a child. He lifted his hand and the bed groaned and the shape slid off and hit the floor like laundry. He opened the back door and shoveled it out with the edge of his name. The yard took it. The oak bent down and sniffed and made a sound of disgust and then lifted back as if unwilling to get involved in a mess that would take more than a day.\n\nHe washed his hands. He washed his face. He reknotted his handkerchief. He put his bag on his shoulder and the house shifted in its heart so it could watch the door for him. He said, \u201cI\u2019ll come back,\u201d because he meant to.\n\nHe stepped onto the porch again and the heat had grown since morning. The air stacked in layers. Somewhere in the fanning green, a hawk called and a rabbit decided to be elsewhere. He could feel Vespur\u2019s direction like a bruise that tingles when rain\u2019s coming. Toward the bottle dump by the old tracks. Toward the sinkholes where kids went to be alone and sometimes were. Toward the forest\u2019s wrong.\n\nHe set out, knuckles still stinging, anger sharp as lemon in the mouth. He would not chase like a dog; he would track like a man. He would bring a rope that knew how to tie itself to a lie. He would take the stink and turn it out like a coat hung inside a door where the sun could get at it. He would not be careful; he would be precise. He could do that. It was what he was for.\n\nAcross the street, someone said his name in a small voice. He turned and Tansy stood there, baby on hip, sweat on her lip, eyes big as saucers she\u2019d forgotten to wash. \u201cYou get him,\u201d she said. \u201cYou get him neat.\u201d\n\nHe glanced toward the square where he knew Dobbins would be practicing a speech about public nuisance and private responsibility. He nodded to Tansy. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you back his stink in a jar and we\u2019ll take turns smelling it whenever we forget what not to be.\u201d\n\nShe snorted. \u201cI don\u2019t forget.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said, and walked.\n\nThe live oaks arched and clutched, like hands in prayer or hands in habit. The road went to sand and the sand to roots and the roots to damp. He moved in the green like he\u2019d been born to it, which he had. The heat leaned and the mosquitoes tried him and he flicked them off because he was ornery that way. He followed the smell because you can follow a smell even if you hate it, and he made a small promise to the part of him that was a boy with a honey sandwich and a stick that he\u2019d come back through here sorry and whole.\n\nBehind him, his house put its shoulders up and stared at the empty space where Vespur had stood and decided to be a better house. Ahead of him, somewhere, Vespur decided to be a bigger problem. And in between them, in the trees and in the old bones of the town, the trick writhed and found new places to stick, the way a burr will find the cuff of your jeans and then your sock and then your skin. Merritt stepped careful and then not careful and then careful again, breath steady, hands ready, words in his mouth like stones he could throw if need be. He did not pray. He whistled a little, under his breath, a tune that had no words and no room for fear. And if his voice shook once, the palmettos pretended not to hear.Chapter three started the way a fever breaks: slow, with a clarity that did not feel like kindness. The bottle dump lay off a sand spur that had once been a road and was now mostly a suggestion with kudzu over it, a place where green glass had been poured out like the sea had lost patience and decided to be shards. They said the dump had been started when Prohibition made a kind of archaeology out of empty, and then every era since had added its own strata: medicine blue, cola brown, a generation of pickle jars, jelly gems, beer bones. In the heat, the glass held the sun in little cages so it could let it go again at angles that made birds misjudge. The oaks leaned back from it, not out of fear but out of the respect you give a place that keeps its own counsel. Merritt stood at the edge and put his hand down on a bottle half-buried and felt the fizz memory of a man\u2019s laugh in 1948 and a woman\u2019s hand in 1973 and a boy\u2019s boot in 1991, the footprints of thirst.\n\nHe tasted Vespur in the shimmer. It was not subtle. Vespur had come here recently and often. His stink was lacquered in the air and rubbed into the sharp. He had set up a little congregation in the dump\u2019s bowl, where the glass was thickest and the ground had given a little, and he had arranged bottles not the way a raccoon would or a kid, but the way a man arranges an altar he doesn\u2019t believe in but hopes will work. Merritt looked down at the neatness of the circle, the arc of green and brown, the blue in a triangle like teeth. It would be pretty if it didn\u2019t hum wrong. The hum was low and made the sac behind the ear itch. He whistled a thread of no tune and the hum complicated itself, admitted it was a weave, not a note.\n\nHe dropped to a crouch and nudged a bottle with a stick he\u2019d picked up that had sap dried on it like honey snow. The bottle sang. It sang a single syllable and then withdrew it as if embarrassed. He nudged another, and that one sounded like the breath through a reed with a hole half-covered. Vespur had made a call, then. Not to people. To under. To the part of the county that isn\u2019t mapped but is, a little, in the cooling charts in old houses\u2019 closets, where the damp licks its lips and counts itself. Merritt did not like that idea. He pressed his hand flat against the ground and listened to the earth say, Someone is reminding me I have other mouths. The voice was reasonable; the earth hates a lie, but it can be made to be impolite to itself when a man insistent brings a gift it cannot classify fast enough to refuse.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch the blue,\u201d said a voice behind him, and he didn\u2019t startle because he had already heard the whisper of Aunt Lydie\u2019s skirts through palmetto and the way the sand did only two crunches, not three. \u201cBlue is for the doctor, and Vespur don\u2019t know which doctor he\u2019s speaking to. He\u2019ll call the wrong one and then write his own death certificate and sign your name to it.\u201d\n\nHe stood and turned and she was there, hair tied up in a scarf that had started life as a red handkerchief and had been washed so many times it had become a new color unnamed. Her eyes were bright as if she had cried and then denied it to the mirror until the mirror gave up. She had her bag too, which was bigger and made of canvas blown with years and children, and it clinked in a way that meant she had brought the kitchen. He loved her all of a sudden, without sentiment, just the kind of love you have for a person who can talk a storm down to a boundary and make it stay there until the children are in and the dog tied.\n\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d be at home making coffee,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t mean to make it sound like a plea but it came out that way because a part of him was nine and had scraped his knee and wanted to sit on her porch and tell the scrape about itself.\n\n\u201cI made coffee, and it tasted like a funeral,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want that? I don\u2019t. I poured it on the ants. They got opinions now. Don\u2019t step on them, please. You seen Vespur\u2019s choir?\u201d\n\nHe gestured with his chin. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to make something come up and sing. He put hums in a bowl and is asking the air to be the choir master. He took Dad\u2019s name.\u201d The last wasn\u2019t a sentence he enjoyed saying. It tasted desperate and he mistrusted desperation. It made you use your teeth when your hands would do.\n\nAunt Lydie\u2019s mouth hardened like she was clapping without making a sound. \u201cWe\u2019ll cut his fingers off one by one and give them back to him as proper nouns,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wants to wear the man like a coat, let him find out buttons cost. You got your quarter?\u201d\n\n\u201cI got it,\u201d he said, and showed it, the silver with the hole and the red string. It felt like it had a weight disproportionate to its size, like it had learned gravity in a different school and came home with stories. He was suddenly, stupidly glad he had not used it at the fountain for a bigger flash. He might need it now for the true work.\n\n\u201cYou suck it if I tell you,\u201d she said, and he nodded because he was past the age where you argue with the woman who taught you to take operations as they come. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t touch the blue. You touched the blue?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t touch the blue.\u201d He stepped down into the bowl with her, careful where his boots went and more careful where his attention went. Vespur would have left a flattery trap or two, a little sheen here, a bottle neck that made a nice mirror there, and you lean in and someone grabs you from under your own face. Merritt was susceptible to flattery in the way men who try not to be are. He liked to be useful. That\u2019s a soft spot same as any.\n\nThey circled. They moved bottles but not with their hands, with the handles of their tools, with old care. Aunt Lydie muttered promises to the dirt. The dirt, which is a pragmatic creature, agreed not to take their feet if they took three pieces and left four. Merritt whistled and the whistle was not a call this time but a question about scale, and the hum adjusted its weight toward his ear as if to oblige. The hum liked to be liked.\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s calling doesn\u2019t have a name people use,\u201d Aunt Lydie said. She spoke as if she were telling him how to get to the good gas station. Her tone took the barbs out of the topic. \u201cIt lives where wet holds smell like a preacher holds a boy\u2019s shoulder, tight but saying it\u2019s for love. It eats what goes wrong on its way to right. It isn\u2019t mean; it\u2019s tired. Tired turns mean if you shake it long enough. He\u2019s rattling its cage.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s good at that,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cHe\u2019s a stick on a fence. He\u2019s the boy who bangs the pot with the spoon and then looks like he invented percussion. Why here?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause here holds memory like a jar,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a glass mouth. He\u2019s playing it like a horn. He don\u2019t blow right, but he blows long. People think about trash and they think about empty. Trash isn\u2019t empty. It\u2019s full of try. Full of the last of an intent. Drink. Save. Sweet. Keep. He\u2019s using the kept and the sweet that went bad and he\u2019s telling the under to take heart because we up here got lazy.\u201d\n\nMerritt nodded because it did feel like a sermon being preached to an audience that had not consented. He had been in those churches. He set his bag down and took out the blue rope and cut a length with the knife and tied a knot so plain it was nothing but an honest knot. He wet it, breathed into it, and set it over the north of the circle. He placed the mirror bit south and angled it so it caught the sky and then refused it. He set the horseshoe nail east where it would remember the road and the quarter west where it would remember debt. He thought about his father, not the name but the man, and he put that thought into the way he touched the ground. He could feel the ground recognize it. The ground likes a man who can carry a bucket without slopping water on his own shoes.\n\n\u201cTell me something true,\u201d Aunt Lydie said suddenly. She was standing with one foot on a 7-Up bottle and one on a pickle jar, and her weight was perfect over both. \u201cSay it like you mean it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis ghost isn\u2019t in that thing that sat on my bed,\u201d Merritt said. He looked at her and the words had their own ease after he started. \u201cMy father isn\u2019t a smear of apology made into a man shape. He isn\u2019t a voice in a phone box. He isn\u2019t a coin of pig fat. He\u2019s the way to tie a truck bed so nothing falls out. He\u2019s the itch you get when you forgot a tool on the grass. He\u2019s the taste of a peach and the lesson that if you don\u2019t wipe your knife you don\u2019t get to use it twice. He\u2019s not that thing Vespur put there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d she said, and her eyes got wet like she had bitten into something sharp. \u201cSuck your quarter.\u201d\n\nHe put it to his mouth like a child a charm and sucked and tasted tin first because his mouth had learned wrong from cheap coins, and then he tasted not tin but a clean cold, a January in a well. The quarter had been made before they took the silver out and replaced it with something that lied. He closed his eyes. He saw a woman at a sink in a year when the radio hissed in the curtains. He saw a parade of soldiers he did not know. He saw a hand press a coin into a palm and say, Pay what you owe. He felt the quarter settle under his tongue like he had swallowed a small moon.\n\nThe hum did not like this. It wobbled. It tried to be a good hum and be friendly, then it remembered it had been arranged by a bad man and decided to get uppity. The bottles rattled a little and the blue ones actually hummed higher, thin and at the top of hearing. Aunt Lydie hissed through her teeth, a sharp sound that bit the air and made it step back. \u201cDon\u2019t you try to whistle me,\u201d she said to the hum, and it realized its mistake. She bent and rearranged two browns with the tip of a spoon she had pulled from her bag, and those browns dropped the center of the thing from grievous to grumpy.\n\nVespur did not appear. Vespur knew to let his work sit in other hands and soak them like onions. He had left a thing, and the thing did his leaning. Merritt felt for the thread of Dad\u2019s name and did not feel it there, which meant Vespur had carried the piece on him. That would complicate the work like a burr complicates a sock. He would get around it. He\u2019d been taught arounds.\n\n\u201cWhat we do is unstring his strings and not break the instrument,\u201d he said, mostly to convince the air. \u201cI could pitch a fit. I could smash and salt. The springs would like it for a minute and then hate me for a year. The under is on its belly and he\u2019s poking it with a fork. We can get the fork out. We can dull the tines.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can teach it to eat in the woods again instead of at our table,\u201d Aunt Lydie said, and her mouth went sideways because she liked her own metaphor. She took out a small cloth packet from her bag and handed it to him. Inside was a gray powder with spark in it. \u201cDust of clove and iron and the hard part of a bee, the stinger and the will right behind it. Put that on the green.\u201d\n\nHe did, careful, like he was salting a fish. The powder took the slick that lay like pride on the glass and gritted it down into something a worm could consider without dying of ambition. He felt the under shift, a long exhale, not ease but acquiescence. The spring woman moved in his mind like a fish turning, old bones smooth with water. She said, Thank you, and then, Be quick. He was heartened and not, because when a spirit that takes a century to have an opinion tells you to hurry, you hurry.\n\nHe took the blue rope, now dark with wet from his breath and the air, and snapped it again and laid it across the circle like a sentence ended the right way. He placed the nail at its head, the quarter at its tail, and the mirror in between so that any under that slid up would see its own wet face and be shy. The hum got confused. Confusion is a door. He opened it. He sang something his mother had hummed when she shelled peas and he had thought it was just a tune and now saw it was a path. Sister, sister, go slow, we will not spill, we will move the bowl as one. The bottles shivered and then went still. The blue did not chime. The green did not slick. The brown sat like good dug earth. It wasn\u2019t a finish. It was a pause that could be taught to be a stop.\n\nThey stood up together. They breathed. The glass in the heat clicked as if it were cooling even though the day climbed. Aunt Lydie wiped her face with her scarf and looked younger and older for it. \u201cThat\u2019s two stitches and a knot,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019ll cut one by supper, two by night. He has time. He ain\u2019t got sense about when to stop. He thinks if he runs enough no one will notice he\u2019s in one place always.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d Merritt asked. He scooped up his rope and his mirror and his other small truths. He hated leaving circles behind, even circles interrupted, but the day said move.\n\n\u201cBy the tracks where the kudzu ate a truck and you can still see the mirror if you go in deep,\u201d she said. \u201cHe made a cypress house in a place that doesn\u2019t like cypress. He\u2019s in love with the wrong trees like he\u2019s in love with the wrong saints. They tell him no and he hears yes. You ready to be mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready to be precise,\u201d he said. He tasted the quarter again in his mouth and it tasted like decision. \u201cMean gets on your hands. Precision cleans itself if you let it.\u201d\n\nThey cut through palmetto. Palmetto is not kind to legs but it is honest about its knives. The ground went wet underfoot where the land decided to remember, briefly, that it had been river once. Mosquitoes fussed and he flicked them with a little magic and some with his fingers because solutions should not all be elegant. They came on the tracks. They were not tracks anymore; they were a line with history. The kudzu had covered what it could and then shrugged over the rest like a blanket a cat had pulled and that would do. They went in, under, in a green shade that had weight and temperature. Merritt slowed because this was the kind of place that liked to count you before and after and complain if the numbers did not match.\n\nThe truck was there. It might had been a Ford in the 80s. It had lived, worked, blown a hose, and been left like a promise broken on a weekday. The kudzu had made it a shrine, hung with leaves, full of frogs. The mirror was indeed intact, and it held the green whole and made it meaner. Vespur had scratched sigils on it with a key or a penny in a way that made the mirror think about not reflecting the way it always had. Merritt looked without leaning and saw a shape in the seat that wanted to be a man and was a bundle of burlap with a shirt over it. He did not say hello to it. He didn\u2019t honor decoys.\n\n\u201cUp,\u201d Aunt Lydie said, chin. He followed her look. The cypress began where they should not, their ankles in not enough water, absurd and stubborn. Someone had lashed boards between three of them and call it a house. Mud had been smeared for insulation in a way that said, I\u2019m clever, and the mud had said, I am not your friend but I will ride with you until I have time to be. Tied under the house was a cage made of bicycle rims and coat hangers and in it something had curled that looked like a dog and a sack of rags and a wounded idea. It was asleep or pretending and it stank with a sweetness that made the teeth ache.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say its name,\u201d Aunt Lydie said. \u201cIt\u2019s not its name and it will wear it wrong. If it wakes, give it something to eat that isn\u2019t you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got oranges,\u201d he said. He did, in his bag, because he was not raised for hunger. He got one out and balanced it in his palm so it won\u2019t be an insult if he threw it. He looked up. The house let him know it knew he was there. He knew how to talk to houses but this one had been taught a mouth by Vespur and it was a mouth with extra teeth. He let Aunt Lydie speak. She can talk a building into telling you what it married and why.\n\n\u201cWho sits in you?\u201d she asked it, as if she had knocked and the house had answered and she could see the person through the screen and needed to make a decision. \u201cIs it him? Or did he go and leave his hat?\u201d\n\nThe house thought about lying and chose not to because lying takes more energy than people imagine and the boards had some sense left. It told them: he\u2019s inside and he\u2019s awake and he\u2019s proud because he arranged a wall with jars in it and the jars sing when the wind goes. He\u2019s in love with his own truth. He thinks his stink is a spice. He thinks we appreciate him for being consistent.\n\n\u201cDoes he have the thread?\u201d Merritt asked. He didn\u2019t say whose thread or what thread, because names were sensitive and the house would give all of it up if it knew what all of it was. He kept his ask small and the house could keep its answer safe. That\u2019s how we get along.\n\nIt said yes in creaks and a small falling of dust. Merritt nodded like he\u2019d expected that, which he had. He wrapped the orange peel around his finger and let oil pop into the air. The stink wavered a fraction, as if remembering the concept of pleasant. He took the horseshoe nail and put it in his mouth for a second and tasted rust and sorrel and the horse. He took it out and flicked it underhand and it lodged in the lash roping between boards as if it had been magnet and wood had been true north. He felt the rope remember being held by a hand that did not care if its palm blistered.\n\n\u201cYou want me to go,\u201d Aunt Lydie said in that way she had that meant she already wasn\u2019t. \u201cYou want to make it a straight line, you and him and the coins in the between. You want me to be the net if you fall.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you not to get bit,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t say he wanted his aunt to not see him if he had to do unclean, because she already had and still brought him grits. He wanted to keep the ledger tidy in her eyes even if the math went sideways elsewhere. \u201cYou be the bell. If you hear me say a word wrong, you ring so loud even the deer fall down and you wake the sky.\u201d\n\nShe fished a hand-sized bell out of her bag, iron and old, with a crack like a lost tooth. She kissed it and set it to her lips like a horn and didn\u2019t blow. \u201cYou go then,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd mind your elbows. He\u2019ll go for joints. He likes to make a man bend wrong so he can laugh.\u201d\n\nMerritt climbed. He put his boots where wood would bear and not scold, hands where nails weren\u2019t making a point. He could feel Vespur\u2019s attention the way you feel a stare through a window that\u2019s got a screen you can\u2019t see from the outside. He stopped at the sill and made the sign that meant I\u2019m polite and the sign that meant I will be rude if you make me. He was in, then.\n\nThe jars were what the house had said: a wall of them, big picklers and little jam-keepers, nailed and wired, cobalt and clear, a stained glass made by a drunk angel who had learned only half of color. In each, something wet. In some, just water that had been made to be not water by being put in. In others, rags. In one, hair. In one, candles stubbed and then drowned. A jar hummed when the wind went, and the wind did not go but the jar hummed, which meant Vespur had put something in them that did not require air to sing. The sound stroked the room.\n\n\u201cYou like my organ?\u201d Vespur asked, and he turned, smiling, from where he had been trimming a wick that didn\u2019t deserve it. He was cleaner than he had been at Merritt\u2019s house, because he had washed with something that had lemons in it and then refused to rinse. The cleanliness on him looked like mockery. He had tucked Merritt\u2019s father\u2019s thread in his breast pocket like a handkerchief, barely, intentionally visible. It made Merritt see red and also want to laugh at the pettiness because pettiness, done that neat, deserved either a crown or a kick. He chose the kick.\n\n\u201cYour organ is out of tune,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cAnd your hands are wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always think I\u2019m playing the wrong song,\u201d Vespur said, pleased that they could slip into the corridor of an old fight and pace it. \u201cYou\u2019d like it if I did scales. I don\u2019t practice. I perform.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerform for who?\u201d Merritt asked. He stepped in. He kept his shoulders relaxed and his knees awake. He noticed the floor had been powdered with a little ash and a little flour, so Vespur could read feet. He didn\u2019t let the floor read him; he read it. He put his weight in the way that says I could have been a dancer if I\u2019d wanted but I liked fixing tractors better.\n\n\u201cFor the lady under,\u201d Vespur said, with reverence that wasn\u2019t respect. \u201cShe wanted to sleep. I opened the shutters. You should be thanking me. People like you like to fuss when you got no work to do. The county was quiet. I gave you a reason. You look beautiful when you\u2019re trying.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look like you got fish in your pockets,\u201d Merritt said, and Vespur laughed. He had a beautiful laugh, everything wrong about him condensed into joy. It made Merritt nearly, almost sorry.\n\n\u201cYou came to take your daddy back,\u201d Vespur said, and tapped his pocket. He had the thread on a little safety pin like the kind that holds together last-minute bridesmaids. \u201cYou came to make a man act right. You came to say this house is a sin and make it come back as a porch. You ain\u2019t the only one knows how to talk to doors.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came to kick your organ,\u201d Merritt said, and then he did, not the way you kick a dog or a man but the way you kick a door you know is not load-bearing. He put his heel into a jar that hummed exact and needed not to. It broke with a sound like a conch being insulted and the hum upset. The other jars took it as a cue to panic, and panic made them louder because hummed panic is never quieter. He threw the orange. It hit a jar of hair and the hair soaked up the citrus and went limp with gratitude. He flicked his mirror piece and it cut a string that had been hidden in shadow and that string had been attached to a little bell and the bell rang once and the house woke all the way.\n\nVespur\u2019s face changed. It dropped its mask of conversation and showed temper, the simple kind, not a strategy. He loves being interrupted. He hates it, too. He came fast with his hand out flat and the stink on it made the air try to step back. Merritt put his forearm up and took the slap the way you take the wave from a boat you saw coming. It stung. It had coins in it. He let the pain be a marker, not a wall. He drove forward, not for Vespur, not yet, but for the jars.\n\nVespur grabbed for his pocket but Merritt had run a line in the floor quick with the blue rope and the rope tripped him the way a memory does when you laugh and then remember something sad. He went down sideways and barked his elbow and howled like a coyote and then grinned while he was howling, because he contained multitudes. He fumbled with the pin and pulled the thread and held it up by two fingers and in that second Merritt smelled his father\u2019s Saturday. He wanted to cry. He didn\u2019t. He went for the thread like a man going for a snake that has a ribbon in its mouth.\n\nThe bell below blew. Aunt Lydie had heard a word wrong because he had said a word wrong, because Vespur\u2019s hand had gone for his knee with two fingers and made the joint think it belonged to a different life. He staggered, said, \u201cNo,\u201d but not to what he meant. The iron cry went through him like a friend leaves a party, with hugging, and he woke his sense. He spat the taste of quarter into his mouth on purpose and the world steadied.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you be clever,\u201d he told Vespur, because clever still matters to men who think they are. \u201cGive me my father\u2019s coat.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks good on me,\u201d Vespur said, and it did not. He licked the thread and his tongue went numb and he shuddered and he smiled. The smile was a room without furniture. \u201cYou like to keep your dead tidy. I like them lively.\u201d\n\nMerritt went low instead of high. He took Vespur at the ankles not with his hands but with the weight of his name, the part of his name that was a wheel-barrel full of feed and an inclination to put shoulders into things. He yanked. Vespur\u2019s balance went. The thread went up, then down. Merritt snatched. He had it. For a second he had it and it burned like ice and sang like a kettle. He tucked it into his shirt where it could lay on his skin and know it was home, even if not all the way.\n\nVespur screamed not a word, not a noise, but he screamed, and all the jars broke together like a choir finding an agreement you don\u2019t want to hear. The dog-sack thing under the house woke and struggled, and the green outside leaned in, and the under heaved in its wet bed. Merritt grabbed Vespur by the coat not to hit him but to make him look at him. He said, \u201cStop,\u201d and he said it with the weight of the porch and the fence post and the hoof of the mare that had knocked the morning to sense. He put authority on it. He put ancestry. He put his mother washing her hands and drying them before she touched his hair. He put it all.\n\nVespur froze because authority still works if you say it right. He blinked. His eyes were pond and a boy under the pond. He smiled, small, like he remembered something from when he had been less wrong. He said, almost wonder, \u201cYou love that man.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d Merritt said. He did not let go. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to stop. You\u2019re going to go into the pig fat you love and wash in it and come out the other side a little cleaner.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr else?\u201d Vespur asked. He liked fights that could be theatrical. Merritt disappointed him by not making it grand.\n\n\u201cOr else I make you owe me,\u201d he said, and Vespur flinched because debt was something he did not believe in until someone else held the note. Merritt took the silver quarter out of his mouth and pressed it flat against Vespur\u2019s forehead and the coin stuck like a wet leaf and sizzled like bacon and Vespur tried to laugh and it came out a cough with prayer in it. \u201cPay me back,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cNot money. Days. You pay me days of quiet. You pay me springs clear. You pay me a town that can sleep. Or else that debt pulls your joints apart on a Sabbath and lets you think about your choices.\u201d\n\nVespur moved his mouth. He wanted to spit. He wanted to say a charm that would fly like a mosquito and get in Merritt\u2019s ear. He wanted to wriggle. He was a wanting man. He nodded. He couldn\u2019t help it. The quarter made the nod like gravity made falling. He whispered a yes and tried to make it sound like a no. The house bucked. The jars were gone. The rope snapped back and bit Merritt\u2019s calf and reminded him he was, in fact, constructible.\n\nAunt Lydie\u2019s bell blew again, not an alarm this time but a cadence, an end. The dog-sack under went back to its nap with a bad breath snore. The cypress shuddered like women who\u2019d laughed too much at a wake. The hum fell out of the air like dust out of a shaken rug. Merritt did not trust the peace. It was too neat. It was Vespur\u2019s kind of peace, curated and timed. He took the thread from his shirt and could taste, in his own teeth, that it was not all of it. It was enough to bring the house to itself. It was not enough to bring his father\u2019s coat back to warmth. Vespur saw the knowledge in his face and smiled like a boy who had eaten only half the pie on the window and thought that meant he had been generous.\n\n\u201cYou like to think you finish,\u201d Vespur said. \u201cLook at you, in the middle. Look how you glow.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out of this house,\u201d Merritt said, because he had to complete the spell he had started, and the house wanted him to complete it. \u201cDon\u2019t put hands on it again. Don\u2019t put your breath in the jars. Don\u2019t lay your head here even by mistake. It will not rock you.\u201d\n\nVespur took his coat and his bag and a handful of insults and slid out past him with a courtesy that was almost saintly. He paused by the door and looked back. There was a hope in his face, small, like a lantern kept in a closet. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you have fun,\u201d he said, and then he was down and into green and gone. He left behind less smell than Merritt expected. He had learned to fold some of it away. He had left other things, though, small wrongs that would be found by fingers in the night and needed mending. He was going to be more work than men ought to be to each other.\n\nMerritt waited. He did not fall or sit or gloat. He stood and let his shoulders come down and he listened to the under, and the under said, I can breathe for a minute, and the spring woman said, I will be at the place you found me tonight and I will ask you a thing, and Aunt Lydie\u2019s bell went quiet because she had put it down and was watching dragonflies fix the light. He tucked the thread deep, not in the box in his house where a rat might write poetry with it, but in the place between his ribs where the sternum protects singers. He would get the rest. He would need a better knife or a softer hand. He would talk to the woman under the water. He would talk to his father not by name but by work, which is the way that man liked to talk anyway.\n\n\u201cWe got to go,\u201d he called down to his aunt, and she called back, \u201cWe do,\u201d and her voice had coffee in it now, which meant she had forgiven the day a little for being itself. They moved back through green, not triumphant, not defeated, in that after of a fight where your cheek starts to swell and you don\u2019t tell the other person what you intend to put on it for the bruise.\n\nWhen they reached the edge of the dump again the light had changed in the way that makes shadows show their bones. The bottles didn\u2019t hum. Some of them had hairline fractures that made them dangerous to touch and prettier. Merritt thought about gathering them up and then thought about the way glass wants to go home to sand and left them. He picked one, cobalt, the size of a child\u2019s fist, uncracked. He put it in his bag. A trophy, not for him, for the house, so it could have something blue that wasn\u2019t a note.\n\nOn the way to the truck they met a man with a cooler, coming the other way, face red and eyes narrow, and he nodded to them like you nod to neighbors at the boundary of where you think the law begins. He said, \u201cHeard it stinks up yonder,\u201d and Merritt said, \u201cNot anymore,\u201d and the man said, \u201cGood,\u201d and they all pretended that meant the same thing. Merritt put his hand on the hood of his truck and it purred at him accusatory because he had turned it off earlier when Tansy told him not to, and he told it a joke and it forgave him and started.\n\nBack at his road the smoke had forgotten its own ambition and turned into a story people would tell that evening over sinks while they washed plates. His porch had a tooth or two still rolling, patient as dice. He swept them into a jar and put the jar under the sink because he didn\u2019t yet know whether to bury them or cook them or melt them. He walked through his house and it exhaled him back like bread ready to be taken from the oven. He touched the box and said, \u201cNot yet,\u201d and it sat still and watched him with the patience of cedar.\n\nHe went to the sink and washed his hands again, not because they were dirty but because he needed a minute where his hands did something plain before they did something hard again. The phone skittered where it lay and he picked it up. Lyle had left a message in the voice of a man who wants to be calm the way a dog wants to be a cat. \u201cFountain\u2019s quiet,\u201d Lyle said. \u201cMayor says he did that. I told him he ought get a ribbon if that\u2019s true. Also, Mason\u2019s dogs are still weird. Also, Juniper is mad at you for reasons. Also, you coming to the square tonight? Band\u2019s playing. Might be quiet enough that you can hear them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to the springs,\u201d Merritt said to the sink and the sink said, Yes. He dried his hands. He took the marlin opener out of his pocket and set it in a place of honor\u2014a nail on the wall where it could see the door\u2014and it caught the light and looked like work.\n\nHe poured coffee, and it did not taste like a funeral because Aunt Lydie had put something by the pot earlier, a leaf that told the brew to be brave, and he had not noticed. He drank and thought of his father and did not hurt as much for a second, and then hurt more. He put his hat on and the day opened for him like a book with a cracked spine that still had a story he loved inside.\n\nOn the way out he paused on the porch and looked at the bottle tree. It had a new sound in it, a low note, and he realized Rosa must have tucked something there while he was in the green. He looked and saw a square of cloth tied to the end of a branch, printed with lemons. He laughed, a small sound, and the tree laughed back. He stepped down careful and the pig fat was gone, dispersed or ashamed, and when he stepped into the yard the grass stood up like a dog deciding to live again.\n\nThe springs would be cold. They would be honest. The woman under would have requests. Vespur would be somewhere, making himself a religion out of stain. Merritt would need better words, older words, to put the under back in its bed and tuck it so it did not suffocate. He walked and the live oaks did their arch, and he whistled the song with no words and no room for fear, and this time his voice did not shake.Chapter five began with the kind of light that looks like it has to be held up by two hands. The day had gone down the long steps into evening and left the last of itself at the springs, pooling pale on the limestone the way milk skins over when you forget it on the stove. The park was closed with that particular finality that comes when a place that has entertained all day insists on remembering its own bones. The glass-bottom boats, fat as old ladies in church hats, moored and lulled themselves against their tethers, each window looking down like an eye too tired to keep watching. Merritt slid past the chain that meant keep out and the sign that meant liability and walked the boardwalk with the soft arrogance of someone who had paid more than admission in his lifetime.\n\nThe water was blue with night and blue with itself. It had none of the green slime that had ridden it like a dare that afternoon. The slick had been shorn from its back by rope and bell and powder, and the spring lay like a throat that had been cleared. The boil in the middle made its slow, dense roil, a heartbeat of aquifer. Merritt leaned on the rail and set his bag just so and breathed the cold that comes up even in Florida when earth remembers that not everything is sweaty. In the trees, cicadas had picked up the song they\u2019d dropped earlier, but they were cautious, each phrase like a hand put into a dark drawer before the light switch is found.\n\nHe put a peeled wedge of orange on the rail to sweeten his own temper and to see if the night wanted to borrow any of it, and then he took the quarter on its red string and held it over the water where it could smell its own ore in the limestone. The woman rose without fuss. She never came up in drama; she wasn\u2019t a god. She was a function that had personality, which is to say she was the part of the land that had learned to like you if you liked it back. She looked like somebody\u2019s aunt who did not have children but had sprouted patience anyway, hair gone gray in a heavy sheet that did not actually move, face full as river stones, eyes like the blue only springs hold. She carried no light and made a kind all the same, the kind you can read your hands by and not be judged for what they have done.\n\n\u201cYou made me say be quick,\u201d Merritt said, low and without preamble. The boardwalk under his arms listened. \u201cI\u2019m here. Say your ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou put powder on a hurt,\u201d she said, voice through the water, not at a distance from it. It came up like a current and went down like truth. \u201cYou did not name the one who cut the hurt, not to me. I like you better for that. Names make things decide to be worse, sometimes. I have a request. It is not small, but it is not unpayable. Will you take it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will listen,\u201d he answered, because he had been raised by people who knew that agreeing to a thing you hadn\u2019t heard yet was a way to wake in a field without your shirt. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong that isn\u2019t the immediate wrong?\u201d\n\nShe turned, not her head but the water, and in the turning he saw down the throat of the spring, down the channeled, limed chute into the darker river where light was only accounting. He saw, for the blink it takes to know what you\u2019re looking at, a row of posts that had not been posts when they were made, a line carved in limestone with iron, and the iron had rusted and stayed. He saw something that moved like a slick and something that did not move because bones are stubborn. He thought of chains and then dismissed it because this was not about people, not yet, and then had to un-dismiss it because everything here was about people finally.\n\n\u201cYou keep me for leisure,\u201d she said, not angry, archived. \u201cAnd worse, for seeing through. Eyes. Windows. People have put glass over me for a hundred years and called it kindness. Before that, men in lines cut the bottom so other men could sit with their feet in cold and say they were refreshed. Before that, a woman came with a child and put the child in and asked me to take fever, and I did, and the child grew, and the woman brought me a jar of pear preserves and sat where the board is now and told me about her mother. The iron stays. The smell stays. The story stays. The child grew and died still; not immediately, but eventually. I am not a god,\u201d she said again, as if reminding herself. \u201cThe under is breathing through my mouth wrong. The wrongness is old and has stripes like a raccoon tail and some of the stripes are men\u2019s and some are mine. I want you to pull up a thing that isn\u2019t yours and carry it to a place where it will be more at home. I will ask for one other thing after, and you will decide, and I will not be mean if you say no.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in the under,\u201d he said, tasting limestone in the back of his tongue even before he stepped off. \u201cNot that way. I went in through dreams when I was a boy and came out in Aunt Lydie\u2019s tub with the dog barking at me like I had been reborn wrong. You want me to hold my breath and trust rope?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to hold your breath and trust my mouth,\u201d she said, which should have been frightening but felt like a promise. \u201cHe shook me like a carpet. You stopped that. He pushed anger in with stink. You made the stink be work. This next is bigger because it\u2019s smaller. It\u2019s not one man\u2019s mean. It\u2019s a stuck thing. Will you unstick?\u201d\n\nHe untied his boots and set them side by side like men standing for a photograph. He wound his name tight behind his teeth so it wouldn\u2019t leak and invited only the parts of it that had use underwater\u2014Patience, Weight that knows where to go, Hands that can find a knot by feel\u2014to come along. He took out the blue rope and tied it around his middle and tied the other end to the rail in a knot that could be undone from beneath with a thought and that could not be undone from above by anything but teeth. He put the coin in his mouth and let it sit like a polite threat on his tongue. He took the orange wedge and bit it and let the sweetness push over fear. He looked like a man about to swim and he was, but the swimming he was about to do had nothing to do with lungs.\n\n\u201cLyle will come looking if I don\u2019t wave him off,\u201d he said, because saying practical things keeps you in your own pockets. \u201cIf he shows, tell him to count to two hundred by tens and if I\u2019m not back by then he can throw a fit. He likes doing that. It\u2019ll suit him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will rattle his badge,\u201d the woman said, and her mouth did a movement that wasn\u2019t laughter and was. \u201cGo down and put your hands on the old iron. Pull it up slow. There are names knotted on it like wet socks. Don\u2019t read them. Bring the iron up and set it on the deck and let the air argue with it. I will handle the rest.\u201d\n\nHe eased himself into the water and the shock of it hit him clean as a slap from a cheap aunt and better meant. He let that first cold be a wake and the second be a lesson and then there was no third because he was down and the spring\u2019s hand was on his chest and his legs did not kick because the boil did it for them. The water refused him panic by giving him too much information all at once; tiny air bubbles grazed him like he\u2019d laid down in a field of mice and they\u2019d all been polite; fish flashed close and then away with the offended speed of deer; his fingers found the rock edges that were as smooth as old opinions and then the crack where the cut had been made and then the iron, not a bar but a grate, slatted, spiked, forced in the age when muscle did this work with ... with what? He didn\u2019t finish that thought because breath is counting and distraction is debt.\n\nHe put his hand under the iron and felt the silt accumulated, not heavy because water disciplines weight, but stubborn. He put his other hand on the edge, where a little lip had been left by somebody who even back then had thought, We may need to get this out one day, and he blessed that someone and did not name him. The names slithered around his fingers like eels that wanted to be cats and he did not let them be. He went still and asked the iron to remember being ore. Ore loves to move. Man taught it to be still and useful. It remembered wanting, and he put his back into it and lifted.\n\nThe grate resisted with old politeness. He felt the rope around his waist go taut as the spring and he did not pull at it. He made the iron decide. He thought of fence posts and of beds unsprung and of the way his father used to say, Don\u2019t pry, boy, encourage. The iron encouraged. It came nudging up and then one corner freed and something below blew a long sigh like a mule turned back onto the field after church. He felt the current adjust, not angry, new. He had room to get a grip that would not scrape his knuckles bloody against rock and he used it and the iron granted him that it would leave.\n\nWhen it broke the surface it did it without fanfare, which is how big things should do it. He hauled the grate onto the deck. It clanged with a sound like all the old friends of iron showing up at once and saying, Well look what the river dragged in. Water sheeted off and ran between the slats and made first the boardwalk then the dirt underneath remember the shape of the bars. The names on it lay quiet, not wanting air. The smell that came up was not rot powder; it was something not relieved to be seen and also not willing to hide. It was the smell of a wound you kept clean without it ever closing because closing would mean it hadn\u2019t been necessary. Merritt sat down hard because the world tilted the way world does when it has to make room for a thing that had been there all along.\n\nThe woman\u2019s head broke again and the batch of her hair made a soft slap on the water. She looked at the grate without blinking because blinking is for eyeballs and hers were opinion. \u201cIt is not all of it,\u201d she said, and by that he understood that under there the line of iron continued, farther than his arms, into the throat and beyond, rusted into the lip of the under and some part of it had never been intended to come out. \u201cIt is enough for the river to stop apologizing for a choice it did not make. Thank you. I would take the names from you now, and dissolve them in a place that does not echo.\u201d\n\nMerritt did not touch the knots. He sat with water cooling on his shirt and the quarter in his mouth fighting with the taste of spring and orange and something that had not deserved its keeping. He reached down with two fingers and slid the knots into a jar he had brought for bait once upon a time and never used for bait because he had never liked tricking fish into thinking their day was going to be interesting. The jar took the names like they were dumplings. He put the lid on and tightened it and the jar made a sound like it was glad to work. He handed it over the rail to her and she took it with both hands like it was hot. She sank with it like a mother with a baby into a cold bath. He could have sworn he heard a ding, small and regular, further in, as if someone had hung a bell in the throat and left it and the tide rung it when nothing else remembered to.\n\n\u201cYou said you\u2019d ask for another thing,\u201d he said when the water calmed and the night leaned down to eavesdrop again. He had no towel and he didn\u2019t want one. He liked the clean chill. It made him honest. It made the story of who he was be easy to tell to himself.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d said the springs, and in that moment the woman\u2019s mouth was not just the lake\u2019s but all the mouths in the county where water had decided to look up. \u201cSomeone part of you is in a place that does not hold people well. You know this. You want him very much to be where he belongs. If I give you the route to the rest of that thread you put in your shirt, if I show you the hand that holds it and the teeth that hold that hand, you will owe me something that isn\u2019t work. Work you have done. Work you will do. I want something that is my favorite to want. I want a story that has not been told yet.\u201d\n\nHe laughed, a little, before he could stop himself. The cold made it tinny in his own ears. He thought of all the stories men had told in Ocala and laid heavy on the breathing door of the water and pretended were gifts. \u201cYou want what?\u201d he asked, though he had heard.\n\n\u201cA story,\u201d she said again, and was patient with him without being condescending. \u201cA new one. Not clever. Not the trick you tell at a bar to see if men think you are more than you are. A true story that has not happened. You give it to me before it happens. You promise it. You carry it until it does happen. And while you carry it, the under will be kinder to you. When it happens we will both have it to put on our shelves. If it does not happen, you may never drink here again without coughing. Do you accept this debt?\u201d\n\nHe sat back and considered bargaining. He considered offering days of quiet that he had already gotten from Vespur in a way that had to be repaid in a turn of the wheel. He considered offering the blue rope, the coin, his mother\u2019s hummed tune, the marlin opener, all of which were real and wouldn\u2019t satisfy. He thought of Aunt Lydie\u2019s bell and the way it broke his mouth when it went through him and knew that the price here was a different instrument. He leaned forward and put his hands on the rail as if it were a pulpit and he was full of sense and said, \u201cAll right. I will bring you a story that isn\u2019t made. I will make it by doing it. I don\u2019t know which one yet, but it\u2019ll be a story that improves the air.\u201d\n\nThe water smiled without water being able to. \u201cIt is a pleasure dealing with you. He is in the cold part under the bottle dump where men made pits and the rained-on days forgot to evaporate. He tied your father\u2019s piece to a story about money and left it in a jar with a worm and a promise to come back for it when the worm grew. He forgot worms don\u2019t grow that way. He will not remember until you have put your hand on it. There is a snapping turtle there who thinks he owns the jar. He will discuss rent with you in the old tongue. Do not flatter him.\u201d\n\nMerritt stood and re-tied his boots and the leather took his wet without comment like a friend who will show up to drive you without needing to know why. He felt his shirt cling and thought of childhood nights when he had come home from the sinkhole with a cussedness he applied to everything and his father had handed him a towel without a sermon. He tucked the penny taste away, the quarter hung against his teeth like a flag in no wind, and he chuckled at himself because he\u2019d started calling the silver a penny in his head and that meant his mind was tired. He nodded to the boat with its eyes and to the spring with her mouth and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be back with something you\u2019ll like. If you start to cough when I\u2019m done I\u2019ll know I failed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will not fail,\u201d she told him, not because she believed in him in a greeting-card way but because she had measured the shape of him and knew what weight he could carry without throwing his back. \u201cYou will get distracted. Everyone does. The smell is for that. The smell is an invitation to tell yourself the wrong story.\u201d\n\nOn the way back to the truck he saw Lyle coming with a flashlight, shoulders up like a man getting ready to suggest something tender to a skittish horse. He waved, big, exaggerated, and Lyle dropped his light beam low and took his hat off because there are places you do that even if nobody will see you but the raccoons. Lyle looked at Merritt\u2019s wet shirt and the rusty stripe on the boardwalk and the iron lying like a prehistoric fish and he exhaled like a man who had held his breath without meaning to.\n\n\u201cI was going to count,\u201d he said, halfway embarrassed. \u201cI lost track at six because somebody in the trees coughed and I was composing a ticket in my head for coughing in a public space.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can write it,\u201d Merritt said, smiling despite himself. \u201cI\u2019ll sign it. Flood the jail with coughers. We got a chart to work on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you bring up?\u201d Lyle asked, and then he answered himself because he had eyes. \u201cSomething that made us wrong before we had the new wrong. You\u2019re going to tell me a story about that in a minute, and I\u2019m going to misunderstand it and then correct myself in the retelling and get it right on the third try.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going back under by the dump,\u201d Merritt said, and watched Lyle wince because the dump was the kind of place a deputy keeps tabs on even in his sleep. \u201cIf I don\u2019t come back by\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t play that,\u201d Lyle said, sharp because he was tired of the practice men make of dramatic timing. \u201cCome back. I\u2019ll get coffee to the old place and tell Aunt Lydie you said to go ahead and have pie without you if she has pie. And, Merritt, if you need a ladder of hands, you call. We\u2019ll stand on each other. I got boys.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Merritt said, and did. He clapped Lyle on the arm without crushing his good intentions and walked into the night that had finally decided to be honest and dark.\n\nAt the dump the glass held stars with the same greed it had held sun. It took the sky privatized and made it shine in small squares so a man could pick one up like candy and be fooled. The insects had settled on a key that made your bones feel like strings. The road in was a hush that knew its own cars. Merritt parked three trees back and walked the rest, and because he had agreed to bring a story that had not yet happened he felt the edge of his choices change. He could feel the future like a fabric he might cut. He felt careful in a new way, not of falling, but of stepping on a pattern that could be prettier if he moved his foot two inches left.\n\nHe found the pit by the smell first, the old wet, not swamp and not ditch, but cellar that had been cut you-shouldn\u2019t, with water in it that remembered bottles and men\u2019s hands and a summer someone had broken into with a car radio and left a silver song for the frogs to listen to. He went down past a slick of labels that had outlived their words and past a tire somebody had made into a planter for nothing and stopped where the kudzu had failed to perform and left dirt bare in a confession. The hole was black like a pupil and the air above it had a cool that wasn\u2019t generous. He unwound his rope again and this time he tied it to a pine root that had the shoulders for it and he made a test knot low that said if a fool grabbed this it\u2019d hold and he chuckled because he was renewing his ambition to be precisely rude.\n\nThe snapping turtle was there like the spring had promised, an old beast with algae rubbed permanent into his back and eyes that were cruel by design and not intent. Merritt said hello to him in the old way that men used to say hello to monsters they intended to feed and not worship. The turtle lifted his head and set his beak toward Merritt\u2019s shin as if to say come on then, pay rent.\n\n\u201cI got orange peel and pig fat,\u201d Merritt said, because honesty was sometimes the quickest way through. \u201cI am not offering the second to you, because I\u2019m mad at it and I don\u2019t feed my temper. I am offering the first because you will like it, and if you don\u2019t, you will enjoy the novelty of not liking it.\u201d\n\nThe turtle, who in his long life had been fed everything from hot dogs to an engagement ring a girl had hurled and then regretted, accepted the peel and chewed it in a way that made the world feel briefly like a comedy about manners. He looked at Merritt with his old eye and decided for reasons that had nothing to do with human arrangements to move one foot to the left. In the black below, something turned. Merritt went down.\n\nThe hole had edges ridged with crushed glass cemented by time into a new comet. His palms learned those edges and avoided the obvious slashes because this was not the day for blood offerings. The water at the bottom was a plate in a cupboard you forget you have; when you use it, you remember why you bought it. It held cold. It held a single, silly minnow going in a circle like a man who\u2019d been given bad directions his whole life. Merritt put his hand in and the cold hit him in the wrist and wrote in his bones. He hunted by touch because light was an opinion here and one he couldn\u2019t afford to argue with. He found the jar lying on its side in the corner where men who throw have bad aim and gravity is mean. He found its lid, rusted on not completely, gummed with strip. He found the thread nicked in the seal the way someone might tuck a hair under a plate to see if their husband had eaten, old trick wrongfully applied.\n\nHe unscrewed the lid by asking it to trust the grip he had taught it and it did with a little complaining squeal. The worm inside had long ago done what worms do when kept in a jar by ambitious boys who are late and forgetful; it had changed from intention to stain. The thread lay like a vein. He slipped it between two fingers and it shivered with such relief he had to steady them both. He did not smile because that would pull this moment the wrong way. He just stole it back the way you steal a child\u2019s hand in a parking lot and say it\u2019s time to go and the child argues without teeth.\n\nWhen he turned his head to climb the turtle put its face close to his ear and breathed in a way that suggested jealousy and reprieve. Merritt took the hint and leaned his cheek to the old beast and said in the language of scrapes and baths and stories told on porches, Thank you. He did not flatter. He did not name. The turtle thought, if turtles think in words, that this was an acceptable human. He moved his other foot. He considered biting and changed his mind, which is a bigger act of civilization than we give it credit for.\n\nAbove him, the world made a sound like someone rolling dice in a coffee can and that meant the glass was remembering it could move. He didn\u2019t hurry, because one does not when one has hold of breath and thread and dignity. He climbed out and the stars shifted in the bottles as his head passed and for an instant the sky seemed to be a jar and he laughed because he had promised a story and the story had decided to look back at him as if to ask, You and me, then?\n\nHe stepped into his own shadow and shook wet off his hand and tied the thread around the coin that hung at his mouth and the two had a conversation that made his teeth ache in the good way heartbreak done right does. He did not put it in the box at home, because he wasn\u2019t at home, and also because he was beginning to distrust boxes as the answer to constant motion. He tucked it in the pocket over his heart behind three pennies he carried to remind himself of being poor even when he had cash and it lay there with a depth he had not expected. He breathed. The under breathed with him. The dump inhaled and the frogs, generous, sang like a choir that has not been paid and sings anyway and is better for it.\n\nOn his way back to the truck he saw Vespur\u2019s spoor in the dark, not smell this time but absence of smell, a weirdness where the night had refused to carry him any longer and had dropped him like a bad letter. It was in the shape of a man stepping too long on his own guilt. It went into the trees and then across the old road where the tracks had been and then into the trailer park that had been built because men think cheap houses for people they won\u2019t meet is generosity. He could have followed. He did not. He went home because the name in his pocket was heavy and needed to be sat with and because the springs had loaned him grace and he did not want to spend it running.\n\nAt the square the band played and found, halfway through \u201cWagon Wheel,\u201d that their instruments tried to be serious. The drummer couldn\u2019t keep the time he had planned and ended up keeping the time the fountain, now chastened, suggested, and it was better for him though he would argue later. Dobbins, who had practiced a speech about resilience, delivered one about logistics, because he had woken in the afternoon to find the monogram on his towels rearranged to spell a word he couldn\u2019t pronounce. Tansy danced with her baby on her hip and made the baby laugh real this time, the sound not jarred but born, and she set that laugh carefully on top of the day so it couldn\u2019t blow away.\n\nMerritt came up his own steps and the house flexed its warm in a way that didn\u2019t feel like it was trying to sell him anything. He set the thread on the box and then, thinking better, set the box on the thread, and the box liked that and slid, just a hair, in the way a dog will slide toward you if you pretend you\u2019re not asking. He put the kettle on and the kettle boiled and he poured water over coffee and the coffee did the thing where it released its smell like a spell being relieved of duty. He put his hand on the counter and the counter told him about a time his father had stood there drying an apple slice because the power had been out and he\u2019d wanted a snack anyway. He sat and whistled the tune with no words and no room for fear, and though his voice wobbled once it did not break.\n\nWhen the knock came, it was in the polite way of people who don\u2019t knock often because doors are usually open to them. He went and found Rosa with a pie on her hands and Aunt Lydie with eyes that said sleep was a thing men do in other houses. Behind them, Lyle held a bag of ice and looked like a man who wanted to be useful more than he wanted to be right. They stood and didn\u2019t say a single brave thing for a breath that stretched like taffy. Then the baby laughed again from somewhere on the street and the laugh hit the house and the house knew what to do.\n\n\u201cWe ain\u2019t letting you eat alone,\u201d Aunt Lydie said, and walked past him like the door had begged her to be first. Rosa put lemon pie on the table and slid the marlin opener down the nail like she was putting a switchblade away. Lyle put ice in the sink and didn\u2019t trip over the rugs because they\u2019d stopped whispering.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m bringing somebody a story,\u201d Merritt said to the room, and felt the promise sit in it like a new chair that fits everyone. \u201cAnd after that I\u2019m bringing back clean to the parts that Vespur touched. He owes me days. I\u2019m going to make them days you can sleep in, not days so quiet they scratch.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Rosa said. \u201cWe like sleeping. But not too much. We get up mean when we sleep too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to bed after we eat and after we laugh once at a thing that isn\u2019t mean,\u201d Aunt Lydie pronounced, and nobody argued because she had earned that sentence. \u201cTomorrow you and me and that boy with the hat and the baby who laughs are going to go to Mason\u2019s dogs and tell them the under has quit rattling. And then we\u2019re going to make a list of where the stink still is and we\u2019re going to salt it with words and orange and all the other cheap things that cost more than money.\u201d\n\nThey ate and the pie tasted like apology accepted and the coffee held and the night around the house did not bristle. Somewhere Vespur lay in a bed he had not earned and stared at a ceiling that had opinions and thought about debt and how it stung in a place he could not scratch. In the springs, the woman took the jar of names into a crook where clay eats gently and opened it and patted the names like cloth until they forgot what they had been told to be. Under the dump, the turtle settled so his belly touched mud and thought of oranges without wanting them, which for a turtle is progress. Merritt took the thread and his father\u2019s work and braided them in his mouth until one of them became flavor and the other became will, and he slept with the window up so the moss could hear him breathe and know where to bend.Chapter seven woke with the steam that makes a yard look like it is thinking about boiling. The heat was not rude yet; it had its shirt on and was putting its socks in order. Merritt woke with it and lay still for one long breath while the house told him the small night news\u2014a palm rat on the eaves who had reconsidered a career in burglary, the oak making an old joint pop, a train two miles off that had grumbled like a man asked to lift his own couch. The thread lay where he had put it under the box and the two had become comfortable with each other in a way that made him feel like he had introduced right friends. He touched the box\u2019s corner and the cedar gave him back the smell of a coat in winter, which in Florida is a fancy habit you keep for a week and then put away generous.\n\nCoffee made the kitchen practical. It hissed like a cat you\u2019d stepped near and then purred because you had gotten the distance right. Aunt Lydie had left behind a good dish towel, the woven kind from a church fair that remembers hands, and he used it to dry his cup and then folded it neat out of respect for how it had come to him. He took his hat off its hook and tucked the marlin opener in his pocket because it had been agreeable the day before and a man would be a fool not to take agreeable along. When he stepped onto the porch, the light came up from the dirt as much as it came down from the sky, and he liked that, liked a day that met him halfway.\n\nThey met at Mason\u2019s because that was how it had been decided when words were short and hands were busy. Mason\u2019s place had the look of a house that had held its breath during a storm and had been told afterward it could breathe and had said, Maybe later. The dogs out front\u2014a pair of brindly creatures that had raccoon in their eyebrows and saint in their ribs\u2014saw Merritt and seen the others and did the complicated tail calculus that says I\u2019m happy, I don\u2019t like this, you brought treats, and you smell like trouble\u2019s dentist. They would not go under the house. They would not go near the steps. They stood and arched their necks and put their noses toward the shadow and told it, We got teeth, but also, We got good sense.\n\nMason stood with his thumbs in his belt loops like a man holding a story in place. He had sleep in his beard and a kindness in his eyes that had put up with more than he ought. \u201cI tried to sweet-talk \u2018em,\u201d he said by way of greeting. \u201cI sang that dumb song they like about the cat and the bird, and I tucked bacon just inside and they said I could eat it myself like a fool. Don\u2019t tell my wife I wasted bacon. I\u2019ll deny it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will not mention bacon except as a philosophical concept,\u201d Aunt Lydie said, stepping onto the first step with her bell clutched in the curve of her arm like a baby you do not hand to folks unless they have proven they can keep their hands low. Rosa, efficient without making you feel scolded for not being so, had a bucket with salt, another with water, a handful of rosemary that wasn\u2019t really for this but smelled like it ought to help. Lyle had his hat on back and a flashlight he had not turned on because he was a Florida boy and knew the difference between light and glare.\n\nMerritt crouched. He did not squint into the orange shade because he wasn\u2019t trying to see a person hiding; he was listening for a house pretending not to gossip. The crawlspace breathed cool, but that was just shade being generous. The smell was layered wrong: damp wood and the good stink of a dog\u2019s belly, the tang of old iron nails, and under that a cheap sweet like a spilled soda that had been wiped up with lies. A lacing of pig fat marks along the joists, sure, but they had been half-hearted, like a man who\u2019d cheated off another man\u2019s paper and gotten the answers wrong in order to not look too neat. This wasn\u2019t just Vespur\u2019s little coins. This was a nest.\n\n\u201cThey built themselves a lair under your kitchen,\u201d Merritt said, and the word was too proud for what the thing was, but he gave it anyway so it would show itself to grin. \u201cA stink-eater with babies. He put it there so you\u2019d step over the smell when you came in, and it would eat your cooking smoke and grow smart on it and tell your pan when to burn eggs. That\u2019s rude.\u201d\n\nMason scrubbed his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me what it looks like so I can have the proper kind of nightmare later?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks like a wet wasp nest taught to breathe,\u201d Merritt said kindly. \u201cDon\u2019t go near it with a broom. It will come apart like old bread and then it will be in your sinuses. We are going to coax it out with food and then we are going to salt its feet and then we are going to send it where it can eat ditch and not cook.\u201d\n\nHe took the orange he had in his bag and peeled it in one long strip because that pleased him and wrapped the peel around the blue rope and let the oil jump like ideas. He didn\u2019t put salt in his mouth; he wasn\u2019t a sailor. He took out the mirror shard and angled it to make a door of light just past the lip of shadow and then he tied the rope around a brick and slid it under in a way that suggested a hand offering a plate and not a trap. The dogs watched, offended and impressed. Rosa went around to the other side and hummed a grocery list under her breath because that\u2019s how you keep ordinary in the air when a thing comes that wants to make everything special wrong.\n\nWhen it moved, it didn\u2019t skitter. It didn\u2019t need legs to do that. It rolled like a fog that got ideas. It found the mirror and tried to be it and failed; the mirror was itself and that is a stubborn position. It lifted on one side and he saw the line of a jar lid and the soggy teeth set along an edge and he said, \u201cNo thank you,\u201d to the part of his mind that wanted to get a stick and jab. The babies rode the mother\u2019s back in snotty little humps that made sound like refrigerator hum heard through a bad dream. The smell lifted with it, tired milk and damp newspaper and the last of a song stuck in a bathroom where a man had shaved badly.\n\nHe snapped the rope. The snap went across the thing and told it it was being rude. It folded, not away but down, and then came out, unhappy about the sun, and he had salt in his hand and he flung it like a man tossing rice at a wedding he suspected was a mistake and the salt hit the front of the blob and made it hiss and split and consider. He did not scatter it. He tapped it with his name and told it the ditch two houses down needed its skills. He made the ditch sound like a job with benefits. The thing opened the part of itself that was an ear and wanted praise and he praised it for eating what humans leave and he said, \u201cGo on, now,\u201d and it went, heavy and silly, babies clinging like gossip.\n\nThe dogs relaxed like a knot coming loose and then, in embarrassment at having relaxed, barked three times at a cricket saying, Look what we did. Mason exhaled a whole story of a sigh. Aunt Lydie blew her bell quiet, the note at the bottom like the sound a jar makes when you take its lid off and it was never meant to open and it\u2019s relieved you did. Rosa took the rosemary and tucked a sprig under the step and said, \u201cFor you,\u201d to the house, and the house said, I will remember you when your hands are tired.\n\n\u201cYou give it the ditch with the ragweed,\u201d Mason said, peering like a man who\u2019s going to write the story bigger tonight for effect and then tell the true version to his wife and hope she lets him keep both.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll keep the mosquitoes from thinking they own that corner,\u201d Merritt said. He patted the shade with two fingers. \u201cDon\u2019t go putting bacon down here no more. That\u2019s my professional advice and my personal plea.\u201d\n\nThey drove up to Juniper with the windows down, the heat now with its shirt in its hand and talkative. Juniper sat the way places sit when they have been pretty too long and learned to expect kindness. The ranger at the little booth recognized Aunt Lydie\u2019s hand at the wheel and waved them in with the concerned camaraderie of a man whose job is watching strangers love his water too hard. The green there has a different vocabulary, longer and stalkier. The smell was clean over the surface, but in the shadows under the thick fern hang there was a taste of sour. A man in a hat you buy when someone tells you there\u2019s a sale had said earlier that his picnic had gone slick under his hands and he\u2019d blamed humidity until his ham had tasted like a coin.\n\nJuniper\u2019s wrong was not Vespur\u2019s, though he had shaken the place. This was old, like the spring woman had told him, a stripe of iron gone into the muscle long back and never worked out. The boardwalk planks here had different tongues than Silver\u2019s, and they argued less. He went to the place he always did, a bend where light made decisions, and put his hand low, fingers in the water so the little fish could come bump him like cousins asking if he brought the good ice. He talked low because the forest liked that. He told them about the iron grate at Silver and the turtle and the jar in the dump and he felt the way news goes under, the long lazy roll that says someone in a room far off doing book-keeping looks up and says, Oh, that\u2019s why the numbers haven\u2019t matched.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not coughing,\u201d Lyle said, as if he\u2019d been bracing for it. He looked pale under the brim. He loved this place privately and wore it like a shirt under his uniform so people wouldn\u2019t think him frivolous.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s holding breath,\u201d Merritt said, and the woman under here did not come up the way the other had; she pushed a handprint up in ripples on the surface and he saw his own hand match it and that was hello enough. \u201cWe stole a fork out of her meat yesterday. Today we convince her she doesn\u2019t have to flinch when a shadow looks like that fork.\u201d\n\nThey salted not the water but the air, which you can do if you\u2019ve learned the trick and don\u2019t waste it on showing off. He breathed orange through his teeth and told a story of a day this week when nobody slipped in a kitchen and the children didn\u2019t throw sand in each other\u2019s hair but did eat sandwiches and remembered to close the bread without being told. Rosa, who had never liked Juniper because of a thing that had happened here when she was nine that she never told long and didn\u2019t need to, squared her shoulders and put her fingers on the rail and let the planks know she forgave them for the day and asked them to try again. Things stopped sticking. The sour shifted from now to then. A man with a sale hat smiled at his ham without knowing why and gave his wife the last bite, and later she would tell him he was sweet and he would say he wasn\u2019t but they\u2019d keep the tone, which is the point.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m counting a day,\u201d Merritt said under his breath on the way back to the truck, so the debt could hear him and not that he minded Lyle hearing too. \u201cHe owes them, and he is paying them like a man who pays in coins that jingle loud so people see him. Fine. I\u2019ll take loud. Quiet isn\u2019t always a blessing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think he\u2019s paying attention to the county calendar?\u201d Lyle asked. He wanted everything to make sense even when it didn\u2019t, which was reasonable for a man whose job was to fit things to forms.\n\n\u201cI think debt has its own reminder system,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cIt pinches the joint when the weather changes. He\u2019ll feel it if he tries to be bad. He\u2019ll be bad anyway. That\u2019s who he is. But he\u2019ll cough in the middle of his own curse. I\u2019ll hear it.\u201d\n\nDobbins caught them on the square like a man catching grasshoppers\u2014the stance, the surprise when one jumps wrong. He had a clipboard to make his hands look occupied and the bow tie he wore when he needed to remind people he was a person and not a man who liked to count taxes. \u201cMr. Harker,\u201d he said, keeping his eyes left of Merritt\u2019s ear like always, a habit born once out of superstition and now out of stubbornness. \u201cI need to discuss liability with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can discuss it while we move tables,\u201d Merritt said, lifting one end of a sad folding table in the shadow of the courthouse that had seen a hundred summers and had judged a hundred idiots, some gently, some not. \u201cYour fountains are behaving. Your square is a square. If we put a story here tonight, it\u2019ll lay flat. You want to be helpful? Sign the paper that says when we bring something ugly here it won\u2019t be counted as a festival unless you arrange a food truck.\u201d\n\nDobbins blinked, and that meant he was buying what he was being sold while trying to pretend he wasn\u2019t. \u201cBring something ugly here? My constituents\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYour constituency breathes what you breathe,\u201d Rosa said, clean as a knife. She had a lemon print scarf around her neck and it made her look like common sense. \u201cThe spring was holding iron. It was our iron. We took it. We\u2019re bringing up the next section when we can. You\u2019re going to help us carry it down Main Street one evening soon. We will lay it on your courthouse steps. You\u2019ll say a thing that doesn\u2019t make excuses. You will stand and you will listen to old ladies hum when they don\u2019t have words. That\u2019s my professional recommendation.\u201d She didn\u2019t have a profession besides making things grow and making men correct themselves with a look, but Dobbins accepted the word for lack of a better one.\n\nLyle was trying not to grin. Mason, who had come to town on the theory that his dogs ought to see a place where pigeons live on pretzel diets, nodded from under a tree and said, to no one and to everyone, \u201cIt would be a good story. People like to carry things if they\u2019re heavy enough to make everybody walk funny. It gives them something to do with their backs.\u201d\n\nDobbins smoothed the paper on his clipboard and his mouth made shape around words that began with regret and ended with growth and got stuck on the way. He was not a bad man; he was a careful one, and careful had mistaken itself for righteous a dozen times in his life and he was trying to teach it manners. \u201cIf we do this,\u201d he said, quietly because the town heard it when mayors get honest and he preferred doing that in rooms with carpet, \u201cif we lay iron on those steps, we don\u2019t get to pretend our water was always for fun. We invite people to say true things. We invite\u2026refuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe flush it,\u201d Merritt said, and the word came out tidy because he meant it in both senses. \u201cWe tell the story before it tells itself in the wrong mouths. We make air. Also, you get to be in the picture later when the paper says Ocala did a hard thing. That\u2019s good politics and I won\u2019t even charge you for that advice.\u201d\n\nDobbins snorted and thought about tearing the paper to give his hands an action and then took his pen and signed like a man who had written his name on checks he didn\u2019t want to cash and then stood anyway in the bank line with his hat in his hands. \u201cDon\u2019t make me regret it,\u201d he said, but he aimed it at the sky in case it had ears for trivial mayoral drama and not at Merritt because he knew who was likely to do the regretting.\n\nThe day sagged into that late afternoon lull where everything that isn\u2019t human knows to be quiet and humans answer by turning on radios. Merritt took himself home long enough to sit on the steps with Tansy and a sweating glass of tea and listen to her describe in exact terms how the world would improve if people would stop tying balloons to mailboxes in this heat. The baby slept like a decision. Vespur\u2019s shadow was not on the road. Merritt could feel his tug, though, a string strummed not hard but constant, out past the old forestry road where the kudzu made new architecture at will. The debt had him, and he had found a way to enjoy even that. Merritt spat a little lemon seed into the yard and the yard accepted it like a secret.\n\nNight came with its frog choir and the tree toad soloists and the chuckle of men half-full of beer and the sigh of women whose ankles had had enough. Merritt took the thread out and did the thing he had been putting off because it felt like art and he never trusted his hands there: he braided it into the band of his hat, quick, unshowy, three over three, and it lay there like it had been waiting on that braid since his father had been a boy whom no one had tied it for. He felt less worried about the box now. Boxes are not wrong, but when a thing wants to go you have to make room for it where things move.\n\nThe springs did not cough. They sent breeze through the park sandwiches and gave a second life to two balloons that had sagged and then thought better. Merritt drove out to the dump for a last check because the woman under had asked him to be quick and he suspected she preferred tidy. The snapping turtle was on his log dreaming industrial dreams. The jar he had freed had sunk again, respectable now, serving as a house for something with legs too many and ambition none. He felt eyes on him and did not turn because some watches are courtesy, not threat, and you don\u2019t embarrass courtesy by catching it.\n\nHalfway back, near the taxidermist, he smelled the ginned-up rot again, thin but there, and knew Vespur had come through, debt pinching. He pulled over because the smell came not from the ditch or the air but from his own chest, and he said, out loud because that sometimes clears a hallway, \u201cI know what you are doing, and I am doing something else. Go on and pay your quiet like a man pays a tab. Don\u2019t be clever. It doesn\u2019t fit you as well as you think.\u201d In response, something in the palmettos coughed twice, the kind of cough that means a man has tried to hold breath and is punished by his own body. Merritt smiled and hated that he liked the sound, because he didn\u2019t want to enjoy hurt, even earned.\n\nThe story for the spring sat with him like a guest waiting to see if he\u2019d offer a second biscuit before dinner. He had promised one that hadn\u2019t happened. He knew the shape of it now: men and women, old and young, carrying iron in their hands and on their shoulders, their faces making that look a person gets when they are doing something embarrassing and correct. He knew the lady at the newspaper would take pictures and he knew which picture would be kept and which would get used online and how the difference would be a whole graduate thesis someday. He knew Dobbins would kiss a baby he didn\u2019t know and curse himself for it because it would look crass and he would then go home and hold his own sleep-heavy child and ask forgiveness from a God who hadn\u2019t been paying attention in a decade but would tonight because of bells.\n\nHe needed bells. He needed too many. He called Aunt Lydie. She picked up on the first ring because she already had the phone in her hand and was waiting to call him but had decided not to in order to teach the phone they were in charge of it. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, not hello. \u201cWe are going to need to borrow from churches. Which ones owe us favors?\u201d\n\n\u201cSt. Elm\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cThey use my rosemary for their Easter lamb. The Pentecostal out on 40 because I told Brother Hart how to keep his well from tasting of coins. Tansy says she can ring dead bells. Ask her to come stand on the courthouse steps and do that without scaring the babies. Rosa will make lemonade that tastes like the answer to a question gently asked. Lyle will put boys at the corners and ask them to stand still which will be the biggest miracle we work all night.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you,\u201d Aunt Lydie said, softer, which meant she was about to throw one of those truths in his lap and walk away, because she had learned how to be kind with a straight back. \u201cYou are going to stand and tell them about the iron and about the jar and about the man who put your daddy on your bed. You are not going to make him the center. You are going to make the work the center. If you call another man by his wrong name, it gives him air. You put your hands on the work. You talk about it like loving. People understand that. It is the story and it will do.\u201d\n\nHe leaned his head back and let the roof of the cab hold him a second and thought about the way a braid feels when you get it right and your fingers stop arguing with time. \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d he said. \u201cHe can run circles like a rodeo. I can lay a line.\u201d\n\nThe plan got legs with an ease that told him it was the right size for the town. He didn\u2019t have to push; he had to steer. Dobbins surprised him twice by seeing ahead of a problem and by not insisting on a podium that would get splinters in old women\u2019s palms. Mason brought a dolly with one wheel that didn\u2019t work and then fixed the wheel on the courthouse steps with a satisfaction that redeemed half the sins men have committed with wrenches. The boys Lyle set at corners went solemn at the weight in the air and forgot to look at their phones because sometimes people are better when no one is grading them.\n\nNight gathered glass into its pockets. The spring held its blue down low like a woman tucking her slip because she was not confident of the dress. Merritt stood on the steps and saw faces he loved and faces he did not know and faces he\u2019d argued with and faces he\u2019d kissed and one face he\u2019d punched in ninth grade and they all had their mouths pursed in that way people get when trying not to chew on their own pride. He held the hat that had his father\u2019s thread in it, not up like a banner but down like a promise. He felt Vespur watching in the way a rat watches, not out of malice\u2014rats are not evil\u2014out of that specialization that says, Who brings the cheese and what do I owe it later.\n\nHe spoke plain. He didn\u2019t turn his voice pretty or rough. He told them about iron in a throat, about jars that carried names where names go to curdle, about a blue rope and a bell and a turtle who negotiated fair. He said Vespur\u2019s name once in the dirt of his mouth and not again. He said his father\u2019s work twice and didn\u2019t say his name at all. He said, \u201cWe carried iron there and we\u2019re going to carry iron here and everyone who takes hold of it will know how it feels to correct something you didn\u2019t do and are responsible for anyway,\u201d and he left the sentence there for people to climb on.\n\nThey carried. The bars were heavier in story than in steel, which is the proper way round, because a man can always get help to lift a bar but it\u2019s harder with the other. The grunt went up from the group the way geese talk to each other in flight\u2014low reassurance, a check-in that requires no answer. Aunt Lydie rang her bell once, long and low, and Tansy let hers chime in that way only she heard, a ghost line for anyone who needed one. Dobbins did not speak, bless him. He took his end and he moved and when it was done he stepped back and let other men talk. Rosa held a paper cup to every palm that needed to shake and Lyle looked at the corners and decided no boy would need to be told twice to keep their feet down tonight.\n\nAfter, when the iron sat there cooling like a bread pan and the courthouse steps took its imprint into their confidence, Merritt felt the debt move under his ribs in the way debts do when they have had a payment, not satisfied but willing to stop tapping their watch. The woman under would like this story. It would improve the air. He imagined telling her and he imagined her saying only, Yes, because she was not a god and did not clap.\n\nHe went home with the sweetness of lemon and sweat in his shirt and set his hat on the hook and touched the braid and the braid hummed like a fence line not singing, just being itself the way it is when you\u2019ve tied it right. He sat at the table and a moth made a spiral at the light and tapped the shade like a very tiny bell bringing in the very last of the day\u2019s stragglers. Outside, the bottle tree sang three notes of its own accord because the wind told it a joke and it didn\u2019t have words to tell it back. He put his hands on the wood and the wood remembered everything it had held that day and did not ask for more. He closed his eyes and tried to sleep and instead found his mother\u2019s tune and held it and if he dreamed, it was of iron left in the sun until old hands could warm themselves on it without getting burned.Chapter nine came in like a fan on low, steady and a little apologetic, moving the heat around instead of beating it. The quiet Vespur owed had held for eight days in a row, which was a miracle by any county\u2019s accounting and a torment by his. Quiet looks different when you\u2019ve had noise. Folks caught themselves listening for the stink the way you listen for a whippoorwill after you\u2019ve got used to the song, and when it didn\u2019t come they pretended they hadn\u2019t been braced and went about their doing. Merritt woke into that hush with a feeling like his bones had been filed true. The house told him nothing of great solemnity: a blue jay had dropped a pecan on the porch rail and missed; an ant had found a seam of sugar on the counter and been persuaded to try the yard instead; the bottle tree had dreamt of glass with sea still in it. He lay and counted the breaths between cicada phrases and thought, If he is paying, he is saving to spend.\n\nBy noon the phone had made three small rattles and one long hum, all of them men telling him ordinary things with the unusual threaded through. Mason\u2019s wife said the good towels had gone soft like they\u2019d been washed in rainwater and she took it as a sign to be kind to her sister. Tansy said she had heard her dead bells at exactly seven and then again at seven-oh-seven and asked if that meant a joke or an error, and when he asked her what the bells sounded like she said they were shy this time, like a child practicing its name in a mirror. Lyle\u2019s voice was the long hum, which meant he had stayed calm for a while and then decided he had earned the right to be not. \u201cStorm drains are singing,\u201d he said, and then said, \u201cI know that sounds like you, but I mean it literal. Boys on skateboards say the grates make a chord when they go by. Also, manhole covers sweating. Also, two cats sitting and staring into the same hole like it owes them money. I\u2019ll send you a picture if you ask nice.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t send me a picture,\u201d Merritt said, putting coffee on the stove and the towel over his shoulder because it made him feel like he was the kind of man kitchens confide in. \u201cMeet me by the old feed store. The alley there\u2019s low and it collects everybody\u2019s ideas of drainage. Bring a boy who knows not to fall down, and bring a broom like you mean it.\u201d\n\nThe alley had a personality like old socks, but it had its uses. Folks had been pushing rain that way for a hundred years and the ground had learned to be grateful. The grate by the downspout did indeed have a tone, a low one that wanted to be kind and kept getting interrupted by an edge. Lyle tested it with the toe of his boot and made the sound wobble, and the boy beside him\u2014Hector, the one who was quiet until he wasn\u2019t and then had useful opinions about engines\u2014tilted his head and nodded solemnly like a man listening to an engine he planned to forgive. Merritt crouched and put his ear to the iron and let it say its piece. Under the sound there was a taste, and under that a habit, and under that a decision somebody had made who\u2019d never had call to use the word municipal. The drains had begun to learn harmony. They were not good at it. They were trying to sing through a mouthful of rags.\n\nHe unrolled the blue rope and unwound three oranges he\u2019d put in his bag without thinking and then congratulated himself for the part of his brain that planned ahead while he slept. He cut the peel in long strips and laid them on the iron until the oil came up cheap and bright, and the smell pushed a little at the sour. He touched the mirror shard to the grate and the grate looked at itself the way a person does when they catch their reflection in a shop window and aren\u2019t ready to own it. The tone steadied. He could feel the ditch behind the taxidermist down the street perk up, hungry as ever and not picky about source. \u201cWe\u2019re going to give this alley something else to love,\u201d he said, and wrapped the rope around the grate and tied a knot a child could undo and then a knot a sailor would approve and then a knot of his own invention that said, No more surprises.\n\nThe thing in the throat of the drain rolled and tasted the orange and backed up like a cat caught off guard appreciating a new smell. It wasn\u2019t malicious. It was a wet mind with a job that had been badly described to it. Vespur had sent it formally, with pig fat and a handful of pennies and a lie about purpose, and it had believed with the earnestness of small organisms. \u201cYou get the ragweed ditch,\u201d Merritt told it, not cruel, not bribing; he really did have something better to offer. \u201cIt\u2019s full of paper cups and old shade and sometimes bacon if Mason\u2019s wife has a guest she likes. You go police that and grow smart on it and leave this alley to its own nonsense. We\u2019ll leave you oranges if you prove you can be polite.\u201d\n\nIt tested him, because anything with teeth does, even if the teeth are only a habit of clinging. It sent up a rope of smell and wrapped it around the boy\u2019s ankle as if to see if men could be tripped into meanness. Hector stood very still, which was the right choice when the ground tries to make you do slapstick. Merritt snapped the rope in his hand and the snap traveled down like a hard no. He felt Vespur\u2019s hand on the other end, light as a lie told in passing, and he felt Vespur pull back not because he was chastened but because he had other threads in his fingers and could not afford to get them tangled. The thing rolled off into the ditch the way a bad idea leaves your mouth when you see your aunt in the doorway, and the grate sighed like furniture. The tone went true. Lyle shouldered the broom in relief as if it had been his part of the work all along. The boy grinned and said nothing, but later he would tell his mother he had watched a man ask a drain to behave and it had and she would say, That\u2019s a good use of a Tuesday.\n\nBack at the house Aunt Lydie had her map out, which did not look like a map so much as a quilt that had learned to be administrative. She had put pins in it for places that were paid, places that owed, and places that didn\u2019t believe in accounting yet and would have to be taught. She was muttering to herself and to three skeleton keys she had laid on the table with a kind of exasperated fondness. \u201cChurch keys,\u201d she said when he came in, and when he smiled because he could count a joke as quick as the next man she clucked at him without meanness. \u201cNo. Real ones. St. Elm\u2019s, Hart\u2019s, and the First Practice House they built for a congregation that never got past the number twelve. He left jars there like he left jars in that truck. You go ahead and don\u2019t be surprised. If he can\u2019t have an audience he\u2019ll make a rehearsal.\u201d\n\nHe whistled the kettle to boil and set out two cups because when Aunt Lydie had keys on the table she wasn\u2019t leaving for a minute. She gave him the shape of the thing she had seen in the seams of the day: not a revival, exactly, but a calling up of breath. Vespur wanted to make the town take a breath together, in a place he chose, at a time he chose, and then make the exhale be his, a ribbon he could step on and say, See, dance for me. He had put jars under pews to teach the wood to remember cheap hymns and under the air returns to make the smell go round and round like praise that had lost its words. He had put a flier up at the Fox and Oak for a thing he had named with irritating accuracy: Blessing of the Air. Rosa had pulled one of the fliers down and brought it folded and sour to the table. It had a smudge that looked like someone had pressed an orange slice to it out of spite and he liked Rosa better for that if that were possible.\n\n\u201cSkate rink,\u201d he read, because of course it was. The place had been abandoned when the county decided children ought to learn to make their own fun without supervision. The rink had floors that still hummed in straight lines and corners where prayers had been whispered with hands on the back pockets of jeans. It had a low ceiling that had learned to be a sky. \u201cHe wants to use the fans.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants the fans to use us,\u201d Aunt Lydie said dry, and flicked the smallest key with a fingernail. \u201cHe owes you quiet. He is making himself a place to spend his noise. He won\u2019t wait until the debt is done. He never has. He never will. We will do air work tonight, and we will keep people from associating his name with fresh. You bring your rope. You bring your mirror. You bring whatever you use when you aren\u2019t sure if you\u2019re going to have to be rude.\u201d\n\n\u201cI bring my marlin,\u201d he said, patting his pocket, and she shook her head like a woman and a mother and an aunt all at once, amused and resigned to loving a fool when he\u2019s right.\n\nThe rink smelled like a locker room had married a carnival and not told their parents. The parking lot had acquired pine straw in drifts that made men look thoughtful about rakes. The front door had been kept shut by a chain put through its handles and then undone by a bolt cutter sometime last week by hands that had wanted to be helpful to the wrong cause. There were posters still up for themed nights that had never happened and a trophy case with three trophies, none of which had names attached anymore because names in cases slip off when nobody looks. Under all that, in the HVAC, in the vents, in the gap under the DJ booth, the wrong breathed.\n\nPeople had come. People always come when a man says he\u2019s going to bless something and charges a donation. They came because the day had felt like a coat that didn\u2019t quite fit and because someone had used words like cool and free and because there was a table in the corner with a punch bowl and a woman who had been told to smile. Merritt watched their faces and saw nothing he didn\u2019t recognize: a man who had worked in the sun all day and wanted a different kind of sweat, a woman who had been alone too long this week and needed to be near the sound of other people\u2019s shoes, a pair of teenagers who\u2019d come because anywhere with a ceiling and no parents is a church of its own. He saw Vespur at the far end of the room and would have known him even if the smell hadn\u2019t sewn itself into the light.\n\nVespur had cleaned up for the occasion. He had combed his hair and patted down his coat and put a flower in his lapel that did not deserve the company it kept. He had a microphone, not because he needed one but because he wanted one; he liked the way his voice sounded when bounced off electronics. The jars were under the bleachers, lined with care, and the air returns had been garlanded with burlap that had a smell like barns that weren\u2019t honest. He had put his organ back together with borrowed parts, and the fans were his pipes. He saw Merritt and the smile that cracked his face was complicated, not triumph, not even gloat, but a kind of affection for worthy opposition that would read as condescension in weaker men and was a present in this one.\n\n\u201cYou came to breathe,\u201d he said into the mic, and the speakers turned his voice into a version of thunder for people who had never been outside in a storm. \u201cThat\u2019s good. People forget how. I will teach you. It will be clean. It will be easy. It will be me and you and the air between deciding to behave.\u201d\n\nMerritt had his rope out in his hands and it looked like a belt to anyone else, which was fine. He had four box fans too, borrowed from behind the feed store and from Lyle\u2019s garage and from Rosa\u2019s nursery, and he set them in the corners on chairs and cut lemons in front of them until the air started to look like it had remembered kitchens where nobody cried. Aunt Lydie set her keys on the ledge at the back and put salt in their mouths so if a door tried to open that wasn\u2019t theirs it would get a mouthful of ocean and reconsider. Tansy stood on the middle of the floor with the baby on her hip and her spoon in her hand because she had said once irons made her think of scars and she saw no need to rile herself on purpose. She looked like a woman about to stir a pot and instead stirred the air by standing the way you do when you\u2019re ready for whatever.\n\nVespur began with kindness, which was his slyest move. \u201cIn,\u201d he said, and the crowd did, and there is nothing wrong with synchrony when it is offered, but his voice had in it a suggestion that the exhale belonged to him. \u201cOut,\u201d he said, and the vents pulled because somebody at the power panel had been co-opted into evil and given a story about electricity that made him feel useful. Merritt listened and waited. He did not want to scold a room out of a breath that was theirs to take. He put the mirror on the floor and picked up the rope and tied knots that looked like decoration and then breathed through his teeth so the lemons would help. He tasted the quarter and it shocked his mouth back on purpose.\n\nIt broke when Vespur tried to say a name he shouldn\u2019t have. He lifted his hand for the third breath to ride on and he said, \u201cBoy,\u201d and it was the way he had made it sound at the phone, the way he had put it on the bed, the way he had tried to make Merritt hop. But the thread in Merritt\u2019s hat band hummed, not loud, just honest, and the bell in Aunt Lydie\u2019s pocket answered, and Tansy shook her spoon once and the baby on her hip laughed in a way that stripped paint off old fear. The room hiccuped like a congregation correcting an off-key hymn by singing louder on the next line. Merritt stepped into the aisle and raised his own hand and clapped out a rhythm that he had used on a mare and at a porch and in a kitchen when a kettle hadn\u2019t wanted to cooperate. It was a rhythm with clapping built in, the old songs. People looked at him, because he wasn\u2019t on the stage and the stage wasn\u2019t working, and then they looked at each other. The teenagers started first because they weren\u2019t jaded. The old men joined because they remembered. People clapped, not loud, not angry, steady, and with the clapping the room decided to be itself.\n\nVespur laughed, because of course he did, and tried to ride the clapping by counting wrong. He gestured and the jars under the bleachers did their trick, humming at a griefy frequency that makes tears think they have errands, and Merritt brought his rope down low and snapped and the snap made a seam in the sound big enough for civility to walk through. The fans took lemon and carried it to the vents and the vents, which had wanted to be praised and had been taught to be used, reconsidered the size of the job. Rosa, over by the punch, had quietly tipped a bowl of rosemary into the nearest return and the smell took up arms for the living. Lyle saw the man at the power panel and stood near him, not threatening, not not, the official weight of law acting as ballast on a night that wanted to get away from itself.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me be mean,\u201d Merritt said, and he said it not to Vespur but to the room, which had the power to decide whether men had to resort to that kind of work. \u201cBreathe if you want to. Don\u2019t if you won\u2019t. Clap if you can. If you can\u2019t, stamp your foot. If you can\u2019t, blink. We will do this together and we will not put anyone in charge of anyone\u2019s lungs.\u201d\n\nThe room believed him because you cannot fake that tone, you can only maintain or fail it. The breath broke up into human sizes. The clapping made the jars under the bleachers show themselves by vibrating a fraction out of their line, and Hector and two other boys on borrowed courage crawled under and dragged them out and handed them to Rosa who set them open under the fans where lemon and rosemary and ordinary air could speak to their contents. The sound changed from a pulse to a murmur people could ignore if they wanted. Vespur\u2019s face peeled back to a frown like a man\u2019s hand getting stuck in a jar when he\u2019d thought he knew the trick and didn\u2019t.\n\nHe stepped off the stage because he knew stages were dangerous when not his. He came straight for Merritt, which was a kind of courtesy if you looked at it sideways. The two of them took the middle of the floor and the town widened itself around them like a skirt. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to enjoy yourself,\u201d Vespur said, close enough that the lemon on his breath made the stink tell on itself. \u201cYou get things done. You don\u2019t ever get tired of being right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI get tired of being interrupted,\u201d Merritt said, and pressed the quarter to Vespur\u2019s sternum, not his forehead this time because this wasn\u2019t about thought. This was about breath. He held it there, through coat and flower and all the ways Vespur had padded himself against consequence, and he said quietly enough that only the man and the air between them heard, \u201cPay. Don\u2019t try to tip with nonsense. Days. In order. No more spending my mornings while you make your evenings interesting.\u201d\n\nVespur gasped, not theater but a little, the coin burning old promises back through his flesh like a book being read aloud backward briefly. He grinned because he always could when a man would be gnashing teeth. \u201cYou going to put me on a cross next?\u201d he asked, sharp. \u201cLay me on your steps? Name me in your prayers? You love me. I make you into the man you want to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a mirror I don\u2019t hang in my house,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cYou\u2019re a tool I don\u2019t let kids near. You\u2019re a lesson I won\u2019t let be the last one. Breathe on your own time.\u201d He took his hand away not because he was done but because the coin needed to sit and hum without being held. He felt it grip through coat and into bone and the hum rolled out like a ripple catching more ripples by the shoulder and lining them up. Vespur\u2019s knees said a sentence that had the word interest in it and he bent a fraction like a man reconsidering pride in public.\n\nThe last blade was small, because he didn\u2019t have room for a big one. That was Vespur\u2019s genius: making small cuts look like luck. He pumped his mic hand once as if by habit and the speakers coughed with the baby cry again, that jarred note he kept in his throat for when a decent man needed to be tripped. It went through the room like a rumor. Three women turned their heads by instinct, Tansy\u2019s baby, down by her knee now fussing with a shoe string, blinked and frowned like he had been drafted and didn\u2019t appreciate it. Merritt didn\u2019t move. He let the cry land and die where it ought to, as a trick heard and not believed. The town watched his shoulders, saw they didn\u2019t jump, and took their cue like a choir takes pitch from the alto because the alto is tired of waiting on the tenor.\n\nIt could have gone longer. It didn\u2019t need to. Once the fans had made the air remember itself and the jars had been opened and forgiven, the rink lost interest in being a church. It went back to remembering corners where a person had been kissed and had decided about who they were without using a sermon for it. The crowd unwove without anyone calling it, and people shook their hands and said their good nights and took paper cups into the parking lot to throw in a can somebody had thought to set by the door. The teens stayed to the very end because they wanted to see if the adults would break, and when the adults didn\u2019t and instead stacked chairs and laughed at each other in a way that made you want to live to be forty, the teens filed the night as a data point that people can be useful without being boring.\n\nVespur stood by the DJ booth, one hand on it like he was a boy steadying himself after getting out on deep water. He breathed, because he had to, and the coin vibrated sternum to spine. He looked at Merritt with a melancholy he didn\u2019t often let show. \u201cYou\u2019ll pick up everything I spill,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll do it until your back gives. You\u2019ll make an art of it and nobody will clap after a while because they\u2019ll forget the tricks are hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t need to clap,\u201d Merritt said, and this time he let the meanness show not in words but in willingness to stand and not soften. \u201cI don\u2019t need you either. But you need me, and that\u2019s your hurt.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Vespur said, and he pushed off the booth and the stink came up from where he had kept it too long in a pocket and he let it go, a small mercy for himself, and the room shrugged and opened the door and it went outside where night collected bad habits and let the good ones sleep. \u201cMaybe I need you to be worth hating. That\u2019s a spice too.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can cook with salt,\u201d Aunt Lydie said as she came up to stand beside Merritt, her bell dangling slack with that pleased heaviness bells get when they\u2019ve rung enough for one kitchen. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to use meat that\u2019s turned. Go home.\u201d\n\nVespur left like a man leaving a bar at closing time without having paid for his drinks but having left his name written under the table for the next man to find. He did not look back. He didn\u2019t have to. He left his debt walking in front of him like a big dog you can\u2019t leash because you\u2019ve convinced yourself it loves you. The room rolled its shoulders and settled. The fans spun out the last of the lemon and then made do with night.\n\nOn the way out Tansy caught Merritt\u2019s sleeve with the spoon hand and said, \u201cYou felt that?\u201d and he said he had, and she said, \u201cDead bells got confused and then they got curious. Curious is better. It means we can teach. I\u2019ll be at St. Elm\u2019s in the morning if you want me to count pews with my ears and tell you which ones talk back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll count together,\u201d he said. \u201cBring the boy. He claps on time. That\u2019s a gift.\u201d\n\nHe drove around the long way to his house because the roads like to be checked on before bed and because he wanted to feel the town do its own breathing without help. It did. The ditch with the ragweed burbled, pleased with its surprise snack, and he put an orange peel there like a tip and the water preened. The bottle tree whispered to him as he passed, glass bright in the moon, and he whispered back because some courtesies feel necessary even when you are tired. He parked and got out and the porch boards gave him that extra bounce they always did when he came home in one piece, and he stood a second and waited to see if the house had advice. It didn\u2019t. It was content, which is a rarer state than joy and more durable.\n\nHe took the hat down and fingered the braid. The thread hummed like a wire that has been tightened properly after a long time of sagging. He could feel there was still a knot somewhere else, not in Vespur\u2019s pocket anymore, not in the dump jar, not under his bed pretending innocence. He thought about the Fox and Oak, about the old cannery, about the mirror in the truck with the angel-drunken glass. He thought about a sign out near the racetrack that had three bolts and one that had been replaced with a nail because somebody had been too tired to drive back to the shed, and how the nail made the sign vibrate wrong when the wind hit it. Names attach to small things. Vespur knew that. So did he. He had time now because he had bought it with other men\u2019s carrying and with lemon and with a quarter. Time is the dearest coin. You spend it best when you aren\u2019t trying to impress.\n\nMorning showed up wearing the shape of a church before the hour made people believe in it. St. Elm\u2019s smelled like wood oil and dust and lilies in a way that made even nonbelievers adjust their shoulders to fit the room. The pews had jars under them because of course they did, and they had to be addressed not with smashing but with teaching. Hearts remember. Wood does too. Tansy walked the aisle and did what she does, bells in her head making a map of the quiet. Her baby slept with his mouth open because that\u2019s how a body tells you it trusts a building. Aunt Lydie stood in the back and cracked the door and let the morning in to see what they were doing, heavy with humidity and news from the river. Merritt knelt and took a jar with both hands and said, \u201cNo,\u201d and then said, \u201cYes,\u201d and the difference made the air feel less like apology and more like invitation. Rosa had brought sprigs of something that used to be called balm and she tucked them at each end, and when old Miss Etta, who had sat in that church since she had had two good knees, came and saw them there she nodded like someone had put a blanket over a sleeping child.\n\nHe found it at the sign by the racetrack because he had known he would. The wind had a catch in it there, and the catch had a vowel tucked into it like a burr in a sock. He took a ladder because he was not a man for guitars in public but he believed in getting high safely. Lyle held it, because he liked to, and because he wanted to practice the stance of a man who keeps another from falling. He pried the nail out with the marlin opener because tools like doing work outside their job sometimes, and the nail came like a boy changing his mind. Under it, wrapped around the bolt that had been meant to be there, was the strand, small and taut, like the end of a seam in a shirt a man had tugged without thinking until it got into his palm. He unthreaded it, careful, apologizing to the sign with his mouth because men had hammered it wrong and signs hold grudges when their work is made less by sloth. He braided the bit into his hat band with the rest and felt the song in it settle, not finished\u2014a thing like this doesn\u2019t finish, it finds its right place\u2014but not looking around for a door to run through anymore.\n\nThat evening, when the light did that thing it did in Ocala where it pretends to be from somewhere else so you remember to pick it up and look, he walked down to the spring. He did not expect a pageant. He didn\u2019t get one. The woman under didn\u2019t rise; she is not a god. She sent a ripple up to meet his finger and that was enough. He told her the story he had promised before it went to the paper, before the men at the bar told it wrong and funnier and then half-right again. He told her about the iron cooling on the courthouse steps, about boys sober for an hour by accident because something heavy needed carrying, about a mayor who had signed a paper and kept his speech, about bells rung by a woman who hears them whether you believe or not. He told it without clever ending or moral posed up like a scarecrow. He let the words be work. The spring listened and it took the story into its water the way a mother takes a sweater into her lap and fixes the worn places while talking about a recipe.\n\n\u201cBetter,\u201d she said without making air vibrate, the yes of a door closing behind a guest who has come in on the right foot. \u201cYou owe me nothing but the same. When you make another one, you bring it. I will keep you if you keep me.\u201d\n\nHe walked home thinking about keeping, about boxes and hats and jars and how his father had kept nails sorted in coffee tins with labels that only he could decode because the labels were not on the tins but in the way he had put them on the shelf. He thought about Vespur with a coin singing against his breastbone and whether that song got into his dreams or if he\u2019d learned to sleep with noise so young it didn\u2019t register as anything but daylight. He thought about the babies born in this heat who will learn to wait until the storm is over to cry and who will be right. He put his hand on his door and the door remembered to open with hope instead of habit. He made coffee after supper because he wanted to be perverse and he drank it on the steps and the mosquitoes recognized his blood and left him alone because some days a man should be allowed to just drink and be. He whistled the tune with no words and no room for fear and this time it didn\u2019t shake at all.",

                              "content": "The first time the smell rolled over Ocala, it came in under the live oaks like fog that had learned to rot. It slipped past the white fences and the tall grass and came to crouch in the blue shade behind the barn at Bramble Creek Farm. The horses stomped and rattled their chains. The mare with the star on her forehead struck the door with a neat hoof, once, twice, as if to knock sense into the morning. You could taste it, that smell. It perched at the back of the tongue, swamp and curdled milk and turned earth, wrong in a way that cicadas fell silent for.\n\nMerritt Harker had his boots on the fence rail, chewing a cut of grass and watching the colt\u2019s left ear. The colt flicked it, uneasy. Merritt was uneasy, too, though he didn\u2019t show it. The air in Ocala had moods; he\u2019d grown up listening to the oak canopies gossip with the Spanish moss, listening to the springs talk over limestone in glassy syllables. He knew the plain tastes of thunder and the citrus-knife smell of summer lightning. This was none of those. This was a trespasser wearing a borrowed coat.\n\n\u201cCan you help her or can\u2019t you?\u201d asked Odelia Bramble, crossing her arms. She was round in the same way the earth is round, solid and expecting honest answers. \u201cShe ain\u2019t eaten. She keeps looking at a corner that ain\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nMerritt stood, spit his grass, and patted his pockets until he found the handkerchief he\u2019d tied knots in last night. It wasn\u2019t cotton, not really. It was horsehair and citrus peel and three threads tugged from his grandmother\u2019s prayer shawl when she wasn\u2019t looking back when he was nine. He\u2019d soaked the handkerchief in a jar of rain from the last storm that had cracked the sky and made the windows look inward.\n\n\u201cI can help,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not her that needs it. Something came through, took a seat behind her eyes. Showed her teeth.\u201d\n\nOdelia sucked her teeth. \u201cSomething like what?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething that eats stink and grows on it,\u201d Merritt said. He spoke to the horse, softer. \u201cEasy, star-girl. We\u2019re just going to wash your morning.\u201d\n\nMerritt had a way with things that didn\u2019t have enough words to defend themselves. He could put his hand on a fence-post and hear the rain talk in the grain. He could look at footprints and tell if they\u2019d been made by a liar. He had, as he once told a drunk at the Fox and Oak, \u201ca partcilar set of skills,\u201d and then stifled a laugh because he loved when words went a little crossways. He could pull curses like splinters and grind them under his heel. He could make a room remember who it belonged to. He could braid a ward into a whip and crack it across a dark doorway so fast a tragedy would forget to step through. He\u2019d done all right with those skills. Enough to keep the lights on in his rented place south of the old Silver Springs park, beneath a live oak that wore moss like a veil and seemed to lean down to listen whenever he spoke.\n\nHe tied one knot in the handkerchief under the mare\u2019s left eye, humming something old. Something his mother had hummed when she shelled peas, not because it was magic but because it remembered a tune that had no words and no room for fear. He blew across the knot and it loosened, unwinding into the air and making it shred. The smell there was layered: horse sweat, hay, metal, manure. And something else that tried to perch. He cut that elsewhere with the edge of his name. Names, if you knew how, could be filed down to blades thin enough to pass through air and leave only the thing that didn\u2019t belong, naked and blinking.\n\nThe mare calmed. Her ear went easy. Odelia watched the steam of breath that rose in the morning and didn\u2019t say a word until the mare nudged Merritt\u2019s shoulder like they were cousins who hadn\u2019t fought in a long time.\n\n\u201cYou do this for folks in Gainesville?\u201d she asked, still squinting at a corner that Merritt had put right.\n\n\u201cI do it for folks who ask,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd some who don\u2019t ask, if things get loud enough.\u201d He untied the handkerchief and retied it, different knots. He would deal with the smell when he had more to go on. For now: playlist to ease a horse. Old songs. The kind with clapping built in.\n\nHe took his pay in cash and in a jar of peaches that tasted like sunset had signed them by hand. He\u2019d learned long ago that taking pay only in bills made different kinds of debt stick to you; peaches weren\u2019t tracked by the same bookkeeper.\n\nOn his way out, Merritt paused. The smell, that rot you could taste, wasn\u2019t just lingering. It was repointing. He could feel it like a tight thread tugged between his ribs and the northwest corner of the farm, where a sinkhole had yawned open ten years back and Odelia had filled it with broken concrete, shells, and prayers.\n\n\u201cYou had anyone come up the road a few hours ago?\u201d he asked. \u201cTall fella, perhaps, hat held together with safety pins, walks like he\u2019s got one foot in a well? Smells like a closet you forgot.\u201d\n\nOdelia blinked. \u201cNot that I saw. But we been getting calls. Mason from up off 441 says his dogs won\u2019t go under the house. Deputy Lyle came by around dawn. Said folks near Juniper were complaining. Something wrong with the air.\u201d\n\nMerritt hummed under his breath. Not a song this time. A map. He tasted how the smell ran, pooling in low places, climbing the pines like a cold thought, raking its fingers along the white fences. It was coming from the direction of the springs. Not the tourist part with glass-bottom boats and wedding pictures, but the old side, where the limestone remembered an older river that had gone underground and was still learning to be dark.\n\nHe climbed into his truck. It had a new battery and an old soul. It had the kind of dashboard that could hold a handful of marbles through a sharp turn without dropping one. He\u2019d scratched sigils into the steering wheel with his thumbnail and then rubbed them smooth with orange oil until they looked like ordinary scratches. He didn\u2019t like to look like anything other than ordinary, at least at first glance. Ordinary got you in the door. After that you could do what was needed.\n\nWhen he turned onto the road and the oaks made their tunnel over him, he felt the town bend. There was a kind of groan that came out of Ocala when something old in it decided to wake up. Springs didn\u2019t like to be poked. The forest neither. Merritt rolled down the windows and let the air talk to him. It spoke in frogs and in crows and in the hush that happens when wild pigs are somewhere you can\u2019t see but that every root in the area knows about.\n\nHalf a mile down, he saw Tansy Leon on her porch, curling her hair with a spoon because she said irons made her think of scars. Tansy had a baby on her hip and an opinion in the other hand, most days. Today she had a phone and a frown. She flagged him down with the phone.\n\n\u201cMerritt. You got your bag?\u201d she asked. \u201cCause I call you when I hear dead bells. There were three at four a.m. I don\u2019t know who rung \u2019em, but I heard \u2019em. Also, don\u2019t shut your truck off. It won\u2019t start back. Merciful Lord, something stinks.\u201d\n\nHe kept the engine running. \u201cYou take my advice two days out of the month, and I never know which two. What bells?\u201d\n\n\u201cI said dead bells. Like when Momma\u2019s folks used to set a bell over a body in case it was only mostly gone and not all gone, and the wind would jingle it to keep God\u2019s attention from wandering. Don\u2019t look at me like that. I hear what I hear. I got ears like a hound that went to finishing school.\u201d\n\nMerritt nodded. He did not hear dead bells like Tansy did, but he believed her when she said the air had worn mourning clothes for a minute. \u201cYou seen anything off?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly that.\u201d Tansy pointed across the road, where a stain dark as tea was spreading under the ditch water. The ditch was full as always, little creek\u2019s worth of runoff that never fully receded no matter how much the city pretended it maintained the drains. The stain fought the sun. It wanted the shade. It wanted to not dry.\n\nMerritt knelt. He pulled his pocket knife and a strip of orange rind from the bag on the passenger seat and cut the rind into curls. He dropped one into the ditch. It floated, then shivered, then sank, as if something under it had tasted and decided it wasn\u2019t the meal it wanted but would eat it out of principle. The ditch burped. Tansy made a face.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell me that\u2019s normal,\u201d she said. The baby on her hip pawed at her shirt and then reached a chubby hand toward Merritt\u2019s curls of orange like he wanted to eat the scent.\n\n\u201cNormal is a coat,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cYou can turn it inside out and it\u2019s still a coat. This is not a coat.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou talk in riddles \u2018cause you think it makes you mysterious.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd because I know how to keep myself entertained.\u201d He stood and put the knife in his pocket. His fingers smelled like his grandmother\u2019s kitchen. His shoulders smelled like the ditch now, and he didn\u2019t like it.\n\nTansy wiped the baby\u2019s chin. \u201cI seen Deputy Lyle motor past just now. He had his windows up and his shoulders up. He said Mayor Dobbins wants you to come by if you get a chance because the old fountains at the square were bubbling something green. You got time for the mayor?\u201d\n\n\u201cI got time for the springs,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cIf Dobbins is on the way, he\u2019s on the way. If he\u2019s not, he can wait with his green bubbles and drink coffee until the world rights itself or doesn\u2019t. You go in, Tansy. Keep the baby high, if you know what I mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn my hip?\u201d She narrowed her eyes, then laughed, then shooed him with the spoon. \u201cGet on, go.\u201d\n\nHe drove toward the forest. He passed the sign for the taxidermist that had been there since his father was young and probably before. He passed a yard sale where someone had set out a line of mismatched chairs like they were expecting a wedding that only ghosts had RSVP\u2019d to. The smell followed, not just in the ditch but in the lay of the day. It made him think of drains. It made him think of damp cardboard and the sour behind a fridge when the seal goes. It made him think of a man he\u2019d once unseated from a soiled throne behind the old cannery\u2014warlock, yes, but more importantly a coward that had learned a trick he shouldn\u2019t have and refused to forget it. That man hadn\u2019t smelled, not like this. He\u2019d smelled like cheap gin and cheaper perfume and the nickel smell of guilt. This was worse.\n\nBy the time he reached the anonymous part of the forest where the road gave up being proper and turned into sand and spitting ruts, the smell was everywhere. He pulled off, turned off the engine despite Tansy\u2019s prophecy, and climbed out with his bag. The bag was country doctor old: leather scabbed where it had been taken into scrub too many times, strap replaced, clasp mended with a coin and a prayer and a little nail. Inside were the tools of his living: chalk in a tin, salt in a jar, thorn in a twist of flannel, a length of blue rope, a piece of mirror whose back had been scratched. A horseshoe nail, too, bent into a question mark. A silver quarter with a hole drilled and a red string through it. A book whose pages looked like Wyoming but smelled like wet wood.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t alone. The scrub-jays noticed him first, bright and rude. Then a hunter\u2019s orange hat slipped between palmettos and came back into view with Lyle\u2019s head under it.\n\n\u201cMayor says you should see this,\u201d Lyle said, not stepping out of the brush until Merritt made the sign that meant I\u2019m myself and not someone else wearing me. Lyle had learned, after that thing with the mimics, not to take even easy things as given.\n\n\u201cI think I already am seeing it,\u201d Merritt said, and pointed to the spring. It should have been white-blue, clear to the bottom, water rolling up as if the earth breathed and could not keep that breath in. It was blue, sure, but a bruised blue, and the rocks at the mouth were furred with a wet grey that moved when the sun moved. Worse: there was a slick on the water, as if someone had poured old soup into it, and it made a slow wheel turn where it shouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI went down to do a pull,\u201d Lyle said. \u201cJust a dip, you know, to say my hellos. The scooters and the trout were skittering. I ain\u2019t seen them skitter. Then the old woman under there\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one who sings and doesn\u2019t need air.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe told me to go. \u2018Go, boy,\u2019 she said, like she was my buelah. I went,\u201d Lyle said with a small shrug and a big seriousness. \u201cI figured you\u2019d know where to put your hands.\u201d\n\nMerritt put his hands in his pockets and let the springs talk to them. He listened to the limestone explain. He listened to the rush under the rush, the underground dark river that had learned to be white at the lip. There was something in the line, something that had been coaxed from beneath where they were and led to the light with a chain made of stink. That chain had links like injuries, and old ones at that.\n\n\u201cSomebody\u2019s calling up the under,\u201d Merritt said. His mouth felt dry. \u201cNot just a little, either. Enough to lace it into town. Enough to let it wear the air like a glove.\u201d\n\nLyle scratched his chin. \u201cThat\u2019s not a usual Tuesday.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Merritt bent. He unscrewed his jar of salt and flung a bright arc of it into the spring and watched the arcs fall. They hit the slick and did not dissolve. They made a shape, a two-handed shape, then that shape inverted itself in a way that said, Forgive me. He did not forgive.\n\n\u201cYou recognize it?\u201d Lyle asked, trying not to breathe. His breath came shallow through his mouth.\n\nMerritt did, but the recognizing made his tongue want to swear and his hands want to close into fists over nothing. The shape was a calling sign, unlicensed and wrong. Only two in the county would dare use it, because the last time someone had, he had woken in a creek downstream of his life and never found the bank again. Merritt had sworn a thing then. Merritt had gone to his mentor and said, Give me the thread, I\u2019ll track it. And he had tracked it. He had not found the hands.\n\n\u201cVespur Rankin,\u201d he said, careful to not say it to the water. He said it to the dirt, where he trusted the ants not to carry it to the wrong ears. \u201cOf all the deadbeat mages, he stinks most. Literally.\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard of him. He the one lives out by the old bottle dump, the one smells like skunk that read the Bible backward?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s him. He doesn\u2019t live anywhere that will have him long,\u201d Merritt said. He put the salt up and got out the blue rope. He wet the rope, breathed into it, and snapped it. It cracked, and the crack ran out over the spring and into the slick and made a small cut that wept clear. \u201cHe can hitch his shadow to a possum and sleep in a ditch. He can make a baby stop crying by reminding it how pain is expensive. He can do ten ugly things you can think of and ten you can\u2019t. But most of all he can hide in a place you don\u2019t want to put your hand in. He\u2019s good at that. He\u2019s proud of that. He should not be proud of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know him?\u201d Lyle watched the rope like it was a snake that might decide not to be a rope in a minute.\n\nMerritt tied a knot and put it in his pocket, let the knot eat at the slick and saw it win a small patch that gleamed like a clean plate. \u201cI was with someone who unmade what he thought he\u2019d made,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cHe isn\u2019t fond of me. I\u2019m less fond of him. This smell is his cologne. We need to expect him in town.\u201d\n\nLyle swore under his breath, the kind of swear that might velcro itself to a kid passing by if you weren\u2019t careful. \u201cThe mayor is going to not like this. He doesn\u2019t like to use your name in a meeting. He says it makes him sneeze.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe can sneeze,\u201d Merritt said, and turned toward the truck. \u201cI got to make a ring at home, and then I\u2019ll come by the square.\u201d\n\nLyle grabbed his sleeve. \u201cMerritt. Be careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI usually am.\u201d He lied because he didn\u2019t know how to be careful when Vespur was the topic. You\u2019re careful around fire. This was not fire. This was the other thing.\n\nThe truck started because he asked it nicely. He drove with the windows down in spite of the smell that was learning to love the cab. He drove past his house\u2014the live oak bending, the wind chimes made of old spoons, the bottle tree clinking like laughter\u2014and he would have driven past his drive, but something in the way the light fell on his windows made him pull in. Someone had been there. The lock on the side door looked right but had a new scratch. The dust on the sill had a little checkmark in it. There were footprints in the sugar sand by the steps. He bent and looked. Two sets: one that was his, one that was a flatter boot and pointed its toes in like an apology. The apology was sarcastic.\n\nHe wanted to kick the door in. He did not. He put his palm flat against it and reminded it whose it was. The door\u2019s grain shivered. It sighed. It unlatched. He stepped in and knew immediately: something had leaned on his walls. The house held heat like a breath under a quilt, but the heat here had a cavity in it where a cold thing had sat.\n\n\u201cVespur,\u201d he said, not in a prayer voice.\n\nThey always want you to say their names. He didn\u2019t say it again. He went room by room and saw his things, where he had left them. The book on the table with a chapter about rope trickery and how not to. The jar of pennies. The bowl with the starfish in it. The old dog collar with no dog anymore. None of it moved much. Except in the kitchen, where a drawer had been opened and shut, and in the back room where he kept the box that his mother had saved from her mother. The box had a seam. It had been opened and shut with a care that was almost insulting, as if to say, I could have been clumsy but chose not to, because cruelty is better when it is neat.\n\nHe put his hand on the box and felt the past warm under his skin. The box held the little name-threads of his family. He kept them there not because he wanted to use them; he kept them because you don\u2019t leave names around where a rat could learn the shape of them. Inside, neat as he had left them, were threads. Only one was missing, and that one was grey-blue, like Sunday morning church shirts, like the river at dusk. His father\u2019s name.\n\nMerritt\u2019s teeth clicked. He couldn\u2019t help it. A sound came out of him that sounded like a saw that had bit into a nail. That was Vespur\u2019s trick, then. Not a simple theft, but a smart one. With a name like that in his pocket, Vespur could walk into Merritt\u2019s circles, foot on the rug, and the house itself would decide to be a good host. He could set his stink down and it would not be thrown outside. He could stand in the square and make a story that sounded like Merritt\u2019s father telling you the bees are swarming and to bring the sheets and the pot. And people would believe. Not because they were fools. Names are coats. They carry the smell of their owner.\n\n\u201cDirty,\u201d Merritt said. He set the box down with very careful hands. He knew how to cuss without words: he changed three tiny things in four small corners of that room and the house got ready to make blood cost extra. He tried not to stumble on the thought of his father, of the smell of his shirt, of the way he had taught Merritt to tie knots and to untie them, too.\n\nHis phone buzzed in his pocket. Aunt Lydie. He answered. \u201cI know,\u201d he said, because she would be calling because her teeth had ached or the picture of her dead sister had turned its back in the frame.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I know,\u201d she said. Her voice was a rainbow of warnings. \u201cYou come to me now. You bring your hands and your hat. He\u2019s out. He\u2019s out and on your road.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing his tracks,\u201d Merritt said. He shut the drawer the way you shut a casket. \u201cHe took Dad\u2019s name.\u201d\n\nSilence, then a sound like a fist in a drawer. \u201cHe did not.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did.\u201d He watched the window. He could feel the shade outside rearrange itself, trying on different shapes. \u201cI\u2019ll come, but I have to swing by the square. The mayor\u2019s fountains are doing tricks.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou bring me a handful of that trick,\u201d Aunt Lydie said, and hung up because she did not believe in goodbye until after you were back and had had coffee.\n\nHe did not have to go to the square to know the trick had been there. He could smell that cheap theater even with the good old big smell of springs over it. But he went, because he understood that he had to be seen in the places Vespur wanted him to be seen, to draw out the further trick. The square was crowded the way a lawn is crowded before a storm\u2014people close, eyes skyward. Mayor Dobbins was red in the face and trying to pretend he wasn\u2019t and had never been embarrassed. He saw Merritt and did the thing he did where he looked at the space to the left of Merritt\u2019s ear.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s my man,\u201d Dobbins called, smiling with his mouth and not his eyes. \u201cYou see to it, now. Someone dropped a dye in the fountain, a child\u2019s prank, a college boy\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou smell that, Mayor?\u201d Merritt asked, moving around the fountain, hand low, looking. The green wasn\u2019t dye. He could see little hell seeds turning in it like burrs under a dog\u2019s skin. He made a small knot and flicked it into the water. It sank, burst, turned those seeds to paper. People clapped because people like to clap when something they could not do has been done, even a little. \u201cGot a prankster that\u2019s more than a boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not need your commentary,\u201d Dobbins said, which meant he felt powerless. \u201cYou need me to sign something? To authorize? Because if we have to close the square\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should close the square,\u201d Merritt said, and felt the next part happen. He didn\u2019t see Vespur, because Vespur was the kind to sit in a tree in the dark under a coat of mold and eat an orange with the mold still on it, and then lick his fingers. He felt Vespur\u2019s grin in the way the air leaned. He saw Deputy Lyle at the edge of the crowd flinch and reach instinctively toward the gun he wasn\u2019t going to use. He saw Tansy across the way move the baby so its nose was stuffed tight against her shirt because she trusted her body to do what it needed without being told. He saw Rosa Crutchfield, who ran the nursery by the highway, put her hand in her purse and pull out a little bag of salt she carried for luck and for eggs. She looked at him and nodded because she knew the shape of a day going bad and would put her shoulder to it if he needed.\n\nThen the voice rolled out. It was an old voice. Not Vespur\u2019s. It was older and worn in all the spots where laughter had sat and where yelling had cracked it. Merritt\u2019s father\u2019s voice, not exact but close enough that if you weren\u2019t looking for wrong you\u2019d lean into it.\n\n\u201cBoy,\u201d said the voice, and Merritt almost lifted his head. It came from the stone phone box by the courthouse where they had put a tourist map and a pamphlet about the springs. The box rattled. \u201cBoy, you get yourself home and bring the chain. I told you. You don\u2019t go to the square when the drains sing. You don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\nMerritt steadied. He put his hand on the fountain stone and let the cool go up his arm. Vespur wanted him to run. Vespur wanted to pick him up and put him down and watch him hop. Vespur loved a dance if the steps were all knives.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said, because people were looking at the phone box and then looking at him like maybe he\u2019d left a door open. \u201cDon\u2019t hear that without seeing the mouth.\u201d\n\nSomeone in the crowd said, \u201cIt\u2019s his daddy. It sounds like.\u201d Someone else put a hand to their own mouth as if to keep the words from coming out and getting used.\n\nThen the other part of the trick, the dirtier part. Merritt smelled smoke before he saw it. He pictured his house with the moss and the spoons and the bottle tree and it shivered inside his chest. There was smoke indexing into the sky from his side of town, thin and black and straight. Vespur was not lighting it big; he was trying to keep it neat. He was a neat liar. He was burning something that would make not a blaze but a point.\n\n\u201cMerritt,\u201d Lyle said at his shoulder, low. \u201cYou see?\u201d\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d Merritt said. He should run. Vespur wanted that. He should not. Vespur wanted that more.\n\nHe made an oval in the air with his forefinger and then broke it with his thumb. The turn loosened just enough of the crowd\u2019s staring that they breathed again and started to mill. Milling was safer than staring. He looked at Rosa and she gave him one hundred percent of her attention in the small way he had taught her for times when you didn\u2019t have time to fuss. \u201cGo to my house,\u201d he said, not moving his lips much. \u201cDon\u2019t go inside. Look like you\u2019re just admiring the moss. Tell me with your left hand what you see.\u201d\n\nRosa nodded like he had asked her if she\u2019d water his basil. She drifted off, a woman with no hurry, though her bones knew she should.\n\nDobbins caught Merritt by the elbow then, new-style gentry grip. \u201cI do not like you meddling, Mr. Harker. But if you do, do it quietly. Folks are jumpy.\u201d\n\n\u201cFolks are smart,\u201d Merritt said, pulling his arm back without being rude and without not being rude. He moved toward the courthouse steps so he could have his back to granite while he thought. The dirty trick had two blades: the father-voice and the smoke. A third blade was likely. He scanned faces. People liked to look like people when they were people, and things in them that weren\u2019t liked to pull at the corners of the mouth like a puppet\u2019s string. He watched. He saw nothing obvious.\n\nThen his phone buzzed in his pocket again and Rosa\u2019s name and three words: \u201cdoor open not yours.\u201d Something clicked in him. He saw the lock without looking at it. He saw his back room the way you remember your teeth. The door was open now. It had been closed when he left. He pushed air toward it and got back the feeling of something sitting on his bed. He smelled it: not only Vespur\u2019s rot but a softer stink, like old milk in a warm car, skin with fever, a wool blanket washed and never fully dried.\n\nHe went cold enough that the sun felt like a suggestion. Vespur had not just stolen and lit and waggled. Vespur had put a thing in Merritt\u2019s house. Vespur had made himself host and then invited sickness.\n\nLyle moved with him when he moved. \u201cYou better tell me if I need a warrant. I mean, I shouldn\u2019t need. Your place is your place, but if I come in\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t coming in,\u201d Merritt said, sliding in by the old truck without looking like he was running. \u201cIf I don\u2019t come back in two hours, go to Aunt Lydie\u2019s. She\u2019ll tell you what to do. Don\u2019t try to be the hero. That job\u2019s taken. No offense.\u201d\n\nLyle almost smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll be the deputy. I know how to do that.\u201d\n\nHe drove. He drove in that non-running way that kept his shoulders down and his eyes wide. He drove with his foot light and his hands steady and the urge in his belly to stomp and to break and to fling. He was good at not flinging when he had to be. It was one of the particular things he could do: swallow his own heat so he didn\u2019t set traps you couldn\u2019t spring without breaking your own ankle.\n\nWhen he turned down his road, the smoke was thinner than a promise. Rosa was on the grass, bent over a patch of oxalis like she had suddenly found it fascinating. She had her left hand on her right elbow. That meant one person, inside, left side. She wore her hair up and her face steady. She didn\u2019t look at him, which meant there was an eye in his windows and she wouldn\u2019t tip it.\n\nHe parked three houses down and walked back. The bottle tree chimed like a story about to end wrong because the wind knew the plot twist before the reader. On his porch were small marks in pig fat, one on each step, neat coins of it. He didn\u2019t step on them. They would slide his feet and make his face kiss wood. He stepped over. He reached down and smudged one with two fingers and smelled the gravewater in it. Good, he thought distantly, a traditional boy. Vespur liked the old mess because it looked like making. It looked like he\u2019d read something. It made him feel complete. He was always missing pieces.\n\nThe side door was open. He stood in the threshold and nearly gagged. The smell had changed. It had bloomed. It was not just rot now; it was hotel carpet that had never had enough sun, old shoes with no socks, onions fried and left out, the ghost of a hundred laundries. And under it, a human smell that he knew so well he almost dropped.\n\n\u201cDad?\u201d he said, because the voice had been used and the name had been stolen and Vespur had expected him to say it in a hurt way. It came out flat. It came out like a test. The thing on the bed moved.\n\nIt was a man\u2019s shape. Matter-of-fact, if you didn\u2019t look too close. If you looked close, the edging was wrong. The shrug of the shoulder was a costume\u2019s shrug. The hand had too many lines and not enough. The face was a smear of features that tried to be a face he knew and almost succeeded until the blink was backward. It smelled like a man who\u2019d been ill and kept trying to get better and never did.\n\n\u201cBoy,\u201d said the thing, and the voice was the voice that had made him hammer straight and pull his nails and check his knots. \u201cYou let me up. This bed\u2019s too soft. You brought something in the house. You track dirt like a mule.\u201d\n\n\u201cVespur,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cYou\u2019re in my house.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat I am,\u201d said another voice, the real one, from the kitchen doorway where the light made it look like moss had gotten up and grown a man. Vespur Rankin stepped out, full, and he was the smell. He carried a little bag that had probably held sugar once, and he had a grin like he\u2019d put on a jewel that had belonged to someone else in a town where people knew who had had what. He wore a coat with patches and the patches didn\u2019t match. He had eyes that were the color of pond water when the pond is too round and has had no wind. \u201cAnd you\u2019re out of luck.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would argue that,\u201d Merritt said. He did not take his eyes off the thing trying to be his father. \u201cYou took a name that was not yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou put it in a box like hams,\u201d Vespur said, as if explaining a law of nature. \u201cA name is a river. It runs or it goes sour. I saved it from going sour. Don\u2019t look at me like that. Besides, it was in the trees. It was low-hanging. I ain\u2019t a saint, Merritt. I\u2019m not even a good sinner. I do the work that needs doing in this county and nobody thanks me. They say, Vespur, you smell. Vespur, you take a bath. Vespur, we can\u2019t have you at the homecoming \u2018cause the children retched last time. You believe that? Children. They born in blood and cry at water and they cry at me? Why?\u201d He lifted his arms slightly and the smell lifted with them and made the room grow smaller. \u201cThat\u2019s politeness for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the children are wiser than their folks,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cI think the children should run the courts some days. What did you call up in my springs?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a thing,\u201d Vespur said, proud of the lie and proud of the truth tucked in it. \u201cI opened a little mouth. I said, Sing for us. Folks are bored, Merritt. They\u2019re tired of being made safe. Safety\u2019s a dull god. I brought the party. And I brought your daddy to spend time. You were never good at that.\u201d\n\nMerritt didn\u2019t look at the smear on his bed. He didn\u2019t look at the way his own hands were wanting to shake. He looked at the pig fat marks, the neatness of the trick: the stink to drive him, the voice to stab him, the smoke to split him. He looked at Vespur\u2019s little bag. He looked at the floor.\n\n\u201cYou want to take a swing,\u201d Vespur said, kindly. \u201cYou keep all that mean folded like shirts and now you want to wrinkle it. Go on. Swing. Be uncareful.\u201d\n\nMerritt didn\u2019t swing. He took one step to the left and one step to the right and then he did the small rude thing of taking a little, useless-seeming object\u2014a bottle opener in the shape of a marlin\u2014from the counter and flipping it so it spun on the table and tapped the table\u2019s four corners, ping, ping, ping, ping. The house breathed. It whispered. The thing on the bed flinched like paper near a flame.\n\n\u201cYou used my father to get in,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cThat\u2019ll cost you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI used a vowel on a string to knock on your door,\u201d Vespur said, bored with the moral shape of the conversation. \u201cAnd the door opened. That\u2019s physics. You can\u2019t be mad at physics.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou played a dirty trick,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cIt works here. In front of me. It won\u2019t work out there. You can\u2019t get this close to anyone else without them learning the smell. You can\u2019t wear this long. You can\u2019t usually even be on the same side of a room as yourself without your stomach going wrong. You\u2019re good at getting in, Vespur. You\u2019re terrible at staying.\u201d\n\nVespur smiled in a sad way, like Merritt had said a true thing and spoiled it by knowing he was right. \u201cI don\u2019t need to stay,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to break a few of your tools. I need to seed a little mess. And I need to get somewhere else by night so as to do the same. You\u2019re the one who always thinks you got to fix the whole state by supper. How\u2019s that working?\u201d\n\nHe lifted the little bag and shook it. The sound was like beads and pennies. Merritt recognized the clink. Not coins. Teeth. He smelled the grave in the pig fat again and knew. Vespur had brought dead names to fling like water. He had brought someone else\u2019s poor, gone words to push into Merritt\u2019s corners. That was the other blade. He was going to gum up the house. He was going to make it stutter.\n\nMerritt was going to stop him. That was how this worked. He took a breath and let his particular set of skills measure the room. He made the place know his back. He made it so Vespur\u2019s left foot was a little heavier than he thought it should be and would come down a fraction late. He made the thing on his bed itch where it could not scratch. He drew a circle with an orange peel in his pocket and it made the air taste like day. He reached for the bit of mirror in his bag and held it so it caught the kitchen doorway light and made two small knives of it. He did the work. He loved to do the work well.\n\nAnd then the dirty trick inside the dirty trick. Vespur stepped back, not forward. He snapped his fingers and his stink rose, cooking off like he had turned on a burner. The room grew into heat and then slickness, and the slickness was a sound, and the sound was a voice not his father\u2019s and not Vespur\u2019s. It was a little voice. It was the baby from Tansy\u2019s hip, keening, not from hunger but from fear. It cut the room like a wire. It made Merritt unmake his circle by accident. It made him move.\n\nHe knew the trick even as he did what the trick wanted\u2014because he was not a god, and the cry of a baby is the needle in any good man\u2019s wrist. He broke toward the door. Vespur laughed, a short bark that didn\u2019t care about elegance. \u201cRun,\u201d he said, satisfied.\n\nMerritt came out on the porch where the bottle tree had gone quiet because the air had put its fingers in its mouth to listen. Rosa wasn\u2019t there. She had done what she was supposed to; she had drifted, invisible. Across the road, under the oak in his neighbor\u2019s yard, a stroller sat. Empty. Spun a little by the suggestion of wind and by the suggestion of hands that weren\u2019t. The baby noise came from behind it. He saw the shape in the shade and moved faster than a man who didn\u2019t know how to catch a lie thrown at his head. He went to snatch the baby up and hand it back to a world that was behaving like a person bumping their shin. His feet hit pig fat. He went down hard. He had not seen Vespur\u2019s neat little coin on that step, down under the rail, because he had exited by the front and not the side. He\u2019d stepped over those ones. He had not accounted for the kindness of Vespur, who never used one trick when three would braid so pretty.\n\nHe hit with his shoulder and tasted pennies. He saw a shadow over him and rolled, but not fast enough, because his house had a moment of doubt about whose hand was more honest. He jammed his elbow into a board and it bit him and he had blood on his fingers and the smell wrapped his head like a wet rag.\n\nVespur stepped into the sun, smiling like a man who knows the song and can\u2019t help but sing. He held up the little bag and shook it again and the teeth laughed. The laugh put a rope around Merritt\u2019s breath and tugged.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the upper hand, boy,\u201d Vespur said, pleased to be neat. \u201cDirty hands, clean work. Don\u2019t get up too quick. You\u2019ll fall again.\u201d He tossed the bag. It hit the porch and broke and the names came out and went skittering along the boards, poor things. The baby\u2019s cry cut off like a switch. It hadn\u2019t been the baby. It had been a jar in his throat, shaken.\n\nMerritt struggled up on one knee. He felt his house decide. It decided too slow. It had to, with dead names sliding across its skin. He put his fingers against the porch to tell it a joke it liked, the one about the man whose pockets were full of soot, and the porch laughed and shook the coins of pig fat loose. They skittered off like snails. He could move now. He stood, and the world stood with him, though Vespur had got what he had come to get: a picture, printed in every neighbor\u2019s mind, of Merritt on his own porch with stink and with blood and with a man on his bed that looked like something he shouldn\u2019t let in. Vespur had set the day to his tune.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll unmake it,\u201d Merritt said calmly, though calm was a thing he was ironing with both hands. \u201cI\u2019ll take your teeth and make a wind chime that keeps you out of every door you ever liked.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll chase,\u201d Vespur said, and took his own advice. He didn\u2019t leave by the road. He slipped into the shade under the oak as if it had a trapdoor for him and dropped, or seemed to. The smell went with him like a cape and then it didn\u2019t, because he could fold it when he wanted and hide. He left the room and the day and the county laughing.\n\nRosa appeared then, arm out like she had caught a ghost by the sleeve and was making sure it didn\u2019t break anything on the way out. \u201cHe put whispers under your rugs,\u201d she said. \u201cI heard \u2018em. They said your name wrong like my granny did when she had the fever.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the rugs outside and beat them until they confess,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cYou ought to go to Lydie\u2019s. Tell her he took Dad\u2019s name. Tell her he put hands in my house made of teeth. Tell her he used Tansy\u2019s boy to pull me. It wasn\u2019t him, but she\u2019ll want to count arms anyway.\u201d\n\nRosa nodded, her mouth a straight line. \u201cYou going to go after him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was going to go after him yesterday,\u201d Merritt said. He went inside and picked up the marlin bottle opener from where it had spun across the table. He put it in his pocket so he\u2019d have something to hold that had done what he\u2019d asked of it. He looked at the bed and at the smear that was no father of his but a shape that said father like a preacher who had never had a child. He lifted his hand and the bed groaned and the shape slid off and hit the floor like laundry. He opened the back door and shoveled it out with the edge of his name. The yard took it. The oak bent down and sniffed and made a sound of disgust and then lifted back as if unwilling to get involved in a mess that would take more than a day.\n\nHe washed his hands. He washed his face. He reknotted his handkerchief. He put his bag on his shoulder and the house shifted in its heart so it could watch the door for him. He said, \u201cI\u2019ll come back,\u201d because he meant to.\n\nHe stepped onto the porch again and the heat had grown since morning. The air stacked in layers. Somewhere in the fanning green, a hawk called and a rabbit decided to be elsewhere. He could feel Vespur\u2019s direction like a bruise that tingles when rain\u2019s coming. Toward the bottle dump by the old tracks. Toward the sinkholes where kids went to be alone and sometimes were. Toward the forest\u2019s wrong.\n\nHe set out, knuckles still stinging, anger sharp as lemon in the mouth. He would not chase like a dog; he would track like a man. He would bring a rope that knew how to tie itself to a lie. He would take the stink and turn it out like a coat hung inside a door where the sun could get at it. He would not be careful; he would be precise. He could do that. It was what he was for.\n\nAcross the street, someone said his name in a small voice. He turned and Tansy stood there, baby on hip, sweat on her lip, eyes big as saucers she\u2019d forgotten to wash. \u201cYou get him,\u201d she said. \u201cYou get him neat.\u201d\n\nHe glanced toward the square where he knew Dobbins would be practicing a speech about public nuisance and private responsibility. He nodded to Tansy. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you back his stink in a jar and we\u2019ll take turns smelling it whenever we forget what not to be.\u201d\n\nShe snorted. \u201cI don\u2019t forget.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said, and walked.\n\nThe live oaks arched and clutched, like hands in prayer or hands in habit. The road went to sand and the sand to roots and the roots to damp. He moved in the green like he\u2019d been born to it, which he had. The heat leaned and the mosquitoes tried him and he flicked them off because he was ornery that way. He followed the smell because you can follow a smell even if you hate it, and he made a small promise to the part of him that was a boy with a honey sandwich and a stick that he\u2019d come back through here sorry and whole.\n\nBehind him, his house put its shoulders up and stared at the empty space where Vespur had stood and decided to be a better house. Ahead of him, somewhere, Vespur decided to be a bigger problem. And in between them, in the trees and in the old bones of the town, the trick writhed and found new places to stick, the way a burr will find the cuff of your jeans and then your sock and then your skin. Merritt stepped careful and then not careful and then careful again, breath steady, hands ready, words in his mouth like stones he could throw if need be. He did not pray. He whistled a little, under his breath, a tune that had no words and no room for fear. And if his voice shook once, the palmettos pretended not to hear.",

                              "content": "Chapter three started the way a fever breaks: slow, with a clarity that did not feel like kindness. The bottle dump lay off a sand spur that had once been a road and was now mostly a suggestion with kudzu over it, a place where green glass had been poured out like the sea had lost patience and decided to be shards. They said the dump had been started when Prohibition made a kind of archaeology out of empty, and then every era since had added its own strata: medicine blue, cola brown, a generation of pickle jars, jelly gems, beer bones. In the heat, the glass held the sun in little cages so it could let it go again at angles that made birds misjudge. The oaks leaned back from it, not out of fear but out of the respect you give a place that keeps its own counsel. Merritt stood at the edge and put his hand down on a bottle half-buried and felt the fizz memory of a man\u2019s laugh in 1948 and a woman\u2019s hand in 1973 and a boy\u2019s boot in 1991, the footprints of thirst.\n\nHe tasted Vespur in the shimmer. It was not subtle. Vespur had come here recently and often. His stink was lacquered in the air and rubbed into the sharp. He had set up a little congregation in the dump\u2019s bowl, where the glass was thickest and the ground had given a little, and he had arranged bottles not the way a raccoon would or a kid, but the way a man arranges an altar he doesn\u2019t believe in but hopes will work. Merritt looked down at the neatness of the circle, the arc of green and brown, the blue in a triangle like teeth. It would be pretty if it didn\u2019t hum wrong. The hum was low and made the sac behind the ear itch. He whistled a thread of no tune and the hum complicated itself, admitted it was a weave, not a note.\n\nHe dropped to a crouch and nudged a bottle with a stick he\u2019d picked up that had sap dried on it like honey snow. The bottle sang. It sang a single syllable and then withdrew it as if embarrassed. He nudged another, and that one sounded like the breath through a reed with a hole half-covered. Vespur had made a call, then. Not to people. To under. To the part of the county that isn\u2019t mapped but is, a little, in the cooling charts in old houses\u2019 closets, where the damp licks its lips and counts itself. Merritt did not like that idea. He pressed his hand flat against the ground and listened to the earth say, Someone is reminding me I have other mouths. The voice was reasonable; the earth hates a lie, but it can be made to be impolite to itself when a man insistent brings a gift it cannot classify fast enough to refuse.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch the blue,\u201d said a voice behind him, and he didn\u2019t startle because he had already heard the whisper of Aunt Lydie\u2019s skirts through palmetto and the way the sand did only two crunches, not three. \u201cBlue is for the doctor, and Vespur don\u2019t know which doctor he\u2019s speaking to. He\u2019ll call the wrong one and then write his own death certificate and sign your name to it.\u201d\n\nHe stood and turned and she was there, hair tied up in a scarf that had started life as a red handkerchief and had been washed so many times it had become a new color unnamed. Her eyes were bright as if she had cried and then denied it to the mirror until the mirror gave up. She had her bag too, which was bigger and made of canvas blown with years and children, and it clinked in a way that meant she had brought the kitchen. He loved her all of a sudden, without sentiment, just the kind of love you have for a person who can talk a storm down to a boundary and make it stay there until the children are in and the dog tied.\n\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d be at home making coffee,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t mean to make it sound like a plea but it came out that way because a part of him was nine and had scraped his knee and wanted to sit on her porch and tell the scrape about itself.\n\n\u201cI made coffee, and it tasted like a funeral,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want that? I don\u2019t. I poured it on the ants. They got opinions now. Don\u2019t step on them, please. You seen Vespur\u2019s choir?\u201d\n\nHe gestured with his chin. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to make something come up and sing. He put hums in a bowl and is asking the air to be the choir master. He took Dad\u2019s name.\u201d The last wasn\u2019t a sentence he enjoyed saying. It tasted desperate and he mistrusted desperation. It made you use your teeth when your hands would do.\n\nAunt Lydie\u2019s mouth hardened like she was clapping without making a sound. \u201cWe\u2019ll cut his fingers off one by one and give them back to him as proper nouns,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wants to wear the man like a coat, let him find out buttons cost. You got your quarter?\u201d\n\n\u201cI got it,\u201d he said, and showed it, the silver with the hole and the red string. It felt like it had a weight disproportionate to its size, like it had learned gravity in a different school and came home with stories. He was suddenly, stupidly glad he had not used it at the fountain for a bigger flash. He might need it now for the true work.\n\n\u201cYou suck it if I tell you,\u201d she said, and he nodded because he was past the age where you argue with the woman who taught you to take operations as they come. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t touch the blue. You touched the blue?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t touch the blue.\u201d He stepped down into the bowl with her, careful where his boots went and more careful where his attention went. Vespur would have left a flattery trap or two, a little sheen here, a bottle neck that made a nice mirror there, and you lean in and someone grabs you from under your own face. Merritt was susceptible to flattery in the way men who try not to be are. He liked to be useful. That\u2019s a soft spot same as any.\n\nThey circled. They moved bottles but not with their hands, with the handles of their tools, with old care. Aunt Lydie muttered promises to the dirt. The dirt, which is a pragmatic creature, agreed not to take their feet if they took three pieces and left four. Merritt whistled and the whistle was not a call this time but a question about scale, and the hum adjusted its weight toward his ear as if to oblige. The hum liked to be liked.\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s calling doesn\u2019t have a name people use,\u201d Aunt Lydie said. She spoke as if she were telling him how to get to the good gas station. Her tone took the barbs out of the topic. \u201cIt lives where wet holds smell like a preacher holds a boy\u2019s shoulder, tight but saying it\u2019s for love. It eats what goes wrong on its way to right. It isn\u2019t mean; it\u2019s tired. Tired turns mean if you shake it long enough. He\u2019s rattling its cage.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s good at that,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cHe\u2019s a stick on a fence. He\u2019s the boy who bangs the pot with the spoon and then looks like he invented percussion. Why here?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause here holds memory like a jar,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a glass mouth. He\u2019s playing it like a horn. He don\u2019t blow right, but he blows long. People think about trash and they think about empty. Trash isn\u2019t empty. It\u2019s full of try. Full of the last of an intent. Drink. Save. Sweet. Keep. He\u2019s using the kept and the sweet that went bad and he\u2019s telling the under to take heart because we up here got lazy.\u201d\n\nMerritt nodded because it did feel like a sermon being preached to an audience that had not consented. He had been in those churches. He set his bag down and took out the blue rope and cut a length with the knife and tied a knot so plain it was nothing but an honest knot. He wet it, breathed into it, and set it over the north of the circle. He placed the mirror bit south and angled it so it caught the sky and then refused it. He set the horseshoe nail east where it would remember the road and the quarter west where it would remember debt. He thought about his father, not the name but the man, and he put that thought into the way he touched the ground. He could feel the ground recognize it. The ground likes a man who can carry a bucket without slopping water on his own shoes.\n\n\u201cTell me something true,\u201d Aunt Lydie said suddenly. She was standing with one foot on a 7-Up bottle and one on a pickle jar, and her weight was perfect over both. \u201cSay it like you mean it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis ghost isn\u2019t in that thing that sat on my bed,\u201d Merritt said. He looked at her and the words had their own ease after he started. \u201cMy father isn\u2019t a smear of apology made into a man shape. He isn\u2019t a voice in a phone box. He isn\u2019t a coin of pig fat. He\u2019s the way to tie a truck bed so nothing falls out. He\u2019s the itch you get when you forgot a tool on the grass. He\u2019s the taste of a peach and the lesson that if you don\u2019t wipe your knife you don\u2019t get to use it twice. He\u2019s not that thing Vespur put there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d she said, and her eyes got wet like she had bitten into something sharp. \u201cSuck your quarter.\u201d\n\nHe put it to his mouth like a child a charm and sucked and tasted tin first because his mouth had learned wrong from cheap coins, and then he tasted not tin but a clean cold, a January in a well. The quarter had been made before they took the silver out and replaced it with something that lied. He closed his eyes. He saw a woman at a sink in a year when the radio hissed in the curtains. He saw a parade of soldiers he did not know. He saw a hand press a coin into a palm and say, Pay what you owe. He felt the quarter settle under his tongue like he had swallowed a small moon.\n\nThe hum did not like this. It wobbled. It tried to be a good hum and be friendly, then it remembered it had been arranged by a bad man and decided to get uppity. The bottles rattled a little and the blue ones actually hummed higher, thin and at the top of hearing. Aunt Lydie hissed through her teeth, a sharp sound that bit the air and made it step back. \u201cDon\u2019t you try to whistle me,\u201d she said to the hum, and it realized its mistake. She bent and rearranged two browns with the tip of a spoon she had pulled from her bag, and those browns dropped the center of the thing from grievous to grumpy.\n\nVespur did not appear. Vespur knew to let his work sit in other hands and soak them like onions. He had left a thing, and the thing did his leaning. Merritt felt for the thread of Dad\u2019s name and did not feel it there, which meant Vespur had carried the piece on him. That would complicate the work like a burr complicates a sock. He would get around it. He\u2019d been taught arounds.\n\n\u201cWhat we do is unstring his strings and not break the instrument,\u201d he said, mostly to convince the air. \u201cI could pitch a fit. I could smash and salt. The springs would like it for a minute and then hate me for a year. The under is on its belly and he\u2019s poking it with a fork. We can get the fork out. We can dull the tines.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can teach it to eat in the woods again instead of at our table,\u201d Aunt Lydie said, and her mouth went sideways because she liked her own metaphor. She took out a small cloth packet from her bag and handed it to him. Inside was a gray powder with spark in it. \u201cDust of clove and iron and the hard part of a bee, the stinger and the will right behind it. Put that on the green.\u201d\n\nHe did, careful, like he was salting a fish. The powder took the slick that lay like pride on the glass and gritted it down into something a worm could consider without dying of ambition. He felt the under shift, a long exhale, not ease but acquiescence. The spring woman moved in his mind like a fish turning, old bones smooth with water. She said, Thank you, and then, Be quick. He was heartened and not, because when a spirit that takes a century to have an opinion tells you to hurry, you hurry.\n\nHe took the blue rope, now dark with wet from his breath and the air, and snapped it again and laid it across the circle like a sentence ended the right way. He placed the nail at its head, the quarter at its tail, and the mirror in between so that any under that slid up would see its own wet face and be shy. The hum got confused. Confusion is a door. He opened it. He sang something his mother had hummed when she shelled peas and he had thought it was just a tune and now saw it was a path. Sister, sister, go slow, we will not spill, we will move the bowl as one. The bottles shivered and then went still. The blue did not chime. The green did not slick. The brown sat like good dug earth. It wasn\u2019t a finish. It was a pause that could be taught to be a stop.\n\nThey stood up together. They breathed. The glass in the heat clicked as if it were cooling even though the day climbed. Aunt Lydie wiped her face with her scarf and looked younger and older for it. \u201cThat\u2019s two stitches and a knot,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019ll cut one by supper, two by night. He has time. He ain\u2019t got sense about when to stop. He thinks if he runs enough no one will notice he\u2019s in one place always.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d Merritt asked. He scooped up his rope and his mirror and his other small truths. He hated leaving circles behind, even circles interrupted, but the day said move.\n\n\u201cBy the tracks where the kudzu ate a truck and you can still see the mirror if you go in deep,\u201d she said. \u201cHe made a cypress house in a place that doesn\u2019t like cypress. He\u2019s in love with the wrong trees like he\u2019s in love with the wrong saints. They tell him no and he hears yes. You ready to be mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready to be precise,\u201d he said. He tasted the quarter again in his mouth and it tasted like decision. \u201cMean gets on your hands. Precision cleans itself if you let it.\u201d\n\nThey cut through palmetto. Palmetto is not kind to legs but it is honest about its knives. The ground went wet underfoot where the land decided to remember, briefly, that it had been river once. Mosquitoes fussed and he flicked them with a little magic and some with his fingers because solutions should not all be elegant. They came on the tracks. They were not tracks anymore; they were a line with history. The kudzu had covered what it could and then shrugged over the rest like a blanket a cat had pulled and that would do. They went in, under, in a green shade that had weight and temperature. Merritt slowed because this was the kind of place that liked to count you before and after and complain if the numbers did not match.\n\nThe truck was there. It might had been a Ford in the 80s. It had lived, worked, blown a hose, and been left like a promise broken on a weekday. The kudzu had made it a shrine, hung with leaves, full of frogs. The mirror was indeed intact, and it held the green whole and made it meaner. Vespur had scratched sigils on it with a key or a penny in a way that made the mirror think about not reflecting the way it always had. Merritt looked without leaning and saw a shape in the seat that wanted to be a man and was a bundle of burlap with a shirt over it. He did not say hello to it. He didn\u2019t honor decoys.\n\n\u201cUp,\u201d Aunt Lydie said, chin. He followed her look. The cypress began where they should not, their ankles in not enough water, absurd and stubborn. Someone had lashed boards between three of them and call it a house. Mud had been smeared for insulation in a way that said, I\u2019m clever, and the mud had said, I am not your friend but I will ride with you until I have time to be. Tied under the house was a cage made of bicycle rims and coat hangers and in it something had curled that looked like a dog and a sack of rags and a wounded idea. It was asleep or pretending and it stank with a sweetness that made the teeth ache.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say its name,\u201d Aunt Lydie said. \u201cIt\u2019s not its name and it will wear it wrong. If it wakes, give it something to eat that isn\u2019t you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got oranges,\u201d he said. He did, in his bag, because he was not raised for hunger. He got one out and balanced it in his palm so it won\u2019t be an insult if he threw it. He looked up. The house let him know it knew he was there. He knew how to talk to houses but this one had been taught a mouth by Vespur and it was a mouth with extra teeth. He let Aunt Lydie speak. She can talk a building into telling you what it married and why.\n\n\u201cWho sits in you?\u201d she asked it, as if she had knocked and the house had answered and she could see the person through the screen and needed to make a decision. \u201cIs it him? Or did he go and leave his hat?\u201d\n\nThe house thought about lying and chose not to because lying takes more energy than people imagine and the boards had some sense left. It told them: he\u2019s inside and he\u2019s awake and he\u2019s proud because he arranged a wall with jars in it and the jars sing when the wind goes. He\u2019s in love with his own truth. He thinks his stink is a spice. He thinks we appreciate him for being consistent.\n\n\u201cDoes he have the thread?\u201d Merritt asked. He didn\u2019t say whose thread or what thread, because names were sensitive and the house would give all of it up if it knew what all of it was. He kept his ask small and the house could keep its answer safe. That\u2019s how we get along.\n\nIt said yes in creaks and a small falling of dust. Merritt nodded like he\u2019d expected that, which he had. He wrapped the orange peel around his finger and let oil pop into the air. The stink wavered a fraction, as if remembering the concept of pleasant. He took the horseshoe nail and put it in his mouth for a second and tasted rust and sorrel and the horse. He took it out and flicked it underhand and it lodged in the lash roping between boards as if it had been magnet and wood had been true north. He felt the rope remember being held by a hand that did not care if its palm blistered.\n\n\u201cYou want me to go,\u201d Aunt Lydie said in that way she had that meant she already wasn\u2019t. \u201cYou want to make it a straight line, you and him and the coins in the between. You want me to be the net if you fall.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you not to get bit,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t say he wanted his aunt to not see him if he had to do unclean, because she already had and still brought him grits. He wanted to keep the ledger tidy in her eyes even if the math went sideways elsewhere. \u201cYou be the bell. If you hear me say a word wrong, you ring so loud even the deer fall down and you wake the sky.\u201d\n\nShe fished a hand-sized bell out of her bag, iron and old, with a crack like a lost tooth. She kissed it and set it to her lips like a horn and didn\u2019t blow. \u201cYou go then,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd mind your elbows. He\u2019ll go for joints. He likes to make a man bend wrong so he can laugh.\u201d\n\nMerritt climbed. He put his boots where wood would bear and not scold, hands where nails weren\u2019t making a point. He could feel Vespur\u2019s attention the way you feel a stare through a window that\u2019s got a screen you can\u2019t see from the outside. He stopped at the sill and made the sign that meant I\u2019m polite and the sign that meant I will be rude if you make me. He was in, then.\n\nThe jars were what the house had said: a wall of them, big picklers and little jam-keepers, nailed and wired, cobalt and clear, a stained glass made by a drunk angel who had learned only half of color. In each, something wet. In some, just water that had been made to be not water by being put in. In others, rags. In one, hair. In one, candles stubbed and then drowned. A jar hummed when the wind went, and the wind did not go but the jar hummed, which meant Vespur had put something in them that did not require air to sing. The sound stroked the room.\n\n\u201cYou like my organ?\u201d Vespur asked, and he turned, smiling, from where he had been trimming a wick that didn\u2019t deserve it. He was cleaner than he had been at Merritt\u2019s house, because he had washed with something that had lemons in it and then refused to rinse. The cleanliness on him looked like mockery. He had tucked Merritt\u2019s father\u2019s thread in his breast pocket like a handkerchief, barely, intentionally visible. It made Merritt see red and also want to laugh at the pettiness because pettiness, done that neat, deserved either a crown or a kick. He chose the kick.\n\n\u201cYour organ is out of tune,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cAnd your hands are wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always think I\u2019m playing the wrong song,\u201d Vespur said, pleased that they could slip into the corridor of an old fight and pace it. \u201cYou\u2019d like it if I did scales. I don\u2019t practice. I perform.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerform for who?\u201d Merritt asked. He stepped in. He kept his shoulders relaxed and his knees awake. He noticed the floor had been powdered with a little ash and a little flour, so Vespur could read feet. He didn\u2019t let the floor read him; he read it. He put his weight in the way that says I could have been a dancer if I\u2019d wanted but I liked fixing tractors better.\n\n\u201cFor the lady under,\u201d Vespur said, with reverence that wasn\u2019t respect. \u201cShe wanted to sleep. I opened the shutters. You should be thanking me. People like you like to fuss when you got no work to do. The county was quiet. I gave you a reason. You look beautiful when you\u2019re trying.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look like you got fish in your pockets,\u201d Merritt said, and Vespur laughed. He had a beautiful laugh, everything wrong about him condensed into joy. It made Merritt nearly, almost sorry.\n\n\u201cYou came to take your daddy back,\u201d Vespur said, and tapped his pocket. He had the thread on a little safety pin like the kind that holds together last-minute bridesmaids. \u201cYou came to make a man act right. You came to say this house is a sin and make it come back as a porch. You ain\u2019t the only one knows how to talk to doors.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came to kick your organ,\u201d Merritt said, and then he did, not the way you kick a dog or a man but the way you kick a door you know is not load-bearing. He put his heel into a jar that hummed exact and needed not to. It broke with a sound like a conch being insulted and the hum upset. The other jars took it as a cue to panic, and panic made them louder because hummed panic is never quieter. He threw the orange. It hit a jar of hair and the hair soaked up the citrus and went limp with gratitude. He flicked his mirror piece and it cut a string that had been hidden in shadow and that string had been attached to a little bell and the bell rang once and the house woke all the way.\n\nVespur\u2019s face changed. It dropped its mask of conversation and showed temper, the simple kind, not a strategy. He loves being interrupted. He hates it, too. He came fast with his hand out flat and the stink on it made the air try to step back. Merritt put his forearm up and took the slap the way you take the wave from a boat you saw coming. It stung. It had coins in it. He let the pain be a marker, not a wall. He drove forward, not for Vespur, not yet, but for the jars.\n\nVespur grabbed for his pocket but Merritt had run a line in the floor quick with the blue rope and the rope tripped him the way a memory does when you laugh and then remember something sad. He went down sideways and barked his elbow and howled like a coyote and then grinned while he was howling, because he contained multitudes. He fumbled with the pin and pulled the thread and held it up by two fingers and in that second Merritt smelled his father\u2019s Saturday. He wanted to cry. He didn\u2019t. He went for the thread like a man going for a snake that has a ribbon in its mouth.\n\nThe bell below blew. Aunt Lydie had heard a word wrong because he had said a word wrong, because Vespur\u2019s hand had gone for his knee with two fingers and made the joint think it belonged to a different life. He staggered, said, \u201cNo,\u201d but not to what he meant. The iron cry went through him like a friend leaves a party, with hugging, and he woke his sense. He spat the taste of quarter into his mouth on purpose and the world steadied.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you be clever,\u201d he told Vespur, because clever still matters to men who think they are. \u201cGive me my father\u2019s coat.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks good on me,\u201d Vespur said, and it did not. He licked the thread and his tongue went numb and he shuddered and he smiled. The smile was a room without furniture. \u201cYou like to keep your dead tidy. I like them lively.\u201d\n\nMerritt went low instead of high. He took Vespur at the ankles not with his hands but with the weight of his name, the part of his name that was a wheel-barrel full of feed and an inclination to put shoulders into things. He yanked. Vespur\u2019s balance went. The thread went up, then down. Merritt snatched. He had it. For a second he had it and it burned like ice and sang like a kettle. He tucked it into his shirt where it could lay on his skin and know it was home, even if not all the way.\n\nVespur screamed not a word, not a noise, but he screamed, and all the jars broke together like a choir finding an agreement you don\u2019t want to hear. The dog-sack thing under the house woke and struggled, and the green outside leaned in, and the under heaved in its wet bed. Merritt grabbed Vespur by the coat not to hit him but to make him look at him. He said, \u201cStop,\u201d and he said it with the weight of the porch and the fence post and the hoof of the mare that had knocked the morning to sense. He put authority on it. He put ancestry. He put his mother washing her hands and drying them before she touched his hair. He put it all.\n\nVespur froze because authority still works if you say it right. He blinked. His eyes were pond and a boy under the pond. He smiled, small, like he remembered something from when he had been less wrong. He said, almost wonder, \u201cYou love that man.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d Merritt said. He did not let go. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to stop. You\u2019re going to go into the pig fat you love and wash in it and come out the other side a little cleaner.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr else?\u201d Vespur asked. He liked fights that could be theatrical. Merritt disappointed him by not making it grand.\n\n\u201cOr else I make you owe me,\u201d he said, and Vespur flinched because debt was something he did not believe in until someone else held the note. Merritt took the silver quarter out of his mouth and pressed it flat against Vespur\u2019s forehead and the coin stuck like a wet leaf and sizzled like bacon and Vespur tried to laugh and it came out a cough with prayer in it. \u201cPay me back,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cNot money. Days. You pay me days of quiet. You pay me springs clear. You pay me a town that can sleep. Or else that debt pulls your joints apart on a Sabbath and lets you think about your choices.\u201d\n\nVespur moved his mouth. He wanted to spit. He wanted to say a charm that would fly like a mosquito and get in Merritt\u2019s ear. He wanted to wriggle. He was a wanting man. He nodded. He couldn\u2019t help it. The quarter made the nod like gravity made falling. He whispered a yes and tried to make it sound like a no. The house bucked. The jars were gone. The rope snapped back and bit Merritt\u2019s calf and reminded him he was, in fact, constructible.\n\nAunt Lydie\u2019s bell blew again, not an alarm this time but a cadence, an end. The dog-sack under went back to its nap with a bad breath snore. The cypress shuddered like women who\u2019d laughed too much at a wake. The hum fell out of the air like dust out of a shaken rug. Merritt did not trust the peace. It was too neat. It was Vespur\u2019s kind of peace, curated and timed. He took the thread from his shirt and could taste, in his own teeth, that it was not all of it. It was enough to bring the house to itself. It was not enough to bring his father\u2019s coat back to warmth. Vespur saw the knowledge in his face and smiled like a boy who had eaten only half the pie on the window and thought that meant he had been generous.\n\n\u201cYou like to think you finish,\u201d Vespur said. \u201cLook at you, in the middle. Look how you glow.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out of this house,\u201d Merritt said, because he had to complete the spell he had started, and the house wanted him to complete it. \u201cDon\u2019t put hands on it again. Don\u2019t put your breath in the jars. Don\u2019t lay your head here even by mistake. It will not rock you.\u201d\n\nVespur took his coat and his bag and a handful of insults and slid out past him with a courtesy that was almost saintly. He paused by the door and looked back. There was a hope in his face, small, like a lantern kept in a closet. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you have fun,\u201d he said, and then he was down and into green and gone. He left behind less smell than Merritt expected. He had learned to fold some of it away. He had left other things, though, small wrongs that would be found by fingers in the night and needed mending. He was going to be more work than men ought to be to each other.\n\nMerritt waited. He did not fall or sit or gloat. He stood and let his shoulders come down and he listened to the under, and the under said, I can breathe for a minute, and the spring woman said, I will be at the place you found me tonight and I will ask you a thing, and Aunt Lydie\u2019s bell went quiet because she had put it down and was watching dragonflies fix the light. He tucked the thread deep, not in the box in his house where a rat might write poetry with it, but in the place between his ribs where the sternum protects singers. He would get the rest. He would need a better knife or a softer hand. He would talk to the woman under the water. He would talk to his father not by name but by work, which is the way that man liked to talk anyway.\n\n\u201cWe got to go,\u201d he called down to his aunt, and she called back, \u201cWe do,\u201d and her voice had coffee in it now, which meant she had forgiven the day a little for being itself. They moved back through green, not triumphant, not defeated, in that after of a fight where your cheek starts to swell and you don\u2019t tell the other person what you intend to put on it for the bruise.\n\nWhen they reached the edge of the dump again the light had changed in the way that makes shadows show their bones. The bottles didn\u2019t hum. Some of them had hairline fractures that made them dangerous to touch and prettier. Merritt thought about gathering them up and then thought about the way glass wants to go home to sand and left them. He picked one, cobalt, the size of a child\u2019s fist, uncracked. He put it in his bag. A trophy, not for him, for the house, so it could have something blue that wasn\u2019t a note.\n\nOn the way to the truck they met a man with a cooler, coming the other way, face red and eyes narrow, and he nodded to them like you nod to neighbors at the boundary of where you think the law begins. He said, \u201cHeard it stinks up yonder,\u201d and Merritt said, \u201cNot anymore,\u201d and the man said, \u201cGood,\u201d and they all pretended that meant the same thing. Merritt put his hand on the hood of his truck and it purred at him accusatory because he had turned it off earlier when Tansy told him not to, and he told it a joke and it forgave him and started.\n\nBack at his road the smoke had forgotten its own ambition and turned into a story people would tell that evening over sinks while they washed plates. His porch had a tooth or two still rolling, patient as dice. He swept them into a jar and put the jar under the sink because he didn\u2019t yet know whether to bury them or cook them or melt them. He walked through his house and it exhaled him back like bread ready to be taken from the oven. He touched the box and said, \u201cNot yet,\u201d and it sat still and watched him with the patience of cedar.\n\nHe went to the sink and washed his hands again, not because they were dirty but because he needed a minute where his hands did something plain before they did something hard again. The phone skittered where it lay and he picked it up. Lyle had left a message in the voice of a man who wants to be calm the way a dog wants to be a cat. \u201cFountain\u2019s quiet,\u201d Lyle said. \u201cMayor says he did that. I told him he ought get a ribbon if that\u2019s true. Also, Mason\u2019s dogs are still weird. Also, Juniper is mad at you for reasons. Also, you coming to the square tonight? Band\u2019s playing. Might be quiet enough that you can hear them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to the springs,\u201d Merritt said to the sink and the sink said, Yes. He dried his hands. He took the marlin opener out of his pocket and set it in a place of honor\u2014a nail on the wall where it could see the door\u2014and it caught the light and looked like work.\n\nHe poured coffee, and it did not taste like a funeral because Aunt Lydie had put something by the pot earlier, a leaf that told the brew to be brave, and he had not noticed. He drank and thought of his father and did not hurt as much for a second, and then hurt more. He put his hat on and the day opened for him like a book with a cracked spine that still had a story he loved inside.\n\nOn the way out he paused on the porch and looked at the bottle tree. It had a new sound in it, a low note, and he realized Rosa must have tucked something there while he was in the green. He looked and saw a square of cloth tied to the end of a branch, printed with lemons. He laughed, a small sound, and the tree laughed back. He stepped down careful and the pig fat was gone, dispersed or ashamed, and when he stepped into the yard the grass stood up like a dog deciding to live again.\n\nThe springs would be cold. They would be honest. The woman under would have requests. Vespur would be somewhere, making himself a religion out of stain. Merritt would need better words, older words, to put the under back in its bed and tuck it so it did not suffocate. He walked and the live oaks did their arch, and he whistled the song with no words and no room for fear, and this time his voice did not shake.",

                              "content": "Chapter five began with the kind of light that looks like it has to be held up by two hands. The day had gone down the long steps into evening and left the last of itself at the springs, pooling pale on the limestone the way milk skins over when you forget it on the stove. The park was closed with that particular finality that comes when a place that has entertained all day insists on remembering its own bones. The glass-bottom boats, fat as old ladies in church hats, moored and lulled themselves against their tethers, each window looking down like an eye too tired to keep watching. Merritt slid past the chain that meant keep out and the sign that meant liability and walked the boardwalk with the soft arrogance of someone who had paid more than admission in his lifetime.\n\nThe water was blue with night and blue with itself. It had none of the green slime that had ridden it like a dare that afternoon. The slick had been shorn from its back by rope and bell and powder, and the spring lay like a throat that had been cleared. The boil in the middle made its slow, dense roil, a heartbeat of aquifer. Merritt leaned on the rail and set his bag just so and breathed the cold that comes up even in Florida when earth remembers that not everything is sweaty. In the trees, cicadas had picked up the song they\u2019d dropped earlier, but they were cautious, each phrase like a hand put into a dark drawer before the light switch is found.\n\nHe put a peeled wedge of orange on the rail to sweeten his own temper and to see if the night wanted to borrow any of it, and then he took the quarter on its red string and held it over the water where it could smell its own ore in the limestone. The woman rose without fuss. She never came up in drama; she wasn\u2019t a god. She was a function that had personality, which is to say she was the part of the land that had learned to like you if you liked it back. She looked like somebody\u2019s aunt who did not have children but had sprouted patience anyway, hair gone gray in a heavy sheet that did not actually move, face full as river stones, eyes like the blue only springs hold. She carried no light and made a kind all the same, the kind you can read your hands by and not be judged for what they have done.\n\n\u201cYou made me say be quick,\u201d Merritt said, low and without preamble. The boardwalk under his arms listened. \u201cI\u2019m here. Say your ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou put powder on a hurt,\u201d she said, voice through the water, not at a distance from it. It came up like a current and went down like truth. \u201cYou did not name the one who cut the hurt, not to me. I like you better for that. Names make things decide to be worse, sometimes. I have a request. It is not small, but it is not unpayable. Will you take it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will listen,\u201d he answered, because he had been raised by people who knew that agreeing to a thing you hadn\u2019t heard yet was a way to wake in a field without your shirt. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong that isn\u2019t the immediate wrong?\u201d\n\nShe turned, not her head but the water, and in the turning he saw down the throat of the spring, down the channeled, limed chute into the darker river where light was only accounting. He saw, for the blink it takes to know what you\u2019re looking at, a row of posts that had not been posts when they were made, a line carved in limestone with iron, and the iron had rusted and stayed. He saw something that moved like a slick and something that did not move because bones are stubborn. He thought of chains and then dismissed it because this was not about people, not yet, and then had to un-dismiss it because everything here was about people finally.\n\n\u201cYou keep me for leisure,\u201d she said, not angry, archived. \u201cAnd worse, for seeing through. Eyes. Windows. People have put glass over me for a hundred years and called it kindness. Before that, men in lines cut the bottom so other men could sit with their feet in cold and say they were refreshed. Before that, a woman came with a child and put the child in and asked me to take fever, and I did, and the child grew, and the woman brought me a jar of pear preserves and sat where the board is now and told me about her mother. The iron stays. The smell stays. The story stays. The child grew and died still; not immediately, but eventually. I am not a god,\u201d she said again, as if reminding herself. \u201cThe under is breathing through my mouth wrong. The wrongness is old and has stripes like a raccoon tail and some of the stripes are men\u2019s and some are mine. I want you to pull up a thing that isn\u2019t yours and carry it to a place where it will be more at home. I will ask for one other thing after, and you will decide, and I will not be mean if you say no.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in the under,\u201d he said, tasting limestone in the back of his tongue even before he stepped off. \u201cNot that way. I went in through dreams when I was a boy and came out in Aunt Lydie\u2019s tub with the dog barking at me like I had been reborn wrong. You want me to hold my breath and trust rope?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to hold your breath and trust my mouth,\u201d she said, which should have been frightening but felt like a promise. \u201cHe shook me like a carpet. You stopped that. He pushed anger in with stink. You made the stink be work. This next is bigger because it\u2019s smaller. It\u2019s not one man\u2019s mean. It\u2019s a stuck thing. Will you unstick?\u201d\n\nHe untied his boots and set them side by side like men standing for a photograph. He wound his name tight behind his teeth so it wouldn\u2019t leak and invited only the parts of it that had use underwater\u2014Patience, Weight that knows where to go, Hands that can find a knot by feel\u2014to come along. He took out the blue rope and tied it around his middle and tied the other end to the rail in a knot that could be undone from beneath with a thought and that could not be undone from above by anything but teeth. He put the coin in his mouth and let it sit like a polite threat on his tongue. He took the orange wedge and bit it and let the sweetness push over fear. He looked like a man about to swim and he was, but the swimming he was about to do had nothing to do with lungs.\n\n\u201cLyle will come looking if I don\u2019t wave him off,\u201d he said, because saying practical things keeps you in your own pockets. \u201cIf he shows, tell him to count to two hundred by tens and if I\u2019m not back by then he can throw a fit. He likes doing that. It\u2019ll suit him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will rattle his badge,\u201d the woman said, and her mouth did a movement that wasn\u2019t laughter and was. \u201cGo down and put your hands on the old iron. Pull it up slow. There are names knotted on it like wet socks. Don\u2019t read them. Bring the iron up and set it on the deck and let the air argue with it. I will handle the rest.\u201d\n\nHe eased himself into the water and the shock of it hit him clean as a slap from a cheap aunt and better meant. He let that first cold be a wake and the second be a lesson and then there was no third because he was down and the spring\u2019s hand was on his chest and his legs did not kick because the boil did it for them. The water refused him panic by giving him too much information all at once; tiny air bubbles grazed him like he\u2019d laid down in a field of mice and they\u2019d all been polite; fish flashed close and then away with the offended speed of deer; his fingers found the rock edges that were as smooth as old opinions and then the crack where the cut had been made and then the iron, not a bar but a grate, slatted, spiked, forced in the age when muscle did this work with ... with what? He didn\u2019t finish that thought because breath is counting and distraction is debt.\n\nHe put his hand under the iron and felt the silt accumulated, not heavy because water disciplines weight, but stubborn. He put his other hand on the edge, where a little lip had been left by somebody who even back then had thought, We may need to get this out one day, and he blessed that someone and did not name him. The names slithered around his fingers like eels that wanted to be cats and he did not let them be. He went still and asked the iron to remember being ore. Ore loves to move. Man taught it to be still and useful. It remembered wanting, and he put his back into it and lifted.\n\nThe grate resisted with old politeness. He felt the rope around his waist go taut as the spring and he did not pull at it. He made the iron decide. He thought of fence posts and of beds unsprung and of the way his father used to say, Don\u2019t pry, boy, encourage. The iron encouraged. It came nudging up and then one corner freed and something below blew a long sigh like a mule turned back onto the field after church. He felt the current adjust, not angry, new. He had room to get a grip that would not scrape his knuckles bloody against rock and he used it and the iron granted him that it would leave.\n\nWhen it broke the surface it did it without fanfare, which is how big things should do it. He hauled the grate onto the deck. It clanged with a sound like all the old friends of iron showing up at once and saying, Well look what the river dragged in. Water sheeted off and ran between the slats and made first the boardwalk then the dirt underneath remember the shape of the bars. The names on it lay quiet, not wanting air. The smell that came up was not rot powder; it was something not relieved to be seen and also not willing to hide. It was the smell of a wound you kept clean without it ever closing because closing would mean it hadn\u2019t been necessary. Merritt sat down hard because the world tilted the way world does when it has to make room for a thing that had been there all along.\n\nThe woman\u2019s head broke again and the batch of her hair made a soft slap on the water. She looked at the grate without blinking because blinking is for eyeballs and hers were opinion. \u201cIt is not all of it,\u201d she said, and by that he understood that under there the line of iron continued, farther than his arms, into the throat and beyond, rusted into the lip of the under and some part of it had never been intended to come out. \u201cIt is enough for the river to stop apologizing for a choice it did not make. Thank you. I would take the names from you now, and dissolve them in a place that does not echo.\u201d\n\nMerritt did not touch the knots. He sat with water cooling on his shirt and the quarter in his mouth fighting with the taste of spring and orange and something that had not deserved its keeping. He reached down with two fingers and slid the knots into a jar he had brought for bait once upon a time and never used for bait because he had never liked tricking fish into thinking their day was going to be interesting. The jar took the names like they were dumplings. He put the lid on and tightened it and the jar made a sound like it was glad to work. He handed it over the rail to her and she took it with both hands like it was hot. She sank with it like a mother with a baby into a cold bath. He could have sworn he heard a ding, small and regular, further in, as if someone had hung a bell in the throat and left it and the tide rung it when nothing else remembered to.\n\n\u201cYou said you\u2019d ask for another thing,\u201d he said when the water calmed and the night leaned down to eavesdrop again. He had no towel and he didn\u2019t want one. He liked the clean chill. It made him honest. It made the story of who he was be easy to tell to himself.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d said the springs, and in that moment the woman\u2019s mouth was not just the lake\u2019s but all the mouths in the county where water had decided to look up. \u201cSomeone part of you is in a place that does not hold people well. You know this. You want him very much to be where he belongs. If I give you the route to the rest of that thread you put in your shirt, if I show you the hand that holds it and the teeth that hold that hand, you will owe me something that isn\u2019t work. Work you have done. Work you will do. I want something that is my favorite to want. I want a story that has not been told yet.\u201d\n\nHe laughed, a little, before he could stop himself. The cold made it tinny in his own ears. He thought of all the stories men had told in Ocala and laid heavy on the breathing door of the water and pretended were gifts. \u201cYou want what?\u201d he asked, though he had heard.\n\n\u201cA story,\u201d she said again, and was patient with him without being condescending. \u201cA new one. Not clever. Not the trick you tell at a bar to see if men think you are more than you are. A true story that has not happened. You give it to me before it happens. You promise it. You carry it until it does happen. And while you carry it, the under will be kinder to you. When it happens we will both have it to put on our shelves. If it does not happen, you may never drink here again without coughing. Do you accept this debt?\u201d\n\nHe sat back and considered bargaining. He considered offering days of quiet that he had already gotten from Vespur in a way that had to be repaid in a turn of the wheel. He considered offering the blue rope, the coin, his mother\u2019s hummed tune, the marlin opener, all of which were real and wouldn\u2019t satisfy. He thought of Aunt Lydie\u2019s bell and the way it broke his mouth when it went through him and knew that the price here was a different instrument. He leaned forward and put his hands on the rail as if it were a pulpit and he was full of sense and said, \u201cAll right. I will bring you a story that isn\u2019t made. I will make it by doing it. I don\u2019t know which one yet, but it\u2019ll be a story that improves the air.\u201d\n\nThe water smiled without water being able to. \u201cIt is a pleasure dealing with you. He is in the cold part under the bottle dump where men made pits and the rained-on days forgot to evaporate. He tied your father\u2019s piece to a story about money and left it in a jar with a worm and a promise to come back for it when the worm grew. He forgot worms don\u2019t grow that way. He will not remember until you have put your hand on it. There is a snapping turtle there who thinks he owns the jar. He will discuss rent with you in the old tongue. Do not flatter him.\u201d\n\nMerritt stood and re-tied his boots and the leather took his wet without comment like a friend who will show up to drive you without needing to know why. He felt his shirt cling and thought of childhood nights when he had come home from the sinkhole with a cussedness he applied to everything and his father had handed him a towel without a sermon. He tucked the penny taste away, the quarter hung against his teeth like a flag in no wind, and he chuckled at himself because he\u2019d started calling the silver a penny in his head and that meant his mind was tired. He nodded to the boat with its eyes and to the spring with her mouth and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be back with something you\u2019ll like. If you start to cough when I\u2019m done I\u2019ll know I failed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will not fail,\u201d she told him, not because she believed in him in a greeting-card way but because she had measured the shape of him and knew what weight he could carry without throwing his back. \u201cYou will get distracted. Everyone does. The smell is for that. The smell is an invitation to tell yourself the wrong story.\u201d\n\nOn the way back to the truck he saw Lyle coming with a flashlight, shoulders up like a man getting ready to suggest something tender to a skittish horse. He waved, big, exaggerated, and Lyle dropped his light beam low and took his hat off because there are places you do that even if nobody will see you but the raccoons. Lyle looked at Merritt\u2019s wet shirt and the rusty stripe on the boardwalk and the iron lying like a prehistoric fish and he exhaled like a man who had held his breath without meaning to.\n\n\u201cI was going to count,\u201d he said, halfway embarrassed. \u201cI lost track at six because somebody in the trees coughed and I was composing a ticket in my head for coughing in a public space.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can write it,\u201d Merritt said, smiling despite himself. \u201cI\u2019ll sign it. Flood the jail with coughers. We got a chart to work on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you bring up?\u201d Lyle asked, and then he answered himself because he had eyes. \u201cSomething that made us wrong before we had the new wrong. You\u2019re going to tell me a story about that in a minute, and I\u2019m going to misunderstand it and then correct myself in the retelling and get it right on the third try.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going back under by the dump,\u201d Merritt said, and watched Lyle wince because the dump was the kind of place a deputy keeps tabs on even in his sleep. \u201cIf I don\u2019t come back by\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t play that,\u201d Lyle said, sharp because he was tired of the practice men make of dramatic timing. \u201cCome back. I\u2019ll get coffee to the old place and tell Aunt Lydie you said to go ahead and have pie without you if she has pie. And, Merritt, if you need a ladder of hands, you call. We\u2019ll stand on each other. I got boys.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Merritt said, and did. He clapped Lyle on the arm without crushing his good intentions and walked into the night that had finally decided to be honest and dark.\n\nAt the dump the glass held stars with the same greed it had held sun. It took the sky privatized and made it shine in small squares so a man could pick one up like candy and be fooled. The insects had settled on a key that made your bones feel like strings. The road in was a hush that knew its own cars. Merritt parked three trees back and walked the rest, and because he had agreed to bring a story that had not yet happened he felt the edge of his choices change. He could feel the future like a fabric he might cut. He felt careful in a new way, not of falling, but of stepping on a pattern that could be prettier if he moved his foot two inches left.\n\nHe found the pit by the smell first, the old wet, not swamp and not ditch, but cellar that had been cut you-shouldn\u2019t, with water in it that remembered bottles and men\u2019s hands and a summer someone had broken into with a car radio and left a silver song for the frogs to listen to. He went down past a slick of labels that had outlived their words and past a tire somebody had made into a planter for nothing and stopped where the kudzu had failed to perform and left dirt bare in a confession. The hole was black like a pupil and the air above it had a cool that wasn\u2019t generous. He unwound his rope again and this time he tied it to a pine root that had the shoulders for it and he made a test knot low that said if a fool grabbed this it\u2019d hold and he chuckled because he was renewing his ambition to be precisely rude.\n\nThe snapping turtle was there like the spring had promised, an old beast with algae rubbed permanent into his back and eyes that were cruel by design and not intent. Merritt said hello to him in the old way that men used to say hello to monsters they intended to feed and not worship. The turtle lifted his head and set his beak toward Merritt\u2019s shin as if to say come on then, pay rent.\n\n\u201cI got orange peel and pig fat,\u201d Merritt said, because honesty was sometimes the quickest way through. \u201cI am not offering the second to you, because I\u2019m mad at it and I don\u2019t feed my temper. I am offering the first because you will like it, and if you don\u2019t, you will enjoy the novelty of not liking it.\u201d\n\nThe turtle, who in his long life had been fed everything from hot dogs to an engagement ring a girl had hurled and then regretted, accepted the peel and chewed it in a way that made the world feel briefly like a comedy about manners. He looked at Merritt with his old eye and decided for reasons that had nothing to do with human arrangements to move one foot to the left. In the black below, something turned. Merritt went down.\n\nThe hole had edges ridged with crushed glass cemented by time into a new comet. His palms learned those edges and avoided the obvious slashes because this was not the day for blood offerings. The water at the bottom was a plate in a cupboard you forget you have; when you use it, you remember why you bought it. It held cold. It held a single, silly minnow going in a circle like a man who\u2019d been given bad directions his whole life. Merritt put his hand in and the cold hit him in the wrist and wrote in his bones. He hunted by touch because light was an opinion here and one he couldn\u2019t afford to argue with. He found the jar lying on its side in the corner where men who throw have bad aim and gravity is mean. He found its lid, rusted on not completely, gummed with strip. He found the thread nicked in the seal the way someone might tuck a hair under a plate to see if their husband had eaten, old trick wrongfully applied.\n\nHe unscrewed the lid by asking it to trust the grip he had taught it and it did with a little complaining squeal. The worm inside had long ago done what worms do when kept in a jar by ambitious boys who are late and forgetful; it had changed from intention to stain. The thread lay like a vein. He slipped it between two fingers and it shivered with such relief he had to steady them both. He did not smile because that would pull this moment the wrong way. He just stole it back the way you steal a child\u2019s hand in a parking lot and say it\u2019s time to go and the child argues without teeth.\n\nWhen he turned his head to climb the turtle put its face close to his ear and breathed in a way that suggested jealousy and reprieve. Merritt took the hint and leaned his cheek to the old beast and said in the language of scrapes and baths and stories told on porches, Thank you. He did not flatter. He did not name. The turtle thought, if turtles think in words, that this was an acceptable human. He moved his other foot. He considered biting and changed his mind, which is a bigger act of civilization than we give it credit for.\n\nAbove him, the world made a sound like someone rolling dice in a coffee can and that meant the glass was remembering it could move. He didn\u2019t hurry, because one does not when one has hold of breath and thread and dignity. He climbed out and the stars shifted in the bottles as his head passed and for an instant the sky seemed to be a jar and he laughed because he had promised a story and the story had decided to look back at him as if to ask, You and me, then?\n\nHe stepped into his own shadow and shook wet off his hand and tied the thread around the coin that hung at his mouth and the two had a conversation that made his teeth ache in the good way heartbreak done right does. He did not put it in the box at home, because he wasn\u2019t at home, and also because he was beginning to distrust boxes as the answer to constant motion. He tucked it in the pocket over his heart behind three pennies he carried to remind himself of being poor even when he had cash and it lay there with a depth he had not expected. He breathed. The under breathed with him. The dump inhaled and the frogs, generous, sang like a choir that has not been paid and sings anyway and is better for it.\n\nOn his way back to the truck he saw Vespur\u2019s spoor in the dark, not smell this time but absence of smell, a weirdness where the night had refused to carry him any longer and had dropped him like a bad letter. It was in the shape of a man stepping too long on his own guilt. It went into the trees and then across the old road where the tracks had been and then into the trailer park that had been built because men think cheap houses for people they won\u2019t meet is generosity. He could have followed. He did not. He went home because the name in his pocket was heavy and needed to be sat with and because the springs had loaned him grace and he did not want to spend it running.\n\nAt the square the band played and found, halfway through \u201cWagon Wheel,\u201d that their instruments tried to be serious. The drummer couldn\u2019t keep the time he had planned and ended up keeping the time the fountain, now chastened, suggested, and it was better for him though he would argue later. Dobbins, who had practiced a speech about resilience, delivered one about logistics, because he had woken in the afternoon to find the monogram on his towels rearranged to spell a word he couldn\u2019t pronounce. Tansy danced with her baby on her hip and made the baby laugh real this time, the sound not jarred but born, and she set that laugh carefully on top of the day so it couldn\u2019t blow away.\n\nMerritt came up his own steps and the house flexed its warm in a way that didn\u2019t feel like it was trying to sell him anything. He set the thread on the box and then, thinking better, set the box on the thread, and the box liked that and slid, just a hair, in the way a dog will slide toward you if you pretend you\u2019re not asking. He put the kettle on and the kettle boiled and he poured water over coffee and the coffee did the thing where it released its smell like a spell being relieved of duty. He put his hand on the counter and the counter told him about a time his father had stood there drying an apple slice because the power had been out and he\u2019d wanted a snack anyway. He sat and whistled the tune with no words and no room for fear, and though his voice wobbled once it did not break.\n\nWhen the knock came, it was in the polite way of people who don\u2019t knock often because doors are usually open to them. He went and found Rosa with a pie on her hands and Aunt Lydie with eyes that said sleep was a thing men do in other houses. Behind them, Lyle held a bag of ice and looked like a man who wanted to be useful more than he wanted to be right. They stood and didn\u2019t say a single brave thing for a breath that stretched like taffy. Then the baby laughed again from somewhere on the street and the laugh hit the house and the house knew what to do.\n\n\u201cWe ain\u2019t letting you eat alone,\u201d Aunt Lydie said, and walked past him like the door had begged her to be first. Rosa put lemon pie on the table and slid the marlin opener down the nail like she was putting a switchblade away. Lyle put ice in the sink and didn\u2019t trip over the rugs because they\u2019d stopped whispering.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m bringing somebody a story,\u201d Merritt said to the room, and felt the promise sit in it like a new chair that fits everyone. \u201cAnd after that I\u2019m bringing back clean to the parts that Vespur touched. He owes me days. I\u2019m going to make them days you can sleep in, not days so quiet they scratch.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Rosa said. \u201cWe like sleeping. But not too much. We get up mean when we sleep too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to bed after we eat and after we laugh once at a thing that isn\u2019t mean,\u201d Aunt Lydie pronounced, and nobody argued because she had earned that sentence. \u201cTomorrow you and me and that boy with the hat and the baby who laughs are going to go to Mason\u2019s dogs and tell them the under has quit rattling. And then we\u2019re going to make a list of where the stink still is and we\u2019re going to salt it with words and orange and all the other cheap things that cost more than money.\u201d\n\nThey ate and the pie tasted like apology accepted and the coffee held and the night around the house did not bristle. Somewhere Vespur lay in a bed he had not earned and stared at a ceiling that had opinions and thought about debt and how it stung in a place he could not scratch. In the springs, the woman took the jar of names into a crook where clay eats gently and opened it and patted the names like cloth until they forgot what they had been told to be. Under the dump, the turtle settled so his belly touched mud and thought of oranges without wanting them, which for a turtle is progress. Merritt took the thread and his father\u2019s work and braided them in his mouth until one of them became flavor and the other became will, and he slept with the window up so the moss could hear him breathe and know where to bend.",

The heat was not rude yet; it had its shirt on and was putting its socks in order. Merritt woke with it and lay still for one long breath while the house told him the small night news\u2014a palm rat on the eaves who had reconsidered a career in burglary, the oak making an old joint pop, a train two miles off that had grumbled like a man asked to lift his own couch. The thread lay where he had put it under the box and the two had become comfortable with each other in a way that made him feel like he had introduced right friends. He touched the box\u2019s corner and the cedar gave him back the smell of a coat in winter, which in Florida is a fancy habit you keep for a week and then put away generous.\n\nCoffee made the kitchen practical. It hissed like a cat you\u2019d stepped near and then purred because you had gotten the distance right. Aunt Lydie had left behind a good dish towel, the woven kind from a church fair that remembers hands, and he used it to dry his cup and then folded it neat out of respect for how it had come to him. He took his hat off its hook and tucked the marlin opener in his pocket because it had been agreeable the day before and a man would be a fool not to take agreeable along. When he stepped onto the porch, the light came up from the dirt as much as it came down from the sky, and he liked that, liked a day that met him halfway.\n\nThey met at Mason\u2019s because that was how it had been decided when words were short and hands were busy. Mason\u2019s place had the look of a house that had held its breath during a storm and had been told afterward it could breathe and had said, Maybe later. The dogs out front\u2014a pair of brindly creatures that had raccoon in their eyebrows and saint in their ribs\u2014saw Merritt and seen the others and did the complicated tail calculus that says I\u2019m happy, I don\u2019t like this, you brought treats, and you smell like trouble\u2019s dentist. They would not go under the house. They would not go near the steps. They stood and arched their necks and put their noses toward the shadow and told it, We got teeth, but also, We got good sense.\n\nMason stood with his thumbs in his belt loops like a man holding a story in place. He had sleep in his beard and a kindness in his eyes that had put up with more than he ought. \u201cI tried to sweet-talk \u2018em,\u201d he said by way of greeting. \u201cI sang that dumb song they like about the cat and the bird, and I tucked bacon just inside and they said I could eat it myself like a fool. Don\u2019t tell my wife I wasted bacon. I\u2019ll deny it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will not mention bacon except as a philosophical concept,\u201d Aunt Lydie said, stepping onto the first step with her bell clutched in the curve of her arm like a baby you do not hand to folks unless they have proven they can keep their hands low. Rosa, efficient without making you feel scolded for not being so, had a bucket with salt, another with water, a handful of rosemary that wasn\u2019t really for this but smelled like it ought to help. Lyle had his hat on back and a flashlight he had not turned on because he was a Florida boy and knew the difference between light and glare.\n\nMerritt crouched. He did not squint into the orange shade because he wasn\u2019t trying to see a person hiding; he was listening for a house pretending not to gossip. The crawlspace breathed cool, but that was just shade being generous. The smell was layered wrong: damp wood and the good stink of a dog\u2019s belly, the tang of old iron nails, and under that a cheap sweet like a spilled soda that had been wiped up with lies. A lacing of pig fat marks along the joists, sure, but they had been half-hearted, like a man who\u2019d cheated off another man\u2019s paper and gotten the answers wrong in order to not look too neat. This wasn\u2019t just Vespur\u2019s little coins. This was a nest.\n\n\u201cThey built themselves a lair under your kitchen,\u201d Merritt said, and the word was too proud for what the thing was, but he gave it anyway so it would show itself to grin. \u201cA stink-eater with babies. He put it there so you\u2019d step over the smell when you came in, and it would eat your cooking smoke and grow smart on it and tell your pan when to burn eggs. That\u2019s rude.\u201d\n\nMason scrubbed his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me what it looks like so I can have the proper kind of nightmare later?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks like a wet wasp nest taught to breathe,\u201d Merritt said kindly. \u201cDon\u2019t go near it with a broom. It will come apart like old bread and then it will be in your sinuses. We are going to coax it out with food and then we are going to salt its feet and then we are going to send it where it can eat ditch and not cook.\u201d\n\nHe took the orange he had in his bag and peeled it in one long strip because that pleased him and wrapped the peel around the blue rope and let the oil jump like ideas. He didn\u2019t put salt in his mouth; he wasn\u2019t a sailor. He took out the mirror shard and angled it to make a door of light just past the lip of shadow and then he tied the rope around a brick and slid it under in a way that suggested a hand offering a plate and not a trap. The dogs watched, offended and impressed. Rosa went around to the other side and hummed a grocery list under her breath because that\u2019s how you keep ordinary in the air when a thing comes that wants to make everything special wrong.\n\nWhen it moved, it didn\u2019t skitter. It didn\u2019t need legs to do that. It rolled like a fog that got ideas. It found the mirror and tried to be it and failed; the mirror was itself and that is a stubborn position. It lifted on one side and he saw the line of a jar lid and the soggy teeth set along an edge and he said, \u201cNo thank you,\u201d to the part of his mind that wanted to get a stick and jab. The babies rode the mother\u2019s back in snotty little humps that made sound like refrigerator hum heard through a bad dream. The smell lifted with it, tired milk and damp newspaper and the last of a song stuck in a bathroom where a man had shaved badly.\n\nHe snapped the rope. The snap went across the thing and told it it was being rude. It folded, not away but down, and then came out, unhappy about the sun, and he had salt in his hand and he flung it like a man tossing rice at a wedding he suspected was a mistake and the salt hit the front of the blob and made it hiss and split and consider. He did not scatter it. He tapped it with his name and told it the ditch two houses down needed its skills. He made the ditch sound like a job with benefits. The thing opened the part of itself that was an ear and wanted praise and he praised it for eating what humans leave and he said, \u201cGo on, now,\u201d and it went, heavy and silly, babies clinging like gossip.\n\nThe dogs relaxed like a knot coming loose and then, in embarrassment at having relaxed, barked three times at a cricket saying, Look what we did. Mason exhaled a whole story of a sigh. Aunt Lydie blew her bell quiet, the note at the bottom like the sound a jar makes when you take its lid off and it was never meant to open and it\u2019s relieved you did. Rosa took the rosemary and tucked a sprig under the step and said, \u201cFor you,\u201d to the house, and the house said, I will remember you when your hands are tired.\n\n\u201cYou give it the ditch with the ragweed,\u201d Mason said, peering like a man who\u2019s going to write the story bigger tonight for effect and then tell the true version to his wife and hope she lets him keep both.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll keep the mosquitoes from thinking they own that corner,\u201d Merritt said. He patted the shade with two fingers. \u201cDon\u2019t go putting bacon down here no more. That\u2019s my professional advice and my personal plea.\u201d\n\nThey drove up to Juniper with the windows down, the heat now with its shirt in its hand and talkative. Juniper sat the way places sit when they have been pretty too long and learned to expect kindness. The ranger at the little booth recognized Aunt Lydie\u2019s hand at the wheel and waved them in with the concerned camaraderie of a man whose job is watching strangers love his water too hard. The green there has a different vocabulary, longer and stalkier. The smell was clean over the surface, but in the shadows under the thick fern hang there was a taste of sour. A man in a hat you buy when someone tells you there\u2019s a sale had said earlier that his picnic had gone slick under his hands and he\u2019d blamed humidity until his ham had tasted like a coin.\n\nJuniper\u2019s wrong was not Vespur\u2019s, though he had shaken the place. This was old, like the spring woman had told him, a stripe of iron gone into the muscle long back and never worked out. The boardwalk planks here had different tongues than Silver\u2019s, and they argued less. He went to the place he always did, a bend where light made decisions, and put his hand low, fingers in the water so the little fish could come bump him like cousins asking if he brought the good ice. He talked low because the forest liked that. He told them about the iron grate at Silver and the turtle and the jar in the dump and he felt the way news goes under, the long lazy roll that says someone in a room far off doing book-keeping looks up and says, Oh, that\u2019s why the numbers haven\u2019t matched.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not coughing,\u201d Lyle said, as if he\u2019d been bracing for it. He looked pale under the brim. He loved this place privately and wore it like a shirt under his uniform so people wouldn\u2019t think him frivolous.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s holding breath,\u201d Merritt said, and the woman under here did not come up the way the other had; she pushed a handprint up in ripples on the surface and he saw his own hand match it and that was hello enough. \u201cWe stole a fork out of her meat yesterday. Today we convince her she doesn\u2019t have to flinch when a shadow looks like that fork.\u201d\n\nThey salted not the water but the air, which you can do if you\u2019ve learned the trick and don\u2019t waste it on showing off. He breathed orange through his teeth and told a story of a day this week when nobody slipped in a kitchen and the children didn\u2019t throw sand in each other\u2019s hair but did eat sandwiches and remembered to close the bread without being told. Rosa, who had never liked Juniper because of a thing that had happened here when she was nine that she never told long and didn\u2019t need to, squared her shoulders and put her fingers on the rail and let the planks know she forgave them for the day and asked them to try again. Things stopped sticking. The sour shifted from now to then. A man with a sale hat smiled at his ham without knowing why and gave his wife the last bite, and later she would tell him he was sweet and he would say he wasn\u2019t but they\u2019d keep the tone, which is the point.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m counting a day,\u201d Merritt said under his breath on the way back to the truck, so the debt could hear him and not that he minded Lyle hearing too. \u201cHe owes them, and he is paying them like a man who pays in coins that jingle loud so people see him. Fine. I\u2019ll take loud. Quiet isn\u2019t always a blessing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think he\u2019s paying attention to the county calendar?\u201d Lyle asked. He wanted everything to make sense even when it didn\u2019t, which was reasonable for a man whose job was to fit things to forms.\n\n\u201cI think debt has its own reminder system,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cIt pinches the joint when the weather changes. He\u2019ll feel it if he tries to be bad. He\u2019ll be bad anyway. That\u2019s who he is. But he\u2019ll cough in the middle of his own curse. I\u2019ll hear it.\u201d\n\nDobbins caught them on the square like a man catching grasshoppers\u2014the stance, the surprise when one jumps wrong. He had a clipboard to make his hands look occupied and the bow tie he wore when he needed to remind people he was a person and not a man who liked to count taxes. \u201cMr. Harker,\u201d he said, keeping his eyes left of Merritt\u2019s ear like always, a habit born once out of superstition and now out of stubbornness. \u201cI need to discuss liability with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can discuss it while we move tables,\u201d Merritt said, lifting one end of a sad folding table in the shadow of the courthouse that had seen a hundred summers and had judged a hundred idiots, some gently, some not. \u201cYour fountains are behaving. Your square is a square. If we put a story here tonight, it\u2019ll lay flat. You want to be helpful? Sign the paper that says when we bring something ugly here it won\u2019t be counted as a festival unless you arrange a food truck.\u201d\n\nDobbins blinked, and that meant he was buying what he was being sold while trying to pretend he wasn\u2019t. \u201cBring something ugly here? My constituents\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYour constituency breathes what you breathe,\u201d Rosa said, clean as a knife. She had a lemon print scarf around her neck and it made her look like common sense. \u201cThe spring was holding iron. It was our iron. We took it. We\u2019re bringing up the next section when we can. You\u2019re going to help us carry it down Main Street one evening soon. We will lay it on your courthouse steps. You\u2019ll say a thing that doesn\u2019t make excuses. You will stand and you will listen to old ladies hum when they don\u2019t have words. That\u2019s my professional recommendation.\u201d She didn\u2019t have a profession besides making things grow and making men correct themselves with a look, but Dobbins accepted the word for lack of a better one.\n\nLyle was trying not to grin. Mason, who had come to town on the theory that his dogs ought to see a place where pigeons live on pretzel diets, nodded from under a tree and said, to no one and to everyone, \u201cIt would be a good story. People like to carry things if they\u2019re heavy enough to make everybody walk funny. It gives them something to do with their backs.\u201d\n\nDobbins smoothed the paper on his clipboard and his mouth made shape around words that began with regret and ended with growth and got stuck on the way. He was not a bad man; he was a careful one, and careful had mistaken itself for righteous a dozen times in his life and he was trying to teach it manners. \u201cIf we do this,\u201d he said, quietly because the town heard it when mayors get honest and he preferred doing that in rooms with carpet, \u201cif we lay iron on those steps, we don\u2019t get to pretend our water was always for fun. We invite people to say true things. We invite\u2026refuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe flush it,\u201d Merritt said, and the word came out tidy because he meant it in both senses. \u201cWe tell the story before it tells itself in the wrong mouths. We make air. Also, you get to be in the picture later when the paper says Ocala did a hard thing. That\u2019s good politics and I won\u2019t even charge you for that advice.\u201d\n\nDobbins snorted and thought about tearing the paper to give his hands an action and then took his pen and signed like a man who had written his name on checks he didn\u2019t want to cash and then stood anyway in the bank line with his hat in his hands. \u201cDon\u2019t make me regret it,\u201d he said, but he aimed it at the sky in case it had ears for trivial mayoral drama and not at Merritt because he knew who was likely to do the regretting.\n\nThe day sagged into that late afternoon lull where everything that isn\u2019t human knows to be quiet and humans answer by turning on radios. Merritt took himself home long enough to sit on the steps with Tansy and a sweating glass of tea and listen to her describe in exact terms how the world would improve if people would stop tying balloons to mailboxes in this heat. The baby slept like a decision. Vespur\u2019s shadow was not on the road. Merritt could feel his tug, though, a string strummed not hard but constant, out past the old forestry road where the kudzu made new architecture at will. The debt had him, and he had found a way to enjoy even that. Merritt spat a little lemon seed into the yard and the yard accepted it like a secret.\n\nNight came with its frog choir and the tree toad soloists and the chuckle of men half-full of beer and the sigh of women whose ankles had had enough. Merritt took the thread out and did the thing he had been putting off because it felt like art and he never trusted his hands there: he braided it into the band of his hat, quick, unshowy, three over three, and it lay there like it had been waiting on that braid since his father had been a boy whom no one had tied it for. He felt less worried about the box now. Boxes are not wrong, but when a thing wants to go you have to make room for it where things move.\n\nThe springs did not cough. They sent breeze through the park sandwiches and gave a second life to two balloons that had sagged and then thought better. Merritt drove out to the dump for a last check because the woman under had asked him to be quick and he suspected she preferred tidy. The snapping turtle was on his log dreaming industrial dreams. The jar he had freed had sunk again, respectable now, serving as a house for something with legs too many and ambition none. He felt eyes on him and did not turn because some watches are courtesy, not threat, and you don\u2019t embarrass courtesy by catching it.\n\nHalfway back, near the taxidermist, he smelled the ginned-up rot again, thin but there, and knew Vespur had come through, debt pinching. He pulled over because the smell came not from the ditch or the air but from his own chest, and he said, out loud because that sometimes clears a hallway, \u201cI know what you are doing, and I am doing something else. Go on and pay your quiet like a man pays a tab. Don\u2019t be clever. It doesn\u2019t fit you as well as you think.\u201d In response, something in the palmettos coughed twice, the kind of cough that means a man has tried to hold breath and is punished by his own body. Merritt smiled and hated that he liked the sound, because he didn\u2019t want to enjoy hurt, even earned.\n\nThe story for the spring sat with him like a guest waiting to see if he\u2019d offer a second biscuit before dinner. He had promised one that hadn\u2019t happened. He knew the shape of it now: men and women, old and young, carrying iron in their hands and on their shoulders, their faces making that look a person gets when they are doing something embarrassing and correct. He knew the lady at the newspaper would take pictures and he knew which picture would be kept and which would get used online and how the difference would be a whole graduate thesis someday. He knew Dobbins would kiss a baby he didn\u2019t know and curse himself for it because it would look crass and he would then go home and hold his own sleep-heavy child and ask forgiveness from a God who hadn\u2019t been paying attention in a decade but would tonight because of bells.\n\nHe needed bells. He needed too many. He called Aunt Lydie. She picked up on the first ring because she already had the phone in her hand and was waiting to call him but had decided not to in order to teach the phone they were in charge of it. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, not hello. \u201cWe are going to need to borrow from churches. Which ones owe us favors?\u201d\n\n\u201cSt. Elm\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cThey use my rosemary for their Easter lamb. The Pentecostal out on 40 because I told Brother Hart how to keep his well from tasting of coins. Tansy says she can ring dead bells. Ask her to come stand on the courthouse steps and do that without scaring the babies. Rosa will make lemonade that tastes like the answer to a question gently asked. Lyle will put boys at the corners and ask them to stand still which will be the biggest miracle we work all night.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you,\u201d Aunt Lydie said, softer, which meant she was about to throw one of those truths in his lap and walk away, because she had learned how to be kind with a straight back. \u201cYou are going to stand and tell them about the iron and about the jar and about the man who put your daddy on your bed. You are not going to make him the center. You are going to make the work the center. If you call another man by his wrong name, it gives him air. You put your hands on the work. You talk about it like loving. People understand that. It is the story and it will do.\u201d\n\nHe leaned his head back and let the roof of the cab hold him a second and thought about the way a braid feels when you get it right and your fingers stop arguing with time. \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d he said. \u201cHe can run circles like a rodeo. I can lay a line.\u201d\n\nThe plan got legs with an ease that told him it was the right size for the town. He didn\u2019t have to push; he had to steer. Dobbins surprised him twice by seeing ahead of a problem and by not insisting on a podium that would get splinters in old women\u2019s palms. Mason brought a dolly with one wheel that didn\u2019t work and then fixed the wheel on the courthouse steps with a satisfaction that redeemed half the sins men have committed with wrenches. The boys Lyle set at corners went solemn at the weight in the air and forgot to look at their phones because sometimes people are better when no one is grading them.\n\nNight gathered glass into its pockets. The spring held its blue down low like a woman tucking her slip because she was not confident of the dress. Merritt stood on the steps and saw faces he loved and faces he did not know and faces he\u2019d argued with and faces he\u2019d kissed and one face he\u2019d punched in ninth grade and they all had their mouths pursed in that way people get when trying not to chew on their own pride. He held the hat that had his father\u2019s thread in it, not up like a banner but down like a promise. He felt Vespur watching in the way a rat watches, not out of malice\u2014rats are not evil\u2014out of that specialization that says, Who brings the cheese and what do I owe it later.\n\nHe spoke plain. He didn\u2019t turn his voice pretty or rough. He told them about iron in a throat, about jars that carried names where names go to curdle, about a blue rope and a bell and a turtle who negotiated fair. He said Vespur\u2019s name once in the dirt of his mouth and not again. He said his father\u2019s work twice and didn\u2019t say his name at all. He said, \u201cWe carried iron there and we\u2019re going to carry iron here and everyone who takes hold of it will know how it feels to correct something you didn\u2019t do and are responsible for anyway,\u201d and he left the sentence there for people to climb on.\n\nThey carried. The bars were heavier in story than in steel, which is the proper way round, because a man can always get help to lift a bar but it\u2019s harder with the other. The grunt went up from the group the way geese talk to each other in flight\u2014low reassurance, a check-in that requires no answer. Aunt Lydie rang her bell once, long and low, and Tansy let hers chime in that way only she heard, a ghost line for anyone who needed one. Dobbins did not speak, bless him. He took his end and he moved and when it was done he stepped back and let other men talk. Rosa held a paper cup to every palm that needed to shake and Lyle looked at the corners and decided no boy would need to be told twice to keep their feet down tonight.\n\nAfter, when the iron sat there cooling like a bread pan and the courthouse steps took its imprint into their confidence, Merritt felt the debt move under his ribs in the way debts do when they have had a payment, not satisfied but willing to stop tapping their watch. The woman under would like this story. It would improve the air. He imagined telling her and he imagined her saying only, Yes, because she was not a god and did not clap.\n\nHe went home with the sweetness of lemon and sweat in his shirt and set his hat on the hook and touched the braid and the braid hummed like a fence line not singing, just being itself the way it is when you\u2019ve tied it right. He sat at the table and a moth made a spiral at the light and tapped the shade like a very tiny bell bringing in the very last of the day\u2019s stragglers. Outside, the bottle tree sang three notes of its own accord because the wind told it a joke and it didn\u2019t have words to tell it back. He put his hands on the wood and the wood remembered everything it had held that day and did not ask for more. He closed his eyes and tried to sleep and instead found his mother\u2019s tune and held it and if he dreamed, it was of iron left in the sun until old hands could warm themselves on it without getting burned.",

                              "content": "Chapter nine came in like a fan on low, steady and a little apologetic, moving the heat around instead of beating it. The quiet Vespur owed had held for eight days in a row, which was a miracle by any county\u2019s accounting and a torment by his. Quiet looks different when you\u2019ve had noise. Folks caught themselves listening for the stink the way you listen for a whippoorwill after you\u2019ve got used to the song, and when it didn\u2019t come they pretended they hadn\u2019t been braced and went about their doing. Merritt woke into that hush with a feeling like his bones had been filed true. The house told him nothing of great solemnity: a blue jay had dropped a pecan on the porch rail and missed; an ant had found a seam of sugar on the counter and been persuaded to try the yard instead; the bottle tree had dreamt of glass with sea still in it. He lay and counted the breaths between cicada phrases and thought, If he is paying, he is saving to spend.\n\nBy noon the phone had made three small rattles and one long hum, all of them men telling him ordinary things with the unusual threaded through. Mason\u2019s wife said the good towels had gone soft like they\u2019d been washed in rainwater and she took it as a sign to be kind to her sister. Tansy said she had heard her dead bells at exactly seven and then again at seven-oh-seven and asked if that meant a joke or an error, and when he asked her what the bells sounded like she said they were shy this time, like a child practicing its name in a mirror. Lyle\u2019s voice was the long hum, which meant he had stayed calm for a while and then decided he had earned the right to be not. \u201cStorm drains are singing,\u201d he said, and then said, \u201cI know that sounds like you, but I mean it literal. Boys on skateboards say the grates make a chord when they go by. Also, manhole covers sweating. Also, two cats sitting and staring into the same hole like it owes them money. I\u2019ll send you a picture if you ask nice.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t send me a picture,\u201d Merritt said, putting coffee on the stove and the towel over his shoulder because it made him feel like he was the kind of man kitchens confide in. \u201cMeet me by the old feed store. The alley there\u2019s low and it collects everybody\u2019s ideas of drainage. Bring a boy who knows not to fall down, and bring a broom like you mean it.\u201d\n\nThe alley had a personality like old socks, but it had its uses. Folks had been pushing rain that way for a hundred years and the ground had learned to be grateful. The grate by the downspout did indeed have a tone, a low one that wanted to be kind and kept getting interrupted by an edge. Lyle tested it with the toe of his boot and made the sound wobble, and the boy beside him\u2014Hector, the one who was quiet until he wasn\u2019t and then had useful opinions about engines\u2014tilted his head and nodded solemnly like a man listening to an engine he planned to forgive. Merritt crouched and put his ear to the iron and let it say its piece. Under the sound there was a taste, and under that a habit, and under that a decision somebody had made who\u2019d never had call to use the word municipal. The drains had begun to learn harmony. They were not good at it. They were trying to sing through a mouthful of rags.\n\nHe unrolled the blue rope and unwound three oranges he\u2019d put in his bag without thinking and then congratulated himself for the part of his brain that planned ahead while he slept. He cut the peel in long strips and laid them on the iron until the oil came up cheap and bright, and the smell pushed a little at the sour. He touched the mirror shard to the grate and the grate looked at itself the way a person does when they catch their reflection in a shop window and aren\u2019t ready to own it. The tone steadied. He could feel the ditch behind the taxidermist down the street perk up, hungry as ever and not picky about source. \u201cWe\u2019re going to give this alley something else to love,\u201d he said, and wrapped the rope around the grate and tied a knot a child could undo and then a knot a sailor would approve and then a knot of his own invention that said, No more surprises.\n\nThe thing in the throat of the drain rolled and tasted the orange and backed up like a cat caught off guard appreciating a new smell. It wasn\u2019t malicious. It was a wet mind with a job that had been badly described to it. Vespur had sent it formally, with pig fat and a handful of pennies and a lie about purpose, and it had believed with the earnestness of small organisms. \u201cYou get the ragweed ditch,\u201d Merritt told it, not cruel, not bribing; he really did have something better to offer. \u201cIt\u2019s full of paper cups and old shade and sometimes bacon if Mason\u2019s wife has a guest she likes. You go police that and grow smart on it and leave this alley to its own nonsense. We\u2019ll leave you oranges if you prove you can be polite.\u201d\n\nIt tested him, because anything with teeth does, even if the teeth are only a habit of clinging. It sent up a rope of smell and wrapped it around the boy\u2019s ankle as if to see if men could be tripped into meanness. Hector stood very still, which was the right choice when the ground tries to make you do slapstick. Merritt snapped the rope in his hand and the snap traveled down like a hard no. He felt Vespur\u2019s hand on the other end, light as a lie told in passing, and he felt Vespur pull back not because he was chastened but because he had other threads in his fingers and could not afford to get them tangled. The thing rolled off into the ditch the way a bad idea leaves your mouth when you see your aunt in the doorway, and the grate sighed like furniture. The tone went true. Lyle shouldered the broom in relief as if it had been his part of the work all along. The boy grinned and said nothing, but later he would tell his mother he had watched a man ask a drain to behave and it had and she would say, That\u2019s a good use of a Tuesday.\n\nBack at the house Aunt Lydie had her map out, which did not look like a map so much as a quilt that had learned to be administrative. She had put pins in it for places that were paid, places that owed, and places that didn\u2019t believe in accounting yet and would have to be taught. She was muttering to herself and to three skeleton keys she had laid on the table with a kind of exasperated fondness. \u201cChurch keys,\u201d she said when he came in, and when he smiled because he could count a joke as quick as the next man she clucked at him without meanness. \u201cNo. Real ones. St. Elm\u2019s, Hart\u2019s, and the First Practice House they built for a congregation that never got past the number twelve. He left jars there like he left jars in that truck. You go ahead and don\u2019t be surprised. If he can\u2019t have an audience he\u2019ll make a rehearsal.\u201d\n\nHe whistled the kettle to boil and set out two cups because when Aunt Lydie had keys on the table she wasn\u2019t leaving for a minute. She gave him the shape of the thing she had seen in the seams of the day: not a revival, exactly, but a calling up of breath. Vespur wanted to make the town take a breath together, in a place he chose, at a time he chose, and then make the exhale be his, a ribbon he could step on and say, See, dance for me. He had put jars under pews to teach the wood to remember cheap hymns and under the air returns to make the smell go round and round like praise that had lost its words. He had put a flier up at the Fox and Oak for a thing he had named with irritating accuracy: Blessing of the Air. Rosa had pulled one of the fliers down and brought it folded and sour to the table. It had a smudge that looked like someone had pressed an orange slice to it out of spite and he liked Rosa better for that if that were possible.\n\n\u201cSkate rink,\u201d he read, because of course it was. The place had been abandoned when the county decided children ought to learn to make their own fun without supervision. The rink had floors that still hummed in straight lines and corners where prayers had been whispered with hands on the back pockets of jeans. It had a low ceiling that had learned to be a sky. \u201cHe wants to use the fans.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants the fans to use us,\u201d Aunt Lydie said dry, and flicked the smallest key with a fingernail. \u201cHe owes you quiet. He is making himself a place to spend his noise. He won\u2019t wait until the debt is done. He never has. He never will. We will do air work tonight, and we will keep people from associating his name with fresh. You bring your rope. You bring your mirror. You bring whatever you use when you aren\u2019t sure if you\u2019re going to have to be rude.\u201d\n\n\u201cI bring my marlin,\u201d he said, patting his pocket, and she shook her head like a woman and a mother and an aunt all at once, amused and resigned to loving a fool when he\u2019s right.\n\nThe rink smelled like a locker room had married a carnival and not told their parents. The parking lot had acquired pine straw in drifts that made men look thoughtful about rakes. The front door had been kept shut by a chain put through its handles and then undone by a bolt cutter sometime last week by hands that had wanted to be helpful to the wrong cause. There were posters still up for themed nights that had never happened and a trophy case with three trophies, none of which had names attached anymore because names in cases slip off when nobody looks. Under all that, in the HVAC, in the vents, in the gap under the DJ booth, the wrong breathed.\n\nPeople had come. People always come when a man says he\u2019s going to bless something and charges a donation. They came because the day had felt like a coat that didn\u2019t quite fit and because someone had used words like cool and free and because there was a table in the corner with a punch bowl and a woman who had been told to smile. Merritt watched their faces and saw nothing he didn\u2019t recognize: a man who had worked in the sun all day and wanted a different kind of sweat, a woman who had been alone too long this week and needed to be near the sound of other people\u2019s shoes, a pair of teenagers who\u2019d come because anywhere with a ceiling and no parents is a church of its own. He saw Vespur at the far end of the room and would have known him even if the smell hadn\u2019t sewn itself into the light.\n\nVespur had cleaned up for the occasion. He had combed his hair and patted down his coat and put a flower in his lapel that did not deserve the company it kept. He had a microphone, not because he needed one but because he wanted one; he liked the way his voice sounded when bounced off electronics. The jars were under the bleachers, lined with care, and the air returns had been garlanded with burlap that had a smell like barns that weren\u2019t honest. He had put his organ back together with borrowed parts, and the fans were his pipes. He saw Merritt and the smile that cracked his face was complicated, not triumph, not even gloat, but a kind of affection for worthy opposition that would read as condescension in weaker men and was a present in this one.\n\n\u201cYou came to breathe,\u201d he said into the mic, and the speakers turned his voice into a version of thunder for people who had never been outside in a storm. \u201cThat\u2019s good. People forget how. I will teach you. It will be clean. It will be easy. It will be me and you and the air between deciding to behave.\u201d\n\nMerritt had his rope out in his hands and it looked like a belt to anyone else, which was fine. He had four box fans too, borrowed from behind the feed store and from Lyle\u2019s garage and from Rosa\u2019s nursery, and he set them in the corners on chairs and cut lemons in front of them until the air started to look like it had remembered kitchens where nobody cried. Aunt Lydie set her keys on the ledge at the back and put salt in their mouths so if a door tried to open that wasn\u2019t theirs it would get a mouthful of ocean and reconsider. Tansy stood on the middle of the floor with the baby on her hip and her spoon in her hand because she had said once irons made her think of scars and she saw no need to rile herself on purpose. She looked like a woman about to stir a pot and instead stirred the air by standing the way you do when you\u2019re ready for whatever.\n\nVespur began with kindness, which was his slyest move. \u201cIn,\u201d he said, and the crowd did, and there is nothing wrong with synchrony when it is offered, but his voice had in it a suggestion that the exhale belonged to him. \u201cOut,\u201d he said, and the vents pulled because somebody at the power panel had been co-opted into evil and given a story about electricity that made him feel useful. Merritt listened and waited. He did not want to scold a room out of a breath that was theirs to take. He put the mirror on the floor and picked up the rope and tied knots that looked like decoration and then breathed through his teeth so the lemons would help. He tasted the quarter and it shocked his mouth back on purpose.\n\nIt broke when Vespur tried to say a name he shouldn\u2019t have. He lifted his hand for the third breath to ride on and he said, \u201cBoy,\u201d and it was the way he had made it sound at the phone, the way he had put it on the bed, the way he had tried to make Merritt hop. But the thread in Merritt\u2019s hat band hummed, not loud, just honest, and the bell in Aunt Lydie\u2019s pocket answered, and Tansy shook her spoon once and the baby on her hip laughed in a way that stripped paint off old fear. The room hiccuped like a congregation correcting an off-key hymn by singing louder on the next line. Merritt stepped into the aisle and raised his own hand and clapped out a rhythm that he had used on a mare and at a porch and in a kitchen when a kettle hadn\u2019t wanted to cooperate. It was a rhythm with clapping built in, the old songs. People looked at him, because he wasn\u2019t on the stage and the stage wasn\u2019t working, and then they looked at each other. The teenagers started first because they weren\u2019t jaded. The old men joined because they remembered. People clapped, not loud, not angry, steady, and with the clapping the room decided to be itself.\n\nVespur laughed, because of course he did, and tried to ride the clapping by counting wrong. He gestured and the jars under the bleachers did their trick, humming at a griefy frequency that makes tears think they have errands, and Merritt brought his rope down low and snapped and the snap made a seam in the sound big enough for civility to walk through. The fans took lemon and carried it to the vents and the vents, which had wanted to be praised and had been taught to be used, reconsidered the size of the job. Rosa, over by the punch, had quietly tipped a bowl of rosemary into the nearest return and the smell took up arms for the living. Lyle saw the man at the power panel and stood near him, not threatening, not not, the official weight of law acting as ballast on a night that wanted to get away from itself.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me be mean,\u201d Merritt said, and he said it not to Vespur but to the room, which had the power to decide whether men had to resort to that kind of work. \u201cBreathe if you want to. Don\u2019t if you won\u2019t. Clap if you can. If you can\u2019t, stamp your foot. If you can\u2019t, blink. We will do this together and we will not put anyone in charge of anyone\u2019s lungs.\u201d\n\nThe room believed him because you cannot fake that tone, you can only maintain or fail it. The breath broke up into human sizes. The clapping made the jars under the bleachers show themselves by vibrating a fraction out of their line, and Hector and two other boys on borrowed courage crawled under and dragged them out and handed them to Rosa who set them open under the fans where lemon and rosemary and ordinary air could speak to their contents. The sound changed from a pulse to a murmur people could ignore if they wanted. Vespur\u2019s face peeled back to a frown like a man\u2019s hand getting stuck in a jar when he\u2019d thought he knew the trick and didn\u2019t.\n\nHe stepped off the stage because he knew stages were dangerous when not his. He came straight for Merritt, which was a kind of courtesy if you looked at it sideways. The two of them took the middle of the floor and the town widened itself around them like a skirt. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to enjoy yourself,\u201d Vespur said, close enough that the lemon on his breath made the stink tell on itself. \u201cYou get things done. You don\u2019t ever get tired of being right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI get tired of being interrupted,\u201d Merritt said, and pressed the quarter to Vespur\u2019s sternum, not his forehead this time because this wasn\u2019t about thought. This was about breath. He held it there, through coat and flower and all the ways Vespur had padded himself against consequence, and he said quietly enough that only the man and the air between them heard, \u201cPay. Don\u2019t try to tip with nonsense. Days. In order. No more spending my mornings while you make your evenings interesting.\u201d\n\nVespur gasped, not theater but a little, the coin burning old promises back through his flesh like a book being read aloud backward briefly. He grinned because he always could when a man would be gnashing teeth. \u201cYou going to put me on a cross next?\u201d he asked, sharp. \u201cLay me on your steps? Name me in your prayers? You love me. I make you into the man you want to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a mirror I don\u2019t hang in my house,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cYou\u2019re a tool I don\u2019t let kids near. You\u2019re a lesson I won\u2019t let be the last one. Breathe on your own time.\u201d He took his hand away not because he was done but because the coin needed to sit and hum without being held. He felt it grip through coat and into bone and the hum rolled out like a ripple catching more ripples by the shoulder and lining them up. Vespur\u2019s knees said a sentence that had the word interest in it and he bent a fraction like a man reconsidering pride in public.\n\nThe last blade was small, because he didn\u2019t have room for a big one. That was Vespur\u2019s genius: making small cuts look like luck. He pumped his mic hand once as if by habit and the speakers coughed with the baby cry again, that jarred note he kept in his throat for when a decent man needed to be tripped. It went through the room like a rumor. Three women turned their heads by instinct, Tansy\u2019s baby, down by her knee now fussing with a shoe string, blinked and frowned like he had been drafted and didn\u2019t appreciate it. Merritt didn\u2019t move. He let the cry land and die where it ought to, as a trick heard and not believed. The town watched his shoulders, saw they didn\u2019t jump, and took their cue like a choir takes pitch from the alto because the alto is tired of waiting on the tenor.\n\nIt could have gone longer. It didn\u2019t need to. Once the fans had made the air remember itself and the jars had been opened and forgiven, the rink lost interest in being a church. It went back to remembering corners where a person had been kissed and had decided about who they were without using a sermon for it. The crowd unwove without anyone calling it, and people shook their hands and said their good nights and took paper cups into the parking lot to throw in a can somebody had thought to set by the door. The teens stayed to the very end because they wanted to see if the adults would break, and when the adults didn\u2019t and instead stacked chairs and laughed at each other in a way that made you want to live to be forty, the teens filed the night as a data point that people can be useful without being boring.\n\nVespur stood by the DJ booth, one hand on it like he was a boy steadying himself after getting out on deep water. He breathed, because he had to, and the coin vibrated sternum to spine. He looked at Merritt with a melancholy he didn\u2019t often let show. \u201cYou\u2019ll pick up everything I spill,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll do it until your back gives. You\u2019ll make an art of it and nobody will clap after a while because they\u2019ll forget the tricks are hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t need to clap,\u201d Merritt said, and this time he let the meanness show not in words but in willingness to stand and not soften. \u201cI don\u2019t need you either. But you need me, and that\u2019s your hurt.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Vespur said, and he pushed off the booth and the stink came up from where he had kept it too long in a pocket and he let it go, a small mercy for himself, and the room shrugged and opened the door and it went outside where night collected bad habits and let the good ones sleep. \u201cMaybe I need you to be worth hating. That\u2019s a spice too.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can cook with salt,\u201d Aunt Lydie said as she came up to stand beside Merritt, her bell dangling slack with that pleased heaviness bells get when they\u2019ve rung enough for one kitchen. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to use meat that\u2019s turned. Go home.\u201d\n\nVespur left like a man leaving a bar at closing time without having paid for his drinks but having left his name written under the table for the next man to find. He did not look back. He didn\u2019t have to. He left his debt walking in front of him like a big dog you can\u2019t leash because you\u2019ve convinced yourself it loves you. The room rolled its shoulders and settled. The fans spun out the last of the lemon and then made do with night.\n\nOn the way out Tansy caught Merritt\u2019s sleeve with the spoon hand and said, \u201cYou felt that?\u201d and he said he had, and she said, \u201cDead bells got confused and then they got curious. Curious is better. It means we can teach. I\u2019ll be at St. Elm\u2019s in the morning if you want me to count pews with my ears and tell you which ones talk back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll count together,\u201d he said. \u201cBring the boy. He claps on time. That\u2019s a gift.\u201d\n\nHe drove around the long way to his house because the roads like to be checked on before bed and because he wanted to feel the town do its own breathing without help. It did. The ditch with the ragweed burbled, pleased with its surprise snack, and he put an orange peel there like a tip and the water preened. The bottle tree whispered to him as he passed, glass bright in the moon, and he whispered back because some courtesies feel necessary even when you are tired. He parked and got out and the porch boards gave him that extra bounce they always did when he came home in one piece, and he stood a second and waited to see if the house had advice. It didn\u2019t. It was content, which is a rarer state than joy and more durable.\n\nHe took the hat down and fingered the braid. The thread hummed like a wire that has been tightened properly after a long time of sagging. He could feel there was still a knot somewhere else, not in Vespur\u2019s pocket anymore, not in the dump jar, not under his bed pretending innocence. He thought about the Fox and Oak, about the old cannery, about the mirror in the truck with the angel-drunken glass. He thought about a sign out near the racetrack that had three bolts and one that had been replaced with a nail because somebody had been too tired to drive back to the shed, and how the nail made the sign vibrate wrong when the wind hit it. Names attach to small things. Vespur knew that. So did he. He had time now because he had bought it with other men\u2019s carrying and with lemon and with a quarter. Time is the dearest coin. You spend it best when you aren\u2019t trying to impress.\n\nMorning showed up wearing the shape of a church before the hour made people believe in it. St. Elm\u2019s smelled like wood oil and dust and lilies in a way that made even nonbelievers adjust their shoulders to fit the room. The pews had jars under them because of course they did, and they had to be addressed not with smashing but with teaching. Hearts remember. Wood does too. Tansy walked the aisle and did what she does, bells in her head making a map of the quiet. Her baby slept with his mouth open because that\u2019s how a body tells you it trusts a building. Aunt Lydie stood in the back and cracked the door and let the morning in to see what they were doing, heavy with humidity and news from the river. Merritt knelt and took a jar with both hands and said, \u201cNo,\u201d and then said, \u201cYes,\u201d and the difference made the air feel less like apology and more like invitation. Rosa had brought sprigs of something that used to be called balm and she tucked them at each end, and when old Miss Etta, who had sat in that church since she had had two good knees, came and saw them there she nodded like someone had put a blanket over a sleeping child.\n\nHe found it at the sign by the racetrack because he had known he would. The wind had a catch in it there, and the catch had a vowel tucked into it like a burr in a sock. He took a ladder because he was not a man for guitars in public but he believed in getting high safely. Lyle held it, because he liked to, and because he wanted to practice the stance of a man who keeps another from falling. He pried the nail out with the marlin opener because tools like doing work outside their job sometimes, and the nail came like a boy changing his mind. Under it, wrapped around the bolt that had been meant to be there, was the strand, small and taut, like the end of a seam in a shirt a man had tugged without thinking until it got into his palm. He unthreaded it, careful, apologizing to the sign with his mouth because men had hammered it wrong and signs hold grudges when their work is made less by sloth. He braided the bit into his hat band with the rest and felt the song in it settle, not finished\u2014a thing like this doesn\u2019t finish, it finds its right place\u2014but not looking around for a door to run through anymore.\n\nThat evening, when the light did that thing it did in Ocala where it pretends to be from somewhere else so you remember to pick it up and look, he walked down to the spring. He did not expect a pageant. He didn\u2019t get one. The woman under didn\u2019t rise; she is not a god. She sent a ripple up to meet his finger and that was enough. He told her the story he had promised before it went to the paper, before the men at the bar told it wrong and funnier and then half-right again. He told her about the iron cooling on the courthouse steps, about boys sober for an hour by accident because something heavy needed carrying, about a mayor who had signed a paper and kept his speech, about bells rung by a woman who hears them whether you believe or not. He told it without clever ending or moral posed up like a scarecrow. He let the words be work. The spring listened and it took the story into its water the way a mother takes a sweater into her lap and fixes the worn places while talking about a recipe.\n\n\u201cBetter,\u201d she said without making air vibrate, the yes of a door closing behind a guest who has come in on the right foot. \u201cYou owe me nothing but the same. When you make another one, you bring it. I will keep you if you keep me.\u201d\n\nHe walked home thinking about keeping, about boxes and hats and jars and how his father had kept nails sorted in coffee tins with labels that only he could decode because the labels were not on the tins but in the way he had put them on the shelf. He thought about Vespur with a coin singing against his breastbone and whether that song got into his dreams or if he\u2019d learned to sleep with noise so young it didn\u2019t register as anything but daylight. He thought about the babies born in this heat who will learn to wait until the storm is over to cry and who will be right. He put his hand on his door and the door remembered to open with hope instead of habit. He made coffee after supper because he wanted to be perverse and he drank it on the steps and the mosquitoes recognized his blood and left him alone because some days a man should be allowed to just drink and be. He whistled the tune with no words and no room for fear and this time it didn\u2019t shake at all.",
